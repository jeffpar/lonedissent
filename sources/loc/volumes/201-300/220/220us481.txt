SAC AND FOX INDIANS OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN
IOWA v. SAC AND FOX INDIANS OF THE MISSISSIPPI IN OKLAHOMA, AND THE UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 614.

Argued December 14, 15, 1910.-Decided April 24, 1911.

The provision in the act of August 30, 1852, c. 103, § 3, 10 Stat. 41, 56,
forbidding payment of Indian annuities to any attorney or agent
and requiring the same to be paid to the Indians or to the tribe did
not give any vested rights to the Ihdians but was a direction to agents
of the United States.
In the Indian treaties under consideration in this case the Government dealt with the tribes and not with individuals, and the treaties
gave rights only to the tribes and not to the members.
Under the act of Mar. 1, 1907, c. 2290, 34 Stat. 1055, authorizing this
suit, the action is analogous to one at law to recover money paid
under mistake of law or fact, rather than one in equity, and this
court follows the rule not to go behind the findings of the Court of
Claims. United States v. Old Settlers, 148 U. S.427, distinguished.

OCTOBER TERM, 1910.
Opinion of the Court.

220 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the judgment of the
court.

This is a suit brought by the Sac and Fox Indians of the
Mississippi in Iowa against the Sacs and Foxes in Oklahoma and against the United States, under the act of
March 1, 1907, c. 2290, 34 Stat. 1055. That statute gave
"full legal and equitable jurisdiction, without regard to
lapse of time," to the Court of Claims to hear and determine "as justice and equity may require, with right of
appeal" to this court, all claims of the plaintiffs against
the defendants for their alleged "proportionate shares, according to their numbers," not already paid to or for them,
of appropriations for fulfilling treaty stipulations, or arising from the disposal or sale of the tribes' lands, including certain claims to be stated. Reports of Departments
printed as Congressional documents are made evidence,
to "be given such weight as the court may determine for
them." The claims made are (1) for-annuities between
1855 and 1866, both inclusive; (2) for the difference between the sums paid and those alleged to have been due

from 1867 to 1884; (3) for a similar difference from 1884
to date; (4) for a sum alleged to be due for pay of the
plaintiffs' chiefs; (5) for the plaintiffs' share of the proceeds of tribal lands disposed of under a treaty of 1859.
The case was heard on the evidence furnished by the above
mentioned documents, the petition was dismissed, and
the plaintiffs took'this appeal. 45 Ct. Cl. 287.
'The facts found by the Court of Claims, abridged, are
as follows. Under the treaty of October 11, 1842, 7 Stat.
596, the tribes in question ceded the land then occupied by
them in the Territory of Iowa, were assigned a tract in
•What now is Kansas, and removed thither in 1845, 1846;
then numbering 2278, and, in 1851, 2660 persons. In
1855 and from 1862 t6 1866 certain members, number unknown, without permission from the United States, re-

turned to what had been a part of the IoWa reservation.
Their motives are immaterial. On July 15, 1856, the
legislature of Iowa passed an act giving the consent :of the
State that the Indians (Sacs and Foxes) 'now residing' in
Tama County, but none others, be permitted to remain
there; providing for a census, and requesting the Governor to inform the Secretary of War and urge the payment to such Indians of their proportion of the annuities
due or to become due to the tribe. The number of Indians
embraced in the act does not appear. From 1855 to 1866
there was no agent of the United States with the Iowa
band, although its existence was known. A special agent
took a census on May 31, 1866, which gave the whole
number as 264 and he spent on account of annuities for
them $5,359.06. Except this sum, all the annuities and
other monies of the tribe were paid out at the Sac and Fox
agency, Kansas. Whether any Indians returned to Kansas and received payments there does not appear. At
this time,. up to 1867, annuities were paid subject to the
act of August 30, 1852, c. 103, §3, (10 Stat. 41, 56), which
forbade payment to be made to any attorney or agent and
required it to be made directly to the Indians themselves
or to the tribe per capita, "unless the imperious interest
of the Indian or Indians, or some treaty stipulation, shall
require the payment to be made otherwise, under the
direction of the President." The policy and practice of
the. Government were to pay no annuities to Indians absent from reservations without leave, as were the Iowa
band, and nothing to the contrary is implied by the act
of 1852.
We interrupt the recital of facts to dispose at this point
of the first claim made by the plaintiffs. The act of 1852
gave-no vested rights to individuals. It was not a grant
to the Indians but a direction to agents of the United
States, subject to other directions from the President.
See Wisconsin & Michigan Ry. Co. v. Powers, 191 U. S.

379, 387. The Government did not deal with individuals
but with tribes. Blackfeather v. United States, 190 U. S.
368, 377. See Fleming v. McCurtain, 215 U. S. 56. The
promises in the treaties under which the annuities were due
were promises to the tribes. Treaties of November 3, 1804,
7 Stat. 84; October 21, 1837, 7 Stat. 540; October 11, 1842,
7 Stat. 596. See treaty of October 1, 1859,15 Stat. 467.
So the treaty of February 18, 1867, in article 21, speaks of
"the funds arising from or due the nation under this or previous treaty stipulations," and of payments to bands. 15
Stat. 495, 504. Moreover, when the Government decided
to pay only at the tribal agency, and then paid the whole
amount due, we must presume, at this distance of time, that
its decision was made under the direction of the President.
The Court of Claims adds as yet a further reason for
rejecting this claim that it does not appear how many of
the Iowa Indians returned to Kansas to receive their
annuities, but (therein varying from the statement of
facts found), that it does appear that some of them did.
The course of the Government is sanctioned in principle
by the implication of the treaty of October 1, 1859, article 7, 15 Stat. 467, 469. That article recites the anxiety of the Sacs and Foxes that all members of the
tribes should share the advantages of the treaty, invites
non-resident members to come in and provides for notice
to them, but adds the condition that those who do not
rejoin and permanently reunite with the tribe within one
year shall not have the benefit of any of the stipulations
in the treaty contained.
'On February 18, 1867, another treaty
was made,
amended September 2, 1868, proclaimed on October 14,
1868, 15 Stat. 495, by which the tribes sold their lands
in Kansas to the United States and agreed to remove to
a reservation in what now is the State of Oklahoma.
Article 21 was like article 7 of the treaty of 1859, just
mentioned, with a condition that no part of the funds

Opinion of the Court.

due to the nation under this or previous treaties should
be paid to any bands or parts of bands not pernianently
residing on the reservation, except those residing in Iowa.
15 Stat. 504. The soon following Indian appropriation act
of March 2, 1867, c. 173, 14 Stat. 492, 507, provided, as
permitted by the treaty of 1859, art. 6, that the band of
Sacs and Foxes "now in Tama County, Iowa, shall be
paid pro rata, according to their numbers, of the annuities,
so long as they are peaceful and have the assent of the
government of Iowa to reside in that State." This is
subject to the same comment as the act of 1852 when
relied upon as a foundation for individual rights under it.
From 1867 through .1884, the Iowa Indians were paid
$11,174.66 as their proportion of the annuities, although
they protested. and for a time refused to receive the same.
The matter was settled by a clause in the act of May 17,
1882, c. 163, 22 Stat. 78, "That hereafter the Sacs and
Foxes of Iowa shall have apportioned to them from appropriations for fulfilling the stipulations of said treaties no
greater sum thereof than that heretofore set apart for
them." This by implication ratified the previous estimates and leaves no more to be said as to the second
claim-(for the time from 1867 to 1884). It is suggested.
to be sure that the act of 1882 was repealed by the act of
1884, but as will be seen directly it was not repealed so far
as it affected this claim. After the act of 1882 the Iowa
Indians consented to receive the apportioned sum. We
may add that there is nothing to show that all the Indians

full share.

appropriated in this act, subject to provisions of treaties
with said tribes; but this shall apply only to the Sacs and
Foxes now in Iowa: And provided further, That this shall
apply only to original Sacs and Foxes now in Iowa to be
ascertained by the Secretary of the Interior." As to the
word 'original' we may compare the proviso in the Act of
March 2, 1867, stated above. The Secretary of the Interior ascertained the number to be 317 and the number
on the Oklahoma reservation to be 505 in 1884 and 513
in 1887. He accordingly apportioned the proper fund in
the proportion of 317 to 505 in 1885 and 1886, and afterwards, to 1907, in the proportion of 317 to 513. The
plaintiffs attempt to go behind this ascertainment by the
Secretary. But here for a third time we are dealiug with
a statute, not with a treaty. There is no intimation of an
intent to change the terms of the treaties by which the
contracts were made not with individuals but with the
tribes. The statute neither changed nor conferred rights.
It simply directed the Secretary of the Interior how the
contracts of the United States should be performed. They
were performed as directed, to the seeming satisfaction of
the representatives of the contractees, and there is an end
of the matter. Here again we may add that although it
is argued that the evidence shows that the Secretary's
estimate was too small for years after 1887, the evidence
does not show that the additional Indians were or represented original Sacs and Foxes" now [i. e. on July 4, 1884,]
in Iowa." This disposes of the third claim.
However, the Iowa Indians. not being satisfied and
having presented a memorial to Congress setting up their
present claims except that for pay of their chiefs, the act
of March 2, 1895, c. 188, 28 Stat. 876, 903, directed the
Secretary of the Interior to ascertain whether under any
treaties or acts of Congress any amount was justly due
to them from the members of the tribe in Oklahoma by
reason of any unequal distribution. The Secretarv fojind

that a certain sum was due from the amount appropriated
by act of April 10, 1869, c. 16, 16 Stat.. 13, 35, in payment
.for the Kansas lands ceded by the treaty of 1867, but
nothing more. This sum was paid.. Act of June 10, 1896
c. 398, 29 Stat.-321, 331.
The fourth claim- is based upon article 4 of the treaty
of 1842, by which it was agreed that each of the principal
chiefs should receive five hundred dollars annually, "out
of the annuities payable to the tribe, to be used and expended by them for such purposes as. they may think
proper, with the approbation of their agent." This like
the -rest of the treaty was a promise not to the chiefs bui
to the tribe, gave the chiefs rio vested rights and was subject to such qualification in its performance as to the parties might seem fit. Whether a payment to Iowa chiefs
would have been performance may be doubted, and certainly if the parties saw fit to treat the chiefs on the reservation as the only ones to be paid,.no one else has anything
to say. The act of May 31, 1900, cI 598, 31 Stat. 221, 245,
directed the Secretary of the Interior to pay a named Iowa
head chief five hundred dollars a year, during the remainder of his life, beginning with and including the fiscal
year 1900, in accordance with the terms of article 4 of
the treaty of 1842, but that is -not enough to establish
that he had been guilty of mistake in not making the same
payment before the time that he was ordered to begin.
The fifth and last claim is for a share in proceeds of land
ceded by the treaty of 1859. As to this the Court of Claims:
finds it impossible to ascertain what sum if any is due
or to whom it would be payable. We do not see how the
claim can be supported when the treaty itself provided
that to benefit by it members must rejoin the tribe, meaning the tribe in Kansas, within one year. It is suggested to
be sure that the forfeiture as it is called, was dependent
upon notice being given as agreed in article 7, and that
there is some evidence that notice was not given. The

condition however was an absolute condition precedent
to the acquisition, by persons not parties to the treaty, of
any rights, if rights they can be called, notice or no notice;
and furthermore if the question were open we should not
be prepared to find that there was a failure in that respect.
See United States v. Crusell, 14 Wall. 1; United States v.
Pugh, 99 U. S. 265. New York Indians v. United States,
170 U. S. 1, has no bearing. There the question was
whether grantees in fee simple by treaty had forfeited
their rights.
The plaintiffs contend that, as the act authorizing the
suit gave the Court of Claims full legal and equitable jurisdiction, the appeal opens the findings of fact for reconsideration, as was held in United States v. Old Settlers, 148
U. S. 427, 464, 465. That, however, was a suit in equity,
whereas the present case is more analogous to an action
at law, to recover a fund from parties to whom it was paid
under mistake of law or fact, or from the original contractor by whom the payment was made. We should hesitate to depart from the ordinary rule that we do not go
behind the findings of the Court of Claims, The Sisseton &
Wahpeton Indians, 208 U. S. 561, 566, if, in our view, the
question needed to be decided. It is true that the court
below stated a principle of evidence that, if it is to be
taken literally, cannot be sustained. It said that counsel could not bind the court to admit evidence not admissible by law, and partly on that ground seems to have
declined to consider ex parte affidavits which the counsel
for the Iowa and Oklahoma Indians agreed might be given
the effect of depositions. The counsel for the United
States refused to agree, and this was a further, and possibly adequate ground for the exclusion, as the agreement
may have been understood to be conditional upon all parties joining. But of course evidence, hearsay or ex parte,
for instance, may be admitted by consent, unless perhaps
as against the United States, and then should be given

Opinion of the Court.

whatever weight it would have but for technical rules.
Apart from agreement the depositions were not made
evidence by the statute of 1907, as that only dealt with
reports of Departments, not with every exhibit that such
reports might contain.
The question remains whether the error, if error there
was, did the plaintiffs any harm. The counsel for the
plaintiffs treats the statute giving jurisdiction as intended
to open the case from the beginning without regard to
inconsistent statutes and to provide for an arbitration on
the footing of what may seem fair. See United States v.
Old Settlers, 148 U. S. 427, 428, 429, 473. Phineas PamTo-Pee v. United States, 148 U. S. 691, 699. In view of
the subject-matter an uneasy doubt is natural whether
Congress did not mean rather more than it plainly said.
But the jurisdiction given is 'legal and equitable' and the
authority is to 'adjudicate as justice and equity shall require' claims for money alleged 'to be due to them as their
proportionate shares' of appropriations to fulfill treaty obligations, etc. The statute creates no new right beyond
excluding the effect of the lapse of time and, perhaps, the
defence of res judicata and satisfaction under the acts of
1895 and 1896; it makes no admission, but simply provides
for a trial on the merits. See Stewart v. United States, 206
U. S. 185, 194. A merely moral claim is not made the
foundation of a possible recovery. Something must be
shown that amounts to a right.
It is apparent from what we have said that no finding
as to the number of Indians in Iowa in particular years,
without more, could change the result to which the Court
of Claims and this court have come. The treaty contracts
on which the plaintiff's claims are founded gave rights
only to the tribe, not to the members. It was an accepted
and reasonable rule, especially in the days when Indians'
wars still were possible and troublesome, that payments
to the tribe should be made only at their reservation and

to persons present there. The acts of 1852 and 1867 did
not shift the treaty rights from the tribe to the members,
create new rights or enlarge old ones. The payments up
to 1884 had the sanction of statute. The act of 1884 no
more created individual rights than did the acts of 1852 arid
1867. It confined its benefits to "original Sacs and Foxes
now in Iowa," and made the Secretary of the Interior the
judge. There is no evidence to show that he was wrong
as to the number of original Sacs and Foxes who had been
in Iowa on July 4, 1884. Whether' the plaintiffs might get
an award in a free arbitration, irrespective of treaty and
statute, we cannot say, but in our opinion they hav~e failed
to establish such rights as can be recognized by this court.
The decision below was according to the long established
construction and practice of. the .Department, a fact entitled to much weight in a case like this.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA, dissenting.

1. On the supposition that the findings of the Court of
Claims are binding on this court, the case should be remanded to that court for further consideration because of
its error in refusing to consider evidence made competent
by the jurisdictional act and by the stipulation between
the contending Indians.
2. If this court may go behind the findings, as I think
it may on the authority of United States v. Old Settlers,
148 U. S. 464, and as it is conceded by the contending Indians that it may, in my opinion the Secretary of the Interior, in apportioning the annuities from 1885 to date,
committed error in taking the fixed, unvarying sum of 317
for the Sacs and Foxes in Iowa, and 505 for those in Oklahoma, disregarding any increase or decrease of the reSpective divisions of the tribe. The tribal rights of the claimant Indians had been recognized, and the jurisdictional

act required that they should be given "their proportionate
shares according to their numbers . . . of the appropriations made by Congress for fulfilling treaty stipulations with the confederated tribes.
I think, therefore, that a fixed, unvarying sum should
not have been selected. Annual tests should have been
made and the increase or decrease of the Indians ascertained by the Secretary of the Interior.
The Court of Claims found, it is true, that there was no
competent evidence of the increase or decrease of the divisions of the tribe. But in so finding the court disregarded,
as I have already said, evidence which the jurisdictional
act and the stipulations of the contending Indians made
competent, and such evidence, though not strong, established that the claimant Indians had increased. It is
pointed out in the opinion that the Secretary of the In
terior recognized a small increase of the deferidant Indians in 1887.

Submitted March 10, 1911.-Decided April 24, 1911.

This court may not draw an inference of bad faith on the part of a
government inspector unless the findings are so clear on the-subject
as to take the inference beyond controversy.
It is the duty of the Court of Claims in dealing with the question of
bad faith on the part of a government inspector to explicitly find

the facts in regard to that subject.
The Court of Claims should find as a fact whether or not complaints
were made to the proper officers as to improper conduct on the part
of subordinates, and if made, when and what action was taken
thereon.
