A street must be properly paved, for the safety and convenience of travelers, as well as for the good of abutting

pavement has become necessary, and assessing the cost
according to an estimate of benefits, is not to be undone
because the railway is of the opinion that for the operation of its business the old pavement is good enough.

UNITED STATES v. ARIZONA.
No. 18, original.

Argued March 4, 1935.--Decided April 29, 1935.

1. Assuming that the stretch of the Colorado River between Arizona

and California involved in this case is navigable, Arizona owns
the part of the bed that is east of the thread of the stream; and
her jurisdiction in respect of the appropriation, use and distribution of an equitable share of the waters flowing therein is unaffected
by the Colorado River Compact or the federal reclamation law. But
the title of the State is held subject to the power granted to Congress by the commerce clause, and under that clause Congress has
power to cause to be built a dam across the river in aid of navigation. P. 183.
2. Section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899, forbidding the construction
of any dam in any navigable river of the United States until the
consent of Congress shall have been obtained, and until the plans
shall have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War, applies not only to acts of private persons but also to the acts of government officers. P. 183.
3. There is no presumption that regulatory and disciplinary statutes
kdo not extend to government officers. P. 184.

4. The authority given by § 25. of the Act of April 21, 1904, to the
Secretary of the Interior to divert waters of the Colorado River
for the purpose of providing irrigation for irrigable lands in
the Yuma and Colorado River Indian Reservations in Colorado
and Arizona, is not the "consent of Congress'! required by § 9 of
the Act of March 3, 1899, to legalize the construction of a dam
across that river where navigable. P. 184.
5. The clause of § 1 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act empowering
the Secretary to construct a main canal connecting the Laguna
Dam "or other suitable diversion dam" with the Imperial and
Coachella Valleys does not authorize the building of or in any
respect apply to the proposed dam here in question. P.-186.
6. Under § 4 of the Act of June 25, 1910, no irrigation project contemplated by the Reclamation Act "shall be begun unless and
until the same shall have been recommended by the Secretary of
the Interior and approved by the direct order of the President
of the United States." Held that executive action under the
National Industrial Recovery Act relied on by the Government
in this case to sustain the right to construct the dam in question, was not approval by direct order of the President. P. 187.
7. The National Industrial Recovery Act did not repeal the requirement of § 4 of the Act of June 25, 1910. P. 188.
8. Section 202 of the National Industrial Recovery Act, directing the
inclusion of river and harbor improvements in programs of public
works prepared by the Administrator under the direction of the
President, but with the proviso that no such improvements shall be
"carried out unless they shall have heretofore or hereafter been
adopted by the Congress or are recommended by the Chief of Engineers," must be read in harmony with the settled policy of Congress
established by the Rivers and Harbors Acts; and, when so read,
the proviso requires that the recommendation of the Chief. of
Engineers be based, on examinations, surveys and reports made in
pursuance of those Acts and submitted to the Congress. P. 188.
9. The Recovery Act does not require that such recommendations of
the Chief of Engineers be made to the Administrator instead of to
Congress nor empower the Administrator to initiate the preliminary
examinations, etc. P. 192.
10. The United States is without equity to enjoin a State from forcibly preventihg the erection on her territory of a dam in navigable
waters which has not been authorized by Congress., P. 192.

Argument for the United States.

295 U. S.

ORIGINAL surr by the United States to enjoin the State
of Arizona from inte-fering with the construction by the
Government of a dam across the Colorado River. The
hearing was upon plaintiff's motion for a preliminary
injunction and defendant's motion to dismiss the bill.

Assistant Attorney General Blair, with whom Solicitor
General Biggs and Mr. David B. Hempstead were on the
brief, for the United States.
The United States has constitutional power to construct
the dam in aid of navigation and flood control.
The United States has constitutional power to construct
the dam for the reclamation of the Colorado River Indian
Reservation and public lands. Shively v. Bowlby, 152
U. S. 1,47; McGilvra v. Ross, 215 U. S. 70; Winters v.
United States, 207 U. S. 564; United States v. Winans,
198 U. S. 371. For cases in the lower courts following the
Winters case, see Conrad Inv. Co. v. United States, 161
Fed. 829; United States v. Morrison,203 Fed. 364, 365.
The project for irrigating the -Colorado River Indian
Reservation had been definitely initiated prior to the
statehood of Arizona, beginning in 1865, and continued by
the appropriation of many thousands of dollars, as shown
by the appropriation acts. The diversion of water (and'
inferentially, the construction of diversion works) was
specifically authorized by the Act of April 21, 1904 (c.
1402, 33 Stat. 189, 224), which authorized the Secretary
of the Interior to divert the waters of the Colorado River
and to reclaim, utilize, and dispose of any land in the
Colorado RiverI Indian Reservation which might be made
irrigable by works constructed under the Reclamation
Act.
As to the Reservation, therefore, the preexisting power
to construct reclamation works would clearly not have
been curtailed by admission of Arizona to the Union,
whether or not the State consented to the continuance of

UNITED STATES v. ARIZONA.

Argument for the United States.

those powers. But the State did affirmatively consent,
in a form which, to quote United States v. Winans, 198
U. S. 371, 384, "fixes in the land such easemerits as enable the rights to be exercised."
The federal authority to construct reclamation works
for public lands is to be distinguished from the power to
regulate the use of water. Arizona v. California, 283
U. S. 423. The United States is certainly free of the
police regulations of a State in exercising the first function (United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co.,
174 U. S. 690, 703), which is all that is involved in the
controversy in its present stage.
If the consent of Arizona were otherwise necessary for
the construction of Parker Dam in aid of reclamation of
Indian and public lands, that consent has been irrevocably
given. Enabling Act, June 20, 1910, § 20, par. 7; Const.,
Arizona, Art. XX. .The stipulation was for the protection
of the right of use and development of federal property.
If so,, it was a valid provision.
The Secretary of the Interior has adequate statutory,
authority for the construction of the dam, and the contract of February 10, 1933, with the Metropolitan Water
District is a valid exercise of that authority. Act of
April 21, 1904, c. 1402, § 25, 33 Stat. 189, 224.
The"statutory authority for the erection of works in a
navigable river by an officer of the United States need
not be specific, and is not invalid because-it leaves to his
discretion how and where the works shall be built. This
was so in the case of the Boulder Canyon Project Act.
If the use of Parker Dam site,' and the generation of
power there for pumping water to the Colorado River
Indian Reservation, is, in the Secretary's opinion, the most
feasible way to carry, out the "diversion of -Water" authorized by the 1904 statute, it is immaterial that the site
itself is not withiUthe limits of the reservation.

The Secretary had authority to finance construction by
means of the contract of February 10, 1933, with the
Metropolitan Water District.
Mr. James R. Moore, Special Assistant Attorney
General of Arizona, with whom Mr. John L. Sullivan,
Attorney General, and Mr. Herman Lewkowitz were on
the brief, for Arizona.
Arizona owns in its sovereign capacity the east half of
the bed of the Colorado River.
Concurrent consent of Congress and the State is a prerequisite to construction of a dam. Pigeon River Improvement S. & B. Co. v. Cox, 291 U. S. 138, 159; Southlands Co. v. San Diego, 211 Cal. 646.
The Administrator of Public Works (the Secretary of
the Interior) is without authority to build the dam in
the absence of a showing of prior approval of Congress.
Wisconsin v. Illinois, 278 U. S. 399.
The United States has no constitutional authority to
construct the dam for reclamation, of public and Indian
lands, wifhout the consent of Arizona.
The United States, in the reclamation of public lands,
acts in its proprietary capacity.
The United States can assert no rights under paragraph 7 of § 20 of the Act admitting Arizona as a State.
Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 572; United States v. Utah,
283 U. S. 63, 75.
It clearly "appears from the reading of the bill that the
Metrdpolitan Water District of Southern California is
the real party in interest.
The Secretary of the Interior has no authority to bind
the, United States in the exercise. of its governmental
functions.
Approval of construction 'of the dam by the Chief of
Engineers and the Secretary of War is not the equivalent
to consent of Congress. Cobb v. Lincoln Park, 202, Ill.

UNITED STATES v. ARIZONA.
174

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
September 10, 1934, the United States, acting through
Harold L. Ickes, Secretary of the Interior and Federal
Emergency Administrator of Public Works, c&used to be
commenced the construction of the Parker Dam in the
main stream of the Colorado River, the- thread of which
for a distance of about 237 miles is the boundary between
Arizona and California. The site is 150 miles below the
Boulder Dam, half a mile below the place where the
Williams River flows into the Colorado, and 10 miles north
of the Colorado River Indian Reservation. Its ends rest
on public lands of the United States in Arizona and California. Arizona objects to the construction of the dam,
asserts that it may not lawfully be built without her consent, and threatens the use of military force to stop the
work. January 14, 1935, the United States filed its bill
in equity perpetually to enjoin interference by the State.
On plaintiff's motion this court directed defendant to show
cause why a restraining order should not issue pending the
final determination of the suit. Arizona filed a return
consisting of an affidavit of the Governor setting forth
the grounds on which the State claims the right to prevent
the construction of the dam in the part of the river bed
that is easterly of the thread of the stream, a motion to
dismiss the bill, and a supporting brief. We heard counsel
o4 plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction and
defendant's motion to dismiss.
We come first to the question whether the complaint
alleges facts sufficient to warrant an injunction against the
State. The allegations will be better understood after
brief reference to the Colorado River Compact 1 and ,the
Boulder Canyon Project Act, 45 Stat. 1057.
The Compact was made by California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Arizona was

not a party. It was made to provide an equitable apportionment of the waters of the Colorado River system
among the interested States, establish relative importance
of different beneficial uses and secure the development of

the Colorado River basin, the storage of its waters and
pr6tdction against floods.

After apportionment between

defined basins lying above and below Lee Ferry and a
declaration that the Colorado has ceased to be navigable
for commerce and that the Rse of its waters for purposes
of navigation should be subservient to uses for domestic,
agricultural and power purposes, the Compact authorizes
the waters of the system to be impounded and used for
the generation of-power and declares that use subservient
to uses for agricultural and domestic purposes. It was
approved by § 13 (a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act
and, by presidential proclamation, .it took effect June 25,
1929. 46 Stat. 3000. The Act authorizes the Secretary
of the Interior to construct a dam and incidental works
in. the Colorado at Boulder Canyon adequate to create a
reservoir having a capacity of not less than 20,000,000 acre
feet "and a main canal and appurtenant structures located
entirely within the United States connecting the Laguna
Dam, or other suitable diversion dam, which the Secretary . . . is hereby authorized to construct if deemed

necessary or, advisable by him upon engineering or economic" considerations, with- theJmperial and Coachella
Valleys in California2' § 1.2 In a suit in this Court
against the Secretary of the Interior and the States which
were parties, Arizona unsuccessfully sought to have ratification of the Compact decreed to be unconstitutional and
to enjoin construction of the Boulder Dam and the doing

of anything under color of that Act. Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423.
The bill alleges that February 10, 1933, the United
States, acting through the Secretary of the Interior, entered into a contract with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The District agrees to pay
to the United States the entire cost of the dam, assumed
not to exceed $13,000,000. By the use of this money the
United States agrees that, under the Reclamation Act,
June 17, 1902. 32 Stat. 388, and supplemental Acts, particularly those of April 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 224, March 4,
1921, 41 Stat. 1404, and December 21, 1928 (The Boulder
Canyon Project Act)3 it will construct the Parker Dam.
The District is to have one-half the power privilege and
the right to divert specified quantities of water. The
United States is to have the right to the rest of the power,
to divert water, to transmit power at cost over the District's lines from Boulder to Parker, and, by means of
canals, to coniect Parker Dam with lands in the Colorado
River Indian Reservation in Arizona and with other lands
in that State and in California.
Parker Dam will intercept waters discharged at Boulder
Dam and the inflow of tributaries of the Colorado below
that dam; raise the river level 72 feet and create a reservoir about 20 miles long, having capacity of 717,000 acre
feet, and permit generation of approximately 85,000 horsepower of electricity. Operated with Boulder Dam, it will

'reregulate and equate, in aid of navigation and river reg.
ulation," the waters discharged at Boulder Dam for flood
control, power generation and irrigation; allow, for generation of power, the discharge at Boulder Dam of water
which otherwise would have to be retained there in storage
and also conserve the waters there discharged.
The bill also alleges that heavy flash floods of the Williams River are a menace to the Colorado River Indian
Reservation, to United States public lands and to navigation below Parker. The dam is designed to promote
reclamation of the reservation lands and of public lands
of the United States. The power privilege reserved by
the United States is for the purpose of pumping water for
irrigation of these lands.
To disclose grounds on which the United States claims
the right to construct the dam, the bill sets out that at
various times Congress has made appropriations amounting in all to more than $1,359,000 for construction of
irrigation and diversion works for the reservation; 4 that
the above mentioned Act of April 21, 1904, authorized the
Secretary of the Interior to divert the waters of the Colo'Act of March 2, .1867, 14 Stat. 514, appr6priated $50,000 "For
expense of collecting and locating the Colorado River Indians in Arizona, on a reservation set apart for them by"' § 1, Act of March 3,
1865, 13 Stat. 559, "including the expense of constructing a canal for
irrigating said reservation." For completing the canal, $50,000 was
appropriated by the Act of July 27, 1868, 15 Stat. 222, and $20,000 by
the Act of May 29, 1872, 17 Stat. 188.
Section 3, Act of April 4, 1910, 36 Stat. 273, appropriated $50,000
"For the constructon of a pumping plant to be used for irrigation
purposes on the Colorado River Reservation, together with the necessary canals and laterals, for the utilization of water in connection
therewith, for the purpose of securing an appropriation of water for
the irrigation of approximately one hundred and fifty thousand acres
of land .. .to be reimbursed from the sale of the surplus lands of
the reservation." To complete and maintain the work commenced
by the 1910 Act, Congress has since appropriated $888,710.

rado and to reclaim, utilize and dispose of land in the reservatiQn which might be made irrigable by works constructed
under the Reclamation Act, and that the Boulder Canyon
Project Act appropriated moneys for surveys of the
Parker-Gila reclamation project, which, it is said, embracesthe Indian reservation and certain public lands of
the United States. And it is asserted that the Parker
Dam project has been included by the Administrator in
the comprehensive program of public works authorized by
§ 202, National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 201;
that, pursuant to that Act, the Chief of Engineers of the
United States Army has recommended the construction
and his recommendation has received the approval of the
Secretary of War.
1. The bill alleges that the stretch of the Colorado between Arizonk and California is navigable, and the motioh
to dismiss is dealt with on that basis. Arizona owns the
part of the river bed that is east of the thread of the
stream. New Jersey v. Delaware, 291 U. S. 361, 379 et
seq. Her jurisdiction in respect of the appropriation, use
and distribution of an equitable share of the waters flowing therein is unaffected by the Compact or federal reclamation law. But the title of the State is held subject
to the power granted to Congress by the commerce clause,
United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U. S. 49, 54--55,
and under that clause Congress has power to cause to be
built a dam across the river in aid of navigation. The
Boulder Canyon Project Act is an example of the exertion
of that power. Arizona v. California,supra,451, 455-457.
But no Act of Congress specifically authorizes the construction of the Parker Dam. Subject to an exception
with which we have no concern, § 9 of the Act of March
3, 1899, forbids the construction of any bridge, dam, dike
or causeway over or in any port, roadstead, haven, harbor,
canal, .navigable river or other navigable water of the
United States until the consent of Congress shall have

been obtained and until the plans shall have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and by
the Secretary of War. 33 U. S.C., § 401. And § 12-makes
violations of § 9 punishable by fine or imprisonment or
both and provides for the removal of unauthorized strutctures." '33 U. S. C., § 406. These provisions unmistakably'
disclose" definite intention on the part of Congress effectively to safeguard rivers and other navigable waters
against the unauthorized erection therein of dams or other
structures for any purpose whatsoever. The plaintiff
maintains that the restrictions so imposed apply only to
work undertaken by private parties. But no such intention is expressed, and we are of opinion that none is
implied. The measures adopted for the enforcement of
the prescribed rule are in general terms and purport to be
applicable to all. No valid reason has been or can be
suggested why they should apply to private persons and
not to federal and state officers. There is no presumption that regulatory and disciplinary measures do not
extend to such officers. Taken at face value the language
indicates the purpose of Congress to govern conduct of
its own officers and employees as well as that of others.
Donnelley v. United States, 276 U. S. 505, 516. If still
in force, § 9 unquestionably makes "consent of Congress"
essential to the valid authorization of the Parker Dam.
There has been no express repeal of that section and,
as will presently appear, it is not inconsistent with subsequent legislation on which plaintiff relies.
2. Plaintiff, unable to cite any statute specifically authorizing the Secretary to construct the dam, turns to § 25
of the Act of April 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 224. That section
is a part of the reclamation laws which are enacted-not
under the*commerce clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, but in the
exertion of power granted by. Art. IV, § 3, ci. 2: "The
Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all

UNITED STATES v. ARIZONA.

Opinion of the Court.

needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory
or other Property, belonging to the United States."
United States v. Hanson, 167 Fed. 881, 883. Kansas v.
Colorado,206 U. S. 46, 88, et seq. The part of § 25 relied
on follows; "That in carrying out any irrigation enterprise which may be undertaken under the provisions of
the reclamation Act ... and which may make possible
and provide for, in connection with the reclamation: of
other lands, the reclamation of all or any portion of the
irrigable lands on the Yuma and Colorado River Indian
Reservations in California and Arizona, the Secretary of
the Interior is hereby authorized to divert the waters of
the Colorado River and to reclaim, utilize, and dispose of
any lands in said reservations which may be irrigable by
such works in like manner as though the same were a part
of the public domain." The immediate question is
whether the italicized clause can reasonably be construed
as adequate to carry the burden that plaintiff would have
us lay upon it. The purpose was not to prescribe or
regulate the means to be employed to divert water from
the Colorado but to extend the reclamation law to the
Indian reservations named. It was merely to empower
the Secretary, if the circumstances stated should arise, to
reclaim lands in these reservations by use of water to be
taken from that river. The authority granted was no
more than permission to appropriate them for the purpose
specified. No dam is shown to have been- necessary.
Water is frequently taken from streams for the purposes
of irrigation without putting dams across them. Failure
specifically to authorize a dam or even approximately to
fix location or to require use calculated to aid navigation
makes strongly against the plaintiff.
In support of the construction for which it contends,
plaintiff asserts that it was under this Act that the Secretary of the Interior built the Laguna Dam across the

Colorado. But it does not appear that either riparian
State objected or that the validity of his authority has
ever been drawn in question. Congress has made appropriations for the benefit of the project of which it is a
part 5 and so recognized and approved the building of the
dam.' -Wisconsinv. Duluth, 96 U. S. 379, 386. There has
been cited no other instance of the construction, without
the consent of the Congress, of a dam across a navigable
interstate river. Indeed, it is not cettain that that part
of the Colorado was then deemed to be navigable.8 We
find no merit in the contention that § 25 of the Act of
April 21, 1904, is the "consent of Congress" required by
§ 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899. And plainly without
force is the suggestion that by making appropriations for
irrigation of lands in Indian reservations Congress authorized'this dam.
3 The clause of § 1 of -the Boulder Canyon Project
Act empowering the Secretary to construct a main canal
connecting the Laguna Da "or other suitable diversion
dam" with the Imperial and Coachella Valleys does not
authorize the building or in any respect apply to the
proposed Parker Dam. The latter is about 70 miles upstream from the Laguna and the canal proposed to be
built to bring water to the valleys named." The contract
alleged to have been made by the United States and thc
Metropolitan Water District, a copy of which is attached
to plaintiff's brief, shows that the purpose immediately
to be served * the Parker Dam is to enable the United

States in fulfillment of earlier contracts to deliver waters
-at that place into the aqueduct of the District. And
while that instrument specifies other uses to which the

United States may put the waters by means of the dam,
transmission by canal to either of these valleys is not
mentioned. Indeed, the plaintiff does not, and it, could
not reasonably, claim that, § 1 of the Boulder Canyon
Project Act authorizes the construction of this dam. Nor
does it make any contention in respect of the allegation
of the bill that § 11 of the Act authorizes surveys of the
Parker-Gila reclamation project.
4. Parker Dam was not approved by the President as
required by § 4 of the Act of June 25, 1910, 43 U. S. C.,
§ 413. That section declares that no irrigation project contemplated by the Reclamation-Act " shall be begun unless
and until the same shall have been recommended by the
Secretary of the Interior and approved by the direct order
of the President of the United States.", The project in
question rightly may be deemed to have been begun oh the
date, February 10, 1933, of the contract made by the
United States and the Water District for the construction
of the dam. There is no allegation that any project including the dam was ever recommended, submitted to or
in any manner approved by the President. But plaintiff
maintains that the approval required in the section has
been given through executive action under the National
Industrial Recovery Act. It relies on §§ 201 a, 202 and
203 of 'the Act and Executive Order No. 6252. The first
of these authorizes the President to ddlegate any of his
powers under Title II of the Act to such agents as he may
designate. Section 202 provides that the Administrator
under the direction of the President shall prepare a comprehensive program of public works "which shall include

construction of river and harbor improve-

ments .
Provided, That no river or harbor improvements shall be carried out unless they shall have heretofore

or hereafter been adopted by the Congress or are recommended by the Chief of tngineers . . ." Section 203 authorizes the President "through the Administrator ...
to construct . . . any public-works project included in the
program prepared pursuant to section 202." The Executive Order delegates authority to the Administrator "to
construct . . .any public-works project included in the
program." The contract here involved was made more
than four months before the passage of that Act. -Plaintiff
asserts that the project was included in the comprehensive
progiam, that the Administrator commenced construction
about September 10, 1934, and that on November 10 following, Arizona interfered forcibly to prevent plaintiff
from doing the work. The alleged recommendation by the
Chief of Engineers and approval by the Secretary of War
were not made until January 5, 1935,8 nine days before
plaintiff filed its bill. These facts do not constitute approval "by direct order of the President" as required by
§ 4. Plaintiff does not allege or claim that the President
has directly authorized the dam or specifically empowered
the Administrator to include it in the comprehensive program. We find nothing in the Recovery Act that reasonably may be held to repeal the requirement of that section.
It follows that the construction of the dam has not been
authorized as required
by the Reclamation Law.
5. Plaintiff's contention that the dam is being built
'under authority of the Recovery Act is without force.
The chronology just given, when taken in connection
with the citations in the contract of the Acts relied on,
shows the claim to be an afterthought born of the contro3

The complaint does not show the date of the alleged inclusion of
the dam in the comprehensive program of public works authorized
by § 202 of the Recovery Act. It also fails to give the date of the
recommendation of the Chief of Engineers and appoval by the Secretary of War. A copy of the certificate attached to the complaint
furnishes that date, January 5, 1935.

"versydisclosed by the complaint and about to be here submitted. Section 25 of the Act of April 21, 1904, does not
authorize this dam. Plaintiff does not assert that it was
otherwise adopted by Congress. It therefore remains only
to consider whether the dam was recommended by the
Chief of Engineers within the meaning of the proviso of
§ 202. When the Recovery Act was passed, the phrases
"adopted by the Congress " and "recommended by the
Chief of Engineers," when used in Acts of Congress relating to river and harbor improvements, .had well-understood and definite technical meanings. The statutes, at
least in the 40 years next preceding the passage of the
Recovery Act, disclose: It has been the general, if not indeed the uniform, practice of Congress specifically to
authorize all river and harbor improvements carried out
by the United States,9 and to base its action upon the
recommendation of the Chief of Engineers?0 That officer
'The Rivers and Harbors Acts prior to that of September 22, 1922,.
authorized surveys and improvements and made appropriations. A
typical provision was: "That the following sums . . . are hereby appropriated . . . to 'be expended under the direction of, the Secretary
of War and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers, for the construction, completion, repair, and preservation of the public works
hereinafter named... ." Act of August 8, 1917, 40 Stat. 250. ThE
Act of September 22, 1922, omitted appropriations and adopted specified improvements: "That the following works of improvement arE
hereby adopted and authorized, to be prosecuted under the direction
of the Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers in
accordance with the plans recommended in the roports hereinaftei
designated ... ." 42 Stat. 1038. The same lariguage is used in § 1
of the Acts of March 3, 1925, 43 Stat. 1186; January 21, 1927, 44
Stat. 1010, and July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 918. See also 79 Cong. Re.

makes such recommendation only after preliminary examinations followed by surveys. 1 Congress expressly directs
the making of these examinations and surveys ' and prohibits any which it has not authorized. 3
considering bill for river and harbor improvements, 79 Cong. Rec.,
p. 5441, see also pp. 5460, 5465, 5466. Cf. § 9, Act of September 22,
1922 (33 U. S. C., § 568): "No project shall be considered by any
committee of Congress with a view to its adoption, except with a
view to a survey, if five years have elapsed since a report upon a
survey of such project has been submitted to Congress pursuant to
law."
' To secure greater uniformity in the recommendations and reports required of Chief of Engineers (See H. Rep. No. 795, 57th
Cong., 1st session, p. 3), Congress created in his office a Board of
Engineers for Rivers and Harbors, § 3, Act of June 13, 1902, 32 Stat.
372. Subsequent legislation in respect of this Board, material here,
is found in § 3, Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 668; §§ 3 and 4, Act
of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 825; § 2, June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. 1010; § 9,
September 22, 1922, 42 Stat. 1043. 33 U. S. C., §§ 541, b42, 545, 546,
547, 568.
Preliminary examinations are first made, unless Congress expiessly
directs a survey and estimate, and if, upon such examination, the improvement is not thought advisable, no further action may be taken
unless Congress so directs. 33 U. S. C., § 545. The suksequent detailed survey report is made by the district engineer, it is reviewed
by the division engineer, by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and
Harbors and finally by the Chief of Engineers who submits to Congress a report containing information of a character specified by the
above statutes, together with his recommendation. As shown in
footnote 10, a congressional committee may not consider a project
with a view to its adoption if five years have elapsed since submission
of a report on a survey. See 79 Cong. Rec., p. 5439, et seq. 1922
Report of Chief of Engineers, pp. 99, 100.
'Since September 22, 1922, the Acts. authorizing preliminary examinations and surveys employ the following language: "The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to cause preliminary
examinations and surveys to be made at the following-named localities .....
§ 12, 42 Stat. 1043.
"'That no preliminary examination, survey, project, or estimate
for new works other than those designated in this or some prior Act

Opinion of the Court.

"As a general rule, where.the legislation dealing with a
particular subject consists of a system of related general
provisions indicative of a settled policy, new enactments
of a fragmentary nature on that subject are to- be taken
as intended to fit'into the existing system and to be carried
into effect conformably to it, excepting as a different
purpose is clearly shown." United States v. Jefferson
Electric Co., 291 U. S. 386, 396. In the light of that
rule it is clear the general language of the Recovery Act
on which plaintiff relies does not evidence intention on
the part of Congress to change its well established policy.
In respect of the required recommendation by the Chief
"ofEngineers there is no inconsistency between the proviso
and the statutes upon which rests the practice of his office.
The Recovery Act may, and therefore it must, be read in
harmony with the purposes evidenced by the provisions
of the Rivers and Harbors Acts to which reference has
been made. When so read the proviso requires that the
recommendation of the Chief of Engineers be based on
examinations, surveys and reports made in pursuance of
these Acts and submitted to the Congress for its consideration when determining whether the project should be
undertaken. The only change effected by the Recovery
Act is that the improvement may be made if either
"adopted by the Congress" or "recommended by the Chief
of Engineers" whereas the prior practice required not only
recommendation by the Chief of Engineers but also adoption by Congress; that is, the Recovery Act amounts
merely to the adoption of projects that have been hereor joint resolution'shall be made." § 12, Act of September 22, 1922,
42 Stat. 1043. Typical language in the Acts appropriating for rivers
and harbors is: "That no funds shall be expended for any preliminary examination, survey, project, or estimate not authorized by law."
It is found, for example, in the Act of April 26, 1934, 48 Stat. 639640, -mlingappropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1935.

tofore or hereafter may be recommended to Congress by
the Chief of Engineers under the established practice. 1'
In accordance with defi-nite policy long pursued by it,

the Congress has committed to the Secretary of War and
Chief of Engineers all investigations, surveys and work
in aid of navigation. The Recovery-Act discloses no intention to require that the Chief of Engineers' recommendations in respect of proposed improvements shall
be made to the Administrator instead of to the Congress.
The provisions of the Act brought forward by plaintiff
make no such change. Plainly they are not sufficient to
empower the Administrator to initiate preliminary examinations and surveys or to determine whether the Parker
Dam or any work in aid of navigation shall be undertaken.
It is not shown that Congress ever directed a 'preliminary examination or survey by the Chief of Engineers
of any project that includes this dam. This is a condition
precedent to the recommendation required by the proviso.
Failure to allege compliance warrants the conclusion that
the recommendation relied upon lacks the support of examination and survey by army officers and review
by the
board of engineer officers required by law.
6. As the complaint fails to show that the construction
of the dam is authorized, thereis no ground for the granting of an injunction against the State, and therefore the
complaint must be
Dismissed.

'When the Recovery Act was enacted, Congress had before it the
report of the Chief of Engineers for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1932. This report disclosed (p. 3) that 954 projects authorized by
Congres's were in force, that active operations were in progress upon

had been transmitted to Congress during the past fiscal year (p. 6),
