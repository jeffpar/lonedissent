HARTLEY, EXECUTOR, v. COMMISSIONER OF
INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE -CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 602. Argued April 11, 12, 1935.-Decided April 29, 1935.
1. Under the Revenue Acts of 1921 and 1924, the basis for computing
gain or loss on the sale of property of an estate, and its depletion
or depreciation, for the purposes of taxing income returnable by
an executor, is its value at the decedent's death, rather than its
cost to the decedefit or its value on March 1, 1913, if acquired
before that date. Pp. 217-218.
2. The reenactment, without material change, of the pertinent provisions of § 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921 was a congressional
recognition and approval of the interpretation of the section by
the treasury regulations, which gave them the force of law. P. 220.
3. The incorporation into § 113 (a) (5), Revenue Act of 1928, of the
substance of the Treasury Regulation prescribing that gains or
losses of an estate should be computed" on the basis of the value
of the property at the date of the decedent's death, was intended
to clarify the law, not to change it. Id.
72 F. (2d) 352, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 294 U. S. 700, to review the affirmance of
a deci1on of the Board of Tax Appeals, 27 B. T. A. 952,

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. H. C. Fulton, with whom Messrs. H. B. Fryberger
and E. L. Boyle were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. David E. Hudson, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, and Messrs.
James W. Morris and A. F. Prescott were on the brief,
for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 72 F.
(2d) 352, affirmed a ruling of the Board of Tax Appeals,
27 B. T. A. 952, and held that under § 202 of the Revenue
Act of 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 229, and § 204 of the
Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 258, the basis
for computing gain or loss on the sale of property, and
its depletion or depreciation, for purposes of taxing income returned by the petitioner, an executor, is its value
at the date of the decedent's death, rather than the cost
to the decedent, or the value on March 1, 1913, if acquired
before that date.
We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict of the decision below, and of the like decision, under § 202 of the
1918 Revenue Act, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, of the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Eldredge v. United
States, 31 F. (2d) 924, 930, with that of the Court of
Claims in McKinney v. United States, 62 Ct. Cls. 180.
See Elmhirst v. United States, 38 F. (2d) 915; Myers v.
Uhited States, 51 F. (2d) 145; compare McCann v.
United States, 48 F. (2d) 446, each- decided by the Court
of Claims.
Petitioner's tax returns' were for the calendar years
1924 and 1925. Sections 202 (a), (b) and 214 (a) (8), (10)
'As permitted by § 702 of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45

Stat. 791, 879, petitioner elected to have his tax determined "in
accordance with the law properly applicable," § 702 (b), rather than
"in accordance with the regulations in force at the -time such return
was filed," § 702 (a).

Opinion of the Court.

295 U. S.

of the 1921 Act, and § 204 (a), (b), (c) of the Revenue
Acts of 1924 and 1926, c. 77, 44 Stat. 9, provide that the
basis for computing gain or loss on the sale of property,
and depreciation and depletion, shall be its cost, or its
value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date.
None of the acts specifically provides a basis for making
the computations where return- is made of income received by the estate of a decedent in the course of administration. But in the case of property acquired by "bequest, devise, or inheritance" § 202 (a) (3) of the 1921
Act and § 204 (a) (5) of the. 1924 and 1926 Acts provide
that the basis shall be the fair market value "at the
time of acquisition."
The revenue acts consistently treat the estate of a
decedent in the hands of an administrator or executor as
a separate taxpayer. By § 2 of the 1921, 1924 and 1926
Acts the estate of a decedenf is embraced within the term
"taxpayer." Each Act specifically provides for taxation
of the income of an estate during administration. § 219
of- the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts. Each includes profits
from the sale of property by the taxpayer in taxable iicome, § 213 of the 1921, 1924 and 1926 Acts, and provides for the deduction of losses from gross income in
arriving at taxable income. § 214 of the 1921, 1924 and
1926 Acts. See Merchants Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, 255 U. S. 509, 516, 517. Each makes provision
for the imposition of a -tax upon the estates of deceased
nersons, and the "gross estate" which is the basis for computing the tax is the value of the decedent's property at
the time of his death. § 402, 1921 Act; § 302, 1924 and
1926 Acts.
The Court of Claims held that the time of acquisition,
indicated by § 202 (a) of the 1921 Act and § 204 (a) of
the 1924 and 1926 Acts as the controlling date for calculating gain or loss to the estate in the course of administration, must be taken to be the. date of acquisition

Opinion of the Court.

by the decedent rather than the time of acquisition by
the executor or administrator on the decedent's death.
This conclusion, it was thought, was compelled by the
statutory command that the basis of computation shall
be "cost," which could have no application to the acquisition by the executor or administrator, who is not a purchaser of the estate which he administers. McKinney v.
United States, supra, 188. But this specification is not
enough to restrict the effect of the general provisions of
these revenue acts which impose a tax on' the income, including capital gains, of taxpayers. The use of the word
cost does not preclude the computation and assessment
of the taxable gains on the basis of the value of property,
rather than its cost, where there is no purchase by the
taxpayer, and thus no cost at the controlling date. See
Heiner v. Tindle, 276 U. S. 582, 585, 586; Lucas v. Alexander, 279 U. S. 573, 578, 579.
No plausible reason has been advanced for supposing
that Congress intended the capital gains or losses of the
estate of a decedent to be treated any differently from
those resulting from the sale of property taken by "bequest, devise, or inheritance," as provided in § 202 (a) (3)
of the 1921 Act and § 204 (a) (5) of the 1924 and 1926
Acts, or that it intended to bring gains or losses, accruing
between the date of decedent's acquisition of the property
and his death, into the computation of both the estate tax
and the income tax assessed upon his administrator or
executor. When it had a different purpose in the case of
gifts inter vivos, not subject to a gift tax, it specifically
directed that gains or losses to the donee should be computed on the basis of the cost of the property at the date
of acquisition by the donor. § 202 (a) (2), 1921 Act;
§ 204 (a) (2) (4), 1924 and 1926 Acts; see Taft v. Bowers,
278 U. S. 470; Helvering v. New York Trust Co., 292 U. S.
.455, 462. The conclusion seems inescapable that the
intended date of acquisition by an executor or administra-

tor, where the estate is the taxpayer, is the date of the
decedent's death. Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 335.
Possibility of doubt was removed by treasury regulation.
Article 343 of Regulation 45, under the 1918 Act, prescribed that gains or losses of an estate should be computed
on the basis of the value of the property at the date of
the decedent's death. This was carried forward by Art.
343 of Reg. 62 under the Act of 1921, of Reg. 62 under
the Act of 1924, and of Reg. 69 under the Act of 1926. Following the decision of the Court of Claims in McKinney
v. United States, supra,and with the purpose of conforming to it, the ruling was amended by T. D. 4011, VI-1
Cum. Bul. 77, on April 6, 1927, so as to make the cost to
the decedent the basis of the computation. Doubts having
been raised as to the ruling in McKitney v. United States,
supra,by later decisions,2 the amendment was revoked and
Article 343 restored to its original form, T. D. 4177, VII-2
Cum. Bul. 134, on July 7, 1928. The substance of the
regulation in its original and final form was carried into
§ 113 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat.
791, 819, which directed that the basis for the computation
of gains or losses upon property-acquired by the decedent's
estate from the decedent should be its value at the time of
the decedent's death.
The reenactment of 'the pertinent provisions of § 202 of
the Revenue Act of 1921 in the Acts of 1924 and 1926,
without material change, was a congressional recognition
and approval of the interpretation of the section by the
treasury regulations, which gave them the force of law.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 574. Argued April 4, 1935.-Decided April 29, 1935.
Under the Longshoremen's & Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,
made applicable to the District 6f Columbia as a compensation law,
where several persons, as dependants or next of kin, aie entitled to
claim compensation under the Act, or damages under the District
of Columbia death statute, on account of the death of an employee
caused by the negligence of a stranger to the employment, an
election by one of them to take compensation under the Compensation Act does not operate to assign to the employer the cause of
action against the wrongdoer with the right to sue upon it in his
own name; but it subrogates the employer to the right that the
person so electing had to compel suit by the executor or administrator and to share in the recovery. Aetna Life Insurance Co. v.
