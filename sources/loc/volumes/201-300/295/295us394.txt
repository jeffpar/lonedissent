OCTOBER TERM, 1934.

Counsel for Parties.

295 U. S.

Harriet E. Cole, the purchaser at the receiver's sale,
has asked leave to intervene in this Court, but as she has
not acquired through her purchase the title to, or an interest in, the patent, she is not entitled to seek an injunction to restrain infringement. Crown Die & Tool Co. v.
Nye Tool Works, 261 U. S. 24, 38, 39; Boomer v. United
Power Press Co., 13 Blatch. 107, 112, 113; Kaiser v.
General PhonographSupply Co., 171 Fed. 432, 433. The
right to such an injunction underlies the equitable jurisdiction here invoked. Root v. Railway Co., 105 U. S. 189.
The motion for leave to intervene is denied.
By order of the state court, the receiver, as such, succeeded to the patent right and to the cause of action here
involved. But the receiver, while retaining the patent,
has disposed, with the approval of the state court, of his
entire interest in the present suit against respondent. As
the petitioner in these circumstances is not in a position
to maintain this suit, the Court is of the opinion that the
writ of certiorari should be,
Dismissed.

PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted in the District Court of Okmulgee County, Oklahoma, upon an information charging rape. At the trial, petitioner challenged the jury
panel upon the ground that negroes for a long period
had been excluded from jury service in that . county
solely on account of their race or color, and that this
discrimination had deprived petitioner of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Constitution of the
United States. Evidence was taken by the trial court
upon this issue, the challenge was overruled, and petitioner excepted. Upon. appeal, the federal question was
presented to the *Criminal Court of Appeals and was
decided against petitioner. This Court granted a writ of
certiorari, April 1, 1935.
From its examination of the evidence, the-Court is 'of
the opinion that the case calls for the application of the
principles declared in Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370,
397, and Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S.-587.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
for fuither proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
