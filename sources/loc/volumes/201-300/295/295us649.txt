If, when the blow from a swinging crane knocks a longshoreman from the dock into the water, the cause of action
arises on the land, it must follow, upon the same reasoning, that when he is struck upon the vessel and the blow
throws him upon the dock the cause of action arises on the
vessel. Compare Vancouver S. S. Co. v. Rice, 288 U. S.

MR. CHiEF JusTric. H >HES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
Petitioner was a passenger on the steamship "Admiral
Peoples" on her voyage from Wilmington, California,
to Pottland, Oregon. While disembarking at Portland
petitioner was injured by falling from a gangplank leading from the vessel to the dock. This libel in rem
against the vessel alleged that respondent placed the gangplank so that it sloped from the ship toward the dock at
an angle of from ten to fifteen degrees; that it was approximately two feet in width and eighteen feet in length
and was equipped with the usual rope railings which
terminated approximately three feet from each end; that
the level of the plank at the shore end was about six
inches above the level of the dock, thereby creating a step
from the plank to the dock; that upon instructions from
one of respondent's officers, libelant proceeded along the
plank and as she reached its lower end, being unaware of
the step and having no warning, she fell from the plank
and was "violently and forcibly thrown foriard upon the

dock in such manner as to cause the injuries hereinafter
set forth." Libelant alleged negligence in failing'to pro'vide a handrope or railing extending along eithdr side of
the gangplank to the shore end, in failing to have the
plank flush with the dock or taper off to the level of the
dock, and in failing to give.warning of the step.
Respondent's exception to the libel, upon the ground
that the case was not within the admiralty jurisdiction,
was sustained by the District Court, and its judgment dismissing the libel was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. In view of an asserted conflict with other decisions
of the federal courts,' we granted a writ of certiorari.
This is one of the border cases involving the close distinctions which from time to time are fecessary i-app'lying the principles governing the admiralty jurisdiction.
That jurisdiction in cass of tort depends upon the locality of the injury. It does not extend to injuries caused.
by a vessel to persons or property on the land. Where
the cause of action arises upon the land, the state law is
applicable. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, 33; Johnson v.

The basic fact in the instant case is that the gangplank
was a part of the vessel. It was a part of the vessel's
equipment which was placed hi position to enable its
passengers, to reach the shore. It was no less a part of
the vessel because in its extension to the dock it pro'Compare The Strabo, 90 Fed. 110, 98 Fed. 998; The H. S. Pickands, 42 Fed. 239; The Aurora, 163 Fed. 633, 178 Fed. 587; Aurora

jected over the land. Thus, while the libelant was on
the gangplank she had not yet left the vessel. This was
still true as she proceeded to the shore end of the plank.
If while on that part of the vessel she had been hit by a
swinging crane and had been precipitated upon the dock,
the admiralty would have had jurisdiction of her claim.
See Minnie v. PortHuron Terminal Co., decided this day,
ante, p. 647. If instead of being struck in this way, the
negligent handling of the vessel, as by a sudden movement, had caused her to fall from the gangplank, the cause
of action would still have arisen on the vessel. We perceive no basis for a sound distinction because her fall
was due to negligence in the construction or placing of
the gangplank. By reason of that neglect, as the libel
alleges, she fell from the plank and was violently thrown
forward upon the dock. Neither the short distance that
she fell nor the fact that she fell on the dock and not in
the water, alters the nature of the cause of action which
arose from the breach of duty owing to her while she was
still on the ship and using its facility for disembarking.
This view is supported by the weight of authority in
the federal courts. In The Strabo, 90 Fed. 110, 98 Fed.
998, libelant, who was working on a vessel lying at a dock,
attempted to leave the vessel by means of a ladder which,
by reason of the master's negligence, was not secured
properly to the ship's rail and in consequence -the ladder
fell and the libelant was thrown to the dock and injured.
The District Court, sustaining the admiralty jurisdiction, asked these pertinent questions (90 Fed. p. 113):
"If a passenger, standing-at the gangway, for the purpose
of alighting, were disturbed by some negligent act of the
master, would the jurisdiction of this court depend upon
the fact whether he fell on the dock, and -remained there,
or whether he was precipitated upon the dock in the first
instance, or finally landed there after first falling on some
part of the ship? If a seaman, by the master's neglect,

should fall overboard, would this court entertain jurisdiction if the seaman fell in the 'water, and decline jurisdiction if he fell on the dock or other land? The incegtion of a cause of action is not usually defined by such a
rule." The Circuit Court 6f Appeals of the Second Circuit, affirming the decision of thb District Court (98 Fed.
p. 1000), thought it would be a too literal and an inaLmissible interpretation of the language used in The Plymouth, supra, to say that "if a passenger on board a
steamship should, through the negligence, of the owners,
stumble on the ship upon a defective gangplank, and be
precipitated upon the wharf, the injury would not be a

outh decision," said the courti "and which was applicable
to the circumstances of that case, does not justify such a
conclusion." And, deciding the case before it, the Circuit Court of Appeals said: "The cause of action originated and the injury had commenced on the ship, the
consummation somewhere being inevitable. It is not of
vital importance to the admiralty jurisdiction whether
the injury culminated on the stringpiece of the wharf or
in the water." See, also, The Atna, 297 Fed-. 673, 675,
676; The Brand, 29 F. (2d) 792.
In L'Hote v. Crowell, 54 F. (2dk212, a longshoreman,
who had been working on a wharf in putting bales in a
sling which was raised by the ship's tackle and then
lowered into its hold, was riding on the last load when the
sling struck against the rail or side of the*ship, with the
result that he fell to the wharf and was injured. The
Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit said that
he had "finished his work on the wharf and from the time
he was lifted from it by the sling by means of the ship's
tackle was under the control of an instrumentality of the
ship "; and, in that view, the jurisdiction, of admiralty
was sustained. The ruling in that case was not disturbed
by our decision on certiorari (as the Circuit Court of Ap-

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 178. Argued December 6, 1934.--Decided June 3, 1935.
1. The right to trial by jury preserved by the Seventh Amendment is
the right which existed under the English common law when the
Amendment was adopted. P. 657.
2. The Amendment not only preserves that right but exhibits a
studied purpose to protect it from indirect impairment through
possible enlargements of the power of regxamination existing under
the common law, and to that end declares that "no fact tried by a
jury shall be otherwise regxamined in any court of the United
States than according to the-rules of the common law." P. 657.
3. The aim of the Amendment is to preserve the substance of the
common-law right of trial by jury, as distinguished from mere matters of form or procedure, and particularly to retain the commonlaw distinction between the province of the court and that of the
jury, whereby, in the absence of express or implied consent to the
contrary, issues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues of
fact are to be determined by the jury under appropriate instructions
by the court. P. 657.
