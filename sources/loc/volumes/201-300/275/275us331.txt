RICHMOND SCREW ANCHOR COMPANY v.
UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS

No. 99. Argued December 1, 1927.-Decided January 3, 1928.
1. Patent No. 1,228,120, issued May 29, 1917, to Lenke for a cargo
beam capable of moving on a horizontal axis so as to present its
full strength in the line of stress, thus permitting the use of less
metal than was required for the fixed beam of the prior art, and
saving expense in installation-held valid. P. 339.
2. Where two reasons are given in an opinion for the same decision,
neither is obiter dictum. P. 340.
3. Rev. Stat. § 3477, forbidding assignments of claims against the
United States prior to allowance, liquidation and issuance of a
warrant for payment, applied to claims for infringement of a.
patent. P. 340.
4. The right to recover for past infringement of a patent by a private
party is assignable with the patent. P. 344.
5. Under the Act of June 25, 1910, where a patented article was made
for the United States by a contractor, unauthorized by the patent
owner, and used by the United States, the patent owner had an
assignable right of action for the infringement against the contractor; and a claim against the United States for reasonable compensation for the use, assertable in the Court of Claims, but subject
to the provisions of Rev. Stats. § 3477 forbidding assignments.
Pp. 341, 344, 346.
6. Under the Act of July 1, 1918, which did away with the remedy
against the contractor in such cases, and confined the patent owner
to a suit against the United States in the Court of Claims for
" recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use
and manufacture," the claim of the patent owner against the

United States for manufacture and use occurring since the date of
the Act, is assignable with the patent, notwithstanding the sweeping terms of Rev. Stats. § 3477. P. 345.
7. Federal statutes should be so construed as to avoid serious doubt
of their constitutionality. P. 346.
8. The special intent to permit such assignments, deducible from the
later statute and its history, though not expressed, must prevail
over the broad general terms of the earlier one forbidding assignments. P. 346.

CERTIORARI, 273 U. S. 679, to a judgment of the Court
of Claims, rejecting a claim for infringement of a patent.
Mr. Charles E. Hughes, with whom Messrs. Wm. Houston Kenyon, Archibald Cox, 0. Ellery Edwards, Joseph
W. Cox, and Douglas H. Kenyon were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Use by the United States after March 7, 1921, when
petitioner's ownership of the patent began, was in itself
an infringement of the patent and, without more, supports the petition and entitles the petitioner to recovery
under the findings of fact made by the Court of Claims.

Act of 1910; Sperry v. Arma Engineering Co., 271 U. S.

Manufacture by the contractors for the United States
on January 1, 1919, prior to petitioner's ownership, was
an infringement by the contractors, the right to recover
for which was assignable with the patent under Rev.
Stats. § 4898, and the right to recover from the United
States the reasonable and entire compensation for that
infringement was given to the then owner of the patent
by the Act of 1918. This was assignable with the patent
under Rev. Stats. § 4898, and in spite of Rev. Stats.
§ 3477, and, without more, supports the petition and en-

titles petitioner to a recovery under the findings of fact
made by the Court of Claims. E. W. Bliss Co. v. United
States, 253 U. S. 187; Standard Oil Co. v. United States,
267 U. S. 76; Sperry Gyroscope Co. v. Arma Co., 271
U. S. 232.
To construe the Act of 1918 as relieving the contractors
from all liability to the then owner of the patent or to his
assignee, and substituting therefor a liability of the United
States to the then owner of the patent only and (under
Rev. Stats. § 3477) not to his assignee, would appear to
be taking private property for public use without due
process of law or just compensation, and certainly would
not give the owner of the patent an additional remedy, as
the Act of 1918 purports to do, but a substantially curtailed remedy. It is certainly not clear that the Act of
1918 intended this curtailment of remedy. A construction of the Act of 1918 in this regard which preserves all
the rights of the owner of the patent, rather than substantially curtails those rights and remedies, is clearly indicated and is enforced by familiar canons of construction.
While, in so far as concerns the contractors' infringing
acts, the suit is, by virtue of the Act of 1918, one against
the United States, the claim was not against it, but against
the contractors. The Act of 1918 changed the defendant
and the forum, but did not change the nature or the
incidents of the claim.
The history of the Act of 1918 shows the legislative
intent to relieve the contractor from all liability and from
all apprehension of liability, by substituting the liability
of the United States.
Why does the Act of 1918 exclude from its benefits the
assignee of any patentee who at the time he makes the
claim for past infringement by the United States is in
the service of the Government, if all assignees are excluded by Rev. Stats. § 3477?

334

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Petitioner.

275 U. S.

The Act names the defenses of which the United States
is permitted to avail itself, and they do not include Rev.
Stats. § 3477.
Rev. Stats. § 3477, is not applicable to any branch of the
claim against the United Stares for infringement prior to
March 7, 1921, for the assignability of that branch of the
claim is determined by the patent statutes, Rev. Stats.
§ 4898, as an incident of the assignability of the patent
itself.
The so-called decision in Brothers v. United States, 250
U. S. 88, was an obiter dictum, and we respectfully submit that it was error and we ask reconsideration. United
States v. Corbett, 215 U. S. 233; Grigsby v. Russell, 222
U. S. 149; Barnes v. Alexander, 232 U. S. 117.
Section 3477 refers to claims in the nature of a chose
in action at common law, and an assignment of Letters
Patent together with all claims for past infringements,
is not within its meaning. Crown Die & Tool Co. v.
Nye Tool Works, 261 U. S. 24; Gayler v. Wilder, 10 How.
477; Robinson on Patents, Vol. 3, p. 122, § 937; Gordon
v. Anthony, 16 Blatchf. 234.
Where a specific section of a law is in apparent conflict with a general section, the two should be considered
and the context considered and the probable legislative
intent, but presumably the specific should prevail over
the general. Townsend v. Little, 109 U. S. 504; Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422.
Under the findings of fact made by the Court of Claims,
the patent is valid, and is infringed, and the petitioner
is entitled to a substantial money recovery from the
United States, which shall cover and include the capital
saving realized by the contractors and the United States.

An additional' sum, equal to interest on the capital
saving of $103,480 from January 1, 1919, should be
included in the award to petitioner.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Galloway, with whom
Solicitor General Mitchell was on the brief, for the United
States.
So far as § 3477 is concerned, there is no reason to
distinguish as to the assignability of unliquidated claims
against the United States between those arising through
infringement by the United States and those based on
the assumption of liability by the United States for
infringement by others. United States v. Gillis, 95 U. S.
407; Spofford v. Kirk, 97 U. S. 484; Goodman v. Niblack,
102 U. S. 556; Seaboard Air Line v. United States, 256
U. S. 655; Price v. Forrest, 173 U. S. 410; Brothers v.
United States, 250 U. S. 88.
The findings show no basis for substantial recovery for
infringement occurring after petitioner acquired the
patent. If claims for infringement arising previously
were not lawfully assigned to petitioner, its recovery is
limited to infringements by the United States occurring
between March 7, 1921, and the date of the commencement of this suit, May 23, 1921, a period of little over two
months. The infringing manufacture of the beams for
the United States and their installation took place before
March 7, 1921. The value of the invention rests in the
substitution of a lighter beam for a heavier one, with a
resulting saving in metal. There is no finding that the
completed and installed device has any advantage over
the old type of rigid cargo beam.
The petitioner attempts to treat this saving in cost of
installation, or in the original cost of the equipment, as a

336

Argument for the United States.

275 U. S.

saving in cost of handling cargoes, but the saving took
place before any cargo was handled, and would have been
the same if the apparatus had been destroyed the day after
it was installed. It is settled, too, except where accountings for profits are involved (and the United States has
made no profit in that sense, and, not being subject to injunction, is not subject to recovery of profits, which is
only an incident to suit for injunction), that recovery for
infringement is measured by the plaintiff's loss, not by the
defendant's gain. Coupe v. Royer, 155 U. S. 565; Brown
v. Lanyon, 148 Fed. 838.
There is a finding that the fair license value on a royalty basis is the sum of $20 a cargo beam, amounting
in this case to $16,200, irrespective of the length of time
the completed apparatus is used; but if that be the measure of recovery, the cause of action for it arose when
the beams were installed, in favor of the then owner of
the patent, who is now entitled (his assignment being
void), unless he has lost his right for some other reason,
to recover such license fees from the United States. Because of § 3477, Rev. Stats., the situation is the same as
if the assignment of the patent had been made without
any assignment of claims for past infringement, and as
if the former and present owners of the patent were each
seeking to recover damages from the United States, and
the question was as to how the entire recovery from the
United States should be divided between them. It seems
obvious from the findings that if the use of the apparatus since its installation constitutes in any proper sense
a use of the invention, it is only technically so, and the
recovery for the period after March 7, 1921, and prior
to May 23, 1921, could only be nominal, the substantial
recovery for damages going to the one who owned the
patent when the beams were manufactured and installed.
Being open to such a claim in favor of the original owners of the patent should relieve the United States from

RICHMOND CO. v. UNITED STATES.

a liability for the same thing to the present owner of
the patent. See Seymour v. McCormick, 16 How. 480;
Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U. S. 64; Stutz v. Armstrong, 25
Fed. 147; Bloomer v. Millinger, 1 Wall. 340.
If the petitioner could in any event recover only
nominal damages for the period from March 7, 1921, to
May 23, 1921, that alone would afford no reason for
reversing the judgment below. Diamon v. Taylor, 99
Minn. 527.
MR.

CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a suit by the Anchor Company brought under
the Act of June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851, as amended
July 1, 1918, c. 114, 40 Stat. 704, 705, to recover for
the infringement of Letters Patent No. 1,228,120 for a
cargo beam, granted May 29, 1917, to Melchior Lenke, and
assigned by' Lenke to Thomas E. Chappell, and by Chappell to the Anchor Company.
The Court of Claims first decided that the plaintiff was
entitled to recover from the United States. Thereafter
the court made a second decision, on December 7, 1925, in
which it found as an additional fact that through the
contractors who manufactured for the United States, the
United States had installed, on or before January 1, 1919,
810 cargo beams covered by the Lenke patent, and that
it did not thereafter install any more; that the use of the
Lenke cargo beams by the United States resulted in a
saving in the expense of installation of cargo beams used
by it amounting in the case of each beam to 2,000 pounds
of metal, with a value of 61/2 cents per pound; that the
single advantage which the United States gained by the
use of the beams was the saving in cost of the same and
the convenience resulting from their novelty.
Upon the additional findings of fact, the Government
contended that the former judgment should be set aside,

275 U. S.

and a new one entered dismissing the plaintiff's petition,
for the reason that the assignment of the claims for infringement to the plaintiff was void and of no effect under
section 3477 of the Revised Statutes. The Court of
Claims on the second hearing yielded to this contention
and dismissed the petition.
A cargo beam is a beam employed in combination with
other elements to carry the weight of cargo to be removed
from the holds of vessels alongside a pier or wharf and
deposited on the pier or in the warehouses fronting on the
same. Such beams are old and have been used for years.
The method existing prior to this invention was the use of
two channel beams, spaced several inches apart, firmly
riveted together at the top and bottom by means of angle
irons or plates, and rigidly affixed at either end to two uprights extending upward through the roof of the warehouse in brackets designed for the purpose. The record
showed that a beam adaptable for the purpose weighed
3,300 pounds and must possess the full strength of withstanding the pull of cargo weights from both a vertical
and diagonal angle.
Lenke conceived the idea of substituting for the fixed
beam a single I beam of about 1,300 pounds in weight.
At each end of the I beam he attached laterally a strong
bar by means of rivets and angle irons providing holes
near its upper end, through which holes he introduced
pivots, thereby enabling the cargo beam to swing into
any angle from which the load was applied. Lenke fastened U bolts into the center or neutral zone of the beam
to receive the hoisting tackle. The real worth of the invention lay in the lightness of the cargo beam he used
because the operator could present it so as to make the
strain on the beam to be vertical even when force was
applied from an angle.
The patent was a combination patent, and in view
of the prior art was limited to. the exact terms of the

RICHMOND CO. v. UNITED STATES.
331

339

Opinion of the Court.

claims, which made it quite narrow, as its course through
the Patent Office clearly demonstrated.
It is argued, on behalf of the United States, that Lenke's
invention was unpatentable because it embodied nothing
more than a natural and normal modification of existing
ideas. Such modifications and their advantage were all
very clear after the fact; but the old beams had been in
use for a number of years and a heavy weight of metal had
been used when, by Lenke's device, it was cut down twothirds. Lenke's cargo beam almost universally superseded the old one. The United States used it and it was
installed in nearly every pier in the country. No one else
had foreseen its advantage. Lenke offered it as a solution
of the problem at a minimum cost with a maximum efficiency. The United States conceded in the Court of
Claims that Lenke's patent was novel in the sense that
there was nothing in the prior art exactly like it, and that
it was useful. While thus, in a way, he improved an
existing idea, he developed a new idea. The question of
its patentability was worked out in the Court of Claims
and all the judges concurred in upholding its validity and
did not change their conclusion in the second judgment.
We see no reason for differing from that conclusion.
The Court of Claims based its second judgment against
the plaintiff on the strength of section 3477 of the United
States Revised Statutes, as construed by this Court in
Brothers v. United States, 250 U. S.88, 89. The section
reads as follows:
"All transfers and assignments made of any claim upon
the United States, or of any part or share thereof, or interest therein, whether absolute or conditional, and whatever may be the consideration therefor, and all powers of
attorney, orders, or other authorities for receihing payment of any such claim, or of any part or share thereof,
shall be absolutely null and void, unless they are freely
made and executed in the presence of at least two attest-

ing witnesses, after the allowance of such a claim, the
ascertainment of the amount due, and the issuing of a
warrant for the payment thereof. Such transfers, assignments, and powers of attorney, must recite the warrant
for payment, and must be acknowledged by the person
making them, before an officer having authority to take
acknowledgments of deeds, and shall be certified by the
officer; and it must appear by the certificate that the
officer, at the time of the acknowledgment, read and fully
explained the transfer, assignment, or warrant of attorney
to the person acknowledging the same."
In the Brothers case, Mr. Justice Pitney said the claim
of Brothers for compensation for a patent he had secured
by assignment could not apply to an "unliquidated claim
against the Government arising prior to the time he became the owner of the patent. Rev. Stats., § 3477."
Counsel for the petitioner here insist that this statement
was not necessary to the decision because the conclusion
in that case was clearly made to depend on the noninfringement of the patent and that the reference to section 3477 could only be regarded as obiter dictum. It
does not make a reason given for a conclusion in a case
obiter dictum that it is only one of two reasons for the
same conclusion. It is true that in this case the other
reason was more dwelt upon and perhaps it was more
fully argued and considered than section 3477, but we can
not hold that the use of the section in the opinion is not
to be regarded as authority except by directly reversing
the decision in that case on that point, which we do not
wish to do.
An elaborate argument has been made to show that the
section should not apply to the assignment of claims for
infringements of a patent, for the reason that a claim for
infringements is not a common law chose in action but
grows out of rights created by the statutes covering patents, the provisions for their assignment and for suits by

RICHMOND CO. v. UNITED STATES.
331

Opinion of the Court.

the assignee to be found in sections 4898, 4919, 4921
and other related sections. Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye
Tool & Machine Works, 261 U. S. 24, 42, 43. But there is
no conflict between the patent sections and section 3477.
The latter section was passed to protect the Government
and prevent frauds upon the Treasury. Western Pacific
R. R. Co. v. United States, 268 U. S. 271, 275; Seaboard
Air Line Ry. v. United States, 256 U. S. 655, 657; Goodman v. Niblack, 102 U. S. 556, 559, 560. And it would
seem that the danger of exploiting and harrassing the
Government with the use of assignments of claims for
patent infringement was within the general purpose of
that section.
We come then to the question whether section 3477 and
the Brothers case apply to the case before us, and that
requires an interpretation of the amending Act of 1918
and its operation upon the rights of the assignee and
owner of the patent and its claims for infringement. Exceptions to the general language of section 3477 have been
recognized by this Court because not within the evil at
which the statute aimed. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v.
United States, supra; Western PacificR. R. Co. v. United
States, supra; Goodman v. Niblack, supra; Price v. Forrest, 173 U. S. 410, 421-423; Parringtonv. Davis, 285 Fed.
741, 742. We think that the situatiori created by the provisions of the amending Act of 1918 is such that section
3477 does not apply to all of the assigned claims of the
petitioner for infringement under that Act. The Act of
June 25, 1910, c. 423, 36 Stat. 851, provided that whenever an invention described in and covered by a patent of
the United States should thereafter be used by the United
States without license of the owner thereof or lawful right
to use the same, such owner might recover reasonable
compensation for such use by suit in the Court of Claims.
The Act contained a number of provisos, only one of
which is important here, namely, that in any such suit the

United States might avail itself of any and all defenses,
general or special, which might be pleaded by a defendant
in an action for an infringement, as set forth in Title 60
of the Revised Statutes or otherwise.
This Court held, March 4, 1918, in Cramp & Sons v. InternationalCurtis Marine Turbine Company, 246 U. S. 28,
42, 45, that the Act of 1910 did not effect a license to the
United States or the contractor, making the patented device, to make or use the invention, and that the contractor
could be sued for an injunction and for infringement in
spite of the operation of that Act.
On April 20, 1918, the Acting Secretary of the Navy
wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Naval,
Affairs of the Senate, in which he said, referring to the
Cramp case, that the Department was "confronted with a
difficult situation as the result of a recent decision by the
Supreme Court affecting the government's rights as to the
manufacture and use of patented inventions, and it seems
necessary that amendment be made of the Act of June 25,
1910 .... the-decision is, in effect so far as it is of importance here, that a contractor for the manufacture of a
patented article for the government is not exempt, unless
he is only a contributory infringer, from injunction and
other interference through litigation by the patentee.
"A prior decision of the Supreme Court, that in the case
of Crozier v. Krupp, had been interpreted as having the
opposite meaning, and the department was able up to the
time of the later decision, on March 4th last, to proceed
satisfactorily with the procuring of such patented articles
as it needed, leaving the matter of compensation to patentees for adjustment by direct agreement, or, if necessary,
by resort to the Court of Claims under the above mentioned act of 1910. Now, however, manufacturers are
exposed to expensive litigation, involving the possibilities
of prohibitive injunction, payment of royalties, rendering
of accounts, and payment of punitive damages, and they

are reluctant to take contracts that may bring such severe
consequences. The situation promises serious disadvantage to the public interests, and in order that vital
activities of this department may not be restricted unduly
at this time, and also with a view of enabling dissatisfied
patentees to obtain just and adequate compensation in all
cases conformably to the declared purpose of said' act, I
have the honor to request that the act be amended by the
insertion of a proper provision therefor in the pending
naval appropriation bill."
In response to this communication, the Act of July 1,
1918, amending the Act of 1910, was adopted. (See Wood
v. Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co., 296 Fed. 718, 720, 721, and
Congressional Record, 65th Congress, Second Session, Proceedings of June 18, 1918, p. 7961). The amendment (c.
114, 40 Stat. 704, 705) reads as follows:
"That whenever an invention described in and covered
by a patent of the United States shall hereafter be used or
manufactured by or for the United States without license
of the owner thereof or lawful right to use or manufacture
the same, such owner's remedy shall be by suit against
the United States in the Court of Claims for the recovery
of his reasonable and entire compensation for such use and
manufacture."
This is followed by the same provisos as in the Act of
1910, which need not be repeated here.
The purpose of the amendment was to relieve the contractor entirely from liability of every kind for the infringement of patents in manufacturing anything for the
Government and to limit the owner of the patent and his
assigns and all claiming through or under him to suit
against the United States in the Court of Claims for the
recovery of his reasonable and entire compensation for
such use and manufacture. The word "entire" emphasizes the exclusive and comprehensive character of the
remedy provided. As the Solicitor General says in his

344

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

brief with respect to the Act, it is more than a waiver of
immunity and effects an assumption of liability by the
Government.
Under the Act of 1910, the remedy of the owner of a patent where the United States had used the invention without his license or lawful right to use it, was to sue for
reasonable compensation in the Court of Claims, and that
remedy was open to Lenke for the cargo beams covered
by his patent installed and used by the United States before July 1, 1918.
The evidence does not show at what time during the
year 1918 the beams were installed. The first finding is
that Lenke wrote to an officer in the Quartermaster's Department on duty at the Army supply base at Brooklyn,
on December 31, 1918, complaining that the Lenke cargo
beam was being used by the Government at that supply
base without permission from the patentee, but nothing
happened but a fruitless correspondence.
The findings of the Court of Claims show that, on January 1, 1919, 810 of the beams had been installed at the instance of the Government, but how many were installed
after July 1, 1918, when the law in question was passed,
has not been found by the Court of Claims.
On September 29, 1920, the Lenke patent was assigned
by Lenke to one Thomas E. Chappell, who in turn on
March 7, 1921, assigned it to the plaintiff company, in
accordance with the statute, and the assignment in each
case covered all rights of action for past infringements of
the patent and all rights to recoveries by suit for damages,
profits and royalties for infringements of every kind
whatsoever.
It is settled that, but for the Act of 1918, the two assignments vesting title in the Anchor Company would
enable it to recover from the contractor for all his infringements (Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine
Works, supra; Gordon v. Anthony, 16 Blatchf. 234, Fed.

Cas. No. 5,605; Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U. S. 252,
256, 261; Galer v. Wilder, 10 How. 476, 494; Robinson
on Patents, vol. 3, see. 937, p. 122). If now section 3477
applies and these assignments are rendered void, the effect
of the Act of 1918 is to take away from the assignee and
present owner not only the cause of action against the
Government, but also to deprive it of the cause of action
against the infringing contractor for injury by his infringement. The intention and purpose of Congress in
the Act of 1918 was to stimulate contractors to furnish
what was needed for the War, without fear of becoming
liable themselves for infringements to inventors or the
owners or assignees of patents. The letter of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, upon which the Act of 1918
was passed, leaves no doubt that this was the occasion for
it. To accomplish this governmental purpose, Congress
exercised the power to take away the right of the owner
of the patent to recover from the contractor for infringements. This is not a case of a mere declared immunity of
the Government from liability for its own torts. It is an
attempt to take away from a private citizen his lawful
claim for damage to his property by another private person which but for this Act he would have against the
private wrongdoer. This result, if 3477 Rev. Stats. applies
and avoids the assignment, would seem to raise a serious
question as to the constitutionality of the Act of 1918
under the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.
We must presume that Congress in the passage of the Act
of 1918 intended to secure to the owner of the patent the
exact equivalent of what it was taking away from him.
It was taking away his assignable claims against the contractor for the latter's infringement of his patent. The
assignability of such claims was an important element in
their value and a matter to be taken into account in providing for their-just equivalent. If section 3477 applied,
such equivalence was impossible.

OCTOBER. TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

It is our duty in the interpretation of federal statutes
to reach a conclusion which will avoid serious doubt of
their constitutionality. Phelps v. United States, 274
U. S. 341. Moreover, we should seek to carry out in our
dealing with the Act of 1918 and Revised Statutes 3477
the very important Congressional purpose of the former,
as. already explained, in the promotion of the War, as a
special legislative intent. It is our duty to give effect to
that special intent although it be not in harmony with a
broad purpose manifested in a general statute avoiding
assignment of claims against the Government, enacted
some eighty years ago. In re Rouse, Hazard & Co., 91
Fed. 96, 100, 101; Townsend v. Little, 109 U. S. 504, 512;
Vashington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422, 428. This is in accord with general rules of interpretation, as shown in these
authorities, and reconciles section 3477 Revised Statutes
and the Act of 1918, if we hold, as we do, that section
3477 does not apply to the assignment of a claim against
the United States which is created by the Act of 1918 in
so far as the Act deprives the owner of the patent of a
remedy against the infringing private contractor for infringements thereof and makes the Government indemnitor for its manufacturer or contractor in his infringements.
Such a conclusion requires us to reverse the case and
remand it to the Court of Claims for additional findings to
show how many of the patented beams were made by contractors and furnished to the United States after the passage of the Act of July 1, 1918, and what would have been
a reasonable royalty therefor.
The question of the amount of or the rule for measuring
the recovery we do not decide, but leave that for further
argument and consideration by the Court of Claims, because of the novel and only partial application of § 3477
Rev. Stat.
Reversed and remanded.
