CERTIORARI TO TIiE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 156.

Argued October 6, 7, 1927.-Decided November 21, 1927.

Under Revenue Act, 1918, Title III, providing that the "excessprofits" credit of a domestic corporation should "consist of a
specific exemption of $3,000 plus an amount equal to 8 per centum
of the invested capital for the taxable year," (§ 312) and defining
"invested capital," with certain exceptions, as the actual cash and
cash value of other property bona fide paid in for stock or shares,
at the time of such payment and "(3) Paid-in or earned surplus
and undivided profits; not including surplus and undivided profits
earned during the year." Held, that the term "undivided profits"
is employed in its ordinary meaning of an excess in the aggregate
value of the assets of a corporation over the sum of its liabilities,
including capital stock, so that profits earned by a corporation
which were insufficient to offset an impairment of its paid-in
capital, were not "undivided profits," to be included as "invested
capital" in computing the excess-profits credits allowed by the
Act. P. 218.
8 F. (2d) 178 (D. C.), affirmed.
15 F. (2d) 814 (C.C. A.), reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

CERTIORARI,

275 U. S.

273 U. S. 687, to a judgment of the Circuit

Court of Appeals which reversed a judgment of the District Court in favor of the Collector in a suit brought by
the Dairy Company to recover excess-profits taxes.
Solicitor General Mitchell, with whom Assistant Attorney General Willebrandt, and Messrs A. W. Gregg,
General Counsel, and J. R. Wheeler, Special Attorney, Bureau of Internal Revenue, were on the brief, for petitioner.
Messrs. Haydn S. Cole and Ira C. Oehler for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Dairy Company, a Minnesota corporation, brought
this suit against the Collector to recover additional excess-profits taxes assessed against it under Title III of
the Revenue Act of 19181 for its taxable years 1919 and
1920,' and paid under protest. Judgment for the Collector in the District Court, 8 F. (2d) 178, was reversed
by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 15 F. (2d) 814.
The question here is, whether profits earned by the
Company that were insufficient to offset an impairment
of its paid-in capital, were "undivided profits" to be
included as "invested capital" in computing the excessprofits credits allowed by the Act.
Section 312 of the Act provided that the "excess-profits
credit" of a domestic corporation should "consist of a
specific exemption of $3,000 plus an amount equal to 8
per centum of the invested capital for the taxable year."
Section 326 (a) defined the term "invested capital," with
certain exceptions not now material, as the actual cash
140 Stat. 1057, 1088, c. 18.
2These were the fiscal years of the Company ending on the last
day of February in 1919 and 1920, respectively.

They are designated,

and cash value of other property, bona fide paid in for
stock or shares, at the time of such payment, and "(3)
Paid-in or earned surplus and undivided profits; not including surplus and undivided profits earned during the
year." Art. 838 of Treasury Regulations 45' declared
that: "Only true earned surplus and undivided profits
can be included in the computation of invested capital,
In the computation . . . full recognition
must first be given to all expenses incurred and losses
sustained from the original organization of the corporation down to the taxable year. . . . There can, of
course, be no earned surplus or undivided profits until
any deficit or impairment or paid-in capital due to depletion, depreciation, expense, losses, or any other cause has
been made good."
The Company was organized with a paid-in capital of
$145,817.04. At the end of 1917" an operating deficit
of $70,296.12, shown on the books, impaired the capital to
that extent. In 1918, the Company had a net income of
$11,489.26; and in 1919, a net income of $22,908.14.
These earned profits were not distributed, and $29,853.03
thereof remained in the business at the end of 1919, without having been applied to reduce the impairment of the
capital.
In the returns on which the excess-profits taxes were
originally assessed and paid, the Company, treating these
earnings as "undivided profits" constituting part of its
"invested capital," reported as invested capital for 1919
the sum of the paid-in capital, $145,817.04, and the profits,
$11,489.26, earned in 1918; and as invested capital for
1920, the sum of the paid-in capital and the $29,853.03
of profits earned in 1918 and 1919 and remaining in the
business.

Thereafter, on an audit of the returns, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, while allowing for each year
as "invested capital" the amount of paid-in capital, excluded from the computation of the "invested capital"
the amounts claimed as "undivided profits," on the
ground that they did not constitute true "undivided
profits," but should be applied to reduce the impairment
of the capital. And on the basis of such exclusions he
assessed the additional taxes.
We think that clause (3) relating to "surplus and undivided profits" was correctly interpreted by Art. 838 of
the Treasury Regulations. Both these terms, as commonly employed in corporate accounting, denote an excess in the aggregate value of all the assets of a corporation over the sum of all its liabilities, including capital
stock. See Edwards v. Douglas, 269 U. S. 204, 214;
Insurance Co. of North America v. McCoach (D. C.), 218
Fed. 905, 908. Aside from the fact that a surplus may
not only be "earned," as where it is derived from undistributed profits, but "paid-in," as where the stock is
issued at a price above par, the distinction between these
terms, as commonly employed, is that the term "surplus"
describes such part of the excess in the value of the corporate assets as is treated by the corporation as part of
its permanent capital, usually carried on the books in a
separate "surplus account "; while the term "undivided
profits'" designates such part of the excess as consists of
profits "which have neither been distributed as dividends
nor carried to surplus account." Edwards v. Douglas,
supra, 214. But it is a prerequisite to the existence of
"undivided profits" as well as a "surplus," that the net
assets of the corporation exceed the capital stock. Hence,
where the capital is impaired, profits, though earned and
remaining in the business, if insufficient to offset this
impairment do not constitute "undivided profits."

WILLCUTS v. MILTON DAIRY CO.
215

Opinion of the Court.

We cannot doubt that this term was used in clause (3)
with its ordinary meaning, nor agree with the view of the
Circuit Court of Appeals that the arbitrary definition
given by the Act to the term "invested capital" not
equivalent to that of the ordinary invested capital of
commerce, indicates that the words " surplus and undivided profits" were not used with their ordinary meaning
as conditioned by an excess of assets. We do not think
Congress intended that a corporation whose capital was
impaired should be entitled to treat profits that, though
earned, were insufficient to make good the impairment
and create a surplus, as "undivided profits." This would
not only give the term "undivided profits" a meaning
entirely at variance with ordinary usage-making it
merely equivalent to any earned profits remaining in the
business-but would grant the privilege of twice disregarding the impairment of capital, that is, once in computing the paid-in capital, which under the express terms
of the Act was to be taken at the full cash or money
value at the time of payment, and again in computing
the "undivided profits." This term is entirely inapt to
express such a purpose.
This conclusion is in harmony with the general view
expressed in LaBelle Iron Works v. United States, 256
U. S. 377, 388. Dealing there in another aspect with the
Revenue Act of 1917, which contained a similar clause
concerning the inclusion of "paid-in or earned surplus
and undivided profits " as "invested capital" in determining the amount of the excess-profits tax, this Court said,
arguendo, that in order to avoid exaggerated valuation
of invested capital "the act resorted to the test of including nothing but money, or money's worth, actually contributed or converted in exchange for shares of the capital
stock, or actually acquired through the business activities
of the corporation . . . and coming in ab extra, by

way of increase over the original capital stock," and that
the provision including "paid in or earned surplus and
undivided profits used or employed in the business" recognized "that in some cases contributions are received
from stockholders in money or its equivalent for the
specific purpose of creating an actual excess capital over
and above the par value of the stock." And see Appeal
of Valdosta Grocery Co., 2 B. T..A. 727, 729, and Appeal
of Gould Copper Co., 5 B. T. A. 499, 517.
The fact that under Title II of the Revenue Act of
1918 providing for an income tax, a corporation, as was
held in Long Beach Improvement Co. v. Commissioner
of InternalRevenue, 5 B. T. A. 590, was subject to a tax
upon its net income despite an impairment of its capital,
is not of moment. The deductions from gross income
allowed by that Title do not refer to invested capital,
surplus or undivided profits, and its provisions throw no
light upon the meaning of those terms as used in Title
III providing for an excess-profits tax.
The judgment of the District Court is affirmed; and
that of the Circuit Court of Appeals
Reversed.
