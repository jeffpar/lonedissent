HEINER v. COLONIAL TRUST CO.
232

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Respondent's decedent procured an oil lease from the
Tribal Council of the Osage Tribe of Indians covering
land of the Tribe in Oklahoma. The lease was in the
form prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior and was
approved by him. The lessor reserved as royalties an
agreed percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale of
the oil produced, to be paid to the Superintendent of the
Osage Indian Agency. On the net income derived by
decedent from the sale of the oil between 1917 and 1921
there were assessed and collected income taxes aggregating more than $800,000. Respondent brought these suits
in the district court for western Pennsylvania to recover
the tax paid, on the theory that, as the interests of the
Indians were concerned, Congress had not intended by
the various revenue acts to tax the income derived from
the exploitation of their lands by non-Indian lessees, and
that it was thus impliedly exempt from the tax. Judgments of the district court for respondent [12 Fed. (2d)
481] were affirmed by the court of appeals for the third
circuit [17 Fed. (2d) 36] and the cases are here on certiorari, the parties having stipulated that No. 220 shall
abide the result in No. 219.
Section 1 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1916 (c. 463, 39
Stat. 756) provides:
"That there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and
paid annually upon the entire net income received in the
preceding calendar year from all sources by every individual, a citizen or resident of the United States, a
tax

.

." at specified rates.

Section 2 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1916, as amended
by the Act of 1917, (c. 63, 40 Stat. 300, 329) provides:
"That, subject only to such exemptions and deductions'
as are hereinafter allowed, the net income of a taxable
person shall include gains
.
growing out of the
S.use of or interest in real or personal property,

also [gains] from . . . the transaction of
any business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or
profits and income derived from any source whatever."
The pertinent sections of the later revenue acts during
the period do not differ materially from those quoted
from the 1916 Act. Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,
§§ 210, 213, 40 Stat. 1057, 1062, 1065; Act of November
23, 1921, c. 136, §§ 210, 213, 42 Stat. 227, 233, 237.
These statutes in terms plainly embrace the income of
a non-Indian lessee derived from the lease of restricted
Indian lands. But we are reminded by respondent that
both the lease here involved and the income it brings the
lessee are beyond the taxing power of the states, for the
lease is merely the instrument which the government has
chosen to use in fulfilling its task of developing to the
fullest the lands and resources of its wards, and a state
may not by taxation lessen the attractiveness of leases
for such a purpose, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501;
Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522; and see Choctaw & Gulf R. R. v. Harrison, 235 U. S. 292; Jaybird
Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U. S. 609; and reliance is placed
on those cases indicating that general acts of Congress are
not applicable to the Indians where to apply them would
affect the Indians adversely. Washington v. Miller, 235
U. S. 422, 427, 428; Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U. S. 94, 100.
The conclusion then urged on us is that Congress cannot
be held to have intended by the general provisions of the
revenue acts to tax the incomes of the Indians themselves; nor by taxing that of their lessees to do itself
what the states are forbidden to do.
The power of the United States to tax the income is
undoubted. It seems to us extravagant, in the face of
the comprehensive language of the statute, to infer that
Congress did not intend to exercise that power merely

Opinion of the Court.

because, in the absence of congressional consent, it is one
withheld from the states or because the tax in terms imposed on others may have some economic effect upon the
Indians themselves. The disposition of Congress has
been to extend the income tax as far as it can to all species
of income, despite immunity from state taxation. During the period now in question the compensation of many
federal officials was subject to federal income tax, and
income from government bonds was taxed except when
expressly exempted.
Assuming that the Indians are not subject to the income tax, as contended, the fact that they are wards of
the government is not a persuasive reason for inferring a
purpose to exempt from taxation the income of others
derived from their dealing with the Indians. Tax exemptions are never lightly to be inferred, Vicksburg, etc.,
R. R. v. Dennis, 116 U. S. 665, 668; Philadelphia& Wilmington R. R. v. Maryland, 10 How. 376, 393, and we
think any implication of an exemption of the income of
the Indians themselves, if made, must rest on too narrow
a basis to justify the inclusion of the income of other
persons merely because the statute, if applied as written,
may have some perceptible economic effect on the
Indians.
It is not without weight that the Treasury Department
from the beginning has consistently collected income tax
from lessees of Indian oil lands running into vast amounts.
If this was contrary to the intention of Congress it is reasonable to suppose that this practice of the Department
would have been specifically corrected in some of the revisions of the laws taxing income in 1917, 1919, 1921, 1924
or 1926. Compare National Lead Co. v. United States,
252 U. S. 140, 145, 146.
Reversed.
