Statement of the Case.

time to reach them the shot was fired. Fonvielle knew
that Dallas had a pistol, but there was a strike at the time;
Dallas was a special policeman and had a right to carry it,
and not unnaturally did. The only sinister designs, of
which there is any evidence, were of Southwell against
Dallas, unless Dallas' remark just before the shooting be
taken to foreshadow the event, which it certainly did not
seem to until after the event had happened. It appears
to us extravagant to hold the petitioner liable in a case
like this. See St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Mills,
271 U. S. 344.

BALTIMORE & OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY v.
GOODMAN, ADMINISTRATRIX.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 58. Argued October 20, 1927.-Decided October 31, 1927.
1. One who drives upon a railroad track relying upon not having heard
a train or any signal and taking no further precaution, does so at
his own risk. If he can not otherwise be sure whether a train is
dangerously near, the driver must stop and get out of his vehicle
before attempting to cross. P. 69.
2. In an action for negligence the question of due care is not left to
the jury when resolved by a clear standard of conduct which should
be laid down by the courts. P. 70.
10 F. (2d) 58, reversed.

CERTIORARI, 271 U. S. 658, to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals sustaining a recovery for death caused
by alleged negligence of the Railroad, in an action by the
widow and administratrix of the deceased. The action
was removed from an Ohio state court on the ground of
diversity of citizenship.

Mr. A. McL. Marshall, with whom Messrs. Byron B.
Harlan, Morison R. Waite, and William A. Eggers were

Mr. Robert N. Brumbaugh, with whom Mr. I. L. Jacobson was on the brief, for respondent.
The Circuit Court of Appeals found that the decedent
could not see north of the tool shed until the front of his
truck was less than twenty feet from the west rail. The

evidence was uncontradicted that the seat in which the
decedent, as the driver of the truck, was sitting was six
feet back from the front of the machine, and that the
overhang of the railroad engine was two and one-half feet.
Therefore, the front of his truck was within eleven and
one-half feet from the danger point, before he could first
see past the tool shed, behind which was the approaching
train. Traveling at five to six miles per hour, he was
covering seven to eight feet per second. Therefore, he had
only one and one-half seconds interval to guide his conduct. Hearing no signal, no bell, or other warning, he had
been led into a trap. The Railway Company seeks to
hold him guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of
law, upon what he could or could not do in one and onehalf seconds. To merely state the proposition is to answer it. Flannelly v. Del. & Hud. Co., 225 U. S. 597;
Beckman v. Hines, 279 Fed. 241; Wise v. Del. &c. R. R.,
81 N. J. L. 397; L. E. Ry. v. Summers, 125 Fed. 719; 192
U. S. 607; Grand Trunk Ry. v. Ives, 144 U. S. 408.
The true meaning of the rule contended for by the petitioner is well expressed by the trial judge thus: " In effect,
the contention of the defendant goes to the extent of urging that in no case of a daylight automobile crossing accident, in which a view of the track can be had even though
but a short distance from the rails, can there be a recovery." We cannot believe that such is the law in any Circuit of the United States. D. L. & W. Ry. v. Rebman, 285
Fed. 317; Smith v. N. Y. C. Ry., 177 N. Y. 224.
The petitioner is asking this court to fix a standard in
law by which a court is enabled to arbitrarily say in every
case of a daylight automobile crossing accident in which
any view of the track can be had, even though a short distance from the rails, what conduct shall be considered
reasonable and prudent on the part of the driver of the
automobile under any and all circumstances. There is no
such "fixed standard." Grand Trunk Ry. v. Ives, 144

Opinion of the Court.

U. S. 417. See Continental Imp. Co. v. Stead, 99 U. S.
161. The cases cited by petitioner were decided under
their peculiar facts, just as was the case at bar.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a suit brought by the widow and administratrix
of Nathan Goodman against the petitioner for causing his
death by running him down at a grade crossing. The
defence is that Goodman's own negligence caused the
death. At the trial, the defendant asked the Court to
direct a verdict for it, but the request, and others looking
to the same direction, were refused, and the plaintiff got
a verdict and a judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 10 F. (2d) 58.
Goodman was driving an automobile truck in an easterly direction and was killed by a train running southwesterly across the road at a rate of not less than sixty
miles an hour. The line was straight, but it is said by the
respondent that Goodman ' had no practical view' beyond
a section house two hundred and forty-three feet north of
the crossing until he was about twenty feet from the first
rail, or, as the respondent argues, twelve feet from danger,
and that then the engine was still obscured by the section
house. He had been driving at the rate of ten or twelve
miles an hour, but had cut down his rate to five or six
miles at about forty feet from the crossing. It is thought
that there was an emergency in which, so far as appears,
Goodman did all that he could.
We do not go into further details as to Goodman's precise situation, beyond mentioning that it was daylight
and that he was familiar with the crossing, for it appears
to us plain that nothing is suggested by the evidence to
relieve Goodman from responsibility for his own death.
When a man goes upon a railroad track he knows that he
goes to a place where he will be killed if a train comes
upon him before he is clear of the track. He knows that

he must stop for the train, not the train stop for him. In
such circumstances it seems to us that if a driver cannot
be sure otherwise whether a train is dangerously near he
must stop and get out of his vehicle, although obviously
he will not often be required to do more than to stop and
look. It seems to us that if he relies upon not hearing the
train or any signal and takes no further precaution he does
so at his own risk. If at the last moment Goodman found
himself in an emergency it was his own fault that he did
not reduce his speed earlier or come to a stop. It is true
as .said in Flannelly v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 225 U. S.
597, 603, that the question of due care very generally is
left to the jury. But we are dealing with a standard of
conduct, and when the standard is clear it should be laid
down once for all by the Courts. See Southern Pacific
Co. v. Berkshire, 254 U. S. 415, 417, 419.
Judgment reversed.
FAIRMONT CREAMERY COMPANY v. MINNESOTA.
MOTION TO IRETAX COSTS.

No. 725, October Term, 1926. Submitted October 17, 1927.-Decided
November 21, 1927.
1. A clause imposing costs inserted in a final judgment of this Court
by the clerk and approved by the Justice who wrote the opinion
disposing of the case, is the act of the Court, not merely of the
clerk, and is beyond the power of the Court to recall after expiration of the term. So held where no petition for rehearing was
made within the 40 days allowed by Rule 30. P. 72.
2. As a party to litigation in this Court, a State is not immune to
costs in virtue of its sovereignty. P. 73.
3. A rule as to the awarding and division of costs is within the
inherent authority of this Court as to all litigants before it, except
the United States. P. 74.
