CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.

Nos. 115 and 116.

Argued December 5, 1927.-Decided January 3,
1928.

1. Under § 6 of the Chinese Exclusion Act, as amended, which provides that Chinese entitled to enter the United States shall be identified by the Chinese Government or "such other foreign Government of which at the time such Chinese person shall be a subject,"
the term "subject" is used in its narrower sense and includes only
those who by birth or naturalization owe permanent allegiance to
the government issuing the certificates. P. 477.
2. Therefore, Chinese cannot enter on a certificate of a government
other than China to which they owe only temporary allegiance,
though residing and transacting business within its territory.
P. 477.
3. Reenactment of a statutory provision without change is a legislative approval of the practical construction that it had received.
P. 481.
13 F. (2d) 80, reversed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE

275 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

Respondents, Chinese merchants born in China and
never naturalized elsewhere, applied at the port of San
Francisco for admission into the United States. They
had resided in French Indo-China and been engaged in
business there for a number of years. They presented to
the immigration authorities certificates of identification
issued by officials of French Indo-China with visas by the
American Consul at Saigon, French Indo-China. They
were denied admission on the ground that the certificate
of identification required by § 6 of the Chinese Exclusion
Act, Act of May 6, 1882, c. 126, 22 Stat. 58, 60, as
amended by the Act of July 5, 1884, c. 220, 23 Stat. 115,
116, 117; U. S. C., Title 8, § 265, was a certificate of the
government of which respondents were subjects, in this
case the Chinese government, and not a certificate of the
government of French Indo-China, where respondents
merely resided. Their petitions for writs of habeas corpus
were denied by the district court for northern California.
On appeal the two cases were consolidated in the court of
appeals for the ninth circuit, and the judgments of the
district court reversed. 13 Fed. (2d) 80. This Court
granted certiorari. 273 U. S. 682.
Article II of the treaty of November 17, 1880, between
the United States and China, 22 Stat. 826, 827, provides
for the admission of Chinese subjects "proceeding to the
United States as . . . merchants." Section 15 of the
Exclusion Act, as amended, makes the act applicable "to
all subjects of China and Chinese, whether subjects of
China or any other foreign power." Section 6 as amended
(the relevant portions are in the margin1) requires
1 ,, Sec. 6. That in order to the faithful execution of the provisions
of this act, every Chinese person, other than a laborer, who may be
entitled by said treaty or this act to come within the United States,
and who shall be about to come to the United States, shall obtain the

Opinion of the Court.

"every Chinese person other than a laborer, who may be
entitled by said treaty or this act" to admission, to "obtain the permission of and be identified as so entitled by
the Chinese Government, or of such other foreign Government of which at the time such Chinese person shall
be a subject." The sole question presented is whether
the word "subject" as used in § 6 is to be taken as including only those persons who by birth or naturalizatioh owe
permanent allegiance to the government issuing the certificate, or as embracing also those who, being domiciled
within the territorial limits of that government, owe it for
that reason obedience and temporary allegiance.
The word may be used in either sense. See The Pizarro,
2 Wheat. 227, 245; Carlisle v. United States, 16 Wall. 147,
154. If the narrower meaning be the appropriate one the
respondents were "subjects" of the Chinese government,
and it alone could issue certificates entitling them to admission. The government of French Indo-China could
issue such certificates only to persons of the Chinese race
who owed it permanent allegiance.
The circuit court of appeals thought that since the
statute was in execution of a treaty with China-which
related only to the immigration of Chinese nationals--the
provisions in § 6 for the certification of identity could
have no application to persons of Chinese race who were
nationals of other governments, and so concluded that
certificates were required of governments other than
China only in the case of Chinese nationals resident under
those governments.
But in this view it is overlooked that the amended
Exclusion Act is broader than the treaty. Before the
amendment the federal courts had not agreed whether
permission of and be identified as so entitled by the Chinese Government, or of such other foreign Government of which at the time such
Chinese person shall be a subject. .... "

persons of Chinese race who were nationals of countries
other than China were affected by the statute. United
States v. Douglas, 17 Fed. 634; In re Ah Lung, 18 Fed. 28.
Section 15 of the amended act made all its provisions
applicable "to all subjects of China and Chinese, whether
subjects of China or any other foreign power." The
avowed purpose of the amendment was to alter the act as
interpreted in United States v. Douglas, supra, where it
had been held to have no application to Chinese subjects
of Great Britain. Report of Committee on Foreign Affairs, 48th Cong., 1st Sess., H. Rep. 614, p. 2.2 The purpose, therefore, of the insertion in § 6 of the phrase "of
such other foreign Government of which at the time such
Chinese person shall be a subject," was to require Chinese
immigrants owing permanent allegiance to governments
other than China to present certificates from the governments of their allegiance.
Something may be said in support of the view that the
more usual and, perhaps, more accurate use of the word
"subject" is that contended for by the government.

also that the importance of administrative convenience
2 The very fact that the amended act went beyond the scope of the
treaty and affected Chinese nationals of powers other than China
was one source of the objections of the Committee minority. "It
is perhaps worthy of notice that this section not only attempts to
make more stringent restrictive regulations against Chinese laborers,
subjects of China, with whom we have some show of right, under a
treaty, to make them, and against the Chinese subjects of other nations, with whom we have no such treaty stipulations, but that its
other provisions unquestionably exceed the scope of the treaty with
China." Report of Committee on Foreign Affairs, Views of the
Minority, 48th Cong. 1st Sess., H. Rep. 614, p. 5.

and certainty in a statute of this character suggests that
the word was used as indicating citizenship by birth or
naturalization, a status more easily ascertained than that
of domicile or residence. But these considerations need
not detain us in view of the history of the legislation, to
which we have already referred, and of the long and consistent practical construction of the act.
Both governments appear to have treated § 6, as
amended, as requiring the certificate to be issued by the
Chinese government, except where the immigrant owes
permanent allegiance to another foreign government.'
The administrative regulations of the various departments have from the first required that the certificates of
Chinese subjects coming from countries other than China

be issued by Chinese consular officers.'

3 On December 6, 1884, in pursuance of the amendment of that
year, the Secretary of the Treasury declared in a circular to the officers of the customs that "Chinese subjects . . . desiring to come
to the United States from countries other than China, may do so on
production of a certificate . . . to be issued by a Chinese diplomatic
or consular officer, or if there be no such Chinese officer at such port,

on a like certificate to be issued by a United States consular officer."
Foreign Relations, 1885, p. 192. Although this regulation, in so far
as it permits the original issue of certificates to be made by American
consular officers, went beyond the statute, it clearly indicates that
Chinese nationals resident abroad were required to procure certificates
not from the government of their residence but from the Chinese
government or an American consular officer. In the case of certain
Chinese merchants resident in Hong Kong, the Chinese government
requested that the statute and regulation be so applied. Memorandum, received August 5, 1885, Mr. Cheng Tsao Ju to Mr. Bayard,
Foreign Relations, 1885, p. 184. To this the State Department acceded. Mr. Bayard to Cheng Tsao Ju, August 11, 1885, Foreign

This interpretation was accepted by President Cleveland in his special message of April 6, 1886.' 8 Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 391. He
recommended legislation permitting the certificate in the
case of Chinese nationals, resident in other foreign countries where there were no Chinese consular officers, to be
issued by United States consuls in those countries. The
Chinese government has uniformly authorized its diplomatic and consular officers in foreign countries to issue
such certificates in the case of Chinese subjects resident
there.' The validity of such certificates issued to Chinese
subjects by consular officers of China in other foreign

5 The President thus stated the effect of § 6: It "provides in terms
for the issuance of certificates in two cases only: (a) Chinese subjects departing from a port of China; and (b) Chinese persons (i. e.,
of the Chinese race) who may at the time be subjects of some foreign
government other than China, and who may depart for the United
States from the ports of such other foreign government
"It is sufficient that I should call the earnest attention of Congress to the circumstance that the statute makes no provision whatever for the somewhat numerous class of Chinese persons who, retaining their Chinese subjection in some countries other than China, desire
to come from such countries to the United States."
.He recognized that the amended statute went beyond the scope of
the treaty by saying, "A statute is certainly most unusual which,
purporting to execute the provisions of a treaty with China in respect
of Chinese subjects, enacts strict formalities as regards the subjects
of other governments than that of China." 8 Richardson, Messages
and Papers of the Presidents, 391, 392.

countries has been recognized by the Department of State
and upheld by the Attorney General.'
Added weight is given to this course of practical con.
struction by the history of Article III of the treaty with
China of March 17, 1894, 28 Stat. 1210, and of the later
legislation reenacting the Exclusion Act. Article III provided that Chinese subjects entitled to admission might
"produce a certificate from their Government or the Government where they last resided." The very fact that it
was thought necessary to incorporate this provision in the
treaty is a recognition that the prexisting legislation did
not have that effect. The treaty expired by limitation in
1904 and was not renewed. While it was in force Chinese
nationals, resident abroad, could be admitted to the United
States on presentation of a certificate either of the Chinese
government, as authorized by § 6, or of the government
of their residence, as permitted by the treaty. During the
life of the treaty, the amended Exclusion Act, continued
in force for ten years from May 5, 1892 by the act of that
date, c. 60, § 1, 27 Stat. 25, would have expired. But by
the Act of April 29, 1902, c. 641, 1§ 1, 32 Stat. 176, "all
laws now in force . . . regulating the coming of Chinese
persons . . . into the United States . . . are hereby, reenacted, extended and continued so far as the same are
not inconsistent with treaty obligations, until otherwise
provided by law." By this statute the certificate provisions of § 6 of the amended Exclusion Act were continued
indefinitely and, on the expiration in 1904 'of the treaty
of 1894, became the only law on that subject. The rein7 Mr. Wharton to Mr. Tsui, June 17, 1891, Foreign Relations, 1891,

actment of § 6 unchanged, and subject only to the provisions of a treaty .now expired, must be accepted as a legislative approval of the practical construction the section
had received. Compare National Lead Co. v. United
States, 252 U. S. 140.
If there could be doubt as to the proper interpretation
of § 6 standing alone, we think all ambiguity has been
removed by the history of the legislation and the practical
construction which has been given to it.
