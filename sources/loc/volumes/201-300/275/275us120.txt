LEACH & COMPANY, INC. v. PEIRSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 78. Argued October 27, 1927.-Decided November 21, 1927.
1. Semble that under the Conformity Acts, rules of evidence established by decisions of the highest court of the State apply to an
action on contract between private parties in the District Court.
P. 127.
2. A man cannot make evidence for himself by writing a letter containing the statements that he wishes to prove. He does not make
the letter evidence by sending it to the party against whom he
wishes to prove the facts. P. 128.
3. 'A, having bought bonds of B through B's sales-agent, wrote B
that the purchase was made upon the understanding that B would
repurchase at the same price at A's request, and that he desired
to avail himself of that privilege. Held that B was under no
duty to answer the letter and that the letter was inadmissible to
prove the salesman's authority to make the agreement asserted.

16 F. (2d) 86, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 273 U. S. 676, to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment recovered by

There is a lack of uniformity in the decisions of the
various Circuit Courts of Appeals as to whether or not,
under the Conformity Acts, the federal courts are, in the
trial of a common law case, bound to follow the rules of
evidence of the highest court of the State in which the
trial is held. Chicago &c. Ry. v. Kendall, 167 Fed. 62;

federal courts in the trial of a common law case in New
York were not bound by 1§34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789

275 U. S.

to follow the settled decisions of the courts of that State
on a question of general commercial law. The case has
been frequently followed and affirmed. It must be regarded as settled law. And the re-enactment of the section in the same words, carries with it the interpretation
of the section which had been placed upon it before it
was re-enacted.
But the scope of § 34 should not be further restricted
under the authority of Swift v. Tyson. Section 34 provides that "the laws of the several states" shall be
regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in
the courts of the United States in cases where they apply.
The opinion of Mr. Justice Story holds that "laws"
covers only statutes and long established local customs
having the force of laws. It can hardly be questioned
that this decision would have been a surprise if it had been
made fifty years before. In those early days, the only
laws known (apart from statutes) were those which
formed a part of the common law of the State. If
lower federal courts were to be created, the common
law of the State in which a trial was held was the only
law by which they could be guided. There was no
common law of the United States. So obvious was this
that when the Judiciary Draft Bill was introduced in the
Senate in 1789, it contained no provisions such as are
now found in § 34. This section was added during the
debate. It seemed unnecessary.
There was a very significant amendment in the section.
The words "the statute laws of the several states" were
stricken out and the words "the laws of the several
states" were substituted. Charles Warren, 37 Harv. Law
Rev. 49. In changing "statute law" to "laws" the
amendment also struck out the words "their unwritten or
common law now in use, whether by adoption from the
common law of England, the ancient statutes of the same
or otherwise." If Ellsworth had intended only that the

LEACH & CO. v. PEIRSON.
120

Argument for Respondent.

statutes of the several States should be rules of decision,
he, apparently, would have retained " statute law" and
taken out the reference to the "unwritten common law,"
but by changing "statute law to "laws" he must have
meant to use a more comprehensive word which should
cover the unwritten common law of the several States.
and therefore he omitted those words.
Even the Federalists had no idea of creating lowe federal courts to administer a common law of their own.*
And the Anti-Federalists were originally strongly opposed
to the creation of any federal courts. In fact, the Judiciary Act was a hard-fought compromise betwen the Federalists who would give the federal courts the full jurisdiction authorized in the Constitution and their opponents
who were unwilling to create any lower federal courts.
And in this compromise, the jurisdiction of the lower
federal courts was extended to but little more than admiralty cases and cases of citizenship. A single case of
the broad interpretation of the section need be given.
Simsims v. Irvine, 3 Dall. 425.
The decision in Swift v. Tyson, supra, was, undoubtedly, a movement or trend towards the idea of nationalism, which, as Charles Francis Adams has said, began
with Story, then Webster, and then the Nullification
Proclamation. In those days, "questions of jurisdiction
were questions of power as between the United States
and the several states." Today the pendulum is swinging back to state rights, and it is here submitted that it
will be wiser to strengthen rather than weaken, as Justice
Story did, the command of § 34. See dissenting opinion
in B. & 0. R.R. v. Baugh, 149 U. S. 368.
Mr. John A. Brown, with*whom Mr. Henry P. Brown
was on the brief, for respondent.
The petitioner cannot raise in this Court a question
of law not raised in the District Court nor in the Circuit

Court of Appeals. L. & N. R. R. v. Parker, 242 U. S. 13;
Atl. Coast L. R. R. v. Mims, 242 U. S. 532; 3 Cor. Jur.
723, § 619.
No other cases in Pennsylvania support the statement
that in Pennsylvania there is a settled rule of law that
under no circumstances and for no purposes is a selfserving, unanswered letter admissible in favor of the
writer. All that the Pennsylvania cases cited by petitioner
decide is that, upon the facts of those cases, the letter
offered by the writer was not admissible. See Hershey v.
Love, 278 Pa. 161; Cosgrove v. Himmelrich, 54 Pa. 203;
Phila. R. R. Co. v. Cowell, 28 Pa. 329.
It is, therefore, not necessary to consider whether there
is a diversity of decisions in the different circuit courts on
the question whether the Conformity Acts require federal courts in common law trials to follow the rules of
evidence of the state courts in which the trial is held,
because, (1) in the District Court no attempt was made
to show a local rule of evidence binding on that court,
and no assignment of error in the Circuit Court of Appeals was taken to the failure to follow the rule of evidence of the local court; and, (2) even if the decisions
of Pennsylvania courts had been cited by petitioner in
support of a distinctive local rule of evidence, these cases
fail to show any such rule.
The certiorari granted in this case should be dismissed
as was done in Layne Bowler Corp. v. Western Webb
Works, 261 U. S. 387.
It is well settled that a general exception to a charge
is insufficient. There was no error in admitting in evidence the letter of May 9, 1921, nor in holding that petitioner's failure to reply to it, under the facts in the case,
was some evidence from which the jury might find ratification of the contract of repurchase made by petitioner's
agent.

LEACH & CO. v. PEIRSON.
120

Argument for Respondent.

The cases cited by petitioner may be divided into
several groups.
1. Where the letters were written after the contract
had been fully performed or the transaction closed,
Fraley v. Bispham, 10 Pa. 320; Dempsey v. Dobson,
174 Pa. 123; Kann v. Bennett, 223 Pa. 86; Packer v.
United States, 106 Fed. 906; Woolsey v. Haynes, 165 Fed.
391; Thrush v. Fullhart,210 Fed. 1.
2. Letters containing an argumentative presentation of
the writer's case against the other party: Dempsey v.
Dobson, 174 Pa. 122; Kann v. Bennett, 223 Pa. 36; Viele
v. McLean, 200 N. Y. 260; Chicago v. McKechney, 205
Ill. 372.
3. Letters whose only purpose was to inform the receiver that if he did not accede to the writer's demands
he would be held liable: Kumin v. Fine, 229 Mass. 75;
State v. Howell, 61 N. J. L. 142; Biggs v. Stueler, 93 Md.
100; Seevers v. Coal Co., 158 Ia. 574; Bank v. McCabe,
135 Mich. 479;. Marino v. Vecchio, 83 Pa. Sup. Ct. 377;
McNally v. Madison Ave. Corp., 211 N. Y. 25.
When a letter is written in the course of the performance of a contract, to enable the writer to avail himself
of some right under the contract, or to give some notice
that may be necessary to establish his claim in court, or
meet some defense raised against his claim, such letter is
admissible for the writer if its terms do not go beyond the
demand or notice with the explanation necessary to render
it intelligible. The effect of this notice or demand will
depend on the substantive law applicable to the facts of
the case and the situation of the parties. It is submitted
that the letter at bar was not purely self-serving. At the
time it was written there was no breach, nor even a controversy between the parties; it was written to secure
performance of the contract; there is nothing in it to
suggest that it was written by the respondent with a view

of making evidehce for himself, nor was there anything to
indicate that it was used at the trial to enable the respondent to have the benefit of his statement out of court,
of the contract made with the agent. There had been
sufficient proof of the making of the agreement.
Without any loss to itself, petitioner could have retaken the bonds at the purchase price. By its silence on
this subject and making the respondent the loan on the
bonds, petitioner deferred meeting the issue as to whether
the agent had authority to make the agreement. If
respondent had failed to prove that petitioner had notice
of its agent's agreement until after the bonds had depreciated in value, petitioner could have set up by way of
defense that it was not bound to allow a 'rescission of the
sale on such terms as would impose a loss on it. Therefore, it became necessary for respondent to show notice
of the agent's agreement and the terms of such notice.
The duty of petitioner on receiving the letter was then
determined by the law of agency. Its silence was some
evidence of ratification. Gold Min. Co. v. Nat. Bank, 96
U. S. 640; Phila. R. R. v. Cowell, 28 Pa. 329; Morris
v. Handy, 3 F. (2d) 97; Williston, Contracts, § 278;
Mechem, Agency, vol. 1, § 454; 2 Cor. Jur. 505. When
petitioner received the letter, if it did not approve and
accept its agent's contract, it was its duty to inform the
respondent, and return the consideration and take back
the bonds, for this is all the letter called for. Ratification
was therefore to be inferred from the failure to restore
the consideration. Sturtevant v. Wallack, 141 Mass. 119;
Morris v. Norton, 75 Fed. 912; Auringer v. Cochrane, 225
Mass. 273; Boice Co. v. Kelley, 243 Mass. 327; Gifford v.
Gifford, 224 Mass. 302; Mechem, Agency, vol. 1, § 436;

MR. JusTicE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

Opinion of the Court.

the purchase price, bonds sold by the petitioner to the
plaintiff. The petitioner is a bond house doing a large
business, and the only evidence of its having made such
a contract was the testimony of the plaintiff that Mather,
a salesman, made the promise on the petitioner's behalf,
coupled with a letter the admissibility of which is the
question here. The purchases were on June 19, 1920,
September 23, 1920, and February 28, 1921. The plaintiff testified that on May 9, 1921, he wrote to the petitioner that when he made the second purchase "it was
agreed by Mr. Mather that at any time I so desired you
would take them off my hands at cost 98. I have need
of some money and will avail myself of this privilege.
When shall I deliver them to you." The officers of the
petitioner denied ever having received the letter and
denied the authority of Mather to make any such agree.
ment. It may be mentioned further, although it is not
relevant to the question here, that Mather denied having
made the contracts alleged. The letter was offered in
evidence. It was objected to, as a self serving document
but was admitted subject to exceptions. There was no
other evidence of Mather's authority, but the jury were
instructed that, if the petitioner received the letter and
failed to disaffirm what Peirson said Mather had done,
they would be justified in finding that the petitioner acquiesced in the agreement and that Mather had authority
to do what Peirson said he did. The plaintiff got a verdict and judgment and the judgment was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, 16 F. (2d) 86. On a suggestion
of conflict between this and other Circuit Courts of Appeal
and of failure to conform to the rule of evidence in Pennsylvania, (a failure in no way affected by the fact that the
same rule 'prevails in most Courts of high authority,) as
also of a difference among the Courts as to the scope of
the Conformity Acts, a writ of certiorari was granted by
this Court. 273 U. S. 676.

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

275 U. S.

A man cannot make evidence fdr himself by writing
a letter containing the statements that he wishes to prove.
He does not make the letter evidence by sending it to the
party against whom he wishes to prove the facts. He no
more can impose a duty to answer a charge than he can
impose a duty to pay by sending goods. Therefore, a
failure to answer such adverse assertions in the absence
of further circumstances making an answer requisite or
natural has no effect as an admission. Fraleyv. Bispham,

[1921] 1 K. B. 22.
There were no circumstances in this case to take it out
of the general rule. The letter might have been admissible as a demand if a binding contract had been proved,
but until evidence of Mather's authority was given the
demand was immaterial. It is true that, two days after
that on which the plaintiff says that he wrote the letter
that we have quoted, the petitioner lent to the plaintiff
$15,000 on the security of the $20,000 bonds in question
with the usual powers of sale and the plaintiff's note. It
would be the merest speculation to regard the plaintiff's
story as confirmed by this loan. It may as probably have
been an independent transaction, and it might be argued
at least as plausibly that the plaintiff's note and assent
to the severe conditions of a pledge to brokers was inconsistent with the right that he now asserts. No evidence
having been given of Mather's authority to make the
contract in suit the petitioner was entitled to a verdict.
The request that one should be directed should have been
granted. A new trial must be awarded.
Judgment reversed.
