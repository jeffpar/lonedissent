Syllabus.

trary show that the contract of 1868 was materially impaired by the ordinance of 1901 in violation of the provisions of Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution.
The judgment is reversed and the case remandedforfurther
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE DAY concurs in the result on the ground
that the facts stated in the complaint and admitted by
the demurrer raise no presumption that the repeal was
the reasonable exercise of the police power and that
nothing else is necessary to be decided. MR. JUsTICE

SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY v. CITY OF
PORTLAND.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON.
No. 122.

Argued January 6, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1913.

Where, as in this case, a municipal ordinance, granting a franchise to
use streets as authorized by the state .law, expressly reserves to the
city the power to make or alter regulations and to )rohil)it the uv_
of a specified motive power, the grantee cannot accept it and afterwards claim that, as the state law only authorized the designation of
streets, the municipality cannot exert the power reserved to prohibit
the specified motive power without impairing the contract.
Although a municipality cannot defeat a grant made under authority
of the State, it may under the police power reasonably regulate the
method in which it shall be used; such regulations do not defeat the
grant, if it is still practicable to operate under the new regulations.
Railroad Co. v. Richmond, 96 U. S. 521.
The grantee of a franchise to use the streets coupled with conditions
cannot avail of the benefits and deny the validity of the conditions,
or claim that the exercise of the expressly reserved power is a violation of the contract clause of the Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Statement of the Case.

227 U. S,

Where under its reserved powers the municipality attempts to r('gula",e
a franchise to use the streets both as to nalure of motive power and
cars operated, the provisions are separable and do not stand or fall
together. Laclede Gas Co. v. Murphy, 170 U. S. 99.
A franchise given by a municipality under state authority to a railroad
to lay and operate tracks in a street includes the right to haulboth
passenger and freight cars, and a reserved power to regulate cannot
be availed of to prohibit the hauling of freight cars and defeat the
franchise given by the State and to that extent impair the contract
under which the railroad was constructed.
While the'power to regulate a franchise does not authorize a prohibition that destroys it, the municipality may legislate in the light of
facts and conditions.
Whether subsequent regulations impair the obligation of a contract
should only be determined on a complete record; and where, as in
this case, all the conditions were not considered by the court of
original jurisdiction the bill will be dismissed without prejudice.
The ordinance of Portland prohibiting the using of locomotives and
hauling of freight cars on one of its streets occupied by a railr6ad
under a franchise, held not to be an impairment of the contract as
to the locomotives, but not decided on this record, whether it is an
impairment as to the hauling of freight cars.
177 Fed. Rep. 958, affirmed.
APPEAL from a decree refusing to enjoin the City of
Portland from enforcing an ordinance prohibiting the
Southern Pacific Company from running steam locomotives or freight cars along Fourth Street.
It appeared that the Oregon Central R. R. was chartered to build a road from Portland to the California line.
The company thereupon purchased a block of land in the
city on which to locate its terminals and applied to the
Council to designate the street on which the track should
be laid. The general statute of the State then of force
provided (Bellinger & Cotton's Code of Oregon, §§ 5077,
5078) that whenever a private corporation was authorized
to appropriate any part of any public street within the
limits of any town, such corporation should locate their
road upon such particular street as the local authorities
might designate. But if such local authorities refused to

Statement of the Case.

make such designation. within a reasonable time when
requested, such corporation might make such appropriation without reference thereto.
The bill alleges that on January 6, 1869, "under and by
virtue of the laws of the State and its charter then in
effect," the City of Portland duly passed Ordinance 599,
which provided that"SEc. 1. The Oregon -Central Railroad Company, of
Portland, Oregon, is hereby authorized and permitted to
lay a tailway track and run cars over the same along the
center of Fourth Street, from the south boundary line of
the City of Portland, to the north side of G Street, and as
much further north as said Fourth Street may extend or
be extended, upon the terms and conditions as hereinafter
provided."
"SECTION 3.

The Common Council reserve the right
to make or to alter regulations at any time as they deem
proper for the conduct of the said road within the limits
of the city, and the speed of railway cars and locomotives
within said limits, and may restrict or prohibit the running
of locomotives at such time and in such manner as they
may deem necessary."
"SECTION 5. It is -hereby expressly provided that any
refusal or neglect of the said Oregon Central Railroad
Company to comply with the provisions and requirements
of this ordinance, or any other ordinance passed in pursuance'hereof, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the rights
and privileges herein granted; and it shall be lawful for
the Common Council to declare by ordinance, 'the forfeiture of the same, and to cause the said rails to be removed from said street."
The' ordinance was' accepted and the road was built
from the terminals along Fourth to Sheridan Street,
thence south over its private property and.the right, of way

granted by Congress (May 5, 1870, 16 Stat. 94, c. 69) to
McMinnville. From its completion in 1871 to the present
time freight and passenger cars drawn by steam locomotives have been constantly operated along Fdurth Street.
In 1903 the charter of the city of Portland was amended
so as to authorize the granting of street franchises, and
it is alleged that the city desired the railroad to take an
electric franchise, paying therefor an annual sum. It is
further charged that on May 1, 1907, over the protest of
the Railroad Company, the Council passed Ordinance
16491, to go into effect eighteen months after date, by
which it was made unlawful for the Oregon Central, its assigns, their lessees, or any other person to run or operate steam locomotives or freight cars along Fourth
Street . .
between Glisan and the southerly limits
of the city, excepting freight cars for the repair or maintenance of the railway lawfully and rightfully on said
street. Violations were to be punished by fine or imprisonment and deemed a forfeiture of all rights claimed by the
Oregon Central with respect to the operation of the railway on the street. On November 16, 1908, after the expiration of the eighteen months, a proceeding was instituted
in the Municipal Court against the company and one
of its agents, charging that he and it "did wilfully and
unlawfully run and operate steam railway locomotives
along Fourth Street" contrary to the provisions of Ordinance 16491.
The Southern Pacific, a Kentucky corporation, thereupon filed a bill in the United States Circuit Court, alleging that the Oregon Central's property had been transferred to the Oregon & California R. R. and that in 1887
the property and this street right had been leased to the
Southern Pacific, which had since continuously operated
freight and passenger cars with steam power over Fourth
Street.
It averred that the railroad owned no other terminal

Statement of the Case.

property than that purchased in 1869 and reached by the
tracks on Fourth Street; that it was impossible to obtain
any other terminal within the city accessible to the railroad from the intersection of Fourth and Sheridan Streets
to the south boundary; that cars from Corvallis on its line
running south could not be brought into the city and its
business as a common carrier conducted if the ordinance
was enforced, except by constructing, at an estimated
cost of $911,000, about 10 miles of road from Beaverton
to Willsburg, thence across a bridge owned by the Oregon
R. R. & N. Co., and thence by the southern terminus of
said railroad constructed by the Oregon Central. The bill
charged that the ordinance imposed excessive penalties
and illegal forfeitures; that it was arbitrary, unreasonable
and oppressive; deprived the company of property without due process of law; interfered with interstate commerce, and impaired the obligation of the contract under
which the track had been laid in Fourth-Street.
The city answered denying that the Southern Pacific
owned the property and franchises of the Oregon Central,
on the ground that the latter company had no charterright to sell and also offered evidence to show that when
in 1869 the tracks were first laid on Fourth Street, there
were very few buildings thereon, while it was now one
of the principal thoroughfares upon which many stores,
hotels and public structures have been erected; it proved
that the locomotives and cars were much heavier than
those in use when Ordinance 599 was passed and the grade
being steep, the puffing, blowing, exhaust, noise and jar
caused by steam locomotives was more disturbing and injurious than where the line is more nearly level. It also
proved that the Southern Pacific was then building a
Cut-off or Belt Line, by which freight could be carried
around the city instead of being hauled over Fourth
Street.
The court held that under the police power, as well as

that reserved in Ordinance 599, the city could prohibit the
use of steam and the hauling of freight cars, the ordinaice
not being arbitrary in view of the results of hauling locomotives and cars along Fourth Street which hb found was
"quite steep, and the noise, vibration, smoke, cinders and
soot from the moving steam locomotive and train seriously
interfere with the transaction of public and private business, and are a constant source of danger and inconvenience to the public." He made no finding as to whether
the company had other convenient and accessible means
of reaching the terminal, for handling through and local
freight. But having held that the city had power to pass
Ordinance 16491, he'dismissed the bill, and the carrier
appealed.

Evarts were on the brief, for appellant:
The franchise or right granted the Oregon Central
Railroad Company to appropriate and use the portion of
Fourth Street designated in Ordinance No. 599, for the
purpose of constructing and operating its railroad thereon,
is a grant direct from the State and not from the city.
Dillon on Municipal Corporations, 5th ed., §§ 1228, 1230,
1242, 1265-9.
This franchise was granted by the-State of Oregon under
the terms and provisions of §§ 24 and 25 of the act of the
Legislative Assembly of the State of Oregon, passed
October 14,1862, which are now §§ 6841 and 6842 (Lord's
Oregon Laws).
The grant by the State of'this fraichise or right to appropriateand use the part of Fourth street so designated
by Ordinance No. 599 when it,

Ry. & Navig. Co. v. Oregonian Ry. Co., Ltd., 130 U. S. 1.
Ordinance No. 16491 is not within any power reserved
to the city by Ordinance No. 599; nor is it a reasonable
or necessary exercise of any police power of the State or
city regulating the use of the railroad on Fourth street
with a view to the public welfare. Railroad Co. v. Richmond, 67 Virginia, 83; S. C., 96 U. S. 521.
Ordinance No. 16491 is unreasonable and oppressive
and as such operates to defeat the purposes of the grant
from the State, and it is void in that
It impairs the obligation of the contract under which
the street was appropriated by the company and under
which it located and operated its road thereon.
It deprives the company of its property-said franchise-without due process of law and denies it the equal
protection of the laws.
Its enforcement will interfere with, restrain, and prevent the movement by the company of interstate commerce.
Even if it be conceded that the city could, under the
police power, prohibit the use of steam locomotives on
Fourth street, it could not, as it attempted to do under
Ordinance No. 16491, deprive the company of its right,

under reasonable- regulations, to move its freight trains
at some time during the twenty-four hours. Such a
prohibition is a taking of the property of complainant,

If Ordinance No. 16491 be invalid in respect to the

U. S. 1.
MR. JusTiCE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.
The bill alleged that by virtue of the laws of the State
and its charter the City of Portland passed Ordinance 599
permitting cars to be run along Fourth Street. That
ordinance reserved the right "to make and alter regulations" and to "prohibit the running of locomotives."
And as the court held that this reserve power authorized
the city to prohibit the use of stean', the appellant,though originally contending that" Ordinance 599 was
valid and constituted a contract which could not be impaired-now insists that under the law of force in 1869
the city could only "designate" the street on which tracks
could be located and could not, by reservation, give itself
power to prohibit the use of steam or the hauling of freight
cars, nor could it provide for municipal forfeiture of a
state franchise.
1. Under the Oregon Code (§§ 5077, 5078) the power
to designate the street on which railroad tracks could be
located was equivalent to the power to consent to the use
of that street. The city was not limited to merely naming

provided they did not defeat the state franchise--could
fix terms and reserve powers beyond those Wtherwise
possessed by it as a municipality. The specific conditions
aid general powers reserved in § 3 of Ordinance 599 were,
rot inconsistent with the grant from the State, and when,
with such reservation, it was accepted by the company,
it became contractual as well as legislative. The railroad
could not rely on it for the purpose of laying the tracks
and then deny the validity of such conditions. The
Ordinance was proposed and accepted as an entire contract and, as such, was binding on the railroad as well as
on the city. The power therein reserved "to make regulations" coupled with the right "to prohibit the running
of locomotives at such time and in such manner as the
city might deem necessary," authorized, the city to prohibit the use of steam locomotives. This did not defeat
the grant, inasmuch as it was permissible and practicable
to use electricity, gasoline or other motive power free
from' noise and vibration-increased here above the
ordinary when steam was used on a grade said to be one
of the steepest, if not the steepest, in the State. The case
is like Richmond, F. & P. R. Co. v. Richmond, 96 U. S.
521, where, under a somewhat similar ordinance, it was
held that the city might provide that no car or engine
could b drawn or propelled by steam along certain parts
of the highway.
2. The appellant insists, however, that even if the city
can regulate the motive power, it cannot prohibit the
hauling of freight cars, and that the invalidity of this
provision and that forfeiting the franchise renders the
whole Ordinance 16491 void. In reply it is contended
that even if there were no other route than Fourth Street
by which to reach the terminals, it might be necessary for
the railroad to establish a freight depot in another part of
the city and make transfers by other vehicles, rather than
to continue to haul freight cars through Fourth Street;

but that, in any event, the "entire ordinance would not
be void if that portion relating to freight trains were found
to be invalid."
The provisions relating to motive power, prohibiting
the hauling of freight cars and declaring a forfeiture for
a violation of the ordinance are so far separable that they
do not necessarily stand or fall together and, therefore,
the regulation against the use of steam can be enforced
without regard to the validity of the prohibition against
hauling freight cars. Laclede Gas Light Co. v. Murphy,
170 U. S. 78, 99.
3. Even if the city could have contracted for the right
to revoke the State's franchise, the council did not attempt to reserve a power to repeal but only that it
might make and alter regulations, and Ordinance 16491,
whether treated as an exercise of the general police or
special reserve power, recognized that the carrier might
use electricity to haul passenger cars. There is nothing
in that ordinance or in this record which indicates that
there is any difference in result in the operation of the two
classes of cars, or that the company has less right to haul
one than the other. The lessee, and its assignors, as
common carriers were charged with the duty of operating
both, and Ordinance 599 in permitting a railway track to
be laid in Fourth Street expressly authorized cars to be
run thereon. Manifestly that gave the right to the company to transport freight as well as passengers. But if the
city can prohibit the company from operating one set of
,cars it can prevent the use of the other, and under the
power to regulate it could thus defeat the franchise granted
by the State of -Oregon and impair the contract under
which the tracks were located and on the faith of which
the terminals were constructed.
But while the power to regulate does not authorize the
city to prohibit the use of the tracks in hauling freight
cars, it may legislate in. the light of facts and conditions

which would make restrictions reasonable and valid regulations. The extent of the power of the city and the
rights of the company, however, ought not to be finally
adjudicated on this record. For while the ordinance was
attacked as a whole and there was some testimony that
it would be possible to reach the terminals over other
railways and by means of a Belt Line then being constructed for handling through freight, but not finished,
yet the evidence was directed to the injurious consequences resulting from the use of steam and not from
hauling cars. The bill was filed primarily to enjoin the
city from prosecuting the company for running a steam
locomotive. In sustaining the ordinance as a whole the
court called attention to the fact that the street was quite
steep throughout the business district, and the noise,
vibration, cinders and soot from the moving steam locomotive and train seriously interfered with the transaction
of business and were a source of danger and inconvenience
to the public. But nothing appeArs to show that the
noise or danger would be different in character or result
from that caused by the running of other electric cars or
that there was any reason why freight cars should be prohibited when passenger cars were permitted to be run.
The city has the undoubted right to make regulations as
to cars used in the transportation of local freight to and
from the terminal. If, as claimed, the Belt Line, when
completed, will afford convenient and accessible means of
handling through cars without the necessity of going
through Fourth Street, that fact may be given the weight
to which it is entitled when regulations are made. But
those issues were not clearly raised nor specifically ruled
on by the lower court, and the city has neither attempted
to prosecute for hauling freight cars nor attempted to enforce a. forfeiture. These questions ought not to be determined here until such issues have been more definitely
considered by the court of original jurisdiction. -Without

VAN IDERSTINE, TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY
OF FELLERMAN, v. NATIONAL DISCOUNT

COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 136. Argued January 22, 23, 1913.-Decided February 24, 1913.
A general verdict in an equity case to declare a payment to be a fraudulent preference in favor of the trustee, which was only advisory, and
which was practically demanded by the instructions of the court,
cannot be treated as a finding of intent by the bankrupt to defraud,
of which intent defendant had notice.
There is a difference between intent to defraud and intent to preferthe former is malum per se and the latter malum prohibitum and
only to the extent forbidden.
A bonafWe transfer of securities to secure a loan made to one who immediately thereafter becomes a bankrupt is not an illegal preference
where the person making the loan has no knowledge that, the borrower intends to defraud any of his creditors, even though he may
know that the whole or part of the money loaned is to be used to
pay some of his debts.
Where error is assigned in the Circuit Court of Appeals, not only on
refusal of the trial court to set aside the verdict against, but also for
failure to enter a verdict in favor of, defendant, the Circuit Court
of Appeals, if it finds facts justifying such action, may reverse and
order the complaint dismissed.
