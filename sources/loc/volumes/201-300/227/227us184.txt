plying that both contract, and is simply an undertaking
by Graham to paymore in a certain event. There is no
suggestion of agency in it, but, on the contrary, an assumption that Graham is acting on his own behalf. The
answer, although setting up the second point, as to the
effect of the addition, also recognizes the original agreement as a contract of sale and shows very plainly that
calling it an option is an afterthought.
The condition as to the lease to Landrau is admitted
not to be material now. Graham was ready to perform
the conditions imposed upon him. On August 10, 1909,
he accepted a lease of parcels one and two, and this is set
up as an estoppel against him, but it is enough to answer
that the instrument recognized an outstanding dispute as
to the land and provided that the lease should not affect
the rights on either side. So far as the defenses urged go
they point rather to unwillingness to carry out a bargain
than to any reasonable doubt. The most plausible ground
for hesitation is the indefiniteness of the boundaries. But
no such point was taken. It seems to be a common
characteristic of such agreements in Porto Rico, see Veve
v. Sanchez, 226 U. S. 234, 241, and with the aid of local
knowledge the surveyor employed by the court seems to
have had no difficulty in fixing the line.

ERROR TO THE KANSAS

CITY COURT OF APPEALS OF THE

STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 132.

Argued January 21, 22, 1913.-Decided February 3, 1913.

Whether there was a joint liability of defendants sued jointly for negligence is a matter of state law and this court will not go behind the
decision of the highest court of the State to which the question can
go. Southern Railway Co. v. Miller, 217 U. S. 209.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

The motive of the plaintiff in joining defendants taken by itself, does
not affect the right to remove. If there is a joint liability he has a
right to enforce it, whatever his reason may be. Chicago, Burlington
& Quincy Ry. Co. v. Willard, 220 U. S. 413.
The fact that the resident defendant joined in a suit with a rich nonresident corporation is poor does not affect the case, if the cause of
action against them actually be joint.
Whether or not a cause of action was stated against the resident
defendant is a question of state law, and where the -verdict went
against that defendant and was affirmed by the highest court of the
State to which it could go, this court takes the fact as established.
The fact that the declaration was amended after the petition to remove
had been denied held immaterial where, as in this case, it merely
made the original cause of action more precise.
On the question of removal this court need not consider more than
whether there was a real intention to get a joint judgment, and
whether the record showed colorable ground for it when the removal
was denied.*
145 Mo. App. 332, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the right of separate removal
by a non-resident railway company sued jointly with a

resident defendant by an employ6 for damages for negligence, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Paul E. Walker, with whom Mr. F; C. Dillard was
on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
The question for determination in this case is whether
the petition for the removal of the suit to the United
States court should have been allowed.
The controversy between the plaintiff below and the
removing defendant was separable.
No cause of action was stated against either of the
resident defendants. Atlantic Coast Line*R. Co. v. Bailey,

Opinion of the Court.

Co., 147 Fed. Rep. 83, 86; Broadway Ins. Co. v. Railway
Co., 101 Fed. Rep. 510.
Plaintiffs in error, Barrett and Reed, were vice-principals.
Rev. Stat. Missouri, ยง 5435.
Plaintiff in error, Railway Company, waived its petition for removal by filing a separate demurrer to the
petition of the plaintiff below, before any order was made
by the state court with reference to the petition for removal,
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion. of the
court.

This is an action -for personal injuries brought by
Schwyhart against the railway company and those of its
,servants to whose immediate negligence the injuries were
alleged to have been due. There was a verdict and judgment against the company and the defendant Barrett,
but at the proper time a petition had been filed by the
railway company for the removal of the action to the
Circuit Court of the United States, and it now contends
that all subsequent proceedings in the state courts were
void. 145 Mo. App. 332.
The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was employed
by the company as hostler under Barrett as foreman; that
it was his duty under Barrett's direction to uncouple the
air brake and signal hose from between the ends of the
cars on a specified train; that Barrett ordered him to do
so, and that while he was between the cars, owing to their
proceeding in an unusual manner that is stated, he was
crushed; and further that Barrett negligently ordered him
into the dangerous situation without giving him warning
of the danger, and by his order and presence assured the
plaintiff that the work could be proceeded with safely,
when by the exercise of ordinary care on Barrett's part
the injury could have been avoided. After the petition

CHICAGO, R. I. & PAC. RY. v. SCHWYHART.

193

Opinion of the Court.

for removal had been overruled the declaration was
amended by inserting as to Barrett 'although he well
knew of plaintiff's danger and the unusual way by which
the said Pullman car was to be switched.'
The defendants other than the railway were residents of
Missouri, and the petition for removal charged that they
were joined for the sole and fraudulent purpose of preventing a removal. The grounds stated for the charge
of fraudulent joinder were that the declaration disclosed.
no cause of action against those defendants, that the company and they were not jointly liable, and that they were
persons of little or no property, while the,-company was
fully able to pay. It will be sufficient to consider these
grounds with reference to Barrett alone, the party that
ultimately was held.
The joint liability of the defendants under the declaration as amended is a matter of state law, and upon that
we shall not attempt to go behind the decision of the
highest court of the State before which the question could
come. Southern Ry. Co. v. Miller, 217 U. S. 209, 215, 216.
That court might hold that the declaration averred the
plaintiff to have been led by Barrett into a trap that was
set and snapped by the company, the latter being also
liable for Barrett's share in the deed. Again, the motive of
the plaintiff, taken by itself, does not affect the right to
remove. If there is a joint liability he has an absolute
right to enforce it, whatever the reason that makes him
wish to assert the right. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy
Ry. Co. v. Willard, 220 U. S. 413, 427. Illinois Central R.
R. Co. v. Sheego#j 215 U. S. 308, 316. Hence the fact that
the company is rich and Barrett poor does not affect the
case.
The remaining justification for the charge of fraudulent
intent is that no cause of action was stated against Barrett. That again is a question of state law, and that the
plaintiff had such a cause of action in fact must be taken

now to be established. The suggestion that mere nonfeasance is alleged is shown to be unfounded by the statement that we have made. It is true that the declaration
was amended after the petition to remove had been
denied, but the amendment if not unnecessary merely
made the original cause of action more precise. On the
question of removal we have not to consider more than
whether therewas a real intention to get a joint judgment
and whether there was a colorable ground for it shown as
the
record stood when the removal was denied. We are
not to
decide whether a flaw colld be picked in the declaration on special demurrer. As the record stood Barrett was
alleged negligently to have Ordered the plaintiff into a
dangerous place and by his conduct to have assured the
plaintiff of safety, when if Barrett had used ordinary care
the plaintiff need not have been hurt. To add that Barrett knew the specific source of the danger is merely to
make plainer what evidently was meant before.
Judgment affirmed.
