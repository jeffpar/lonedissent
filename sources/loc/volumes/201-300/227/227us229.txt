SCOTT v. LATTIG.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF JDAYdO.

No. 86.

Argued December 13, 1912.-Decided Webruicy 3, 1913.

An error in omitting an island in a navigable stream does not divest
the United States of the title or interpose any obstacle to surveying
it at a later time.
Purchasers of fractional interests of subdivisions on the bank of a
navigable stream do not acquire title to an island on the other side
of the channel merely because the island was omitted from the
survey.
Lands underlying navigable waters within the several States belong
to the respective States in virtue of their sovereignty, subject to the
paramount power of Congress to control navigation between the
States and with foreign powers.
Each new State, upon its admission to the Union, becomes endowed
with the same rights and powers in regard to sovereignty over lands
under navigable waters as the older States.
An island within the public domain in a navigable stream and actually
in existence at the time of the survey of the banks of the stream, and
also in existence when the State within which it was situated is admitted to the Union, remains property of the United States, and
even though omitted from the survey it does not become part of
the fractional subdivisions on the opposite bank of the stream; and
so held as to an island in Snake River, Idaho.
United States v.
Mission Rock Co., 189 U. S. 391, followed; Whitaker v. McBride,
197 U. S. 510, distinguished.
17 Idaho, 506, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the title to an island in a navigable river and whether it remained public land after the
survey, are stated in the opinion.

Public grants convey nothing by implication; they are
to be strictly construed against the grantee, contrary to
the usual policy of the law in the consideration of grants.
Nothing passes by a public grant but that which is necessarily or expressly embraced in its terms. United States

Whenever the question in any court, state or Federal, is
whetlher the title to land which has once been the property
of the United States has passed from the Federal Government, that question must be resolved by the laws of the
United States. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 517;

Congress alone has, under Art. IV, ยง 3 of the Constitution, the power to determine the manner of disposing of
the public lands, and it has the sole power to declare the
dignity and effect of titles emanating from the United

The United States holds the title to the beds, below
high water mark, of the navigable streams within a Territory for the benefit of the whole people, and in trust for
the State or States to be ultimately created out of such
'Territory. Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 28; Weber v.

Grants by Congress of portions of the public lands
within a Territory to settlers thereon, though bordering
on or bounded by navigable waters, convey of their own
force title to the upland only, or what lies above ordinary
high water mark. And such grants do not impair the
title and dominion of the future State, when created, to the
bed of the stream below ordinary high water mark.

The use of the shores of navigable streams and the
right, title or interest of riparian proprietors, or the
owners of the upland, to such shores and to the beds of the
streams must be determined by the laws of the several
States, subject only to the rights vested by the Constitution in the United States. Shively v. Bowiby, supra; St.

The courts of the United States will construe the grants
of the general Government without reference to the rules
of construction adopted by the States for their grants, but
whatever incidents or rights to the soil under navigable
waters, or below high water mark,,attach to the.ownership
of the upland conveyed by the Government will be determined by the States, subject to the condition that their

Whether a riparian owner holds title in fee to the center
of a navigable stream, or to low water mark or high water
mark must be determined by the laws of the State in
which the upland is situated. McGilvra v. Ross and
Shively v. Bowlby, supra.
The title to the bed and shores of non-navigable streams
is vested in the owner of the upland, and where the opposite banks of a stream, not navigable, belong to different
persons the stream and the bed thereof is common to both.

The owner in fee of the bed of the river, or other submerged land, is the owner of any bar, island or dry land
which may be subsequently formed thereon. St. Louis v.
Rutz, 138 U. S. 226.
Islands formed in the stream before the admission of
the State into the Union are subject to disposal by the
Federal Government the same as other public lands. If
they are formed after the admission of the State, the
question whether they belong to the riparian owner, or
are the property of the State, is governed by local law.

One receiving a patent for the full acreage of' upland
paid for will not be heard to insist that, by reason of the
failure of the surveyor to note on the official plat the existence of an island of 138.15 acres of agricultural land, not
subject to overflow, and situated across a 400 foot channel
from the upland, he is entitled to the island also. Cases

An island in existence at the time of the admission of
the State into the Union, consisting of 138.15 acres of
dry land not subject to overflow and adapted to ordinary
agricultural uses, is not part of the river bed, and title
thereto does not pass by implication or legal intendment
to either the State or the riparian owner, but it may be
claimed, surveyed and sold by the Government as other
public lands. See Re Peterson; Steinbuchel v. Lane and
Shoemaker v. Hatch, supra.
The Government as the original proprietor has the right
to survey and sell any lands, including islands in the rivers
or other bodies of water; and the failure of the surveyor
to show an island on the official plat does not estop the
Government from claiming it when its attention is directed
to it. Cases supra.
Whether an island is open to homestead entry and settlement, and should therefore be surveyed, is a matter within

The Land Department is a tribunal appointed by Congress to decide certain questions- relating to the public
lands; and its decision upon matters of fact cognizable by
it, in the absence of fraud or imposition, is conclusive
everywhere else. Lee v. Johnson, 116 U. S. 48; Marquez v.

The Land Department in issuing a patent must necessarily consider and pass upon the qualifications of the applicant, the acts he has performed to secure the title, the
nature of the land, and whether it is of the class which is
open to sale. Its judgment upon these matters is that of a
special tribunal, and, is unassailable except by direct proceedings for its annulment or limitatiQn. Steel v. St. Louis

A decision rendered by the officers of the Land Department upon a question of fact is conclusive and not subject
to be reviewed by the courts in the absence of a showing
that such decision was rendered in consequence of fraud or
imposition or mistake other than an error of judgment in

whether or not it was consistent with the preponderance
of the evidence, so long as there is some evidence upon
which the finding in question could be made. Hartwell v.

Courts will not entertain an inquiry as to the extent of
the investigation by the Secretary of the Interior and his
knowledge of the points involved in his decision of a contest in the Land Department, nor as to the methods by
which he reached his determination. De Cambra v.
Rogers, 189 U. S. 119.
When the Land Department accepted the application
of plaintiff in error for a survey of the island in qtestion
and directed that said island be surveyed, platted and
offered for sale as public land, it held in effect that it had
not been the intention of the Government to surrender its
title to said island under the patents to defendants in error,
or their predecessors in interest, for the fractional lots
situated across the channel from the island. And the
decision of the Department on those questions has become
res adjudicata, at least so far as the power of that Department extends. In re Peterson, 39 L. D. 566; Case v. Church,

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was a suit in the District Court of Canyon County,
Idaho, to quiet the title to Poole Island in the Snake river.
The plaintiff, Lattig, claimed the northern part by reason
of his ownership of lands on the east bank of the river and
rested his claim to the southern part upon adverse possession. One. of the defendants, Scott, claimed the entire
island under the homestead law of the United States, and
the other defendant, Green, claimed the southern part by
reason of his ownership of lands on the east bank of the
river, adjoining those of Lattig. Following a trial of the
issues, a decree was entered sustaining Lattig's claim to
the northern part and Green's to the southern, and quiet-.
ing their titles against the claim of Scott. The Supreme
Court of the State affirmed the decree, 17 Idaho, 506, and
the case was then brought here.
The material facts are as follows: Snake river is a navigable stream and at the place in question is the boundary
between the States of Oregon and Idaho. It flows northward past Poole Island in two channels, one on either side,
and has a fall of 6 feet from one end of the island to the

other. The channel on the western or Oregon side is
about 1,000 feet wide, and the one on the eastern or Idaho
side is approximately 300 feet. The island is on the Idaho
side of the thread of the stream, is over a mile in length,
is from 500 to 1,200 feet in width, and has an area of
138.15 acres. It has well-defined banks extending from
3 to 5 feet above high water, is mostly covered with a
growth of wild grass, sage brush and small timber, bears
undoubted evidence of permanency and of having been
there many years, and concededly was in the same condition as now in 1880, which was several years before Idaho
was admitted into the Union and before the lands on theeast bank of the river passed into private ownership.
Those lands were surveyed in 1868, and the field notes
and plat of the survey showed that the bank on that side
of the river was meandered in the usual way and that the
sections and subdivisions bordering thereon were fractional. The island was not mentioned in the field notes or
plat. Lattig and Green severally own the fractional sub-.
divisions on the east bank opposite the island under
United States patents issued in 1894 and 1895, which
describe them as containing 73.30 and 98.75 acres, respectively, "according to the official plat of the survey of
said lands returned to the General Land Office by the
surveyor general."
The northern part of the island,
which is opposite the lands of Lattig, contains 54.75 acres,
and the southern part, which is opposite the lands of
Green, contains 83.40 acres. Scott settled upon the island,
as unsurveyed public land, in the early part of 1904, with
the purpose of acquiring the title under the homestead
law of the United States (see act May 14, 1880, 21 Stat.
141, c. 89, ยง 3; Rev. Stat., ยง 2266), and has ever since
resided on and occupied the island and improved and cultivated portions of it. In 1906 it was surveyed a5 public
land by direction of the Commissioner of the General Land
Office, and after this survey was, appro'ed and the plat

Opinion of the Court.

filed Scott tendered, in the regular way at the proper land
office, an application to enter .the island as a homestead
in virtue of his prior settlement, and the application was
duly accepted. It is said in the brief in his behalf that
after the trial in the District Court his homestead claim
was carried to-completion and a patent was issued to him,
but as this is not shown on the record it may be passed
without other notice.
As it is manifest that the island, if in existence at the
time of the survey in 1868, was then public land of the
United States, and also that, if it continued to be public
land in 1904, Scott initiated and acquired a valid claim
to it under the homestead law, we will come at once to the
reasons advanced for holding, as did the state court, that
it ceased to be public land before 1904, viz., its omission
from the survey of 1868, the admission of Idaho as a State
in .[890, and the disposal of the lands on the east bank of
the river in 1894 and 1895.
In making the survey of 1868 it was the duty of the
surveyor, if the island was there at the time, to ascertain
its exact location, to meander its exterior boundary, and
to enter both in the field notes (Manual of Surveying
Instructions of 1855, pp. 12-14; Act of May 30, 1862, 12
Stat. 409, c. 86), and therefore the absence of such an
entry, as also of any representation of the island on the
plat constructed from the field notes, naturally suggests
that the island may not then have been in existence. But
this suggestion is effectually refuted by the size, elevation
and appearance of the island, the character and extent
of the vegetation thereon, and the conceded fact that in
1880, only 12 years after the survey, it was in the same
condition as now. That it was there at the time of the
survey seems certain, although that is not so important as
its existence when Idaho became a State. Of course, the
error in onitting it from the survey did not divest the
United States of the title or interpose any obstacle to surVOL. ccxxvii-16

veying it at a later time. Neither was the error calculated
to induce purchasers of the fractional subdivisions on the
east bank to believe that by paying for the 73.30 and 98.75
acres in those tracts they would get, respectively, 54.75
and 83.40 acres more on the island on the other side of
the 300-foot channel. Home v. Smith, 159 U. S. 40; Niles
v. Cedar Point Club, 175 U. S. 300, 306.

Coming to the effect to be given to the admission of
Idaho as a State and to the disposal of the fractional subdivisions on the east bank, it is well to repeat that Snake
river is a navigable stream, for there is an" important
difference between navigable and non-navigable waters
in such a connection. Thus, Rev. Stat., ยง 2476; which is
but a continuation of early statutes on the subject (Acts
May 18, 1796, 1 Stat. 468, c. 29, ยง 9; March 3, 1$03,
2 Stat. 229, c. 27, ยง 17), declares: "All navigable rivers,
within the territory occupied by the public lands, shall
remain and be deemed public highways; and, in all cases
where the opposite banks .of any streams not navigable
belong to different persons, the stream and the bed thereof
shall become common to both;" and of this provision it
was said in Railroad Company v. Schurmeir, 7 Wall. 272,
288, "the court does not hesitate to decide, that Congress,
in making a distinction between streams navigable and
those not navigable, intended to provide that the common
law rules of riparian ownership should apply to lands
bordering on the latter, but that the title to lands bordering on navigable streams should stop at the stream, and
that all such streams should be deemed to be, and remain
public highways." Besides, it was settled long ago by
this court, upon a consideration of the relative rights and
powers of the Federal and state governments under the
Constitution, that lands underlying navigable waters
within the several States belong to the respective States
in virtue of their sovereignty and may be used and disposed of as they may direct, subject always to the rights

of the public in such waters and to the paramount power
of Congress to control their navigation so far as may be
necessary for the regulation of commerce among the
States and with fbreign nations, and that each new State,
upon its admission to the Union, becomes endowed with
the same rights and powers in this regard as the older
ones. County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68;
Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338; Illinois Central
Railroad Co. v. Illinois, 146 U. S. 387, 434-437; Shively v.
Bowlby, 152U. S. 1,48-50,58; McGilvrav. Ross, 215 U. S. 70.
Bearing in mind, then, that Snake river is a navigable
streami it is apparent, first, that on the admission of Idaho
to statehood the ownership of the bed of the river on the
Idaho side of the thread of the stream-the thread being
the true boundary of the State-passed from the United
States to the State, subject to the limitations just indicated, and, second, that the subsequent disposal by the
former of the fractional subdivisions on the east bank
carried with it no right to the bed of the river, save as the
law of Idaho may have attached such a right to private
riparian ownership. This is illustrated by the statement
in Hardin v. Shedd, 190 U. S. 508, 519: "When land is
conveyed by the United States bounded on a non-navigable
lakq belonging to it, the grounds for the decisiofi must be
quite different from the considerations affecting a conveyance of land bounded on navigable water. In the latter
case the land under the water does not belong to the
United States, but has passed to the State by its admission to the Union. . . . When land under navigable water passes to the riparian proprietor, along with
the grant of the shore by the United States, it does not
pass by force of the grant alone, because the United States
does not own it, but it passes by force of the declaration
of the State which does own it that it is attached to the
shore." United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 209 U. S.
447, 451, is to the same effect.

But the island, which we have seen was in existence
when Idaho became a State, was not part of the bed of
the stream or land under the water, and therefore its
ownership did not pass to the State or come within the
disposing influence of its laws. On the contrary, although
surrounded by the waters of the river and widely separated
from the shore, it was fast dry land, and therefore remained
the property of the United States and subject to disposal
under its laws, as did the island which was in controversy in
Mission Rock Co. v. United States, 109 Fed. Rep. 763, 769770, and United States v. Mission Rock Co,, 189 U. S. 391.
We think the cases relied upon by the defendants in
error do not make for a contrary conclusion. Railroad
Company v. Schurineir, 7 Wall. 288, expressly recognizes
"that proprietors of lands bordering on navigable rivers,
Under titles derived from the, United States, hold only to
the stream." In Grand.Rapids & Indiana Railroad Co. v.
Butler, 159 U. S. 87, the evidence left it uncertain whether
the so-called island was more than "a low sand bar, covered a good part of the year with water," at the time of
the survey of the adjacent lands, which was in the year of
the State's admission to the Union, and the court said
(p. 95): "We have no doubt upon the evidence that. the
circumstances were such at the time of the survey as naturally induced the surveyor to decline to survey this
particular spot as an island. There is nothing to indicate
United. States v. Chandler-Dunbar
mistake or fraud."
Co., 209 U. S. 447, 451, is sufficiently distinguished by the
following excerpt from the opinion: "The islands are
little more than rocks rising very slightly above the level
of the water, and contain respectively a small fraction of
ain acre and a little more than an acre. They were unsurveyed and of no apparent value. We cannot think that
these provisions excepted such islands from the admitted
transfer to the State of the bed of the streams surrounding
them." And Whitaker v. McBride, 197 U. S. 510, which

Syllabus.

related to a small island, in a non-navigable river, which
the Land Department of the United States had expressly
refused to survey, requires no other notice than to quote
the following from the opinion (p. 515): "It must also be
noticed that the Government is not a party to this litigation, and nothing we have said is to be construed as a
determination of the power of the Government to order a
survey of this island or of the rights which would result
in case it did make such survey. . . . Our conclusion,
therefore, is that by the law of Nebraska, as interpreted
by its highest court, the riparian proprietors are the owners
of the bed of a stream to the center of the channel; that
the Government, as original proprietor, has the right to
survey and sell any lands, including islands in a river or
other body of water; that if it omits to survey an island
in a stream and refuses, when its attention is called to
the matter, to make any survey thereof, no citizen can
overrule the action of the Department, assume that the
island ought to have been surveyed, and proceed to occupy
it for the purposes of homestead or preemption entry. In
such a case the rights of riparian proprietors are to be preferred to the claims of the settler."
For the reasons given the decree is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent
-with this opinion.
Reversed.
