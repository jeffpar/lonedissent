HEIKE v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CiRCUIT.

No. 520.

Argued January 9, 1913.-Decided January 27, 1913.

There is a clear distinction between an amnesty for crime committed
and the constitutional protection under the Fifth Amendment from
being compelled to be a witness against oneself.
The obvious purpose of the act of February 25, 1903, c. 755, 32 Stat.
854, 904, granting to witnesses in investigations of violations of the
Sherman Act immunity against prosecution for matters testified to,
was to obtain evidence that otherwise could not be obtained; the
act was not intended as a gratuity to crime, and is to be construed,
as far as possible, as coterminous with the privilege of the person
concerned.
Evidence given in an investigation under the Sherman Act does not
make a basis under the act of February 25, 1903, for immunity of the
witness against prosecutions for crimes with which the matters
testified about were only remotely connected.
Granting a separate trial to one of several jointly indicted for c,,nspiracy is within the discretion of the trial judge, reviewable only
in case of abuse.
Even if'there may have been an abuse in some instances of indicting
under § 5440 for conspiracy instead of for the substantive crime itself.
liability for conspiracy is not taken away by its success, and in a case
such as this, there does not appear to be any abuse.
Evidence showing that a conspiracy had continued before and after
the periods specified in the indictment, held in this case not inadmissible against a defendant present at the various times testified to.
192 Fed. Rgp. 83, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve, the extent of immunity
granted under the act of February 25, 1903, c. 755, 32
Stat. 854, 904, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. John B. Stanchfield, with whom Mr. George S.
Graham and Mr. Frederick Allis were on the brief, for
petitioner:

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Argument for Petitioner.

227 U. S.

The immunity statute herein pleaded in bar is a grant
of amnesty from the sovereign, operating by way of a pardon from the Government. It bears no analogy, either in
conditions of acquirement or in mode of operation, to the
constitutional privilege of the Fifth Amendment.
There is a fundamental distinction between the constitutional privilege and the statutory immunity. It is apparent on the very face thereof.
The first proceeds upon the theory of a shield against
compulsory self-incrimination, given by sovereign to
citizen.
The second proceeds upon the theory of a pardon or
amnesty, given by the Government to the citizen.
Even if the immunity.should receive a strict and narrow
construction because it is "in derogation of the sovereign
power to punish," and public policy may favor a narrow,
and is opposed to a broad, view of the immunity provision, on the other hand, the pardon theory of immunity
affords a complete refutation of any narrow rule of construction, and public policy requires a broad construction
of the immunity provision.
The plain language of the statute itself shows that it
confers general amnesty, and should operate as a pardon,
and not in the way the old constitutional privilege does.
See act of January 24, 1862, § 103, Rev. Stat.; § 859, Rev.
Stat.; act of January 24, 1862, c. 11, 12 Stat. 333; § 860,
Rev. Stat.; act of February 25, 1868, c. 13, § 1; 15 Stat. 37;
act of February 11, 1893, 27 Stat. 443; Counselman v.
Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591.
The absurdity and impossibility of imposing all the
conditions and limitations of the constitutional privilege
shows that the immunity statute was intended to operate
as a grant of amnesty or pardon.
The public policy of the statute shows that it should
operate as a grant of amnesty or pardon. United States
v. Armour, 142 Fed. Rep. 819, 826.

HEIKE v. UNITED STATES.
227 U. S.

Argument for Petitioner.

The weight of authority shows that the immunity statute is an act of general amnesty, and therefore should
operate as a pardon from the Government. Brown v.
Walker, 161 U. S. 591; Burrell v. Montana, 194 U. S. 572,
578; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 67; United States v.
Price, 96 Fed. Rep. 962; United States v. Swift, 186 Fed.
Rep. 1002. State v. Murphy, 107 N. W. Rep. 470, distinguished.
The pardon or amnesty theory of the immunity statute
affords a complete refutation (1) of every argument advanced by the Government, (2) of every ground for the
opinion of the learned trial court, save one, (3) and of
every ground assigned by the learned Court of Appeals
without exception, in opposition to the plea in bar herein.
The authorities cited by the Government for its contentions, or those of the court below, are not in point, if the
immunity statute be treated as a statute of amnesty.
There are but three cases in which the witness has
pleaded the immunity statute in bar to a prosecution.
United States v. Armour, 142 Fed. Rep. 808; United States
v. Swift, 186 Fed. Rep. 1002; State v. Murphy, 107 N. W.
Rep. 470.
It would seem to follow from this review of cited cases,
none of which support the contention of the Government
that the immunity statute of 1903 is merely a defense
against self-incrimination, requiripS to be pleaded as a
privilege, and extending no further than the exclusion of
testimony given; nor anything against the contention that
the statute grants general amnesty to witnesses, as this
court has said, operating in every case to which it is applicable, ex proprio vigore as a pardon does.
The petitioner's former testimony was "concerning"
the "transaction, matter or thing" on account of which
he is being prosecuted, within the meaning of the statute;
although the particular offence for which he has been indicted was not the direct subject of the inquiry at which

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Argument for Petitioner.

227 U. S.

he testified, yet it was incidentally discovered, led up to
and prosecuted by means of his testimony.
The word "concerning" should receive the broadest
possible construction. Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 623;
United States v. Burr, 25 Fed. Cas. 40; Counselman v.
Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 564, 562; Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 67;
Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 629; People v. Forbes,
143 N. Y. 219, 228; Am. Lithographic Co. v. Werckmeister,
221 U. S. 603, 611.
Whether or not the immunity statute should receive a
broad application is a political question, and the policy
adopted by Congress is final and binding on all.
Public policy is a political question, and it is the
province of Congress, in the first place, to determine the
public policy of every statute it enacts. Pennsylianiav.
Wheeling, 18 How. 440; Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12
Pet. 737, 738; Luther v. Borden, .7 How. 42; William v.
Suffolk &c., 13 Pet. 420; Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253;

Cas..550; United States v. Armour, 142 Fed. Rep. 826.
The pleadings, on the plea in bar, afforded sufficient
evidence on the question of relevancy to make it error to
direct the verdict on the special trial of the plea.
The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding that
petitioner was entitled to no immunity because he was
subpoenaed and testified as an officer of the corporation
under investigation at the anti-trust proceeding, where he
gave the evidence he now relies on. State v. 'Nowell, 58
N. H. 314; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 602; Hale v. Henkel,

The court below erred in denying the motion of the
defendant Heike for a separate trial. He was unlawfully

prejudiced by being tried together with the other defendants.
No man can receive a fair trial if he is forced to stand in
a background of fraud and knavery created by the acts
of others but which necessarily throw their dubious gloom
over his own conduct and impart a sinister significance to
his most innocent acts. White v.. The People, 81 Illinois,
338; State v. Oxendine, 107 Nor. Car. 783.
In addition, the defendant was greatly prejudiced by
the fact that during the course of the trial three of the
other defendants pleaded guilty. This turn of events
should, it is submitted, have induced the court to grant to
the defendant Heike a separate trial. United States v.
Matthews, Fed. Cas. No. 15741b; Krause v. United States,
147 Fed. Rep. 444.
While the lower court had discretion upon the motion
for a severance, United States v. Marchant, 12 Wheat.
480; United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, it does not follow,
however, that the granting or denial of the motion is not
subject to review by this court. O'Connell v. Pennsylvania Co., 118 Fed. Rep. 991; Osborne v. The Bank, 9
Wheat. 738, 8(6; Krause v. United States, 147 Fed. Rep.

It was error to convict petitioner on the sixth count, for
conspiracy.
It,has l)ecome customary for prosecutors to charge
conspiracy rather thin the commission of actual crime,
in their indictments, especially statutory crimes of the
(.lass uder consi(ler.ation. Although relying on the same
evidence, they find it easier to convince a jury of secret
conspirawy than of a palpable crime; it opens the (oor to
metaphysical speculation in place of dry proof; the in(uiry'\

conspiracy in the minds of the conspirators without overt
acts to show it. This is abuse. See United States v.
Kissel, 173 Fed. Rep. 823, 828; Wharton's Criminal Law,
§ 1402.
The circumstantial evidence, from which alone the
jury inferred petitioner's participation in and knowledge
of the frauds in question, was not legally sufficient for
th~ose pirposes; the learned trial court erred in allowing
the jury to draw such inference, and the learned Court
of Appeals erred in affirming the judgment in that
respect.
The learned trial court committed reversible error in
admitting in evidence the so-called "pink books." Chicago

ordinary error, violated the right of accused to be co'nfronted with the witnesses against him. United States

227 U. S.

Argument for the United States.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison, with whom
Mr. Henry L. Stimson and Mr. Felix Frankfurter were on
the brief, for the United States:
The plea of immunity was not well founded. Hale v.
Henkel, 201 U. S. 43, 69; Brown v.- Walker, 161 U. S. 591;
United States v. Swift, 186 Fed. Rep. 1002; United States v.
Armour, 142 Fed. Rep. 808; State v. Murphy, 128 Wisconsin, 201; State v. Warner, 13 Lea (Tenn.), 52, 62-64;
In re Kittle, 180 Fed. Rep. 946, 948 (So. Dist., N. Y.);
United States v. Kimball, 117 Fed. Rep. 156, 163, 166, 168.
The immunity provisions are statutes in derogation of
essential governmental powers, and as such should not be
extended beyond the purpose of their enactment. Louisyille Railway v. Kentucky, 161 U. S. 677, 685; United
States v. Burr, 25 Fed. Cas., pp. 39-40; Hale v. Henkel,
supra; American Lithographic Company v. Werckmeister.
221 U. S.603; Wigmore on Evidence, § 2192.
The purpose of the immunity statutes, as shown by
their structure and their historical evolution, was to
prevent the obstruction of the specified prosecutions by
the exercise of the constitutional privilege. This purpose was accomplished by an exchange of immunity for
the privilege. There is nothing either in the terms of
the act or its history to indicate any intention of granting
a bonus in addition to this exchange.
The form of the act of February 11, 1893, is a balance
indicating an exchange. The clause beginning "But" is
in relation to and a plain exchange for the clause which
withdraws the "excuse" from testifying on the ground
of incrimination.
Also the word "concerning" indicates a real connection
with a crime analogous to the connection which would
raise the privilege.
The theory of petitioner's brief, that the purpose of
Congress was to "encourage volunteer witnesses" and
to" persuade" them to testify, by giving them "'a reward"

of absolution from all crimes, has nothing whatever to
base itself on. It was repudiated by Judge Carpenter
in the Swift Case, supra, and by Wigmore in the passage
quoted, supra.
Congress has been exceedingly conservative in the enactment of statutes granting immunity. Instead of passing a general immunity statute, it has gone step by step,
granting no greater immunity than was necessary for the
enforcement of the various commerce laws. Section 860
of the Revised Statutes; Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142
U. S. 547; act of February 11, 1893 (27 Stat. 443, see

States v. Kimball, supra.
No possible public policy calls for an extension of the
immunity statute to the giving of innocent evidence not
protected by the constitutional privilege. State v. Murphy,
supra.
None of the evidence adduced by Heike was incriminating, and none of it could have been withheld by him under
the constitutional privilege. United States v. Burr, supra;

The immunity statutes do not grant immunity excepting for offenses under the acts to which they refer. As to
evidence tending to incriminate a witness of other offenses
entirely unrelated to such acts, he still retains the consti-

The admission of the so-called "pink books" on the
trial of the plea of not guilty was not error.
An unnecessarily complete foundation was laid for these
books. Chicago Lumbering Co. v. Hewitt, 64 Fed. Rep.

matter of the present indictment and that therefore he
was exempted from liability by the act of February 25,
1903, c. 755, 32 Stat. 854, 904, as amended June 30, 1906,
c. 3920, 34 Stat. 798. There was a replication; issue was
joined; a trial was had upon the plea, in which the court
directed a verdict for the Government, 175 Fed. Rep. 852;
leave was given to plead over; a premature attempt was
made to bring the case before this court, 217 U. S. 423, and
then there was a trial on the merits in which the petitioner
was found guilty on the sixth count. The Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment, 192 Fed. Rep. 83, 112
C. C. A. 615. Whereupon a writ of certiorari was granted
by this court.
The investigation in which the petitioner testified concerned transactions of the American Sugar Refining Company. See Pennsylvania Sugar Refining Co. v. American
Sugar Refining Co., 166 Fed. Rep. 254. The petitioner was
summoned to produce records of the American Sugar Refining Company and to testify. He appeared, produced
the records and testified that he was the person to whom
the subpoenas were addressed, secretary of the New York
corporation and secretary and treasurer of the New Jersey
corporation of the same name. He summed up what the
books-produced showed as to the formation of the New
York company. He identified his signature to four checks
of the company in a transaction not in question here-the
Kissel-Segal loan mentioned in United States v. Kissel, 218
U. S. 601, 608. These checks were not used in the present
case. He testified as to the ownership of the Havemeyer
and Elder Refinery in Brooklyn. Finally he produced a
table showing how many pounds of sugar were melted
each year from 1887 to 1907 in each refinery, this table of
course not purporting to represent the petitioner's personal
knowledge, but being a summary of reports furnished by
the company's different employ~s, and, the Government
contends, volunteered by him.

HEIKE v. UNITED STATES.
227 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The act of February 25, 1903, c. 755, 32 Stat. 854, 904,
appropriates $500,000 for the enforcement of the Interstate Commerce and Anti-Trust Acts, "Provided, that no
person shall be prosecuted or be subjected to any penalty
or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter,
or thing concerning whici he may testify or produce
evidence, documentary or otherwise, in any proceeding,
suit, or prosecution under said Acts; Provided further,
that no person so testifying shall be exempt from prosecution or punishment for perjury committed in so testifying." (This last proviso was added only from superfluous
caution and throws no light on the construction. Glickstein v. United States, 222 U. S. 139, 143, 144.) By the
amendment of June 30, 1906, c. 3920, 34 Stat. 798,
immunity under the foregoing and other provisions
"shall extend only to a natural person who, in obedience
to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces
evidence, documentary or otherwise, under oath."
The petitioner contended that, as soon as he had testified
upon a matter under the Sherman Act, he had an amnesty
by the statute from liability for any and every offence
that was connected with that matter in any degree, or,
at least, every offence towards the discovery of which
his testimony led up, even if it had no actual effect in
bringing the discovery about. At times the argument
seemed to suggest that any testimony, although not
incriminating, if relevant to the later charge, brought
the amnesty into play. In favor of the broadest construc-

tion of the immunity act, it is argued that when it was
passed there was an imperious popular demand that the
inside working of the trusts should be investigated, and
that the people and Congress cared so much to secure
the necessary evidence that they were willing that some
guilty persons should escape, as that reward was necessary
to the end. The Government on the other hand maintains that the statute should be limited as nearly as may

be by the boundaries of the constitutional privilege of
which it takes the place.
Of course there is a clear distinction between an amnesty
and the constitutional protection of a party from being
compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against
himself. Amendment V. But the obvious purpose of
the statute is to make evidence available and compulsory
that otherwise could not be got. We see no reason for
supposing that the act offered a gratuity to crime. It
should be construed, so far as its words fairly allow the
construction, as coterminous with what otherwise would
have been the privilege of the person concerned. We
believe its policy to be the same as that of the earlier act
of February 11, 1893, c. 83, 27 Stat. 443, which read
"No person shall be excused from attending and testifying," &c. "But no person shall be prosecuted," &c.,
as, now, thus showing the correlation between constitutional right and immunity by the form. That statute was
passed because an earlier one, in the language of a late
case, 'was not coextensive with the constitutional privilege.' American LithographicCo. v. Werckmeister, 221 U. S.
603, 611. Compare act of February 19, 1903, c. 708,
§ 3, 32 Stat. 847, 848. To illustrate, we think it plain
t hat merely testifying to his own name, although the
faut is relevant to the present indictment as well as to
the previous investigation, was not enough to give the
petitioner the benefit of the act. See 3 Wiginore, Evidence, § 2261.
'here is no need to consider exactly how far the parallelism should be carried. It is to be noticed that the testimony most relied upon was the summary made from the
books of the company by its servants, at the petitioner's
direction, and simply handed over by him ; that ),part
from the statute the petitioner could not have prevented
the production of the books or papers of the company,
such as the sununary was when made, or refused it if

he had the custody of them, and that the decisions that,
established the duty to produce go upon the absence
of constitutional privilege, not upon the ground of statutory immunity in such a case. Wilson v. United States,
221 U. S. 361, 377 et seq. Dreier v. United States, 221 U.
S. 394, 400. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. Interstate
Commerce Commission, 221 U. S. 612, 623. Wheeler v.
United States, 226 U. S. 478. Grant v. United States,
ante, p. 75. But this consideration does not stand alone,
for the evidence given in the former proceeding did not
concern the present one and had no such tendency to
incriminate the petitioner as to have afforded a ground
for refusing to give it, even apart from the statute and
the fact that it came from the corporation books. Taking
all these considerations together we think it plain that
the petitioner could take nothing by his plea.
The evidence did not concern any matter of the present charge.
Not only was the general subject of the
former investigation wholly different, but the specific
things testified to had no connection with the facts now
in proof much closer than that they all were dealings
of the same sugar company. The frauds on the revenue
were accomplished by a secret introduction of springs
into some of the scales in such a way as to diminish the
apparent weight of some sugar imported from abroad.
The table of meltings by the year had no bearing on the
frauds, as it was not confined to the sugar fraudulently
weighed and it does not appear how the number of pounds
was made up. The mere fact that a part of the sugar
embraced in the table was the sugar falsely weighed
did not make the table evidence concerning the frauds.
The same consideration shows that it did not tend to
incriminate the witness. It neither led nor could have
led to a discovery of his (rime. So the adinission of his
signature to certainl checks, at1itough it fvrnishicd a posible

been any dispute about it, which there was not, in the
circumstances of this case at least had neither connection
nor criminating effect. When the statute speaks of testimony concerning a matter it means concerning it in a
substantial way, just as the constitutional protection
is confined to real danger and does not extend to remote
possibilities out of the ordinary course of law. Brown
v. Walker, 161, U. S. 591, 599, 600. See. 5 Wigmore,
Evidence, § 2281, p. 238. Other questions would have
to be dealt with before the petitioner could prevail upon
his plea; but as we consider what we have said sufficient,
we shall discuss it at no greater length. There was no
dispute as to the facts and a verdict upon it for the
Government properly was directed by the court.
The other matters complained of would not have warranted the issue of the writ of certiorari and may be dealt
with in few words. The petitioner was denied a separate
trial, and this is alleged as error. But it does not appear
that the discretion confided to the trial judge was abused.
United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 672. Again it is said
that if the evidence proved the petitioner guilty of a conspiracy it proved him guilty of the substantive offence.
It may be that there has been an abuse of indictment for
conspiracy, as suggested by Judge Holt in United States v.
Kissel, 173 Fed. Rep. 823, 828, but it hardly is made clear
to us that this is an instance. At all events the liability for
conspiracy is not taken away by its success-that is, by
the accomplishment of the substantive offence at which
the conspiracy aims. Brown v. Elliott, 225 U. S. 392. Reg.
v. Button, 11 Q. B. 929. Rex v. Spragg, 2 Burr. 993, 999.
An objection is urged to the admission of certain books,
called the pink books, in evidence-they being the books
in which were entered weights given by one set of weighers the city weighers-the weighers not having been
tailed. These weights were the higher ones and were
introduced as evidence of the discrepancy. They appear

to have been accepted by the company, were checked by
the company's tallymen, who testified, and if other evidence than that of the men who made the entries was necessary it was produced.
See 2 Wigmore, Evidence,
§§ 1521, 1530. Another objection to evidence concerned
the admission of testimony that the same course of conduct was going on long before the date in the indictment
when it is alleged that the defendants conspired. The
indictment of course charged a conspiracy not barred by
the statute of limitations, but it was permissible to prove
that the course of fraud was entered on long before and
kept up.
Wood v. United States, 16 Pet. 342, 360.
Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 76. The
acts and directions of earlier date tended to show that the
same conspiracy was on foot. The petitioner was there.
The time of his becoming a party to it was uncertain. The
longer it had lasted the greater the probability that he
knew of it and that his acts that helped it were done with
knowledge of their effect. We think it unnecessary to discuss the suggestion that the evidence did not warrant leaving the case to the jury, or to add further to the discussion
that the case received below.
Judgment affirmed.

No. 72. Submitted December 6, 1912.-Decided January 27, t913.

Wihere the plaintiffs in an action under the Employers' Liability Act
are the sole beneficiaries under the statute, a general verdict in their
favor, without instructions on this point, overcomes the objectioni
of lack of capacity to sue.
