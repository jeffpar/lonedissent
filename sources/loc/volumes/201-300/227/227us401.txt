they are such as travel from place to place selling the goods
carried about with them, not such as take orders for the
delivery of goods to be shipped in the course of commerce.
Here, as the facts show, the sample ranges carried about
from place to place are not sold. Orders are taken and
transmitted to the manufacturer in another State for
ranges to be delivered in fulfillment of such orders, which
are in fact shipped in interstate commerce and delivered
to the persons who ordered them. Business of this character, as well settled by the decisions of this court, constitutes interstate commerce, and the, privilege of doing
it cannot be taxed by the State.
It follows that the judgments of the Supreme Court of
Arkansas must be reversed and the cases remanded to
that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with
this opinion.
Reversed.

Mr. A. C. Lyon for plaintiff in error:
The Arkansas statute, c6rrectly construed, does not
apply to an interstate commerce transaction such as the
agreed statement of facts in this case shows. Plaintiff in
error was not engaged in peddling and his acts do not
come within the scope of the Arkansas statute. Commonwealth v. Farnum, 114 Massachusetts, 267; St. Paul v.

question, and this court will follow the interpretation of
the Arkansas Supreme Court.
Plaintiff in error was engaged in interstate commerce.

The Arkansas statute attempts to regulate and impose
a burden upon interstate commerce, and is, therefore,
unconstitutional and void.
The act of Arkansas is invalid because, in its effect and
operation it practically applies only to non-residents and
hence abridges the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the several States. None of the articles named are
manufactured to any great extent, if at all, in Arkansas.
Taxing those who peddle or sell these articles, therefore,
imposes a burden upon non-resident manufacturers who
must furnish all the necessary supply, and limits and prescribes the methods by which they can sell their product in
Arkansas. Statutes in which such a discrimination or any
discrimination against non-residents results from express
terms, are plainly unconstitutional. Ward v. Maryland, 12
Wall. 418; Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275; Guy v. Baltimore, 100 U. S. 434; Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344.
Statutes which have the effect and operation of discriminating against the citizens of outside States are
equally as invalid and unconstitutional as those which
expressly so discriminate. Utah v. Bayer, 97 Pac. Rep.
129; Oregon v. Wright, 100 Pac. Rep. 296; Smith v. Farr,
104 Pac. Rep. 401; Minnesota v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313;

The act of Arkansas is prohibitive and confiscatory,
and deprives persons of life, liberty or property without
due process of law, and hence is unconstitutional and
invalid. The statute is intended to destroy and annihilate
the business covered by its terms. In re McCoy, 101 Pac.

the effect of discriminating against the citizens outside of
the State. Ex parte Byles, 93 Arkansas, p. 620.
Counsel are in error in insisting that the statute selects
a few articles not manufactured in this State and imposes
a prohibitive tax on the sale thereof, thus excluding foreign
manufactured articles and preventing non-resident merchants from selling them here. Even if none of these
articles are manufactured in the State, that does not affect
the validity of the statute, nor is the tax or license fee
of $200 per annum prohibitive. Armour Packing Co. v.

Except as restrained by its own constitution or by the
Constitution. of the United States, a State by its legislature has full power to prescribe any system of taxation
which, in its judgment, is best or necessary for its people
and government.
Whether the enactment of a statute is really adapted
to bring about the result desired from its passage and calculated to promote the general welfare, are all matters
with which the state court is familiar, but a like familiarity
cannot be ascribed to this court. Welsh v. Swasey, 214

class of wholesale dealers mentioned in it is to be referred

one hand, fair traders, particularly established shopkeepers, resident permanently in towns and other places, and
paying rent and taxes there for local privileges, from the
mischiefs of being undersold by itinerant persons, to their
injury, and, on the other hand, to guard the public from the
impositions practiced by such persons in the course of their
dealings, who, having no known residence, carry on a trade
by means of vending goods conveyed from place to place by
horse or cart. See also Graffty v. Rushville, 107 Indiana, 502.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

227 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiffs in error were convicted of peddling buggies in Greene County, Arkansas, without having paid
the license or privilege tax required by an act of the
Arkansas legislature approved April 1, 1909 (Act 97, Acts
of 1909, p. 292), regulating the sale of lightning rods,
steel stove ranges, clocks, pumps and vehicles in the
counties of that State. (The provisions of such statute
are set out in the case just decided, Crenshawv. Arkansas.)
The Supreme, Court of Arkansas affirmed the judgments
upon the authority of Crenshaw v. State, 95 Arkansas, 464
(144 S. W. Rep. 211), and the cases are here upon writ of
error.
The cases were. submitted upon an agreed statement
of facts, the gist of which is that the Spaulding Manufacturing Company, a partnership, with its principal place
of business and factory at Grinnell, Iowa, manufactures
buggies and automobiles which are sold directly to the
consumers throughout the United States. It has no permanent place of business in Arkansas, but sends a force of
salesmen or canvassers, in charge of a superintendent, into
Greene and other counties of Arkansas, who travel about
exhibiting their sample buggies and taking orders for
future delivery. Where orders are taken, a memorandum
is signed by the purchaser, stipulating for the delivery of
the vehicle within a certain time, and a note for the purchase price is secured. The orders are turned ov r to the
superintendent, who, if he finds the financial responsibility
of the customers satisfactory, transmits the orders to an
agent of the company at Memphis, Tennessee, where
vehicles of the company of various grades and kinds are
stored. Vehicles to fill the orders are selected, tagged with
the name of the purchaser, and shipped in ear-la'd lots
to a place near where they are to be delivered, consigned
to the company. An employ6 of the company, usually

a,
different person from the salesman, called a deliveryman,
re eires the vehicles and delivers them to the respective
pourchtisers, no storage house being maintained at that
point, it was further agreed that no vehicles, save the
arnpes, which are never sold, are brought into or stored
"kansas,
'
except for the purpose of delivery upon
q;r pre-liously taken; and no vehicles are sold other
Ihan upow -rders tak"s' before they are brought into the
State. The plaintiffs in error were saltsrnen and transActed the business above described.
The manner in which the business of soliciting orders
for and delivering vehicles was done by the Spaulding
"ua- fa.eturing Company, differs in,
no practical or materioa particular from that employed by the Wrought Iron
k ~nge Company in the case just decided (Crenshaw v.
Av a'r,nsas). In fact, the only difference isthat the ranges
were shipped to the company, bearing no marks to identiy the purchasers, and were delivered to the purchasers
by the deliverymen without distinction, while the vehicles
were tagged at Memphis and upon drrival in Arkansas
wrere delivered by the deliverymen to the purchasers
whose names appeared upon the tags attached to the
vehicles. This is merely a matter of detail in the manner
inwhich the business is conducted and does not affect its
character. The decision in Crenshaw v. Arkansas, ante,
p. 389, has dealt with precisely the same statute and
substantially the same facts and controls the present
cases.
The judgments of the Supreme Court of Arkansas must
therefore be reversed and the cases remanded to that
court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this
opinion.
Reversed.
