MR. JUsrcE McRET-oLDS delivered the opinion of the

court.
An Illinois statute of 1903 amended the Act of 1853
which gave a right of action for wrongful death by adding
thereto-" Providedfurther, that no action shall be brought
or prosecuted in this State, to recover damages for a death
occurring outside of this State." Our jurisdiction is
invoked upon the theory that validity of the amending
act was challenged below because of conflict with the
Federal Constitution. But the point was not raised prior
to the petition to the Supreme Court for a rehearing which
was overruled without more. 290 Illinois, 227. It could
have been presented earlier. According to the well established rule we may not now consider it; and the writ of
error must be dismissed. Godehaux Co. v. E8Wt-inal, 251
U. S. 179.

BANK OF MIfNDEN ET AL v. CLEMNT, ADMINISTRATRIX OF CLEMENT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA.
No. 238. Submitted March 21, 1921.-Decided April 11, 1921.
1. A life insurance policy payable to the executors, administrators or
asigns of the insured is his property and subject to the claims of his
creditors. P.128.

2. A state law exempting policies so payable and their avails from the
debts of the insured is invalid under Art. 1, J 10, of the Constitution,
as applied to his debt under a promissory note antedating the law
and to policies also antedating it though later than the note. P. 129.

BANK OF MINDEN v. CLEMEN.
126.

Opinion of the CourL

THs case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Hampden Story, Mr. J. S. Atkinson and Mr. Robert
Roberts for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. J. D. Wkinson for defendant in error. Mr. L. K.
Watcins was also on the brief.
M. JuLrucz McRzriois delivered the opirion of the
court.
By Act No. 189 of 1914, the Louisiana Legislature
undertook to exempt from debts of the assured the avails
of insurance upon his life when payable to his estate.
Before passage of that act and while indebted to plaintiffs in error banks by notes which were renewed from
time to time until his death, 0. P. Clement took out two
policies upon his life with loss payable to his executors,
administrators or assigns. He died in 1917 and his
admmistratix collected the stipulated sums amounting
to $4,433.33. The succession was insolvent, and the banks
sought to subject the insurance money to their claims,
maintaining that if construed and applied so as to exempt
such funds the Act of 1914 would impair the obligations
of their contracts and violate ยง 10, Article I, Fede-al
Constitution. The Supreme Court of the State held that
acceptance of the renewal notes did not operate as novations, but that: the statute protected the insurance money
without violating the Federal Constitution since the
exemption "impaired the obligation of the preExisting

contract very slightly and remotely."

146 Louisiana, 385.

Section 10, Article I, of the Constitution-" No State
shall . . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of onlts"--has been much considered by this
court and often applied to preserve the integrity of con-

tatual obligations

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. S.

When the deceased took out the policies of insurance
upon his life they became his property subject to claims of
his creditors. New York Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, 117 U. S. 591, 597; Central Bank of Washington v.
Hume, 128 U. S. 195, 204; Burlingham v. Crouse, 228

In Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 197, 198,
opinion by 'Mr. Chief Justice 'Marshall, it was said:
"What is the obligation of a contract? and what will
impair it? It would seem difficult to substitute words
which are more intelligible, or less liable to misconstruetion, than those which are to be explained. A contract
is an agreement, in which a party undertakes to-do, or
not to do, a particular thing. The law binds him to perform his undertaking, and this is, of course, the obligation of his contract. . . . Any law which releases a
part of this obligation, must, in the literal sense of the
word, impair it. . . . But it is not true, that, the
parties have in view only the property in possession when
the contract is formed, or that its obligation does not extnd to future acquisitions. Industry, talents and integrity constitute a fund which is as confidently trusted as
property itself. Future acquisitions are, therefore, liable
for contracts; and to release them from this liability impairs their obligation." And, in Planters' Bank v. Sharp,
6 How. 301, 327, opinion by Mr. Justice Woodbury: "One
of the tests that a contract has been impaired is, that its
value has by legislation been diminished. It is not. by
the Constitution, to be impaired at all. This is not a
question of degree or manner or cause, but. of encroaching
ofany respect on its obligation, dispensing with any part
of its force." Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 257;

McCracken v. Hayward, 2 How. 608, 612; Edwards v.

Kearzey, 96 U. S. 595, 600.
So far as the statute of 1914 undertook to exempt the
policies and their proceeds from antecedent debts it came
into conflict with the Federal Constitution. See Lessley v.
Phipps, 49 Mssissippi, 790; Johnson v. Flecher, 54
Mississippi, 628; Rice v. Smith, 72 Mississippi, 42; In re
Heibron's Estate, 14 Washington, 536; Skinner v. Holt,

The judgment of the court below must be reversed and
the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinio-
