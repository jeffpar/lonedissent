be a strictly public one, or a semi-public one as in the
Ochs and Lake Erie & Western Cases, supra, and the case
at bar; or whether it be a siding privately used but owned
by the railroad as in the Swift Case, upra; and in such
cases the fact that the spur extends over land not part of
the carrier's right of way is immaterial. The construction
contended for by the railroad, even if not applied to team
tracks in the freight yards of a great cit', would place
all loaded cars arriving elsewhere at. the owner's risk from
the moment they were detached from a train, although
the consignee had not even been notified of their arrival.
It is clear that the immunity conferred by the last
paragraph of section 5 does not apply to loaded cars on
the spur here involved. Whether the same rule should
apply to cars on strictly private industry tracks effectively
separated from the terminal and exclusively under private
control, like the industry tracks involved in Bers v. Erie

124, par. 20, and § 145 of the Judicial Code," which confer con-

current jurisdiction on the District Courts and the Court of Claims
to adjudicate clidm against the United States. Held, referring to
the legislative history of the act and to other acts in pari matia,
that the jurisdiction under § 10 is conferred exclusively on the Distict Courts as part of their ordinary jurisdiction over actions at law
for money, of which the right to trial by jury is an incident, and

that a judgment rendered under that section is therefore not reviewable in this court by direct writ of eror. P. 550.

Pursuant to § 10 of the Lever Act (August 10, 1917, c.
53, 40 Stat. 276, 279) the President requisitioned for the
Army on April 18, 1918, a radial drill belonging to Pfitsch.
The Board of Appraisers of'the War Department found
its then value to be $3,979.50, and awarded him that
amount as compensation. Pfitsch declared this amount
was unsatisfactory and insisted that the value was greater
and that he was entitled also to interest from the date
of the taking. On February 5, 1919, the Government
paid him an amount equal to 75 per centum of the award.

UNITED STATES v. PFITSCH.
547.

Opinion of the Court.

Thereupon, this suit was brought by him in the District
Court of the United States for Southern New York to
recover the balance alleged to be due. The case was tried,
by agreement, without a jury. The court found the value
to be $4,550 and entered judgment for the part then unpaid together with interest from the date of taking, at
the rate of six per cent. on the amounts from time to time
unpaid. The Government brought the case here by direct
-writ of error and assigned as the only error that interest
should not have been allowed.
The preliminary question arises whether this c'urt has
jurisdiction on direct writ of error. The answer to be
given to it depends upon the nature of the jurisdiction
conferred upon the District Court by § 10 of the Lever
Act. If the jurisdiction is to be exercised in the manner
provided by § 24, paragraph 20, of the Judicial Code,
which confers upon the District *Court jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims, a direct writ of error
lies from this court. J. Homer Fritch,Inc. v. United States,
248 U. S. 458. If,.however, the jurisdiction is the ordinary
jurisdiction of the District Court, the writ of error should
have gone, in the first instance, from the Circuit Court of
Appeals under § 128 of the Judicial Code. The nature of
the jurisdiction of the District Court is of importance,
not only because of the question directly involved, but
because the answer given to it will determine incidentally
whether plaintiffs who proceed under § 10 are entitled
to a trial by jury. For § 24, paragraph 20 of the Judicial
Code declares that "all suits brought and tried under
the provisions of this paragraph shall be tried by the
court without a jury." See United Stales v. McGrane, 270
Fed. Rep. 761; Filbin Corporation v. United Stales, 266
Fed. Rep. 911.
Section 10 provides that the President may requisition
foods, feeds, fuels and other war supplies with the necessary storage facilities, and that he shall ascertain and pay

just compensation for them. But if any person is not
satisfied with the President's award he is to receive 75%
of the award and for the balance claimed "shall be enand jurisdiction
titled to sue the United States . .
is hereby conferred on the United States District Courts
to hear and determine all such controversies." Three
later sections of the act which provide for requisitioning
other classes of property,-- 12 relating to factories,
mines and pipe lines; § 16, to distilled spirits; and § 25,
to coal or coke plants or businesses,-make provision for

suits against the United States to recover just compensation in terms materially different from that in § 10.
Each of those three sections provides in identical terms
that a person dissatisfied with the President's award
"shall be entitled to sue the United States
. .
in
the manner provided by Section twenty-four, paragraph
twenty, and Section one hundred and forty-five of the
Judicial Code." The latter of these sections of the Judicial
Code confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Claims to
adjudicate claims against the United States, and the
former confers upon the District Courts jurisdiction concurrent with the Court of Claims in cases which do not
involve more than ten thousand dollars. Thus, while
§ 12, 16 and 25 of the Lever Act, in terms, confer jurisdiction concurrently upon the Court of Claims and the
District Courts sitting as a court of claims, § 10, in terms,
confers jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under it upon
the District Courts alone.
The question presented to us is whether this exclusive
jurisdiction granted the District Courts by § 10 is to be
exercised in accordance with the law governing the usual
procedure of a District Court in actions at law for money
compensation or by the provisionz of the law governing
the exceptional jurisdiction concurient with the Court of
Claims where it sits without a jury.
The legislative history of the Lever Act establishes that

the difference of the jurisdictional provision in §10 from
those of §§ 12, 16 and 25 was the result not of inadvertence, but of deliberate action in the face of opposition.
The jurisdictional provision of § 10, as introduced into
the House of Representatives and as originally passed by
it, was in the precise form in which it was enacted into
law. 65th Cong., 1st sess., House Rep. 75; 55 Cong. Rec.
4113. When the bill reached the Senate from the House,
the Senate Committee reported an amendment striking
out the House provision and substituting a provision
which made § 10 in this respect identical with §§ 12, 16
and 25. That is, the Senate Committee's amendment
provided that suits under § 10 should be brought against
the United States "in the manner provided by section 24,
paragraph 20, and section 145 of the Judicial Code."
55 Cong. Rec. 4626. This would have conferred concurrent jurisdiction upon the C6urt of Claims and the
District Courts sitting as a court of claims. As so amended
§ 10 was passed by the Senate; but the House refused to
concur in this amendment. And this disagreement, with
eight others relating to § 10, was sent to the Conference
Committee. 55 Cong. Rec. 5473. The House conferees
recommended receding from objections to the eight other
Senate amendments of this section, but they insisted upon
the objection to the change of the jurisdictional provision.
55 Cong. Rec. 5733-5737. The Senate conferees recommended receding from its amendment to the jurisdictional
provision and that the original House provision be restored. 55 Cong. Rec. 5709. In reporting for the House
conferees, Mr. Lever said of this amendment:
".:Amendment 30. This amendment gives jurisdiction,
in suits to recover just compensation under section 10
of the House Bill, to the Court of Claims in addition to
the United States district courts. The Senate recedes."

Rec. 5737.

256U. &

It is plain, then, that Congress had this question presented to its attention in a most precise form. It had
the issue clearly drawn between granting for the adjudication of cases arising under this section concurrent jurisdictiou in the Court of Claims and the District Courts
without a trial by jury., or of establishing an exclusive
jurisdiction in the District Courts of which the right to a
jury trial is an incident. The first alternative was rejected, and the reason given for this rejection in the statement of the House conferees is that the proposed amendment would confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Clims
It is difficult to conceive of any rational ground for rejecting the clear and explicit amendment made by the Senate
except to accord a trial by jury. All difficulties of construction vanish if we are willing to give to the words of

§ 10, deliberately adopted, their natural meaning.
Furthermore, it is significant that this is not the only
occasion upon which Congress has provided for suits
against the United States exclusively in the District
Courts. Section 1 of the War Risk Insurance Act of
May 20, 1918, ow 77, 40 Stat. 555, provides that suits upon
insurance policies "may be brought against the United
States in the district court of the United States in and
for the district in which such beneficiaries or any one of
them resides." The Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125, § 3, 40
Stat. 1348, which authorizes the President to requisition
storage facilities for wheat,- rovides, in the words of § 10
of the Lever Act, that "jurisdiction is hereby conferred
on the United States district courts to hear and determine
all such controversies." And § 2 of the Act of July 11,
1918, c. 145, 40 Stat. 898, permits suits against the United
States on marine insurance "in the district court of the
United States, sitting in admiralty."
A survey of the war legislation permitting the seizure of
property discloses that Congress has established three

United States for compensation. In seventeen instances'

sections of the Judicial Code for concurrent jurisdiction

it conferred jurisdiction only on the District Courts. In

of Claims.2 The established rule of statutory construc-

2. Under 110 of the Federal Control Act, if the caem of action arose
prior to government control, suit might be instituted or continued

to judgment against the owy

as though there had been

no taking over by the Government, save for the immunity of the
physeal property from levy and the power of the President to
regulate suift in the public interest: if it arose during government
operation, the "earier while under Federal control," meaning in
this onnection the transportation system as distinguished from
its corporate owner, was still liable and, by legal implication, suit
could be brought against the Government, or its operating agency,
as the legal person responsible under the existing law for such
carrier's acts. P. 561.
3. The order of the Director General of Railroads providing that suits
on cause of action arising from the operation oi any carrier during
government control should be brought against him, and for his
sultitution as defendant in pending suits of that class brought
against the carrier companies, was within his authority. P. 561.
