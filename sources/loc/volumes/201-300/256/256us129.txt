Kearzey, 96 U. S. 595, 600.
So far as the statute of 1914 undertook to exempt the
policies and their proceeds from antecedent debts it came
into conflict with the Federal Constitution. See Lessley v.

McRYNoLDS delivered the opinion of the

This cause is here upon writ of error to the Supreme
Court of the State of California. 182 California, 252.
There is also an application for certiorari, but under
the settled practice no adequate grounds therefor are
shown.
By the Act of May 26, 1913, effective August 10, 1913
(Stats. 1913, p. 252), the legislature of California undertook to create the Sacramento and San Joaquin Dranag
District, including 1,725,553 acres along the general
course of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and
particularly an extensive area south of Stockton. The
Reclamation Board, appointed as directed by the statute,
levied a tax of 5250,000 for general preliminary expenses
incidental to the project and appointed assessors to apportion the same. Certain of plaintiff in.error's lands lying
south of Stockton were assessed at five cents per acre, and
to annul this assemnt it began the present proceeding.
In support of the writ of error reliance is placed upon the
contention that, as construed by the state courts, the
Act of 1913 denies plaintiff in error opportunity to show
that its lands will receive no special or direct benefits from
the proposed works, and therefore conflicts with the
Fourteenth Amendment. But we think that when the
writ was sued out (May, 1920) this claim had already
become too unsubstantial to support our jurisdiction as
defined by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat.
726. Since Houck v. Ltte River DrainageDisfrid, (1915)
239 U. S. 254, the doctrineihs, been definitely settled
that in the absence of flagrant abuse or purely arbitrary
action a State may establish drainage districts and tax
lands therein for local improvements, and that none of
such lands may escape liability solely because they will
not receive direct benefits. The allegations of the original
