and serves all the purposes of exemplary damages."
Leep v. Railway Co., 58 Arkansas, 407, 440-441. But
whether in a proceeding against the Director General
it shall be deemed compensation or a penalty presents a
question not of state, but of federal law. Whatever name
be applied, the element of punishment clearly predominates and Congress has not given its consent that suits of
this character be brought against the United States.
The judgment against the Director General, so far as it
provided for recovery of the penalty, was erroneous.
The case is properly here on writ of error. The petition
for writ of certiorari, consideration of which was p-st
poned to the hearing on the merits, is therefore denied.
Judgmnent reversed.

MR. JusTIcE BRANDEis delivered the opinion of the

court.
This case comes here on writ of certiorari (251 U. S. 550)
to the Supreme Court of North Carolina, which affirmed
(178 N. Car. 325) a judgment of $21 against the NorfolkSouthern Railroad Company in favor of Owens, a shipper.
The amount was assessed under a statute of the State
as a penalty for undue delay in making delivery of an
intrastate shipment made March 27, 1918. At that time
the railroad was in the possession and control of the Government, and was being operated by the Director General
under the Federal Control Act of March 21, 1918, c. 25,
40 Stat. 451. The only question presented for decision
is whether the company was liable for the penalty. We
are of opinion that it was not, for the reasons stated in.Missouri PacficR. R. Co. v. Au, decided this day, ante, 554.
