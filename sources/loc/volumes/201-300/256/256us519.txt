Syllabus.

that the excess charges are refunded has corresponding
extent.
We have said enough to demonstrate the existence of
the jurisdiction of the District Court and its scope. Other
points are raised, but they relate not to the question of
jurisdiction, but to the mode in which the jurisdiction
ought to be exercised. If they have substance--as to
which we make no intimation-they will be ubject to
review in the appropriate method, after the conclusion
of the proceeding.

ANCHOR OIL COMPANY v. GRAY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 188. Argued January 27, 1921.-Decided June 1, 1921.
1. The authority of the Secretary of the Interior under § 2 of the Act
of May 27, 1908, c. 199,35 Stat. 312, to approve an oil and gas lease
made by a full-blood Creek allottee is not taken away, under § 9,
by the death of the allottee. P. 522.
2. As respects the rights of the allottee's heirs and those claiming under

back and takes effect as of the execution of the lease by the parties
named therein. P. 522.
3. Under the Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1026, the lodging
of such lease in the office of the United States Indian Agent (now

Iduskogee, ior
transnmssiou to the Secretary of the Interior, constituted construetive notice to persons who, after the death of the lemor and after

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. John Devereux, for appellant, submitted.
Mr. Preston C. West, with whom Mr. A. A. Davidson
was on the brief, for appellees.
Mr. Geo. S. Ramsey, Mr. Malcolm E. Rosser, Mr. Villard
Martin, Mr. James A. Veasey, Mr. John 31. Chick, Mr. G.
Earl Shaffer, Mr. James C. Denton and Mr. Edgar A.
deMeu/es, by leave of court, filed a brief as amic curie.
Mn. JUSTICE Prrz-Ey delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit in equity instituted by appellant against
appeflees in a state court of Oklahoma, involving the
ownership of a leasehold estate for oil and gas mining purposes in a Creek Indian allotment containing 80 acres,
situate in Tulsa County, Oklahoma. Upon petition of
appellees it was removed to the United States District
Court upon the ground that it arose under the Constitution and laws of the United States; a motion to dismiss
the suit was granted by that court, the decree of dismissal
was affaied by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit (257 Fed. Rep. 277), and an appeal brings
the case here.
From appellant's amended petition it appears that the
80 acres were allotted to Jennie Samuels, a full-blood
Creek Indian, as her distributive share of the lands of
the tribe, and patented to her in the year 1903. December 5, 1914, pursuant to the Act of Congress of May 27,
1908, c. 199, § 2, 35 Stat. 312, and the rules and regu-

lations of the Secretary of the Interior, she made an oil
and gas mining lease to McDonnell 'nd Egan covering
the lands in controversy, and this was filed in the office
of the United States Indian Agent (now designated as
Superintendent of the Five Civilized Tribes), Union
Agency, at Muskogee, on January 5, 1915. It was forwarded by the Agent to the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs with a favorable recommendation October 14, 1915;
submitted by the Commissioner to the Secretary of the
Interior for approval, and by him approved October 21,
1915. It was first filed for record in the county clerk's
office of Tulsa County on August 10, 1916. Appellees
are the owners of this lease, and are in possession of the
lands.
Jennie Samuels died intestate October 11, 1915 (ten
days before the Secretary's approval of the above lease),
leaving as her heirs a daughter, Feney Rogers, and a
granddaughter, Lina White, both full-blood Creek Indians,
and to them the lands descended, subject to the lease.
In the following December they made oil and gas leases
to one Williams covering the same 80 acres, which were
approved by the county court having jurisdiction of the
estate of Jennie Samuels, and were recorded in the county
records prior to August 10, 1916. These leases are held
by appellant, whose interest was acquired, according to
the averments of the petition, without knowledge or
notice of the lease made by Jennie Samuels.
Appellees, having entered into possession, commenced
drilling and discovered and produced petroleum and
natural gas in paying quantities. This suit was commenced in January, 1917, appellant praying that their lease
be canceled and they enjoined from interfering with
appellant in the possession of the premises, and required
to account.
Like the courts below, we find it unnecessary to consider the inherent validity or invalidity of appellant's

title, because we conclude that that of appellees is good
and has priority over it. The authority of the Secretary
of the Interior to approve and thereby confirm oil and gas
mining leases made by full-blood Creek allottees upon
their allotments-derived from § 2 of the Act of May 27,
190--did not cease at the death of the allottee by reason
of the provision of § 9 of the same act (35 Stat. 315),
"That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized
Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the
alienation of said allottee's land: Prodded, That no conveyance of any interest of any full-bood Indian heir in such
land shall be valid unless approved by the court having
jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased
allottee." The validity of the lease made by Jennie
Samuels having been conditioned upon the approval of
the Secretary, such approval might be given at any time
either before or after her death, so far as the rights of her
heirs and those claiming under them with notice were
concerned, and the approval when given related back and
took effect as of the execution of the lease by the parties
named therein (Pickeringv. Lomax, 145 U. S. 310, 314,
316; Lomax v. Pickering, 173 U. S. 26, 27, 32; Lykin v.
Medhat, 184 U. 8. 169, 171-172).
The lease received the approval which gave it completevalidity, some time before the first of the leases made by
the heirs to Williams. And Williams was charged with
notice of the prior grant, because, under the provision
of the Act of March 1, 1907, c. 2285, 34 Stat. 1015, 1026,
"The filing heretofore or hereafter on any lease in the office
of the United States Indian agent, Union Agency, Muskogee, Indian Territory, shall be deemed constructive
notice," the lodging of the prior lease with that officer
in January, 1915, for tranrsniaion to the Secretary of
the Interior, constituted notice to all parties thereafter
claiming under her or her heirs. We agree that this provision was neither repealed nor superseded by the admis-

sion of the State of Oklahoma into the Union, or by the
provisions of the Enabling Act, or the constitution of the
State which became effective November 16, 1907. As
the Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out (257 Fed. Rep.
282), § 1 of the Enabling Act (June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34
Stat. 267), contained a proviso "that nothing contained
in the said constitution shall be construed to limit or impair the rights of person or property pertaining to the
Indians . . . or to limit or affect the authority of
the Government of the United States to make any law
or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this
Act had never been passed." While § 21 of the same act
(34 Stat. 277), and § 2 of the Schedule to the constitution
of Oklahoma (Rev. Laws Cklahoma, 1910, p. cxcix),
contained provisions to the effect that laws in force in
the Territory of Oklahoma at the time of the admission
of the State not repugnant to its constitution and not
locally inapplicable should be extended to and remain in
force throughout the State, there was nothing to show
an intent to repeal or supersede the provision of the Act
of Congress of March 1, 1907, above quoted, or to establish the local recordation statutes in its place so far as
related to Indian leases, such as we have here. See Ex
parte Webb, 225 U. S. 663, 682-683.
The satisfactory reasoning of the courts below, which
we have followed in outline, has the support of a wellconsidered decision by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma
in Scioto Oil Co. v. O'Hern, 169 Pac. Rep. 483.
Appellant lays some stress upon particular provisions
in the Jennie Samuels lease, but we find nothing in them
to affect the result. They are sufficiently dealt with in
the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals (257 Fed.
Rep. 280-281).

Decree affirmed.
