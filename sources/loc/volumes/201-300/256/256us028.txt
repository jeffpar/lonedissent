We, Samuel S. Gannett, Washington, D. C.; Charles

Jr., Greenville, Mississippi, Commissioners appointed
under the decree of the court, rendered March 22, 1920,
'to run, locate and designate the boundary line between
said States along that portion of said river which ceased
to be a part of the main navigable channel of skid river
as the result of said avulsion, in accordance with the above
principles: Commencing at a point in said Mississippi
River about one mile southwest from Friar Point, Coahoma County, Mississippi, where the main navigable
channel of said river, prior to said avulsion, turned and
flowed in a southerly direction, and thence following along
the middle of the former main channel of navigation by
its several courses and windings to the end of said portion
of said Mississippi River which ceased to be a part of the
main channel of navigation of said river as the result of
said avulsion of 1848,' have the honor to submit the following report, which report is accompanied by a map entitled::

record was read, local data and maps were examined,
and preliminary investigations made in the field.
The Commissioners met at Friar Point, Mississippi,
August 4, 1920, and proceeded to view the ground and
formulate a plan of procedure.
The determination of the boundary line proceeded upon
the finding of the law as laid down by the court, namely,
that if the former channel of a river separating two States
ceases to be navigable by reason of an avulsion, it does
not render inapplicable the rule which fixes as the boundary
line the middle of the navigable channel rather than the
middle line between the banks (State of Arkansas vs.
State of Tennessee, 246 U. S., page 158, sec. 4).
After a study of all the evidence in the case and a careful examination of the physical facts on the ground at
this time, the Commissioners are unanimously of the
opinion that 'Horseshoe Lake' or 'Old River' or 'Pecan
Lake' was, at the time the avulsion or cut-off took place,
the main navigable channel of the Mississippi River, and
therefore this portion of the boundary line should follow
in general the deepest water in this lake.
Leaving the west or lower end of Horseshoe Lake, the
boundary line as determined by your Commissioners
follows, in general, the course of the present 'channel'
or well-defined chute which runs in a northeasterly direction to the Mississippi River, because the evidence on
the ground (namely, well-defined high banks on both
sides for practically the entire distance, both of which
are covered with timber of about the same age; its location
west of the meander line of 1833 near the 'Horseshoe
Lake' where caving would be expected, and its location
east of the meander line of 1833 at a point farther north
where accretion would be expected) clearly indicates that
this was the last channel actually navigated by the steamboats that entered the 'Horseshoe Lake' several years
after the avulsion or cut-off of 1848.

ARKANSAS v. MISSISSIPPI.
28.

Final Decree.

In arriving at the proper location for the line between
the northeast end of 'Horseshoe Lake' and the Mississippi River at a point about one mile southwest from Friar
Point, we considered the following facts and conditions:
(a) The Arkansas shore, being in a concave bend,
would naturally undergo some caving or recession during
the 32 years between the date of the original land survey
(1816) and the date of the cut-off (1848).
(b) The 'slough' immediately east of the field in sections 10 and 15, township 4 south, range 4 east, being
totally devoid of short and irregular bends and following a generally uniform curve of radius similar to that of
the original river in this vicinity, was, without doubt,
formed by the main river, and the great difference in the
age of the timber on the west bank as compared with the
age of that on the east bank shows that the west' bank of
this 'slough' marked the most westerly limit of the main
river at the time of the avulsion.
(c) The Mississippi land survey of 1835 shows that an
island existed at that time near to the Mississippi shore
or meander line; evidence on the ground today shows conclusively that this portion of the area is much older than
is that part which lies farther to the west. The conformation of the old bank lines is such that accretion to the
Mississippi shore in this vicinity is a logical sequence.
We have therefore decided that this line after leaving
the northeast end of 'Horseshoe Lake' should gradually
swing over towards the northwest and follow the general
line of the 'slough,' but in front, or east, of the same, a
distance- which is approximately equal to that which is
ordinarily found between the main bank and the line of
deepest water in the Mississippi River.
After reaching a point which is opposite the upper end
of this 'slough' we must, in order to reach the present
river, cross over, for a distance of approximately a mile,
land that has evidently been formed by the process of

32

accretion since the time of the avulsion, and hence the
boundary line should be brought east, as soon as is practicable, to a point about midway between the old original
meander lines, and thence along this mid-line to the
Mississippi River.
Commencing at a point in said Mississippi River,
