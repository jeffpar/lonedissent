The Revenue Act of 1918, Title II, taxes by fixed percentages the net
nemne "received by estates of deceased persons during the period
of administration or settlement," and provides that the net income
shall be aseertmed by making from the grow income, as defined,
certain deductions, including "taxes paid or accrued within the
taxable year imposed by the authority of the United States, except
income, war-profits and exeess-profit taxes."
Hdd: (1) That "estate taxe," imposed by the Revenue Act of 1916,
are among the taxes deductible. (See New York Trust Co. v. ,isne,
ane, 345.) P. 634.
(2) That an estate tax "accrued " when, by the tenm of the Act of
1916, it became due, viz., one year from the decedent's death; and,
when paid by executors after the income tax year in which it accrued but before their return of income for that year was made or
required, was properly deducted. P. 635.

claimed to have been erroneously exacted from them as a
tax on the income of his estate while in their hands.
The testator died December 15, 1917. The Revenue
Act of 1916 1"imposed upon the transfer of the net estate
of every decedent " dying thereafter a tax which it called
an "estate tax." The act fixed the amount of the tax at a
named percentage "' of the value of the net estate," made
the tax a lien upon the "entire gross estate," required
that it be paid "out of the estate " before distribution,
declared that it should "be due one year after the decedent's death," charged the executor or administrator with
the duty of paying it, and declared that the receipt therefor should entitle him to a credit for the amount in the
usual settlement of his accounts. Under that act these
executors were required to pay an estate tax of $489,834.07.
The tax became due December 15, 1918, and they paid it
February 8, 1919. Shortly thereafter the executors made
a return, under the Revenue Act of 1918,2 of the income
of the testator's estate for the taxable year 1918 and
claimed in the return that in ascertaining the net income
for that year the estate tax of $489,834.07 should be
deducted. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue refused to allow the deduction and assessed an income tax
of $165,075.78 against the estate. Had the deduction
been allowed there would have been no taxable net income for that year and no part of the $165,075.78 would
have been collectible. Payment of that. sum, as so assessed,
was pressed on the executors and they paid it under duress.
Then, after taking the necessary steps to entitle them to
do so, they brought this suit in the Court of Claims to
recover the money thus exacted from them.
The sole question for decision is, was the estate tax

paid by the executors, and claimed by them as a deduction in the income tax return for the year 1918, an allowable deduction in ascertaining the net taxable income
of the estate for that year? The Court of Claims held
that it was. 56 Ct. Clms. 133.
The solution of the question turns entirely upon the
statutory provisions under which the two taxes were
severally collected. The Act of 1918, by §§ 210, 211 and
219, subjects the net income "received by estates of deceased persons during the period of administration or
settlement " to an income tax measured by fixed percentages thereof; by §§ 212 and 219 requires that the
net income be ascertained by taking the gross income,
as defined in § 213, and making the deductions named in
§ 214, and by § 214 makes express provision for the deduction of "taxes paid or accrued within the taxable year
imposed (a) by the authority of the United States, except
income, war-profits and excess-profits taxes." This last
provision is the important one here. It is not ambiguous,
but explicit, and leaves little room for construction. The
words of its major clause are comprehensive and include
every tax which is charged against the estate by the anthority of the United States. The excepting clause
specifically enumerates what is to be excepted. The
implication from the latter is that the taxes which it
enumerates- would be within the major clause were they
not expressly excepted, and also that there was no purpose to except any others. Estate taxes were as well
known at the time the provision was framed as the ones
particularly excepted. Indeed, the same act, by §§ 400410, expressly provides for their continued imposition
and enforcement. Thus their omission from the excepting
clause means that Congress did not intend to except them.
The Act of 1916 calls the estate tax a "tax" and particularly denominates it an "estate tax." This court
recently has recognized that it is a duty or excise and is

imposed in the exertion of the taxing power of the United
States. New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, ante, 345. It is
made a charge on the estate and is to be paid out of it by
the administrator or executor substantially as other taxes
and charges are paid. It becomes due not at the time
of the decedent's death, as suggested by counsel for the
Government, but one year thereafter, as the statute
plainly provides. It does not segregate any part of the
estate from the rest and keep it from passing to the administrator or executor for purposes of administration, as
counsel contend, but is made a general charge on the
gross estate and is to be paid in money out of any available funds or, if there be none, by converting other property into money for the purpose.
Here the estate tax not only "accrued," which means
became due, during the taxable year of 1918, but it was
paid before the income for that year was returned or
required to be returned. When the return was made the
executors claimed a deduction by reason of that tax.
We hold that under the terms of the Act of 1918 the
deduction should have been allowed.

1. A judgment of a state supreme court sustaining a state statute and
a city ordinance imposing taxes, over the objection that as construed
and applied they are repugnant to a law of the United States, is re-

viewable here by writ of error. P. 637.
