having failed in that defense, cannot, upon the second
trial, abandon that defense and insist that the Act of
May 11, 1912, repealed the Act of 1882."
The proposition has a relevant and conclusive application when a judgment of a former action is pleaded but
limited application when urged in the same suit, it expresses a practice only and useful as such, but not a
limitation of power. Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S.
436.
The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals,
having the power and exercising it, entertained the defense
of the Act of 1912, estimated it and decided it conclusive
against appellant's right to an allotment. As we have seen
there was no error in that ruling, and the decree of the
Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

10.

Syllabus.

Mr. Oscar C. Anderson, with whom Mr. Charles J.
Kappler was on the brief, for the Omaha Tribe of Indians,
by special leave of court.
MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
This case was argued and submitted with the Chase
Case, No. 242, ante, 1. It is a suit by Mary Gilpin by
her next friend to have adjudged to her a right to an
allotment of lands in the Omaha Reservation, she being
an Omaha Indian. The right is based on the same treaties
and acts of Congress as those passed upon in the Chase
Case, and the effect of the Act of May 11, 1912, repealing
the acts-that of 1882 and that of 1893.
The decree of the District Court was adverse to her
right, and this decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. 261 Fed. Rep. 841.
For the reasons stated in the opinion in the Chase Case,
the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
