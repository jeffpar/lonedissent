OCTOBER TERM. 1920.
Counsel for Parties.

256 U. S.

judgment reviewable here upon writ of certiorari or
appeal.
It is true that in Estate of Beckwith v. Commissioner of
Patents, 252 U. S. 538, this court allowed a writ of certiorari
from a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia, affirming a decision of the Commissioner of
Patents, in an application to register a trade-mark. No
question of the jurisdiction of the court was considered in
that case, and an inadvertent allowance of the writ of
certiorari does not establish the jurisdiction of the court.
Fritch, Inc. v. United States, 248 U. S. 458, 463.
It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, and the
petition for a writ of certiorari denied.
So ordered.

WHIPPLE v. MARTINSON.
40.

Syllabus.

Mr. Nathan Heard for Simplex Electric Heating Company, by special leave of court.
MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

In this case a writ of certiorari was granted by this
court on October 13, 1919. 250 U. S. 655. The case
involves an application for the registration of a trademark, which was refused by the Examiner in the Patent
Office, which decision was affirmed by the Commissioner
of Patents and his decision was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia. 49 App. D. C. 16.
This case is ruled by Nos. 139 and 113, just decided,
ante, 35. As the writ of certiorari in this case, for the
reasons stated in the opinion in No. 139, was improvidently
granted, it follows that the cause must be dismissed for
want of jurisdiction, and it is
So ordered.
