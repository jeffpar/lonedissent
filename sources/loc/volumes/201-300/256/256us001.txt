CHASE, JR., A MINOR, ETC. v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 242. Argued March 21, 22,1921.-Decided April 11, 1921.
1. The cession made by the Omaha Indians through the treaties of
1854 and 1865, the provision made by the latter for assigning parcels,
in the retained reservation, to members of the tribe in severalty, for
the exclusive use of themselves, their heirs and descendants, the
provisions made by the Act of 1882 (and the Act of 1893) for granting
allotments in severalty in trust for 25 years and then in fee, and the
further provision of the former act (not carried out) for conveying
the unallotted residue of the reservation to the tribe in trust for a
like period and then in fee discharged of the trust and of all charge
and incumbrance whatsoever,-did not deprive Congress of the
power to make other disposition of the unallotted reservation for
the benefit of the Indians. P. 6. United Sates v. Chase, 245 U. S.
89; Sizemore v. Brady, 235 U. S. 441.
2. The right to obtain an allotment under the acts referred to was not a
vested right as respects this power of Congress. P. 7.
3. The Act of May 11, 1912, c. 121,37 Stat. 111, by which the Secretary
of the Interior was "authorized" to sell all the unallotted lands of
the Omaha Reservation in parcels, with certain specific exceptions,
covers the whole subject of the disposition of those lands and supersedes the earlier provisions, supra, for allotting them. P.. 8.

4. Even if this act should be construed as permissive rather than
mandatory, the Secretary's refusal to allow further allotments
because of it is an exercise of his discretion to reserve the land for
disposition under it. P. 8.
5. Whether a party defendant, upon reversal of a judgment in his
favor; may introduce a new defense which was available on the
former trial, is not a question of jurisdiction but of practice. P. 9.
6. Held, that the courts below rightly permitted the United States to
set up a statutory repeal at the second trial which was ignored at the

first. P. 10.

APPEAL from a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals,
which affirmed a decree of the District Court dismissing
the bill in a suit brought by the appellant against the
United States for an adjudication of his membership in
the Omaha Tribe of Indians with a right to select an
allotment out of the lands of the Omaha Reservation.
The facts are stated in the opinion.
See also the reports of the case in the court below, 238
Fed. Rep. 887; 261 Fed. Rep. 833; and Gilpin v. United
States, 261 Fed. Rep. 841, s. c., post, 10.
Mr. John Lee Webster, with whom Mr. Hiram Chase
was on the briefs, for appellant:
The federal court has jurisdiction of suits by persons of
Indian blood claiming right to allotment of Indian lands.
The appellant was born into a right to allotment under
the Act of 1882, as amended by the Act of 1893. Chase
v. United States, 238 Fed. Rep. 887, 890.
The United States cannot now shift its ground of
defense. Having relied at the first trial, and on the first
appeal, upon the single proposition that the Act of 1893
repealed the Act of 1882, and thereby cut off the right
to allotment, and having failed in that defense, it cannot,
upon the second trial, abandon that defense and insist
that the Act of May 11, 1912, repealed the Act of 1882.

States as well as to individuals. United States v. California
& Oregon Land Co., 192 U. S. 355; Northern Pacific Ry.
Co. v. Slaght, 205 U. S. 122.
The Act of May 11, 1912, did not repeal the Act of 1882,
or the amendatory Act of 1893. In any event, theActs of
1882 and 1893, providing for allotments to members of
the tribe, remain in full force, and continue to be operative
until there shall be an actual sale of the lands. The Act
of 1912 does not make reference to the other acts, and
contains no repealing clause. The repealing clause in the
original draft of the act was stricken out. It contains no
words which, by their terms, take away the continuing
right of allotment provided for in the other acts.
Repeals by implication are not favored.
The Secretary of the Interior has never taken any steps
to sell, nor made any declaration that he intends to sell
the lands of the Omaha Reservation, under the Act of 1912.
The language of the act is neither directory nor mandatory; it only authorizes the Secretary to sell-a discretionary power.
The title in fee to the reservation, under § 8 of the Act of
1882, became vested in the Indian tribe, and a patent in
fee should have been executed by the United States
July 10, 1909. The United States has no interest or title
in the lands of the reservation which the Secretary could
sell or convey under the Act of 1912. The Act of 1912 is
therefore of no force or effect. Chase v. United States, 238
Fed. Rep. 887, 890.

Opinion of the Court.

256 U. &

The fact that the United States neglected to perform a
ministerial duty, to-wit, to issue the patent in fee to the

tribe, did not reinvest the title in the United States nor
give the United States a right to sell the lands.
The proviso in § 8 of the Act of 1882, by which the
United States bound itself, at the expiration of the trust
period, to convey the reservation by patent to said Omaha
Tribe of Indians in fee discharged of said trust and free of
all charges or incumbrances whatsoever, was a contractual
obligation based upon ample consideration.

General, was on. the brief, for the United States.

Kappler was on the brief, for the Omaha Tribe of Indians,

MR. JusTcE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
Suit to adjudge Hiram Chase, Jr., a member of the
Omaha Tribe of Indians and to have a right to select
eighty acres for an allotment out of the lands of the
Omaha Reservation, the selection having been denied by
the Secretary of the Interior.
The right of selection depends upon the effect of certain
treaties between the Omaha Tribe and the United States
and certain acts of Congress.
The treaties were made in 1854 and in 1865, 10 Stat.
1043, 14 Stat. 667, and by them the Indians ceded certain
lands to the United States and certain other lands were
retained constituting the Reservation with which this
suit is concerned and of which the lands sought to be
allotted are a part.

CHASE, JR. v. UNITED STATES.
1.

Opinioni of the Court.

It was expressed in the treatyof 1865 to be the desire of
the Indians to abolish the tenure in common by which
they held their lands and to acquire tracts in severalty
of 160 acres to heads of families and 40 acres to each male
person of 18 years and upwards; and it was provided that
the whole of the lands so assigned or unassigned should
constitute and be known as the Omaha Reservation.
The assignments were to be approved by the Secretary
of the Interior, be evidenced by certificates, and be final
and conclusive.
In execution of the purposes of the treaty, Congress
passed an act in 1882 (22 Stat. 341) by which the Secretary
was authorized to allot the portion of the reservation lying
east of the Sioux City and Nebraska Railroad in severalty,.
to each head of a family a quarter section (160 acres); to
each single person over 18, one-eighth of a section; to each
orphan child under 18, one-eighth'of a section; and to each
other person under that age, one-sixteenth of a section.
The issue of patents was provided for, the lands to be held
in trust for 25 years for the sole use and benefit of the
respective allottees. And it was provided (§8) that the
residue of the lands should be patented to the tribe but
held in trust for 25 years, and then to be conveyed in fee
discharged of the trust. From these lands, however, it
was provided that allotments should be made and patented
to each Omaha child who might be born prior to the expiration of the 25-year trust period.
Under the act and prior to July 11, 1884, allotments
were made to 954 members of the tribe and patents issued
therefor. No patent was issued to the tribe as provided.
By the Indian Appropriation Act passed March 3,
1893, c. 209, 27 Stat. 630, and expressing itself to be an
amendment to the Act of 1882, the Secretary of the
Interior was authorized with consent of the Indian tribe
to allot in severalty ".

made in severalty to the members thereof under the
provisions of said act [1882], and now living, one-eighth of
a section of the residue lands held by that tribe in common, instead of one-sixteenth of a section, as therein
provided, and to allot in severalty to each allottee under
said act, now living, who received only one-sixteenth of a
section thereunder, an additional one-sixteenth of a
section of such residue lands.
.
Hiram-Chase, Jr., was not born until after the Act of
1893 waslpassed, and the question is, whether he is entitled to an allotment under it? The Government contends
to thq negative, basing the contention upon an Act passed
May 11, 1912, c. 121, 37 Stat. 111, which, it is the further
contention, repealed the Act of 1893, and cut off the right
of allotment.
The District Court yielded to the contention and dismissed the bill, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 261 Fed. Rep. 833.
Against this action of the courts appellant asserts
error, and insists that it and the contention of the Government are based on an underestimate of his rights and
upon a wrong construction of the Act of 1893.
First as to his rights. The contention is that appellant
had a vested right to an allotment "under the treaties and
acts of Congress as they existed at the time when " the
allotment was "selected and claimed" and this whether
the Act of 1912 repealed the Act of 1893 or was subordinate
to or complementary of its provisions. In support of the
contention appellant recites the various provisions of the
treaty of 1865 and the Acts of 1882 and 1893 and insists
that they are clear and direct investments of irrevocable
rights in pursuance of "a contractual obligation based
upon ample consideration." In specification the treaty of
1854 is adduced as having "ceded to the United States a
portion of the Reservation described in Article I" and
"by Article VI, individual Indians were to receive allot-

CHASE, JR. v. UNITED STATES.

ments of lands." This purpose, is the further contention,
was executed by the treaty of 1865 by which the Indians
"did 'cede, sell, and convey to the United States"' a part
of their Reservation, and among other provisions there
was one, expressed in Article IV of the treaty, for allotments to be "for the exclusive use and benefit of themselves [the Indians], their heirs, and descendants."
Of the obligations thus incurred, it is the insistence,
§ 8 of the Act of 1882 was the fulfillment, and at the expiration of the trust period the Reservation (residue)
was to be conveyed to the tribe "in fee discharged of
said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever" and that, therefore, the Act of 1912 which directed
the sale of the unallotted lands of the Reservation was
in contravention of the treaties and the rights to allotments thereunder and under the Acts of Congress of 1882
and 1893, supra.
The contention is one that has often been made in this
court and rejected as often as made. Gritts v. Fisher, 224
U. S. 640; Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665; Cherokee Nation
v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294. In those cases. the relation of
the individual Indian to the tribal property is explained
and also the power of Congress over that property and
the tribes. In the recent case of United States v. Chase,
245 U. S. 89, we had occasion to consider the Reservation
here involved and the effect of Article IV of the treaty of
1865 relied on by the appellant, and decided that its
purpose was to do no "more than to individualize the
existing tribal right of occupancy" and that it left "the
fee in the United States" and left "the United States and
the tribe free to take such measures for the ultimate and
permanent disposal of the lands, including the fee, as
might become essential or appropriate in view of changing
conditions, the welfare of the Indians and the public
interests."
The case dealt with assignments under Article IV, but

its principle necessarily applies to a mere right under the
Act of 1882. Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 557; Sizemore v. Brady, 235 U. S. 441; Cherokee Intermarriage
Cases, 203 U. S. 76; Wallace V. Adams, 204 U.'S. 415;
Stephens v. Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445.
The next contention of appellant is that he acquired a
vested right under the Acts of 1882 and 1893 assuming the
latter act did not repeal the other, and we are brought to
the Act of 1912. By that act the Secretary is "authorized
to cause to be surveyed, if necessary, and appraised, in
such manner as he may direct, in tracts of forty acres
each, or as nearly as to the Secretary may seem practicable, and, after such survey and appraisement, to sell
and convey, in quantities not to exceed one hundred and
sixty acres to any one purchaser, all the unallotted lands
on the Omaha Indian Reservation, in the State of Nebraska, except such tracts as are hereinafter specifically
reserved: Provided, That the said land shall be sold to the
highest bidder under such regulations as the Secretary of
the Interior may prescribe, but no part of said land shall
be sold at less than the appraised value thereof.
.
There is provision for the reservation from sale of certain
tracts with which this case is not otherwise concerned
except as it shows complete delegation of administration
to the Secretary. Appellant's contention is that the
act is neither directory nor mandatory; it is permissive
only and has been, it is said, so construed by the Secretary.
There are cases, however, that decide that an officer
"authorized" is an officer commanded in a matter of
public concern.1 Besides, there are words of direction in
the act and they are necessary to its purposes. But, if it

Opinion of the Court.

may be assumed there is a discretion in the Secretary, he
has exercised it against the appellant by denying his right
to an allotment, presumably in reservation of the land for
sale as provided in the act. And a sale is provided fora sale of the unallotted lands mentioned in § 8 of the
Act of 1882, and all of them. We agree, therefore, with
the Circuit Court of Appeals that the Act of 1912 "covers
so completely the subject of the disposition" of those
lands "that it must be held to have repealed that portion
of the Act of 1882 which authorized allotments to Omaha
children during the trust period." And, again quoting the
Court of Appeals, "the Secretary of the Interior, of course,
could not allot the unallotted lands under the Act of 1882,
and also sell them under the Act of 1912; nor could he
allot the unallotted lands and at the same time make the
reservations which he is commanded to make by section 2
of the latter act. It is so plain that both acts cannot be
carried out that it is unnecessary to discuss that question." It supersedes, therefore, that act though it contains no repealing words. United States v. Tynen, 11
Wall. 88; King v. Cornell, 106 U. S. 395; The Paquete
Habana, 175 U. S. 677, 685.
This appeal is a review of the second trial of the case.
In the first trial the District Court on motion of the
United States dismissed the bill. Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and
remanded the case to that court "with instructions to
permit the defendant [United States] to answer, if so
advised." 238 Fed. Rep. 887.
Upon the return of the case the United States set up
as a defense the Act of 1912 presenting the questions here
involved.
Appellant contends that the United States "having
relied at the first trial upon the single proposition that
the Act of 1893 repealed the Act of 1882, and thereby cut
off the right of these Indian claimants to allotments, and

256 U. S.

having failed in that defense, cannot, upon the second
trial, abandon that defense and insist that the Act of
May 11, 1912, repealed the Act of 1882."
The proposition has a relevant and conclusive application when a judgment of a former action is pleaded but
limited application when urged in the same suit, it expresses a practice only and useful as such, but not a
limitation of power. Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S.
436.
The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals,
having the power and exercising it, entertained the defense
of the Act of 1912, estimated it and decided it conclusive
against appellant's right to an allotment. As we have seen
there was no error in that ruling, and the decree of the
Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
