delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is like No. 147, just decided, ante, 163, and
was argued and submitted at the same time.
In this instance the Government and the landowner
appealed from the award of the commissioners, and the
case was tried to a jury. Jurors were instructed that the
allowance of interest was a matter of law, and in a form

of verdict given to them, interest at 6 per cent. was to,
be added from April 19, 1912, the date of appropriation.
It appears that by agreement a separate order requiring
the deposit of interest was entered in order to allow a
writ of error upon that point, and in connection with the
above form of verdict the jurors were instructed to assess
compensation as of the value of the land on April 19, 1912,
and not to add interest from that time to the date of the
verdict. Afterwards a final judgment was entered in the
District Court requiring a deposit of the amount of the
verdict, and a separate order was made directing payment-of interest from April 19, 1912. A writ of error was
prosecuted from the Circuit Court of Appeals where the
judgment of the District Court was affirmed. 257 Fed.
Rep. 401.
The Circuit Court of Appeals recited the facts of the
case, and held that it was ruled by United States v. Rogers,
No. 147, just decided. We agree with this conclusion,
and the jtidgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
