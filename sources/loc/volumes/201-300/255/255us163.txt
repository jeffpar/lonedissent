Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnett, with whom Mr.
Assistant Attorney General Nebeker and Mr. Charles S.
Lawrence were on the brief, for the United States:
The United States is not contractually bound for interest except by express agreenment. The implied' promise
is to pay the value of the property as of date of the taking,
without interest. An obligation to pay interest is not
implied. United States v. North American Transportation
Co., 253 U. S. 330.
While obligation to pay interest may be imposed by
statute, there is no federal legislation justifying addition
of interest as such to this award.
No authoritative case has been found holding that
the United States has adopted the local code in respect
of matters of substantive law. The quantum of compensation due for expropriation, of land'is a matter of substance. It is essentially a federal question, to be determined
upon construction of the Constitution and the statutes
of the United States and by independent application of
general principles of jurisprudence thereto. Carlisle v.

nation proceedings the similar provision found in § 914,
Rev. Stats. It was designed to bring about conformity
to state practice, and has no reference to substantive
rights or obligations.
Section 721, Rev. Stats., adopting state laws as rules
of decision in the federal courts in cases where they apply,
does not oblige the United States to pay interest made
legal by New Mexico, because her laws do not (even if
they purport to do so) confer on the United States power
to expropriate land within her borders. Nahant v. United
States, 136 Fed. Rep. 273, 276. Substantive rights and
obligations springing from federal laws even when, as
suitor, the Government asserts them in its courts, are
not subject, because of § 721, to either express or implied
limitation or definition by state authority. Carlisle v.

U. S. 486. Cf. Billings v. United States, 232 U. S. 261,284.
It is not only well recognized that the United States
is not obliged to pay interest except under express contract or statute (United States v. Ncrth Carolina, 136
U. S. 211), but, furthermore, no sovereign State is bound
to pay interest because payment of its - obligations has
been delayed. Interest as damages for detention .of money
(though sometimes recoverable from individuals) cannot
be added to obligations of the United States. United
States v. Sherman, 98 U. S. 565; Angarica v. Bayard, 127
U. S. 251, 260; United States v. Verdier, 164 U. S. 213,

It is also clear that if the .matter had been submitted
to the commissioners it would have been error to instruct
them that, as matter of law and-without further proof,
they might add interest at the fixed rate of six per cent.
as the equivalent of or in lieu of damages actually due
the landowner for loss of possession.
When interest at a fixed rate is added to the award
as a legal right, it is in substance and effect precisely.,

,the same thing as allowance of interest as damages for
delay in paying for the-land. Since it is evident the statutory rate of interest on loaned money is not always or
often the standard by which rental value-the actual
loss-can be justly estimatedi plainly the consideration
which induced its application in this case was that it Was
thought right to add interest for the detention of the
price of the lanct But this, however just in the abstract,
cannot be done in respect of a payment delayed by the
Government,
Assuming that it would-be just to allow it, it does not
appear from the record that any effort was made before
the commission or elsewhere to prove rental value or
other actual loss suffered. The burden of proving his
losses is on the landowner. 2 Lewis Em. Dom., 3rd ed.,
§ 645, pp. 11127-1115; 2 Nichols Em. Dom., 2nd ed., § 432,
pp. .1138-1140.
It should be noted that at any time after April 19, 1912,
the landowner might have sued. the United States under
§ 145 or §24 (par. 20), Jud. Code, treating, as he might,
the flooding as an expropriation vesting title to the land
in -theGovernment and vesting in him, eo instant, a right
of action on implied -contract. United States v. North

UNITED STATES v. ROGERS.
163.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.

The United States brought an action January 18, 1915,
in the District Court of the United States for New Mexico,
to condemn lands of the defendants in error for reclamation
purposes. 32 Stat. 388. Condemnation proceedings to
acquire real estate for Government uses and public purposes under judicial process are regulated by the Act of
August 1, 1888, c. 728, 25 Stat. 357.
Section 2 of the act provides that the practice, pleadings, forms and modes of proceedings in causes arising
under the provisions of the act shall conform, as near as
may be, to the practice, pleadings, forms and proceedings
existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record
in the State within which such circuit or district courts
are held.
The petition averred the necessity of appropriating the
lands in question; that the Secretary of the Interior had
determined to acquire the defendants' real estate; that
at the date of the completion of the work lands- nf the
defendants were flooded, and thereby appropriated - by
the United States under the authority of the acts of Congress; that the owners received no compensation; that
necessary funds were available to pay any damages which
might be awarded defendants. The petition prayed that
the court appoint commissioners to assess the damage
which the owners had sustained in consequence of the
taking and appropriation of their lands, and that upon
payment of the amount assessed the lands be decreed to
be the property of the United States from the date of the
appropriation thereof.
The award of the commissioners was filed February 3,
1917, 'and an order was entered July 27, 1917, directing
that the sums awarded be deposited, and distributed for
the benefit of the owners. Subsequently the owners
made a motion for a supplemental order requiring the

168

OCTOBER, TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

United States to deposit sums equal to 6 per cent. interest

on the awards, calculated from April 19, 1912, the time
when the lands were taken by flooding the same. The
court made an order requiring the deposit of the additional
sum, to which order the United States excepted, and
prosecuted a writ of error from-the Circuit. Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit, where the -judgment of the
District Court was affirmed. 257 Fed. Rep. 397.
It appears that the allowance of interest was fron the
time of the actual taking of the land to the time deposit
was made in payment for the-same.
The questions upon which the case was taken to the
Circuit Court of Appeals appear from the assignments
of error,' and are: (1) That the District Court erred in
awarding interest against the United States from April 12,
1912, to date of deposit of the awards in court, for the
reason that interest cannot properly be allowed in a
condemnation case against the United States for any
period prior to date of final judgment; (2) that the District Court erred in awarding interest against the United
States from April 19, 1912, to date of deposit of awards
in court, for the reason that interest cannot properly be
allowed in a 'condemnation case against the United States
for any period prior to date of the order of the court placing the United States in possession of the lands condemned;
(3) that the District Court erred in awarding interest
at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum against the United
States from April 19, 1912, to date of deposit of awards
in court, for the reason that there is no authority of law
for allowing interest at said rate on judgments against
the United States.
As we are reviewing the judgment of the Circuit Court
of' Appeals, the assignments of error -in that court are
the ones open here, and it is evident from what we have
said that the question in substance comes to this: Was
there error in awarding the owners interest on the value

Opinion of the Court.

of their lands appropriated from the time of actual taking of the same until compensation was made?
It is unquestionably true that the United States upon
claims made against it, cannot, in the absence of a statute
to that end, be subjected to the payment of interest.
Angarica v. Bayard, 127 U. S. 251, 260; United States v.
North Carolina, 136 U.- S. 211, 216, cited and approved
in National Volunteer Home v. Parrish,229 U. S. 494, 496.
In the present case the landowners did not sue upon a
claim against the Goverment, as was the fact in United
States v. North American Transportation& Trading Co.,
253 U. S. 330. The Government was seekink for purposes
authorized by statute to appropriate the ldnns, and it
had actually taken them, and had deprived the owners
of all beneficial use thereof from the date from which
the allowance of interest ran.
Having taken the lands of the defendants in error, it
was the duty of the Government to make just compesation as of the time when the owners were deprived of
their property. Monongahela Navigation Co. v..United
States, 148 U. S. 312, 341.
In fixing the compensation, the District Court, and
the Circuit Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment,
followed the New Mexico statute fixing the rate of interest
at 6 per cent. This was in conformity with a former
ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals applying the 'tatutes
of Minnesota to lands appropriated in that State. United
States v. Sargent, 162 Fed. Rep. 81.
The Government urges that the -Conformity Act of
August 1, 1888, does not require the United States Govern-.
ment to be bound by the rule of the state statute in the
allowance of interest. This may be true, but we agree
with the courts below that the allowance of just compensation by giving interest from the time of taking until
payment is a convenient and fair-method of ascertaining
the sum to which the owner of the land is entitled. The

fact. that the rule is in harmony with the policy of the
State where the lands are situated does not militate against
but makes for the justice and propriety of its adoption.
United States v. Sargent, supra.
We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals, and the same is
fAirmed.

This case is like No. 147, just decided, ante, 163, and

In this instance the Government and the landowner
appealed from the award of the commissioners, and the
case was tried to a jury. Jurors were instructed that the
allowance of interest was a matter of law, and in a form
