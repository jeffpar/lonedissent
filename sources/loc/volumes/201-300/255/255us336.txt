f913, c. 90, 37 Stat. 699) which prohibited the movement
in interstate commerce into any State of intoxicating

was sustained. It was held (a) that the. law in question

Opinion of the Court.

caused from differences in the laws of the several States
was to be attributed to such divergent state laws and
not to any inherent want of uniformity in the act of
Congress; (c) that it was competent for Congress, in
regulating commerce as to the movement of intoxicants,
to adapt its laws, as far as it deemed advisable, to the
regulations prevailing in the several States; (d) that in
regulating such commerce the authority of Congress was
as complete as that which government possessed over
intoxicants and was to bemeasured by the extent of such
power and not by the authority which controlled the
power of government as to other subjects.
In United States v. Hill, 248 U. S. 420, there came under
consideration an indictment for violating the statute
known as the Reed Amendment (Act of March 3, 1917,
c. 162, ยง 5, 39 Stat. 1058, 1069), prohibitingthe transportation in interstate commerce of intoxicating liquor
into any State whose laws prohibited the manufacture
or sale therein of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes.
Reiterating the grounds upon which the constitutionality
of the statute considered in the Clark Distilling Co. Case
was upheld, and additionally pointing out the reasons
why the statute under consideration was within the
authority of Congress to enact as a regulation of commerce, the indictment was sustained and the statute of
necessity upheld.
. The decided cases in this court and in the lower federal
courts which are noted in the margin 1 make it certain

Opinion of the Court.

255 U. S.

that the Clark Diailing Co. and the Hill Cases were
accepted as determining the validity of both the WebbKenyon Law and the Reed Amendment.
The case before us concerns an indictment found and
conviction thoreon had for a- iolation of the Reed Amendment after the decision in the Hill Case, and was brought
directly- here upon the theory that that law was repugnant to Art. I, ยง 9, cl. 6 of the Constitution, prohibiting
any regulation of commerce which gives a preference to
the ports of one State bver those of another. We do not
pause to consider whether the constitutional validity
of the Reed Amendment had been in terms so completely
settled by the Clark Distilling Co. and the Hill Cases as
to cause the contention here relied upon to be frivolous
at the time the writ of error was sued out, but content
ourselves with saying that, in any event, the want of
merit in the constitutional question relied upon is so
plainly and unequivocally established by the cases in
question and the authorities which have followed them,
as to require us to do no more than direct attention to
that condition and consequently to affirm the judgment.
Judgment affirmed.
