FISH SALTING & BY-PRODUCTS
COMPANY v. SMITH.

ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT, DIVISION NO. 1, OF THE
TERRITORY OF ALASKA.
No.'166. Argued January 20, 21, 1921.-Decided January 31, 1921.
1. In im osing license taxes upon the manufacture of oil and fertilizer
from fish, the legislature of Alaska, having in view the value of
herring as a food supply for men and for salmon, constitutionally
may discriminate against those persons who consume herring in
the manufacture, as compared with those who use other fish or
salmon offal. P. 48.
2. A license tax, otherwise valid, is not unconstitutional because it
destroys a business without compensation.' Id.
3. Held, that the purpose' of the legislature in enacting the tax laws
involved in this case must be gathered from the statutes and not
from the allegations in the bill attacking them, admitted by demurrer. P. 49.

4. The Act of August 24, 1912, c. 387, § 3, 37 Stat. 512, creating the
Alaskan legislative assembly and granting it power to alter, amend,
modify and repeal laws in force in Alaska, declared that such power
should not extend to 'the "fish laws" of the United States there applicable, or to laws of the United States providing for taxes on business or trade, and further declared that "this provision shall not
operate to prevent the legislature from imposing other and additional
taxes or licenses." Held: (a) That certain acts of Congress.imposing taxes on fish oil and fertilizer works based on output, (Alaska
Comp. Laws, §§ 2569, 259), are not "fish laws" within the meaning
of this limitation. P. 49. (b) That subjection of a particular industry to this congressional tax does not imply a license to continue
in business and thus prevent additional, even prohibitory, taxation
by Alaska under the broad power granted. Id. (c) That an additional tax by Alaska, being thus authorized, is not objectionable
as double taxation. P. 50.
5. A discriminatory license tax ut sup., par. 1, held consistent with
the command of § 9 of the said Act of August 24, 1912, that all
taxes shall be uniform on the same class of subjects. P. 49. '
,6. The provision of the same act, § 9, that no tax shall be levied for

TE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. R. E. Robertson for plaintiff in error:
The allegations of the complaint relating to the taxes
must be taken as true, because the case was decided upon
demurrer. Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 195 U. S. 223, 234;
American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty,
187 U. S. 94, 103; St. Louis v. Knapp Co., 104 U. S. 658,
661.
The Constitution is in force in Alaska, and inconsistent
local legislation is void.
It is the duty of the-judiciary to consider the real nature
and effect of legislation depriving citizens of constitutional

rights.
There is a gross and patent inequality in the amount
of the tax levied on the particular line of business carried
on by plaintiff in error as compared with the taa levied
on other lines of business.
The territorial legislation and the taxes imposed by
it are in violation of the Constitution, because the legislature has plainly abused its taxing power by exercising
it, not for revenue, but for the purpose of destroying
rights and privileges accorded to the plaintiff in error
by the Constitution and the Alaska Organic Acm;. Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., 184 U. S. 540, 563; Alaska

It being illogical to believe that plaintiff in error can
pay such a tax.and continue its business, it will come to
pass that, although Congress has legdized tLe business
by the Acts of June 6, 1900, and June 26, 1906, under
which taxes are paid into the National Treasury to be
expended in the Territory (Binns v. United States, 194
U. S. 486, 491), yet the local legislature, under an assumption of delegated power, has deprived the Federal Government of the revenue it would otherwise have received,
and has virtually repealed the congressional acts. See
Alaska Pacific Fisheries v. Alaska, 236 Fed. Rep. 52, 57.
Congress by the Act of June 26, 1906, authorized
plaintiff in error to carry on its business in the Territory
of Alaska. License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 471.
The territorial legislation and taxes imposed thereby
are also contrary to the .Alaska Organic Act; because
their effect is to amend, alter, modify and repeal the Acts
of June 6, 1900, and June 26, 1906; because they are not
uniform upon the same class of subjects and are not levied
and collected under general laws; because the assessments
axe not according to actual value,-in fact no assessments

were made; and because the taxes, although levied for
territorial purposes, are in excess of one per centum per
annum of any possible valuation which could be lawfully
assessed upon the actual value-of the property on which
they are levied.
Mr. J. C. Murphy, Attorney General of the Territory
of Alaska, for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HoImEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an action to recover the amount of taxes levied
under statutes of Alaska which the plaintiff alleges to be
contrary to the Act of Congress of August 24, 1912, c.
387, § 3, 37 Stat. 512, creating a legislative assembly in
the Territory of Alaska, and to the Constitution of the
United States. Judgment was given for the defendant
upon demurrer to the complaint, the parties agreeing
that the foregoing grounds of recovery were the only
matters in dispute. The statutes attacked, viz: May 1,
1913, April 29, 1915, and May 3, 1917, levy license taxes
of two dollars a barrel and two dollars a ton respectively,
upon persons manufacturing fish oil, fertilizer and fish
meal in whole or in part from herring. The act of Congress
after giving effect to the Constitution and laws of the
United States in the Territory provides that the authority
therein granted to the legislature "to alter, amend, modify,
and repeal laws in force in Alaska shall not extend to the
fish . . . laws . . . of the United States
applicable to Alaska, or to the laws of the United States
providing for taxes on business and trade, . .
Providedfurther, That this provision shall not operate to
prevent the legislature from imposing other and additional
taxes or licenses." Some reliance is placed also upon § 9
that all taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of
subjects, &c., and that no tax shall be levied for terri-

torial purposes in excess of one per centum upon the
assessed valuation of property therein in any one year.
The complainant alleges that the tax will prohibit and
confiscate the plaintiff's business, which is that of manufacturing fish oil, fertilizer, fish meal and by-products
from herring either in whole or in part; that the tax unreasonably discriminates against the plaintiff, as it levies
no tax upon the producers of fish oil, &c., from other fish,
and is otherwise extortionate; and that it contravenes
the act of Congress in lack of uniformity and in exceeding one per centum of the actual value of the plaintiff's
property. The prophecies of destruction and the allegations of discrimination as compared with similar manufactures from salmon are denied by the Attorney General
for Alaska, the latter denial being based upon a comparison
of the statutes which of course is open. We are content
however to assume for the purposes of decision that, not
to speak, of other licenses, the questioned acts do bear
more heavily upon the use of herring for oil and fertilizer
than they do upon the use of other fish. But there is
nothing in the Constitution to hinder that. If Alaska,
deems it for its welfare to discourage the destruction of
herring for manure and to preserve them for food for man
or for salmon, and to that end imposes a greater tax upon
that part of the plaintiff's industry than upon similar
use of other fish or of the offal of salmon, it hardly can
be said to be contravening a Constitution that has known
protective tariffs for a hundred years. Rast v. Van Deman
& Lewis Co., 240 U. S. 342, 357. Even if the tax should
destroy a business it would not be made invalid or require
compensation upon that ground alone. Those who enter
upon a business take that risk. McCray v. United States,
195 U. S. 27. See Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U. S.
59; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 482. We need
not consider whether abuses of the power might go to

Opinion of the Court.

such a point as to transcend it, for we have not such a
case before us. The acts must be judged by their contents
not by the allegations as to their purpose in the complaint.
We know of no objection to exacting a discouraging rate
as the alternative to giving up a business, when the legislature has the full power of taxation. The case is different
from those where the power to tax is limited to inspection
fees and the like, as in Postal Telegraph-CableCo. v. Taylor,
192 U. S. 64, 72.
But it is said that however it may be with regard to the
Constitution taken by itself, the statutes brought into
question are contrary to the act of Congress from which
the local legislature derives its power. In the first place
they are said to be an attempt to modify or, repeal the
fish laws of the United States. The Act of Congress of
June 6, 1900, c. 785, § 29, 31 Stat. 321, 331; Alaska Compiled Laws, § 2569; imposes a tax on fish oil works of ten
cents per barrel and on fertilizer works of twenty cents
per ton, repeated in slightly different words by the Act
of June 26, 1906, c. 3547, 34 Stat. 478; Alaska Compiled
Laws, § 259. But these are not fish laws as we understand
the phrase. It is argued, however, that at least they
import a license, License Tax Cases, 5 Wall. 462, 470, and
that a tax alleged to be prohibitory flies in their teeth. It
would be going far to say that a tax on fish oil works in
general terms imported a license to a specific kind of
works deemed undesirable by the local powers, and when
we take into account the express and unlimited authority
to impose additional taxes and licenses we are satisfied that
the objection should not prevail. We confine our decision
to the statutes before us, repeating in this connection
that they must be judged by their contents not by the
characterization of them in the complaint.
The requirement of uniformity in § 9 is disposed of by
what we have said of the classification when considered
with reference to the Constitution. The legislature was

warranted in treating the making of oil and fertilizer
from herring as a different class of subjects from the making of the same from salmon offal. The provisions against
taxing in excess of one per centum of the assessed valuation
of property does not apply to a license tax like this. This
is not a property tax. Alaska Pacific Fisheriesv. Alaska,
236 Fed. Rep. 52, 61. The objection that the plaintiff
in error is doubly taxed, first by the United States and
then by the Territory, is answered by the express authority
to levy additional taxes to which we have referred heretofore. Without going into more detail we are of opinion
that the tax must be sustained.
Judgment affirmed.

No. 171t.

Argued January 21, 1921.-Decided January 31, 1921.

1. The damages recoverable under the Trade-Mark Act for infringement of a registered trade-mark are limited to those inflicted after
the registration, and, if the notice of registration has not been attached to the mark, as prescribed by the act (§ 28), to those arising after the defendant was notified of infringement. P. 52.
2. Where the action arises wholly under the Trade-M4ark Act, diversity of citizenship being absent, the District Court is without jurisdiction to require an accounting for profits resulting from unfair

competition before the registration, or (semble) before the notice
conditioning liability to damages, ut aupra. Id.
