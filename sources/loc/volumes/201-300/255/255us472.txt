UNITED ° STATES v. CORONADO -BEACH
COMPANY.
ERROR TO AND APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.
Nos. 524, 525.

Argued March 1, 2, 1921.-Decided March 28, 1921.

1. The fifth section' of the Mexican Colonization Law of August i8,
1824, which declares the right of the federal government, .for the
defense or security of the nation, to make use of lands for the pur-pose of constructing warehouses, arsenals and other public edifices,
cannot be construed as reserving a power of expropriation without
compensation over land granted under the act to a Mexican citizen.
P. 485. ArgueUo v. United States, 18 How. 539.

2. The title to -tide and submerged lands acquired by the State of
California upon her creation was subject to prior Mexican grants,
and subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, under the
Private Land Claims Act of March 3, 1851, to determine whether
such lands, in any case before it, had been granted by the prior
sovereignty. P. 487.
3. A decree of the District Court construing the boundary calls of a
grant as including tide and overflowed lands adjacent to the granted
upland, 'and confirming it accordingly, was a valid exercise of the'
court's jurisdiction, even if the construction was erroneous, and is
not subject to collateral attack upon the ground that the Mexican
documents, correctly interpreted, confined the grant to the shore
line. P. 487.
4. In a suit by the United States to condemn rights deraigned under
a Mexican grant, confirmed, surveyed and patented under the Act
of March 3, 1851, supra,"'in which the Government claimed that
adjacent tide and overflowed lands, included, in the survey and
patent, were not in the original grant or the confirmatory decree,
and did not pass, held, that the confirmation and patent were conclusive, and that the Mexican map of the boundaries, which, with
the other documents of the grant, was referred to in the decree of
the District Court as defining it, was irrelevant. Pp. 487, 488.
'5. Held, further, that the patent could not.be collaterally impeached
by showing from the field notes that the line including the tide and

submerged lands was not surveyed; and that, considered as a direct
attack, the suit was barred by the limitation Act of March 3, 1891.

P. 488.
6. An expert witness to value in a condemnation case used maps and
drawings to illustrate his conception of the possible uses of the land.
Held, that if the plan so portrayed was remote and speculative, the

objection went to the weight of his testimony and not to such use
of the maps and drawings. P. 488.
7. Under the Act of July 27, 1917, c.42,40 Stat. 247, providing for the.
taking of the "whole of North Island " and for "the determination
and appraisement of any rights .private parties may have in said
island," and under the bill in this case following the-act, the Government took not merely the upland but the adjacent tide and overflowed lands as well. P. 489.
274 Fed. Rep. 230, -affirmed.

THE cases are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Garnet, -with whom Mr..
Charles S. Lawrence was on the briefs, for the United
States:
The Mexican Colonization Law of August 18, 1824,
by its 5th article, expressly reserved to the federal
government the right to make use of any portion of lands
within ten leagues of the sea coast, for the purpose of national defense. See Hall's Mexican Laws, §§ 488-502.
This applies to all of the national lands to be distributed
under this law, and not only to lands to be colonized by
foreigners. Arguello V. United States, 18 How. 539, did not
involve this question of the significance of the 5th article.
No good reason -can be perceived why the- general
government should not reserve tJae right to. use lands.
donated to its citizens equally with those donated to foreigners who colonize them, for. the purposes of national
security or defense if the emergency should arise. Indeed,
when it is considered that the citizens could be granted
lands by tlhe act of the governor of the territory alone on
the national boundaries or on the sea coast, and without

any supervision by the central governmeiit, there is more
reason for applying the provisions of the 5th article to the
lands of citizens than to those donated to foreigners for
colonization purposes, the latter being forbidden to settle
within twenty leagues of the national boundaries or ten
leagues of the sea coast without the approval of the supreme
general executive power. The practical interpretation of
the section sustains this view. Law of April 6, 1830 (Hall's
Mexican Laws, p. 108); Act of the State of Coahuila and
Texas, March 25, 1825 (Hall, p. 133); Report of Captain
H. W. Halleck, Secretary of State of the Territory of California, March 1, 1849' Rockwell's Spanish and Mexican
Law, p. 431 et seq.; Jones' Rep., Sen. Doc. No., 18, 31st Cong.

.Eldridge v. Trezevant, 160 U. S. 452, 463; -Los Angeles
Milling Co. v. Los Angeles, 217 U. S. 217.
The United States succeeded to this right, and has not
'since been divested of it,.:" to the land here in controversy,
either by the confirmation of the grant, Brown v. Brackett,
21 Wall. 387; Henshaw v. Bissell, 18 Wall. 255, 264; Boquillas Cattle Co. v. Curtis,213 U' S. 339, 344; Los Angeles
Milling Co. v. Los Angeles, supra, 227; or by laches; or by
force of the act limiting the time within which suits may be
brought to vacate patents.
These tide and submerged lands belong to the State of
California as a part of its sovereignty.
The sea and its shores are treated by the Spanish and
Mexican laws as bienes communes, incapable of private
ownership. Moreau & Carleton's -Partidas, ed. 1820,
vol. 1, tit. 28, pp. 334-7; White's New Recopilacion, ed.
1839, vol. 1, p. 46; vol. 1, Book 2, p. 70; Hall's Mexican
Laws, ed. 1885, c. iv, §§ 1463-1471, pp. 446-9.
While it may be that the crown or the congress of Mexico
could for the common benefit limit the general rule of the
civil law and grant the sea shore:for appropriate purposes,
'over v. Insular Gov'rnment, 221 U. S. 623, 629, this grant

was under the law of August, 18, 1824, for the colonization'
of territories of the republic (Hall, p. 147); Regulations of
November 21, 1828, ib, p. 149.
Under these there is no presumption to any power in the
territorial governor of California to grant lands below
ordinary high-water mark. The court must look to these
laws both for the power to grant and for the mode and
manner of its exercise. Whitney v. United States, 181 U. S.
104, 113; United States v. Cambuston, 20 How. 59, 63.
The Mexican patent not only does not contain an express grant of the tide lands or submerged lands, but provides that any inclosures of the land granted shall not
prejudice any crossings, roads and servitudes which existed
under the Mexican laws.
This would seem to be an express recognition that these
lands on navigable waters were subject to the servitudes
usual in such grants under. Mexican laws (see Hall's Mexican Laws, § 1468, p. 448; Moreau & Carleton's Partidas,
ed. 1820, vol. 1, tit. 28, law 6), and negatives any express
grant of title below ordinary high-water mark.
Carrillo's petition described the boundary as on the
"west by the bay and ship anchorage." The order of the
governor directing the issue of patent gives the boundary
as "the land known or named 'Isla' or peninsula, in the
port of San Diego towards the part of--of the anchorage."
The Mexican patent describes the boundary as,"west by
the bay or anchorage for ships, as explained by the map
which goes with the espediente."
The petition to the land commissioners shows that the
land had not been surveyed by the surveyor general (which
was only necesary in order that patent mightJissue on confirmed claims'under § 13 of the A ct of ivlarch 3, 1851, 9
Stat. 631), because "such survey from the nature of the
case being unnecessary, the boundaries being natural and
not to be mistaken."

Mexican patent, is not in the record in this case and seems
not to have been produced at the trial. A certified copy
thereof from the Land Office is here exhibited, and a copy
will also be found in the records of this court in the case of
United States v. Simmons, No. 224, at the December term,
1863. From this map, which the. Mexican regulations of
1828 required an applicant for a donation of vacant land
to file, it is evident that the shore line on the west is meandered and none of the bay is included, which makes clear
that the boundary given in the Mexican patent and in the
petition therefor as the "bay or anchorage for ships," or
"bay and ship anchorage," is but a description of the
navigable body of water which forms the west boundary of
the donation. Billings and others who petitioned the land
commissioners for a confirmation fully recognized this when
they asserted that the boundaries were natural and not to
be mistaken, and a survey of the land, in order to segregate
it from other land, was unnecessary.
That a Mexican grant bounded by the bay on navigable
waters adjacent does not extend over the submerged
lands or tide lands below ordinary high-water mark is too
well settled for argument. Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S.1,
29.
When California became a part of the territory of the
United States, unless there had been previous to that time
an express grant by the Mexican government of lands below ordinary high-water mark, (Shively v. Bowlby, supra,
pp. 13, 47,) such lands were held in trust by the United
States for the benefit of the future State. Weber v. Harbor
Commissioners, 18 Wall. 571 65, 66; Shively v. Bowlby,
supra;Knight v. United States Land Association, 142 U. S.
183.
While California was a territory of the United States,
although. Congress had power to grant for appropriate purposes titles or rights in soil below.ordinary high-water mark
of tide waters, it has never done so by general laws and has

adopted the policy of leaving the disposition of sovereign
rights in navigable waters -in the soil under them, to the
control of the States when admitted to the Union. Shively
v. Bowlby, -supra,pp. 47, 58.
It is settled, moreover, that when California was admitted to the Union September 9, 1850, she acquired absolute property and dominion over the soils under tide
water within her jurisdiction. .Shively v. Bowlby, supra;
Knight v. United States Land Association, supra, p. 183,
and cases there cited.
While, therefore, Congress might have expressly granted
or confirmed an imperfect Spanish grant of tide lands below ordinary high-water mark while California was a Territory, it had no such power after California became a State.
Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 How. 470, 478; Packer v. Bird, 137
U. S. 661.
In the decree of the District Court confirming the grant,
it is adjudged that the title of the claimants "to the lands
claimed by them, as set-forth and described in their petition
is a good and valid title; and that their claim to the
said land be, and the same is hereby, confirmed," and the
boundary of the land in question is given "and west by the
anchorage for ships according to the documents of title and
map-to which reference is had'..' No claim was specifically
made in the petition for the extension of the grant to lands
below high-water mark. On the contrary, the petition
alleges that the boundaries of the land were natural, and
not to be mistaken, and that a survey thereof is unneces-

sary,.
The question whether the grant embraced lands below
high-water mark,, therefore, was never presented to the
court, and no right to them was ever in the minds of. the
claimants at the time their petition was rejected
by the
land commissioners nor at the time it was confirmed by
thecourt. It follows that translation of title to.these tide
l8a"can not-be based upon this diecrqe becaus the-im.

confirmed in terms does not embrace them. Packer V.
Bird, 137 U. S. 661', 672.
. The decree of confirmation is limited to the extent of the
claim made and covered and protected nothing beyond.
Brown v. Brackett, 21 Wall. 387. It merely established the
validity of the claim as it then existed, it did not change
the character of the grant. Henshaw v. Bissell, 18 Wall.
255, 264.
Even if it purported to cover the submerged lands
fronting the uplands covered by the Mexican grant, the
special tribunal created by. the Act of March 3, 1851, 9
Stat. 631, had no jftrisdiction to determine the validity of
claims to submerged lands. It is true authority was conferred on this tribunal to determine the acreage of quantity
grants and the boundary of definite claims. United States
v. FossaU, 21 How. 445, 449. But this authority was limited to lands which, in case claims thereto were rejected by
the Commission or were not presented within two years
from the passage of the act, would then be "deemed, held
and considered as a part of the public domain of the United
States." This is made apparent when we consider § 13 of
the act.
The words "public domain" used here mean "public
lands" which are subject to sale and disposition under the
general land laws. Newhall v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761; Barker
v. Harvey, 181 U. S.- 481, 490; Mann v. Tacoma Land Co.,
153 U. S. 273, 284.
The object of the creation of the spepial tribunal to
settle private grants in California was to segregate themn
from the "public domain," and thus open up a vast area
of that domain in California to settlement under the homestead and prefmption laws. Botiller v. Dominguez, 130
U. S. 238, 249. There was no presumption in favor of the
jurisdiction of this special tribunal, and we must look to the
act creating it to determine its jurisdiction and to ascertain whether the power sought to be exercised is lawful.

UNITED STATES v. CORONADO BEACH CO. 479
472.

Argument for the United States.

United States v. Santa Fe, 165 U. S. 675, 714. This being
true, the jurisdiction of this tribunal to extinguish the
sovereign rights of California in its presumptive title to all
its submerged lands must clearly appear. The California
Enabling Act of September 9, 1850, c. 50, 9 Stat; 452, 453,
provides specifically that "all the navigable waters within
the said state shall be common highways, and forever free,
as well to the inhabitants of said state as to the citizens of
the United States."
There is no reported case, so far as we have been able to
discover, where the land commissioners of California passed
upon the claim of a private grantee to full ownership and
control of lands below ordinary high-water mark.
The field notes of the survey were not introduced. A
certified copy is here produced. These field notes form
part of the survey and are to be considered with the plat to
which they relate. Heath v.' Wallace, 138 U. S. 573, 583.
There is nothing in the Mexican patent, the petition .for
confirmation, the decree Of confirmation;or the terms of the
-patent from the United States, to disclose that any lands
covered by water were included or intended to be included
in the grant, but by examining the plat of survey it is observed that the surveyor general has run, on the western
boundary, two lines, one meandering ordinary high-water
mark on the shore, and expressly noted as such on the plat,
and the other out to the deep channel used by ships in
entering and leaving the harbor; and at one point beyond
the center of the bay of San Diego.
Examination -of the field notes shows that only one of
these lines was actually run upon the ground, to wit, that
marking the line of ordinary high-water mark; that the
surveyor erroneously assumed the description of the west
boundary in the decree required him to project the lines
to thedeep channel used by ships as shown by some map of
the CoastSurvey. Projecting these wasa mere paper survey and not-an actual survey on the ground.

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Argument for the United States.

255 U. S.

Returns by a surveyor general embracing the descriptions of a survey of land are prima facie evidence, and plats
and certificates, on account of the official character of the
surveyor general, have accorded to them the force and
effect of a deposition, United States v. Hanson, 16 Pet. 200,
201, but "it is not the mere assertion of a surveyor that he
had surveyed land that makes it so," Winter v. United
States, 30 Fed. Cas. 350; 365, and the admission of the
survey in evidence does not admit its validity. United
States v. Breward, 16 Pet. 143, 146.
The legal effect of a survey must be determined not by
what the surveyor said but by what he did. An actual
survey on the ground was essential to the validity of the
grant. Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Pet. 411, 441; Muse v.
Arlington, Hotel Co., 68 Fed. Rep. 637; United States v.
Lawton, 5 How. 10, 27; Scull v. United States, 98 U. S. 410,
419;
Furthermore a computation of the elements by which
the surveyor established these conjectural lines discloses
that these lines fail to close by a distance of approximately
465 feet. This inaccurate paper survey can not be held to
enlarge the terms of the decree and patent so as to embrace
lands which are not those specified in the decree and patent
as an island or peninsula. The submerged lands and the
high lands are naturally and legally separate and distinct,
were each separately surveyed by the surveyor general,
and'are separately shown on the plat of survey annexed to
the record. The decree of confirmation confirmed the
title to the island or peninsula as shown on the original map
filed with the espediente, which embraced only the high
land. The patent quotes the language of this decree in
describing the land according to this map. The descriptive
language of the patent referring to the subsequent survey
is "the tract of land embraced and described in the foregoing survey." As pointed out, this survey described two
tracts, one, land in its ordinary sense of visible high land,

UNITED STATES v. CORONADO BEACH CO. 481
472.

Argument for the United States.

the other, invisible land, the soil unde? the sea. To construe the patent as describing this invisible soil under the
sea is to give undue weight to an act of the surv. yor
wholly outside his official duty and toone expression in the
instrument at the expense of the rest of it, and to convict
the patent of glaring inconsistencies and of a clear departure from the terms of the decree of confirmation which it
was to effectuate.
The reasonable construction of the patent, in the light
of the original map and the decree of confirmation, as well
as from the terms of the patent itself, is that the act of the
surveyor general in separately platting on paper the soil
under the sea was "not wiihin the scope of his proper
official functions," and that the island or peninsula, "the
tract of land embraced and.. described in the foregoing
survey," title to which passed by the patent, was the fast
land as surveyed and monumented on the ground and as
indicated on the plat. This constrtiction harmonizes'all
parts of the patent, the Mexican grant, the decree, and the
policy of Mexico and the United States not to grant to
individuals the soil under the sea. It gives- the grantee all
the land actually surveyed.
It is respectfully urged, therefore, that the patent
properly construed does not embrace these submerged
lands. If, however, the patent can be construed as intending to embrace them, it is to this extent void and subject to collateral attack.
"Neither the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo nor patents
under the Act of March 3, 1851, are original sources of
private titles, but are merely confirmatory of rights
already, accrued under a former sovereignty." Los Angeles Milling Co. v. Los Angeles, 217 U. S. 217, 227, 233;
Boquillas Cattle Co. v. Curtis, 213 U. S. 339, 344.
The right to collaterally assail khe patent depends upon
whether the Land Department had jurisdiction of these
lands. Since the Department had neither by survey nor

patent the right to enlarge the grant, this, in turn, depends
upon whether there was an express grant of these tide and
submerged lands by the former government.
Upon the admission of California as a -State, no express
grant of such lands having been made by the former
government, such lands were not part of the-public
domain, nor in any sense subject to the control of the Land
Department or its power to determine any q.estion of
title thereto. Iowa v. Rood, 187U. S. 87, 93.
Defendant's right, title or interest, if any, in the lands
below high-water mark. are in any view subject to the
paramount servitudes and powers of the federal and state
governments to protect navigation, commerce, and -fishery.
Congress, did not authorize by the Act of July 27, 1917,
condemnation of the tide lands.
The United States was entitled tohavethe land above
high-water mark valued under proper instructions, as to
the title to, and character of ownership of, lands under
navigable waters fronting thereon.
Mr. P. F. Dunne, with whom Mr. Read G. Dilworth
was on the briefs, for defendant in error and appellee:
The grant to Carrillo was not subject to the alleged easement of occupancy for military and naval purposes. It
was not agrant to a foreign colonist or to an impresario,
but to a Mexican citizen.' United States v. Cervantes, 18
How. 553, 555. In Arguello v. United States, 18 How. 539,
it was held that the first eight sections of the law of 1824
"apply wholly to colonists and foreigners."
The alleged easement of occupancy, under article 5 of
the law of 1824, i attributable to the public lands, to the
vacant lands of the nation; it is not related to lands upon
which the State or Territory has already exercised its dispositive power, and which have passed, as a fact accomplished, into the vested right of private ownership.

The western boundary of "the whole of North Island"
is precisely defined- to include the tide land area, by the
United States patent *andthe plat of survey accompanying
the same and a part thereof. The State of California, as of
its sovereign status, never had title to these particular tide
lands; lying ingide of the boundary line fixed by the
United States survey which supervened upon the decree
of confirmation and accompanied the patent. These
particular tide lands, by elder and patented title, passed in
fee simple absolute to the Mexican grantee, or his successors in interest, pursuant to the confirmation of the Mexican grant. Jover v. InsularGovernment, 22t U. S.623, 629;

These cases arise out of a proceeding brought by the
United States under the Act of July 27, 1917, c. 42, 40
Stat. 247, for the double purpose of ascertaining the rights
of private parties in North Island in the harbor of San
Diego, California, and of condemning the whole of said
island for public purposes after the value of such rights has
been fixed and paid into Court. The proceeding was begun
by a bill in equity against the Coronado Beach Company.
In its answer that Company alleged titto to the whole
island, and after a hearing obtained a decree in its favor,
subject to the question of the rights of the United States
brought up by the appeal in No. 525. The case then was
transferred to the law side, the value of the plaintiff's
island was assessed by a jury, and a judgment was entered
that upon payment of $5,000,000 into Court within thirty
days the United States might, have a final order of condemnation. The writ of error in No. 524 presents thq questions raised in this stage of the case.
The title of the Corondo Beach Company is. derived
from a Mexican grant of May 15, 1846, to one Carrillo, a
Mexican citizen, the Company having succeeded to his
rights. At this point it is necessary to mention only that
Carrillo is given the right to enclose the land "without
prejudice to the crossings, roads, and servitudes." The
grant -was under a law of August 18, 1824, by the fifth

section of which," If for the defence or security of the nation the federal government should find it expedient to
make use of any portion of these lands for the purpose of
constructing warehouses, arsenalsi or other public, edifices,
it may do so, with the approbation of the general congress,
or during its recess with that of the government council."
Hall, Laws of Mexico, 148, § 492. The United States
interprets this as a reservation of power against all persons,
as one of the servitudes to which the Carrillo grant was
subject, and as a sovereign right to which it succeeded
when the land became territory of the Tjnited States. We
cannot accept so broad an interpretation. We need not
repeat the discussion, in Arguello v. United States, 18 How.
539, wherein it was laid down that the first eight sections
apply wholly to colonists and foreigners. The decision
immediately concerned the fourth section of the law, but
the ground for the construction given to it was that the
others obviously were limited as stated and that there was
no reason for giving to the fourth a greater scope. Moreover the second section states that "The objects of this
law are those national lards which are neither private
property nor belong to any corporation or town (pueblo),
and can therefore be colonized." United States v. Yorba,
- 1 Wall. 412. It is hardly credible that section five should
have been intended to reserve the right to displace private
owners, and wholly incredible that it reserves the-right to
do so without compensation, especially when it -is noticed
that by the law of April 6, 1$30, the value of lands taken
for fortification, &c., is to be credited to"the States. Camciu v. United States, 171 U. S* 277, 284, 285. Hall, Laws
of Mexico, 108, § 291.
The more serious questions arise on the writ of error and
concern primarily the extent of the grant; the main dispute
being whether the Company owns the tide lands in front of
the upland of the island. Carrillo's petition states as its
ground that he is in want of proper land for the breeding of

cattle and horses and asks the grant for a cattle farm of the
island or peninsula in question, bounded substantially as in
the subsequent grant, viz: on the north by the Estero of
San Diego towards the town, east, by the end of the rancho
of Don Augustin Meliso, south by the sea, and west by the
bay or anchorage for ships, as explained by the map which
goes with the espediente. On April 20, 1852, Billings and
others then holding the title petitioned the Commissioners.
to settle Private Land Claims, appointed under the Act of
March 3, 1851, c. 41, 9 Stat. 631, to confirm to them-this
tract of land. The petition was rejected by the Board but
on appeal the title was declared good and confirmed by the
District Court of the United States. The decree stated the
boundaries on the north, east and south as in the original
grant, and "west by the anchorage for ships, according
to the documents of title and map to which reference is
had." This decree was filed on January 12, 1857; on
May 7, 1867, after an appeal to this Court had been dismissed, there was a substitution of Peachy and Aspinwall
as parties, and on June 11, 1869, a patent was issued reciting the decree, a return with a plat of a survey approved.
under § 13 of the Act of 1851, and giving and granting to'
them the land described in the survey. The Mexican mapis not in the record and is not material since the plat
accompanying the patent of the United States shows the
line marking the "Anchorage for Ships," which includes
the tide lands in dispute.
The jurisdiction of the decree and, the validity of the
patent so far as they cover the tide lands is denied by the
United States,-a special reason being found in the fact that
California becam a State in 1850 and thereby acquired a
title to the submerged lands before the date of the decree.
But the title of the State was subject-to prior Mexican
grants. The question whether there was such a prior grant
and what were its boundarios'were questions that had to be
decided in the proceedings for confirmation and there was

jurisdiction to decide them as well if the decision was
wrong as if it was right. _The title of California was in
abeyance until those issues were determined, as the decree
related back to the date of the original grant. The petitioner asked a confirmation of the tract conveyed to Carrillo. The grant to Carrillo was bounded "west by the
anchorage for ships" and although it well may be that in
view of the purpose set out in his petition and the circumstances the grant could have been construed more narrowly, that was a matter to be passed upon and when the
decree and the patent went in favor of the grantee it is too
late to argue that they are not conclusive against the
United States. It is said that the field notes, not put in
evidence at the trial, show that the deep water line was not
surveyed, but was taken from the Coast Survey maps.
But however arrived at it was adopted by the United
States for its grant and it cannot now be collaterally impeached. Knight v. United States Land Association, 142
U. S. 161. San Franciscov. Le Roy, 138 U. S. 656. Beard
v. Federy, 3 Wall. 478. It was suggested that the bill
might be regarded as a direct attack. upon the patent;
but this probably was an afterthought and in any event
the attack would be too late. Act of March 3, 1891,
c. 561, §8, 26 Stat. 1099. United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., 209 U. S.447, 450.
A subordinate objection is urged to the admission of,
maps or drawings showing the adaptability of the island to
agreat system of improvements possible if the Coronado
Beach Company owned the submerged land. it is urged
that such improvements were speculative, remote, and not
shown to be commercially practicable.- But the !drawings
were admitted only to illustrate the opinion of the witness
as to value and were explained as meaning no more. If
the reasons for his opinion were inadequate they detracted
from the weight of his testimony but were not inadmissible
on that account.

Syllabus.

Finally it is contended that the Government took only
the upland. But the Act of 1917 provides for the taking

of "the whole of North Island" and for "the determination and appraisement of any rights private parties may
have in said island," and the bill follows the act and prays
that if the defendant company has any right to the tract or
any part thereof the right "and the whole thereof" may
be "appraised and condemned." We discover no error in

the proceedings below.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 257. Argued October 6, 7,,1920.-Decided March 28, 1921.
1. Lands "in place " granted to a State for the support of schools,
and subsequently included within a reservation by the United States,
are exchangeable for unappropriated, 'non-mineral public lands of
equal acreage outside the reservation, under the Act of February 28,
1891, c. 384, 26 Stat. 796, amending §§ 2275, 2276; Rev. Stats.
P. 493.
2. Although, under other general provisions (Rev. Stats., §§ 441, 453,
2478), the lieu lands are selected by the State under the direction
of the Secretary of the Interior, this implies no discretion in him or
in the Land Department to refuse approval of selections duly made,
their function here being purely the judicial one of determining
whether selections, with accompanying surrenders of base land, complied with the act of Congress and the Sefretary's directions, under
the conditions existing at the time when the selections were made
and completed. P. 496.
