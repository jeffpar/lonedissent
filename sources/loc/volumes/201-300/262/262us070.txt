so long as they were only the regular steps to the contemplated result. Getting the bill of lading stands no
differently from putting the goods on board ship.
Neither does it matter that the title was in Scholtz & Co.
and that theoretically they might change their mind and
retain the bats and balls for their own use. There was
not the slightest probability of any such change and it
did not occur. The purchase by Scholtz & Co. was solely
for the purpose of Delgado & Cia. and for their account
and risk. Theoretical possibilities may be left out of
account. In Railroad Commission of Louisiana v. Texas
& Pacific Ry. Co., 229 U. S. 336, the consignees might
have retained the goods at New Orleans instead of shipping them abroad. The fact that they came to New Orleans by rail from another place in the State made no difference. The same principle was applied in Texas &
New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Sabine Tram Co., 227 U. S. 111,
123. The overt act of delivering the goods to the carrier
marks the point of distinction between this case and Cornell v. Coyne, 192 U. S. 418. To put it at any later point
would fail to give to exports the liberal protection that
hitherto they have received; of which an example may be
seen in Thames & Mersey Marine Ins. Co. v. United
States, 237 U. S. 19.

APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 184.

Argued March 6, 7, 1923.-Decided April 23, 1923.

1. Under the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 143, 37 Stat. 797, authorizing
the Postmaster General to pay additional compensation, not exceeding five per cent., for transportation of mail on railroads on
and after July 1, 1913, for the remainder of the contract terms,

Opinion of the Court.

on account of increased weight of mails resulting from the parcels
post law, the decision of the Postmaster General upon the amount
of compensation to be allowed within the limit fixed was conclusive; and a railroad company, which accepted payment, under protest, of amounts so fixed, cannot claim more from the Government upon the ground that they were inadequate. P. 73.
2. Transportation of additional mail matter, resulting from the
parcel post, even if not requirable under contracts existing when
'the parcel post system was adopted, did not give the transporting
company a right to additional compensation, when it was done
voluntarily during a period (January 1, 1913, to June 30, 1913)
for which Congress has failed to allow such compensation. Act of
March 4, 1913, supra. P. 73.

General, with whom Mr. W. Marvin Smith was on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Prior to July 1, 1910, claimant entered into a contract
with the Post Office Department to carry the mails over
a part of its line for the period of four years from that
date. Prior to July 1, 1911, it entered into a like contract
to carry the mails over another part of its lines These
contracts were in form and substance similar to that involved in New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v.
United States, 258 U. S. 32, and other recent cases.' By
them the amount of compensation was fixed by a weighing prior to the date of the contract. While the mails

were being carried by claimant under these contracts, the
parcel post system was established pursuant to the Act
of August 24, 1912, c. 389, ยง 8, 37 Stat. 539, 557-559.
From the inauguration of the service, on January 1, 1913,
to the end of the contract periods, claimant carried the
parcel post together with the other mail. For rendering
this service, during the first six months, no additional compensation has been paid claimant. For rendering it during the remainder of the contract periods, claimant received, under later legislation, sums in addition to the
compensation provided by the contracts. These sums it
deems inadequate. On February 1, 1919, this suit was
brought to recover, as reasonable compensation for the
service rendered, the several amounts which it insists
should have been paid. The Government demurred to
the petition. The Court of Claims dismissed it on the
ground that there was neither a contract express or implied in fact, nor a law of Congress to support the claims
for additional compensation. The case is here on appeal.
The Act of August 24, 1912, provided that the establishment of parcel post zones and postage rates should go
into effect January 1, 1913. It increased the weight of
fourth class mail matter from four to eleven pounds and
the size to seventy-two inches in length and girth. It also
authorized further increases of the weight limit, by order
of the Postmaster General with the consent of the Interstate Commerce Commission. But that act, while it
authorized the Postmaster General to "readjust the compensation of star route and screen wagon contractors if it
should appear that as a result of the parcel post system
the weight of the mails handled by them has been materially increased," made no provision whatsoever for increasing the pay of railroads because of carrying parcel
post matter. Act of March 4, 1913, c. 143, 37 Stat. 791,
797, authorized the Postmaster General "to add to the
compensation paid for transportation on railroad routes

Opinion of the Court.

on and after July 1, 1913, for the remainder of the contract
terms" not exceeding five per cent. thereof per annum
"on account of the increased weight of mails resulting
from the enactment of" the parcel post provision of the
preceding year. The Postmaster General allowed claimant, under this act on some routes the full five per cent.;
on some less; on some nothing additional. But the latter
act, also, contained no provision authorizing additional
pay to the railroads for carrying parcel post matter from
January 1, 1913, to June 30, 1913.
First. That no recovery can be had for the period after
June 30, 1913, is clear. Before that date Congress had
made express provision for the additional compensation
and in so doing had limited the amount payable. The
power to grant or to withlold was, within the limit set,
vested in the Postmaster General; and his decision as to
additional compensation was conclusive except upon Congress. The protest alleged to have been made in August,
1913, against the amounts proposed to be paid for this
period, cannot avail claimant, New York, New Haven
& Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 123.
Second. The first six months' period presents a different situation; but the legal result is the same. There is
no claim of an express contract to pay additional compensation; nor is there any basis for a claim on a contract implied in fact. The petitioner alleges that the
parcel post matter was radically different in character
'Some further compensation was in fact made after the expiration
of the contracts, under later legislation. By Act of July 28, 1916, c.
261, 39 Stat. 412, 425 (passed after both contracts with claimant had
expired), the Postmaster General was authorized to make an additional payment not exceeding one-half of one percentum per annum
on account of the increased weight of mails resulting from his order
effective August 15, 1913, raising the weight limit to twenty pounds
and additional payment not exceeding one per cent. on account of
the increased weight' resulting from his order effective January 1,
1914, raising the weight limit to.fifty pounds.

from the ordinary mails as constituted before January 1,
1913. It may be, that claimant might legally have refused, for this reason, to carry the parcel post mail under
then existing contracts; even if additional compensation
had been offered. Compare United States v. Utah,
Nevada & California Stage Co., 199 U. S. 414; Hunt v.
United States, 257 U. S. 125.

But the petition contains

no allegation that it refused to perform this extra service,
unless the Government would agree to pay additional

compensation. The petition contains allegations apparently designed to show that objection to carrying the
parcel post matter would have been largely futile; 3 but

the allegations fall far short of showing a demand that
the parcel post matter be eliminated, or a protest against

carrying it under the conditions then existing.

If the

parcel post act, or other legislation, gives a right to com-

pensation, the refusal or failure of the Postmaster General
to allow the claim could not, of course, defeat recovery.
Compare Campbell v. United States, 107 U. S. 407, 411;
8 The petition alleges:
"Much the larger part of the mails on
petitioner's routes and on the routes of the other important railroad
companies were carried in post office cars, for which cars arrangements were made between the Post Office Department and the railroad companies independept of the contracts for mail transportation,
and, under such arrangements, such cars were in operation on petitioner's said routes at the time when the parcel post was established
and at the times when the increases in weight of the parcel-post
matter became effective. The greater part of the mails carried in
such cars were loaded into and out of the same by contractors or
other persons employed by the Post Office Department, over whom
petitioner and the other railroad companies had no control, and the
Postal Laws and Regulations (see. 1583) forbade that railroad employees should enter the post office cars when in motion for any other
purpose than the operation of the trains. Moreover, the parcel-post
matter was so confused with the other mails that the employees of
petitioner and the other railroad companies could not possibly have
distinguished them, and removed them from the post office cars, if
otherwise they had had opportunity."

ST. LOUIS S. W. RY. v. U. S.
70

Opinion of the Court.

United States v. Knox, 128 U. S. 230. But, unless there
is such legislation, claimant cannot recover without showing a contract, express or implied in fact to pay the extra
compensation. Compare'UnitedStates v. North American Transportation& Trading Co., 253 U. S. 330, 335;
Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575, 581. No basis for
such a contract is afforded by the further allegation that
when the Act of 1912 was passed, and when the parcel
post system was established, railroads, high officials of
the Post Office Department, and members of both houses
of Congress, in charge of postal legislation, understood
that Congress would provide additional compensation to
the railroads.
The legislation makes no provision for additional compensation to the railroads for the period prior to July 1,
1913; and its history makes clear that Congress concluded
not to allow any. For some time prior to the passage of
the Act of August 24, 1912, there had been much discussion in Congress concerning the pay of railroads for carrying the mail. The carriers urged generally that the pay
was inadequate; and there were proposals for increase of
compensation. On the part of the public, there was a
widespread belief that the railroads were overpaid; and
there were proposals to reduce the compensation. When
Congress passed the 1912 Act, it was not prepared to decide this controverted question. It, therefore, appointed
a special committee to enquire into the subject, and also
others, relating to parcel post, and directed the committee
to report at the earliest date possible. Meanwhile, the
discussion continued in Congress. That the parcel post
would result in largely increased weight of mail was repeatedly asserted; but it was insisted that the pay under
existing contracts would give the railroads even more
compensation than they deserved. The fact was recognized that the appropriation bill enacted March 4, 1913,
provided increased pay only for parcel post service ren-

dered after June 30, 1913.' The failure of Congress to
make any provision for the preceding six months was not
inadvertent. It was the deliberate purpose of Congress
not to give the railroads additional pay for carrying the
parcel post mail during that period.'
The case at bar is wholly unlike Freund v. United
States, 260 U. S. 60; United States v. Utah, Nevada &
CaliforniaStage Co., 199 U. S. 414, and Hunt v. United
States, 257 U. S. 125, on which claimant relies. In each
of those cases there was ample power in the Postmaster
General to pay the additional compensation claimed. In
each the main question presented was whether under the
proper construction of the contract claimant was entitled to additional pay. Moreover, in each, the contractor had by proper protest preserved his rights; and
there was perhaps an element of duress. Here, as in
Sutton v. United States, 256 U. S. 575, the Department
had been denied power to pay an additional sum; there

was no protest by the contractor against assuming the
additional service; and there was no duress. The service
was undertaken voluntarily; no doubt, in the expectation
that Congress would provide additional compensation.
It made some provision; but concluded not to make any
for the first six months. We may not enquire into the
reasons for this refusal, or undertake to revise its judgment. The obstacle to recovery is not strictly lack of
jurisdiction in the Court of Claims. There was an express contract between the parties; there was also legislation; and on these the claim is founded. The obstacle
to recovery is lack of legal merits. The Government did
not in fact promise to pay for the extra service; nor did
the legislation give to claimant a right to compensation.
In other words, the petition fails to set out a cause of
action.
