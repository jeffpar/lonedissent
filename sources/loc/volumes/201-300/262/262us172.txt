APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

Nos. 560-566.

Argued December 6, 7, 1922.-Decided May 7, 1923.

1. The tax imposed by Laws of Minnesota, 1921, c. 223, on the
business of mining iron ore, measured by a percentage of the value
of the ore mined or produced, is an occupation tax. P. 176.
2. The mining of ore, even when substantially all of the ore mined is
immediately and continuously loaded on cars and shipped into
other States to satisfy existing contracts,-is not interstate commerce and is subject to local taxation. P. 177.
3. The facts that the Minnesota tax, supra, applies only to those
engaged, as owners or lessees, in mining or producing ores on their
own account, and not to those who do mining work for them

under contract and whose pay is part of the expenses of the
business, and that it does not apply to owners or lessees who do
development work but remove no ore,--do not bring it in conflict with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or with ยง 1 of Art. 9 of the Minnesota Constitution, providing that taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects. P. 179.
4. The question whether a provision of this Minnesota law allowing the amount of royalties paid on the ore mined and produced
during the year to be deducted from the value of such ore before
computing the tax, introduces an unconstitutional discrimination
in favor of those who operate under leases and. pay royalties and
against owners who operate their own mines and pay no royalties,
cannot be raised in this case, it appearing that all of the iron
mines in the State are operated under such leases, except six which
were not operated during the tax year in question and are not
threatened with a tax for that or later years. โข P. 180.
5. A tax based on the value of ore mined and produced, after deducting royalties and major expenses of the business, cannot be
adjudged arbitrary or unreasonably discriminatory merely because of lack of uniformity in royalties and expenses producing
corresponding differences in the tax. P. 181.

Mr. Egbert S. Oakley and Mr. Patrick J. Ryan, with
whom Mr. Clifford L. Hilton, Attorney General of the
State of Minnesota, and Mr. Montreville J. Brown were
on the brief, for appellees.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the Court.
These are suits to restrain and prevent the enforcement of a taxing act adopted by the State of Minnesota,
April 11, 1921, c. 223, Laws 1921. The principal sections
of the act are copied in the margin ' and may be summarized as follows: The first subjects all who are "engaged
in the business of mining or producing iron ore or other
1" Section 1. Every person engaged in the business of mining or
producing iron ore or other ores in this state shall pay to the state of
Minnesota an occupation tax equal to 6 per cent of the valuation of
all ores mined or produced, which said tax shall be in addition to all
other taxes provided for by law, said tax to be due and payable from
such person on May 1 of the year next succeeding the calendar year
covered by the report thereupon to be filed as hereinafter provided.
"Sec. 2. The valuation of iron or other ores for the purposes of
determining the amount of tax to be paid under the provisions of
Section 1 of this act shall be ascertained by subtracting from the value
of such ore at the place where the same is brought to the surface
of the earth, such value to be determined by the Minnesota tax commission:
" 1. The reasonable cost of separating the ore from the ore body,
including the cost of hoisting, elevating, or conveying the same to the
surface of the earth.
"2. If the ore is taken from an open pit mine, an amount for each
ton of ore mined or produced during the year equal to the cost of
removing the overburden, divided by the number of tons of ore
uncovered, the number of tons of ore uncovered in each such case
to be determined by the Minnesota Tax Commission.
"3. If the ore is taken from an underground mine, an amount for
each ton of ore mined or produced during the year equal to the cost
of sinking and constructing shafts and running drifts, divided by the
number of tons of ore that can be advantageously taken out through
such shafts and drifts, the number of tons of ore that can be advan-

ores" within the State to the payment in each year of
"an occupation tax "'equal to 6 per cent. of the value of
the ore mined or produced during the preceding year,such tax to be "in addition to all other taxes." The second directs that the tax be computed on the value of the
ore at the place where it is "brought to the surface of the
earth" less certain deductions to be noticed presently.
The third requires all who are engaged in such business
to make on or before the first of February in each year a
true report under oath of relevant information respecting
their mining operations during the preceding year. And
the sixth provides that where such a report is not made
the State Tax Commission shall determine, from such information as it may possess or obtain, the amount and
tageously taken out in each such case to be determined by the Minnesota Tax Commission.
"4. The amount of royalties paid on the ore mined or produced
during the year.
"5. A percentage of the ad valorem taxes levied for said year
against the realty in which the ore is deposited equal to the percentage
that the tons mined or produced during such year bears to the total
tonnage in the mine.
"6. The amount or amounts of all the foregoing subtractions shall
be ascertained and determined by the Minnesota Tax Commission.
"Sec. 3. Every person engaged in such mining or production of
ores shall, on or before the first day of February, 1922, and annually
thereafter on or before the first day of February of each year, file
with said commission under oath a correct report in such form and
containing such information as the tax commission may require, covering the preceding calendar year."
"Sec. 6. If any person, subject to this act, shall fail to make the
report provided for in section 3 hereof at the time and in the manner therein provided, the tax commission shall in such case, upon such
information as it may possess or obtain, ascertain the kind and
amount of ore mined or produced, together with the valuation thereof,
and shall thereon find and determine the amount of the tax due from
such person, and there shall be added thereto a penalty for failure
to report, which penalty shall equal ten per cent of the tax imposed
and shall be treated as a part thereof."

value of the ore and shall compute the tax and include
therein a penalty of 10 per cent. for the failure to make
the report.
The plaintiffs are corporations engaged in the business
of mining or producing iron ore from mines within the
State, and the defendants are the officers designated to
carry the act into effect.
Preparatory to assessing the tax in 1922 the defendants
requested the plaintiffs to make the prescribed reports of
their mining operations during 1921, which the plaintiffs
refused to do because they conceived that the act was
invalid. The defendants then proceeded to take the
requisite steps for imposing the tax, and the plaintiffs
brought these suits to restrain and prevent such action on
the grounds that the act and the tax about to be imposed
were in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States, with the equal protection
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and with a clause
in ยง 1 of article 9 of the state constitution providing
"Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects."
The cases were heard together on an agreed statement
of facts and some supplemental evidence which was free
from conflict. One of the matters stipulated was that
the suits were brought in circumstances making them cognizable in equity. The District Court sustained the act
and the tax and dismissed the suits on the merits. The
cases are here on direct appeals by the plaintiffs under
ยง 238 of the Judicial Code.
The parties differ about the nature of the tax, the
plaintiffs insisting it is a property tax and the defendants
that it is an occupation tax. Both treat the question as
affecting the solution of other contentions. There has
been no ruling on the point by the Supreme Court of the
State. We think the tax in its essence is what the act
calls it-an occupation tax. It is not laid on the land
containing the ore, nor on the ore after removal, but on

OLIVER IRON CO. v. LORD.
172

Opinion of the Court.

the business of mining the ore, which consists in severing
it from its natural bed and bringing it to the surface where
it can become an article of commerce and be utilized in
the industrial arts. Mining is a well recognized business
wherein capital and labor are extensively employed. This
is particularly true in Minnesota. Obviously a tax laid
on those who are engaged in that business, and laid on
them golely because they are so engaged, as is the case
here, is an occupation tax. It does not differ materially
from a tax on those who engage in manufacturing. Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, 231 U. S.399, 414; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., 240 U. S. 103, 114. The
plaintiffs regard Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries& Warehouse Co., 255 U. S. 288, as making the other way. But
that case is not in point. The tax there considered, as the
opinion shows (pp. 292-294), was not laid on any business, but on the mere exertion by an owner of distilled
spirits of his right to withdraw them from a bonded warehouse, and had none of the ordinary incidents of an occupation tax."
We shall therefore treat the ta4 as an occupation tax
in dealing with the contentions presented.
The chief contention is that mining as conducted by
the plaintiffs, if not actually a part of interstate commerce, is so closely connected therewith that to tax it is
to burden or interfere with such commerce, which a State
cannot do consistently with the commerce clause of the
Constitution of the United States.
The facts on which the contention rests are as follows:
The demand or market within the State for iron ore
covers only a negligible percentage of what is mined by
the plaintiffs.2 Practically all of their output is mined
to fill existing contracts with consumers outside the State
'In 1921, out of a total output of 18,167,370 tons the amount sold
and used within the State was 261,622 tons.

and passes at once into the channels of interstate commerce. Three-fourths of it is from open pit mines and
one-fourth from underground mines. At the open pit
mines empty cars are run from adjacent railroad yards
into the mines and there loaded. Steam shovels sever
the ore from its natural bed and lift it directly into the
cars. When loaded the cars are promptly returned to
the railroad yards, where they are put into trains which
start the ore on its interstate journey. The several steps
follow in such succession that there is practical continuity
of movement from the time the ore is severed from its
natural bed. The operations within the mine and the
movement of the cars into and out of the mine are conducted by the plaintiffs. The subsequent transportation
is by public carriers. At the underground mines the
plaintiffs dig the ore, bring it to the surface through shafts
and put it in elevated pockets where it readily can be
loaded into cars. The subsequent movements are much
the same as at the open pit mines, but their continuity
is not so pronounced. Some of the ore from both kinds
of mines-between 10 and 20 per cent.-is concentrated
by washing or beneficiated after coming out of the mine
and before starting out of the State, but our conclusion
respecting the usual operations renders this deflection
immaterial.
Plainly the facts do not support the contention. Mining is not interstate commerce, but, like manufacturing,
is a local business subject to local regulation and taxation.

contractual engagements, and persists even though the

business be conducted in close connection with interstate
commerce. Cornell v. Coyne, 192 U. S. 418; Browning v.
Waycross, 233 U. S. 16, 22; Delaware, Lackawanna &
Western R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, supra; General Railway

Co. v. Mississippi, 257 U. S. 129, 136; Heisler v. Thomas
Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245.
The ore does not enter interstate commerce until after
the mining is done, and the tax is imposed only in respect
of the mining. No discrimination against interstate commerce is involved. The tax may indirectly and incidentally affect such commerce, just as any taxation of railroad
and telegraph lines does, but this is not a forbidden burden or interference.
The contentions made under the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment and under the state
constitutional provision that "Taxes shall be uniform
upon the same class of subjects" present a question of
classification and have been argued together.
Consistently with both provisions the legislature of the
State may exercise a wide discretion in selecting the subjects of taxation, particularly as respects occupation taxes.
It may select those who are engaged in one class of business and exclude others, if all similarly situated are
brought within the class and all members of the class are
dealt with according to uniform rules. Southwestern Oil
Co. v. Texas, 217 U. S. 114, 121; State ex rel. v. Parr,
109 Minn. 147, 152. Here the selection is of all who are
engaged in mining or producing ores on their own account, that is to say, as owners or lessees. The selection
seems to be an admissible one, so we turn to the objections
urged against it.
One is that contractors who strip off the overburden of
soil, gravel, etc., in open pit mines, other contractors who

load the ore in such mines into cars and still others,
usually four in a group, who take ore out of underground
mines, are not included. But none of these are engaged
in mining on their own account. Instead they are working for those who are so engaged. However important
their service, they are not principals in the business, but
employees; and their pay, whatever it be, is part of the
expense of the business. Their omission has a reasonable
basis.
Another objection is that all owners and lessees who
mine or produce ore are included while those who do extensive development work, but remove no ore, are
omitted. This is not fairly subject to criticism. Equality
does not require that unproductive mining be taxed along
with productive mining. Besides, if ore is uncovered or
made accessible by such development work the tax will
be imposed when the ore is mined.
Among the deductions which the act provides shall be
made from the value of the ore before computing the tax
is "The amount of royalties paid on the ore mined and
produced during the year." This provision is assailed as
working a serious discrimination in favor of those who
operate under leases and pay royalties, as all the lessees
do, and against owners who operate their own mines and
pay no royalties. The question is an important one and
has not been before the Supreme Court of the State. It
apparently requires a construction of the particular provision along with other parts of the act, and possibly of
the state constitutional provision. After that it may be
that there would be need for turning to the Fourteenth
Amendment. "Only those whose rights are directly
affected can properly question the constitutionality of a
state statute and invoke our jurisdiction in respect thereto." Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S. 610, 621; Hatch v.
Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 160; Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531, 544. The record shows that of
the many iron mines in the State all but six are operated

OLIVER IRON CO. v. LORD.
172

181

Opinion of the Court.

under leases and that none of the six was operated in any
way during 1921, the year in respect of which the tax was
about to be imposed when these suits were begun. Therefore no tax could be imposed in respect of the six mines
based on that year's operations, and it is made plain that
the defendants have no purpose to impose one. It cannot be merely assumed that mining has been resumed at
those mines nor that any tax in respect of them for later
years is now threatened. The situation in these cases is
therefore such that none of the plaintiffs is entitled to
invoke a decision of the question. We accordingly leave
it entirely open.
It also is said that the royalty provision and others
respecting deductions will work a discrimination as between different lessees in that some will be subjected to a
higher tax than others. No doubt there will be differences in the amount, but they will result from differences
in situation and not from differences in treatment. Some
lessees pay higher royalties than others and will secure
a higher deduction on that score. Some are subjected.
to greater expense in mining than others and will secure reductions accordingly. And some are subjected to
higher local taxes on their mines than others-the mines
being scattered through several counties and minor
municipal subdivisions-and this will cause the deductions to vary. But all lessees will have the benefit of
deductions adjusted to the royalties, expenses and taxes
actually paid; and the value of the ore, according to
which the tax will be computed, will in each instance
be its actual value when it is brought out of the mine
less those deductions. In short, the tax is to be adjusted
to the value of the output less the major expenses of
the business, and this according to uniform rules. We,
therefore, cannot say that it is intended to or will work
any arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination as between
different lessees.
Decrees affirmed.
