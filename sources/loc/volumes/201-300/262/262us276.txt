STATE OF MISSOURI EX REL. SOUTHWESTERN
BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY v. PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF MISSOURI, ET AL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

No. 158.

Argued December 8, 1922.-Decided May 21, 1923.

1. Rates fixed by state authority for a public utility corporation
must be such as will yield a fair return upon the value of its
property devoted to the public service. P. 287.
2. What will amount to a fair return cannot be ascertained by valuing the property as of past times without giving consideration to
greatly increased costs of labor, supplies, etc., prevailing at the
time of the investigation. Id.
3. An honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values is
also essential, and this cannot be made if the highly important
element of present costs be wholly disregarded. Id.
4. Rates admitting of a possible return of but 51%, in net profits
after allowing for depreciation, on the minimum value of the prop-

erty of a telephone company, held wholly inadequate, considering
the character of the investment and the interest rates then prevailing. P. 288.
5. A state commission, in fixing the rates of a public utility corporation, cannot substitute its judgment for the honest discretion of
the company's board of directors respecting the necessity and reasonableness of expenditures made in the operations of the company. Id.

ERROR to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri
affirming a judgment of the State Circuit Court, which
sustained an order by which the Public Service Commission undertook to reduce the rates of the above-named
telephone company and to abolish installation and moving charges.
Mr. Frederick W. Lehmann, with whom Mr. J. W.
Gleed, Mr. Thos. 0. Stokes, Mr. Claude Nowlin and
Mr. E. W. Clausen were on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.
The value of the property found by the Commission
was not its present value, but was its actual cost, or its
value in 1913, plus net additions since, its present value
being ignored, the value found being far below the present
value of the property, with the result that the rates prescribed were confiscatory in their effect and operation.

The findings of the Conmnission as to the value of the
property were made under a mistake of law, are entirely
without support in the evidence, and are against the evidence of indisputable character in the case. The rates
prescribed by the Commission are therefore without legal
effect and void. §§ 10502, 10511 (2), R. S. Mo. 1919;

& Nashville R. R. Co., 227 U. S. 88.
The Commission's calculation of expenses was far
below what was actually and necessarily incurred in the
operation of the property and resulted in a showing of
net earnings far beyond what was realized, and, the reduced rates being predicated on such showing, there was
a taking and appropriation of the Company's property
without due process of law and a denial of the equal
protection of the law.
The annual charge for depreciation is estimated by the
Commission upon an undervaluation of the property and
is entirely inadequate.
Increase in wages made in July and August, 1919, were
not taken into full account by the Commission.
The four and one-half per cent payment under the
license contract with the American Telephone & Telegraph Company is a legitimate item of expense. Houston v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 259 U. S. 318; Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. v. Manning, 186 U. S. .239;

Mr. L. H. Breuer and Mr. James D. Lindsay for defendants in error.
The Supreme Court of Missouri gave to the findings
of the Commission no more weight than that of a presumption of right action, and asserted and exercised the
right to review the evidence for itself, and to make its
own findings of fact, unhampered by the findings of the
Commission. § 10522, R. S. Mo. 1919; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Public Service Comm., 266 Mo,

Upon writ of error to the highest court of the State,
this Court will not review the evidence further than to
ascertain that the finding of facts by the state court, upon

The Supreme Court of Missouri found, upon a review of
the evidence, that the rates established by the Commission were not confiscatory, nor unreasonable, and that
the rates were calculated upon the basis of the fair value
of the property of the company, being used and useful in
the service of the public. These findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, are not arbitrary nor
capricious, and will not be set aside by this Court upon
writ of error. San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper,

The decision of the highest court of the State, upon a
review of all the evidence, sustaining the orders of an
administrative commission, which are temporary in effect
and duration, and which expressly give to the complainant the right at any time thereafter, without prejudice, to
reopen the issues involved, should not be set aside upon
review on writ of error, solely because the Court may
differ in its view as to where lies the greater weight of the
evidence, or the more expedient solution of the administrative issues involved. Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v.
Cedar Rapids, 223 U. S. 655; Galveston Electric Co. v.

318.
There is no constitutional or inherent right in the utility
company, on the one hand, or, in the public, on the other,
which imperatively demands that the fair value of property devoted to a public service, shall be determined upon
estimated cost of reproduction new, either in a time of

Opinion of the Court.

abnormally high prices, or in a time of abnormally low
prices; and a finding made in view of the various tests
of value, supported by substantial evidence, and approved upon judicial review by the highest court of a
State, should not be set aside because the state commission and the state court did not approve a valuation made
at prices prevailing in an abnormal period; and particularly so, when the findings are tentative, and the rates
temporary, and a reopening of the issues is expressly permitted. Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466; Minnesota Rate
Cases, 230 U. S.351; Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. v. Public
Service Comm., P. U. R. 1918 F, 335.
A net return of 6.81 per cent is not confiscatory, nor
unreasonable; and particularly so, under an order tentative and temporary in character and duration. Federal
Control Act, as amended, 40 Stat. 451, §§ 1, 16; Interstate
Commerce Act, § 15-a, added by Transportation Act

U. S.19; Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U. S.
178; Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U. S.256.
The disallowance of installation and moving charges
is not reversible error, the revenue from other sources not
being unreasonably low.
The allowance of such charges was not mandatory
upon the Commission. Their allowance or disallowance
is a question of expediency or policy of regulation, and
not of power, or of undue interference with the management of the property. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v.

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Supreme Court of Missouri (233 S. W. 425)
affirmed a judgment of the Cole County Circuit Court

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

262 U. S.

which sustained an order of the Public Service Commission of Missouri, effective December 1, 1919. That order
undertook to reduce rates for exchange service and to
abolish the installation and moving charges theretofore
demanded by plaintiff in error. It is challenged as confiscatory and in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment.
During the period of federal control-August 1, 1918,
to August 1, 1919-the Postmaster General advanced the
rates for telephone service and prescribed a schedule of
charges for installing and moving instruments. The Act
of Congress approved July 11, 1919, c. 10, 41 Stat. 157.
directed that the lines be returned to their owners at
midnight July 31, 1919, and further"That the existing toll and exchange telephone rates
as established or approved by the Postmaster General on
or prior to June 6, 1919, shall continue in force for a
period not to exceed four months after this Act takes
effect, unless sooner modified or changed by the public
authorities-State, municipal, or otherwise-having control or jurisdiction of tolls, charges, and rates or by contract or by voluntary reduction."
August 4, 1919, the Commission directed plaintiff in
error to show why exchange service rates and charges for
installation and moving as fixed by the Postmaster General should be continued. After a hearing, it made an
elaborate report and directed that the service rates should
be reduced and the charges discontinued.
The Company produced voluminous evidence, including its books, to establish the value of its property dedicated to public use. The books showed that the actual
cost of "total plant, supplies, equipment and working
capital," amounted to $22,888,943. Its engineers estimated the reproduction cost new as of June 30, 1919,
thus-Physical telephone property, $28,454,488; working
capital, $1,051,564; establishing business, $5,594,816;
total $35,100,868. They also estimated existing values

S. W. TEL. CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM.

Opinion, of the Court.

(after allowing depreciation) upon the same date-Physical telephone property, $24,709,295; working capital,
$1,051,564; establishing business, $5,594,816; total,
$31,355,675.
The only evidence offered in opposition to values
claimed by the Company, were appraisals of its property
at St. Louis, Caruthersville and Springfield, respectively,
as of December 1913, February .1914 and September 1916,
prepared by the Comnission's engineers and accountants,
together with statements showing actual cost of additions
subsequent to those dates.
Omitting a paragraph relative to an unimportant reduction-$17,513.52--from working capital account, that
part of the Commission's report which deals with property
values follows.
"The Company offered in evidence exhibits showing
the value of its property in the entire State (outside the
cities of Kansas City and Independence, whose rates are
not involved in this case), and also at forty-six of its local
exchanges in the State. It shows by such exhibits that
the value of the property in the entire State (and when
speaking of the property in the State in this report we
mean exclusive of Kansas City and Independence) is as
follows: Reproduction cost new, $35,100,471; reproduction cost new, less depreciation, $31,355,278; and cost as
per books, $22,888,943. It also shows the Company's
estimate of reproduction cost new, reproduction cost new
less depreciation, and the prorated book cost, at each of
the forty-six local exchanges mentioned.
"The engineers of this Commission have made a detailed inventory and appraisal and this Commission has
formally valued the Company's property at only three of
its exchanges, viz: at the City of Caruthersville, reported
in re Southwestern Tel. & Tel. Company, 2 Mo. P. S. C.
492; at the City of St. Louis in cases No. 234 and No. 235
as yet unreported; and at the City of Springfield, reported

in re Missouri and Kansas Telephone Company, 6 Mo.
P. S. C. 279, and as a result we have only the estimates
and appraisals of the Company before us in relation to
the value of the property at the other exchanges. We
think it is clear, however, from the data at hand that the
values placed by the Company upon the property are
excessive and not a just basis for rate making.
"The values fixed by this Commission at Caruthersville, St. Louis and Springfield in the cases above mentioned aggregate $11,003,898, while the Company estimates the aggregate cost of reproduction new of these
plants in this case at $18,971,011. The ratio of the
latter figure is 172.4 per cent. This percentage divided
into $35,100,471, the Company's estimate of the aggregate cost of reproduction new of its property in Missouri
in this case, equals $20,350,000, which might be said to be
one measure of the value of the property.
"Again, the Company's estimate of the aggregate cost
of reproduction new, less depreciation, of its properties
at Caruthersville, St. Louis and Springfield, in this case
is $16,913,673. The ratio of this figure to the aggregate
value fixed by the Commission at these exchanges, plus
additions reported by the Company, is 153.7 per cent.
This percentage divided into $31,355,278, the Company's
estimate of the aggregate cost of reproduction new, less
depreciation, of its property in Missouri in this case,
equals $20,400,000, which may be said to be another
measure of the value of the property.
"The Company also shows by Exhibits 19 and 212
that its return under the Postmaster General's rates on
$22,888,943, the book value of its property in the State,
is at the rate of 11.65 per cent per annum for depreciation and return on the investment, which would yield
the Company 6 per cent for depreciation and 5.65 per
cent for return on the book cost of the property. As
stated, however, we do not think that the book cost or the

S. W. TEL. CO. v. PUB. SERV. COMM.
276

Opinion of the Court.

'prorated book cost' of the property as claimed by the
Company would be a fair basis for rate making.
"As we understand it, the 'prorated book cost' given
in evidence by the Company for the various exchanges
is simply the percentage relation of reproduction cost
new which the original cost of all property bears to
reproduction cost new of all property and in individual
instances the actual cost might vary greatly, either up
or down, from what an appraisal would show. If the
Company, to eliminate competition, paid a price in excess of the value or because of discouraged local operation were enabled to purchase a plant far below its actual
value, the 'prorated book cost' basis would not reflect
anything like the original cost.
"We also think that the figure of $22,888,943, claimed
by the Company to represent the book cost or original
cost of its property in the State, is subject to certain
adjustments with reference to the amount of non-useful
property included, working capital, and the amount to
be deducted account extinguished value recouped from
patrons by charges to depreciation.
"In the St. Louis case, supra, the original cost of the
non-useful property deducted and disallowed by the
Commission amounted to $454,689.16. It appears from
the Company's Exhibit 256 that the 'prorated book cost'
of the St. Louis exchange is just about half of that given
for the State. However, it is clear that the proportion
of non-used and non-useful property in St. Louis bears
a much larger percentage relation to useful property
than would obtain throughout the State. It would appear that estimating the Company's property not used
and useful for the entire State at $500,000 would be
a fair' approximation. This sum at least should be
deducted. . .
"The depreciation reserve applicable to the Missouri
property is not shown by the Company. However, on

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.

262 U. S.

the Company's Exhibit 15, the balance sheet as of June
30, 1919, of the Southwestern Bell Telephone Company
(Missouri corporation) operating in Missouri, Kansas
and Arkansas, the reserve for accrued depreciation and
reserve for amortization of intangibles is given as
$7,963,082.37. The same exhibit shows the original cost
of fixed capital for Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas property as $46,061,162.76. The total fixed capital of the
Missouri property shown on the Company's Exhibit 19
is $21,837,759, which is 47.4 per cent of $46,061,162.76
and 47.4 per cent of the reserve for depreciation,
$7,963,082.37 equals $3,774,501, or the portion assignable
to the Missouri property.
"Adjusting in accordance with the above, we have:
Total plant and equipment, including working capital, as
per Company's Exhibit No. 19, $22,888,943. Deduct
property not used or useful, $500,000.00; deduct excess
working capital, $17,513.52; deduct depreciation reserve, $3,774,501.00; [total to be deducted] $4,292,014.52.
[Net total] $18,596,928.48; add for intangibles, 10 per
cent, $1,859,692.85; total adjusted original cost, $20,456,621.33.
"After carefully considering all the evidence as to
values before us in this case, we are of the opinion that
the value of the Company's property in the State, exclusive of Kansas City and Independence, devoted to
exchange service, will not exceed the sum of $20,400,000,
and we will tentatively adopt this sum as the value of
the property for the purposes of this case. As stated
supra, this Commission has formally valued only a part
of this property, and we should not be understood as
authoritatively fixing the value of the property at this
time."
The three earlier valuations to which the Commission
referred are-St. Louis, December 1913, $8,500,000;
Caruthersville, February 1914, $25,000; Springfield, Sep-

Opinion of the Court.

tember 1916, $815,000; total, $9,340,000. Between those
dates and June 30, 1919, additions were made to these
properties which cost, respectively, $1,623,765, $5,992 and
$34,141. Adding these to the original valuations gives
$11,003,898, the base sum used by the Commission for
the estimates now under consideration.
Obviously, the Commission undertook to value the
property without according any weight to the greatly enhanced costs of material, labor, supplies, etc., over those
prevailing in 1913, 1914 and 1916. As matter of common knowledge, these increases were large. Competent
witnesses estimated them as 45 to 50 per centum.
In Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U. S. 19, 41,
52, this Court said:
"There must be a fair return upon the reasonable value
of the property at the time it is being used for the public.

.

. . And we concur with the court below in

holding that the value of the property is to be determined as of the time when the inquiry is made regarding
the rates. If the property, which legally enters into the
consideration of the question of rates, has increased in
value since it was acquired, the company is entitled to
the benefit of such increase."
In the Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 454, this
was said:
"The making of a just return for the use of the property involves the recognition of its fair value if it be
more than its cost. The property is held in private ownership and it is that property, and not the original cost of
it, of which the owner may not be deprived without due
process of law."
See also Denver v. Denver Union Water Co., 246 U. S.
178, 191; Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., 258 U. S.
165 (March 6, 1922); and Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388 (April 10, 1922).
It is impossible to ascertain what will amount to a
fair return upon properties devoted to public service with-

out giving consideration to the cost of labor, supplies.
etc., at the time the investigation is made. An honest
and intelligent forecast of probable future values made
upon a view of all the relevant circumstances, is essential. If the highly important element of present costs
is wholly disregarded such a forecast becomes impossible.
Estimates for to-morrow cannot ignore prices of to-day.
Witnesses for the Company asserted-and there was no
substantial evidence to the contrary-that excluding cost
of establishing the business the property was worth at
least 25% more than the Commission's estimates, and we
think the proof shows that for the purposes of the present case the valuation should be at least $25,000,000.
After disallowing an actual expenditure of $174,04S.60
for rentals and services by the American Telephone &
Telegraph Company and some other items not presently
important, the Commission estimated the annual net
profits on operations available for depreciation and return as $2,828,617.60-approximately 1ll% of $25,000,000. That 6% should be allowed for depreciation appears
to be accepted by the Commission. Deducting this would
leave a possible 5i% return upon the minimum value of
the property, which is wholly inadequate considering the
character of the investment and interest rates then prevailing.
The important item of expense disallowed by the Coinmission-$174,048.60---is 55% of the 41% of gross revenues paid by plaintiff in error to the American Telephone
& Telegraph Company as rents for receivers, transmitters,
induction coils, etc., and for licenses and services under
the customary form of contract between the latter Company and its subsidiaries. Four and one-half per cent.
is the ordinary charge paid voluntarily by local companies
of the general system. There is nothing to indicate bad
faith. So far as appears, plaintiff in error's board of directors has exercised a proper discretion about this matter

requiring business judgment. It must never be forgotten
that while the State may regulate with a view to enforcing reasonable rates and charges, it is not the owner of the
property of public utility companies and is not clothed
with the general power of management incident to ownership. The applicable general rule is well expressed in
State Public Utilities Commission ex rel. Springfield v.
Springfield Gas and Electric Company, 291 Ill. 209, 234.
"The commission is not the financial manager of the
corporation and it is not empowered to substitute its
judgment for that of the directors of the corporation; nor
can it ignore items charged by the utility as operating
expenses unless there is an abuse of discretion in that regard by the corporate officers."
See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago Great
Western Ry. Co., 209 U. S.108; Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul R. R. Co. v. Wisconsin, 238 U. S.491; People ex
rel. v. Stevens, 197 N. Y. 1.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIs dissenting from opinion, with
whom MR. JUSTICE HOLMES concurs.
I concur in the judgment of reversal. But I do so on
the ground that the order of the state commission prevents the utility from earning a fair return on the amount
prudently ' invested in it. Thus, I differ fundamentally
from my brethren concerning the rule to be applied in determining whether a prescribed rate is confiscatory. The
Court, adhering to the so-called rule of Smyth v. Ames,
'The term prudent investment is not used in a critical sense.
There should not be excluded from the finding of the base, investments which, under ordinary circumstances, would be deemed reasonable. The term is applied for the purpose of excluding what might
be found to be dishonest or obviously wasteful or imprudent expenditures. Every investment may be assumed to have been made in the
exercise of reasonable judgment, unless the contrary is shown.

169 U. S. 466, and further defining it, declares that what
is termed value must be ascertained by giving weight,
among other things, to estimates of what it would cost to
reproduce the property at the time of the rate hearing.
The so-called rule of Smyth v. Ames is, in my opinion,
legally and economically unsound. The thing devoted by
the investor to the public use is not specific property,
tangible and intangible, but capital embarked in the enterprise. Upon the capital so invested the Federal Constitution guarantees to the utility the opportunity to earn
a fair return. Thus, it sets the limit to the power of the
State to regulate rates. The Constitution does not guarantee to the utility the opportunity to earn a return on
the value of all items of property used by the utility, or
of any of them. The several items of property constituting the utility, taken singly, and freed from the public use,
may conceivably have an aggregate value greater than if
the items are used in combination. The owner is at liberty, in the absence of controlling statutory provision, to
withdraw his property from the public service; and, if he
does so, may obtain for it exchange value. Compare
Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana,
251 U. S. 396; Erie R. R. Co. v. Public Utility Commissioners, 254 U. S. 394, 411; Texas v. Eastern Texas R. R.
Co., 258 U. S. 204. But so long as the specific items of
property are employed by the utility, their exchange value
is not of legal significance.
The investor agrees, by embarking capital in a utility, that its charges to the public shall be reasonable.
'Except that rates may, in no event, be prohibitive, exorbitant,
or unduly burdensome to the public.

His company is the substitute for the State in the performance of the public service; thus becoming a public servant. The compensation which the Constitution
guarantees an opportunity to earn is the reasonable cost
of conducting the business. Cost includes not only
operating expenses, but also capital charges. Capital
charges cover the allowance, by way of interest, for the
use of the capital, whatever the nature of the security
issued therefor; the allowance for risk incurred; and
enough more to attract capital. The reasonable rate
to be prescribed by a commission may allow an efficiently managed utility much more. But a rate is constitutionally compensatory, if it allows to the utility
the opportunity to earn the cost of the service as thus
defined.
To decide whether a proposed rate is confiscatory, the
tribunal must determine both what sum would be earned
under it, and whether that sum would be a fair return.
The decision involves ordinarily the making of four subsidiary ones:
1. What the gross earnings from operating the utility
under the rate in controversy would be. (A prediction.)
2. What the operating expenses and charges, while so
operating, would be. (A prediction.)
3. The rate-base, that is, what the amount is on which
.a return should be earned. (Under Smyth v. Ames, an
opinion, largely.)
4. What rate of return should be deemed fair. (An
opinion, largely.)
A decision that a rate is confiscatory (or compensatory)
is thus the resultant of four subsidiary determinations.
Each of the four involves forming a judgment, as distinguished from ascertaining facts. And as to each factor,
there is usually room for difference in judgment. But
the first two factors do not ordinarily present serious difficulties. The doubts and uncertainties incident to

prophecy, which affect them, can, often, be resolved by a
test period; and meanwhile protection may be afforded
by giving a bond. Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co.,
212 U. S. 1, 18, 19; St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern
Ry. Co. v. McKnight, 244 U. S. 368. The doubts and uncertainties incident to the last two factors can be eliminated, or lessened, only by redefining the rate base, called
value, and the measure of fairness in return, now applied
under the rule of Smyth v. Ames. The experience of the
twenty-five years since that case was decided has demonstrated that the rule there enunciated is delusive. In
the attempt to apply it insuperable obstacles have been
encountered. It has failed to afford adequate protection
either to capital or to the public. It leaves open the door
to grave injustice. To give to capital embarked in public
utilities the protection guaranteed by the Constitution,
and to secure for the public reasonable rates, it is essential that the rate base be definite, stable, and readily ascertainable; and that the percentage to be earned on the
rate base be measured by the cost, or charge, of the capital employed in the enterprise. It is consistent with the
Federal Constitution for this Court now to lay down a
rule which will establish such a rate base and such a
measure of the rate of return deemed fair. In my opinion,
it should do so.
The rule of Smyth v. Ames sets the laborious and baffling task of finding the present value of the utility. It
is impossible to find an exchange value for a utility, since
utilities, unlike merchandise or land, are not commonly
bought and sold in the market. Nor can the present
value of the utility be determined by capitalizing its net
earnings, since the earnings are determined, in large
measure, by the rate which the company will be permitted
to charge; and, thus, the vicious circle would be encountered. So, under the rule of Smyth v. Ames, it is usually
sought to prove the present value of a utility by ascer-

taining what it actually cost to construct and instal it;
or by estimating what it should have cost; or by estimating what it would cost to reproduce, or to replace, it.
To this end an enumeration is made of the component
elements of the utility, tangible, and intangible." Then
the actual, or the proper, cost of producing, or of reproducing, each part is sought. And finally, it is estimated
how much less than the new each part, or the whole, is
'In estimating replacement cost the first step is to determine what
part of the property owned is used and useful in the public service.
That involves, among other things, a consideration of retired or
discarded property and the question whether the size and capacity
of the plant are, in part, excessive.
The property included in the valuation is commonly treated under the following heads (See Report of Special Committee on Valuation, Amer. Society of Civil Engineers, October 28, 1916, Vol. 42
Proceedings, pp. 1708-1938):
A. Tangibles:
(a) Land and buildings.
(b) Plant.
B. Incidentals during construction:
(a) Administration.
(b) Engineering and superintendence.
(c) Legal expenses.

(g) Taxes.
(h) Bond discount.
(i) Contingencies.
C. Intangibles:
(a) Good will.
(b) Franchise value.
(c) Going concern value.
(d) Working capital.
"Going value" was declared by the Special Report (p. 1727) to
embrace, among other things, "efficiency, favorable business arrangements and design "; intangibles to include also "leases, easements, water rights, traffic and operating agreements, strategic location and advantages and other privileges."

ously each step in the process of estimating the cost of
reproduction, or replacement, involves forming an
opinion, or exercising judgment, as distinguished from
merely ascertaining facts. And this is true, also, of each
step in the process of estimating how much less the existing plant is worth, than if it were new. There is another
potent reason why, under the rule of Smyth v. Ames, the
room for difference in opinion as to the present value of a
utility is so wide. The rule does not measure the present
value either by what the utility cost to produce; or by
what it should have cost; or by what it would cost to reproduce, or to replace, it.' Under that rule the tribunal
is directed, in forming its judgment, to take into consideration all those and also, other elements, called relevant
facts.6
'Several different methods are used for measuring depreciation:
(1) The replacement method; (2) the straight-line method; (3) the
compound interest method; (4) the sinking fund method; (5) the
unit cost method. It is largely a matter of judgment whether, and
to what extent, any one of these several methods of measuring
depreciation should be applied. They may give widely different
results. Special Report, October 28, 1916, Valuation of Public
Utilities, Amer. Society of Civil Engineers, Vol. 42 Proceedings,
pp. 1723-1727; 1846-1900.

'This Court declared in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 547, that
"present as compared with original cost of construction" is to be
considered; and in Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 452, that
"the cost-of-reproduction method is of service in ascertaining the
present value of the plant, when it is reasonably applied and when
the cost of reproducing the property may be ascertained with a
proper degree of certainty." Reproduction cost was thus held to be
evidence of value. But it has never been held to be the measure of
value.
'Some of these so-called relevant facts are, as the rule has been
applied:

(a) Capitalization, i. e., bonds, stock, and other securities outstanding.
(b) Book cost, i. e., the investment account as shown on the books.

Obviously "value" cannot be a composite of all these
elements. Nor can it be arrived at on all these bases.
They are very different; and must, when applied in a
particular case, lead to widely different results. The rule
of Smyth v. Ames, as interpreted and applied, means
merely that all must be considered. What, if any, weight
shall be given to any one, must practically rest in the
judicial discretion of the tribunal which makes the deter(c) Actual cost, i. e., amounts actually paid in cash for installing
the original plant and business, and the additions thereto.
(d) Historical cost, i. e., the proper cost of the existing plant and
business, estimated on the basis of the price levels existing at the
respective dates when the plant and the additions were constructed.
This is often called prudent investment. Historical cost would, under
normal conditions, be equal in amount to the original cost. The
phrases are sometimes used to denote the same thing. But they are
not the same; and they are often ascertained by different processes.
Original cost is the amount actually paid to establish the utility.
The amount is ascertained, where possible, by inspection of books
and vouchers, and by other direct evidence. If this class of evidence
is not colnplete, it may be necessary to supplement it by evidence as
to what was probably paid for some items, by showing pices prevailing for work and materials at the time the same were supplied.
But the evidence of these prices is merely circumstantial, or corroborative, evidence of the amount actually paid. In determining
actual cost, whatever the evidence, there is no attempt to determine
whether the expenditure was wise or foolish, or whether it was useful
or wasteful. Historical cost, on the other hand, is the amount which
normally should have been paid for all the property which is usefully
devoted to the public service. It is, in effect, what is termed the
prudent investment. In enterprises efficiently launched and developed, historical cost and original cost would practically coincide both
in items included and in amounts paid. That is, the subjects of
expenditure would coincide; and the cost at prices prevailing at the
time of installation would substantially coincide with the actual cost.
(e) Reproduction cost of plant and business--estimated on price
levels prevailing at the date of valuation.
(f) Reproduction cost of plant and business, estimated on average
price levels prevailing during periods of, say, 5 to 10 years preceding
the valuation.

mination. Whether a desired result is reached may depend upon how any one of many elements is treated.
It is true that the decision is usually rested largely upon
records of financial transactions, on statistics and calculations. But as stated in Louisville v. Cumberland Telegraph & Telephone Co., 225 U. S. 430, 436, "every figure
that we have set down with delusive exactness"
is "speculative."
The efforts of courts to control commissions' findings of
value have largely failed. The reason lies in the character of the rule declared in Smyth v. Ames. The rule
there stated was to be applied solely as a means of determining whether rates already prescribed by the legislature
were confiscatory. It was to be applied judicially after
the rate had been made; and by a court which had had
no part in making the rate. When applied under such
circumstances the rule, although cumbersome, may occasionally be effective in destroying an obstruction to justice, as the action of a court is, when it sets aside the
verdict of a jury. But the commissions undertook to
make the rule their standard for constructive action.
They used it as a guide for making, or approving, rates.
And the tendency developed to fix as reasonable, the rate
which is not so low as to be confiscatory." Thus the rule
which assumes that rates of utilities will ordinarily be
higher than the minimum required by the Constitution
has, by the practice of the commissions, eliminated the
margin between a reasonable rate and a merely compensatory rate; and, in the process of rate making, effective
judicial review is very often rendered impossible

Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388, 401, 402. The range for
difference of opinion on each of the many factors to be taken into
consideration in fixing the rate base is so wide that such compelling
evidence can rarely be adduced, where the report filed recites that,
after full hearing, all the so-called relevant facts were given consideration by the commission in reaching the decision made. There may
often be found in opinions of utility commissions, after a lengthy
and detailed discussion of a vast quantity of expert opinion, a conclusion like the following from Re Illinois Northern Utilities Co.,
P. U. R. 1920 D, 979, 999:
"After considering all the evidence and arguments of counsel in
this case, bearing upon the valuation of the properties herein involved, the investment therein, their original costs, cost to reproduce,
and present values, including all overheads; preliminary costs; costs
of engineering; supervision, interest, insurance, organization and legal
expenses during construction; working capital; materials and supplies;
and all other elements of value, tangible and intangible, and considering the plants are now going concerns in successful operation, the Commission finds . . for the purposes of this proceeding, and for those
purposes only, the fair rate-making values . . as follows."
Hence, a commission's order must ordinarily be allowed to stand,
unless it appears that there was some irregularity in the proceedings
or that some erroneous rule of law was applied.
Since Smyth v. Ames this Court has dealt with the validity (under
the Fourteenth Amendment) of rate regulation by the States in over
50 cases. In only 25 of these has the Court passed upon the question
whether a rate fixed, or approved, by a state commission denied to
the utility the opportunity of earning a fair return upon the fair
value of the property. In none of these 25 cases has an order of a
state commission, made after a full hearing, been declared void by
this Court, on the ground that the finding of the rate-base, or value,
was too low. In none of them has the order been declared void on
the ground that the commission fixed too low a percentage of return.
Lower federal courts and state courts have occasionally intervened
with effect. But the instances are relatively few as compared with
the number of adverse decisions of the commissions. Even where
orders fixing rates have been set aside for irregularity or error, the
result of the new hearing is not, always advantageous to the company.

only fails to furnish any applicable standard of judgment,
but directs consideration of so many elements, that almost
any result may be justified.
The adoption of present value of the utility's property,
as the rate base, was urged in 1893, on behalf of the
community; and it was adopted by the courts, largely,
as a protection against inflated claims based on what
were then deemed inflated prices of the past. See argument in Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, 479, 480; San
Diego Land & Town Co. v. National City, 174 U. S. 739,
757, 758; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, 189
U. S. 439, 442, 443; Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin &
Kings River Canal & Irrigation Co., 192 U. S. 201, 214.
Reproduction cost, as the measure, or as evidence, of
present value was, also, pressed then by representatives
of the public who sought to justify legislative reductions
of railroad rates." The long depression which followed
the panic of 1893 had brought prices to the lowest level
reached in the Nineteenth Century. Insistence upon reproduction cost was the shippers' protest against burdens
believed to have resulted from watered stocks, reckless
financing, and unconscionable construction contracts.
Those were the days before state legislation prohibited
the issue of public utility securities without authorization from state officials; before accounting was prescribed
and supervised; when outstanding bonds and stocks were
hardly an indication of the amount of capital embarked
in the enterprise; when depreciation accounts were unknown; and when book values, or property accounts,
furnished no trustworthy evidence either of cost or of
real value. Estimates of reproduction cost were then
offered, largely as a means, either of supplying lacks in
the proof of actual cost and investment, or of testing

the credibility of evidence adduced, or of showing that
the cost of installation had been wasteful. For these
purposes evidence of the cost of reproduction is obviously
appropriate.
At first reproduction cost was welcomed by commissions as evidence of present value. Perhaps it was because the estimates then indicated values lower than
the actual cost of installation. For, even after the price
level had begun to rise, improved machinery and new
devices tended for some years to reduce construction
costs. 10 Evidence of reproduction costs was certainly
welcomed, because it seemed to offer a reliable means
for performing the difficult task of fixing, in obedience to
Smyth v. Ames, the value of a new species of property
to which the old tests--selling price or net earningswere not applicable. The engineer spoke in figures--a
language implying certitude. His estimates seemed to
be free of the infirmities which had stamped as untrustworthy the opinion evidence of experts common in condemnation cases. Thus, for some time, replacement cost,
on the basis of prices prevailing at the date of the valuation, was often adopted by state commissions as the
standard for fixing the rate base. But gradually it came
to be realized that the definiteness of the engineer's calculations was delusive; that they rested upon shifting
theories; and that their estimates varied so widely as to
intensify, rather than to allay doubts."' When the price

cost indicated values much greater than the actual cost
of installation, many commissions refused to consider
valuable what one declared to be assumptions based on
things that never happened and estimates requiring the
projection of the engineer's imagination into the future

never been and never will be adopted by sane men."

the World War led to the transfusion of the engineer's
estimate of cost with the economist's prophecies concerning the future price plateaus. Then, the view that these

wise or foolish; the investment improvident or frugal. It is based
upon prophecy instead of reality, and depends so much upon half
truths that it bears only a remote resemblance to fact, and rises at

Smyth v. Ames, failed, in ever-increasing numbers, to
pay heed to it in fixing the rate base." The conviction
is wide-spread that a sound conclusion as to the actual
value of a utility is not to be reached by a meticulous
study of conflicting estimates of the cost of reproducing

the plant, and the still more fanciful estimates concerning the value of the intangible elements of an established

valuation appears to have been the predominant element in fixing
the rate base in only 5. In 63 the commission severely criticised,

address delivered at the "Conference on Valuation" in Philadelphia,
November, 1915, in which the late John M. Eshleman, first president
of the California Railroad Commission, said: "If we had this problem at the beginning and were not attacking it in the middle, we
would have no difficulty in agreeing with the holder of capital upon
this subject, for he would quite readily agree to take the cost of
doing the business plus an earning upon the money actually invested
comparable to the earning offered in other available investments.
Therefore, the cost of doing the business, plus a return upon the
capital necessarily invested in the business, which return shall be as
great as is offered in other businesses of similar hazard, is all that
ought to be accorded for the future, and it is all that will be accorded
if the public has any business sense. And if more is asked by the

downward.'" The aggregate of the investments which have

already been made at high costs since 1914, and of those
which will be made before prices and costs can fall heavily,
may soon exceed by far the depreciated value of all the
public utility investments made theretofore at relatively
low cost.

For it must be borne in mind that depreciation

is an annual charge.

That accrued on plants constructed

in the long years prior to 1914 is much larger than that
private owner, then he may expect no sympathy when he finds the
public his competitor and his earning power impaired."

" Engineers testifying in recent rate cases have assumed that there
will be a new plateau of prices. In Galveston Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388, the company contended that a plateau 70 per cent.
above the price level of 1914 should be accepted, and a plateau 331
per cent. above was found probable by the master and assumed to
be such b the lower court. In Bluefield Water Works & Improvement Co. v. Public Service Commission, 679, post, one 50
per cent. above the 1914 level was contended for; in the case
at bar a plateau 25 per cent. above. But for the assumption
that there will be a plateau there is no basis in American experience.
The course of prices for the last 112 years indicates, on the contrary,
that there may be a practically continuous decline for nearly a generation; that the present price level may fall to that of 1914 within a
decade; and that, later, it may fall much lower. Prices rose steadily
(with but slight and short recessions) for the 20 years before the
United States entered the World War. From the low level of 1897
they rose 21 per cent. to 1900; then rose further (with minor fluctuations, representing times of good business or bad) and reached in
1914 a point 50 per cent. above the 1897 level. Then the great rise
incident to the war set in. "Wholesale Prices, 1890 to 1921," U. S.

accruing on the properties installed in the shorter period

That part of the rule of Smyth v. Ames which fixes the
rate of return deemed fair, at the percentage customarily
paid on similar investments at the time of the rate hearing, also exposes the investor and the public to danger
of serious injustice.

If the replacement-cost measure of

value and the prevailing-rate measure of fairness of return should be applied, a company which raised, in 1920,
line (100). As compared with them the 1897 level was 67, the 1900
level 81. The chart on page 10 of the pamphlet entitled, " Price
Changes and Business Prospects," published by the Cleveland Trust
Company, gives price fluctuations for the 110 years prior to 1921.
It shows three abrupt rises in the price level, by reason of war; and
some less abrupt falls, by reason of financial panic. These may be
called abnormal. But the normal has never been a plateau. The
chart shows that the peak price levels were practically the same
during the War of 1812, the Civil War, and the World War; and it
shows that practically continuous declines, for about 30 years, followed the first two wars. The experience after the third may be
similar.
' The new enterprises undertaken at the present high level, or
projected, are many; among them, development and long distance
transmission of hydroelectric power, and of electric power generated
at the coal mines. Moreover, nearly every utility now existing must
make expenditures upon its plant to provide improvements, additions,
or extensions. The growth of our communities, and increase in the
demands of the individual, constantly compel enlargement of a utility's facilities. The present annual investment in public utility enterprises is much greater in amount than at any time in the past. Some
of the construction done during the war was at prices for labor and
materials 120 per cent. above those prevailing in 1914. Recent construction was at prices 70 per cent. higher. If replacement cost
should become the measure of the rate base, the return on enterprises
entered upon after 1914 would, obviously, be imperilled. And a
serious decline of the price level would subject the return on many
utilities established earlier to like dangers. A collapse of public
utility values might result. And the impairment of public utility
credit might be followed by the cessation of extensions and new
undertakings.

for additions to plant, $1,000,000 on a 9 per cent. basis, by
a stock issue, or by long-term bond issue, may find a decade later, that the value of the plant (disregarding depreciation) is only $600,000, and that the fair return on
money then invested in such enterprise is only 6 per cent.
Under the test of a compensatory rate, urged in reliance
upon Smyth v. Ames, a prescribed rate would not be confiscatory, if it appeared that the utility could earn under
it $36,000 a year; whereas $90,000 would be required to
earn the capital charges. On the other hand, if a
plant had been built in times of low costs, at $1,000,000
and the capital had been raised to the extent of
$750,000 by an issue at par of 5 per cent. 30-year
bonds and to the extent of $250,000 by stock at par, and
ten years later the price level was 75 per cent. higher and
the interest rates 8 per cent., it would be a fantastic result
to hold that a rate was confiscatory, unless it yielded 8
per cent. on the then reproduction cost of $1,750,000.
For that would yield an income of $140,000, which would
give the bondholders $37,500; and to the holders of the
$250,000 stock $102,500, a return of 41 per cent. per
annum. Money required to establish in 1920 many necessary plants has cost the utility 10 per cent. on thirtyyear bonds. These long-time securities, issued to raise
needed capital, will in 1930 and thereafter continue to
bear the extra high rates of interest, which it was necessary to offer in 1920 in order to secure the required capital. The prevailing rate for such investments may in
1930 be only 7 per cent.; or indeed 6 per cent.; as it was
found to be in 1904, in Stanislaus County v. San Joaquin
& Kings River Canal & Irrigation Co., 192 U. S. 201; in
1909, in Knoxville v. Knoxville Water Co., 212 U. S. 1;
and in 1912, in Cedar Rapids Gas Light Co. v. Cedar
Rapids, 223 U. S. 655, 670. A rule'which limits the guaranteed rate of return on utility investments to that which

may prevail at the time of the rate hearing, may fall far
short of the capital charge then resting upon the company.
In essence, there is no difference between the capital
charge and operating expenses, depreciation, and taxes.
Each is a part of the current cost of supplying the service;
and each should be met from current income. When the
capital charges are for interest on the floating debt paid
at the current rate, this is readily seen. But it is no less
true of a legal obligation to pay interest on long-term
bonds, entered into years before the rate hearing and to
continue for years thereafter; and it is true also of the
economic obligation to pay dividends on stock, preferred
or common. The necessary cost, and hence the capital
charge, of the money embarked recently in utilities, and
of that which may be invested in the near future, may be
more, as it may be less, than the prevailing rate of return
required to induce capital to enter upon like enterprises
at the time of a rate hearing ten years hence. To fix the
return by the rate which happens to prevail at such future
day, opens the door to great hardships. Where the
financing has been proper, the cost to the utility of the
capital, required to construct, equip and operate its plant,
should measure the rate of return which the Constitution
guarantees opportunity to earn.18
The adoption of the amount prudently invested as the
rate base and the amount of the capital charge as the
measure of the rate of return would give definiteness to
these two factors involved in rate controversies which are
now shifting and treacherous, and which render the proceedings peculiarly burdensome and largely futile. Such
measures offer a basis for decision which is certain and
stable. The rate base would be ascertained as a fact, not
determined as matter of opinion. It would not fluctuate
" The community may, of course, demand, in respect to financing,
as in respect to operation, that the right to earn a fair return be
limited by the requirement that reasonable efficiency be exercised.

with the market price of labor, or materials, or money.
It would not change with hard times or shifting populations. It would not be distorted by the fickle and varying judgments of appraisers, commissions, or courts. It
would, when once made in respect to any utility, be fixed,
for all time, subject only to increases to represent additions to plant, after allowance for the depreciation included in the annual operating charges. The wild uncertainties of the present method of fixing the rate base
under the so-called rule of Smyth v. Ames would be
avoided; and likewise the fluctuations which introduce
into the enterprise unnecessary elements of speculation,
create useless expense, and impose upon the public a
heavy, unnecessary burden.
In speculative enterprises the capital cost of money is
always high; partly because the risks involved must be
covered; partly because speculative enterprises appeal
only to the relatively small number of investors who are
unwilling to accept a low return on their capital. It is
to the interest both of the utility and of the community
that the capital be obtained at as low a cost as possible.
About 75 per cent. of the capital invested in utilities is
represented by bonds. He who buys bonds seeks primarily safety. If he can obtain it, he is content with a
low rate of interest. Through a fluctuating rate base the
bondholder can only lose. He can receive no benefit
from a rule which increases the rate base as the price
level rises; for his return, expressed in dollars, would be
the same, whatever the income of the company."' That
'Of course, anyone who chances to have money to invest, when
money rates are high, gets the advantage incident to investing in
a favorable market. If he invests in utility bonds, the higher agreed
return upon his capital would be provided for by a rule which measures fair return by capital charges, as suggested above. If he elects
to invest in the stock, he would, under the rule suggested, have the
opportunity of earning a return commensurate with the value of the
capital at the time it was embarked as stock in the enterprise,

the stockholder does not in fact receive an increased return in time of rapidly rising prices under the rule of
Smyth v. Ames, as applied, the financial record of the
last six years demonstrates. But the burden upon the
community is heavy because the risk makes the capital
cost high.
The expense and loss now incident to recurrent rate
controversies is also very large. The most serious vice
of the present rule for fixing the rate base is not the
existing uncertainty; but that the method does not lead
to certainty. Under it, the value for rate-making purposes must ever be an unstable factor. Instability is a
standing menace of renewed controversy. The direct expense to the utility of maintaining an army of experts
and of counsel is appalling. The indirect cost is far
greater. The attention of officials high and low is, necessarily, diverted from the constructive tasks of efficient
operation and of development. The public relations of
the utility to the community are apt to become more
and more strained. And a victory for the utility, may
in the end, prove more disastrous than defeat would have
been. The community defeated, but unconvinced, remembers; and may refuse aid when the company has
occasion later to require its consent or co~peration in
the conduct and development of its enterprise. Controversy with utilities is obviously injurious also to the
public interest. The prime needs of the community are
that facilities be ample and that rates be as low and as
stable as possible. The community can get cheap service from private companies, only through cheap capital.
It can get efficient service, only if managers of the utility
are free to devote themselves to problems of operation
and of development. It can get ample service through
private companies, only if investors may be assured of
receiving continuously a fair return upon the investment.
What is now termed the prudent investment is, in essence, the same thing as that which the Court has always

sought to protect in using the term present value.2
Twenty-five years ago, when Smyth v. Ames was decided,
it was impossible to ascertain with accuracy, in respect to
most of the utilities, in most of the States in which rate
controversies arose, what it cost in money to establish
the utility; or what the money cost with which the utility
was established; or what income had been earned by it;
or how the income had been expended. It was, therefore, not feasible, then, to adopt, as the rate base, the
amount properly invested or, as the rate of fair return,
the amount of the capital charge. Now the situation
is fundamentally different. These amounts are, now,
readily ascertainable in respect to a large, and rapidly
increasing, proportion of the utilities. The change in
this respect is due to the enlargement, meanwhile, of the
powers and functions of state utility commissions. The
issue of securities is now, and for many years has been,
under the control of commissions, in the leading States.
Hence the amount of capital raised (since the conferring
of these powers) and its cost are definitely known,
through current supervision and prescribed accounts,
supplemented by inspection of the commission's engineering force. Like knowledge concerning the investment of that part of the capital raised and expended
before these broad functions were exercised by the utility
commissions has been secured, in many cases, through
investigations undertaken later, in connection with the
issue of new securities or the regulation of rates. The
amount and disposition of current earnings of all the

first given expression. See also "Public Utilities, Their Cost New

companies are also known. It is, therefore, feasible now
to adopt as the measure of a compensatory rate-the
annual cost, or charge, of the capital prudently invested
in the utility."1 And, hence, it should be done.
Value is a word of many meanings. That with which
commissions and courts in these proceedings are concerned, in so-called confiscation cases, is a special value
for rate-making purposes, not exchange value. This is
illustrated by our decisions which deal with the elements
to be included in fixing the rate base. In Cedar Rapids
Gas Light Co. v. Cedar Rapids, 223 U. S. 655, 669; and
Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153, 165,
good will and franchise value were excluded from the
rate base in determining whether the prescribed charges
' In 1898, when Smyth v. Ames was decided, only one StateMassachusetts--had control by commission of the issue of securities
by all public utility companies. (New Hampshire controlled security
issues of railroads and street railways; Maine and New York controlled
increase of capital stock by railroads; and Connecticut, the issue of
bonds by railroads.) In 1923 at least 24 States and the District of
Columbia controlled through commissions the issue of securities of
public utility companies. Legislation for 1923 and 1922 (in part)
has not been available. Other States may have legislated on the
subject in 1923 or 1922.
In 1898 no State had control by commission of the accounting of
all public utilities. Massachusetts controlled the accounting of gas,
electric light, street railway, and railroad companies; Iowa, of railways and carriers; New York, Texas and Vermont, of railroads only.
In 1923 at least 36 States and the District of Columbia controlled
through commissions the accounting of public utility companies.
In 1898, only one State-Massachusetts--exercised through a commission control of all public utilities. In 1923 such control is exercised in at least 39 States and the District of Columbia. This does
not include thoge States exercising commission control over railroads
and related utilities, such as street railways, express companies,- telephone and telegraph companies. These States number 47. The
number of States having commission control of railroads in 1898 was
27. In 1922 every State except Delaware had commission control of
railroads.

of the public utility were confiscatory. In Galveston
Electric Co. v. Galveston, 258 U. S. 388, the cost of developing the business as a financially successful concern
was excluded from the rate base. In Des Moines Gas
Co. v. Des Moines, 238 U. S. 153, 171, the fact that the
street had been paved (and hence the reproduction cost
of laying gas mains greatly increased), was not allowed
as an element of value. But, obviously, good will and
franchise value are important elements when exchange
value is involved. And where the community acquires
a public utility by purchase or condemnation, compensation must be made for its good will and earning power;
at least under some circumstances. Omaha v. Omaha
Water Co., 218 U. S. 180, 202, 203; National Waterworks
Co. v. Kansas City, 62 Fed. 853, 865. Likewise, as between buyer and seller, the good will and earning power
due to effective organization are often more important
elements than tangible property. These cases would
seem to require rejection of a rule which measured the
rate base by cost of reproduction or by value in its ordinary sense.
The rule by which the utilities are seeking to measure
the return is, in esseice, reproduction cost of the utility
or prudent investment, whichever is the higher. This is
indicated by the instructions contained in the Special
Report on Valuation of Public Utilities, made to the
American Society of Civil Engineers, October 28, 1916,
Proceedings, Vol. 42:
"So long as the company owner keeps a sum equivalent to the total investment at work for the public, either
as property serving the public, or funds held in reserve
for such property, no policy should be followed in estimating depreciation that will reduce the property to a
value less than the investment. . . . "(p. 1726).
"Estimates of the cost of reproduction should be based
on the assumption that the identical property is to be

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.

262 U. S.

reproduced, rather than a substitute property" (p. 1719),
-"
although such a substitute property, much less costly
than the existing plant, might furnish equal or- better
service, it is not reproduction of service, but of property,
that is under consideration; and clearly the estimate
should be of existing property created with public approval, rather than of a substituted property" (p. 1772).
If the aim were to ascertain the value (in its ordinary
sense) of the utility property, the enquiry would be, not
what it would cost to reproduce the identical property,
but what it would cost to establish a plant which could
render the service, or in other words, at what cost could
an equally efficient substitute be then produced. Surely
the cost of an equally efficient substitute must be the
maximum of the rate base, if prudent investment be
rejected as the measure. The utilities seem to claim that
the constitutional protection against confiscation guarantees them a return both upon unearned increment and
upon the cost of property rendered valueless by obsolescence.
