PECK v. TRIBUNE CO.
214 U. S.

Argument for Petitioner.

PECK, PETITIONER, v. TRIBUNE COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 191.

Argued April 29, 30, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.

The publication of a portrait with a statement thereunder imports
that the original of the portrait makes the statement even if another
name be attached to the statement. Wandt v. Hearst's Chicago
American, 129 Wisconsin, 419; Morrison v. Smith, 177 N. Y. 366, approved on this point.
Publication of the portrait of one person with statements thereunder
as of another, by mistake, and without knowledge of whom the portrait really is, is not an excuse. A libel is harmful on its face, and
one publishing manifestly hurtful statements concerning an individual does so at his peril; and, if there is no justification other than
that it was news or advertising, he is liable if the statements are
false or are true only of some one else. See Morasse v. Brochu,
151 Massachusetts, 567.
An unprivileged falsehood need not entail universal hatred to constitute a cause of action; to be libellous a statement need not be that
the person libelled has done or said something that every one, or
even a majority of persons in the community, may regard as discreditable; it is sufficient if the statement hurts the party alluded to
in the estimation of an important and respectable part of the community.
A woman, whose portrait is published in connection with an endorsement of a brand of whiskey may be seriously hurt in her standing
with a considerable portion of her neighbors and she is entitled to
prove her case and go to the jury.
Queure and not decided whether the unauthorized publication of a person's likeness is a tort per se.
154 Fed. Rep. 330, reversed.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. S. C. Irving, with whom Mr. Rufus S. Simmons and
Mr. Frank J. R. Mitchell were on the brief, for petitioner:
The article declared upon was libellous and actionable per se.

publication establishes the cause of action. Kraus v. Sentinel

Even though the libel does not name the person injured it
is sufficient if it can be shown that it refers to him.
Evidence of falsity of defamatory matter may be offered
to enhance damages even though the falsity of the publication is admitted by the pleadings.

214 U. S.

Argument for Respondent.

Though plea of general issue admits falsity as to words of
publication, plaintiff may nevertheless prove that words are
false as to her when her name is not mentioned in the publication. Alliance Review v. Valentine, 9 C. C. Rep. (Ohio) 387;
S. C. 6 Ohio C. Dec. 323.
Though plaintiff's name was not mentioned, still the words
of the publication may clearly refer to the plaintiff. Pavesich
v. New Eng. Life Ins. Co., 122 Georgia, 190; Barron v. Smith,
19 So. Dak. 50, 54; Morrison v. Smith, 177 N. Y. 366; Palmer
v. Bennett, 31 N. Y. Supp. 567.
Mistake is no excuse for the publication of a libel as suggested by the opinion in the Court of Appeals. The alleged
mistake in this case was an unwarranted assumption of a
fact not proved.
Even if proved mistake is no excuse for publishing libel. Mr.
Justice Holmes in Hanson v. Globe Newspaper, 159 Massachusetts, 293, 299; The King v. Woodfall, Lofft's Rep. 776, 782,

MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action on the case for a libel. The libel alleged
is found in an advertisement printed in the defendant's newspaper, The Chicago Sunday Tribune, and so far as is material
is as follows: "Nurse and Patients Praise Duffy's-Mrs A.
Schuman, One of Chicago's Most Capable and Experienced
Nurses, Pays an Eloquent Tribute to the Great Invigorating,
Life-Giving and Curative Properties of Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey. . . ." Then followed a portrait of the plaintiff,
with the words "Mrs. A. Schuman" under it. Then, in
quotation marks, "After years of constant use of your Pure
Malt Whiskey, both by myself and as given to patients in
my capacity as nurse, I have no hesitation in recommending
it as the very best tonic and stimulant for all weak and rundown conditions," &c., &c., with the words "Mrs. A. Schuman,
1576 Mozart st., Chicago, Ill.," at the end, not in quotation
marks, but conveying the notion of a signature, or at least that
the words were hers. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was not Mrs. Schuman, was not a nurse, and was a total
abstainer from whiskey and all spirituous liquors. There was
also a count for publishing the plaintiff's likeness without
leave. The defendant pleaded not guilty. At the trial, subject to exceptions, the judge excluded the plaintiff's testimony in support of her allegations just stated, and directed a
verdict for the defendant. His action was sustained by the
Circuit Court of Appeals. 154 Fed. Rep. 330; S. C, 83 C. C. A.
202.
Of course the insertion of the plaintiff's picture in the place
and with the concomitants that we have described imported
that she was the nurse and made the statements set forth, as

PECK v. TRIBUNE CO.

Opinion of the Court.

rightly was decided in Wandt v. Hearst's Chicago American,
129 Wisconsin, 419, 421. Morrison v. Smith, 177 N. Y. 366.
Therefore the publication was of and concerning the plaintiff,
notwithstanding the presence of another fact, the name of the
real signer of the certificate, if that was Mrs. Schuman, that
was inconsistent, when all the facts were known, with the
plaintiff's having signed or adopted it. Many might recognize
the plaintiff's face without knowing her name, and those who
did know it might be led to infer that she had sanctioned the
publication under an alias. There was some suggestion that
the defendant published the portrait by mistake, and without knowledge that it was the plaintiff's portrait or was not
what it purported to be. But the fact, if it was one, was no
excuse. If the publication was libellous the defendant took
the risk. As was said of such matters by Lord Mansfield,
"Whatever a man publishes he publishes at his peril." The
King v. Woodfall, Lofft, 776, 781. See further Hearne v.
Stowell, 12 A. & E. 719, 726; Shepheard v. Whitaker, L. R.
10 C. P. 502; Clark v. North American Co., 203 Pa. St. 346, 351,
352. The reason is plain. A libel is harmful on its face. If a
man sees fit to publish manifestly hurtful statements concerning an individual, without other justification than exists for
an advertisement or a piece of news, the usual principles of
tort will make him liable, if the statements are false or are
true only of some one else. See Morasse v. Brochu, 151 Massachusetts, 567, 575.
The question, then, is whether the publication was a libel.
It was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals not to be, or at
most to entitle the plaintiff only to nominal damages, no
special damage being alleged. It was pointed out that there
was no general consensus of opinion that to drink whiskey is
wrong or that to be a nurse is discreditable. It might have
been added that very possibly giving a certificate and the use
of one's portrait in aid of an advertisement would be regarded
with irony, or a stronger feeling, only by a few. But it appears to us that such inquiries are beside the point. It may

OCTOBER TERM, 1908

214 U. S.

be that the action for libel is of little use, but while it is maintained it should be governed by the general principles of tort.
If the advertisement obviously would hurt the plaintiff in the
estimation of an important and respectable part of the community, liability is not a question of a majority vote.
We know of no decision in which this matter is discussed
upon principle. But obviously an unprivileged falsehood need
not entail universal hatred to constitute a cause of action.
No falsehood is thought about or even known by all the world.
No conduct is hated by all. That it will be known by a large
number and will lead an appreciable fraction of that number
to regard the plaintiff with contempt is enough to do her
practical harm. Thus if a doctor were represented as advertising, the fact that it would affect his standing with others
of his profession might make the representation actionable,
although advertising is not reputed dishonest and even seems
to be regarded by many with pride. See Martin v. The Picayune, 115 Louisiana, 979. It seems to us impossible to say that
the obvious tendency of what is imputed to the plaintiff by
this advertisement is not seriously to hurt her standing with
a considerable and respectable class in the community. Therefore it was the plaintiff's right to prove her case and go to
the jury, and the defendant would have got all that it could
ask if had been permitted to persuade them, if it could, to
take a contrary view. Culmer v. Canby, 101 Fed. Rep. 195,
197; Twombly v. Monroe, 136 Massachusetts, 464, 469. See
Gates v. New York Recorder Co., 155 N. Y. 228.
It is unnecessary to consider the question whether the publication of the plaintiff's likeness was a tort per se. It is enough
for the present case that the law should at least be prompt
to recognize the injuries that may arise from an unauthorized
use in connection with other facts, even if more subtilty is
needed to state the wrong than is needed here. In this instance we feel no doubt.
Judgment reversed.
