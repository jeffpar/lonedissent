OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

214 U. S.

INTERNATIONAL MERCANTILE MARINE COMPANY
v. STRANAHAN.
SAME v. SAME.
IN ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN

Nos. 510, 511.

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

Argued January 11, 12, 1909.-Decided June 1, 1909.

Decided on the authority of the preceding case.

THE facts are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William G. Choate and Mr. Lucius H. Beers for plaintiffs in error.1
Mr. Wade H. Ellis, Assistant to the Attorney General,
with whom Mr. Henry L. Stimson, Mr. Winfred T. Demson and
1
Mr E. P. Grosvenor were on the brief for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the court.

These writs of error are prosecuted to obtain the reversal of
judgments entered in favor of the United States in actions
brought to recover back sums paid as penalties imposed and
collected under authority of ยง 9 of the Immigration Act of
March 3, 1903. One action concerned penalties exacted before
and the other related to a penalty which attached after the
promulgation by the Secretary of Commerce and Labor of a
certain rule of procedure known as circular No. 58. As the
controversies in these cases are of the same nature as that presented by the record in Oceanic Steam Navigation Company,
Limited, v. The United States, No. 509, just decided, ante,
p. 320, and as the principles which controlled the decision in
that case are here absolutely decisive, the judgments in these
cases must be, and they are,
Affirmed.
