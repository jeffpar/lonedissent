Argument for Petitioner.

In re MARY HATCH RIGGS.
APPLICATION AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE GOODS, CHATTELS AND
CREDITS OF CLARENCE 13. RIGGS, DECEASED, IN BEHALF OF
HERSELF AND ALL OTHERS SIMILARLY SITUATED, FOR A WRIT
OF MANDAMUS AGAINST THE HONORABLES GEORGE C. HOLT
AND CHARLES M. HOUGH, JUDGES OF THE DISTRICT COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK, AND AGAINST THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
No. 11, Original.

Argued April 12, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.

Mandamus is not a proper substitute for a writ of error.
Where the bankruptcy court in adjudicating a corporation a bankrupt
is called upon to decide, and does decide, a question of fact, or of
mixed law and fact, that adjudication cannot be reviewed by pro-

ceedings in mandamus. Re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323; Re Winn, 213
U. S. 458.
Where the evidence sustaining an application for an adjudication in
bankruptcy is not disclosed this court will not assume that it was
not sufficient.
Mandamus to the bankruptcy court to dismiss proceedings in bankruptcy against a corporation because the petition failed to show
that the principal business of the bankrupt was trading, printing,
publishing, mining, manufacturing or a mercantile pursuit, refused.

THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Benjamin S. Catchings for petitioner:
The District Court is without jurisdiction over the Tunnel
Company. That company was not a corporation principally
engaged in trading, printing, publishing, mining, manufactur-

ing or a mercantile pursuit, and this was apparent upon the
face of the petition in bankruptcy.

Argument for Petitioner.

214 U. S.

The statute is strictly construed and jurisdiction thereunder
is derived from the statute only. New York v. New Jersey
Ice Lines, 147 Fed. Rep. 214.
The classes of corporations enumerated in § 46 as subject to
the act, are to be strictly construed and include only corporations clearly within the enumeration. Chicago Joplin Lead
& Zinc Co., 104 Fed. Rep. 67; Butt v. C. F. McNichol Const.
Co., 140 Fed. Rep. 840; Hughes on Fed. Pro., p. 86. Building companies and contracting companies are not within § 4b
of the statute, and the filing of such a petition did not bring
the Tunnel Company within the limited jurisdiction of the
District Court, and all action thereon was void. In re Kingston
Realty Co., 160 Fed. Rep. 445; Haul & Kaul Co. v. Friday,
3d Circuit Court of Appeals, Dec. 27, 1907; In re Mannering v.
Evans, 156 Fed. Rep. 109; In re Elmira Steel Co., 109 Fed. Rep.
456.
Prior to the adjudication, the record affirmatively showed
that the court was without jurisdiction, and the adjudication
and all proceedings thereon were void. In re Hill Co., 148
Fed. Rep. 832; In re PortlandCement Co., 156 Fed. Rep. 83, 85;
Remington on Bankruptcy, pp. 51, 84.
If the District Court has jurisdiction the bankruptcy act is
unconstitutional in that it deprives the unliquidated tort creditor of property without due process of law.
Under § 63a judgments arising ex delicto obtained prior to
the adjudication in bankruptcy are provable in bankruptcy.
In New York tort creditors having unliquidated claims may
attach the property of a corporation. Code of Civ. Pro., §635.
The liability to the tort claimant accrues upon the injury, not
upon its determination. Such claims, though not reduced to
judgment, are a class of property, especially in death cases, as
is that of complainant Riggs. In death by wrongful act the
statute prescribes how such property is to be distributed when
recovered. In this case the entire property of the Tunnel
Company was seized in bankruptcy without notice to tort creditors, an adjudication was made within one week in a summary

Argument for Respondents.

manner and the tort creditors are held to have no standing in
bankruptcy and are prohibited from asserting any rights or
claim to the property in the possession of a "Court of Equity."
Such practices, if proper under the statute, do not amount to
due process of law and the act is unconstitutional. Mason v.
Eldred, 6 Wall. 237; In re New York Tunnel Co., 166 Fed. Rep.
284.
Complainant is without relief other than by this petition,
and this court has jurisdiction thereof.
The complainant has not been guilty of laches and has exhausted every possible remedy without relief. This proceeding is justified by the practice of this court. Ex parte Bradley,
7 Wall. 364; Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313; Virginiav. Paul,
148 U. S. 107; Kentucky v. Powers, 201 U. S. 1; Ex parte Wisner, 203 U. S. 449; Pomeroy's Principles of Equity, § 109.
Mr. Charles K. Beekman for respondents:
Mandamus will not lie where its purpose is to perform the
office of appeal or writ of error, even if no appeal or writ of
error is allowed by law. American Construction Co. v. Jacksonville Railway, 148 U. S. 372; In re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323;
Ex parte Newman, 14 Wall 152; Ex parte Nebraska, 209 U. S.
436; In re Key, 189 U. S. 84.
An adjudication of bankruptcy cannot be attacked collaterally, and petitioner is not entitled to have the adjudication
set aside. Chapman v. Brewer, 114 U. S. 158 at 169; Edelstein
v. United States, 149 Fed. Rep. 636; In re American Brewing
Co., 112 Fed. Rep. 752; In re Worsham, 142 Fed. Rep. 121;

National Bank, 152 Fed. Rep. 70. See also Evers v. Watson,

214 U. S.

Allowing this writ would be equivalent to directing the District Court to reverse its own ruling, and also that of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and, in effect, to grant a mandamus to
compel a court and the judges thereof to decide a matter in a
particular way. Mandamus will not lie for such purpose. In
re Rice, 155 U. S. 396; In re Morrison, 147 U. S. 14; In re Pollitz, 206 U. S. 323; In re Burdett, 127 U. S. 771.
Original jurisdiction having been acquired by the District
Court, mandamus will not lie.
Only parties to the bankruptcy proceedings, such as creditors or the alleged bankrupt, can take advantage of the defects in pleadings, and then only by prompt and proper application. § 18. The petitioner is not even a creditor within the
meaning of the bankruptcy act. In Matter of N. Y. Tunnel
Co., 159 Fed. Rep. 688; In re Columbia Real Estate Co., 112
Fed. Rep. 643. See also In re Altonwood Park, 160 Fed. Rep.
448; National Bank v. Klug, 186 U. S. 202; In re Urban &
Title Co., 132 Fed. Rep. 140; In re Worsham, 142 Fed. Rep.

The petitioner's application for leave to intervene and plead
or to set aside the adjudication was addressed to the discretion of the court, and the exercise of this discretion will not be
disturbed by mandamus. Ex parte Taylor, 14 How. 3; In re
HabermanMfg. Co., 147 U. S. 525; Ex parte Railway Co., 101
U. S. 711 and eases there cited.
Mr. Justice BRwER delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an application by the petitioner for mandamus
against Judges Holt and Hough of the District Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York and the

MATTER OF RIGGS.
214 U1.S.

Opinion of the Court.

District Court of that district, commanding them and each of
them to dismiss all proceedings in bankruptcy against the New
York Tunnel Company, or, in the alternative, to reopen the
adjudication in bankruptcy and allow the petitioner or any
party in interest to appear and be heard in opposition to the
petition and adjudication thereof; or, in still further alternative, forbidding them from taking any further proceedings in
the matter of the tunnel company, its property, assets and

effects.
The facts, briefly stated, are that the tunnel company was
engaged in constructing a tunnel from New York to Brooklyn,
to be used for the purpose of a railroad between the boroughs
of Manhattan and Brooklyn. On May 23, 1907, certain creditors of the tunnel company filed a petition in bankruptcy in
the District Court of the Southern District of New York, upon
which petition, on May 29, 1907, Judge Holt entered an order
adjudicating it a bankrupt, and appointing a receiver. By
direction of the bankruptcy court the receiver proceeded with
the construction of the tunnel, and successfully completed the
work. At the time of the petition in bankruptcy this applicant
had an action pending in the State court to recover damages
on account of the death of her husband, resulting, as charged,
from the negligence of the tunnel company. On May 31, 1907,
Judge Holt issued an order to show cause why that action
should not be restrained, and proof of the claim be made before a special master. An order of restraint was granted upon
this application, which was afterwards set aside by the Court
of Appeals, and the applicant, on May 25, 1908, reduced her
claim to judgment.
It is contended by the applicant that although the petition
in bankruptcy alleged that the tunnel company was "engaged
in the business of building and contracting," it failed to show
that the principal business of the company was "trading,
printing, publishing, mining, manufacturing or a mercantile
pursuit," that being the language of the bankruptcy act of
1898, as amended.

OCTOBER TERM, 1908.
Opinion of the Court.

214 U. S.

We have recently given full consideration to the circumstances under which mandamus will be issued by this court to
restrain the action of inferior tribunals. In re Winn, 213 U. S.
458. Hence we deem it unnecessary to go into other details
of the proceedings in the bankruptcy or the state courts, nor
to consider the many questions fully and elaborately presented
in briefs and argued by counsel. Obviously, this application is
largely in the nature of a writ of error to review the action of
the District Court of the Southern District of New York and
its judges, and a writ of mandamus is no proper substitute for
a writ of error.
The allegation in the petition in bankruptcy is general in its
terms that the tunnel company is engaged in the business of
building and contracting, but it fails to disclose the particular
kind of work for which it is contracting or which it is engaged
in building. It might be inferred from the work which it was
shown it was doing in this particular case, as well as from its
name, that its principal business was that of contracting for
the construction of tunnels, but that would be only an inference and not conclusive. Its principal business may have been
that of manufacturing and contracting for such manufacturing, and this particular work only a small part of that which
it was generally engaged in. What evidence was presented to
the District Court to sustain the application for an adjudication in bankruptcy is not disclosed. We may not assume that
it was insufficient or that it failed to make certain or probable
that the principal business of the company was that of manufacturing and contracting for such manufacturing. We do not
deem it necessary to decide the question which is argued by
counsel, whether the adjudication of the bankruptcy court
can be challenged collaterally or whether indeed this is only a
collateral attack. Manson v. Williams, 213 U. S. 453. We
rest our conclusion upon the proposition that the District
Court in adjudicating the tunnel company a bankrupt was
called upon to decide, and did decide, a question of fact or of
mixed law and fact, and that such adjudication cannot be re-

viewed by proceedings in mandamus. In re Pollitz, 206 U. S.

The rule is discharged and the writ of mandamus denied.

WHITCOMB v. WHITE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAHO.
No. 185.

Argued April 28, 29, 1909.-Decided May 17, 1909.

Where a decision of the Land Department rests on the priority of
equitable rights of a contestant it is conclusive upon the courts so
far as it involves questions of fact; and on a mixed question of law
and fact it is conclusive unless the court can so separate the question
that the mistake of law is clearly apparent.
Where the controversy in the Land Department involves the question
of whether the first occupant occupied the land for homestead or
town-site entry, and there is evidence to support the Secretary's
finding, that finding is conclusive on the courts even though the
evidence be conflicting.
13 Idaho, 490, affirmed.
THIS was an action brought by John E. White and Roberta
B. White, his wife, in the District Court of the First Judicial
District of the State of Idaho, in and for the county of Kootenai, to recover the possession of the "northwest quarter of the
southwest quarter and lots five (5), six (6) and seven (7), of
section two (2), township fifty-five (55) north of range two
(2), east Boise meridian."
The defendants' answer was in the nature of a cross bill in
equity, admitting that the legal title to the premises was in
the plaintiffs, and seeking to charge them as holders of that
title in trust for the use and benefit of the defendants. A
trial before the court without a jury resulted in a judgment
for the plaintiffs for the recovery of possession and damages
