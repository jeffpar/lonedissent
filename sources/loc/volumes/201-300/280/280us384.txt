was that the domestic relations of husband and wife and
parent and child were matters reserved to the States, there
is no difficulty in construing the instrument. accordingly
and not much in dealing with the statutes. 'Suits against
consuls and vice-consuls' must be taken to refer to ordinary civil procecdings and not to include what formerly
would have belonged to the ecclesiastical Courts.
It is true that there may be objections of policy to one
of our States intermeddling with the domestic relations
of an official and subject of a foreign power that conceivably might regard jurisdiction as determined by nationality and not by domicil. But on the other hand if, as
seems likely, the wife was an American citizen, probably
she remained one notwithstanding her marriage. Act of
September 22, 1922, c. 411, § 3; 42 Stat. 1021, 1022. Her
position certainly is not less to be considered than her
husband's, and at all events these considerations are not
for us.
In the absence of any prohibition in the Constitution
or laws of the United States it is for the State to decide
how far it will go.
Judgment affirmed.

1. Under § 234 (a) (7) of the Revenue Act of 1918, which provides
that in computing the net income of corporations there shall be

although it became certain prior to that period that the good will
of the company would be destroyed by January 16, 1920, because
of prohibition legislation. P. 386.
2. When a business is extinguished as noxious under the Constitution,
the Government incurs no liability for compensation to the owners.

3. It will not be presumed that Congress intended to provide partial

"exhaustion" or "obsolescence" of the good will of the business.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

This is a suit brought by the respondent to recover
income and profits taxes paid under protest, on the
ground, as stated by its counsel, that it was not allowed
to deduct from gross income "a reasonable allowance for
the exhaustion, including obsolescence, of its good will
. . . it having become certain prior to that period that
the useful life of the good will would be terminated by
January 16, 1920 because of prohibition legislation." The
question turns on the Revenue Act of 1918, (Act of
February 24, 1919), c. 18, § 234 (a) (7); 40 Stat. 1057,
1078, allowing as deductions, inter alia, "A reasonable
allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of property
used in the trade-or business, including a reasonable allowance for obsolescence." The good will was that of a
brewery and is found to have been destroyed by prohibition legislation. The deduction claimed is for the fiscal
year ending May 31, 1919, it having been apparent early
in 1918 that prohibition was imminent, and the officers
having taken steps to prepare for the total or partial
liquidation of the Company. The amount of the deduction to be made is agreed upon if any deduction is to be
allowed.
We shall not follow counsel into the succession of regulations or the variations in the law before the date of the
Act that we have to construe. In our opinion the words
now used cannot be extended to cover the loss in this
case and it is needless to speculate as to what other cases
it might include. It seems to us plain without help from
Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, that when a business is
extinguished as noxious under the Constitution the owners
cannot demand compensation from the Government, or
a partial compensation in the form of an abatement of
taxes otherwise due. It seems to us no less plain that
Congress cannot be taken to have intended such a partial
compensation to be provided for by the words 'exhaustion' or 'obsolescence,'
Neither word is apt to describe

termination by law as an evil of a business otherwise
flourishing, and neither becomes more applicable because
the death is lingering rather than instantaneous. It is
incredible that Congress by an Act approved on February
24, 1919, should have meant to enable parties to cut down
their taxes on such grounds because of an amendment to
the Constitution that it had submitted to the legislatures
of the States in 1917 and that had been ratified by the
legislatures of a sufficient number of States the month
before the present Act was passed.

THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 114.

Argued January 17, 1930.-Decided January 27, 1930.

1. Under § 214 (a) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1918 and § 214 (a)
(8) of the Revenue Act of 1921, which provide that in computing
net income there shall be allowed as deductions to individuals
"a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion, wear and tear of
property used in the trade or business, including a reasonable
allowance for obsolescence," the owner of a distillery and wholesale
liquor business is not entitled to a deduction for the "exhaustion"
or "obsolescence" of good will-treated as embracing trade-marks,
trade brands and trade names-during the years 1918, 1919, 1920,
and 1922, because of federal legislation which proscribed the
business. Following Clarke v. Haberle Crystal Springs Brewing
Co., ante, p. 384. P. 389.
