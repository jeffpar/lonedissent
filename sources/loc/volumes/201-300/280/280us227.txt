would affect only those entitled to share in the proceeds
of property beyond his control.
The broad purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to bring
about an equitable distribution of the bankrupt's estate
among creditors holding just demands based upon adequate consideration.- Any agreement which-tends to defeat that beneficent design must be regarded with disfavor. Considering the time which the lease here involved had to run, nothing else appearing, it seems plain
enough that the real design of- the challenged provision
was to insure to the lessor preferential treatnent in the
event of bankruptcy. The record discloses no circumstance sufficient to support a contrary view. If the term
wire much shorter, or there were facts tending to disclose
a, proper purpose, the argument in favor of the lessor
would be more persuasive.
The decree of the court below must be reversed. The
judgment of the District Court will be affirmed ,and the
cause remanded there for further appropriate proceedings.

Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed a recovery in an
action against the Collector for money paid under protest
as income taxes.

Mr. Claude R. Branch, with whom Solicitor General
Hughes, Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, and
Messrs. Sewall Key and J. Louis Monarch, Special Assistants tt the Attorney General, were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. John M. Zane, with whom Mr. Henry A. Gardner
was on the brief, for respondent.

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The respondent owns a one-sixth interest in several
leases executed 1901, 1902, 1903, and 1905, which authorize the lessee to take iron ore from certain Minnesota lands
fqr twenty-five, forty-five and fifty years from their respective dates. These leases require payments quarterly
of 25 cents royalty per ton upon all ore extracted; pro.vide. for minimum annual production and termination
under specified circumstances.
During the year 1917 she received out of such royalties.
$2.60,072.30; during 1918, $219,940.43. For 1917 she was
allowed $99,561.20 asdepletion; for 1918, $84,979.55. Income tax was assessed against her upon the balances and
payment exacted. Thereafter she unsuccessfully claimed
refunds-because the sums allowed for depletion were insufficient. The present suit followed.

Opinion of the Court.

The Revenue Act of 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1066,
1067, (approved February 24, 1919) provides"Sec. 214. (a) That in computing net income-there
shall be allowed as deductions:
"(10) In the case of mines, oil and gas wells, other
natural deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for
depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions in each case, based upon
cost including cost of development not otherwise deducted: Provided, That in the case of such properties acquired prior to March 1, 1913, the fair market value of
the property (or the taxpayer's interest therein) on that
date shall be taken in lieu of cost up to that date: Provided further, That in' the case of mines, oil and gas wells,
discovered by the taxpayer, on or aft er March 1, 1913,
and not acquired as the result of purchase of a proven
tract or lease, where the fair market value of the property
is materially disproportionate to the cost, the depletion
allowance shall be based upon the fair market value of the
property at the date of the discovery, or within thirty
days thereafter; such reasonable allowance in all the above
cases to be made under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Coihmissioner with the approval of the
Secretary. In the case of leases the deductions allowed
by this paragraph shall be equitably apportioned between
the lessor and.lessee."

fers from the corresponding provision in the act of 1918,
supra, in any way here material.
In her claim presented to the tax officer for refund of
overpayment for 1917 respondent said"Tax as assessed is based upon income received from.
royalties from iron ore mines. Depletion amounting to
$99,561.20 was allowed to taxpayer, whereas depletion
amounting to $203,510.86 should be allowed. The latter
amount is the present worth of the ore 'mined in 1917, as
of March 1, 1913, and is arrived at by discounting the
amount received in 1917 at 5% to March 1, 1913."
A like statement appears in her claim concerning overpayment for 1918.
The declaration has two counts.

The first, relating to

payments for 1917, alleges"That the value or market price of said ore in the
ground untouched and unextracted on .March 1, 1913,
and on all dates subsequent thereto, exceeded the sum
of twenty-five cents per ton, so that every ton of ore
paid for under said leases in the year 1917 was disposed
of at a price actually less than the market price of the
ore, and if then sold free of said lease, would have realized
more than twenty-five cents per ton. The actual deplenot to exceed the market value in the mine of the product thereof,
which has been mined and sold during the year for which the return
and computation are made, such reasonable allowance to be made in
the case of both (a) and (b) under rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury:. Provided, That when the
allowances authorized in (a) and (b) shall equal the capital originally invested, or in case of purchase made prior to March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, the fair market value as of'that date, no
further allowance shall be made. No deduction shall be allowed for
any amount paid out for new buildings, permanent improvements, or
betterments, madd to increase the value of any property or estate,
,and no deduction shall be made for ahy amount of expense of restoring property or making good the exhaustion thereof for which an
allowance is or has been made."

REINECKE v. SPALDING.

Opinion of the Court.

tion of the mines by each ton of ore extracted was more
than twenty-five cents when extracted.
",That under the terms of the law the depletion for
ore extracted or considered to be extracted was fixed at
the market value of the ore in place in the mine at the
time and place of extraction, but if such depletion allowance per ton exceeded the amount fixed as the royalty
per ton in the lease, the depletion allowance to the plaintiff could not exceed such royalty, but since the royalty
when paid included an amount of interest on the payment considered as deferred from March 1, 1913 to the
date of actual payment of royalty and (sic) the allowance of such depletion in successive years could never
exceed the market value of the ore in the mine on
March 1, 1913.
(" That each payment for ore extracted consisted of
two parts, one of which was interest on the deferred
l-ayment and the other of which was the actual present
worth of the payment deferred from March 1, 1913'.
Said actual present worth is accurately represented for
each ton by that sum which put at interest on March
1, 1913, would produce at the date of payment for ore
the royalty paid per ton; to put it in another way, the
actual present worth of the ore extracted is accurately
ascertained by taking from the royalty per ton paid, the
part of the royalty, when and as paid, which represented
interest on the deferred payment from March 1, 1913.
"That such an allowance of depletion in successive
years and in the year 1917 did not and could not exceed
the market value of such ore on March 1, 1913.
"That if of each payment for each ton of ore extracted, the amount of such payment which represents
interest on the payment as deferred and actually paid,
be figured, the income of the owner will be accurately

determined as that part of the twenty-five cents, which
represents interest.
"That for the year 1917 a correct calculation under
the rule above shows that upon the tons of ore extracted
and paid for on January 14,1917, of the payment of 250 per
ton $0.2095 was for selling price or principal and $0.0405
was interest on the deferred payments and that on the
330,507'tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $69,251.05; that upon the ore paid for on April
10, 1917, $0.2074 was for selling price or principal and
$0.0426 was interest on the deferred payments and that
on the 48,958 tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to
depletion of $10,153.29; that on the ore paid for on July
.10, 1917, $0.2053 was for selling price .or principal and
$0.0447 was interest on the deferred payments and that
on the 231,090 tons extracted plaintiff was entitled to
depletion of $47,434.55; that upon the ore paid for on
October 10, 1917, $0.2032 was for selling price or principal
and $0.0468 was interest on the deferred payments and
that on the 432,120 tons extracted the plaintiff was entitled to depletion of $87,791.42; that'plaintiff is entitled
to depletion amounting for the year 1917 to $214,630.31."
.Count two contains similar allegations concerning the
payment for 1918.
In the trial court, after requests by both sides for
directed Verdict, the respondent had judgment and this
was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
The latter court said"The sole controversy is over the correctness of the
Government's method of arriving at the value of the iron
ore in the ground on March 1, 1913, a matter not covered
by the revenue acts in question, nor by any regulation of
the Treasury Department."
This does not accurately state our understanding of
the issue. It was ne'essary.for the taxpayer to show the
illegality of the exactions. "The burden of establishing

that fact rested upon it, in order to show that it was
entitled to the deduction which the Commissioner had
disallowed, and that the additional tax was to that extent
illegally assessed." Botany Mills v. Uhited States, 278
U. S. 282, 289, 290; United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S.
422, 443. The real point is whether respondent established her claim for refund by adequate evidence. And
we think she did not.
On March 1,' 1913, she was the lessor of mines from
which the lessee had the right to extract ore during many
years, paying therefor when taken out 25 cents per ton.
Her rights were merely to receive the royalties stipulated
and to regain possession when the leases terminated.
Manifestly, the fair market value of this interest in 1913
was much less than 25 cents per ton of the estimated
contents of the mines, but respondent introduced no evidence which tended to show such value. The suggestion
that market value per ton on March 1, 1913, was equivalent to the sum which if then put at simple interest would
have amounted to 25 cents when the ore was actually
taken out and the stipulated royalty became payable car.
not be accepted. This method of estimation would decrease the 1913 market value with the passing of every
year. Moreover it disregards the fact that respondent's
interest was in the, mines considered as entireties and not
in particular parts of ore beds which the lessee had agreed
to remove during designated future years.
Under the statute it became necessary for respondent
to establish the fair market value of her interest in the
.mines on March 1, 1913, or at least that such value was
not below what she claimed it was. Otherwise, she could
not recover. She introduced three witnesses who testified
as to ore values. No one of them gave an estimate of the
value of her interest at that time. Replying to the 4uestion, "You do not mean to testify that Mrs. Spalding's
.interest in that ton of ore as of March 1, 1913, or at any.

other time, was worth 25 cents or any other sum," one of
them said: "That question is based upon Mrs. Spalding's
one-sixth ownership of a lease at 25 cents per ton. That
question is anentirely different one from the one asked
me by Mr. Zane. It would require a good deal of calculation and certain assumptions as to how fast that ore
would be shipped. Then it would require discounting
against those assumptions to present value. That calculation would take time, and I can not answer that
without working it out." The other two gave no estimate
of such value.
The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The
cause will be remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
