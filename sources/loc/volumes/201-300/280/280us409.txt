COOPER v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 93. Argued January 15, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1930.
The Revenue Act of November 23, 1921, effective from the beginning of that calendar year, provides, ยง 202 (a) (2), that, in
ascertaining the gain from a sale of property acquired after
February 28, 1913, the basis shall be the cost, and that in case
of property acquired by gift after December 31, 1920, "the basis
shall be the same as that which it would have in the hands of
the donor or the last preceding owner by whom it was not acquired by gift." In November, 1921, A gave to B shares which
A had bought in 1918 and which had increased in value. B sold
them at that increased value within a week and was taxed on the
basis of the difference between the price paid by A and the price
received by B. Held:

MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Petitioner paid income taxes assessed according to her
return foi the calendar year 1921; thereafter, by suit in
the Court of Claims she sought to recover a portion of
the same ($8,474.00) with interest, which she alleged had
been improperly exacted.
Her return showed $36,670.00 as gain derived from the
sale of 380 shares of bank stock sold November 7, 1921,
at $210.00 per share. She acquired this stock November
1, 1921, by gift from her husband. On that day its fair
market value was $210.00 per share; in 1918 it cost her
husband $113.50 per share.
The challenged assessment was made under Section 202
(a) (2), Revenue Act, November 23, 1921, effective (Sec.
263) January 1, 1921. Chap. 136, 42 Stat. 227, 229.
"Sec. 202 (a). That the basis for ascertaining the gain

Opinion of the Court.

First, that Sec. 202 (a) (2) should not be construed as
applicable to transactions fully completed before enactment of the statute. Second, that if construed to apply
where both gift and sale were consummated before such
enactment the section is arbitrary and capricious and,
therefore, invalid under the due process clause of the
Fifth Amendment.
To support the first point Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U. S.
529, is cited; for the second Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S.
531; Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142; Untermyer v.
Anderson, 276 U. S. 440, are relied upon.
We think the purpose of Congress to apply the provisions of See. 202 (a) (2) to the transaction here involved is clear. Shwab v. Doyle grew out of the Revenue
Act of Sept. 8, 1916. There, after considering the relevant
circumstances, we declared there was no intention to give
retroactive effect to the enactment. Here, the contrary
design is not doubtful.
The power of Congress to tax as part of. a donee's income the difference between what the gift cost the donor
and the price received therefor when sold by the donee was
affirmed in Taft v. Bowers, 278 U. S.470, and is not now
denied.
That the questioned provision can not be declared in
conflict with the Federal Constitution merely because it
requires gains from prior but recent transactions to be
treated as part of the taxpayer's gross income has not
been open to serious doubt since Brushaber v. Union
PacificR. Co., 240 U. S.1, and Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U. S.
339.
Nichols v. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531, held arbitrary and
capricious a statute which required executors to pay an
excise ostensibly laid upon the transfer of property by
death, but reckoned upon its value plus the value of other
property conveyed by the decedent before the enactment
in entire good faith and without contemplation of death,
and said that to enforce it would amount to confiscation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Syllabus.

280 U. S.

Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, and Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440, considered the validity of an enactment which laid a tax upon donors because of gifts fully

consummated prior to its passage. We held this was beyond
the power of Congress. None of these cases is in point;
they gave no consideration to the power of Congress to require that taxable income should include profits from
transactions consummated within the year.
We can find nothing unusual, arbitrary or capricious
in the provision of the taxing Act here involved, and the
judgment of the court below must be affirmed.
Affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.

Nos. 128, 129, 130. Argued January 21, 1930.--Decided February
24, 1930.
1. The Act of September 8, 1916, ยง 13, par. (d), in providing that a
corporation which keeps its accounts upon any basis other than
that of actual receipts and disbursements, may, subject to regulations, make its income return upon the basis of its accounts "unless
that basis does not clearly reflect the income, refers to the general
bookkeeping system followed by the taxpayer and not to the accuracy or propriety of mere individual items or entries upon the
books. P. 419.
2. Therefore, where the books of corporations, kept upon the accrual
basis, and returns upon that basis, contained excessive inventory
valuations and thereby indicated net incomes much too small, the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue properly corrected the erroneous
valuations and made reassessments upon the returns as so modified.
His rejection of the errors was not a rejection of the basis upon
