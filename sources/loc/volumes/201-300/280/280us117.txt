rights of Herbring himself in conducting the business of
an insurance agent, is without merit.
2. The appellant also urges in argument, that "if the
statute be regarded as a corporate regulation, rather than
as an individual prohibition, it is unconstitutional, in
that it is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious" and
cannot be sustained under the police power of the State.
In other words, he seeks in argument to challenge the
validity of the statute on the ground that it is an infringement of the Company's constitutional right to appoint an additional agent. The Company ifself is not
here insisting that the statute constitutes an impairment
of its own right; it raised no such question before the
Commissioner, and for aught that appears acquiesced in
that officer's view of the validity of the statute.
It may well be that under the facts in this case Herbring's individual interest in this question is not direct
but merely collateral and remote and not such as would
have entitled him to challenge the constitutional validity
of the statute on the ground that it is an impairment of
the Company's own rights. But, however that may be,
there is no assignment of error here which challenges
the validity of the statute on that ground; and the question which Herbring seeks to raise in argument, is not
before us for decision.
The judgment is
Affirmed.

negligence in the operation of an automobile.
Mr. Thomas R. Robinson, with whom Messrs. David

appellee.
Assuming, as we must, the power of the legislature to
regulate the operation of motor vehicles, it includes the
power to enact legislation affecting the reciprocal rights
and duties of all who use them, whether he be owner,
operator or occupant, where these rights and duties arise
out of such operation. Buelke v. Levenstadt, 190 Cal.

Packard v. Banton, 264 U. S. 140; Minnesota Iron Co. V.
Kline, 199 U. S. 593.

Since motor vehicles have come into general use they
have been classified separately from other methods of
transportation, and the power of the legislature to impose
upon their owners and operators duties different from
those of owners and operators of other vehicles has been
generally upheld. Berry, Automobiles, Vol. 1, ยง 30; Garrett v. Turner, 235 Pa. St. 383; Westfall v. Chicago, 280
IlL 318; Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S.615.
The fact that the law applies only to motor vehicles
does not create an unreasonable classification of vehicles
using the road, is not an unlawful discrimination against a
particular class, and does not deny the equal protection of
the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
Christy v. Elliott, 216 Ill. 31; Hendrick v. Maryland,
supra;State v. Mayo, 106 Me. 62; State v. Swagerty, 203
Mo. 517.
There is nothihg arbitrary or unreasonable in applying
a different standard of duty toward a gratuitous passenger
in a motor vehicle as distinguished from one being transported for compensation-hence the exception of the
common carrier by the statute is valid. Massalette v.
Fitzroy, 228 Mass. 508; Giblin v. McMullen, L. R. 2 P. C.

One owning and operating a motor vehicle upon the
highways of the State of Connecticut is exercising a privilege and not a right, and it is competent for the legislature
to prescribe the conditions upon which said privilege shall
be exercised. Commonwealth v. Kingsbury, 199 Mass.

The deprivation of a common law right does not make
the Act unconstitutional, for a legislature may suspend
the operation of general law. Buelke v. Levenstadt, 190
Cal. 684; Carrozzav. Finance Co., 149 Md. 223.
In a classification for governmental purposes, there
cannot be an exact exclusion or inclusion of persons and
things. Orient Ins. Co. v. Daggs, 172 U. S. 562. Technical inequalities do not offend against the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Louisville &

MR. JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an appeal under ยง 237 of the Judicial Code, as
amended by Act of February 13, 1925, from a judgment
of the Supreme Court of Connecticut upholding the constitutionality of a state statute. Chapter 308 of the Public Acts of Connecticut of 1927 (printed in the margin 1)
I Chapter 308. An Act releasing owners of motor vehicles from
responsibility for injuries to passengers therein.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in
General Assembly convened:
Section 1. No person transported by the owner or operator of a
motor vehicle as his guest without payment for such transportation
shall have a cause of action for damages against such owner or
operator for injury, death or loss, in case of accident, unless such
accident shall have been intentional on the part of said owner or
operator or caused by his heedlessness or his reckless disregard of the
rights of others.
Sec. 2. This act shall not relieve a public carrier or any owner or
operator of a motor vehicle while the same is being demonstrated to
a prospective purchaser of responsibility for any injuries sustained
by a passenger being transported by such public carrier or by' such
owner or operator.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

provides that no person carried gratuitously as a guest
in an automobile may recover from the owner or operator
for injuries caused by its negligent operation. The appellant brought suit in the Superior Court of New Haven
County against appellee, her husband, for injuries so sustained. Judgment for the defendant was affirmed by the
Supreme Court. Both courts ruled that the statute barred
appellant, a guest carried gratuitously, from recovery
for injuries caused by ordinary negligence in the operation of the car, and the Supreme Court, by divided bench,
held that the statute did not deny to appellant the equal
protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth
Amendment.
As the record does not disclose the constitutional
grounds on which the appellant challenged the validity
of the statute, our review will be limited to the single
question arising under the Federal Constitution which
was considered in the opinion of the court below. Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260. We need not, therefore, elaborate the rule that the Constitution floes not
forbid the creation of new rights, or the abolition of old
ones recognized by the common law, to attain a, permissible legislative object. See Louis Pizitz Dry Goods Co. v.
Yeldell, 274 U. S. 112, 116; New York Central R. Co.
v. White, 243 U. S. 1SS; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S.219; Wilmington Mining Co. v. Fulton,
205 U. S. 60, 74.
The use of the automobile as an instrument of transportation is peculiarly the subject of regulation.- We
can not assume-that there are no evils to be corrected or
permissible social objects to be gained by the present
statute. We are not unaware of the increasing frequency
of litigation in which passengers carried gratuitously in
automobiles, often casual guests or licensees, have sought
the. rrecovery of large sums for injuries alleged to have

SILVER v. SILVER.

Opinion of the Court.

been due to negligent operation. In some jurisdictions it
has been judicially determined that a lower standard of
care should be exacted where the carriage in any type
of vehicle is gratuitous. See Massaletti v. Fitzroy, 228
Mass. 487; Marcienowski v. Sanders, 252 Mass. 65; Epps
v. Parrish, 26 Ga. App. 399. Whether there has been a
serious increase in the evils of vexatious litigation in this
class of cases, where the carriage is by automobile, is for
legislative determination and, if found, may well be the
basis of legislative action further restricting the liability.
Its wisdom is not the concern -of courts.
It is said that the vice in the statute ,is not that it distinguishes between passengers who' pay and those who
do not, but between gratuitous passengers in automobiles
and those in other classes of vehicles. But it is not so
evident that no grounds exist for the distinction that we
can say a priori that the classification is one forbidden
as without basis, and arbitrary. See Clarke v. Deckebach,
274 U. S. 392, 397.
Grantdd that the liability to be imposed upon those who
operate any kind of vehicle for the benefit of a mere
guest or licensee is an appropriate subject of legislative
restriction, there is no constitutional requirement that a
regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every
class to which it might be applied-that the legislature
must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all ornone. Patsone v. Pennsylvania,232 U. S.. 138,.144; Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373, 382, 384; International
Harvester Co. v. Missouri, 234 U. S. 199, 215; Barrett v.
Indiana, 229 U. S. 26, 29 (1913). In this day of almost
universal highway transportation by motor car, we cannot say that abuses originating in the multiplicity of
suits growing out -of -the gratuitous carriage of passengers
in automobiles do. not present so conspicuous an ex amplq
of what the legislature may regard as an evil, as to justify

legislation aimed at it, even though some abuses may not
be hit. Carrollv. Greenwich Ins. Co., 199 U. S. 401, 411;
Bryant v. Zimmerman, 278 U. S. 63, 73. It is enough
that the present statute strikes at the evil where it is
felt and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently
occurs.

CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 27. Argued October 3.1, 1929.-Decided November 25, 1929.
1. The tax imposed by Revenue Act of 1924, ยงยง 319-324, as amended
by Revenue Act of 1926, ยง 324, upon transfers of property by
gift, is not a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitutiqn,
but an excise on the exercise of one of the powers incident to
ownership, and need not be-apportioned. Coast., Art. I, ยงยง 2, 8, 9.
P. 135.

2. The uniformity of taxation throughout the United States enjoined
by Art. I, ยง 8, is geographic, not intrinsic. P. 138.
3. The graduations of the tax, and the exemption of gifts aggregating
$50,000, gifts to any one person that do not exceed 8500, and
certain -gifts for religious, charitable, educational, scientific and
like purposes, are consistent with the uniformity clause, and
with the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Id.
4. The schemes of graduation and exemption in the statute, by
which the tax levied upon donors of the same total amounts may
be affected by the size of the gifts to individual donecs, are not
so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive the taxpayer of
property without due process. P. 139.

of Appeals tipon review of a judgment for the Collector
in a suit by Bromley, a resident of the United States, to
recover a tax alleged to have been illegally levied upon
gifts made by him.
