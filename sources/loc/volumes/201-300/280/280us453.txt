WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIFTH AND

Nos. 118 and 414.

FIRST CIRCUITS RESPECTIVELY.

Argued January 13, 14, 1930.-Decided February
24, 1930.

1. Although the Revenue Act of 1918 was not approved until February 24, 1919, § 241(a) required that returns on the basis of the
calendar year be made on or before March 15, and § 239 required
that a corporation's return should state specifically the items of its
gross income and deductions and credits. In order to allow corporations extended time to prepare their returns under § 239,
and in order to avoid the postponement of initial payments of
tax that would have resulted, under § 250(a), if extensions were
granted unconditionally, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
devised a plan whereby extensions of time to file the return require d by the Act were granted to corporations only on condition
that, on or before March 15, they send to the Collector one-fourth
of their estimated tax with an instrument executed under oath,
containing only a statement that one-fourth of the estimated tax
was remitted therewith and that, for reasons set forth, an extension
of time to file the " complete return" was requested. The form
provided by the Commissioner for this purpose was entitled " Tentative Return of Corporation Income and Profits Taxes and Request
for Extension of Time for Filing Return." Held:
That this so-called "tentative return" was not the return within
the meaning of § 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, limiting
the time within which taxes under the Act of 1918 might be
determined and assessed to five years after the return wlas filed,
etc., and that the filing of such "tentative return" did not start
that period of limitation. P. 456.
2. A waiver executed by the Commissioner and a taxpayer pursuant
to § 250(d) of the Revenue Act of 1921, consenting to a determination, assessment and collection of income taxes under the

Act of 1918, and to be ini effect for one year after the expiration
o)f the statutory period of limitation, was not a contract preventing Congress from extending the statutory period for the
collection of such taxcs, by legislation enacted before that period
as extended by the waiver h'as expired. P. 465.
38. Income taxes assessed within the t: itutory period, as extended
by waiver, and after the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1924,
the collection of which had not been previously barred, could be
'ollected pursuant to §§ 27S(d) of that Act at any time within
six years of the ass essment. P. 467.
4. Income taxes assessed at any time within the statutory period, as
extended by waiver, and the collection of which was not barred on
the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1926, could be collected
under § 278(d) of that Act within six years of the assessment. Id.
29 F. (2d) S95, affirmed; 33 F. (2d) 739, reversed.

Key and Barham. R. Gary, Special Assistants to the Attorney General, were on the brief, for the United States
and the Collector of Internal Revenue.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.

These cases, which were argued together, present the
same questions. In each case, the taxpayer seeks to recover with interest an amount assessed and collected, after
March 15, 1925, as an additional income and excess-profits
tax for 1918 under the Revenue Act of 1918. In each, the
claim is that both the assessment and the collection were
made after the expiration of the time allowed therefor.
In a long line of cases arising out of similar facts, the
Board of Tax Appeals has held consistently that neither
the assessment nor the collection was made too late.
In
No. 414 the action was brought in the federal court for
Massachusetts against the Collector to recover $39,043.99.
The District Court, without passing on the timeliness of
the assessment, held that the collection was barred and
entered judgment for the plaintiff, 28 F. (2d) 54. The
Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed
the judgment on the ground that the assessment was
barred, and expressed no opinion on the question decide.[

action was brought in the federal court for western Louisiana against the United States to recover $11,282.15.

Opinion of the Court.

That court, deciding both questions in favor of the Govermnent, entered a judgment for the defendant, 26 F.
(2d) 505, which was affirmed, on both grounds, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, 29.F. (2d)
S95. In other federal courts, also, there has been diversity
of opinion.2 This Court granted writs of certiorari.
First. Whether the assessment was barred depends upon
whether the period of limitation was started by the filing
before March 15, 1919, of a so-called "tentative return,"
or by the later filing of a so-called "completed return."
The question arises in this way. The Revenue Act of
1918 was not approved until February 24, 1919; c. 18,
40 Stat. 1057. Section 241 (a) required that returns on
the basis of the calendar year should be made on or before
the 15th day of March. Section 239 required that a corporation's return should state "specifically the items of its
gross income and the deductions and credits allowed."
The form of return prescribed by the Commissioier of
Internal Revenue for giving this information, known as
Form 1120, is'an elaborate document composed of a "summary" in four schedules, with eleven supporting schedules
and twenty-six sub-schedules. The "summary" calls for
the specification of some 93 items. The supporting
schedules and sub-schedules call for the specification of
some 357 items; and of as many more items to be stated.
in appendices as the circumstances of. the particular taxpayers might require.:'
2 In Brandon Corporation v. Jones, 33 F. (2d) 969 (D. C. E. D. S.
Car.), it was held that both assessment and collection were barred.
Aid see Rasmussen v. Brownfield-Canty Carpet Co., 31 F. (2d) 89.
In the following cases it was held that collection was not barred;
the timeliness of the assessment was not questioned: Bank of Commerce v. Rose, 26 F. (2d) 365 (D. C. N. D. Ga.); Loewer Realty Co.
v. Anderson, 31 F. (2d) 26S (C. C. A. 2d); L. Loewy & Son, Inc. v.
Commissioner, 31 F. (2d) 652 (C. C. A. 2d).
3 The form described is known as Form 1120, "Corporation Income
and Profits Tax Return For Calendar Year 1918," and is a combined
return of income, excess-profits and war-profits under the Revenue

Opinion of the Court.

It was obvious that many corporations would be unable, in the short interval between February 24 and March
15, to prepare their returns in time. Sections 227 (a)
and 241 (a) authorized the Commissioner to " grant a
reasonable extension of time for filing returns whenever
in his judgment good cause exists." But § 250 (a) provided that " where an extension of time for filing a return
is granted the time for payment of the first installment
shall be postponed until the (late of the expiration of the
period of the extension." The necessities of the Government made it undesirable that payments on account of
the first instalment of taxes be postponed. To meet this
situation, the following policy was announced in a public
statement issued by the Commissioner: "Although no general extension of time will be authorized for filing the
Federal Income Tax returns due 1\arch 15, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has approved a novel feature
of tax collection which will serve for all practical purposes as a possible extension of forty-five days for the
filing of corporation ,income and excess profits tax returns
.

.

.

If a corporation finds that

.

.

.

it is impossible

to complete its return by March 15, it may make a return
of the estimated tax due and make payment thereof not
later than March 15. If meritorious reason is shown,"
the completed return could be filed within forty-five days
Act of 1918. Statutes imposing direct taxes have always required taxpayers to file "lists" or " schedules " or " statements " or " returns
specifying in detail the information requisite for an assessment of the
tax. The word " return" has not always been used. Sometimes it
has been used as a synonym for "list," "schedule" or "statement."
The specification in the statutes of the prescribed contents of such
lists or returns has varied in its detail. But always definite statements
of facts were required, from which the tax could be computed. Act
of July 9, 1798, c. 70, § 9, 1 Stat. 580, 585-6; Act of July 1, 1862,

after that date. The statement continued: " Provision
for systematically handling this new feature will be made
in the construction of the new return blanks. . . embodied in which is a. detachable letter of remittance. Any
corporation which finds that, for sufficient reasons, it cannot complete its return by March 15, may detach and fill
out the letter of remittance, and forward same to the
collector on or before March 15, together with a check
*
, for the tax due on that date. . . . A statement
in writing of the reasons why it is impossible for the
corporation to complete the return by the specified date
must accompany every such remittance." ' The device
was modified by a. further statement. on February 27,
1919. A separate blank, known as Form 1031T and
entitled " Tentative Return and Estimate of Corporation
Income and Profits Taxes and Request for Extension of
Time for Filing Return," was to be used instead of the
detachable letter of remittance. This blank was in the
form of a letter to the collector and contained, besides
instructions and the oath of the president and treasurer,
only a statement that one-fourth of the estimated amount
of taxes was remitted therewith and that an extension of
time to file the complete return was requested for the
reasons stated.
Each corporation executed the tentative return, Form
1031T, and sent it, with a remittance of one-quarter of
the estimated tax, to the collector on or before March 15,
1919. The Florsheim Company filed its complete return,
.

.'This action was taken pursuant to § 1309, which authorizcd the
Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, "to inake all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of the provisions of this
Act." .These public letters from the Commissioner to the Collectors
"and others concerned" were issued February 13, 1919; February
27, 1919. See also let'ters of April 14, 1919, October 3, 191.9, and

Form 1120, onl June 16, 1919; the Hood Company, oil
July 14, 1919. Section 250 (d) of the Revenue Act of
1918 provided that " the amount of tax, due under any
return shall be determined and assessed by the Commissioner within five years after the return was due or was
made . . ." This period was extended under the
Revenue Act of 1921, November 23, 1921, c.136, § 250 (d).
42 Stat. 227, 265-6, which provided that the amount of the
tax under the 191S Act should be " determined and assessed within five years after the return was filed, unless
both the Commissioner and the taxpayer consent in writing to a later determination, assessment, and collection
of the tax." ' In each of the cases at bar, the Cominissioner and the taxpayers executed, prior to March 15,
1924, an instrument called " Income and Profits Tax
Waiver." The waivers stated that "In pursuance of the
provisions of subdivision (d) of section 250 of the revenue
act of 1921," the Commissioner and the taxpayer " consent
to a determination, assessment, and collection of the
amount of income, excess-profits, or war-profits taxes due
under any return mhade. . . . This waiver isin effect
from the date it is signed by the taxpayer and will remain in effect for a period of one year after the expiration of the statutory period of limitations. . ." In
each case, the assessment was made more than six years
after March 15, 1919, but within six years after the filing
of the completed return on Form 1120. If Form 1031T
was "the return " within the meaning of the above provisions as to limitation, then the assessments were made
too late.
We are of opinion that the filing of the document known
as Form 1031T, duly executed, did not start the running

of the period of limitation. Form 1031T is not an instrument expressly provided for in the Act. It is not in the
nature of a "list," "schedule," or " return," commonly
required by tax statutes. It was an invention of the Commissioner designed to meet a peculiar exigency. *Its purpose was to secure to the taxpayers a needed extension of
time for filing the required return, without defeating the
Government's right to prompt payment of the first instalment. As Form 1031T made no reference to income, or to
deductions or credits, it could not have been intended as
the return " stating specifically the items of
gross income, and the deductions and credits "-the return required to satisfy the statute.
Section 3182 of the Revised Statutes, U. S. C. Tit. 26,
§ 102, provides that the Commissioner shall " make the
inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes
shall certify a list of such assessments
. . .and
. . . to the proper collectors." Section 250 (b) of the
1918 Act required that " as soon as practicable after the
return is filed, the Commissioner shall examine it. If it
then appears that the correct amount of the tax is greater
or less than that shown in the return, the installments shall
be recomputed." It was to serve these purposes that
§ 239 required all corporations to make returns " stating
specifically the items of . . . gross income and the
deductions and credits." The burden of supplying by the
return the information on which assessments were to be
based was thus imposed upon the taxpayer. And, in providing that the period of limitation should begin on the
date when the return was filed, rather than when it,was
due, the statute plainly manifested a purpose that the
period was to commence only when the taxpayer had supplied this information in the prescribed manner. Form
1120 provided for furnishing the data which would enable
the Commissioner to make a determination, assessmient
and recomputation. Form 1031T furnished no data which

453

Opinion of the Court.

could, in any way, aid him in that connection. It is true
that even the complete return on Form 1120 need not be
accepted by the Commissioner as the sole basis for the
determination of the amount of the tax. Assessments are
frequently based on audits of the Income Tax Unit.
However, the purpose of these audits is not to eliminate
the necessity of filing the return, but to safeguard against
error or dishonesty.
The corporations concede that § 239 defined the nature
of the return required and referred to in the several provisions of the Act, and that Form 1031T did not comply
with that section;_ but, in support of their contention that
the tentative return, Form 1031T, started the running
of the period of limitation, they present the following
arguments. They urge that the sufficiency of a return
for the purpose of starting the period of limitations does
not depend upon a strict compliance with the requirements of § 239; that the Act required but one return,
that Form 1031T was a formal document prescribed by
the Commissioner, called a "return " and so termed on
its face, and that the complete return should, therefore,
be treated as an amendment or completion of the tentative return; that Form 1031T was a sufficient return to
start the period of limitation, because it was sufficient
to prevent the extension of time for the payment of the
first instalment of the tax pursuant to § 250 (a); because
it was a sufficient return under § 250 (e) to constitute
notice and demand for the payment of the first instalment; because it was a suffi ient return to form the basis
of an assessment, which, unc ,rthe law, must be based on
a return; and because it was t sufficient return to subject
taxpayers to the penalties irovided by § 3176 of the
Revised Statutes and § 253 f the Act, for failure to file
it on time.
These arguments ignore the differences in nature and
purpose between Form 1031T and the return required by

280 U. S.

the Act. The mere fact that. Form 1031T was a formal
document prescribed by the Commissioner and termed a
"return " does not identify it as the return required by
the Act. The word " return " is not a technical word of
art. It may be true that the filing of a return which is
defective or incomplete under § 239 is sufficient to start
the running of the period of limitation; and that the
filing of an amended return does not toll the period.'
But the defective or incomplete return purports to be a
specific statement of the items of income, deductions and
credits in compliance with § 239. And, to have that
effect, it must honestly and reasonably be intended as
such. There is not a pretense of such purpose with respect to Form 1031T. Nor is it the purpose of Form
1120 to supply or correct something omitted or misstated
in Form 1031T. The latter was neither defective nor incomplete. The. extension of time for the payment of the
first instalment was prevented, not because Form 1031T
was considered a return in compliance with the statute,
but because the Commissioner exacted payment as a
condition for the requested extension of time to file the
return. The penalties were to be imposed for the failure
to file, or the late filing, of the detailed return above described. And the penalties were avoided, not by the filing
of Form 1031T as a substantial compliance with the
requirement of a return, but, as expressly stated in that
form, by the extension of time to file which was granted
" in consideration of the filing of this tentative return
and the payment of not less than one-fourth of the estimated amount of the. tax, and for the reasons stated."
Obviously, without the payment of the first instalment

and the consequent grant of an extension of time, the
mere filing of Form 1031T would not have avoided the
penalties prescribed for the late filing of the return required by the Act." Nor would the penalties have been
avoided by the filing of that form, if the complete return
were not filed within the extended time.
The contention that because Form 1031T was sufficient
as a notice and demand under § 250 (e) it was a sufficient
return to start the period of limitation is equally unsound. That section did not prescribe the exclusive mode
for the notice and demand for payment of the first instalment. Any instrument containing the notice and
demand would be as efficacious for that purpose as the return required by the statute. Finally, the argument that
Form 1031T was a sufficient return to furnish the basis for
assessment lacks significance, whether or not. it is.
sound.8 The Commissioner is not confined to the taxpayer's return for the basis of his assessment. He may
secure additional information; and he may assess the tax
even if the taxpayer files no return. Rev. Stat. § 3176,
Attention is called to Article 407 of Internal Revenue Regulations
45, which provided that: "In lack of a prescribed form a statement
made by a taxpayer disclosing his gross income and the deductions
therefrom may. be accepted as a tentative return, and if filed within
The prescribed time, a return so made will relieve the taxpayer from
liability to penalties, provided that without unndcessary delay such
a tentative return is replaced by. a return made on.the proper form."
But obviously Form 1031T was not a tentative return within the
meaning of this Article. It did not even phrport to be a "statement
disclosing gross income and the deductions therefrom."
8 To sustain the argument that assessment could be. made on the
basis of Form 1031T, counsel cited only Matteawan v. Commissioner,
14 B. T. A. 789 and Lamborn v. Commissioner, 13 B. T. A. 177, 187.
But it is not clear that in either.of these cases, the assessment was in
fact made on the basis of that form. In both cases there were other
bases; and in both- cases the Board of Tax Appeals expressly refused
to comment on the propriety of assessment based on Form 1031T.
See Appeal of Matteawan Mfg. Co., 4 B. T.'A. 953, 956.

OCTOBER TERM, 1929.
Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S,

U. S. C. Tit. 26, § 97; Revenue Act 1918, § 250 (c). The
mere fact that, in the absence of any information, the
Commissioner might be compelled to assess the tax on
the basis of the taxpayer's estimate, does not transform
that simple estimate of the amount of the tax into the
detailed return of the items of gross income, deductions,
and credits required by the Act. Form 1031T was only
a formal substitute for the simple letter originally
planned, remitting payment and requesting an extension.
That it was called "Tentative Return" is of no significance. It was termed also "Estimate Of Corporation
Income And Profits Taxes And Request For Extension
Of Time For Filing Return."
It has been said that the Government is assuming an
inconsistent and unconscionable attitude. But there is
nothing inconsistent or unconscionable in its position. The
Commissioner did not represent that the date of filing Form
1031T would be treated as the beginning of the period of
limitation. And it is not clear that he had the power
to shorten the period prescribed by the statute. The Government has not treated Form 1031T for any purpose as
the return required by the Act. The tentative return was
confessedly a novel device. It imposed no hardship on
taxpayers. Indeed, it enabled them to save the interest
charge which otherwise would have attended an extension
of time to file the return and pay the first instalment.
Notice of the Commissioner's intention to assess deficiencies in stated amounts Was given to the corporations
much before March 15, 1925. The delay in the assessments past that date was due to negotiations with the
Commissioner whici resulted in the reduction of those
amounts to less than half in the one case and to about
one-sixth in the other. The corporations are in no position to complain of the Government's action.
Second. The claim that, even if the assessment was
timely, the collection was barred, depends upon the effect

FLORSHEIM BROS. CO. v. UNITED STATES.

465

Opinion of the Court.-

453

of the " Income and Profits Tax Waiver," and the applicability of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926. As
previously stated, both corporations and the Commissioner executed this. instrument pursuant to § 250 (d)
of the 1921 Act, prior to March 15, 1924, and consented
to the determination, assessment and collection of the
tax, " this waiver" to be in effect for one year after the
expiration of the statutory period of limitation. Under
the 1921 Act, § 250 (d), this period was five years after
the return was tiled. The Revenue Acts of 1924 and
1926 extended the period for collection to six years after
the date of assessment; June 2, 1924, c. 234, § 278 (d),
43 Stat. 253, 300; Feb. 26, 1926, c. 27, § 278 (d), 44 Stat.
9, 59. In both cases proceedings for collection of the tax
were begun more than six years after either the tentative
or the complete returns were filed, but less than six years
after the assessments were made. In the Florsheim cae,
collection was effected in 1925; in the Hood case, in 1926,
after the passage of the 1926 Act.
The' Government contends that the " Income and
Profits Tax Waivers" executed by the corporations were
waivers by them of the statutory period for another year;
that while these waivers were still in force and while
the corporations' liability was thus still alive, the Revenue Act of 1924 and 1926 were passed, increasing the
period for collection to six years after assessment; that
these Acts are applicable to the cases at bar; and that, since
the collections were made within six years after the assessments, they were timely made. The corporations insist
that the "Waivers" were not merely waivers extending
the statutory period, but were binding contracts which
limited the time in which the Commissioner could assess
and collect the taxes; and that no change in the law
made after the date of the contracts and enlarging the
time for collection can affect their rights. They urge
that the 1924 and 1926 Acts did not purport to extend the
81325°-30-30

Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

periods thus limited by contract; and that, if construed as
extending such periods, the provisions of these Acts are
unconstitutional.. They concede that, in the absence of
contract, a legislature may constitutionally lengthen or
shorten the period in which a: right may be enforced by
legal proceedings.
We are of opinion that the contention of the Government must prevail. The waivers executed by the parties
were not contracts binding the Commissioner not to make
the assessments and collections after the periods specified.
At the time when the waivers were executed, the Commissioner was without power under the statute to assess or
collect the taxes after the statutory period, as extended
by the waivers. A promise by the Commissioner not to
do what by the statute he was lrecluded from doing, would
have been of no significance. The waivers do not purport
to contain such a promise. Bank of Commerce v. Rose,
26 F. (2d) 365, 166; Greylock Mills v. Commissioner,31
F. (2d) 655, 657. And obviously, the Commissioner did
not undertake to limit the, power of Congress to extend
the period of limitations, as consideration for the waivers.
The instruments were nothing more than what they were
termed on their face-waivers; and that was all to which
the Commissioner was authorized to consent.
Stress is laid on the use of the words "agree" and "agreement" in the Acts and Regulations. But these are ordinary words having no technical significance. It is also
urged that, unless a contract was intended, 'there is no
reason why the consent of the Commissioner should have
been required. But an otherwise plain meaning should
not be distorted merely for the sake of finding a purpose
for this administrative requirement., If a reason must be
found, it exists in the general desirability of the requirement as an administrative matter. It serves to keep the
Commissioner in closer touch with the matters which he

is charged to administer. It avoids claims of improvident
execution of waivers and unauthorized exactions by subordinates of the Department for the purpose of curing
their own delinquencies. And it provides a formal procedure which is generally desirable for the Commissioner,
collectors, and subordinates in the Department. That
other means might have been devised for the same purpose is of no significance.
The question as to the applicability of the later Acts
may be briefly disposed of. Section 1100 of the Revenue
Act of 1924 repealed the 1921 Act. Section 277 (a) (2)
of the 1924 Act' expressly dealt with taxes due under
the Acts of 1918 and 1921; and it reenacted the five year
limitation with the express qualification, "Except as provided in section 278." Section 278 (c)" 0 reenacted the
provision as to extension of time by the consent of the
Commissioner and the taxpayer; and constituted the sole
statutory authority for the waiver of the period of limitation for taxes due under the 1918 and 1921 Acts. It
unquestionably applied to waivers thereafter to be executed; and no .reason appears why it did not equally
apply to waivers executed prior to the passage of the
Act. Section 278 (d) 1 prescribed the period of limitation for the collection of taxes applicable to all cases
enumerated in that section and § 277, which expressly
included taxes under the Act of 1918. The situations
intended to be excluded from the limitations prescribed
were carefully specified in § 278 (e)' 2 : (1) assessments
0 § 277 (a) (3) of the 1926 Act.
10 § 278 (c) of the 1926 Act.
U § 278 (d) of the 1926 Act.
12 § 278 (e) of the 1926 Act.
This' section eliminated the second
exception in § 278 (e) of the 1924 Act, stated in the text. The fact
that, in the Hood case, where collection was made after the enactment
of the 1926 Act, the assessment had been made previous to that
time, is, therefore, immaterial.

or. collections already barred before the passage of that
Act and (2) assessments made and proceedings begun
prior to that time. Neither of the cases at bar falls within
those exceptions. Since, in both cases, assessment and
collection were not barred on the enactment of the 1924
Act, and were made after that date, the section is applicable. Compare Russell v. United States, 278 U. S. 181.
It is urged that this construction of the Acts causes
discrimination against taxpayers who obligingly consented
to additional time for assessment and collection, and in
favor of those who obdurately refused such consent or
whose returns were not audited, prior to the bar of the
statute, for the purpose of assessing deficiencies. That
taxpayers whose returns led to no suspicion of inaccuracy
prior to the expiration of the statutory period are in a
preferable position is due, not to any unjust discrimination contained in the 1924 or 1926 Acts, but to the quality
of their returns and to propitious circumstances. For
the disobliging taxpayers, the Acts provided an alternative
remedy in the so-called jeopardy assessment and demand;
1924, § 274 (d), 43 Stat. 297; 1926, § 279, 44 Stat. 59. It is
urged also that the Government may not properly and
consistently accept the consent contained in the
"Waivers " and not be bound by the limitation. But the
limitation was only on the corporations' consent; and the
Government was bound thereby. The instruments contained nothing, however, which could restrict the Government's power to enlarge the statutory provisions as to
limitation. The timeliness of the collection is based not
upon the waivers, but upon the statutes.
