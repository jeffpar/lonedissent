1. A judgment of the Appellate Court of Illinois, which, under
Cahill's Rev. Stats. Ill., 1927, c. 110, ยง 121, is final unless the
judges of that court grant a certificate of importance and an appeal

application for review, is affirmed when the Supreme Court refuses
such an application and is then final for purposes ' of review in
this Court, although no application for certificate of importance

3. A railway employee, having occasion in the course of his duty to

warning, other cars were shunted forcibly against them. It was
the custom of the railway company to give warning when such
shunting was to be done, but only to persons, other than employees, engaged in unloading the standing cars; and there was no
custom or duty of the kind in respect of employees engaged in
work on or about the tracks. There was nothing to show that.
the employees engaged in the switching operation knew, or had
reason to believe, that this employee was .in any position of danger. Held that the failure to give warning, though he r-lied upon
it, was not a breach of duty owed to him, and that he had no cause
of action. P. 106.

SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Section 121, c. 110, Cahill's Revised Statutes of Illinois,
1927, provides that, except in cases where an appeal or
writ of error will lie under the Constitution from the
state appellate courts to the supreme court, the judgments
of the former shall be final, except (1) in certain cases
where, in the opinion of the appellate court judges, ques-

tions of importance are involved, such judges may grant
appeals to the supreme court on petition, in which case
the grounds for granting such appeals shall be certified,
and (2) the supreme. court may require such cases made
final in the appellate courts to be certified for review and
determination with the same effect as though carried up
by appeal or writ of error. Application was made to the
state supreme court for a writ to review the judgment of
the appellate court in this case and was denied. The
jurisdiction of-this Court in granting the petition for a
writ of certiorari is now attacked on the ground that petitioner did not exhaust its remedies under state law, because it failed also to apply to the appellate court for a
certificate of importance and an appeal as provided in
subdivision (1) above. In Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M.
R. Co.v. Rock, 279 U. S. 410, we had under eonsideration
the same question and held that the denial of an application for certiorari by the state supreme court was in effect
an affirmance of the judgment, and that it would be unreasonable to require an application to the appellate court
for a certificate of importance and appeal when the supreme court had thus approved the judgment. This
Court, therefore, has jurisdiction; and we proceed to consider the merits.
The respondent brought an action in the superior court
of Cook County to recover damages for a personal injury
suffered while engaged as an employee of petitioner in
interstate commerce. That court at the conclusion of the
ex'idence denied a motion for a directed verdict in favor
of petitioner. Upon a verdict of the jury, judgment was
rendered for respondent, which the appellate court, on
appeal, affirmed. 249 Ill. App. 446.
Petitioner seeks to reverse the judgment of the appellate court on the ground, among others, that there was
no proof of negligence and the motion for a directed verdict should have been sustained.

C. & 0.- R. CO. v. MIHAS.
102

Opinion of the Court.

Mihas was employed by the railway company to care
for switch lights and lamps along the right of way, and
had been thus employed for about four years prior to the
injury. He had lived all that time near the switch tracks
in the yards at Peru, Indiana. He was thoroughly familiar with the switching operations and with the fact that
they were carried on every day, usually between the hours
of six and seven o'clock in the morning. In doing his work
he used a small speeder car, which was kept on the opposite
side of the tracks from where he lived; and it was necessary for him to cross these tracks to get the car. About
ten minutes before seven o'clock on the morning of the
accident, as he came from his house, he saw two men with
a truck going away from a coal car which they had been
unloading. He testified that he looked to one side and
the other, but did not see or hear any train or cars approaching. Proceeding directly from his house, on his
way across the tracks to get the speeder car, he attempted
to climb over a coal car standing with a number of others
on a switch track. While in the act of doing so, a string
of nine cars'was forcibly propelled by means of a flying
switch against the standing cars with such violence that
Mihas was thrown between two cars and severely injured.
The cars being switched moved at the rate of four or five
miles per hour, which was not an unusual speed for that
kind of an operation. Those engaged in the movement
had no knowledge of Mihas' position or of his movements. One of the standing cars contained coal, and
shortly prior to the switching operation the two men seen
by Mihas had been engaged in unloading the coal into a
truck, but at the time of the impact they had driven off
and were some distance away from the standing cars.
There was evidence to the effect that it was customary
for train men personally to notify persons engaged in unloading cars before making a switching operation likely
to affect them; but that such notic.e was exclusively for

280 U. S.

men so engaged. Mihas testified that he knew of this
practice. He heard no notice given to the men on the
occasion in question; but whether he crossed the cars relying upon that fact the testimony does not 'make clear,
although it is assumed in the briefs and arguments and
we assume that he did. He could have crossed in a
roundabout way without climbing over the cars, and his
selection of the latter method was for his own convenience.
Mihas testified that his foreman knew about his having
to cross the tracks and had never told him not to cross
between the cars; but there is no evidence that the foreman or any agent or employee of the company had knowledge that Mihas ever crossed by climbing over standing
cars.
The negligence complained of is that in making the
flying switch the standing cars were struck with great and
unnecessary force; that it was the established custom of
the railway company to give due notice and warning to
all persons in or about such cars before moving or shunting other cars against the standing cars; and that such
notice or warning was not given upon the occasion in
question. The evidence, however, is that the notification
or warning was exclusively for persons, not employees,
engaged in unloading cars. There was no custom or duty
of that kind ii respect of employees engaged on or about
the tracks. If there was a violation of duty, therefore,
on the part of the railway company, it was not of a duty
owing to Mihas; and the rule is well established that it
is not sufficient for a complainant to show that he has
been injured by the failure of another to perform a duty
or obligation unless that duty or obligation was one owing
to the complainant. In Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v.
Nixon, 271 U. S. 218, the facts were that a section foreman
whose employment obliged him to go over and examine
the track was on a tour of inspection. For that purpose

C. & 0. R. CO. v. MIHAS.

Opinion of the Court.

he used a velocipede fitted to the rails. He was overtaken
by a train and killed. The negligence charged was that
the engineer and fireman of the train were not on the
lookout; and the proof was to that effect. It was held
that that duty was one which the railroad company might
owe to others but not toward the class of employees to
which the deceased belonged; and a recovery for his death
was reversed. In O'Donnell v. Providence & Worcester
R. Co., 6 R. I. 211, it was held that a statute giving a
right of action to one injured by the neglect of the railroad company to ring the locomotive bell before making
a highway crossing was designed exclusively for the benefit of persons crossing the highway, and one injured
while walking along the track not at a crossing could not
recover under the statute. The court said (p. 214):
"If the defendants have violated any duty owing from
them to the plaintiff, and by means or in consequence of
that violation the plaintiff has suffered injury, he has a
right to compensation and damages at the hands of the
defendants for such injury. In the language of the books,
an action lies against him who neglects to do that which
by law he ought to do, (1 Vent. 265; L Salk. 335,) and
that, whether the duty be one existing at common law,
or be one imposed by statute. In order, however, to a
recovery, it is not sufficient that some duty or obligation
should have been neglected by the defendants, but it
must have been a neglect of some duty or obligation to
him who claims damages for the neglect. In 1.Comyns's
Digest, Action upon Statute, F, it is said, 'In every case
where a statute enacts or prohibits a thing for the benefit
of a person, he shall have a remedy upon the same statute
for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of the wrong done to him contrary to said law,'
confining the remedy to such things as are enacted for
the benefit of the person suing."

Swann's Admx., 160 Ky. 458, 469.
There is nothing in the record to show that employees
engaged in the switching operation knew or had reason
to believe that Mihas was in any position of danger. In
the absence of such knowledge or ground for belief, they
were not required to warn him of the impending switching
operation or take other steps to protect him. Toledo,

WICK v. CHELAN ELECTRIC COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF WASHINGTON.

No. 29.

Argued November 1, 1929.-Decided November 25, 1929.,

1. Upon review of a decision of a state supreme court sustaining a
โข service by publication on-a non-resident land-owner in a condemnation case as conformable to a state statute, and rejecting the
land-owner's contention that the period of time between service
and the return day was too brief to satisfy the demands of due
process under the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court accepts as
binding upon it the state court's construction of the statute with
respect to the time as of which service is complete and as to the
manner of fixing the return day. P. 110.
2. Eighteen days between service by publication and the return
day held sufficient time under the due process clause, as applied to
a non-resident defendafit in a suit to condemn land. Id.
3. Description of property in petition in condemnation proceedings
held adequate under the due process clause. P. 1U1.
