is to apply for a rehearing before him or to institute new
proceedings. He has the power and the duty to modify
his order, if new evidence warrants the change. Compare Interstate Commerce Conmission v. Union Pacific
R. R. Co., 222 U. S. 541, 550. A rate order is not res
judicata. Every rate order made may be superseded by
another.
Sixth. There is also a contention that the rates prescribed are not merely unsupported by the evidence, but
are confiscatory; and that the order is therefore void.
Whether the additional evidence before the master was
admissible on the issue of confiscation presents a serious
question of practice which was not argued by counsel.
The lower court held the additional evidence admissible,
and, after considering it, reached the conclusion that the
charges prescribed are not unreasonably low or confiscatory. This conclusion of the lower court conforms, in
our opinion, to the evidence, whether the examination
be confined to that evidence which was received by the
Secretary or be extended to include the additional evidence introduced before the master and the court. The
question of the admissibility of the additional evidence
on the issue of confiscation may, therefore, be passed, and
it is passed, without decision.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 67. Argued January 8, 1930.-Decided February 24, 1930.
A corporation, which kept its accounts, and made its income tax

returns, on the accrual basis, sought to deduct, under § 234 (a)
of the Revenue Act of 1918, as a loss sustained in 1919, the amount

of a judgment which it suffered in 1922 and paid in 1923. The
judgment was founded on a breach of contract committed by the
taxpayer in 1919, in discharging a sales manager who, by the terms
of the contract, was to be emp'loyed for eighteen years more and
be compensated by commissions on sales. Though denying and
contesting its liability, the taxpayer had set up on its books in 1919
a reserve equal to the commissions for that year, and had increased
it in 1920, on the same basis; and after the rendition of the judgment, it had adjusted the reserve to the amount of the recovery.

Held:
1. Since the general requirement of the statute that losses be
deducted in the years in which they are sustained calls for a
practical, and not a legal, test, and since the direction, § 212 (b),
that net income be computed according to the method of accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer is expressly limiteil to
cases where the Commissioner believes that the accounts clearly
reflect the net income, the administrative interpretation and practice in these regards should not be disturbed by the courts unless
clearly unlawful. P. 449.
2. Since it could not be said that the loss actually paid by the
taxpayer in 1923 was, as a matter of law or undeniable fact, sustained in the year 1919, and since the taxpayer did not in that
year accrue an estimated amount of the loss on its books, rejection
of the deduction for that year should be sustained. Pp. 450-452.
3. Mere reserves to cover contingent liabilities are not allowable
as deductions. P. 452.

torney, Bureau of Internal Revenue, were on the briefs,
for petitioner.
Mr. Clark H. Hebner for the respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
When the income-tax return for 1919, of the American Code Company, Inc., was being audited in 1925; the
Company filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a claim for a refund based upon its failure to deduct
from its 1919 gross income the amount for which judgment was recovered against it in 1922, on a contested
liability for a breach of contract in 1919. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue rejected the claim and asserted a deficiency. His ruling was sustained by the
Board of Tax Appeals. 10 B. T. A. 476. Its decision
was reversed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 30 F. (2d) 222. We
granted a writ of certiorari. 279 U. S. 832.
The facts on which the claim for the refund is based
are as follows: The Company agreed to employ Farquhar
as sales manager for eighteen- years from January 3, 1919,
the compensation to be a commission based on sales. In
May, 1919; it discharged him,, for alleged cause. In July,
1919, Farquhar brought suitagainst it in the Supreme
Court of New York for wrongful discharge, claiming
$100,000 damages. Affirmative defenses were interposed
and liability was contested. In October, 1919, the Company notified the Commissioner, of the suit and asked
leave to deduct in its income-tax return an amount equal
to the commissions for 1919 computed on the contract
basis. Permission was refused; but the Company set up
on its books, at the close of the year, a reserve equal to

the amount of such commissions, $14,764.79. At the
close of 1920, the amount in this reserve was increased
by $32,994.09, computed on the same basis. In 1922,
after a jury trial, judgment for $21,019.19 was entered in
the trial court and, on appeal by the Company, was
affirmed by the Appellate Division. The Company then
prosecuted a further appeal to the Court of Appeals. In
1923 the judgment was affirmed by that court and paid by
the Company. The judgment having been rendered by
the trial court early in 1922 before the books were closed
for 1921, the reserve set up was adjusted as of the close of
1921, to the amount of the recovery, $21,019.19. That
sum is claimed as the deduction for 1919.
The Company kept its books and made its income-tax
returns on the accrual basis. The Revenue Act of 1918,
Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, § 234 (a) (4), 40 Stat. 1057
1077-8, provides that in computing net income "losses
sustained during the taxable year and not compensated
for by insurance or otherwise " shall be allowed as deductions. Section 212 (b) provides that the net income shall
be computed "in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of such taxpayer," unless the method employed does not clearly reflect the net income. And Article 111 of Regulations No.
45, (1920 ed.), of the Bureau of Internal Revenue provides
that a "person making returns on an accrual basis has
the right to deduct all authorized allowances, whether paid
in cash or set up as a liability. .. ."
The Company's argument, sustained by the Court of
Appeals, is that, since the breach of the contract occurred
in 1919, all the facts which gave rise to the liability were
fixed in that year; that damages must be assessed as of
the date of the breach; that the loss therefore occurred
in that year; and that it is immaterial that the amount
of the damages was not determined or paid until later.

LUCAS v. AMERICAN CODE CO.
445

Opinion of the Court.

Attention is specifically called to the provision in Article
111, which declares that if after naking a return " a
taxpayer first ascertains the amount of a loss sustained
during a prior taxable year which has not been deducted
from gross income, he may render an amended return
for such preceding taxable year, including such amount
of loss in the deductions from gross income, and may
file a claim for refund of the excess tax paid by reason of
the failure to deduct such loss in the original return.."
Generally speaking, the income-tax law is concerned
only with realized losses, as with realized gains. Weiss v.
Wiener, 279 U. S.333, 335. Exception is made however,
in the case of losses which are so reasonably certain in
fact and ascertainable in amount as to justify their deduction, in certain circumstances, before they are absolutely
realized. As respects lossesoccasioned by the taxpayer's
breach of contract, no definite legal test is provided by
the statute for the determination of the year in which
the loss is to be deducted. The general requirement that
losses be deducted in the year in which they are sustained
calls for a practical, not a legal test. And the direction
that net income be computed according to the method of
accounting regularly employed by the taxpayer is expressly limited to cases where the Comnmissioner believes
that the accounts clearly reflect the net income. Much
latitude for discretion is thus given to the administrative
board charged with the duty of enforcing the Act. Its
interpretation of the statute and the practice adopted by
it should not be interfered with unless clearly unlawful.
Article 111 of Regulations No. 45, interpreting the
provisions as to deductions for losses, states: "Any
amount paid pursuant to a judgment or otherwise on
account of damages for personal injuries, patent infringement or otherwise, is deductible from gross income when
the claim is put in judgment or paid.

Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

Board of Tax Appeals has held, in a series of well-reasoned
opinions, that a loss occasioned by the taxpayer's breach
of contract is not deductible in the year of the breach,
except under the special circumstances where, within the
tax year, there is a definite admission of liabilty, negotiations for settlement are begun. and a.reasonable estimate
of the amount of the loss is accrued on the books.'
It may be assumed that, since the Company kept its
books on the accrual basis, the mere fact that the exact
amount of the liability had not been definitely fixed in
1919 would not prevent the deduction, as a loss of that
year, of the amount later paid. But here there are other
obstacles. Obviously, 'the mere refusal to perform a 6ontract does not justify the deduction, as a loss, of the' anticipated damages. For, even an unquestionable breach
does not result in loss if the injured party forgives or
refrains from prosecuting his claim. And, when liability
is contested, the institution of a. suit does not, of itself,
create certainty of loss. In the few cases in which the

Opinion of the Court.

Board of Tax Appeals has allowed a deduction in the year
of the breach, the contracts, involving the purchase and
sale of goods., were performable in a comparatively short
period; the approximate amount of the damages*was reasonably predictable; negotiations for settlement had been
commenced within the year and were completed soon
after its close; an( the taxpayers had accrued on their
books, at the end of the year, a liability reasonably
estimated to equal the amount of the damages.
In the case at bar, the contract had nearly eighteen
more years to run, at the time of his breach. Liability
for the breach was denied and strenuously contested, the
litigation being carried to the highest court of the State.
The amount of the damages, if any, was wholly unpredictable. While the facts determining liability had occurred
in the year of the breach, the amount to be recovered, if
there was legal liability, depended in large part on the
course of future events. Farquhar was under a duty to
mitigate damages. He might have procured new employment which would have reduced his recovery to a nominal
amount. Or, recovery might have been reduced or defeated by his death. Finally, the Company (lid not accrue on its books, within the tax year, a liability in the
estimated amount of the loss. The reserve set up had no
relation to the apprehended total loss. It constituted
simply the amount of the commissions which would have
2 Thus, in AppeA of Producers Fuel Co., note I supra, there were
two contracts for the purchase, respectively, of 15,700 and 20,000 tons
of coal in equal monthly instalments between May 1920 and March
1921 and between May 1920 and May 1921. Both contracts were
broken in December 1920 and offers of settlement were immediately
made. Reserves of 87,500 and S30,000 were set up in 1920. The
claims were settled in January 1921 for 85,500 and $29,792.40. Similar situations were involved in Raleigh Smokeless Fuel Co. v. Commissioner and Fraser Brick Co. v, Commissioner, ibid,

been payable in that year if Farquhar had remained in
the Company's employ. That the Company did not intend the reserve to be an accrual of the total estimated
loss is clearly indicated by the fact that, in 1920, it charged
to the reserve, to cover the commissions which would
have been payable in 1920, an additional amount, more
than double that charged in 1919.
The prudent business man often sets up reserves
to
cover contingent liabilities. But they are not allowable
as deductions.' The reserve set up by the Company was
of that character. It cannot be said that the loss actually paid by the Company in 1923 was, as a matter of
law or of undeniable fact, sustained in 1919. Nordid
the Company so regard it. The case at bar is unlike
United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422. There, the
liability for the munitions tax at a fixed rate on the business done in 1916 had confessedly accrued in that year
and was a charge on the business of that year, although
the exact amount due may not have been then ascertainable and the tax was not payable until 1917. It is also
unlike American National Co. v. United States, 274 U. S.
99. There, the bonus contract provided definitely for the
payment of a fixed amount. It was debitum in praesenti,
solvendum in futuro. The case at bar is in principle more
like Lewellyn v. Electric Reduction Co., 275 U. S. 243.
