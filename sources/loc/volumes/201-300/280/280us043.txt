lever, and one alone of these changes cannot be substituted in the Winters and Crampton structure without the
other, so as to make it operative, is plainly insufficient to
avoid the infringement.
Nor is the infringement avoided, under the controlling
weight of the undisputed facts, by any presumptive validity that may attach to the Schrader patent by reason
of its issuance after the Winters and Crampton patent.

JUSTICE

TAFT delivered the opinion of the

The judgment of the Court of Claims, now under consideration, was given on a claim against the United States
for alleged patent infringement, and was-entered on February 4, 1929. A petition for certiorari seeking review in
this Court was filed May 1, 1929, and was denied on
October 14, 1929. The Government contends that both
methods of review, either by appeal or certiorari, in this
Court are now without avail.
The claim was referred by the Senate to the Court of
Claims for an advisory finding and report of the material
facts. A hearing was had in the Court of Claims and it
reported its findings on the questions of fact., Thereafter
the Court of Claims re-heard the case under a special
Jurisdictional Act of Congress approved March 3, 1927,
(44 Stat. c. 40S, Part 3, p. 1807,) which read as follows:
"That the findings of fact made by the Court of Claims
in the case of Arthur E. Colgate, administrator of the
estate of Clinton G. Colgate, deceased, against the United
States, Congressional, Numbered 6063, Senate Document
Numbered 703, Sixty-fourth Congress, second session, be,
and they are hereby, referred back to the Court of Claims
with jurisdiction to render such judgment as the findings
of fact heretofore found and the law require: Provided,
That either party hereto may .appeal to the Supreme
Court of the United States upon or from any conclusion
of law or judgment, from which appeals now lie in other
cases, at any time within ninety days after the rendition
of judgment: Provided further, That the amount of any

such judgment shall not exceed the sum of $50,000: And
provided further, That such notice hereof shall be given
to the Attorney General of the United States as may be
provided by ordors of said court, and it shall be the duty
of the- Attorney General to cause one of his assistants to
appear and defend for the United States."
Judgment for the Government in the re-heard case was
given by the Court of Claims on February 4, 1929, based
on a letter to the Commissioner of Patents under date of
January 15, 1851, from Simpson, the then owner, specifically abandoning the application for the patent.
On April 23, 1929, Arthur Colgate, as administrator of
Clinton Colgate, in pursuance of the Special Act, filed an
applicaiion in the Court of Claims for the allowance of
an appeal to this Court from the adverse judgment, and
appeal was allowed by the Court of Claims on April 26,
1929. The appeal was docketed in this Court May 1,
1929, and on the same day a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed on the record in the appeal case. The petition for certiorari, as already said, was denied by us October 14th last. The case is now before us for consideration of the question of our jurisdiction upon the appeal.
We think the proper construction to be put upon this
Special Act is that the review provided for was a petition
for certiorari. One of the chief purposes of the General
Act of February 13, 1925, ch. 229, 43 Stat. 936, was to
abolish appeals from the Court of Claims to this Court
and substitute therefor applications for writs of certiorari.
The language of the Special Act is that " either party
hereto may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United
States upon or from any conclusion of law or judgment
from which appeals now lie in other cases." At the time
of the passage of that Act, no appeals generally "lay in
other cases" from the Court of Claims to this Court, and
do not now. It was evidently intended by the Act of
1925 to make the method of review by this Court of judg-

It was intended

by the Act of 1925 to give this Court an opportunity to
determine in advance whether the case was one worthy
of review here. To hold that the case may come here
only by certiorari is to make it-conform to the genieral
purpose of the Act of February 13, 1925, in enlarging the
use of certiorari as a method of review in this Court. To
describe appeals as from judgments "from which appeAs
now lie in other cases" is a mistake, unless one gives to
the meaning of the word "appeals" something more than
a mere technical meaning. If what was intended was
an appeal in its technical significance as distinguished
from certiorari, different words should have been used to
indicate it. Therefore the Special Act must be construed
to require that the review intended was the usual method
of review at the date of the Special Act, which is and was
by application for a writ of certiorari.
The case of Sisseton and Wahpeton Band of Sioux Indians v. United States, 277 U. S. 424, does not control the
present case. That case had reference to another special
act, granting the appellants one year from tfhe date of the
Act within which to appeal, and it was held to confer the
right of appeal as distinguished from the right to petition
for certiorari.. That special act was approved March 4,
1927, (c. 522, 44 Stat., Part 3, p. 1847,) and its purpose
was to revive a right to appeal to this Court given to the
ame appellants by the Act of April 11, 1916, (39 Stat. 47,
c. 63,) but of which appellants had failed to avail themselves within the time limited therefor. Since Congress,
by the 1927 Act, was merely extending the period for the
exercise of a right conferred in 1916, the term "appeal,"
contained in the statute, was naturally construed with
reference to its meaning at the time the right to it was
originally granted. That was granted nearly nine years
before the Act of February 13, 1925, changed the mode of

Opinion of the Court.

appellate review of judgments of the Court of Claims from
a technical "appeal" to a petition for writ of certiorari.
These provisions with respect to special review of casesfrom the Court of Claims should be carefully construed.
They are generally embodied in exceptional legislation
considered by other committees than the judiciary committees, not especially advised as to the importance of
uniformity in respect to such exceptions. It should therefore, be clear, if a departure from the ordinary metfrods of
limitation of review is intended by Congress, that the
language should leave no doubt about it.
The history of the legislation and the language used
show that the reference to appeals in the Special Act now
before us finds its counterpart in other Acts havring the
same purpose. The language is that "either party hereto
may appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States
upon or from any conclusion of law or judgment from
which appeals now lie in other cases." Acts of this kind,
although speaking of "appeals," show what is intended
by the phrase, "as in other cases." The list of the later
Acts in legislation 6T this kind, after the passage of the
Act of February 13, 1925, is as follows:

other cases," and the whole course of the legislation indicates a desire that the same appellate review should be
given as in other cases. We think that this customary
Ianguage requires the uniform use of the writ of certiorari
in order to secure that which a certiorari gives-a preliminary examination of proceedings by this Court before review. Unless a special reason in the Act providing for
appellate review indicates that the review is to be by
technical appeal rather than by the ordinary method of
certiorari, the latter method is the right one. This must
lead to the dismissal of the present appeal.
