ment against any of the defendants in these cases would
come out of the United States. It is the real party affected in all of these actions. § 8, Suits in Admiralty
Act; 46 U. S. C., § 748. Cf. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185
U. S. 373, 387.
The analysis of the Act and the reasons on which rests
our decision in Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Bros.
apply here. Putting the United States and the Fleet Corporation on the same footing and providing remedies to
be exclusive in admiralty would not serve substantially
to establish uniformity if suits under the Tucker Act and
in the Court of Claims be allowed against the United
States and actions at law in state and federal courts be
permitted against the Fleet Corporation or other agents
for enforcement of the maritime causes of action covered
by the Act. Such a failure of purpose on the part of the
Congress is not readily to be inferred. We conclude that
the remedies given by the Act are exclusive in all cases
where a libel might be filed under it. As shown above,
§ 2 authorizes a libel in personam against the United
States or against the Fleet Corporation in each of these
cases. It follows that on disclosure-whether by pleading
or proof-of the facts aforesaid, the District Court should
have dismissed each case for lack of jurisdiction.
Judgments in Nos. 5, 32 and 56 reversed and
causes remanded with directions to dismiss.

1, 1913, the basis shall be its cost, the latter Act declaring also
that in case of "property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, the basis shall be the fair market price or value of such
property at the time of such acquisition," the basis of calculation
in the case of stocks acquired by the taxpayer as a residuary
legatee ,nd sold by him, is not their value at the date of the
decree of (listribution, but their value at the date of the testator's
death. P. 333.
2. The right of a residuary legatee to have his share of the residue
after administration, vests immediately upon the testator's death.
The decree of distribution confers no new right; it merely identifies the property remaining, evidences the right of possession in
the legatee, and requires its delivery by the executor or administrator. The legal title so given relates back to the date of the
death. P. 334.
3. The practical interpretation of an ambiguous or doubtful statute
that has been acted upon by officials charged with its administration will not be disturbed except for weighty reasons. P. 336.
4. Substantial renactment in later Acts of a provision theretofore
construed in regulations of the department charged with its administration, is persuasive evidence of legislative approval of the
regulations. P. 337.
5. In § 113 (a) (5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, which defines the
basis of calculating gain or loss in respect of sales of property
acquired by devise, bequest or intestacy, the language, deliberately
selected, so differs from that used in the earlier Acts as to indicate an intention to change the law. There is no support for the
suggestion that it expressed the meaning, or was intended to govern or affect the construction, of the earlier Acts. P. 337.

CERTIORARI,

Messrs. John W., Davis and J. Sawyer Fitch,with whom
Messrs. A. Broomfield and Charles Wright, Jr., were on

the brief, for petitioner.
The only basis specifically mentioned in the 1918 Actfor property acquired after March 1, 1913, is cost, and

BREWSTER v. GAGE.
327

Argument for Petitioner.

in a case of this kind there is no cost in the literal sense
of the word. The additional provision found in the 1921
Act, namely, § 202 (a) (3), is new and serves to make the
statute clearer and more definite by specifying that the
basic value of property acquired by bequest is its value
when acquired. It can hardly be doubted that, whatever may be the conclusion reached under the 1921 Act,
it must rationally be the proper conclusion to be reached
under the 1918 Act, and it is not apprehended that the
Treasury Department is of a different mind.
The narrow question to be answered is: When were
the stocks which Brewster sold in 1920, 1921, and 1922
"acquired " by him within the intendment of the statutes
here involved?
The "property" to which § 202 (a) (3) refers is the
specific property sold by the residuary legatee. The time
of " acquisition " of " such property" was the date of
the order of distribution, and is to be distinguished from
the acquisition of the mere right to a proper administration of the estate which vested at death. Wulzen v. Board
of Supervisors, 101 Cal. 15; Ex parte Okahara, 191 Cal.

McGee v. Commissioner, 13 B. T. A. 1181.
The long settled common law rule, which has never
.been changed by any statute or decision affecting this
case, is that upon a testator's death, title to personal property not specifically bequeathed, together with the possession, right to collect income therefrom and power to
sell, passes to the executor or administrator and not to
the residuary legatees, but indeed to the exclusion of
such legatees. United States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106;
Williams v. Cobb, 242 U. S. 307; Petersen v. Chemical

177 Wis. 548; Schouler on Wills, 6th ed., § 2061; Alexander, Commentaries on Wills, Vol. 3, § 1461.
It may be freely conceded that Brewster acquired something at the date of death, for at that time he acquired
a right to an honest administration of the estate and a
vested right to participate eventually in the residuum if
there should be any. This right is in itself property, and
if he should sell it, his gain or loss would be based upon
the value of such right at the time he acquired it, the date
of death. But this right is not the "property," the stocks,
which were distributed to him and which he sold in 1920,
1921, and 1922.
To hold that the property sold was acquired at the date
of the testator's death would result in increasing or decreasing a taxpayer's income on account of changes in
value of property before it is subject to the disposition
and control of such taxpayer. This should not be done
in the absence of clearly expressed congressional intent.
The legislative history of the statutes in question fully
supports the petitioner's construction.
The broad definition of gross income found in the first
income tax statute, the Revenue Act of 1913, has not
been changed in any respect here significant in the numerous revenue acts enacted to this date. In each of
the Acts there has been excluded from gross income and
exempted from the income tax, " the value of property
acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent." The only
change whatsoever occurred in the 1926 Act, when the
word "descent" was changed to "inheritance" and this
change was retained in the. 1928 Act. It is without
significance.
In all of the revenue acts, except that of 1913, in
which no specific provision is found, the general rule as
to basis has been that the basis for determining gain or

BREWSTER v. GAGE.
327

Argument for Petitioner.

loss from the sale of property is the cost of such property
if it was acquired after March 1, 1913, and the value of
such property at March 1, 1913, if it was acquired prior
to that date.
In the 1921 Act, subparagraph (3) of § 202 (a) was
added. This was for the purposes both of clarifying and
harmonizing the "basis provisions with § 213, which excludes "the value of property acquired by . . bequest . . ." from taxation as income. This provision was retained and reenacted in, the 1924 and 1926
Acts. If Congress intended to adopt any such consfruction as the Department here urges, it would certainly
have employed the obvious means of doing so by providing that the basis shall be the value at the date of death.
Furthermore, when the section was reenacted in 1926,
the Board of Tax Appeals had decided the Matthieson
case, supra, in 1925 holding that the basis is the value
at the date of distribution. By the time the 1928 Act
was passed, the Board, in the Foster case, had reiterated
its position, the Court of Claims, in the Matthieson.case,
had followed the Board, and the District Court had decided this case, all contrary to the construction now asked
by the Department. And when Congress came to reenact
the provisions here under consideration, it spelled out its
intention in a fashion that would leave no room whatsoever for doubt. This provision appears as § 113 (a) (5)
of the Revenue Act of 1928.
If, as the Department contended below, petitioner's
construction results in the escape from tax of income intended to be taxed, then it is impossible to explain why
Congress, in the 1928 Act, opened a way of escape, contrary to its consistent policy of closing all ways of escape.
The rational explanation is that Congress never intended
to tax this enhancement or to allow losses measured by
corresponding declines and that the 1928 Act merely provides more definitely that which it had always intended

but as to which doubt had arisen by reason of the conflicting views of the Department on the one hand and
the Board of Tax Appeals, the Court of Claims, and-the
District Court in this case, on the other hand.
Section 113 (a) (5) of the 1928 Act deals with precisely the same subject-matter as § 202 (a) (3) of the
1921 Act, here in'controversy, and the identical provisions of the 1924 and 1926 Acts. Where, from a subsequent statute in pari materia, it may be ascertained what
meaning the law makers attached to the words of a former statute, the, subsequent statute will govern the construction of the earlier statute. United States v. Freeman,
3 How. 556; Alexander v. Alexandria, 5 Cranch 1; United
States v. Coulby, 251 Fed. 982; affirmed, 258 Fed. 27;
Joy FloralCo. v..Commissioner, 29 F. (2d) 865.
The departmental construction is entitled to no weight
in construing the statutes here involved. There has been
no long continued or consistent departmental construction; in fact, there was no published departmental regulation or ruling prior to the enactment of the 1926 Act,
placing any construction on § 202 (a) (3) of the 1921
Act.,
The decision below is not sound; and its construction
of the statute leads to inconsistencies and confusion that
do not arise under the proper construction.

were distributed to the petitioner as one of the residuary
legatees. He sold some of them in 1920, 1921 and 1922.
For his income tax returns, he computed profit or loss
on each sale by comparing the selling price of the stock
with its value at the date of the decree of distribution and
paid the amounts so determined. Butthe Commissioner
of Internal Revenue held that the values of the stock at
the date of testator's death should be taken for the calculation of income, and on that basis assessed for each year
an additional tax which petitioner paid under protest.
He brought this action in the district court for the western district of New York to recover the amounts so exacted. The court gave judgment for him. 25 F. (2d) 915.
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 30 F. (2d) 604.
The taxes for 1920 are governed by the Revenue Act
of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1060, 1065, and those for 1921 and
1922 by the Act of 1921, 42 Stat. 227, 229, 237. As defined in these laws, gross income includes gains derived
from sales of property but does not include the value of
property acquired by bequest, devise or descent. § 213.
Section 202(a) in each Act provides that for the purpose
of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the
sale of property "acquired" on or after March 1, 1913,
the basis shall be its cost. This provision is made more
definite in the Act of 1921 by subdivision (3). It provides that, in case of " property, acquired by bequest,
devise, or inheritance, the basis shall be the fair market
price or value of such property at the time of such acquisition." It is not suggested by either party that this provision changed the law or that the basis for computing
the tax for 1920 under the earlier Act is not the same as
that applicable for 1921 and 1922 under the later Act. It
is necessary to construe the word "acquired " and the
phrase "at the time of such acquisition' to determine
whether the value of the stock at the time of testator's

death or its value on the date of the decree should be used
in the calculation.
Upon the death: of the owner, title to his real estate
passes to his heirs or devisees. A different rule applies to
personal property. Title to it does not vest at once in
heirs or legatees. United States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106,
112. But immediately 'upon the death of the owner
there vests in each of them the right to his distributive
share of so much as shall remain after proper administration and the right to have it delivered upon entry of the
decree of distribution. Sanders v. Soutter, 136 N. Y. 97.
Vail v. Vail, 49 Ccnn. 52. Cook v. McDowell, 52 N. J.
Eq. 351. Upon acceptance of the trust there vests in the
administrators or executors, as of the date of the death,
title to all personal property belonging to the estate; it
is taken, not for themselves, but in the right of others for
the proper, administration of the estate and for distribu'tion of the residue. The decree 'of distribution 'confers no
new right; it merely identifies the property remaining,

evidences right of possession in the heirs or legatees and
requires the administrators or executors to deliver it to
them. The legal title so given relates back to the date
of the death. Foster v. Fifield, 20 Pick. 67, 70. Wager v.

Petitioner's right later to have his share of the residue
vested' immediately upon testator's death. At that time
petitioner became enriched by its worth which was directly related to and would increase or decline correspondingly with the value of the property. And, notwithstanding the postponement of transfer of the legal title to him,
Congress unquestionably had power, and reasonably
might fix value at the time title passed from the decedent as
the basis for determining gain or loss upon sale of the right
.or of the property before or'after the decree of distribution.
And we think that in substance it would not be incon-

BREWSTER v. GAGE.
327

Opinion of the Court.

sistent with the rules of law governing the descent and distribution of real and personal property of decedents to
construe the words in question to mean the date of death.
Undoubtedly the basis for the ascertainment of gain
or loss on the sale of real estate by an heir or devisee is
its value at the time of decedent's death. That is "the
time of such acquisition." The decree of distribution
necessarily is later than, and has no definite relation to,
the time when the real estate passes. And generally
specific bequests are handed over to the legatees soon after
the death of the testator and 'such property may be and
often is sold by them prior to the entry of the decree for
final distribution. In such cases gains or losses are to be
calculated under these Acts on value at the time of death.
No other basis is or reasonably could be suggested.
There is nothing in either of the Acts or in their legislative history to indicate a purpose to establish two bases(1) value of real estate and specific bequests at time
of death and (2) value of other property at date of
decree. The rule that ambiguities in tax laws are to be
resolved in favor of taxpayers has no application here
because it is impossible to determine which basis would
impose a greater burden. And neither construction is to
be preferred on the ground that the other would raise
serious question as to constitutional validity. The generality of the words used in both Acts indicates intention
that the value at the time of death of the decedent was
to be taken as the basis in all cases.
The Revenue Act of 1918 and subsequent Acts taxed
incomes of estates during the period of the administration including profits on sales of property, and such gains
are calculated on value at date of decedent's death.*

Opinion of the Court.

280 U. S.

There appears to be no reason why gains or losses to the
estate should be calculated on one basis and those to the
residuary legatees on another.
Treasury Regulations under the Revenue Acts in force
between 1917 and 1928 declared that value at time of
the death of decedent should be taken as the basis for
ascertaining profit or loss from sale of property acquired
by bequest or descent since February 28, 1913. Regulations 33, Revised, paragraph 44, promulgated with reference to § 2(a), Revenue Act of 1916, provided that in
computing profit or gain upon property acquired by inheritance, the basis should be appraised value at the time
of decedent's death. Regulations 45, Art. 1562, promulgated with reference to § 202 of the Revenue Act of 1918
declared that "for the purpose of determining the profit
or loss from the sale of property acquired by bequest,
devise or descent since February 28, 1913, its value as
appraised for the purpose of the federal estate tax
.
should be deemed to be its fair market value when acquired." And value at the time of death is the basis of
that appraisal. § 402. 40 Stat. 1097. Regulations 62,
Art. 1563, under the Act of 1921 are substantially to the
same effect as the earlier regulations.
These regulations were prepared by the department
charged with the duty of enforcing the Acts. The rule
so established is reasonable and does no violence to the
letter or spirit of the provisions construed. A reversal
of that construction would be likely to produce inconvenience and result in inequality. It is the settled rule
that the practical interpretation of. an ambiguous or
doubtful statute that has been acted upon by officials
charged with its administration will not be disturbed except for weighty reasons. Logan v. Davis, 233 U. S. 613,
627. Maryland Casualty Co. v. United States, 251 U. S.

U. S. 322, 331.

BREWSTER v. GAGE.
327

Opinion of the Court.

The meaning of " acquired " in § 202(a) of the Act of
1918 Was not changed by and in context means the-same
as does the phrase "time of such acquisition" in the
corresponding provision of the Act of 1921. And that
phrase was continued in § 204(a) (5) of the Revenue Acts
of 1924 and 1926. 43 Stat. 258. 44 Stat. 14. The regulations promulgated under that section are substantially
the same as the earlier regulations. Regulations 65, Art.
1594. Regulations 69, Art. 1594. The substantial reenactment in later Acts of the provision theretofore construed by the department is persuasive evidence of legislative approval of the regulation. National Lead Co. v.
United States, 252 U. S. 140, 146. United States v. Cerecedo Hermanos y Compaiiia,209 U. S.337, 339. United
States v. G. Falk & Brother, 204 U. S. 143, 152. The
subsequent legislation confirmed and carried forward the
policy evidenced by the earlier enactments as interpreted
in the regulations promulgated under them.
The Revenue Act of 1928, § 113(a) (5), expressly established value at the time of the death of the decedent as
the basis of calculation in respect of sales of personal
property acquired by specific bequest and of real estate
acquired by general or specific devise or by intestacy, and
in all other cases fixed fair market value at the time of
distribution to the taxpayer as the basis. 45 Stat. 819.
The deliberate selection of language so differing from that
used in the earlier Acts indicates that a change of law was
intended. Ordinarily, statutes establish rules for the
future, and they will not be applied retrospectively unless
that purpose plainly appears. United States v. Magnolia
Co., 276 U. S. 160, 162, and cases cited. There is no support for the suggestion that subdivision (5) expressed the
meaning, or was intended to govern or affect the 6onstruction, of the earlier statutes.
Judgment affirmed.
