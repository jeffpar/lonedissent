for bringing up the case is drawn from the hypothesis
that. the examination of the vessels took place upon
Hester's father's land. As to that, it is enough to say
that, apart from the justification, the special protection

No. 198. Argued February 19, 1924.--Decided lay 5, 1924.
1. No .contract of &carrier can reduce the amount of charges legally

from liability a shipper who has assumed their payment; nor can
any act or omission of the cArier (except the running of the statute

full amoun.t by the person liable. P. 65.
2. But, in the absence of a governing tariff provision, delivery of the
goods for shipment does not-necessarily import an obligation of the
shipper to pay the freight charges, and the carrier and shipper are
free to contract as to when and by whom payment shall be made,

Mr. Homer' W. Davis, with whom Mr. Gardiner
Lathrop and Mr. Edward S. Joutt were on the briefs,
for plaintiff in error.
Prior, to the passage of the Interstate Commerce Act,
it was uniformly held that the shipment of goods under
a bill of lading containing no express provision requiring
payment of freight by the -consignor, impliedly bound
him so to do, irrespective of whether or not he was the
owner of the goods shipped. Wooster v. Tart, 8 Allen,
270; Blanchardv. Page, 8 Gray, 281; Holt v. Westcott,
43 Me. 445; Portland Flouring Mlls Co. v. British &

The reasoins which obtained prior to the Interstate
Commerce Act for holding a shipper primarily liable were
augmented by its passage.. In this case the consignor is
liable under the admitted facts. Pittsburgh,etc. By. Co.

406. Although these decisions relate only to. the. consignee's liability, -their reasoning applies to this case, and
they plainly show that instances of occasional hardship
must not be allowed to stand in the way of the collection
of tariff rates and the enforcement of the provisions of
.-the Interstate Commerce Act, which has for its object the
abolition of the numerous abuses which existed before it
was enacted.
Only a nominal hardship is imposed on a consignor by
holding him liable for an undercharge when the consignee
is solvent.
It seems pertinent to observe that if, as claimed by the
consignor and found by the courts below, the ultimate
consignee was solvent up to the time suit was brought,
then any hardship which either consignor or the bill of
lading consignee would suffer, should the consignor by the
judgment of this Court be now held liable, is the result of
the course pursued by the consignor in this case.
It is undisputed that demand was made on the consignor before suit was brought and that theconsignor had
a contract for the sale of the coke f. o. b. Holt, Alabama,
t6 the firm of Tutwiler & Brooks of Biriningha, Ala,
bama, the bill of lading consignee.
Instead of paying the undercharge and making collection from either Tutwiler & Brooks 6r the Smelter Corporation, the consignor, so far as the record shows, did
nothing before, or for over fifteen months after, the suit
was brought, when it filed a demurrer to the complaint.
If, as testified, the Smelter Corporation was solvent up
t6 January, 1920, and for three months thereafter, and
during that time could have been forced to pay the amount
due on execution, there is no reason why the consignor and
Tutwiler & Brooks could not have iaade'collection during
that period from the Smelter Corporation, since the purchase of goods f. o. b. a given point with directions to'the.
consignor to ship to some other point, and the payment of

the purchase price, unquesti6nably binds the purchaser to
see tbat the consignor or the party from whom th6 gbods
are purchased is not thereafter held liable for the freight
charges.
Neither estoppel nbr election can become the mbans of.
avoiding payment of tariff rates. Pittsburgh,etc., Ry. Co.
v. Fink, 250 U. S. 577.
No reason is given by the court below in explanation
of 'its position that, while by conduct a carrier could not
raise an estoppel which wbuld release a consignor, yet by
the same kind of conduct it could make an election whi.nch
would have that effect.
It has frequently beeikheld that'the doctrine of election
of remedies is simply an application of the law of estoppel.
Crockett First "NationalBank v. Barse Live Stock Cornmission Co., 198 Ill. 232; Baker v. Edwaris, 176 N. C.
229; Warriner v. Fant, 114 Miss. 174; Bierce, Ltd. v.
Hutchins, 205 U. S. 340.
Certainly, any election must arise out of some act of
the party who has -the choice of remedies, and not out of
an act or change in the financial responsibility of someone
else, and in either of those cases the only act of the Railroad Company would be to collect part of the charges
upon delivery at destination.
Furthermore, election applies in the case of inconsistent
and not alternative remedies. Friederchsen,v. Renard,
247 U. S.207. In the case of consignor and consignee,

it would not be inconsistent to sue both of them at the
same time for freight charges, although recovery from
either would bar the suit against the other. The rights
of the carrier to hold either or both are alternative or
cumulative. Central R. R. Co.. v. MacCartney, 68 N. J.

It is true that, in practically all of the above cases,
there was no dispute but that the consignee was insolvent,
because it is not the practice to collect undercharges from
consignors when there is any reasonable prospet of making collection from the consignee.
But all the cases referred to were decided on the ground
that there was, and must be, to enforce the iterstat.e
Commerce Act, an absolute liability on the part of the
consignor to pay if the consignee does not.
The consignee was not solvent when this suit was
brought, except in the sense that one may be said to be
solvent until adjudged otherwise.

ered f. o. b. cars.at the seller's plant -in Holt, Alabama.
Before delivery by the seller, the purchasers sold the coke
to the Great Western Smelters Corporation of Mayer,
Arizona. Thereafter, under instructions from Tutwiler
& .Brooks, and upon their agreement to pay the freight,
the Central Company delivered, at its plant, the cars of
coke to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; directed
shipmen . -thereof to Mayer over that railroad .and connecting lines; and took bills of lading which it delivered
immediately to Tutwiler & Brooks. That firm made a
draft for the purchase price on the Smelters Corporation,
with bills of lading attached. The corporation paid the
draft; received the bills of lading; and, upon surrendering
them to the delivering carrier and payment to it of the
freight demanded, obtained possession of'the coke. The
amount of the freight then demanded and paid was
$5,082.15. The freight legally payable, according to the
tariff, was $8,545.61.
The undercharge was apparently not discovered until
January, 1920. The Louisville and Nashville then made
demand upon the Central Company for the amount
($3,463.46). .Payment being refused, this action to
recover it' was brought in the federal court for the
Northern District of Alabama, Western Division. Each
party requdsted a directed verdict. It was directed for the
defendant; judgment entered thereon-was affirmed by the
Circuit Court of Appeals, 284 Fed. 250; and the ase is
here on writ of error under ยง 241 of the Judicial Code.
Most of the facts were agreed. The bills of lading
acknowledged receipt of the coke from the Central Company; stated that the coke was "consigned to Order Of
Tutwiler & Brooks, Destination Mayer, Arizona, . . .
Notify Great Western Smelters.Corporation"; and pro'vlded; among other so-called conditions, that "The owner
or con*gnee shall pay the freight," and average, if
any, . .- . and, if required, shall pay the same before

delivery!" There was no suggestion that Tutwile &
Brooks were insolvent.- Whether collection could then
have been made from the Smelters Corporation is a
matter as to which there was conflicting evidence.2
..The shipment being an interstate one, the freight rate
was that stated ,inthe tariff filed with the Interstate
Commerce -Commission. The amount of the freight
chares legally payable was determined by applying this
tariff rate to the actual weight. Thus, they were fixed by
law. No contract of the carrier could reduce the amount
legally payable; or release from liability a shipper who
had assumed an obligation to pay the charges. Nor could
any act or omission of the carrier (except the running of
the statute of limitations) estop or preclude it from enforcing payinent of. the full amount by a person liable
therefor. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis

the goods shipped were made deliverable to the order of a named

'The corporation was not then technically insolvent. That is, no

proceeding in bankruptcy had been instituted by or against it; there
was no outstanding unsatisfied eecution; and the corporatioii was
still in possession of some unencumbered property. If the error had
been discovered within a few months after delii'ery of the coke, the

delivering carrier might easily have obtained payment of the amount
of the undfercharge by applying to that purpose funds of the Smelters
Corporation then on deposit with it.

Bulletin No. 7, issued August 1, 1917: "The law requires the carrier
to colleAb and the party legally responsible to pay the lawfully
established rates without deviatioh therefrom. It follows that it is
the duty of carriers to exhaust their legal remedies in order to collect
undercharges from the party or parties legally responsible therefor.
It is not for the Commission, however, to determine in any case which
party, consignor or consignee, is legally liable for the undercharge,
that being a question determinable only by a court having jurisdiction
and upon the facts of each case." This ruling, which was adopted
May 1, 1911, and "interpreted" May 4, 1918, was amended, on
March 6, 1922, by calling attention to the provision inserted in the
Uniform Domestic Bill of Lading prescribed October 21, 1921. By
that provision the consignor may (see Section 7 of Conditions and

Opinion of the Court.

consignee does not pay the charges demanded upon delivery of the goods, Or the carrier may accept the goods
for shipment solely on account of. the consignee-, and,
knowing that the shipper is acting msrely as agent for
the consignee, may contract that only the latter shall be
liable for the freight charges. Or both the shipper and
the consignee may be made liable. Nor does delivery of
goods to a carrier necessarily import, under the general
law, an absolute promise by the shipper to pay the freight
charges. We must, therefore, determine what promise,
if any, to pay freight charges was, in fact, made by the
Central Company.
To ascertain-what contract was entered into we look
primarily to the bills of lading, bearing in mind that the
instrument serves both As a receipt and as a contrac.
Ordinarily, the person-from whom the goods are received
'for shipment assumes the obligation to pay the freight
charges; -and hi obligation is ordinarily a prinary one.
This is true even: where the bill of lading contains, as
here, a provision imposing liability upon the .consignee..
For the shipper is presumably the consignor; the transportation ordered by him is presumably on his own behalf; and a promise by'him to pay therefor is inferred
(that is, implied in fact), as a promise to pay.for goods
is implied, when one orders them from a dealer. But this
inference may be rebutted, as in the case of other contracts. It may be shown, by the bill of lading or otherwise, that the shipper of the goods was not acting on his-

own behalf; that this fact was known by the carrier; that
the parties intended not only'that the consignee should
assume an obligation to pay the freight charges, but that
the shipper should not assmine any liability whatsoever'

therefor; 6 or that he should assume only a secondary
liability. In this case, the bills of lading acknowledge
receipt of the coke from the Central Company. But it did
not sign them. -Nor was it described therein as the consignor. There was no clause by which the shipper agrees
expressly either to pay thb freight charges or to guarantee
their payment. The goods received were not declared to
be deliverable to the Central Company's order. On the
contary, the form of the bills of lading indicated that it
was neither the owne nor the person on whose behalf
the shipment was being made; and that Tutwiler &
Brooks were either the owners or the persons in whose
behalf the shipment was being made. On these facts, the

Opinion of the Court.

It is urged that, if the Central Company was not under
a primary obligation to pay the freight charges, it was'
secondarily liable, because collection from the Smelters
Corporation of the balance iemaining due had become
impossible before the undercharge was'discovered. But
the trial judge was not compelled so to find. There was
evidence that such collection had not become impossible.
Confessedly no effort was made to collect from it. Nor
was any effort made to collect from Tutwiler & Brooks.
Moreover, if 'a secondary obligation of the Central Company was to be implied from the fact of its causing the

coke to be received: for transportation, the ]romise was
not necessarily one to pay at any time any freight charges
which the carrier might fiJnd it impossible to collect from
the consignee or his assign. The court might have concluded that it guaranteed merely that the consignee or
his assign would accept the shipment. For, under the rule
of the Fink Case, if a shipment is accepted, the consignee
becomes liable, as a matter of law, for the full amount of
the freight charges, whether they are demanded at the
time of delivery, or not until later. His liability satisfies
the requirements of the Interstate, Commerce Act.
