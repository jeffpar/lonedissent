had been unjustly burdened. It may be that in a circuit
and district where no usage or rule of court exists, such
costs may not be taxed. We are not called upon to decide
that. It is enough, that we may decide this appeal, to
hold that it was not an abuse of discretion or a violation
of law for the District Court in the Second Circuit -to
allow the -item.
By the Act of August 13,1894, c. 282,28 Stat. 279, Congress has made elaborate provision for the safe use -of
surety companies as security upon boirds required in cburt
and other proceedings, and while it does not exclude ifidi-vidual sureties, itoffers' most convenient and stable
means of obtaining indemnity against the default of
parties. This is much to be prpferred to individual sureties because a properly conducted surety comeany'makes
it its business promptly to investigate and to meet its
.liabilities. Acceptance-of the service of such companies
Iis, of course, uipon the basis of a regular rate of compensation, and where a party litigant. has, because of the
claim of the opposing party, been .compelled t6 furniih
such security, and it turns out that it was wrongly required, a rule of court or usage which iiAposes the expense
of the securiti on th6 defeated party is not unreasonable.
•The decree of the DistrictCourt is affirmed.

Argument for Respondents.

265 U.S.

The contracts set outin the petition, upon which both
the claim of petitioner and the counterclaim of the United
States are based, are contracts with the Fleet Corporation,
not contracts with the United States; therefore the Court
of' Claims has no. jurisdiction over either the original
claim or the counterclaim.
Every question as to liability under these contracts is•
settled by the decision of. this Court in the combined
cases of Sloan Shipyards Corpordtion, Astoria Mar'ie
Iron Works, and Wood, Trustee, 258 U. S. 549.
Action in the Court of Claims is barred by § 154 of the
Xudicial Code. United States v. Wdrdwell, 172 U. S. 48;
Finn v. Unitted States, 123 U. S. 227; Corona Coal Co. v..
United States, 263 U. S. 537.
A counterclaim by the Government can only be allowed against a claimant against the Government. Jud.
Code, § 145.
The question of the remedy on the claims arising under
contracts made by the Fleet Corporation is a question of
jurisdiction which grarely affects claimants who may
pursue a remedy upheld as proper by this Court. It is
of the utmost imaportance that the rule of stare decisis be
adhered to in such cases, and that therefore the decision.
of this Court in the Sloan Case be followed in all like
cases.
The wrongffil order of court deprived petitioner of its
right to trial by jury and the writ asked is a proper remedy
for this wrong. Ex parteSimins, 247 U. S.231; Ex parte

therefore immaterial whether the counterclaim" grows out
of contract or-tort; it may be pleaded with the same effect
in either case. Allen v. United States, 17 Wall. 207;
McElrathv. United States, 102 U. S. 426.
Whenever the Government pleads a counterclaim in the
Court of Claims, it acquires a substantial right, and the
plaintiff's right to dispose of his case in any way he may
see fit is accordingly qualified. If the Court of Claims
has no jurisdiction of a claim presented, the counterlaim follows the fate of the- claim, and yi7 be dismissed
with it. Baltimore and Ohio R. B. (o. v. United States,
34 Ct. Cls. 484. But if the Court df Claims has jurisdic-

tion of the'claim, the counter.claim becomes part of the
suit, and unless the United States consents to its dismissal, it must be prosecuted to a conulusion. :Huske v.
United States, 46 Ct. Clms. 35. The counterclaim, it is
true, was not Med before the suit was dismissed, but notice
of it had been given with a reqdest to allow it to be filed.
Under the statute the Government had an absolute right
to file its counterclaim. Th6re is no rule in the Court of
Claims limiting the time within which a counterclaim
may be filed.
This Court does not prescribe the rules 6f practice in
the Court of Claims. It is therefore submitted that, in so
far as the rules 6f the Cqurt of Claims are not inconsistent'
with law, the Court of Claims must be presumed'tg.know
its- own rules. and to interpret them correctly. The
applicable rule.'of law was settled many years ago in
Huske's Case, .supra. The point is also directly covered
'in McEiratliv. United States, 102 U. S. 426.
-Under the decisiois'and uniform practice of the'Cout
of
Claims, a claimant is not permitted to dismiss his claim
"except
by order of the-court made.after due fiotice

United States. It -is not evei essential that a counterclaim should be filed in order to pernjit the V ited States

MR. CrsF JusTICE TAT delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Thfs is a petition for-a writ of mandamus directed to, the
Court of Claims to restore its order of April 30, 1923, disiissing the suit of the Skinner. &. Eddy Corporation
against the United States, and to set aside its order of November 28, 1923, vacating the order of dismissal, and to
prohibit the 'court from attempting to exercise further
jurisdictioi in the case. The judges of the Court of
Caims have made a respons6 to a rule to show cause.
On June 15, 1921, the petitioner brought" this uit
againist the United States in the Cburt*of Claims for $17,493,488.97. The cause of action was based on balances
alleged to be due for the construction of certain ships, for
bonuses for advanced deliveries of thers, and for exra;
labor, extra work, and repairs on other vessels, all for the
United States. The principal part of the claim grew out
of the cancellation of two contracts between the petitioner
and the United States Emergency' Fleet Corporation
"representing the United States." The largest item of
the claim was for ahticipated profits on 25 vessels. On
August 15, 1921, no plea, answer or notice 6f any couLter'claim having been filed by the Government, a general
traverse was entered by the Clerk of the Court under its
Rule No. 34. .No further pleadingswere'flled and no pro-.
.ceedifigs were had of any kind until April 11, 1923, when
petitioner filed its motion to dismiss -the *suit-without
prejudice.. The petitioner based the motion on the
ground that it had begun its suit under the Act of June
15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182, 183, as amended by § 2, par.
c, of the Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, c. 250,
41 Stat. 989; that, as interpreted by this Court, these acts
required the claims to be first presented to the President

for him to determine the just compensation, prior to the.
filing of a suit, and that as this claim was not presented tb
the President, the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction.
0n'April 12th, the Government moved to withdraw its
general traverse and Ior leave to file its answer and crcoss
bill. The motions were argued and on April 30,1923, the
court made an order granting the petitioner's motion and
dismissed its petition.
. On May 1, 1923, one day after the'dismissal, the
peti- "
tioner filed a suit. against the United- States Shippiig
Board Emergency Fleet Corporation in the state court of
Washihgton at Seattle, on substantially the same causes of
action as those sued for in the Court of. Claims, but omitting certain phases of damages claimed, for'$9,129,401.14.
On June 9, 1923, at the same term of the court, the Government moved for a reargument of petitioner's motion
to dismiss without prejudice, and.to allow the Government.to file a counterclaim. The motion was inadvertently overruled October 22, 1923, but upon'restoramtion and
reargument, the order of dismissal was vacated and leave
"
was given 1o the Government to file its counterclaim.
It is intimated on behalf of the Government that the
reason given by the petitioner for its motion to dismiss
in April, 1923, was not a genuine one. The petitioner
offers that and others. Others are that under the decision
of this Court in Sloan Shipyards Corporation v. Emer"
gency Fleet Corporation,258 U. S. 549, andEmergency
Fleet Corporatio4v. Sulliva's, 261 U. S. 146, it was
doubtful whether under the contracts sued on a recovery"
could be had. against the Gpvernment in the Court of
Claims, and second, that it was doubtful whether under
Russell Motor Co. v. United States, 261 U. S. 514, there
could be ny recovery for anticipated profits under the.
cancelled contracts which was the. -basis for nearly half

of the claim.
We think this mandamus must be granted. At common
law a.plabtiff has an absolute right'to discontinue or dis-

It is ordinarily the undisputed right of a plaintiff to dismiss a bill in equity before final hearing. McGowan v.
Columbia, etc., Association, 245 U. S.,352, 358. In Pullma's Palace Car Co. v. Central TransportationCo., I71
U. S; 138, 146, this statement of the rule in City of Detroit
v. Detroit City Ry. Co., 55 Fed. 569, wis apj'roved:
" It is very clear- from an examination of the authorites, English and American, that the right of a complainant to dismiss his bill without prejudice, on payment of
costs, wag of course except ih certain cases. Chicago &
A. R. Co. v. Union Rolling-Mill Co., 109 U. S. 702. The
exception was where a dismissal of the bill would prejudice the defendants in some other way than by the mere prospect of being harassed and vexed by future litigation
of the same kind."

Electric Co. v. Holland, 160 Fed. 768; Morton Trust CQ.

v. Globe Gaslight Co., 121 Fed. 1015; Youtsey v. Hoffman, 108 Fed. 699; McCabe v. Southern Ry. Co., 107
Fed. 213.
The right to dismiss, if it exists, is absolute. It does not
depend on the reasons which the plaintiff offers for his
action. The fact that he may not have disclosed all his
reasons or may not have given the real one can not affect
his right.
The usual ground for denying a complainant in equity
the right to dismiss his bill without prejudice at his own
costs is that the cause has proceeded so far that the defendant is in a position .to demand on the pleadings an

opportunity. to seek affirmative relief and he would be
prejudiced by being remitted to a separate action. Having been put to the trouble pf getting his counter case
properly pleaded and ready, he may insist that the cause
proceed to a decree.
We do not perceive in the circumstances of this case
any such ground for making an exception to the general
rule, as was shown in Western Union Tel. Co. v. American
Bell Tel. Co., 50 Fed. 662, 664, or in City of Detroit v.
Detroit City Ry. Co., 55 Fed' 5.69, or Manufacturing Co.

Fed. 602, or in Bank v. Rose, 1 Rich. Eq. 292, or Booth v..
Leycester, 1 Keen, 247.
Under § 145 of the Judicial Code, the Coirt of Clai's
is given jurisdiction to hear and determine all counterclaims on the part of the Government " against any claimant against the Government in said court." Under Rule
34 of that cout, notice of such counterclaim must be filed
within 60.. days after the service 'of the petition on the
Attorney General. In this case, no such counterclaim
was filed and a; general traverse was noted by the clerk.
Eighteen months elapsed and nothing was done when the
petitioner moved to dismiss withouti prejudice, and then
the GoveMmen without proffering any actual counterclaim asked for leave to file one, objecting to dismissal.
The case was- dismissed but six mionths later it was restored
a coimterclaim filed.*
"The and
Government
had not when the case was dismissed
given any time or expense to the preparation and filing
of a cross bill pr of. the evidence to sustain it. It had not
taken any action in respect -to the cause which entitled,
it to say that it would be prejudicbd by a dismissal within
the meaning of the adthorities. It suddenly was awakened by the motion to disniiss to the fact that by. eighteen
months' delay) it was losing a possible- opportunity to
litigate a cross claire in the Court of Claims and without a

Opinion of the Court.

jury. We think the same rule should obtain in the procedure of the Court of Claims as in federal courts of law
and equity in respect to the dismissal of cases without
prejudice.:
But there is a special reason why the rule must be enforced in this case. By § 154 of the Judicial Code, it is
provided that:
"'No person shall file or prosecute in the Court of
Claims, or in the Supreme Co.urt on appeal therefrom, any
claim for or in respecf to which he or any assignee of his
has pending in any other court any suit or process against
any person who* at the time when the cause of action
alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect
thereto, -acting or professing' to act, mediately or inmediately, under the authority of the United States.'
The day after the dismissal of this suit in the Court of
Claims, April 30, 1923, the petitioner filed-suit in a state
court of Washington for something more than nine millions of dollars for the same causes of action as those sued.
-for in the Court of CIa'.ns except the claims for anticipated profits. That suit and the section of the Code just
quoted necessarily prevent the petitioner from suing on
those claims in the .Court bf Claims, and exclude its jurisdiction of them, because the Fleet Corporation which-is
sued in the Washington court was certainly acting or professing to act, mediately or immediately, under the authority of the United States. The jurisdiction of these
claims by the Court of Claims having been parted with by
the order of dismissal in' April can not be resumed by a
retroactive order of the subsequent.November, in view of
the restrictive provisions of § 154, which, by reason of the
Washington suit, intervene and apply. Corona,Coal Co.
v. United States, 263 U. S. 537.
It only remains to inquire whether this is a proper case
for the writ asked. Mandamus is an extraordinary
remedial process which is awarded, not as a matter of

right, but in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion.
Although classed as a legal remedy, in issuing it a court
*must be largely controlled by equitable principles. Duncan Townsite Co. v. Lane, 245 U. S. 308, 312; Arant v.
L.ne, 249 U.'S..367, 371. It would be a useless waste of
time and effort to enfoice a trial in the Court of Claims
if we were, upon appeal, to find that the petitioner was unjustly deprived of his substantial right -to dismiss his
petition, as *e should have to do for. the reasons stated.
Added to this is the consideration which has been regarded as furnishing a substantial ground. foi the extraordinary process of the writ that the petitioner by a denial
of his right to dismiss in the Court of Claims will be de-prived of a right.of trial by jury in the state court of
