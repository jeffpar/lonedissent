coke to be received: for transportation, the ]romise was
not necessarily one to pay at any time any freight charges
which the carrier might fiJnd it impossible to collect from
the consignee or his assign. The court might have concluded that it guaranteed merely that the consignee or
his assign would accept the shipment. For, under the rule
of the Fink Case, if a shipment is accepted, the consignee
becomes liable, as a matter of law, for the full amount of
the freight charges, whether they are demanded at the
time of delivery, or not until later. His liability satisfies
the requirements of the Interstate, Commerce Act.

After a hearing, at which much evidence was introduced,
the coi.mwssionmade an order which directed the xilway
company to construct and maintain a roadway for vehicles
across its tracks at McCarr Siding. It limited the use of
the crossing to the transportation of freight consigned
to the complainant and other shippers, and required that
the entrance to the crossing at the north side of the track
be closed by a gate to be f.rnished by complainant and
to be by him -kept locked, except when the crossing was
being so used; and directed that, while the crossing was
being used by complainant for the transportation of goods
across. the tracks in vehicles, he should provide a watchman to give notice of approaching trains.

The facts may be briefly stated. AtMcCarr Siding,
there are four parallel tracksi--an eastbbund main line,
a westbound main line, a track between these, and a
branch line extending across the Tug River. There is
also a spur track extending southeasterly from the main
line tracks to the tipple of the Allburn Coal Corporation'
and intersecting the approach to the proposed crossing
about 200 feet therefrom.
The railroad tracks are on the north bank of the Tug
River which at this place is the boundary between West
Virginia and Kentucky. The village adjoins the company's right of way on the north and is located on a bluff
considerably higher than the railroad tracks. Its population is about 100. Complainant's store is on a hillside
a short distance north of the tracks. The Allburn Coal
(orporation owns a dou]ledecked bridge across the river.
almost directly opposite the store. The upper level of
the bridge is used for transportation of coal, and the
lower level is used for pedestrian and vehicular travel.
Though privately owned, it has been used by the public
for a number of years as a part of the traveled way between the village and the territory south of the river. By
reason of a sharp curve in the tracks and-a deep cut, the

view of the crossing is obstructed, so that enginemen on
approaching trains can see it for only a short distance.

McCarr Siding was established for the accommodation
of the Allburn Coal Company about 10 or 12 years prior
to the filing of the complaint. The tariffs of the railway company and its shipping instructions state that the
siding is a carload billing point. It is also a prepay station to which freight in carload and le~s than carload lots
may be shipped, to be delivered at the risk of consignees.
The coal company and complainant *receive by far the
larger part of the freight. The amount received by
others is small. When the mines of the Allburn Coal
Corporation are fully operated, eight or ten carloads of
coal are loaded daily. Other outgoing shipments, consisting principally of boxes, containers and household
goods, are also made. The siding is a flag station for

three passenger trains, two eastbound and one westbound
daily. For that purpose it serves about 1000 people living in the vicinity, including many on the Kentucky
side of the river. From 10 to 30 people get on and off
trains at McCarr daily. Mail for the village is carried
by railroad and delivered at the siding.
Compla'mant has been engaged in business in the village for many years. He-handles merchandise in substantial volume. His freight bill amounts to about $300 a
month. The goods come in less than carload and in carload lots and are delivered by the company at the siding.
Most of them are brought from the west. Less than carload lots are deposited by the company on the ground
on the south side of the tracks opposite his place of business, and carloads are delivered at approximately the
same place. It is necessary for him to move his freight
across the four intervening tracks. No station facilities
have ever been furnished at the siding, and the commission found that the company's failure to afford reasonable facilities for the removal of comaplainantl's freight

from its premises causes him damage, delay and inconvenience.
Because of the damger attending the use ofthe crossing,
the railway company, shortly before the commencement
of these proceedings, planted posts about five feet apart
for a distance of about 50 feet along the right of way on
the north side of .its tracks to obstrict the crossing and
prevent its use for' vehicular traffic. This compelled
complainant to carry the freight consigned to -him by
hand across the tracks at a cost greatly in excess of the
expense of hauling it in vehicles.
.The State, in the exercise of its police power, directly
or through an authorized commission, may require railroad carriers to provide reasonably adequate and suitable
facilities for the convenience of the communmties served
by them. But its power to regulate is not unlimited.' It
may not unnecessarily or arbitrarily trammel or interfere
with the operation and conduct of railroad projerties and
business. Mississippi Railroad Commissi n. v. Mobile &
Ohio R. R. Co., 244 U. S.388, 390, 391. The validity of
reglatory measures may be challenged on the ground
that they transgress the Coistitution; and *thereupon it
becomes the duty of the court, in the light of the facts in
the case, to determine whether the regulation is reasonable and valid or essentially unreasonable, arbitrary and
void. Wisconsin, Minnesota & Pacific R. R. v. Jacobson,
'179 U. S. 287, 297, 301; Burns Baking Co.v. Bryan, 264
U. S. 504. Railroad carriers may be compelled by state
legislation to establish statibns at proper places for the
convenience of their patrons. Minneapolis & St. Louis
R. R: Co. v. Minnesota, 193 U. S. 53, 63. Any measure
promulgated by the State to require a railroad company
to provide suitable facilities reasonably necessary for the
removal froni its premises of freight carried by it for its
customers does not create a new duty or impose. any unnecessary burden.

NORKFOLK RY. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM.
:70

Opinion of the C6urt.

The facts in .this case clearly show the need of some"
facilities at McCatr Siding for the use'of the patrons of
the railroad. The order directing the company to construct and maintain a crossing for the use of vehicles to
haul the freight across the tracks is i,light burden upon
the carrier and cannot be said to be unreasonable and arbitrary. It need not be considered whether the company,
in the interest of the safety of those using the crossing,
lafvfully might have been required to furnish the gate and
provide the watchman.
To support its contention that the.order is inconstitutional, the compan:r asserts that the order takes from it
and gives to complainant the control of the crossing; that
it prevents the use of the crossing without the consent
and participation of complainant, and compels the company to enter into' an arrangement or agreement with
complainant making him its agent.to control the use of
the crossing and.to guard it while being used. These contentions are without merit. The order does not impair
or interfere with the company's right to permit the crossing to be used for purposes other than those specified in
the order or prevent the company from guarding the
crossing by watchmen or otherwise as it sees fit. Manifestly the limitation upon the use of the crossing and the"
imposition of duties on the complainant in respect ofthe
gate and the guarding of tht crossing were for the benefit
of the company. The effect of these provisions was to
relieve the carrier of-a part of the burden and expense
of providing facilities deemed reasonable and necessary
for the removal of freight consigned to complainant and.
others at the siding.- We find nothing in the order that
deprives the company of its property. without due process of law or denies to it the equal protection of the laws.
Judgment affirmed.
