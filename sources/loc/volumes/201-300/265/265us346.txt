Opinion of the Court.

That the.appellee is dearly within the terms of the Interstate Commerce Act is shown by the different amendments to the act. PennsylvaniaCo. v. UnitedStates; 236

-Common carriersare often compelled to operate branch
lines where the public necessity therefor appears.
That defendant .enjoyed no right of eminent domain
from the State of Mchigan, does not relieve it from its
duty to afford the public an admittedly necessary transportation service.
The public importance and necessity for this service.
cannot be doubted.

MR. JUSTIcE BuTim

delivered the opinion- of the

Court.
March 25, 1921, appellant filed his complaint in the
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, praying a mandatory injunction to compel appellee to operate
its -steamboats, Alpena II- and Mackinac II, on' the
Detroit and Mackinac route in the navigation season of
that year, as it had done in prior years.
Appellee is a corporation organized under the laws of
Michigan, and has long been a common carrier of passengers and freight for hire on steamboats operated by it.
between Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio, between
.Detroit and Buffalo, New York, and between Detroit and
Mackinac Island, Michigan. For many years, by arrangement with carriers by rail, it had carried some passengers
and freight under joint lake and rail tariffs providing for
continuous carriage, partly by railroad and partly by-

Opinion of the Court.

water, to and from various ports reached by its steamers,
and to and from points on lines of carriers by railroad.
Appellee proposed to discontinue service on the route between Detroit and Mackii= Island. , The complaint'
alleged that appellant had been in the past, and thathe
desired to become, in the season of 1921 and thereafter, a
passenger-and a shipper of freight on appellee's steamers
on the Detroit and Mackinac route. It further alleged
that it was appellee's duty to provide aud furnish trans-portation for pissengers and property during that season
and thereafter over the.route above named, and .i.atto
abandon such service would violate the Act'to Ri-glate
Commerce, as amended, and particulily subdivisions (1)
(a), (3) and (4) of § 1. Appellee nioved to dismiss the
complaint on the 'round that the court was without
jurisdiction, and that appellant was not entitled to the
relief prayed. The District Court held that the suit in:
vblved a federal question and was.within its juritdiction;.
and, on the merits, decided that appellant was not entitled
to relief and dismissed the complaint. 273 Fed. 577. The
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmedthe decree. 284 Fed.
497. The case is here on appeal under § 241 of. the
Judicial Code.
On the allegations of the complaint, the suit-is one
arising under the laws of the United States, and par.ticularly the Act. to Rigulate Commerce. Its decision
involves the construction and application of certain provisions of that act. It was rightly .held in the courts
below that the District Court had jurisdiction. Louismle & Nashville R?. R. CJo. v. Rice, 247 U. S. 201, 203;
Greene v. Louisvile & Intemrbas B. R. Co., 244 U. S.

There remains the question whether appellee was
bourid to r~sume and m intain the service.
The -obligation -was not imposed by appellae's charter
or the statutes of Michigan.

The company was organized

under the Commerce and.Navigation Act of 1867; c. 181,
Compiled Laws 1897. By .compliance with the provisiohs of that act, persons were. authorized to become a
body corporate "-for the purpose of engaging in the-business of maritime commerce or navigation within this
state, or upon the frontier lakes or other navigable waters,
natural or artificial, connected therewith,

. . -"- The

General Corporation Act of lichigan of 1903; Compiled
Laws 1915, c. 175; superseded the -Act of 1867, buteontained a savdng clause as to rights which had been secured
under the earlier act. The act under which appellee was
organized does not prescribe or require the articles to
specify any route over which such a corporation is to
operate its boats, and does not require it to continue in
business. Appellee's articles of association adopted the
statutory language, and do not designate any route for
the operation of its boats, or require it to continue operation. Appellee has no power of eminent domain or
special privilege oi right in respect of the business it is
authorized.to do, which a natural person ownifig a vessel
and engaged in the same business does not have. It is
under no contractual obligation to operate on the route
in question. Act No. 56, Public Acts 1919, provides that
no person, firm or corporation owning or operating any
railroad shall abandon its main line or track or any portion thereof without the permission of the State Commission. There is no simil statute relating to carriers
by. water.
The obligation to continue is not imposed by any principle of the common law. Reasonableness of service on a
route over.which appellee operates boats is not involved..
The duty to furnish reasonable service while engaged in
business as a common carrier is to be distinguished from
the "obligation to continue in business. No case has
been cited by counsel, and we know of none, in which
it has been. held that there is any common. lw duty

on. a common carrier by water not to cease to operate
U
its boats.1
The obligation to continue service is not imposed
by any federal statute. Appellant relies on § 1, subd.
(1) .(a), of the Inieritate Commerce Act (as. amended.
by § 400, Transportation Act, 1920) which- provides that
the act shall apply to common carriers engaged in- the
transportationof passengers or propertywholly by railroad, or partly by railroad and partly by water, when both
are used under a common control; management, or arangement for rontiziuous carriage or shipment; and a
provision in subd. '(3) defining "carrier" to mean "common carrier ",- and " transportatin" to include loco-motives, cars and other vehicles, bessel, and all instrumentalities of shipment or *carriage; and. a provision of
subd. (4) making it the duty of eyery common cmrrer,
subject to the act, engaged in the transportation of
Spiassengers or property, to provide and furnish such
transportation upon reasonable request therefor.
But in connection with these provisions, there should
be read subd. (18) of the same. section, which provides
that no barrier by railroad subject to this act shall abandon all or any portion of a line of railroad, or the operation thereof, unless and until there shall first have been:
obtained from the Cobnmission a certificate that the pres.
ent or future public convenience and necessity permit'
such abandonment.

.Carriers'by water, such as appellee, are within the
terms of the Transportation Act for certain purposes;
e. g., for the- regulation of their accounts, the'making
of reports, the prevention of rebates, discrimination and
the like. Certain provisions.of the act- are apblicable to
some carriers and not to others. Interstate (Commerce
Commisio'n v. Goodrich, Tranit Co., 224 U. S. 194, 208.
The impositign of a duty upon a carrier by water to furnish transportation upon reasonable request does not
create an obligation to continue to operate boats on a
*particular route. The provision of subd. (18) above referred to is"specifically limited to lines of railroad. This
indicates legislative intention that carriers by water are
not required to continue andf may cease to operate if they
see fit.
No duty to continue to operate its boats on the Detroit
and Mackinac Island route is himposed on appellee by its
charter, the statutes of' Michigan, the common law or
federal statutes.
