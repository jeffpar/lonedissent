M-u. JVsT.cB HoLums delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These are bills in equity brought to restrain the collection of taxes upon the respective railroad companies for
the year 1922 on the ground that the farm lands in
Nebraska were systematically and intentionally undervalued while the railroad properties were valued at their
full worth and more. After a hearing by three Judges
sitting under § 266 of the Judicial Code, it was held that
the plaintiffs "had an adequate remedy at law under the
statutes of the State of Nebraska in prosecuting error
proceedings to the Supreme Court of the State of
Nebraska" and for that reason a preliminary injunction.
was denied. Appeals were.taken and the correctness of
the above ruling is the only question here. It is not disputed that the proceedings in the Supreme Court of the
State are purely judicial, sor that Prentisv. Atlantic Coast
Line ( o., 211 U. S. 210, does not apply to this case.

and itself determines the assessments upon railroads.
When it has made its final order it certifies it to the
counties and the county treasurers thereupon issue distress warrants and notify agents of delinquent corporations to pay over all moneys of the corporation in their
hands not exceeding the amount of the lax. A failure of
the agent to do so is made a misdemeanor hnd is punished by a fine. There is no provision for a, supersedeas
pending proceedings before the Supreme Court, and none
by which*the plaintiffs can pay under pretest and bring
an action at law. Dawson v. Kentucky Distiller7ies &
Warehouse Co., 255 U. S. 288, 296,297. Yet if the Board
is guilty of the conduct charged in-the, bill, the only
remedy given by the statute is a writ of error to take to
the Supreme Court a record prepared by. the Board.
Compiled Stats. 1922, § 5901.
If an action to recover the payment were allowed, the
suit might be brought in the Courts of the United States,
under the usual conditions, as well as in those of the
State. Singer-Sewing Machine Co. v. Benedict, 229 U. S.
481, 486.. But the writ of error of course can be sued out
only in the State, and a remedy in the State Courts only
has been held not to be enough. Smyth v. Ames, 169 U.S.
466, 516. St. Louis-San FranciscoBy. Ca. v. McElvain,
253 Fed. 123, 136. Franklin v. Nevada-CfaliforniaPower
Co., 264 Fed. 643, 645. That however is not the only
.objection. On a writ of error the Court is confined to
the record. The most that it could do, it would seem,
would be, if errors appeared on the face of the redord,
to set aside an excessive valuation and remit the matter
to the same Board to try again, which is hardly satisfactory, if the Board is .seeking to evade the law. United
States v. Osage County, 251 U. S. 128, 133, 134. When
such a charge as the present is made it can be tried fully
and fairly only by a Court that can hear any and all
competent evidence, and that is not bound by findings of

jurifiction in equity over the case stated by the bill and
that therefore the Judges "should dispose of the application for a temporary injunction on the merits and otherwise proceed with the suit in regular course." Union

No. 762. Argued April 11, 1924.-Decided April 28, 1924.
1. The Act of September 26, 1918, c. 177, § 2, 40 Stat. 967, amending
§ 11(k) .of the Federal Reserve Act, authorizes a national bank
having the permit of the Federal Reserve Board, to act as executor,
if trust companies competing with it have that power by the law of
the State in which the bank is lobated, whether the exercise of
such power by the national bank is contrary to the state law or.
not. P. 23.
2. The power of Congress to grant such accessory functions to
national banks, to sustain them in the competition of the bankdng
business, cannot be controlled by state laws. First NationdBank
