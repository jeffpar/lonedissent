the title to real property, their decisions are retrospective
and may affect titles purchased on the faith of their
stability. Doubtful questions on subjects of this nature,
when once decided, should be 6onsideied no longer doubtful or subject to change."
That rule often has been applied in this and other
courts and we think effect should be given to it in the
present case.

Affirmed.
APPeAL from a decree of the District. Court dismissing
the billin a suit by the Governor of Oklahoma to enjoin
the prosecution of impeachment proceedings in the state
legislature as based on improper motives and as infringing
his rights to due process and equal protection of the law,
under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Mr. Finis B. Riddle and Mr. Henry B. Martin for
appellant.
A federal court has no .jurisdiction in equity generally,
where a contest over, or the title to, a state office, or a
question of iemoval of an officer in accordance with state
law, is involved; but will lend its aid against a wrongful
interference or removal under a void judgment, which

involves complainant's federal constitutional rights.

A court of equity has jurisdiction to entertain and
adjudicate upon the subject matter when any actionable
rights are involved and where there is no adequate, complete remedy at law. Where there is a wrong, equity
will furnish a remedy. 'A federal court in equity has
jurisdiction in such caseg where the complainant's constitutional rights are invaded. In. re Sawyer, 124 U. S.

The protection of the Federal Constitution securing
rights to individuals operates equally upon every state
agent, who is the repository of state power. Home Telephone Co. v. Los Angeles, 227 U. S. 278.
While a federal court in equity will not enjoin proceedings in a state court generally, it will enjoin the
execution of a void or fraudulent judgment after the suit
is ended, when complainant has no adequate and complete remedy at law. Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., 236
U. S. 115.
Where the issue involved is not a contest over the title
to an office, but involves a question of forfeiture on
account of alleged violation of specific grounds provided
in the state constitution, and the trial provided for is
befcire a court, and the judges are required to be sworn
to try the cause according to the law and the evidence,
then the subject-matter and the trial are judicial and not
political. Okla. Rev. Laws, 1910, ยง 2084; Rhode Island
v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. George F. Short, Attorney General of the State of
Oklahoma, for appellees. Mr. Leon S. Hirsh, Assistant

Attorney General, Mr. Irvin Wilson and Mr. 3. D. Lydick
were also on the brief.
MR. JusicF VAw DEvAWTU

R delivered the opinion of

the Court.
This is a suit in equity brought in a District Court of
the United States to enjoin the prosecution of articles of
impeachment against a state officer. 'he plaintiff is the
officer against whom the articles are directed, and the
principal defendants are officers designated to conduct the
prosecution before the Chief Justice and Senate of the
State sitting as a court of impeachment. The allegations
of the bill are very general, wanting in precision and
usually made on information and belief. In substance
the grounds on which the injunction is sought are that
the articles of impeachment were prompted by wrongful
motives and prejudice on the part of most of the members
of the House of Representatives of the State; that many
members of the Senate who will sit in the court of
impeachment have the same wrongful motives and
prejudice, and will be controlled by them instead of by
the evidence; and that to subject the plaintiff to a trial
before a body so constituted ivill work a denial of the
due process and equal protection to which he is entitled
under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States. In the District Court the defendants
challenged the bill by a motion to dismiss, and after a
hearing on that motion the court entered a decree of
dismissal. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.
The trial before the court of impeachment proceeded,
and the plaintiff was found guilty on some of the articles
and removed from office. While the impeachment proceeding was in an early stage, its validity was sustained
by the Supreme Court of the State, State v. Chambers,

Syllabus.

96 Okla. 78; and, after the proceeding was carried to
judgment, petitions for certiorari were denied by that
court and by this Court, 263 U. S. 721.
We think the District Court rightly dismissed the bill.
A court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appoint-

ment and removal of public officers, White v. Berry, 171
U. S. 366;. and particularly are the courts of the United
States sitting as courts of equity without jurisdiction over
the appointment and removal of state officers. In re

Sawyer, 124 U. S.200, 210. And see Taylor v. Beckham,
178 U. S.548; 570. That the removal is through a proceeding in the nature of a criminal prosecution does not
alter the rule.

In re Sawyer, supra,'pp. 210, 219.
