Opinion of tfie Court.*

plaintiffs in error were indicted and convicted of having

whiskey in-their possession'in the Indian Country, in
-Osage County, Okahoma, on July 24, 1920, in violation
,of the acts above mentioned. The case was taken on writ'
of error to the Circuit Courtof Appeals of the Eighth Circuit and that coiirt, under § 239 of the Judicial Code,
certified a*question of-law to this Court. It is tlis:
. "Was that portion of the Act of uly -23, 1892, Section
4136a, Comp. Stat., as amended by thb Act of Januark 30,
1897, Section 4137, Comp. Stat., and by the Act-of May 25,
1918, Section 4137a, Comp. Stat., which made possession-.
of intoxicating liquor in the Indiaii Country a crininb1
.offense and fixed the punishment Therefor f pealed, super-seded or modified by the enactment of the National Prohibiion Act, 41 Statutes at Large, 305, 308, Title II;
Sections 3, 25, 29, 33 and 35?'
The Act of 1918 provides that "possession by a person
of intbxicating liquor in-the Indian. country where the
introduction is or wat prohibited by treaty or Federal
statute shall be an offensd and punished in accordance
with" the. above mentioned A6ts of 1892 and 1897.
Mere possession is made criminal. The purpose of the'
possession or the intended use is not material. The particuIar place and its character, Indian Country, are essential. The. evils aimed at are those wbich result Ifrom.
liquor traffic in localities where Indians live or which they'
are liable to frequent. These statutes apply locally for
the special purpose of keeping whiskey and other intoxicants out of the reach of Indians.*
By the Eighteenth Amendment, the manufacture, sare'
or transportation of intoxicating liquors,.in the United
States and all territory stibject to the jurisdiction thereof,
for beverage pinrposes is prohibited. The National Pro-hibition Act was passed to enforce that Amendineit.
Liquor for non-beverage purposes may be purchased, sold
and possessed as specified in that act, but not in violation
