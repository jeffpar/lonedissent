UNITED DICTIONARY COMPANY v. G. & C. MERRIAM
COMPANY.
'APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 129. Argued January 23, 1908.-Decided February 3, 1908.

The requirement of the Copyright Act ofJune 18, 1874, .c.301, § 1, 18
Stat. '78 (Rev.Stat. § 4962), that notice shall be inserted in the several.
copies of every edition, does not extend to publications abroad and sold
only for use there.

-THE facts

are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George P. Fisher, Jr., Mr. James H. Peirce and Mr.
William.Henry Dennis, for appellant, submitted:
The copyright statute requires the insertion of. the copyright notice in editions of a book published abroad by and
with the consent of the owner of the American copyright on
such book. Rev. Stat. § 4962; Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U. S.
617 (652); Thompson v. Hubbard, 131 U. S. 123, and cases there
cited. As § 4962 contains no language excepting from its
provisions books published in foreign countries, or copyrighted
articles manufactured abroad, it applies to all books or like
copyrighted articles regardless of the country in which they
may be published or made. This is plaiu when that section
is read, in connection with other sections .of the same act.
Section 4956 of the Revised Statutes specifically,.provides
"that no person shall be entitled to a copyright unless he shall.
on or before the day of publicatior in this oi any foreign
country, deliver to the office of the Librarign of Congress" a
printed copy of the titleof his book; and the same section further provides as a prerequisite to a valid copyright,, that he

shall delivet tothb Librarian of Congress two copies of the
book "not later than the day of publication thereof in this or
-afiy foreign country.": The statute thus makes plain the fact
that the author may -publish his book either here or abroad.

By leave of court Mr. George W. Ogilvie, President of the

pellant.
Mr. William B. Hale, with whom Mr. Charles N. Judson,.
Mr. Frank F. Reed and Mr. Edward S. Rogers were on the
brief, for appellee:
Appellee's copyright is not invalidated by the failure to
insert the notice. of the American copyright in the books
published in England, but not imported by, or with the corn
sent of -appellee into the United States, because the statute
has no extra-territorial operation, and therefore does not
require such notice to be inserted in such foreign books.
The rule that statutes of a State or Nation have no extraterritorial operation has been applied to the Patent Act which.

By leave of court, Mr.Stephen H. Olin filed a brief herein
as amicus curi&e on behalf, of the American Copyright League
supporting the contention of defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the appellee to restrain the infringement of copyright in a book entitled "Webster's High
School Dictionary." The appellee, a Massachusetts corpora-.
tion, took out copyrights at the same time in England and
here. It published and sold the book in this country with the
statutory notice of copyright, and made a contract with English publishers, under which it furnished them with electrotype
plates of the work, and they published it in England, omitting
notice of the American copyright. The English work has a
different title, ." Webster's Brief International Dictionary,"
and has some other differences on the first three and last
thirty-four pages, but otherwise is the same. The appellant,
an Illinois corporation, sent for the English book with intent
to reprint it, and was about to publish it when restrained.
The'English publishers agreed not to import any copies of
their work into this country, and also to use all reasonable
means to prevent an importation by others, so that the appellee cannot be said to have assented to the appellant's act.
'So far as appears, the only copies that have been brought over
are the one above mentioned and anotheri purchased for use
but' not for sale, by the president and manager of the appellant. The question is whether the' omission of notice of the
American copyright from the English publication, with the
assent of the appellee,. destroyed its rights, or, in other words,
"whether the requirement cf the act of June 18, 1874, c. 301,
§1, 18 Stat. 78 (Rev. Stat. §49&2), that notice shall be in-

serted "in the several copies -of every edition published!"
extends to Ipublications abroad. The Circuit Court sustained
the defendant's dontention and dismissed the bill. 140 Fed.
Rep. 768. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision,146 Fed. Rep. 354; S. C., 76 C. 'C. A. 470, and the case is
brought to this court by appeal.
Notwithstanding the elaborateness of the arguments addressed to us and the difference of opinion in the courts below,
there
is not a great deal to be said, and thd answer seems to
us plain.
Of course, Congress could Attach what conditions
itsaw fit to its grant, but it is-unlikely that itwould make requirements.of personal action bey6nd the sphere of its control.
Especially is it unlikely that it would require a warning to
the public against the infraction of a law beyond the jurisdiction 'where, that law was in force. The reasons for doing so
have 'not grown less, yet in the late statute giving copyright
for foreign publications the notice is necessary only in "all
copies of such books sold or distributed in the United States."
Act of March 3, 1905, c, 1432, 33 Stat. 1000, amending Rev.
Stat. §4952. So ii is decided that the section punishing a
false notice, which .'naturally would be' coextensive with the
requirement of notice, did not'extend to' false statements
affixed abroad. McLoughlin v. Raphael Tuck Co., 191 U. S.
267. The. same conclusion would follow from the form prescnbed for the notice, which would be inapt in -foreign lands.
It is said that the act of 1905 cannot affect the construction
of the law under which the parties' rights were fixed, and it
cannot, beyond illustrating a policy that has not changed.
But the age of the condition affords another' reason' for confining it as the later :condition is confined." When it first was
attached, in 1802; there was little' ground to anticipate the
publication of American works abroad.. As, late as 1820
Sydney Smith, in the Edinburgh Review, made his famous
exclarpation, "In the four quarters of the globe, who reads an
American book?" if, however, there was a publication
abroad, importation without the consent of the owner was

Opinion of the Court.

forbidden in general terms, a fact giving another reason for
the narrower construction of § 4962. If that was the. true
construction once, it is the construction still. Again, when
the present act was passed, there was no foreign copyright for
an American author, and Congress knew and he knew, as he
knovrs now, if he contents himself with home. protection, that
his work might' be reprinted without notice of any sort.- Such.
reprints rather inconsistently are called piracies in argument.,
But whatever the moral aspects may be, the piracy is a legal
right, and as such -its-exercise must be contemplated by the author. It does not matter whether he does so with regret at
the loss of money or with joy at the prospect of fame, and it is
difficult to see any greater difference between giving consent
to the foreign publication and intentionally creating the opportunity, the inducement and the right. But it hardly would
be argued that because no copyright had been taken out in
- England and therefore the reprint there was lawful, an American copyright.*could be defeated by importing the English
book and reprinting from that. Thompson v. Hubbard, 131
U. S. 123, 150. - It would be even bolder to say that the American author would have stood worse if in' the days before he
could get a copyright in England he had made an arrange.ment with English- publishers to secure some payment from
them. Yet that is the logic of the appellant's case.
If a publication without notice of an American copyright
did not affect the copyright before the days when it was possible
to get an English copyright also, it is not to be-supposed that
Congress, by arranging with England for that possibility, gave
a new meaning to the old § 4962, increasing the burden of
American authors, and attempted to intrude its requirements
into any notice that might be provided by the English law.
The words of the Section remained unchanged, notwithstanding the grant of a limited liberty of importation, while other
sections were amended' where there was reason for a change.
It may be that in most cases the importation of a pirated
Eiiglish copy of an American book would be unlawful, whereas

it is, argued that the importation was lawful in the case at bar.
.The appellee makes a strong argument that the appellant's
importation was wrong. But it is hard to see how the right to
copy a book, whether lawfully or unlawfully imported, can be
affected by the -mode in -which it got here. The analogies of
the law are the other way. A person is subject to the jurisdiction, even if he was brought there by wrong. Pettibone v.
Nichols, 203 U. S. 192. A document is admissible in evidence,
although it was improperly obtained. Commonwealth v.
Tucker, 189 Massachusetts, 457, 470; 3 Wigmore, Evidence,
.§2183. The argument for the appellant dwells somewhat
fancifully on the possibilities of innocence being led astray.
All those possibilities might exist if a pirated volume should be
smuggled into the United States. Moreover the appellant
argues, with the support of the opinion of an Attorney General
and a Solicitor General, that under §4956 and its amendments,
two copies of an. unauthorized edition lawfully might be imported for use. 21 Op. Atty.-Gen. 159, 162. The statutes cannot be expected to do more than to secure the author and the
.public so far as is reasonably- practicable. The obvious plan
is not to be distorted by -the chance that. ingenuity may find
.-some way to slip through- the law untaught.
A we are. satisfied that the statute do s not req.iire notice
of the American copyright on books published abroad and sold
-only for use there, we agree with the parties that it is unnec.essary to discuss nice questions as to when a foreign reprint
may or may not be imported into the United States under the
present pro'(isions of our law.
Decree affirmed.
