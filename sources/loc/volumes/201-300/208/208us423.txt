We have-not referred in this discussion to the denial of the
elective franchise in the State of Oregon, for while it may dis-.
close a lack of political equality in all things with her brother,
that is not of itself decisive. -The reason runs deeper, and rests
in the inherent difference between the two sexes, and in the
different functions in life which they perform.
For. these reasons, and without questioning in any respect
the decision in'Lochnerv. New York, we are of the opinion that
it cannot be adjudged, that the, act in question is in conflict
with the Frdleral Constitution, so far as it respects the work

Wheri the jurisdictioh of the Circuit Court is questioned merely in respect
to ita general authority as a judicial tribunal to entertain a summary proceeding to compel repayment of assets wrongfully withheld from a receiver

the jurisdiction clause of 15 of the Judiciary Act of 1891.Where no sufficient reason: is stated warranting this court in deciding that
the Circuit Court acted without jurisdiction, this court will asmme that

delivered the Opinion of the court.

By a decree of the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Massachusetts, James D. Colt was appointed receiver of the property and assets of the Haight & Freese Company, a New York corporation, then ostensibly engaged in
business as stockbrokers in New York, Boston, Philadelphia
and other cities. Subsequently, and on May 9,1905, in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District
.of New York, upon a bill filed on behalf of one Ridgway Bowker
against the said Haight & Freese Company and others, Colt
and one. Edmonds were appointed temporary 'receivers of the
same corporation, "both original and as ancillaz to said decree
of the Circuit Court of the United. States for the District'of
Massachusetts." The order appointing receivers also contained
a clause enjoining the defendants, various other named persons
.and corporations, and all persons and corporations generally,.
from paying over or transferring'any of the money, property,
effects or assets of the corporation to any person. other than'
the receivers. On the same day that the receivers were appointed, but before the filing of the bill of complaint, an officer
.of the Haight & Freese Company.gave to Franklin Bieni an
attorney at law, a check drawn on the Colonial Bank of the city

Opinion of the ourt.

of New York, in which were on deposit funds of the company,
and later in the day Mr. Bien learned of the appointment of
the receivers and the terms of the order, The check was certi*fled on the following day,. was then endorsed'by Bien and cola third party. In June following, upon the
.ugh A
lected t
petition of the receivers) arule was issued requiring Mr. Bien
to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him
to pay to the receivers the'money thus collected on the check,
with interest. The application was heard upon affidavitsi and.
an order was issued by the circuit. judge requiring Mr. Bien
to pay the money to the receivers, with interest, within ten
days after. the service -of the order. Bien thereupon sued out
this writ of error. In addition to allowing *thewrit of error the
circuit .judge certified that the application was made "upon
the. ground that this [Circuit] court had no jurisdiction to make
the order as in said petition for appeal and assignment of errors
appears," and it was . further crtified "that the question of
jurisdiction was involved in making the order of May 29, 1906."
The alleged errors assigned are in substance that the Court
below had not .jurisdiction over the plaintiff in error or the
subject matter of the proceedings, 1, because the plaintiff in
error was not an officer of the Haight & Freese Company; 2,
.because the check was received prior to the filing of the bill of
complaint and the appointment of receivers; and 3,'because the
,right of the receivers to the fund could not bd determined in a
summary -proceeding, but' could only be adjudged in an action.
at law to recoVer the proceeds of the check.
It was also assigned as error that the plaintiff in error was.
deprived of a jury trial, contrary .to his rights under the Constitutionof the United States, and that the Circuit Court had
refused and denied his pplication "to compel the defendart
in error: to bring any action he- may be advised for the recovery
of the said sum of .two.thousand dollars," which denial operated
'to "deprive 'the plaintiff in error of'his property without-due
process of law as providedla0r by the Constitution and .laws of
..the United 'States."

In the brief of counsel it.
is further urged that the Circuit
-Court,-Was without-, jurisdiction to ".appoint..the receivers, the,.

contention being tat.the cas' presented by the bill was not
one cogniiable in a court+.of equity, but that the remedy of
the Complainant wa inan action atlkw.
The case will b disposed, of by our 'ralng upon a motion
which. hs been made to dismiss the writ of error for want of
jurisdiction in this court pver -the same.
Th.....The
writ of error.was applied for' and allowed upon the .ques'tion of the jurisdiction ofthe Circuit C6urt' By the first clause
:of- 5 of the -act of March 3, 1891,, c. 517; 26 Stat. 826,'827,
it is provided. that appeals or writs of error may be taken from
the District Courts or from the' existing Circuit Courts direct)
,to.,
this c6urt.in any case in which the jurisdiction of the court.
is-in issue; in such: cases: the questio of jurisdiction alone shall'
be -certified to -the 'Supreme Court - from the court below fpr
decision.". .The scope and meaning of this clause has: not infrequently 'been. the subject of, consideration, and, the pror'
'authorities are reviewed in Board oJ Trad v. 'Hammond Evator.

the jurisdicti6n, of .the.Circuit ..Court..in respect. to. its pdwer.
as.a court ol the.-United itates was not assailed either in.the.
assignment. of.errors or in "the.a.rgumentat baTr... The jurisdiction of the court was questioned merely in.respect to its general.
authority. as. a judicial . tribunal,.to entertain the summary:
proceeding against Bien, initiated by the rule, to show cause,
or its power as a court of equityto entertaini the suit
of Bowker
and afford hirh equitable relief, and we cannot, therefore, under
the clause of the'Judi'ciary Act above referred to, pass upon the
questions. asserting. a want .of juri.sdiction in the. Circuit Court.
As the writ of.error was allowed upon assignments claimed
t"o
present questions as to the jurisdiction of -the Circuit Court,
and the. circuit judge certified the question of jurisdiction,
the writ might well be treated as biinging up -only.jurisdictiona]
questions. Inasmuch, however, as the right to bring a case
di'rect to this court. exists when,constititional questions are
.raised and decided in the Circuit Court, we will briefly notice
the assignments not stated as jurisdictional, viz., that the
denial Of.a jury trial was an invasion of rights under the Constitution of the United States, and that .the refusal to'.compel
the receiver to bring an actionat law for the recovery of th'
two. thousand dollars. paid by the bank was a deprivation of.
Orolerty without due process of. law. The record does not
contain the bill of complaint upon which the court. made its
order ,appointing. receivers of and enjoining interference by
third parties with theassets of thHaight-& Freese Company.
It is. shown, .however, that that company, represented by
-Mr. Bien as its solicitor, moved to set aside the order as having been: "inadvertently granted, and among other.grounds
Stl t the court was .without,jurisdiction." This motion Was
denied: "'with
leave to,renew should the order in the Massa
chuietts District be vacated,". and such action by the court
appears to lve been acquiesced in by the Haight & Freese
Company. Even if it be, assumed, that the objection was
available to Bieni, no sufficient.reason has. been stated warranting us in.deciding that the Circuit Court acted without juris-

diction, and we must assume that the appointment of the'receivers and the making-of the injunction order was rightful.
As to the money collected on the check, the argument.at bar
on behalf of the plaintiff in error proceeded upon the manifestly
incorrect hypothesis that the delivery to Bien of the check
was the equivalent of the payment of the money ordered by
tlie check to be paid.
Reduced to its last analysis, the contention of this branch
of) the case is that a court of equity, which in the due exercise
of jurisdiction had, appointed receivers of the assets and proporty of a corporation and enjoined interference by others with
such property, was without power,- by summary process, after
due notice and opportunity to be heard, to compel a repayment by one who, with knowledge of the order of injunction
and in violation of its terms, took in satisfaction of an indebtedness from a debtor to the corporation, property forming part
of the assets of such corporation. We think the contention
and the assignments, of error based thereon are so manifestly
frivolous as to be utterly insufficient to serve as the foundation
for a writ of error.
It is unnecessary to pass upon various. other objections to
our .iurisdiction over the writ made on behalf of the defendant
in error, as it 'plainly results that the motion to dismiss must.
be granted, and our order. therefore is
