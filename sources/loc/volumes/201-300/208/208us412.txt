MULLER, PLAINTIF,e IN ERROR, v. THE STATE OF
OREGON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE, STATE OF OREGON.
No. 107.

Argued January 15, 1908.-Decided February 24, 1908.

The peculiar value of a written constitution is that it places, in unchanging
form, limitations upon legislative action, questions relating to which are
not settled by even a consensus of public opinion; but when the extent of
one of those limitations is affected by a question of fact which is debatable
and debated, a widespread and long continued belief concerning that fact
is worthy of consideration.
This court takes judicial cognizance of all matters of general knowledgesuch as the fact that woman's physical structure and the performance of
maternal functions place her at a disadvantage which justifies a difference
in legislation in regard to some of the burdens which rest upon her.
As healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical wellbeing of woman is an object of public interest. The regulation of her hours
of labor falls within the police power of the State, and a statute directed
exclusively to such regulation does not conflict with the due process or
equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The right of a State to regulate the working hours of women rests on the
police power and the right to preserve the health of the women of the
State, and is not affected by other laws of the State granting or denying
to women the same rights as to contract and the elective franchise as are
enjoyed by men.
While the general liberty to contract in regard to one's business and the sale
of one's labor is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment that liberty is
subject to proper restrictions under the police power of the State.
The statute of Oregon of 1903 providing that no female shall work in certain
establishments more than ten hours a day is not unconstitutional so far
as resjects laundries.

of Oregon limiting 'the 'hours of eir ?loyment of women, are
stated in the opinion.
Mr. William D. Fenton, with. whom Mr. Henry H. Gilfry
was on the brief, for plaintiff in error: .
Women, within the meaning of both the state and Federal
constitutions, are persons and citizens, and as such are entitled
to all the privileges and immunities therein provided, and are
- as competent to contract with reference to their labor as are
men. In re.Leach, 134 Indiana, 665; Minor v. Happerset, 21

Bank v. Leonard, 6 Oregon, 390; II. B. & C. Ann. Codes &
Statutes of Oregon, §§ 5244) 5250.
The right to labor or employ labor and to make contracts in
.respect thereto upon such terms as may be agreed upon, is
both a liberty and a property right, included in the constitutional guarantee that no person shall be deprived of life,
liberty or property without due process of law. Cooley's

prives the plaintiff in error and his employds of the right to
contract and be contracted with, and deprives them of the
right of private judgment in matters of individual concern, and
in a matter in no wise affecting the general welfare, health
and morals of the persons immediately concerned, or of the
general public. Cases cited supra and In re Jacobs, 98 N. Y.
98; People v. Gillson, 109 N. Y..389; Godcharles v. Wigeman,
113 Pa. St. 431, 437; Ramsey v. People, 142 Illinois, 380.
Conceding that the right to contract is subject to certain
limitations growing out of the duty which the individual owes
to society, the public, or to government, the power of the legislature to limit such right must rest upon some reasonable basis,
and cannot be arbitrarily exercised; Ritchie v. People, 155
Illinois, 98, 106; State v. Loomis, 115 Missouri, 307; Ex parte
Kuback, 85 California, 274; City of Cleveland v. Construction
Co., 67 Ohio St. 197, 218; State v. Goodwill, 33 W. Va. 179, 182;
Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 48, 57.
The police power, no matter how broad and extensive, is
limited and controlled by the provisions of organic law. In re
Jacobs, 98 N. Y. 98, 108; People v. Gillson, 109 N. Y. 389;
Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 11; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S.
661; Tiedeman on Lim. of Police Powers, §§ 3-86.
Women, *equally with men, are endowed with the fundamental and inalienable rights of liberty and property, and these
rights cannot be impaired or destroyed by legislative. action
under the pretense of exercising the police power of the State.
Difference in sex alone does not justify the destruction or impairment of these rights. Where, under the exercise of the
police power, such rights are sought to be restricted, impaired
or denied, it must clearly appear that the public health, safety
or welfare is involved. This statute is not declared to be a
health measure. The employments forbidden and -restricted
are not in fact or declared to be, dangerous to health or morals.

Argument for Defendant in Error.

153 N. Y. 188, 197; People v. Williams, 100 N. Y. Supp. 337;
People v. Williams, 101 ,N.Y. Supp. 562.
Mr. H. B. Adams and Mr. Louis D. Brandeis for defendant
in error. Mr; John Manning, Mr. A. M. Crawford, Attorney
General of the State of Oregon, and Mr. B.'E. Haney were on
the brief:
The legal rules applicable to this case are few and are well
established, namely:
The right to purchase or to'sell labor is a part of the "liberty"
protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution and this right to "liberty'? is, however, subject to
such reasonable restraint of action as the State may impose
in the exercise of the police pbwer for the protection of. health,
safety, morals and the general welfare. Lochner v. New York.
198-U. S. 45, 53, 67..
The mere assertion that a statute restricting "liberty" relates, though in a remote degree, to the' public health, safety
or welfare does not render it valid. The act must have a "real
or substantial relation tb the protection of the public health
and the public safety.". Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S.
11, 31. - It must have "a more direct relation, as a means to
an end, and the end itself must be appropriate and legitimate."
Lochner v. New York , 198'U, S.45, 56, 57, 61.'
While such a law will not be sustained if it has no real or
substantial relation to public health, safety or welfare, or that.
it is an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference'
with the right of the individual to his personal liberty or to
enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem
to him appropriate or necessary for the support of himself and
his family, if the end which the legislature seeks to accomplish be'one to which its power extends, and if. the means employed to that end, although not- the wisest or best, are yet'
not plainly and palpably unauthorized by law, then the court
cannot interfere . In other words when the validity of a
statute' is questioned, the burden of proof, so to speak, is

upon those who assail it. Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S.
45-68.
The validity of the Oregon statute must therefore be sustained
.Anless the court can find that there is no "fair ground, reasonable in and of itself, to say that there is material danger to the
public health (or safety), or to the health (or safety) of the
employds (or.to the general welfare), if. the hours of labor are
not curtailed. Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 61.
The Oregon statute was obviously enacted foi the purpose
of protecting the public health, safety, and welfare. Indeed it
declares: that as the female employds in the various establishments 'are not protected from overwork, an emergency is
hereby declared to exist.
...
The, facts of common knowledge of which the court may
take judicial notice establish, conclusively, that there is reasonable ground for holding that to permit women-in Oregon to
work in a "mechanical establishment, or factory, or laundry"
more than ten hours in one day is dangerous to the public
health, safety, morals or welfare. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S.
366; Jqacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11; Lochner v. New
York, 198 U. S. 481..
Mr.' Louis D. Brandeis also submitted a separate brief in
support of the constitutionality of the la. 1
MR. JUSTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court.

On February 19, 1903, the legislature of. the'State of Oregon
passed an act (Session Laws, 1903, p. 14$), the first section of
which is in these words:
"SEc. 1. That no female (shall) be employed in any mechanical establishment, 6r factory,, or laundry in this State
more than ten hours 'during any one"day. The hours of work.
may be so:arranged as to permit, the employment of females

OpinioiA of the Court.

at any time so that they shall not work more than ten hours
during the twenty-four hours of any one day."
Section 3 made a violation of the provisions of the prior sections a misdemeanor, subject to a fine of not less than $10 nor
more than $25. On September 18, 1905, an information was
filed in the Circuit Court of the State for the county of Multnomah, charging that the defendant "on the 4th day of September, A. D. 1905,'in the county of' Multnomah and State of
Oregon, then and there being the-owner of a laundry, known
*as the Grand Laundry, in the city of Portland, and the employer
of females therein, did then and there unlawfully permit and
suffer one Joe Haselbock, he, the said Joe Haselbock, .thenand
there being an overseer, superintendent and agent of said Curt
Muller, in the said Grand Laundry, to require a female, 6 wit,
one Mrs. E. Gotcher, to work more than ten hours in' said
laundry on said 4th day of September, A. D. 1905, contrary to
the statutes in such cases made and provided, and against the
*peace and dignity of the State of Oregon."
A trial resulted in a verdict against the defendant, who was
sentenced to pay a fine of $10. The Supreme Court of -,he State
affirmed the conviction, State v. Muller, 48 Oregon, 252, whereupon the case was brought here on writ of error.
The single question is the constitutionality of the statute
under which the defendant was' convicted so far as it affects
the work of a female in a laundry. 'That it does not conflict
with any provisions of the state constitution is settled by the
decision of the Supreme Court of the State. The contentions of
the defendant, now plaintiff in error, are thus stated in his brief:
"(1)' Because the statute attempts to prevent persons, sui
juris, from making their own contracts, and thus violates the
provisionO of the Fourteenth Amendment, as follows:
"'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the. privileges or immunities of citizens of the United. States;
nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without'due process of law;. nor deny to any person within.
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'

208 U. 1.

"(2) Because the statute does not apply equally to all persituated, and is class legislation.
sons
"(3)similarly
The statute
is not a valid exercise of the police power.
The kinds of work proscribed are not unlawful, nor are they
0leclared to be immoral or dangerous to the public health; nor
can such a law be sustained on the ground that it is designed
to protect women on account of their sex. There is no necessary
or reasonable connection between the limitation prescribed
'by the act and the public health, safety or welfare."
It is the law of Oregon that women, whether married%or
simgle,. have, equal contractual and personal rights with men.
As said by Chief Justice Wolverton, in First National Bank v.
Leonard, 36 Oregon, 390, 396, after a review of the various
statutes of the State upon the subject:
"We may therefore say with perfect confidence that, with
these three sections upon the statute book, the wife can deal,
not only with her separate property, acquired from whatever
source, in the same manner as her husband can with property
belonging to, him, but that she may make contracts and incur
liabilities, and the Same may be enforced against her, the same
as if she were a lemme sole. There is now no residuum of civil
disability resting upon her which is not recognized as existing
against the, husband. The current runs steadily and strongly
in the direction of the emancipation of the wife, and the policy,
as disclosed by all recent legislation upon the subject in this
State, is to place her upon *thesame footing as if she were a
Jemme sole, not only with respect to her separate property, but
as it affects her right to make binding contracts; and the. most
natural -corollary to the situation is that the remedies for the
enforcement of liabilities incurred are made co-extensive and
co-equal with such enlarged conditions."
It thus appears that, putting to one side the elective franchise, in the matter of personal and contractual rights they,
stand. on the same plane as the other sex. Their rights in these
respects can no more be infringed than theequal rights of their
brothers. We held in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, that

a law.providing that no laborer shall be required or permitted
to work in a bakery more than sixty hours in a week or ten
hours in a day was' not as to men a legitimate exercise of the
police power of the, State, but an unreasonable,. unnecessary
and arbitrary interference with the right' and liberty of the
individual to contract in relation to his'labor, and as such was
in conflict with, and void under, the Federal ConStitution.
That decision is invoked by plaintiff in error as decisive of the
question before us. But this assumes that the difference between the sexes does not justify a different rule respecting a
restriction of the hours of labor.
In patent cases counsel are apt to open the argument with
a discussion of the state of the art. It may not be amiss, in
the present case, before examining the constitutional question,
to notice the course of legislation as well as expressions of opinion from other than judicial sources. In the brief filed by Mr.
Louis D. Brandeis, for the defendant in error, is a very copious
collection of all these matters, an epitome of which is found in
the margin.'

or another upon the hours of labor that may be required of women: Massachusetts: chap. 221, 1874, Rev. Laws 1902, chap. 106, § 24; Rhode Island:

Opinion of the Court.

208 U. S.

While there have been but few decisions bearing directly upon
the question, the following sustain the constitutionality of
such legislation: Commonwealth v. Hamilton Mjg. Co., 120
Massachusetts, 383; Wemrham v. State, 65 Nebraska, 394, 400,
406; State v. Buchanan, 29 Washington, 602; Commonwealth
v. Beatty, 15 Pa. Sup. Ct. 5, 17; against them is the case of
Rikchie v. People, 155 Illinois, 98.
The legislation and opinions referred to in the margin may
not be, technically speaking, authorities, and in 'them is little
or no discussion of the constitutional question presented to us
for determination, yet they are significant of a widespread
belief that woman's physical structure, and the functions she
performs in consequence thereof, justify special legislation re•stricting or qualifying the*conditions under which she should
be permitted to toil. Constitutional questions, it is true, are
not settled by even a consensus of present public opinion, for
it is the peculiar value of a written constitution that it places
in- unchanging forin limitations upon legislative action, and
thus gives a permanence and stability to popular government
which otherwise would be lacking. At the same time, when a

Then follow extracts from over ninety reports of committees, bureaus of
statistics' commissioners of hygiene, inspectors of. factories, both in this.

for women' primarily becaus' of their special physical organization. The
matter is discussed in these reports in different.aspects,-but all agree as to
th- Janger. It would of course take too much space to give these reports in
detail:' Following them are extracts from similar reports discussing the
general benefits of short hours from an economic aspect of the question.
In many of these reports individual instances are given tending to support.
the general conclusion. Perhaps the general scope and character of all these
reports may be summed up in what an inspector.for Hanover says: "The

reasons for the reduction of the working day to ten hours-(a) the physical
organization of women, (b) her maternal functions, (c) the rearing and
education of the children, (d) the maintenance of the home-are allso

important and so far reaching that the need for such reduction need hardlybe discussed."

Opinion of the Court.

-which a special constitutional limitation goes is affected by

the truth in respect to that fact, a widespread and long continued belief concerning it is.worthy of consideration. We take
judicial cognizance of all matters of general knowledge.
It is undoubtedly true, as more than once declared by this
court, that the general right to contract in relation to one's
business is part of the liberty of the individual, protected by
the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution; yet
it is equally *ell settled that this liberty is not absolute*and
extending to all contracts, and that a State may, without conflicting with the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment,
restrict in many 'respects the individual's power. of contract.
Without stopping to discuss at length the extent to which a
State may act in this respect, we refer to the following cases
in which the question has been considered: Allgeyer'v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578; Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366; Lochner v.
New York, 198 U. S. 4 .
That woman's physical structure and the performance of
maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle
for subsistence is obvious. This .is
especially true wheni the
burdens ofjnotherhood are upon her. .Even when they are not,'
by abundant testimony of the medical fraternity continuance
for a -long time on her feet at work,' repeating this from day to

day, tends to injurious effects upon the body, and as healthy
m others are essential to vigorous offspring, the physical well'being of woman becomes an object of.public interest. and care.
in order to preserve the strength and vigor ofthe race.
Still again, history discloses'the fact that woman -has always
been dependent upon man. He established his control -at the
outset by superior physical strength, and. this control in various
forms, with diminishing intensity,.has continued to the present.
As minors,- though not to the same extent, she has been. looked
upon in the courts as needing especial care, that her rights may
be preserved. Education:was long denied her, and while now

consequent increase of capacity for business affairs it is still
true' that in the struggle for subsistence she is not an equal.
competitor with her brother. 'Though limitations upon _personal and contraotual rights may be removed by legislation,
there is that in .her disposition and habits of life which will
operate against a full assertion of those rights. She will still..
be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary. to
secure a real equality of right. Doubtless there are individual
exceptions, arid there are many -respects in which she has an
advantage over him; but looking at it from the viewpoint of
the'effort to maintain an independent position in life,, she is
not upon an equality. Differentiated by these matters. from.
the other sex, she is properly placed in a class by herself,: and
legislation designed for 'her protection may besustained, even
whenlike legislation is not necessary for men and "could not be
sustained. It is impossible to close one's eyes to the fact that
she still looks to her brother and depends upon him. Even
though all restrictions on political,, personal and contractual
rights were taken away, and she stood, so far as statutes are'
concerned, upon an absolutely equaplane with him, it would
still be true that she is so constituted that she will rest upon,:
and look to him for protection; that her physical structure and
a proper discharge of her maternal functions-having in' view
not merely her own health, but the well-Ueing of the.race'justify. legislation to protect her from the greed as well as the
passion of man. The limitations which this statute places upon'
her 'contractual powers, .upon her right to agree with her employer as to the' time she shall labor, are not imposed solely.
for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.. Many
words' cannot make this plainer. The two sexes differ in.struc-.
'ture' of body, in the functions to, be performned by each .in the

reliance which enables one to assert full rights,' and in the capacity to.maintain the struggle'for subsistence. This difference

justifies a difference in legislation and upholds that which is
desiged to compensate for some of the burdens whih,rest
upon her.
We have-not referred in this discussion to the denial of the
elective franchise in the State of Oregon, for while it may dis-.
close a lack of political equality in all things with her brother,
that is not of itself decisive. -The reason runs deeper, and rests
in the inherent difference between the two sexes, and in the
different functions in life which they perform.
For. these reasons, and without questioning in any respect
the decision in'Lochnerv. New York, we are of the opinion that
it cannot be adjudged, that the, act in question is in conflict
with the Frdleral Constitution, so far as it respects the work
of a female' in a laundry, and the judgment of the Supreme
Court of Oregon is
