BRAXTON COUNTY COURT v. THE STATE OF WEST
VIRGINIA ex rel. THE STATE TAX COMMISSIONERS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEAL$ OF THE STATE OF
WEST VIRGINIA.
No. 124.

Submitted January 14. 108.-Decided January 27, 108.

Speaking generally, and subject to the rule that no State can set at naught
* the provisions of the National Constitution, the regulation of municipal
corporations is-peculiarly within state control, the legislature determining tOe taxing body, the taxing districts, and the limits of taxation.
NotWithstanding thiat plaintiff in error's charge of unconstitutionality of a
state statute may not be frivolous, in order to give this court jurisdiction
to review the action of the state court sustaining the statute the question
must be raised in this court by one adversely affected by the decision and
whose interest is personal and not of an. official nature; Smith, Auditor,
v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138.
A county court of West Virginia has no personal interest in the amount
of: tax levy made by it which will give this court jurisdiction to review
at its instance the decision of the highest court of that State determining that the levy is excessive, even ,though the basis of. request for review is the ground that the reduction of the assessment leaves the county
unable for lack of funds to fulfill- the obligations of its contracts.
60 Wesb Virginia, 339, affirmed,

7 and.8, article 10, of the West Virginia constitution of 1872 pr.ohibit the county authorities, except in certain.
specified cases,, from, levying taxes in, excess. of ninety-five
cents per $100 valuation. In. 1904 the valuation of property
in Braxton County was. $2,799,604. -The state legislature, at

Statement of the Case.

208 U.S.

an extraordinary session in 1904 and the regular session of
1905, changed the statute law in respect to taxation, largely
remodelling the entire tax system. One of the objects of such
legislation was to secure a moie correct valuation of property.
In 1906, under this new legislation, the assessed value of the
property in Braxton County was $10,195,301, nearly four
times the amount: of the assessment in 1904. In view of an
expected increase in valuation the-legislature enacted, chapter
48 of the acts of 1905 (Code of West Va., 1906, § 29, chap. 39),
by which it was provided that no county court should, in the
year 1906, assess or levy taxes which should exceed by more
than seven per cent the aggregate amount of taxes levied by
it in the year 1904. The levy made in the county of Braxton
in 1904 of ninety-five cents on the $100 valuation produced
the sum of $26,596.23, subject, of course, to such minor reductions -as might come from delinquencies and exonerations.
Therefore, under the act of 1905, the amount which the county
court could levy in 1906 was the $26,596.23 plus an addition
of not to .exceed seven per cent, or $1,861.73, making.a total
of $28,457.96. To raise this amount a levy of not to exceed
twenty-eight cents on each $100 was sufficient. The county
court, however, made a levy of sixty-five cents on every $00,
and caused it to be entered upon the records of the court. Such
levy of sixty-five cents would produce the sum of $66,269.45,
more than double the amount which was authorized- under
t1e legislation of 1905. Thereupon the state tax commissioner
and certain residents and taxpayers of Braxton 'County applied to the Supreme Court of the. State for. a. mandamus to
compel the county' court to change that assessment to conform to the requirements of the act of 1905.. The county court
made answer and return to the' alternative writ of mandamus,
pleading that 'the amount necessary during the current fiscal
year to pay the necessary expenses, discharge the county debts
and liabilities payable during that year was'at least $57,146,
not includingan amount for interest and sinking fund of certain.raiiroad blnds, theretofore legally issued by the county.

In other words, it may be said, in a general way, that the defense of the county court was that the sum authorized to be
levied by the act of 1905 was insufficient to meet the ordinary
expenses of the county, pay .the interest, and provide a sinking fund for outstanding bonds. It was pleaded specifically
that at the time these railroad bonds were issued there was not
only. no restriction upon the power of the county court to levy
taxes for, payment of the principal and interest thereof, but,
on the contrary, that the general statutory law in force required the county to levy a tax in amount sufficient to pay
the annual interest and provide a sinking fund. It was contended that these provisions entered into and became a part
of the contract with the bondholders,, and that the restrictions
made by the act of 1905 worked an impairment of the obligation of the contract, and hence it was in conflict with '§10
of Article f of the Federal Constitution.
The *Supreme Court of Appeals issued the mandamus as
.prayed for, -whereupon the defendants brought the case here
on error. State ex rel. Dillon v. County Court, 60 W. Va. 339.
Mr. George E.- Price for plaintiffs in errorf
This case is not governed by the cases of Clark v. Kansas
City, 176 U. S. 114; Lampasas v. Bell, 180.U. S. 276; Wellington, Petitioner, 16 Pick. 87, 96; Smith, Auditor of Marion
County, v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138, holding that the objection
made to the constituionality of an act must be by a party
whose rights it does affect,' and who has legal interest in defeating it.
The county court of. Braxton County has a right to raise the
question whether it was bound to obey the act of 1905 in this
case. It is interested in'this matter as a party to the contracts, the obligations of which air impaired by this statute;
it is a corporation. See Code, chap. 36, §§ 1, 4, 16, 17 and 43..
The county court is a party to all contracts, debts and
obligations of its county.. It stands for -the county. When
bonds are Issued they. are made in its nme'and issued by it.

:208 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

This was the case with tle railroad bonds in question. By
these bonds the county court expressly agreed to pay certain
sums of money at certain timneb and in a certain way, and it
* certainly has a deep interest in seeing that it is not deprived
of the power to carry.out its agreement.
The people of the county, the taxpayers, are certainly parties
to the contracts of the county. It is they who pay the county's
debts and discharge its obligations. If after they have contracted a debt in their aggregate capacity as a county, a law
is passed that impairs its obligations, they have as much right
as the creditor to object'to it and to test its validity in the
courts. This must be done, if at all, in the name and by means
of the county court; their representative. Clark v. County
Court, 55 W. Va. 278, 285. "While one or a few could bring
such a suit, the, burden should not be placed on one or a few
which ought to be.borne by all. And see Board of.Liquidation
v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 622.
The obligation of a contract consists in its binding
force
on the party who made it. This depends on the laws in force
when it is made. These laws are necessarily referred to in all
contracts as forming part of them as the measure of the obligation to perf6rm them and as creating the xight acquired
by the other parties to compel performance. The obligation
does not inhere and subsist in the contract proprio vigore, but
in the law applicable to the contract. Ogden v. Saunders, 12

Argument for Defendants in Error.

208 U. S.

The constitutional provisions and the laws which were in
force in West Virgina when the railroad bonds of Braxton
County were issued; not only authorized, but required the
county court to provide for the collection of a direct annual
tax sufficiefit to pay annually the interest on said bonds, and
the principal thereof -within and not exceeding thirty-four
years. Const. of West Virginia, Article 10, § 8. The law
governing the county court in such a case is § 59, c. 54 of
'the Code.
Mr. W. Mollohan for defendants in error:
The county court of Braxton County under the constitution and statute 'law of the State of West Virginia, as construed by the highest court of that State, is a mere fiscal or
administrative board for the management of county affairs
and has no personal or direct interest in claims against the
county owned or held by third persons, such as will authorize
it to prosecute a writ of error in this case, nor under such
constitution, statutes and decisions has it the right to stand
in judgment for such third parties and present for decision
the question whether or not any given statute 'violates their,
contract, rights against the county.
Even if this court should be of opinion that it is not bound
to accept the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of
West Virginia as to the powers of the county court to stand
in judgment for its creditors and present for decision the
question of. alleged impairment of creditors' contracts, yet
under the decisions of this court the county court of Braxton
County had no, such interest as would enable it to prosecute
a writ of error to this court. Henderson v. Tennessee, 10 How.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTIcE BREWER, after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.'
Speaking generally, thWe regulation of municipal corporations is a matter peculiarly within the domain of state control.
The taxing body, the taxing district and the limits of taxation are determinable by the legislature of the State. Kelly
v. Pittsburgh, 104 U. S.78; Forsyth v. .Hammond, 166"U. S.
506, and cases cited in the opinion; Williams v. Eggleston, 170
U. S. 304, 310; 1 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (4th ed.,
p. 52), and following. True, the legislature may sometimes, by
restrictive legislation in respect to taxes, seek to prevent the
payment by a municipality of its contract obligations, and
in such a case the courts will enforce the protective clauses
of the Federal Constitution against any state legislation impairing the obligation of a contract. In other words, no State
-can in respect to. any matter set at naught the paramount
provisions of the National Constitution:
Again, that the act of the State is charged to be in violation of the National Constitution, and-that the charge is not
frivolous, does not always -give this court jurisdiction to review the, judgment of a state court. The party raising the
question of constitutionality and invoking our jurisdiction
must be interested in and affected adversely by the decision
of the state court sustaining the act, and the interest must
be of a personal and not of an official nature. Clark v. Kansas
City, 176 U, S. 114, 118; Lampasas v. Bell, 180 U. S.276, 283;
Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138, 148. 'Inthe latter case suit
was brought in the state-court against a county auditor to test
the constitutionality of the exemption law of Indiana, which
was claimed to.be in conflict with the Federal Constitution.
The A:ecision of the state court having been in favor of the act,
the auditor brought the case here. Mr. Justice Brown, delivering the opinion of the court, cited the following cases:
Tyler v. Registration Court Judges,. 179 U. S. 405; Clark v.
Kansas City, 176, U. S.114; Turpin v. Lemon, 187 U. S.51;

Lampasas v. Bell, 180 U. S. 276; Ludeling v. Chaffee, 143 U. S.
301; Giks v. Ltte, 134 U. S. 645; and said (191 U. S. 148):
"These authorities control the present case. It is evident
that- the auditor had no personal interest in the litigation.
He had certain duties as a public officer to perform. The performance of those duties was of no personal benefit to him.
Their non-performance Was equally so. He neither gained nor
lost anything by invoking the advice of the Supreme Court

'asto the. proper action he should take. He was testing the
constitutionality of the law purdy in the interest of third per-

sons, viz.,, the taxpayers, and in, this particular case the case
is analogous to that of Caffrey v. Oklahoma, 177 U. S. 346. We
think the interest of an appellant in this court should be a

personal and not an official interest, and that the defendant,
having sought the advice of the courts of his own.State in his
official capacity, should be content to abide by their decisions."
These decisions control this 'ese and compel a dismissal of
the writ of error, and

It is so or&red.

A revenue statute containing provisions of a highly penal nature should
be construed in a fair and -reasonable manner,.and, notwithstanding plain
and unambiguous language, provisions for the prevention of evasion of
taxation, which naturally are applicable to taxable articles only, will not
be held applicable to articles not taxable, *wholly harmless, and not used

opportunities to defraud the revenue.
