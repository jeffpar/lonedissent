THE UNITED STATES v. FLANNERY ET AL.,
EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES J.
FLANNERY, DECEASED.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 527.

Argued January 12, 1925.-Decided April 13, 1925.

1. The Revenue Act of 1918 provided that net income should include "gains" derived from sales or dealings in property, §§ 212
(a), and 213 (a); that there should be allowed as deductions
"losses" sustained during the taxable year "incurred in any transaction entered into for profit," § 214 (a); and that "for the purpose of ascertaining the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale
or other disposition of property . . . the basis shall be-(1) In the
case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the fair market price or value of such property as of that date; and (2) In
the case of property acquired on or after that date, the cost
thereof." § 202 (a). Held:
(a) That the provisions of the act in reference to the gains derived
and the losses sustained from the sale of property acquired before
March 1, 1913, were correlative, and that whatever effect was intended to be given to the market value of property on that date
in determining taxable gains, a corresponding effect was intended
to be given to such market value in determining deductible losses;
(b) That the Act of 1918 imposed a tax and allowed a deduction
to the extent only that an actual gain was derived or an actual loss
sustained from the investment, and the provision in reference to
the market value on March 1, 1913, was applicable only where
there was such an actual gain or loss, that is, that this provision
was merely a limitation upon the amount of the actual gain or loss
that would otherwise have been taxable or deductible. Goodrich
v. Edwards, 255 U. S. 527; Walsh v. Brewster, Id. 536. P. 100.

country should not be disturbed except upon the most cogent
reasons. P. 105.

MR.

JUSTICE SANFORD

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
James J. Flannery bought, prior to March 1, 1913, certain corporate stock for less than $95,175. Its market
value on March 1, 1913 was $116,325. He sold it in 1919
for $95,175, that is, for more than cost. He died in
March, 1920. The executors of his estate in returning his
income for the year 1919 deducted, as a loss, the difference between the market value of the stock on March 1,
1913, and the price received. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue disallowed the loss claimed, and an additional tax was assessed. The executors paid this under
protest, and thereafter, a claim for refund having been
denied, brought this action in the Court of Claims to recover the amount paid. Judgment was rendered in their
favor. 59 Ct. Cls. 719.
The question presented is whether, under the income
tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1918,1 a deductible
loss was sustained by the sale of the stock in 1919 for more
than it had cost, by reason of the fact that on March 1,
'Act of Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, Title II, 40 Stat. 1057.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

1913, between the dates of purchase and sale, it had a
market value greater than the sale price.
This Act provided that net income should include
"gains" derived from sales or dealings in property,
§§ 212 (a), 213 (a); that there should be allowed as deductions "losses" sustained during the taxable year "incurred in any transaction entered into for profit ",
§ 214 (a); and that "for the purpose of ascertaining the
gain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of property
. .
the basis shall be-(1)
In the case of property acquired before March 1, 1913, the
fair market price or value of such property as of that
date; and (2) In the case of property acquired on or after
that date, the cost thereof .
." § 202 (a).
The United States contends that under § 214 (a) there
was no deductible loss whatever unless the taxpayer had
sustained an actual "loss" in the entire transaction by
selling the property for less than it had cost; and that the
effect of § 202 (a) was merely that if such an actual loss
had been sustained in selling property acquired before
March 1, 1913, only so much thereof could be deducted as
was sustained after the latter date, that is, the difference
between the market value on that date and the sale price.
The executors contend, on the other hand, that § 202 (a)
established the market value of such property on March
1, 1913, as the sole basis for ascertaining the loss sustained, without regard to its actual cost; and that if such
market value was higher than the sale price, this conclusively determined that there had been a deductible
"loss" in the transaction, and fixed the amount thereof
at the difference between the market value on that date
and the sale price.
It is clear, in the first place, that the provisions of the
Act in reference to the gains derived and the losses sustained from the sale of property acquired before March 1,
1913, were correlative, and that whatever effect was intended to be given to the market value of property on

UNITED STATES v. FLANNERY.

Opinion of the Court.

that date in determining taxable gains, a corresponding
effect was intended to be given to such market value in
determining deductible losses. This conclusion is unavoidable under the specific language of § 202 (a) estab.lishing one and the same basis for ascertaining both gains
and losses.
-Taking this as a premise, we think that the question of
determining taxable gains is concluded, in accordance with
the contention of the Government, by the decisions of this
Court in Goodrich v. Edwards, 255 U. S. 527, and Walsh
v. Brewster, 255 U. S. 536. These cases, which were decided in 1921, arose under the income tax provisions of
the Revenue Act of 1916. That Act provided, as did
the Act of 1918, that the "gains" derived from sales or
dealings in property should be included in net income3 ,
and also that the losses actually sustained in transactions
entered into for profit should be allowed as deductions.'
In the Act of 1916, however, the provisions for the ascertainment of the gains derived and losses sustained from
the sale of property were not contained, as in the Act of
1918, in one provision, but in separate clauses of the same
tenor and effect as the combined provision in the Act of
1918. -Section 2 (c) provided that: "For the purpose of
ascertaining the gain derived from the sale or other disposition of property . . . acquired before" March 1,
1913, "the fair market price or value of such propertyas
of" March 1, 1913, "shall be the basis for determining
the amount of such gain derived." The correlative clause
relating to the ascertainment of loss was in precisely the
same language except that the words" the loss" and "loss
sustained" were used instead of the words "the gain
and "gain derived." 5

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

In Goodrich v. Edwards, supra, in the second transaction involved, the taxpayer had acquired in 1912 certain
corporate stock of the then value of $291,600. Its market value on March 1, 1913, was only $148,635.50. He
sold it in 1916 for $269,346.25, being $22,253.75 less than
its value when acquired, but $120,710.75 more than its
value on March 1, 1913. A tax was assessed on the latter
amount, which was sustained by the trial court. The
Government confessed error in this judgment. After reciting this fact and setting forth the pertinent provisions
of the Act, this court, in reversing the judgment, said:
"It is . . . very plain that the statute imposes the
income tax on the proceeds of the sale of personal property to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom
by the vendor, and we therefore agree with the Solicitor
General that since no gain was realized on this investment by the plaintiff in error no tax should have been
assessed against him. Section 2(c) is applicable only
where a gain over the original capital investment has been
realized after March 1, 1913, from a sale or other disposition of property."
This case was followed by Walsh v. Brewster, supra.
In the first transaction there involved the taxpayer had
purchased bonds in 1899 for $191,000, which he sold in
1916 for the same amount. Their market value on March
1, 1913, was $151,845. A tax was assessed on the difference between the latter amount and the selling price,
namely, $39,155. This tax was held invalid, under the
authority of Goodrich v. Edwards, on the specific ground
that "the owner of the stock did not realize any gain
on his original investment by the sale in 1916." In the
second transaction involved the taxpayer had purchased
certain bonds in 1902 and 1903 for $231,300, which he
sold in 1916 for $276,150. Their market value on March
1Z 1913, was $164,480. A tax was assessed upon the difference between the selling price and the market value of

UNITED STATES v. FLANNERY.

Opinion of the Court.

the bonds on March 1, 1913. It was held, however, that
"since the gain of the taxpayer was only the difference
between his investment of $231,300 and the amount realized by the sale, $276,150," under the authority of Goodrich v. Edwards, "he was taxable only on $44,850," the
difference between the purchase and sale prices.
These decisions are equally applicable to the Act of
1918. There is no difference in substance between the
language of the two Acts in respect to the ascertainment
of the gain derived or loss sustained from the sale of property acquired before March 1, 1913; and the correlative
nature of these two provisions is emphasized in the Act
of 1918 by their combination in one and the same sentence. As it was held in these decisions that the Act
of 1916 imposed a tax to the extent only that gains were
derived from the sale, and that the provision as to the
market value of the property on March 1, 1913, was applicable only where a gain had been realized over the
original capital investment, so we think it should be held
that the Act of 1918 imposed a tax and allowed a deduction to the extent only that an actual gain was derived
or an actual loss sustained from the investment, and that
the provision in reference to the market value on March
1, 1913, was applicable only where there was such an actual gain or loss, that is, that this provision was merely
a limitation upon the amount of the actual gain or loss
that would otherwise have been taxable or deductible.
We cannot sustain the contention that the decision in
Goodrich v. Edwards is not entitled to controlling weight
in the matter of deductible losses because of the Government's confession of error, or because it involved the question of taxable gains, as to which it is said, that under
a different construction of the Act a grave constitutional
question would have arisen which could have no application to the question of deductible losses. The decision
shows that it was not based on the confession of error or

on any constitutional question, but upon the conclusion
that, as a matter of construction, it was "very plain"
that the statute imposed a tax upon the proceeds of sales
"to the extent only that gains are derived therefrom by
the vendor."
The language of the opinion is specific
and unambiguous; it embodied the reasoned judgment of
the court as to the proper construction of the Act; and it
applies equally to the construction of the similar provisions of the Act of 1918, relating to gains and losses
alike.
This was recognized by the Treasury Department,
which promptly amended its former Regulations by incorporating therein "the rule announced by the Supreme
Court in the cases of Goodrich v. Edwards and Walsh v.
Brewster respecting the basis for the determination of
taxable gains or deductible losses in the case of property
acquired prior to March 1, 1913, and sold or disposed of
subsequent thereto." 23 T. D. 763, 764. To the same
effect is the opinion thereafter given to the Secretary of
the Treasury by the Attorney General in reference to
taxable gains and deductible losses under both of the
Acts. 33 Op. Atty. Gen. 291. And, it may be noted, a
like construction has been independently given by the
courts of New York, without reference to any constitu6 It distinctly appeared from the Solicitor General's brief that the
confession of error was not made because of any constitutional question, to which he made only an incidental reference, but because he
was "forced to the conclusion" that, as a matter of construction of
the Act, it was clear that it imposed a tax only on the "gains" derived
from the sale of property, and that § 2(c) could have "no application until it is first ascertained, by comparing the purchase and
selling prices, that there had been an actual gain." And this was
followed by the statement that in the Governinent's view the similar
provision relating to losses must be construed in the like manner,
"that is, it must first be ascertained by comparing the purchase
and selling price that a loss on the entire transaction has been
sustained."

Opinion of the Court.

tional question, to the Income Tax Law of that State,
in which the provisions relating to gains derived and
losses sustained from the sale of property, are a substantial transcript of those of the Act of 1918, except that
January 1, 1919, is substituted for Mfarch 1, 1913; this
construction being embodied in a series of decisions, the
first of which, relating to taxable gains, was written
before those in Goodrich v. Edwards and Walsh v. Brewster were announced. People ex rel. Klauber v. Wendell,
196 App. Div. 827, affirmed, without opinion, 232 N. Y.
549;' People ex rel. Keim v. Wendell, 200 App. Div. 388;
Re Application of Bush, 206 App. Div. 800.
It is unnecessary to consider in detail, as in a matter
of first impression, various contentions urged in behalf
of the executors in respect to the construction that should
be given to the provisions of the Act of 1918 in reference
to deductible losses. For the reasons stated we think
that the question should be resolved according to the
earlier decisions; and nothing has been suggested which
disposes us to depart from them now. Decisions affecting the business interests of -the country should not be
disturbed except for the most cogent reasons. National
Bank v. Whitney, 103 U. S. 99, 102.
Since Flannery sustained no actual loss in the transaction, in question, having sold the stock for more than it
had cost, his executors were not-entitled to the deduction
which they claimed- because it was .sold. at less than its
market value on March .1,
1913..
The judgment of -the Court of Claims is accordingly
.

Reversed.
