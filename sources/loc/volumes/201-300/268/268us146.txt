STANDARD OIL COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY v.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY AND JAMES C.
DAVIS, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF RAILROADS.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 197. Argued January 19, 1925.--Decided April 20, 1925.
1. The Federal Control Act did not authorize an action in tort by
the owner of a vessel against the Director General of Railroads for
her loss through collision while operated by the Director General
P. 154.
2. Where the Director General, -under his contract with the owner
for the use and upkeep of transportation properties taken over
under the Federal Control Act, made a settlement including an
allowance for a vessel lost by collision during operation by the
Director General, held that the common law rule that one who
accepts satisfaction from one of two joint tort-feasors can not
recover from the other was inapplicable to extinguish the claim of
the owner against the owner of the other vessel in pending limitation of liability proceedings to which both owners and the Director
General were parties. Id.
3. Upon an appeal in admiralty there is a trial de novo opening the
whole case, so that a party is not bound by the decree below
through failure to join in the appeal. P. 155.
4. In the absence of a market value, such as is established by contemporaneous sales of like property in the ordinary way of business, the damages to which the injured party is entitled in admiralty
for the loss of a vessel is that amount which, considering all the
circumstances, probably could have been obtained for her on the
date of the collision-the sum. that in all probability would have
resulted from fair negotiations between an owner willing to sell
and a purchaser desiring to buy. P. 155.

5. Cost of reproduction as of the date of valuation is evidence to be
considered but neither that, nor that less depreciation, is the measure or the sole guide; value is the thing to be found, and there
should be a reasonable judgment of this based on a proper
consideration of all relevant facts. P. 156.
6. In view of changed prices, held that original cost of a vessel was
not a useful guide to her value when lost. P. 157.
292 Fed. 560, affirmed.

CERTIORARI to a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals modifying a decree of the District Court (266 Fed.
570; 285 id. 617) in proceedings for limitation of liability, in admiralty. The District Court found that both
the petitioner's vessel and that of the Southern Pacific
Company were at fault, and fixed the damages of the
latter. The Circuit- Court of Appeals found petitioner's
vessel alone at fault and increased the damages. For
preliminary proceedings in this Court, see 263 U. S. 681,
696; 265 U. S. 569.

for petitioner.
The settlement made between the Director General of
Railroads and the Southern Pacific Company, by payment to the latter of the value of the Proteus in exchange
for a release, constituted a satisfaction of the claim of
the Southern Pacific Company in respect of the loss of
the Proteus. Any allowance that can now be made herein
for the loss of the Proteus can only be for a payment
to the Director General of such an amount, not exceeding the amount thus paid by him in settlement, as will
represent the value of the Proteus.
When two tort-feasors by their concurrent negligence
have caused an injury to a third person, they are jointly
and severally liable to him under the salutary doctrine
laid down in the overwhelming majority of the courts
of this country. The Atlas, 93 U. S. 302, at page 318;

There is not any doubt that, under the law as laid down
by this Court, the Southern Pacific Company, as the
innocent owner, could have sued either the Standard Oil
Company or the Director General for the negligent sinking of the Proteus and recovered full damages from either
tort-feasor, or it could have sued them jointly and recovered a moiety of its damages from each in the first instance, with a right over against the other tort-feasor for
any deficiency not paid by the respondent against whom
execution first issued. But once it had received from one
of the tort-feasors full satisfaction for its loss, as it has
done here, it could not pursue the other tort-feasor for
further damages for the excellent reason that it would
not have any cause of action left. The Beaconsfield, 158

Austriaca, 248 U. S. 9; The John Twohy, 255 U. S. 77.
We must look, therefore, at the facts, as now developed on
the new evidence taken in this Court. Now that the
Southern Pacific Company has been cut out of the case
by the satisfaction of its claim, the only question left is
what allowance the Director General should have in the
collision adjustment in respect of the Proteus. The Director General did not appeal and, therefore, we submit,
cannot be allowed more thhn the District Court allowed
as the value of the Proteus. Cf. The Beaconsfield, 158
U. S. 303, 310. Certainly there is not any question but
that the largest claim which he can now possibly make
is for reimbursement to the extent of the amount which
he had paid to his bailor in settlement of his contract
obligation to make the bailor whole. Cf. Vermilye v.
Adams Express Co. 21 Wall. 138.
The rule of damage applied by the Circuit Court of Appeals is erroneous in that it is based on an arbitrary formula, the two factors of which are a speculative reproduction cost., and an uncertain depreciation rate; which operates to exclude other material factors in arriving at fair
valuation. The proper rule is that adopted by the District
Court, and by the Commissioner, whereby, in the absence
of a provable market value, all other relevant facts are
considered in determining the measure of the loss. There
was not any market value for the Proteus at the time
of her loss. Gulf Refining Co. v. United States, 58 Ct.
Cls. 559. The burden of proof to establish the loss rested
on the Proteus interests (Southern Pacific Company and
Director General of Railroads). The Conqueror, 166
U. S. 110; Sedgwick on Damages, 9th ed. Vol. 1, p. 181.
The Circuit Court of Appeals based its valuation squarely
and exclusively on the reproduction and depreciation
theory. The factor of "cost of reproduction" which was
taken to be $1,750,000, is highly speculative and excessive.
The second factor, that of "depreciation," which the

Circuit Court of Appeals assumed to be two and a
half per cent. per year, was also unreasonable and unduly advantageous to the respondents, and its acceptance greatly enhanced the result obtained by the formula, and to the disadvantage of the petitioner. A rate
of five per cent. of the book value (for each year) as
depreciation, was held to be a reasonable allowance for
deduction from value, in the case of San Francisco &
PortlandSS. Co. v. Scott, Collector, 253 Fed. 854; United
States v. Standard Oil Co. 258 Fed. 696; The Anhauac,
295 Fed. 346; The Harmonides, 1903 Prob. Div. 1.
The application of the reproduction and depreciation
method so exclusively is not supported by the weight of
authorities. The cases show a wide latitude in considering all elements which bear on the question of the measure
of the loss under the circumstances here: The Colorado,

The J. E. Trudeau, 54 Fed. 907; The Samson, 217 Fed.
344; The I. C. White, 295 Fed. 593. The so-called "rate
making" cases are somewhat analogous, in so far as a
"fair value" is sought as the basis of fixing a reasonable
rate for public utilities. Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466;
Galveston Electric Co v. City of Galveston, 258 U. S.
388; The Minnesota Rate Cases, supra; Georgia Ry. &
Power Co. v. Railway Comm., 262 U. S. 625. The

Many of the cases reject "reproduction" values, particularly, where, as in the present case, they are founded
on transitory and abnormal costs of production. Mersey
Docks and HarborBoard, 3 K. B: Div. 223, distinguished.
Abnormal and transitory values should not control, even
where market value is the test. City of New York v.

The fact that the Proteus was a requisitioned vessel,
and that her owner was deprived not only of the power
to dispose of her by sale, but of the right to her use,
at least until after March 1, 1920, was an important factor in measuring the damage sustained at the time of her
loss, and one which the Circuit Court of Appeals plainly
disregarded. The courts have recognized that vessels
requisitioned because of war conditions suffered thereby a
decrease in value to tleir owners. The Kia Ora, 246 Fed.

trollerv. Lloyds Royal Belge, supra. Braceville Coal Co.
v. People, 147 Ill. 66; InternationalNews Serv. v. Associated Press, 248 U. S. 215. The original cost of the Proteus, which was less than half of the amount awarded by
the Circuit Court of Appeals as measuring her value at
the time of the loss, was entirely disregarded as a factor
in ascertainment of the measure of the damage. The
Proteus was of a special type of construction, which would
have operated to reduce her sale value in the open market. That fact was disregarded by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. The application of the scale of valuation fixed
for vessel property by the Advisory Board of the War
Risk Insurance Bureau at the time of her loss, indicates
that the Proteus was worth less than $700,000, according to the Advisory Board's scale.

MR. JusTIcE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
August 19, 1918, the steamship Cushing, owned by the
petitioner, Standard Oil Company, and the Proteus, owned
by the respondent, Southern Pacific Company, and operated by the Director General of Railroads, collided. The
Proteus and her cargo were lost. Petitioner and respondents filed their petitions for limitation of liability. R. S.
ยงยง 4283-4285. Admiralty Rule 54. The proceedings
were consolidated. The District Court found that both
vessels were at fault and referred the question of damages
to a commissioner. 266 Fed. 570. He reported that there
should be awarded on account of the loss of the Proteus
$750,000, with interest. The report was confirmed and
decree entered, November 28, 1922. 285 Fed. 617. Petitioner and Southern Pacific Company appealed; the Director General did not appeal. The petitioner maintained
that the Cushing was not at fault and sought reversal on
that ground. The Southern Pacific Company contended

Opinion of the Court.

that the commissioner's valuation of the Proteus was too
low. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the fault of
the Cushing and held that the value of the Proteus at
the time of the collision was $1,225,000; and the decree of
the District Court was modified accordingly. 292 Fed.
560. The petition to this Court for a writ of certiorari
alleges that at the time of the collision the Proteus was
under the sole control of the Director General of Railroads, and that, if the vessel had not been lost, it would
have continued in his control until March 1, 1920; that
the claim of the Southern Pacific Company was against
the Standard Oil Company and the Director General, who
were joint tortfeasors causing the loss of the Proteus,
and that, after the expiration of the term of the Circuit
Court of Appeals, petitioner learned that a final settlement had been made between the Southern Pacific Company and the Director General, by which the liability of
the latter for the loss of the Proteus was satisfied by payment of $750,000 or by adjustment and settlement on that
basis. And the petition asserts that thereby any claim of
the Southern Pacific Company against petitioner was extinguished, because a settlement with one joint tortfeasor
precludes recovery from the other for the same loss. The
petition was granted. 263 U. S. 696. Later, the order
granting the writ was vacated as to personal injury, cargo
and passenger claimants against whom no error was assigned. 263 U. S. 681. By leave of this Court, additional
testimony relating to the settlement was taken in accordance with paragraph 2 of rule 12. 265 U. S. 569.
The material facts may be briefly stated. December
28, 1917, the President took over the combined rail and
water transportation system of the Southern Pacific Company and its subsidiaries. February 19, 1919, the Director General and the owner made a contract in respect of
the operation and upkeep of the properties and for the
compensation to be paid for their use during federal control. By it, the Director General was required to pay for

property destroyed and not replaced. December 19, 1922,
final settlement under the contract was made. The total
amount of all items claimed by the company was $54,252,694.57. There was paid $9,250,000 as a lump sum; and
that was accetited in full satisfaction of all claims, with
certain exceptions not here material. The company
claimed $1,268,090.26 for the Proteus and $16,663.80 for
the lighter Confidence. The Railroad Administration
kept a record showing how the lump sum was arrived at.
In this record there was allocated on account of the
Proteus and the Confidence a lump sum of $885,000, but
this was not in any wise communicated to the company.
There was no agreement as to the value of the Proteus or
as to the amount included in the lump sum on account of
her loss or on account of any other item. On the facts
disclosed, it is impossible to attribute to her loss any particular amount.
The rule of the common law that one who is injured
by a joint tort and accepts satisfaction from one of the
wrongdoers cannot recover from the other does not apply.
By reason of the immunity of the United States from
suit, the Southern Pacific Company did not have the same
remedy against the Director General that an owner would
have against a private charterer. Waiver of sovereign
immunity from suit was not broad enough to permit an
action in tort by the company against the Director General for the loss of the Proteus. See ยง 10, Federal Control Act, c. 25, 40 Stat. 456; Dupont de Nemours & Co.
v. Davis, 264 U. S. 456, 462; MissouriPacific R. R. v. Ault,
256 U. S. 554. In respect of that, there was no breach of
duty owed to the respondent by the Director General as
a common carrier. As was said in The Western Maid,
257 U. S. 419, 433, "The United States has not consented
to be sued for torts, and therefore it cannot be said that
in a legal sense the United States has been guilty of a
tort." At the time of the collision, the Director General
was a special owner having exclusive possession and con-

trol of the vessel; the Southern Pacific Company was the
owner of the reversion. Together they had full title, and
joined in the petition for limitation of liability. Adjustment of their interests under the contract could be made
before as well as after the end of litigation. No question
of tort or negligence on the part of the Director General
was involved. The settlement had no relation to the
wrongful act of petitioner and did not affect its liability.
Ridgeway v. Sayre Electric Co., 258 Pa. 400, 406. Petitioner is not entitled to dismissal as against the Southern
Pacific Company. Nor is the Director General bound by
the decree of the District Court as to the amount of damages. On appeal in admiralty, there is a trial de novo.
The whole case was opened in the Circuit Court of Appeals by the appeal of the Southern Pacific Company as
much as it would have been if the Director General had
also appealed. Reid v. American Express Co., 241 U. S.
544; Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca, 248 U. S.
9, 21; The John Twohy, 255 U. S. 77; lunson S. S. Line
v. Miramar S. S. Co., 167 Fed. 960. And see Irvine v.
The Hesper, 122 U. S. 256, 266.
It is fundamental in the law of damages that the injured party is entitled to compensation for the loss sustained. Where property is destroyed by wrongful act, the
owner is entitled to its money equivalent, and thereby to
be put in as good position pecuniarily as if his property
had not been destroyed. In case of total loss of a vessel,
the measure of damages is its market value, if it has a
market value, at the time of destruction. The Baltimore,
8 Wall. 377, 385. Where there is no market value such
as is established by contemporaneous sales of like property in the way of ordinary business, as in the case of merchandise bought and sold in the market, other evidence is
resorted to. The value of the vessel lost properly may
be taken to be the sum which, considering all the circumstances, probably could have been obtained for her on the
date of the collision; that is, the sum that in all proba-

bility would result from fair negotiations between an
owner willing to sell and a purchaser desiring to buy.
Brooks-Scanlon Corporationv. United States, 265 U. S.
106, 123. And by numerous decisions of this Court it is
firmly established that the cost of reproduction as of the
date of valuation constitutes evidence properly to be considered in the ascertainment of value: Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, 262 U. S.
276, 287, and cases cited; Bluefield Co. v. Public Service
Commission, 262 U. S. 679, 689; Georgia Ry. & Power Co.
v. Railroad Commission, 262 U. S. 625, 629; BrooksScanlon Corporation v. United States, supra, 125; Ohio
Utilities Company v. Public Utilities Commission, 267
U. S. 359. The same rule is applied in England. In re
Mersey Docks and Admiralty Commisisoners [1920],
3 K. B. 223; Toronto City Corporationv. Toronto Railway
Corporation, [1925] A. C. 177, 191. It is to be borne in
mind that value is the thing to be found and that neither
cost of reproduction new, nor that less depreciation, is the
measure or sole guide. The ascertainment of value is not
controlled by artificial rules. It is not a matter of formulas, but there must be a reasonable judgment having its
basis in a proper consideration of all relevant facts. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 434.
The Proteus was a steel passenger and freight steamship, built in 1900 for use in the Southern Pacific Company's service between New York and New Orleans. Her
original cost was $557,600. In 1909, she was reboilered
and otherwise improved at a cost of $90,000. The evidence shows that she was unusually well kept and in excellent condition for use. The District Court found that in
1917 and 1918, on account of unprecedented demand and
a shortage of shipbuilding facilities, the market value of
ships was higher than the cost of construction; and also
found that in 1918, when the Proteus was lost, the cost
of construction was approaching the peak which came
some months later. 285 Fed. 619, 620. Respondents

called three witnesses experienced in shipbuilding and
familiar with construction costs and value of ships in 1918.
Each made an estimate of the cost of reproduction of the
Proteus as of the date of the loss. Their estimates were
respectively $1,755,450, $1,750,000 and $1,750,000. One
of these witnesses and two others called by respondent
testified respectively that in 1918 the value of the Proteus
was $1,225,000, $1,297,637 and $1,350,000. The petitioner called a mechanical engineer and naval architect
connected with its construction department, who testified
that the cost of reproduction of the Proteus in 1918 would
have been three times its original cost or approximately
$1,670,000. It called two other witnesses, who had been
members of a.government board of appraisers for the determination of just compensation for vessels requisitioned.
They expressed the opinion that the cost of reproduction
of the Proteus in 1918 would have been two and a half
times its original cost or approximately $1,400,000. But
they made no detailed estimates. The figures were arrived at by examination of statistics showing labor and
material costs. These three witnesses testified respectively that at the time of the loss the value of the ship
was $630,000, $650,000 and $611,000.
In view of changed prices, the original cost of the
vessel was not useful as a guide to her value when lost.
In The Clyde, 1 Swabey 23, Doctor Lushington, speaking of what a vessel would fetch in the market, said
(p. 24): "In order to ascertain this,-there are various
species of evidence that may be resorted to-for instance,
the value of the vessel when built. But that is only one
species of evidence, because the value may furnish a very
inferior criterion whereby to ascertain the value at the
moment of destruction. The length of time during which
the vessel has been used, and the degree of deterioration
suffered, will affect the original price at which the vessel
was built. But there is another matter infinitely more
important than this--known even to the most un-

learned-the constant change which takes place in the
market. It is the market price which the Court looks
to, and nothing else, as the value of the property. It is
an old saying, 'The worth of a thing is the price it will
bring.'" And see City of Winona v. Wisconsin-Minnesota Light & Power Co., 276 Fed. 996, 1003.
Restitutio in integrum is the leading maxim applied by
admiralty courts to ascertain damages resulting from a
collision (The Baltimore, supra, 385), and on the same
principle, value is the measure of compensation in case of
total loss. The evidence requires a finding that, as of the
date of her loss, the cost of reproduction new of the
Proteus was not less than $1,750,000. Ordinarily, contemporaneous cost of construction would be a good indication of the amount of damages resulting from the loss
'of a new ship. There ought not to be any difference between reasonable original cost and estimated cost of
reproduction as of the date when built. But the Proteus
was 18 years old when lost, and all the witnesses who
testified on the subject fixed her value at that time higher
than her original cost and lower than the estimated cost
of construction. There is no established method or rule
for determining the difference between her value at the
time of the loss and what her value would have been if
then new. It was shown that annual rates of depreciation used in the accounts of shipowners varied from two
and a half to five per cent., and that such rates are affected by the policy of the owners, business conditions,
taxes and other things. It was not shown whether such
deductions covered annual depreciation resulting notwithstanding proper maintenance, or whether they included all or part of the current cost of upkeep. It did
not appear 'whether the rates were applied to reproduction cost or to original cost, or to an amount remaining
after deduction on account of scrap value or salvage
value or other minimum. In August, 1918, the immediate demand for ships was greater than the supply; the

Opinion of the Court.

shipyards were working to full capacity; wages and prices
were high; the trend of construction costs was upward,
and the element of time was of the utmost importance.
And witnesses on both sides testified that such conditions
make for a lower rate of depreciation to be taken into account in determining value. If new, the Proteus would
have been worth at least her cost of reproduction.
Plainly, conditions in 1918 justified a smaller deduction
from cost of reproduction new than before the war, and
made value of a vessel in good condition and ready for
use approach more nearly its value new.
Petitioner's mechanical engineer arrived at $630,000
by taking 34 per cent. of $1,670,000, reproduction cost as
found by him, and by making some relatively small adjustments on account of expenditures for maintenance
and improvement. He arrived at 66 per cent. deducted,
by taking 4 per cent. for 14 years and two and a half per
cent. for four years, making an average of over 3.6 per
cent. The two other witnesses called by petitioner arrived at $650,000 and $611,000 respectively, by taking
45.2 per cent. of $1,400,000, reproduction cost found by
them, and by making similar adjustments. They arrived at 54.8 per cent. deducted, by the use of a depreciation table prepared by another member of the board of
appraisers. This table applies to steel steamers in salt
water service. It is based on a life of 40 years. It makes
a different deduction for each year. For the first 20 years
it takes off 60 per cent. and for the last, 40 per cent. The
average annual rate is two and a half per cent. The evidence showed that the useful life of such a vessel is not
any fixed number of years, but varies greatly, depending
on upkeep and maintenance. The table was intended to
reflect average conditions of the different depreciable elements of ships of that class and to guide to average values
over extended periods, including times of depression as
well as of prosperity. The value fixed by each of petitioner's witnesses is more than $1,000,000 less than the

reproduction cost. The rate of depreciation taken by
petitioner's mechanical engineer is too high in view of the
conditions prevailing at the time of the loss. The other
witnesses based their calculation on a reproduction cost
that was too low. Moreover, certain valuations made by
the government board of appraisers of which they were
members seriously impair the weight of their testimony.
In 1917, the United States requisitioned the Havana and
the Saratoga, vessels of the same type as the Proteus and
about one and a half times its size, and constructed in
1906. Cramps estimated reproduction cost of each in
1917 to be $3,000,000, about three times original cost.
The board fixed value at $2,240,000 each, about 74 per
cent. of reproduction cost. But the value of the Proteus
as given by these witnesses was less than 38 per cent. of
her cost of reproduction new.
We think the commissioner and District Court failed
to give due regard to construction costs, conditions, wages
and prices affecting value in 1918; and that the evidence
sustains the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Decree affirmed.
