States v. Merriam, supra, pp. 187-188.
The property which respondent acquired being a bequest, there is no occasion to ask whether, before being
handed over to him, it had been carved from the original
corpus of, or from subsequent additions to, the estate.
The corpus of the estate was not the legacy which respondent received, but merely the source which gave rise
to it. The money here sought to be taxed was not the
fruits of a legacy; it was the legacy itself. Matter of

With the utmost respect for the judgment of my
brethren to the contrary, the opinion just rendered, I
think without warrant, searches the field of argument and

ST. LOUIS, BROWNSVILLE & MEXICO RAILWAY
COMPANY v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 310. Argued March 20, 1925.-Decided April 27, 1925.
1. Claims presented to the Court of Claims but not pressed, in
the same proceeding in which others were allowed and paid, held
barred by Jud. Code, § 178, providing: "The payment of the
amount due by any judgment of the Court of Claims ...
shall
be a full discharge to the United States of all claim and demand
touching any of the matters involved in the controversy." P. 171.
2. In settling a railroad's freight bill for transporting army impedimenta at tariff rates, the auditor for the War Department
erroneously made a deduction, by way of counterclaim, upon the
ground that part of the transportation was covered, under the
railroad's passenger tariff, by the baggage allowance of soldiers who

had moved over the line at the same time as the impedimenta-Held
that acceptance of the amount allowed, without protest or appeal
to the Comptroller of the Treasury, was not acquiescence on the
part of the railroad and did not bar it from suing for the balance
in the Court of Claims. P. 172.
3. No action of the accounting officials can bar the right of a claimant to have the Court of Claims determine whether he is entitled
to recover under a contract with the Government. P. 174.
4. To constitute acquiescence in payment by the Government of a
smaller sum than is due, something more must be shown than
acceptance of the smaller sum without protest; there must have
been some conduct of the creditor akin to abandonment or waiver,
or from which an estoppel might arise. P. 175.
5. The provision of the Dockery Act, July 31, 1894, c. 174, §§ 7, 8,
28 Stat. 162, 206, 207, making acceptance of payment under the
auditor's settlement, without appeal to the Comptroller, conclusive,
does not prevent proceedings in the Court of Claims. Pp. 173, 177.

MR. JUsTIcE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal by the St. Louis, Brownsville & Mexico Railway from a judgment of the Court of Claims
which disallowed three claims for transportation furnished to the War Department. 59. Ct. Cl. 82. That the
claims were originally valid is conceded. The defense as
to each is that recovery has been barred by discharge.
As to,two of the claims, by § 178 of the Judicial Code.
As to the third, by the rule declared in Oregon-Washington R. R. & Navigation Co. v. United States, 255 U. S.
339. Whether on the facts found the statute and the
rule apply, are the questions for decision.
First. The two claims (numbered 3055 and 4732) were
for services rendered in 1917. They had been included
with many others in a petition filed in the Court of
Claims by the Railway in 1920. On that petition a
judgment had been entered for $22,624.78 and duly paid
before this suit was begun. The Judicial Code provides
in § 178: "The payment of the amount due by any judgment of the Court of Claims
shall be a full dis-

268 U. S.

charge to the United States of all claim and demand
touching any of the matters involved in the controversy."
The Railway contends that these two claims were not
"matters involved in the controversy" on which the
earlier judgment was entered. To establish that contention it must rely wholly upon the following finding made
in this case: "One of the findings of fact in said [the
earlier] case stated that 'the numbers and amounts referred to in the foregoing paragraphs constitute the component parts and sum total of the said $22,624.78 and are
the only items in question in the case at bar.' Bills No.
3055 and No. 4732 are not mentioned in the findings in that
case. The report of the Treasury Department filed iD
said case and upon which said stipulation of facts was
based stated as to bills No. 3055 and No. 4732 that because no deduction had been made from these bills 'on
account of the cause of complaint set forth in the petition nothing is due in recovery.'
The finding thus relied upon by the Railway does not
show that these two claims were not among "the matters
involved in the controversy" in the earlier case. On the
contrary, it shows that they were there in controversy.
And it suggests that the Railway, after the introduction
of the report of the Treasury Department, acquiesced in
the latter's conclusion that as to these two claims "nothing is due." Compare United States v. Frerichs,124 U. S.
315, 320; Michot v. United States, 31 Ct. Cls. 299;
Vaughn v. United States, 34 Ct. Cls. 342. The case is
unlike Spicer v. United States, 5 Ct. Cls. 34; Book v.
United States, 31 Ct. Cls. 272; and Adams v. United
States, 33 Ct. Cls. 411. As to these two claims the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.
Second. The remaining claim is for the disallowed part
of a claim for $2,549.08 which was "settled by the Auditor for the War Department May 10, 1920" by making
certain deductions, thus allowing a smaller sum. It has

never been involved in any litigation. The whole claim
presented to the Auditor was on a single government bill
of lading for transporting, in 1916, so-called Army impedimenta; that is, guns, ammunition, caissons, tents and
miscellaneous military equipment belonging to the United
States. That the whole of the service covered by the
bill was actually rendered was never questioned. Nor
was there any dispute either as to quantity or weight, or
as to the tariff rate under which such articles ordinarily
move. Thus, the claim presented to the Auditor was definite in amount. The deduction made by him was somewhat. in the nature of a counterclaim. The Comptroller
of the Treasury ruled in 1918 that, for the transportation
of military impedimenta, the Government was entitled
to the benefit of a provision in a passenger tariff by- which,
when persons travel in a party, there is allowed for every
twenty-five passenger fares one baggage car free for personal effects. The Auditor apparently found that, at. the
same time these impedimenta moved, at least twentyfive soldiers had moved over the line. He therefore deducted a corresponding amount from this independent
bill for freight. In suits brought by other companies
the Court of Claims held that the Comptroller's ruling
was wrong. See Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. United
States, 56 Ct. Cls. 341. Thereupon, this suit was brought
in August, 1922, to recover the amount wrongly deducted.
The lower court held that the Railway was barred from
recovery because it had accepted, without protest or
appeal, the reduced amount which the Auditor allowed.
There is no statute or departmental rule which, as in
Nichols v. United States, 7 Wall. 122, makes such protest
or appeal a condition precedent to the existence of the
cause of action or to plaintiff's right to resort to the Court
of Claims. In respect to furnishing transportation, a railroad ordinarily bears to the Government the same relation
that it does to a private person using its facilities. It may

exact payment either in advance or upon the completion
of the service rendered. It may, as a matter of accomodation or convenience, give a reasonable credit. Payment
for transportation, as for other service or supplies, may
ordinarily be secured by presenting the claim to the appropriate disbursing officer of the department served. Because of limitations imposed upon the powers of disbursing officers, it is often desirable to present the claim for
direct settlement to the Auditor for the department, who
is an accounting officer of the Treasury. The Auditor
may allow the claim in whole or in part. If his action is
not satisfactory, either to the claimant or to the head of
the department affected, an appeal may be taken to the
Comptroller of the Treasury for its revision. In the
absence of an appeal, the settlement of the auditor is
"final and conclusive upon the Executive Branch of the
Government." In case of such appeal the decision of the
Comptroller is conclusive. Any person accepting payment under a settlement by the Auditor is precluded from
obtaining such revision of the settlement as to any item
upon which payment is accepted. Dockery Act, July 31,
1894, c. 174, §§ 7, 8, 28 Stat. 162, 206, 207.
No action of these officials can bar the right of a claimant to have the Court of Claims determine whether he
is entitled to recover under a contract with the Government. Oregon-Washington R. R. & Navigation Co. v.
United States, 54 Ct. Cls. 131, 138, 139. Compare United
States v. Harmon, 147 U. S. 268; United States v. Babcock, 250 U. S.328. The right to invoke the legal remedy
may be lost by the claimant's failure to invoke it within
the statutory period of limitations. But the substantive
right to recover an amount confessedly due can be lost
only through some act or omission on the part of the
claimant which, under the rules of the common law as
applied by this Court to claims against the Government,
discharges the cause of action. Acquiescence by the claim-

Opinion of the Court.

ant in the payment by the Government of a smailer
amount than is due will ordinarily effect the discharge.
Acquiescence can be established by showing conduct before the payment which might have led the Government
to believe that the amount allowed was all that was
claimed, or that such amount, if paid, would be received
in full satisfaction of the claim. Acquiescence can, also,
be established by showing conduct after the payment
which might have led the Government to believe that the
amount actually received was accepted in full satisfaction of the original claim. But to constitute acquiescence
within the meaning of this rule, something more than
acceptance of the smaller sum without protest must be
shown. There must have been some conduct on the part
of the creditor akin to abandonment or waiver or from
vwhich an estoppel might arise. Every case in which this
Court has sustained the affirmative defense of acquiescence rests upon findings which include at least one of
these additional features.' In the case at bar they are
wholly lacking.
The affirmative defense of acquiescence by acceptance
of a smaller sum than was actually due-the bar relied
upon in this suit-must not be confused with other
affirmative defenses which are often interposed to suits
in which the plaintiff claims that the Government has

are accord and satisfaction or compromise of a disputed
claim; 2 voluntary submission of a disputed claim to an
investigating board and acceptance of the amount allowed by it; ' adjustment of damages inherently unliquidated; " surrender of the instrument sued on; ' prior
acceptance of the principal of a debt as a bar to a suit for
accrued interest; 6 prior judgment on part of an indivisible
demand. ' Cases in which acquiescence by acceptance of
a smaller sum is relied upon as an affirmative defense
must also be differentiated from those in which acquiescence is proved to show that the claim sued on never arose.
Prominent among the cases of this character are those
in which a railroad, free to decline, carried the mail after
notice from the Postmaster General that payment for
future services would be made at a reduced rate.' In

such cases the plaintiff fails, even where it appears that
the reduced payment was accepted under protest, because
the contract implied in fact on which it seeks to recover
cannot be established. Cases involving the affirmative defense of acquiescence by acceptance of a smaller sum
than was actually due must likewise be differentiated from
those in which one wrongly removed from a statutory
office is denied relief unless suit is instituted promptly.
The latter rest upon a policy not here applicable.' The
cases urged upon our attention by counsel for the Government present, in the main, instances of defenses other
than acquiescence.
The claim here in question was for an amount fixed
by the tariff. A bill for the full sum due was presented
to the appropriate officer. The deduction made by the
Auditor was without warrant in law. There was no act
or omission of the claimant which could conceivably have
induced the making of the deduction. Nor did the claimant in any way indicate satisfaction with the reduced
amount received by it. The Government did not establish the affirmative defense of acquiescence ,by showing
merely acceptance without protest. To hold that such
acceptance barred the right to recover the balance
wrongly withheld was to give it an effect in judicial proceedings similar to that which it had within the executive
department under the Dockery Act. See Texas & Pacific
Ry. Co. v. United States, 57 Ct. Cls. 284. For such a
rule there is no support either in the legislation of Congress or in the decisions of this Court. Compare Clyde
