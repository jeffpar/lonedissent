CERTIORARI

to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Ap-

peals reversing a judgment of the District Court (290
Fed. 604) recovered by Ludington in an action for money
paid under protest as income tax.
The Solicitor General, with whom Messrs. Robert P.
Reeder and Frederick W. Dewart were on the brief, for
petitioner.
Mr. William D. Guthrie, with whom Messrs. Hugh
Satterlee, William R. Perkins and Ralph B. Evans were
on the briefs, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This case arises under the income tax provisions of
the Revenue Act of 1918,' and presents another aspect
of the question relating to deductible losses sustained
from the sale of property acquired before March 1, 1913,
which was involved in United States v. Flannery, just
decided, ante, p. 98.
Ludington bought, prior to March 1, 1913, certain corporate stock for $32,500. Its market value on March 1,
1913, was $37,050. He sold it in 1919 for $3,866.91, which
was $28,633.09 less than its purchase price, and $33,'Act of Feb. 24, 1919, c. 18, Title II, 40 Stat. 1057.

Opinion of the Court.

183.09 less than its market value on March 1, 1913. In
his income tax return he deducted the latter sum as the
amount of his loss on the sale of the stock. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue reduced the amount of the
deduction to the actual loss of $28,633.09, and assessed
an additional tax against him. He paid this tax under
protest, and, after the usual preliminary procedure,
brought this suit against the Collector in a federal District Court in Pennsylvania to recover the amount so
paid. Judgment was entered for the defendant. 290
Fed. 604. This was reversed by the Court of Appeals.
1 Fed. (2d) 689. And this writ of certiorari was granted.
266 U. S. 599.
The case is governed by the decision in United States
v. Flannery, supra. It was there held, on the authority
of Goodrich v. Edwards, 255 U. S. 527, and Walsh v.
Brewster, 255 U. S. 536, that the Act allowed a deduction to the extent only that an actual loss was sustained
from the investment, as measured by the difference between the purchase and sale prices of the property. It
follows that, as the actual loss to Ludington in the entire
transaction was the difference between the purchase and
selling prices, that is, $28,633.09, he was only entitled to
deduct this amount, and not the difference of $33,183.09
between the market value on March 1, 1913 and the selling price. This is in exact correspondence with the decision in Walsh v. Brewster, supra, in reference to the
second transaction there involved, in which it was held
that the taxable gain derived from the sale of property
was only the difference between the purchase and selling
prices, and not the difference between the market value
on March 1, 1913 and the selling price.
So under the Income Tax Law of New York, which,
as pointed out in United States v. Flannery, is a substantial transcript of the Revenue Act. of 1918, except that
January 1, 1919 is substituted for March 1, 1913, it was
