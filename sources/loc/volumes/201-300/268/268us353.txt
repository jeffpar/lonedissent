CERTIORARI

TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 11.

Argued October 5, 1923.-Decided May 25, 1925.

1. By the law of New York a transfer of property, as security for
a debt, which reserves to the transferor the right to dispose of the
property or to apply its proceeds for his own uses, is fraudulent
and void as to creditors. P. 360.
2. This rule applies to the assignment of present and future book
accounts as well as to assignment of chattels, since it does not
result from the retention of ostensible ownership by the assignor,
but from the fact that the reservation of dominion by him is
inconsistent with the effective disposition of title and creation of a
lien. P. 361.
3. Held that an assignment made by a mercantile corporation, more
than four months before it was adjudged bankrupt, of its present
and future accounts receivable as security for a loan, was void
under the above rule, so that delivery of a list of accounts, and payments made within the four months, were inoperative to perfect a

CERTIORARI to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed an order of the District Court requiring a receiver and trustee in bankruptcy to pay over
money collected from accounts receivable to a creditor
of the bankrupt claiming them as security under an assignment, and denying the trustee's petition that the creditor be required to pay over collections made by him under
the assignment.

Mr. Selden Bacon, for petitioner.
A contemporaneous agreement that, despite an assignment of property as collateral security to secure the assignee for a debt due him from the assignor, the assignor
may continue to use and dispose of the property as his
own, retaining and using the proceeds in his business,
without accounting therefor in any way to his assignee,
renders the assignment fraudulent and void as against
creditors, not only in the case of ordinary chattel mortgages but also in the case of assignments confined to accounts receivable. In re Leslie-Judge Co., 272 Fed. 886;

BENEDICT v. RATNER.
353

Argument for Respondent.

The decisions in Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90, and in
Chapman v. Hunt, 254 Fed. 768, in no way conflict with
the rule we invoke.
Even were the rule predicated on a false appearance
of ownership, the facts here supply the equivalent, and
more than the equivalent, of any false appearance of
ownership arising from possession of tangibles. There
was the actual appearance of ownership deliberately preserved and sustained, and deliberate concealment of the
assignment to avoid the obvious and contemplated consequences of disclosure of the fact of the assignment of all
receivables present and future.
If the assignment was galvanized into actuality by
Ratner's taking over the checks as they came in, during
the last week before the bankruptcy, that galvanization
process went no further than his actual receipts of about
$12,000, and the decree for further payment to him of
some $18,000 is erroneous. Moreover as to the $12,000
the transaction was preferential. The main question presented is of the utmost importance to the business community and to the administration of the Bankruptcy Act.
Mr. Louis S. Posner, for respondent.
An assignment of property to be acquired thereafter
operates by way of present contract to give a lien which,
as between the parties, takes effect and attaches to the
subject of it as soon as it comes into the ownership of the
assignor. "Such lien becomes perfected and ripens into
a right at law which is enforcible against third parties if,
after the property is acquired, the assignee take possession
thereof prior to an execution or attachment levy thereon,
or the like, by third parties, or the appointment of a receiver upon the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or
against the assignor. McCaffrey v. Woodin, 65 N. Y.
463; Thompson v. Fairbanks,196 U. S. 516.
The facts here constitute the equivalent, and more than
the equivalent, of taking possession of the accounts re-

ceivable to the full extent that the nature of these choses
in action permitted. And since this was done before
any third parties had "fastened" a lien, it is enforcible
against third parties, including the receiver in bankruptcy
and his successor trustee. Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine
Co., 239 U. S. 275-276; Thompson v. Fairbanks, supra;
McCaffrey v. Woodin, supra; Sexton v. Kessler, 225
U. S. 90.
The agreement in question was not recorded because
the recording acts of New York permit this to be done
only with reference to "goods and chattels," and exclude
choses in action from their operation. Niles v. Methusa,
162 N. Y. 546. The four-month rule does not apply to
the situation, since the intervening acts by which possession was taken of the after-acquired accounts relate back
to the date of the original agreement, which took place
more than four months previously. Bracket v. Harvey,
91 N. Y. 214; Thompson v. Fairbanks, supra; Sexton v.
Kessler, supra. Such cases as have been found which
deal with the assignment of intangibles or choses in
action, present or future, such as accounts, bonds, and
the like, sustain the position of the appellee and entitle
him to the proceeds of the balance of the accounts, at
least of those accounts which were included in the list
last delivered to him, until his loans are repaid in full
with interest. Stackhouse v. Holden, 66 A. D. (N. Y.)
423; Sexton v. Kessler, supra; Greey v. Dockendorif, 231
U. S. 516; In re Mfichigan Furniture Company, 249 Fed.
974; Union Trust v. Bulkeley, 150 Fed. 510; In re McCauley, 158 Fed. 332. No question of good faith exists
in the case based upon the secrecy of the transaction,
which we maintain to be a condition inherent in it and
which the courts so recognize. Greey v. Dockendorf,
supra; Stackhouse v. Holden, supra.
It is the law in New York that a mortgage of goods
and chattels wherein the mortgagor reserves the right of

Opinion of the Court.

disposal, for his own benefit, is deemed fraudulent in law
and void. The rule rests in the original conception that
the visible possession of personal property indicated ownership,-a condition which cannot in its nature apply to
such intangible property as choses in action, and which
has never been held so to apply in any decisions which
we have been able to find or which the appellant cites.
The doctrine in question, based upon the conceptions of
reputed ownership in the days when rights of property
had their beginnings, must be deemed to be greatly out of
joint with modern conceptions of industry and modes of
possession; in any event, the doctrine, if it cannot be disregarded, should at least be limited and held within its
present confines rather than extended into a field where
it never before has played a part and where it can but
serve as an embarrassment to business. Such considerations of public interest as here exist point clearly that
way, particularly since those who enter into business relations know full well that the utilization of accounts receivable, in order to keep business liquid, is one of the
commonest practices of everyday business.
MR. JUSTIcE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Hub Carpet Company was adjudicated bankrupt
by the federal court for southern New York in involuntary proceedings commenced September 26, 1921. Benedict, who was appointed receiver and later trustee, collected the book accounts of the company. Ratner filed in
that court a petition in equity praying that the amounts
so collected be paid over to him. He claimed them under
a writing given May 23, 1921-four months and three
days before the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. By it the company purported to assign to him,
as collateral for certain loans, all accounts present and
future. Those collected by the receiver were, so far as

268 U. S.

appears, all accounts which had arisen after the date of
the assignment, and were enumerated in the monthly list
of accounts outstanding which was delivered to Ratner
September 23. Benedict resisted the petition on the
ground that the original assignment was void under the
law of New York as a fraudulent conveyance; that, for
this reason, the delivery of the September list of accounts
was inoperative to perfect a lien in Ratner; and that it
was a preference under the Bankruptcy Act. He also
filed a cross-petition in which he asked that Ratner be
ordered to pay to the estate the proceeds of certain collections which had been made by the company after September 17 and turned over to Ratner pursuant to his request made on that day. The company was then insolvent and Ratner had reason to believe it to be so. These
accounts also had apparently been acquired by the company after the date of the original assignment.
The District Judge decided both petitions in Ratner's
favor. He ruled that the assignment executed in May
was not fraudulent in law; that it created an equity in
the future acquired accounts; that because of this equity,
Ratner was entitled to retain, as against the bankrupt's
estate, the proceeds of the accounts which had been collected by the company in September and turned over to
him; that by delivery of the list of the accounts outstanding on September 23, this equity in them had ripened into
a perfect title to the remaining accounts; and that the
title so perfected was good as against the supervening
bankruptcy. Accordingly, the District Court ordered
that, to the extent of the balance remaining unpaid on
his loans, there be paid Ratner all collections made from
accounts enumerated in any of the lists delivered to Ratner; and that the cross-petition of Benedict be denied.
There was no finding of fraud in fact. On appeal, the
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order. 282 Fed.

U. S. 579.

BENEDICT v. RATNER.
353

Opinion of the Court.

The rights of the parties depend primarily upon the
law of New York. Hiscock v. Varick Bank of N. Y., 206
U. S. 28. It may be assumed that, unless the arrangement of May 23 was void because fraudulent in law, the
original assignment of the future acquired accounts became operative under the state law, both as to those paid
over to Ratner before the bankruptcy proceedings and as
to those collected by the receiver;' and that the assignment will be deemed to have taken effect as of May 23.
Sexton v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90, 99. That being so, it is
clear that, if the original assignment was a valid one
under the law of New York, the Bankruptcy Act did not
invalidate the subsequent dealings of the parties. Thompson v. Fairbanks, 196 U. S. 516; Humphrey v. Tatman,
198 U. S. 91. The sole question for decision is, therefore,
whether on the following undisputed facts the assignment of May 23 was in law fraudulent.
The Hub Carpet Company was, on May 23, a.mercantile concern doing business in New York City and proposing to continue to do so. The assignment was made there
to secure an existing loan of $15,000, and further advances
not exceeding $15,000 which were in fact made July 1,
1921. It included all accounts receivable then outstanding and all which should thereafter accrue in the ordinary
course of business. A list of the existing accounts was
delivered at the time. Similar lists were to be delivered
to Ratner on or about the 23d day of each succeeding
month containing the accounts outstanding at such future
dates. Those enumerated in each of the lists delivered
prior to September,' aggregated between $100,000 and
$120,000. The receivables were to be collected by the
company. Ratner was given the right, at any time, to

demand a full disclosure of the business and financial
conditions; to require that all amounts collected be applied in payment of his loans; and to enforce the assignment although no loan had matured. But until he did
so, the company was not required to apply any of the
collections to the repayment of Ratner's loan. It was
not required to replace accounts collected by other collateral of equal value. It was not required to account in
any way to Ratner. It was at liberty to use the proceeds
of all accounts collected as it might see fit. The existence of the assignment was to be kept secret. The business was to be conducted as theretofore. Indebtedness
was to be incurred, as usual, for the purchase of merchandise and otherwise in the ordinary course of business. The
amount of such indebtedness unpaid at the time of the
commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings was large.
Prior to September 17, the company collected from
accounts so assigned about $150,000, all of which it applied
to purposes other than the payment of Ratner's loan.
The outstanding accounts enumerated in the list delivered September 23 aggregated $90,000.
Under the law of New York a transfer of property as
security which reserves to the transferor the right to dispose of the same, or to apply the proceeds thereof, for his
own uses is, as to creditors, fraudulent in law and void.Griswold v. Sheldon, 4 N. Y. 580; Edgell v. Hart, 9 N. Y. 213;

whether the instrument of transfer be recorded or'not."L

the arrangement of May 23 was clearly void; and the
equity in the future acquired accounts, which it would
otherwise have created, 12 did not arise. Whether the rule

upon by the Court of Appeals of New York. But it would

or of accounts, reservation of dominion inconsistent with
the effective disposition of title must render the transaction void. Ratner asserts that the rule stated above rests
upon ostensible ownership, and argues that the doctrine
of ostensible ownership is not applicable to book accounts.
That doctrine raises a presumption of fraud where chattels are mortgaged (or sold) and possession of the property
is not delivered to the mortgagee (or ve.dee)."1 The presumption may be avoided by recording the mortgage (or
sale). It may be assumed, as Ratner contends, that the
doctrine does not apply to the assignment of accounts. In
their transfer there is nothing which corresponds to the
delivery of possession of chattels. The statutes which
embody the doctrine and provide for recording as a substitute for delivery do not include accounts. A title to an
account good against creditors may be transferred without
notice to the debtor 1. or record of any kind."5 But it is

N. Y. 360. The statutes to this effect merely embody the commonlaw rule. But, in New York, an additional statute provides that
unrecorded chattel mortgages under such circumstances are absolutely
void as to creditors. New York Lien Law, ยง 230; Laws, 1909, c. 38,

property by sale, retention of possession creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. See Kimball v. Cash, 176 N. Y. Supp. 541; also New
York Ice Co. v. Cousins, 23 App. Div. 560; Rheinfeldt v. Dahlman,

Opinion of the Court.

not true that the rule stated above and invoked by the
receiver is either based upon or delimited by the doctrine
of ostensible ownership. It rests not upon seeming ownership because of possession retained, but upon a lack of
ownership because of dominion reserved. It does not
raise a presumption of fraud. It imputes fraud conclusively because of the reservation of dominion inconsistent
with the effective disposition of title and creation of a
lien.
The nature of the rule is made clear by its limitations.
Where the mortgagor of chattels agrees to apply the proceeds of their sale to the payment 'of the mortgage debt or
to the purchase of other chattels which shall become subject to the lien, the mortgage is good as against creditors,
if recorded."0 The mortgage is sustained in such cases
"upon the ground that such sale and application of proceeds is the normal and proper purpose of a chattel mortgage, and within the precise boundaries of its lawful operation and effect. It does no more than to substitute the
mortgagor as the agent of the mortgagee to do exactly
what the latter had the right to do, and what it was his
privilege and his duty to accomplish. It devotes, as it
should, the mortgaged property to the payment of the
mortgage debt." The permission to use the proceeds to
furnish substitute collateral "provides only for a shifting
of the lien from one piece of property to another taken in
exchange." Brackett v. Harvey, 91 N. Y. 214, 221, 223.
309, 364; Young v. Upson, 115 Fed. 192. In 1916, Section 230 of the
New York Lien- Law was amended to the effect that a mortgage,
pledge, or lien on stocks or bonds given to secure the repayment of a
loan is, if not recorded, absolutely void against creditors unless such
securities are delivered to the mortgagee or pledgee on the day the
loan is made. See N. Y. Laws, 1916, c. 348.

Bank v. Bates, 120 U. S." 556, 561.

Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

On the other hand, if the agreement is that the mortgagor
may sell and use the proceeds for his own benefit, the
mortgage is of no effect although recorded. Seeming
ownership exists in both classes of cases because the mortgagor is permitted to remain in possession of the stock in
trade and to sell it freely. But it is only where the unrestricted dominion over the proceeds is reserved to the
mortgagor that the mortgage is void. This dominion is
the differentiating and deciding element. The distinction
was recognized in Sexton. v. Kessler, 225 U. S. 90, 98
where a transfer of securities was sustained."7 It was
pointed out that a reservation of full control by the mortgagor might well prevent the effective creation of a lien
in the mortgagee and that the New York cases holding
such a mortgage void rest upon that doctrine.
The results which flow from reserving dominion inconsistent with theeffective disposition of title must be the
same whatever the nature of the property transferred.
The doctrine which imputes fraud where full dominion
is reserved must apply to assignments of accounts although the doctrine of ostensible ownership does not.
There must also, be the same distinction as to degrees of
dominion. Thus, although an agreement that the assignor of accounts shall collect them and pay the proceeds
to the assignee will not invalidate the assignment which
it accompanies,"8 the assignment must be deemed fraudulent in law if it is agreed that the assignor may use the
proceeds as he sees fit.

use by the company of the proceeds of the accounts preI'See note 18, infra.

cluded the effective crea.t.ion of a lien " and rendered the
original assignment fraudulent in law. Consequently the
payments to Ratner and the delivery of the September
list of accounts were inoperative to perfect a lien in him,
and were unlawful preferences. " On this ground, and
also because the payment was fraudulent under the law
of the State, the trustee was entitled to recover the
amount.2 '
Stackhouse v. Holder7,, 66 App. Div. 423, is relied upon
by Ratner to establish the proposition that reservation
of dominion does not invalidate an assignment of accounts. The decision was by an intermediate appellate
court, and, although decided in 1901, appears never to
have been cited since in any court of that State. 2- There
was a,strong dissenting opinion. Moreover, the case is
perhaps distinguishable on its facts, p. 426. Grccy v.
Dockendorf], 231 U. S. 513, upon which Ratner also relies, has no bearing on the case at bar. It involved assignment of accounts, but there was no retention of dominion by the bankrupt. The sole question was whether
successive assignments of accounts by way of security,
made in pursuance of a contract., were bad because the
contract embraced all the accounts. The lien acquired
before knowledge by either party of insolvency was held
good against the trustee.
