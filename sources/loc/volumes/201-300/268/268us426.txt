CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

Nos. 191, 192, 193. Argued March 13, 1924; reargued November 26,
1924.-Decided May 25, 1925.
1. When the petitioner in an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding
dies before adjudication, the proceeding does not abate but under
Rev. Stats. ยง 955 may be prosecuted by his personal representative. P. 428.
2. The Bankruptcy Act gives no authority to adjudge a partnership bankrupt upon a petition filed against it by but one of its
members. P. 431.
3. Section 5c of the Bankruptcy Act providing that the court of
bankruptcy having jurisdiction of one of the partners may have
jurisdiction of all the partners and of the administration of the
partnership and individual property, relates solely to the venue or
the territorial jurisdiction" of the court. P. 431.
4. A petition by a partner to have himself, the partnership and the
other partners declared bankrupt, and not purporting to be a petition of the partnership or authorized by it, can not be regarded
as a voluntary petition of the partnership. P. 432.
5. An involuntary petition against a partnership must be filed by
creditors and allege an act of bankruptcy. P. 432.
6. The authority conferred on this Court by ยง 30 of the Bankruptcy
Act to prescribe all necessary rules, forms and orders as to procedure and for carrying the Act into effect, is limited to provisions for the execution of the Act itself, and does not authorize
additions to its substantive provisions. P. 434.
7. General Order No. 8 and Form No. 2, in purporting to authorize
one or less than all the partners to file a petition against the partnership without the consent of the others, do not relate to the

CERTIORARI to judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed orders of the District Court denying motions to dismiss, pro tanta, a petition in bankruptcy. General Order in Bankruptcy No. 8 and Form
No. 2, were abrogated by order of May 25, 1925.
Messrs. Mortimer C. Rhone and Ellis L. Orvis, with
whom Messrs. HarryKeller and R. L. Bigelow were on the
briefs, for petitioners.
Messrs. Samuel D. Gettig and Newton B. Spangler,
with whom Mr. James C. Furst was on the brief, for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE SANFORD delivered the opinion of. the
Court.
These three cases involve the same proceedings which
were before us at an earlier stage in Meek v. Centre Banking Co., 264 U. S. 499. They rose out of a petition in
bankruptcy filed by the respondent Shugert in a Federal
District Court in Pennsylvania for the adjudication as
bankrupts (a) of himself, (b) of a partnership styled the
Centre County Banking Co., in which he and the present
petitioners, Meek, Dale and Breeze, hereinafter called
the defendants, were alleged to be members, and (c) of
the defendants individually. The defendants resisted the
petition in so far as it sought to have the partnership and
themselves adjudged bankrupts, and moved to dismiss it
to that extent. Orders denying these motions were entered by the District Court; and these, on petitions to
revise, were affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.

Thereafter, but before the hearing in this court, Shugert
died. The defendants then moved in this court that the
proceeding in bankruptcy be dismissed as to them, both
individually and as members of the partnership, on the
ground that to that extent it abated by Shugert's death.
Finding the petition to be in this aspect an involuntary
and antagonistic proceeding, and there being then no adversary party before the court, we granted leave to any
persons claiming to be representatives of Shugert's interest to appear within thirty days and apply for leave to be
admitted as parties for the purpose of continuing the proceeding in his stead; stating that if this were done the
question whether the proceeding should be dismissed as
to the partnership and the defendants, or continued as
to them by such representatives, would then be determined. Meek v. Centre County Bank, supra, p. 504.
Thereafter the administrator of Shugert's estate seasonably appeared and applied for leave to be substituted in
Shugert's place as the petitioner in the bankruptcy proceeding. The defendants renewed their motions to dismiss; and the cases have been heard both on this preliminary issue and on the merits of the controversy.
1. The first question to be determined is whether Shugert's death before an adjudication had been made under
the petition, abated the bankruptcy proceeding as against
the partnership and the individual defendants, or whether
it may be continued against them by the administrator
of his estate. When either of the parties in any suit in
any court of the United States dies before final judgment,
the executor or administrator of such deceased party
may, in case the cause of action survives by law, prosecute or defend the suit to final judgment. Rev. Stat.
ยง 955. In Schreiber v. Sharpless, 110 U. S.76, 80, a suit
on a federal penal statute, in which the defendant had
died before judgment, it was held that whether an action
survives and may be continued under this section "de-

pends on the substance of the cause of action;" and that,
since at common law actions on penal statutes do not survive and Congress had not established any other rule in
respect to actions on federal penal statutes, the cause of
action died with the person of the defendant and the suit
could not be continued against his personal representative. We do not think, however, that the doctrine of this
case applies to an involuntary proceeding in bankruptcy.
Such a proceeding, not being in the nature of a coinmon law action, is not abated by any rule of the common
law. And while there is no express provision in the Bankruptcy Act ' that the cause of action survives the death
of a petitioner before adjudication, we think that such
survivorship accords with the "substance of the cause
of action" and the nature and purpose of a proceeding in
bankruptcy, which is not a mere personal action, but is
essentially in the nature of a proceeding in rem for the
benefit of all the defendant's creditors. And the filing of
the petition brings his property in custodia legis, with
a view to a determination of his status and the settlement and distribution of his estate. Acme Harvester Co.
v. Beekman Lumber Co., 222 U. S. 300, 307; Lazarus v.
Prentice, 234 U. S. 263, 266. We conclude that an administrative proceeding of this character, in which the
property of the defendant is impounded for the benefit
of all of his creditors, does not abate because of the death
of the petitioner before adjudication and that its prosecution may be continued by his personal representative.
The motions of the defendants to dismiss the proceeding
by reason of Shugert's death are accordingly denied; and
the administrator is granted leave to be substituted as the
petitioner in the proceeding and to prosecute it in his
stead.
2. This brings us to the consideration, on the merits,
of the motions made by the defendants in the District
'Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544.

Court to dismiss Shugert's petition in so far as it sought
the adjudication of the partnership and of themselves
as bankrupts. The petition combined, in an anomalous
and modified fashion, a " debtor's petition" and a "partnership petition " (Bankruptcy Forms, Nos. 1 and 2),
with other averments. In it Shugert alleged that the
partnership was insolvent and owed debts in excess of
$1,000; that each of the partners was insolvent and they
were unable, jointly or severally, to pay the partnership
debts; that he and the partnership were willing to surrender their property for the benefit of their creditors and
desired to obtain the benefits of the bankruptcy law;
and that the defendants had not offered to join in the
petition and he was not informed of their intention in
the matter. It did not allege that either the partnership
or the defendants had committed any act of bankruptcy.
The prayer was that Shugert, the partnership, and the
defendants individually, be adjudged bankrupt; that process be served upon the defendants; and that proceedings
be had as provided by the bankruptcy law and General
Order No. 8.
The defendants, who appeared specially, moved to dismiss the petition as against the partnership and themselves on the grounds, among others, that it was not authorized by the Bankruptcy Act and that the court had
no authority under it to adjudge either the partnership
or non-consenting partners bankrupt.2 The orders of the
District Court denying these motions were affirmed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the
petition was maintainable under ยง 5 of the Bankruptcy
Act and General Order No. 8.
Section 5a of the Bankruptcy Act specifically provides
that "A partnership, during the continuation of the partnership business, or after its dissolution and before the
Two of the defendants also denied that they were members of
the partnership.

final settlement thereof, may be adjudged a bankrupt."
There hence can be no doubt that a partnership may be
adjudged a bankrupt as a distinct legal entity. But since
the Act does not specify when it may be adjudged a
bankrupt, to determine this question reference must be
had to the general provisions of the Act, in which, in accordance with ยง 1(19), the word "persons" is to be construed as including "partnerships." The Act makes provision for only two kinds of petitions upon which a person
may be adjudged bankrupt; one, a voluntary petition
filed by him; the other, an involuntary petition filed
against him by creditors. As to the first, it is provided
that any qualified person, except certain specified corporations, may file a petition to be adjudged a voluntary bankrupt, ยงยง 4, 59a; and as to the second, that creditors having provable -claims of a specified amount against an
insolvent debtor who has committed an act of bankruptcy
within the preceding four months, may file a petition to
have him adjudged a bankrupt, ยงยง 3b, 59b.3 As there is
no other provision authorizing the filing of a petition in
bankruptcy, it necessarily results that there is no authority under the Act to adjudge a partnership bankrupt
except upon its own voluntary petition or upon an involuntary petition filed against it by creditors; and none to
make such an adjudication upon a petition filed against
it by one of its members.
There is nothing in ยง 5c of the Bankruptcy Act, upon
which the administrator relies, that has any application
to this question. It merely provides that the court of
bankruptcy which has jurisdiction of one of the partners
may have jurisdiction of all the partners and of the administration of the partnership and individual property;

At least three creditors are required unless all the creditors are
less than twelve in number, in which case one creditor may fie the

that is, it goes solely to the question of venue or jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court with reference to its territorial limits. See ยง 2. And the decision in Francis v.
McNeal, 228 U. S. 695, only involved the question whether
in a bankruptcy proceeding in which a partnership had
been adjudged bankrupt under an involuntary petition
filed against it by creditors, the court might administer
the separate estate of a partner who had not been adjudged bankrupt individually.
It is clear that the present petition cannot be sustained
as the voluntary petition of the partnership for its own
adjudication in bankruptcy. It was filed and signed by
Shugert alone, as the sole petitioner. It did not purport
to be filed by the partnership, and was not signed by it
or in its behalf. And while there was an incidental averment that the partnership desired to obtain the benefit of the bankruptcy law, there was no allegation that
this statement was authorized by the partnership. On
the contrary it was shown that the other partners had
not joined in the petition and that their intention in reference to the matter was not known. In short, the petition was framed as an involuntary petition against the
partnership and its non-consenting members, and its
sufficiency must be tested as such. We are therefore not
called upon to determine whether a voluntary petition
filed in the name of the partnership by one member of
the firm purporting to act in its behalf, could be sustained without an affirmative showing that it was filed
at the instance or with the consent of the other partners.
It is also clear that the petition cannot be sustained as
an involuntary petition filed against the partnership
under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, since it was
not filed by creditors, the only persons authorized to file
such a petition, and furthermore did not allege that the
partnership had committed an act of bankruptcy.
It is earnestly insisted, however, that the right of a
partner to file such a petition against the partnership is

Opinion of the Court.

recognized by General Order in Bankruptcy No. 8. This
General Order provides that any member of a partnership who refuses to join in a petition to have the partnership declared bankrupt shall be entitled to resist the petition in the same manner as if it had been filed by a
creditor of the partnership; that notice shall be given
to him as in the case of a debtor petitioned against; that
he shall have the right to appear at the hearings and make
proof that the partnership is not insolvent and has not
committed an act of bankruptcy, and make all defences
which any debtor proceeded against might make; and
that if an adjudication of bankruptcy is made upon the
petition, such partner shall file a schedule of his debts and
inventory of his property as required in cases of debtors
against whom an adjudication is made. 172 U. S., Appendix, p. 656. It is supplemented by Bankruptcy Form
No. 2, providing for a petition by less than all the members of a firm, alleging that they and the other partners
owe debts which they are unable to pay in full, and that
the petitioners desire to obtain the benefit of the Bankruptcy Act; and praying that the firm be adjudged bankrupt. 172 U. S., Appendix, p. 679.
It is clear that this General Order and Form contemplate that less than all the members of a partnership may
file a petition for its adjudication as a bankrupt, without
alleging either that it is insolvent or that it has committed
an act of bankruptcy, and that any member of the partnership who refuses to join in the petition may resist it
in the same manner as if the petition had been filed by
a creditor. In seeking to have the partnership adjudged
bankrupt as against the non-consenting partners resisting such an adjudication, it is manifestly an involuntary
proceeding. Meek v. Centre County Bank, supra, p. 502.
The question of the effect -of this General Order and
Form are now for the first time presented to this court
for determination.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

The authority conferred upon this court by ยง 30 of the
Bankruptcy Act to prescribe all necessary rules, forms and
orders as to procedure and for carrying the Act into
effect, is plainly limited to provisions for the execution
of the Act itself, and does not authorize additions to
its substantive provisions. West Company v. Lea, 174
U. S. 590, 599. And see Orcutt Company v. Green, 204
U. S. 96, 102.
General Order No. 8 was evidently taken from a like
general order under the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, of which
it is in the main a transcript; and Form No. 2 is largely
a copy of a corresponding form prescribed under said
earlier Act.4 The Act of 1867, however, while not providing that a partnership could be adjudged a bankrupt as a separate entity, expressly provided that its
property should be taken and administered in cases
"where two or more persons who are partners in trade
shall be adjudged bankrupt, either on the petition of
such partners or any one of them, or on the petition of any
creditors of the partners." 14 Stat. 517, c. 176, ยง 36. The
former general order and form were, therefore, appropriate methods of procedure for carrying into effect the
provision as to petitions by one of the partners. In the
present Act, however, there is no corresponding provision
for adjudging a partnership bankrupt or administering
its property upon the petition of one of the partners.
General Order No. 8 and Form No. 2, in purporting to
authorize one or less than all of the partners to file a
petition against the partnership without the consent of
the others, do not relate to the execution of any of the
provisions of the Act itself; and therefore are without
statutory warrant and of no effect.
We conclude that Shugert's petition was not maintainable against the partnership. And, a fortiori, it was not
