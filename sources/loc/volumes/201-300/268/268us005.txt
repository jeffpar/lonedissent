dertake otherwise to fix the precise position which shall
be accorded to them. This, we think, must be determined upon consideration of the circumstances of each
case and the provisions of relevant federal and local
laws-e. g., those which prescribe liens to secure or special
priority for tax claims. It also appears, plainly enough,
that all debts mentioned in Paragraph "b" must be satisfied before any payment to general creditors.
Guarantee Co. v. Title Guaranty Co., supra, declares
that the taxes of Paragraph "a" are "civil obligations,
not personal conventions, and preference was given to
them" over the wages specified by Clause (4), Paragraph
"b ". We adhere to this as a correct statement of the
general rule to be followed whenever it does not clearly
appear that the particular tax has been subordinated to
claims for wages by some relevant law.
We find no error in the action of the court below. The
cause will be remanded to the District Court for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 183.

Submitted March 9, 1925.-Decided April 13, 1925.

1. Any provision of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under
power granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably
adapted to the effective exercise of such power but solely to the
achievement of something plainly within the power reserved to
the States, is invalid and can not be enforced. P. 17.
2. Direct control of medical practice in the States is obviously beyond
the power of Congress. P. 18.
3. Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through a
taxing act, like the Narcotic Law, can not extend to matters
plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement
of a revenue measure. P. 18.

4. An act of Congress must be construed, if fairly possible, so as
to avoid not only' the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but
.also grave doubts upon that score. P. 17.
5. Section 2 of the Narcotic Law, declares it unlawful for any person
to sell, give away etc., any of the drugs mentioned in the act
except in pursuance of an order of the person to whom the article
is sold, etc., written on tn official blank, but does not apply "to
the dispensing or distribution of the aforesaid drugs to a patient
by a physician . . . . registered under this Act in the course of
his professional practice only." Held inapplicable to a case where a
physician, acting bona fide and according to fair medical standards,
gives an addict moderate amounts of the drugs for self-administration in order to relieve conditions incident to addiction. P. 16.

to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Ap-

peals affirming a conviction under the Narcotic Law.
Mr. George Turner, for petitioner.

Sub-section (a) of § 2 excepts "the dispensing or distribution of any of the aforesaid drugs to a patient by a

physician, dentist, or veterinary surgeon registered under
the Act in the course of his professional practice only."
The lower courts have engrafted on this exception without any sufficient reason the further requirement that the

dispensing or distribution must not only have been in
the course of the professional practice of the physician,
but that the drugs must have been dispensed or distributed in good faith as medicine, and not to satisfy the
cravings of an addict. Other cases holding the same
doctrine are Manning v. United States, 287 Fed. 800;
Melanson v. United States, 356 Fed. 783; Thompson v.
United States, 258 Fed. 196. The term " addict" is not
used in the entire Narcotic Act, and the only mention of

"good

faith" is found in § 8, where, after making it

unlawful for any person not registered to have in pos-

Argument for Petitioner.

session or under his control any of the drugs, a number
of exceptions are made, among which is one in favor of
those having possession of drugs which may "have been
prescribed in good faith by a physician, dentist or veterinary surgeon registered under this Act." Apart from
the difficulty of applying provisions relating to one
offense to another separate and distinct offense, there are
two other very good reasons why the good faith provision
in the above exception can have no reference to or influence in construing the exception in favor of registered
physicians provided for by sub-section (a) of § 2. The
first is the decision of this court in United States v. Jin
Fuey Moy, 241 U. S. 394, in which it was determined
that the provision of § 8 against having drugs in possession must be construed as leveled at only those required
to register and entitled to register and to procure order
blanks; and consequently the good faith provision can
have no reference to the dispensing and distribution of
drugs to people in general, because they are not entitled
to register or to procure order blanks.
Second, an exception to the having drugs in possession
cannot be imported into the exception in favor of registered physicians dispensing or distributing the drugs.
The two things are entirely different in the considerations
which govern them and in the gravity of the act as tending t< impair the revenue features of the law. A person
entitled to register, but not registered, having the drugs
in possession, may very well be considered as presumptively engaged in their clandestine distribution, and therefore to be protected in their possession only by a good
faith prescription, and the good faith of the prescription
as to him be matter of proper concern. A registered physician, on the other hand, dispensing drugs to patients
and keeping the record required, is above board at least,
whatever the motive for dispensing the drugs, and
no harm can accrue to the administration of the law by

his act, or if harm come, it is infinitesimal, and not worthy
of consideration under the maxim de minimus non curat
lex.
If the exception found in § 2 stands alone, and is not
influenced by anything except the general purpose of the
law, what dispensing or distribution of drugs to patients
may be reasonably considered as "in the course of his
professional practice only?" That question, we submit,
cannot be answered by the application of any hard and
fast rule.
It is the business of the physician to alleviate the
pain and suffering of patients as well as to effectuate
their cure. If we are to believe the literature on the subject, the suffering of an addict caused by deprivation of
his customary drug, is as intense as any suffering caused
by disease. It is perhaps more so in the insistent demand for relief. Why should not the physician in the
course of his ordinary practice take cognizance of that
fact and administer temporary relief? It is, we submit,
a strained construction of the law to hold that the language in question was intended to prohibit such an act,
especially in view of the fact that the entire frame-work
of the law shows that it was intended, not to regulate
health and morals, but to make regulations with respect
to the drug traffic which would keep it above board for
the benefit of States and municipalities which do have
authority and duty in that direction.
The indictment states no offense even under the construction of the Narcotic Act prevailing in. the lower
courts. There is nothing in it to negative that the drugs
here were dispensed in good faith in the ordinary course
of professional practice. It is a well-known fact that
one of the means of treating addiction to morphine, or
any of the habit-forming drugs, is the administration of
diminishing quantities of the drug until the addict is
finally weaned away from the habit. In United States v.

LINDER v. UNITED STATES.
5

Argument for the United States.

Behrman, supra, it was only the extraordinary quantity
of the drug dispensed that enabled the court to find in
the acts charged in the indictment an infraction of the
law.
If the mere catering to a diseased appetite in the matter,
of narcotic drugs, even where such catering has no tendency to impair the revenue features of the Narcotic Act,
or so slight a tendency as to be negligible, be held to be
within the prohibition of that Act,. then the said Act to
that extent is clearly unconstitutional.
The Solicitor General, Assistant Attorney General
Donovan, and Mr. Harry S. Ridgely, Attorney in the
Department of Justice, for the United States.
The writ of certiorari should be dismissed on the
ground that it was improvidently granted. The sole
question now presented is whether the indictment states
an offense which Congress had the constitutional power
to create. Neither in the trial court nor in the Circuit
Court of Appeals did petitioner in anywise assail the
validity of the indictment. It was his duty to have
raised the alleged constitutional issue in the trial court,
and in the event of, an- adverse ruling, availed of the
statutory right to bring the case here for review on writ
of error under § 238 of the Judicial Code. Ex parte

508, 509; Grant Bros. v. United States, 232 U. S. 647, 661.
Petitioner contends in substance that if the indictment
and the statute upon which it is founded be construed
as charging the administration of drugs merely to gratify
the appetite of an addict, such an offense is beyond the
power of Congress to create. This is precisely what the

indictment and the statute cover, and what this Court
intended to uphold in United States v. Behrman, 258
U. S. 280, 287, 288. The indictment is framed in the
same language as the indictment in the Behrman Case,
except for the amount of the drug alleged to have been
sold or distributed otherwise than in the course of professional practice. No distinction, however, can be made
on the ground merely of the difference between amounts
of drugs. In the Behrzman Case, this Court had before
it only the strict allegations of the indictment, and for
that purpose the amount of the drug becomes immaterial
in determining whether the indictment actually and sufficiently charges it to have been unlawfully sold or distributed.
Moreover, the case on the record shows a plain purpose on the part of petitioner not to treat the addict in
a purely professional way but merely for a money consideration, to make it possible for the addict to obtain
the drug solely for the gratification of his addiction.

ingly, wilfuily and unlawfully did sell, barter and give to
Ida Casey one tablet of morphine and three tablets of
cocaine; he knew she was addicted to habitual use of these
drugs and did not require administration of either because
of any disease other than such addiction, and he did not
dispense them for the treatment of any other disease or
condition; they were not administered by him or by any
nurse or other person acting under his direction, nor were
they consumed or intended for consumption in his presence; the amount was more than sufficient to satisfy the
recipient's cravings if wholly consumed at one time; petitioner put the drugs into her possession expecting that
she would administer them to herself in divided doses over
a period of time; they were in the form in which addicts
usually consume them to satisfy their cravings; the recipient was in no way prevented or restrained from disposing of them.
Petitioner maintains that the facts stated are not sufficient to constitute an offense. The United States submit
that, considering United States v. Behrman, 258 U. S. 280,
the sufficiency of the indictment is clear.
The trial court charged"If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
defendant knew that this woman was addicted to the use
of narcotics, and if he dispensed these drugs to her for the
purpose of catering to her appetite or satisfying her cravings for the drug, he is guilty under the law. If, on the
other hand, you believe from the testimony that the defendant believed in good faith this woman was suffering
from cancer or ulcer of the stomach, and administered
the drug for the purpose of relieving her pain, or if you
entertain a reasonable doubt upon that question, you must
give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him
not guilty."
In effect, the indictment alleges that the accused, a
duly registered physician, violated the statute by giving

LINDER v. UNITED STATES.
5

Opinion of the Court.

to a known addict four tablets containing morphine and
cocaine with the expectation that she would administer
them to herself in divided doses, while unrestrained and
beyond his presence or control, for the sole purpose of
relieving conditions incident to addiction and keeping
herself comfortable. It does not question the doctor's
good faith nor the wisdom or propriety of his action according to medical standards. It does not allege that he
dispensed the drugs otherwise than to a patient in the
course of his professional practice or for other than medical purposes. The facts disclosed indicate no conscious
design to violate the law, no cause to suspect that the recipient intended to sell or otherwise dispose of the drugs,
and no real probability that she would not consume them.
The declared object of the Narcotic Law is to provide
revenue, and this court has held that whatever additional
moral end it may have in view must "be reached only
through a revenue measure and within the limits of a
revenue measure." United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241
U. S. 394, 402. Congress cannot, under the pretext of
executing delegated power, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not entrusted to the Federal Government.
And we accept as established doctrine that any provision
of an act of Congress ostensibly enacted under power
granted by the Constitution, not naturally and reasonably
adapted to the effective exercise of such power but solely
to the achievement of something plainly within power
reserved to the States, is invalid and cannot be enforced.

In the light of these principles and not forgetting the
familiar rule, that "a statute must be construed, if fairly
possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is

unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score,"
the provisions of this statute must be interpreted and
applied.
Obviously, direct control of medical practice in the
States is beyond the power of the Federal Government.
Incidental regulation of such practice by Congress through
a taxing act cannot extend to matters plainly inappropriate and unnecessary to reasonable enforcement of a
revenue measure. The enactment under consideration
levies a tax, upheld by this court, upon every person who
imports, manufactures, produces, compounds, sells, deals
in, dispenses or gives away opium or coca leaves or derivatives therefrom, and may regulate medical practice in the
States only so far as reasonably appropriate for or merely
incidental to its enforcement. It says nothing of "addicts" and does not undertake to prescribe methods for
their medical treatment. They are diseased and proper
subjects for such treatment, and we cannot possibly conclude that a physician acted improperly or unwisely or
for other than medical purposes solely because he has dispensed to one of them, in the ordinary course and in good
faith, four small tablets of morphine or cocaine for relief
of conditions incident to addiction. What constitutes
bona fide medical practice must be determined upon consideration of evidence and attending circumstances. Mere
pretense of such practice, of course, cannot legalize forbidden sales, or otherwise nullify valid provisions of the
statute, or defeat such regulations as may be fairly appropriate to its enforcement within the proper limitations
of a revenue measure.
United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, supra, points out that
the Narcotic Law can be upheld only as a revenue measure. It must be interpreted and applied accordingly.
Further, grave constitutional doubts concerning § 8 cannot be avoided unless limited to persons who are required
to register by § 1. Mere possession of the drug creates
no presumption of guilt as against any other person.

LINDER v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

In United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86, 93, 95, a
registered physician was accused of unlawfully selling,
giving away and distributing five hundred one-sixth grain
tablets of heroin without official written order. Another
count charged selling, dispensing and distributing five
hundred such tablets not in the course of regular professional practice. The trial court held § 2 invalid because
it invaded the police power of the State. This court declared: "Of course Congress may not in the exercise of
federal power exert authority wholly reserved to the
States. . . . If the legislation enacted has some reasonable relation to the exercise of the taxing authority conferred by the Constitution, it cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it.
We cannot agree with the contention that the provisions
of § 2, controlling the disposition of these -drugs in the
ways described, can have nothing to do with facilitating
the collection of the revenue, as we should be obliged to
do if we were to declare this Act beyond the power of
Congress acting under its consttutional authority to impose excise taxes." The sharp division of the court in
this cause and the opinion in Jin Fuey Moy's Case clearly
indicated that the statute must be strictly construed
and not extended beyond the proper limits of a revenue
measure.
Webb v. UnitedStates, 249 U. S.96,99, came here on certified questions. Two were answered upon authority of
Doremus' Case. The third inquired whether a regular
physician's order for morphine issued to an addict, not in
the course of professional treatment with design to cure
the habit, but in order to provide enough of the drug to
keep him comfortable by maintaining his customary use,
is a " physician's prescription." The answer was that " to
call such an order for the use of morphine a physician's
prescription would be so plain a perversion of meaning
that no discussion of the subject is required." The lower

268 U. S.

court had sought instruction in order that it might decide
the particular cause. The question specified no definite
quantity of drugs, nor the time intended for their use.
The narrated facts show, plainly enough, that physician
and druggist conspired to sell large quantities of morphine
to addicts under the guise of issuing and filling orders.
The so-called prescriptions were issued without consideration of individual cases and for the quantities of the
drugs which applicants desired for the continuation of
customary use. The answer thus given must not be construed as forbidding every prescription for drugs, irrespective of quantity, when designed temporarily to alleviate an addict's pains, although it may have been issued
in good faith and without design to defeat the revenues.
This limitation of the reply is confirmed by Behrman's
Case, 258 U. S. 280, (infra) decided three years later,
which suggests at least that the accused doctor might have
lawfully dispensed some doses.
In Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U. S. 189, 194,
doctor and druggist conspired to sell opiates. The prescriptions were not issued in the course of professional
practice. The doctor became party to prohibited sales.
"Manifestly the phrases 'to a patient' and 'in the
course of his professional practice only' are intended to
confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcotic drugs mentioned in the Act, strictly
within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to
a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite
or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the
drug. A 'prescription' issued for either of the latter
purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor
the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it."
The quoted laiguage must be confined to circumstances like those presented by the cause. In reality, the
doctor became party to sales of 'drugs. lie received a

fixed sum per dram under guise of issuing prescriptions.
The quoted words are repeated in Behrman's Case, which
recognizes the possible propriety of prescribing small
quantities.
United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250, 253, 254, holds"It is very evident from a reading of it [ § 2] that the emphasis of the section is in securing a close supervision of
the business of dealing in these dangerous drugs by the
taxing officers of the Government and that it merely uses
a criminal penalty to secure recorded evidence of the disposition of such drugs as a means of taxing and restraining the traffic."
United States v. Behrman, 258 U. S. 280, 287, came up
under the Criminal Appeals Act. The indictment
charged that Behrman, a registered physician, did unlawfully sell, barter and give to one King, an "addict," one
hundred and fifty grains of heroin, three hundred and
sixty grains of morphine and two hundred and ten grains
of cocaine, by issuing three prescriptions. Further, that
the drugs were not intended or required for treatment of
any disease or condition other than such addiction, but
for self-administration over a period of several days. The
question was, "Do the acts charged in this indictment
constitute an offense within the meaning of the statute?"
And replying, this court said"The District Judge who heard this case was of the
opinion that prescriptions in the regular course of practice did not include the indiscriminate doling out of narcotics in such quantity to addicts as charged in the indictment. . . . In our opinion the District Judge who
heard the case was right in his conclusion and should
have overruled the demurrer. Former decisions of this
court have held that the purpose of the exception is to
confine the distribution of these drugs to the regular and
lawful course of professional practice, and that not everything called a prescription is necessarily such. [Webb v.

Opinion of the Court.

are cited.] . . . It may be admitted that to prescribe
a single dose, or even a number of doses, may not bring
a physician within the penalties of the Act; but what is
here charged is that the defendant physician by means of
prescriptions has enabled one, known by him to be an
addict, to obtain from a pharmacist the enormous number of doses contained in 150 grains of heroin, 360 grains
of morphine, and 210 grains of cocaine "-three thousand
ordinary doses!
This opinion related to definitely alleged facts and
must be so understood. The enormous quantity of drugs
ordered, considered in connection with the recipient's
character, without explanation, seemed enough to show
prohibited sales and to exclude the idea of bona fide professional action in the ordinary course. The opinion cannot be accepted as authority for holding that a physician,
who acts bona fide and according to fair medical standards, may never give an addict moderate amounts of
drugs for self-administration in order to relieve conditions incident to addiction. Enforcement of the tax demands no .such drastic rule, and if the Act had such scope
it would certainly encounter grave constitutional difficulties.
The Narcotic Law is essentially a revenue measure and
its provisions must be reasonably applied with the primary view of enforcing the special tax. We find no facts
alleged in the indictment sufficient to show that petitioner had done anything falling within definite inhibitions or sufficient materially to imperil orderly collection
of revenue from sales. Federal power is delegated, and
its prescribed limits must not be transcended even though
the end seem desirable. The unfortunate condition of
the recipient certainly created no reasonable probability
that she would sell or otherwise dispose of the few tablets
entrusted to her; and we cannot say that by so dispens-
