Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

Mr. Jerome Michael, with whom the Solicitor General
and Messrs. A. A. McLaughlin, Alex Koplin, Henry Gale
and Arthur M. Loeb were on the brief, for petitioner in
Nos. 786 and 787.
Messrs. N. B. Barnwell and Godfrey Goldmark for
respondent, in Nos. 786 and 787.
Mr. Godfrey Goldmark, for petitioner in No. 1085,
submitted.
The Solicitor General, Mr. Assistant Attorney General
Letts and Mr. Harvey B. Cox, Special Assistant to the
Attorney General, for the United States, submitted in
No. 1085.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The first and second of these cases are claims for freight,
storage and demurrage proved in bankruptcy proceedings by the federal agent, for which the agent asserts
priority on the ground that such claims arising during
federal control of the railroads in 1918 are debts due to
the United States and are preferred by Rev. Stats. § 3466
and by the Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, § 64,
amended by Acts of February 5, 1903, c. 487, § 14, 32
Stat. 800, and June 15, 1906, c. 3333, 34 Stat. 267. The
third is a claim by the United States for amounts paid
by the Postmaster General to the bankrupts for bills of
exchange and checks drawn by the bankrupts and unpaid, together with protest fees, &c., as to which priority
is asserted on the same grounds. The priority was denied in the first two cases by the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit. 1 Fed. (2d) 860; ibid. 864. But
it was allowed in the Second Circuit without any reported
opinion, following an earlier case in that Circuit, In re
Tidewater Coal Exchange, 280 Fed. 648.

DAVIS v. PRINGLE.

Opinion of the Court.

All the three cases depend upon the question whether
the Government has a right to the priority it claims.
If that is denied the additional inquiries that would be
necessary before the federal agent could prevail in the
railroad cases need not. be gone into. Therefore we take
up that first. It may be assumed that the priority must
be found if at all in the Bankruptcy Act and in its supposed incorporation of Rev. Stats. § 3466. That Act,
as was said in Guarantee Title & Trust Co. v. Title
Guaranty & Surety Co., 224 U. S. 152, 160, "takes into
consideration .
.
the whole range of indebtedness
of the bankrupt, national, state and individual, and assigns the order of payment." It was passed with the
United States in the mind of Congress as is shown by
the exception of debts due as taxes levied by the United
States from the discharge in § 17-a(1), the limitation on
debts owing to the United States as a penalty in § 57-j,
and the provisions as to priority in § 64 with which we
are principally concerned. By 'a' of that section "The
court shall order the trustee to pay all taxes legally due
and owing by the bankrupt to the United States
in advance of the payment of dividends to creditors."
This taken by itself would seem to exclude other debts.
But the section goes on in' b' to give priority in the order
named to "(5) debts owing to any person who by the
laws of the States or the United States is entitled to
priority," and the Government argues that by § 1(19)
'persons' shall include corporations and that the United
States is a corporation and therefore within these words.
Being within them, it is said, it is entitled to priority
by a law of the United States, the well known Rev. Stat.
§ 3466. It is said that no other person except the United
States itself can be discovered who is given the right by
its laws.
We attach little value to this logical concatenation as
against the direct effect of § 64, taken according to the

normal usages of speech. It. is incredible that after the
conspicuous mention of the United States in the first
place at the beginning of the section and the grant of a
limited priority, Congress should have intended to smuggle in a general preference by muffled words at the end.
The States are mentioned in (5) before the United
States, showing that their laws were primarily in mind.
The United States seems added to avoid some possibly
overlooked case. The ordinary dignities of speech would
have led to the mention of the United States at the beginning of the clause, if within its purview. Elsewhere in
cases of possible doubt when the Act means the United
States it says the United States. We are of opinion that
to extend the definition of 'person' here to the United
States would be 'inconsistent with the context' and
therefore is within the exception at the beginning of § 1.
We are confirmed in our opinion by the fact that in
earlier bankruptcy acts a priority was given to the United
States in express terms, and that., for instance in the
Act of March 2, 1867, c. 176, § 28; 14 Stat. 517, 530,
'Fifth', persons entitled to priority by the laws of the
United States are mentioned when the United States
could not have been meant, having been fully secured by
the same section, 'Second.' If it be legitimate to look
at them (Schall v. Camors, 251 U. S. 239, 250) the bills
that were before Congress when the present law was
passed contained the clause relied upon but showed by
their context that they could not refer to the United
States. There was a change of purpose from that of
the earlier acts. Guarantee Title & Trust Co. v. Title
Guaranty& Surety Co., 224 U. S. 152, 158, et seq. Public opinion as to the peculiar rights and preferences due
to the sovereign has changed. We agree with the view
of this point taken by the Chief Justice and Justices Van
Devanter and Clarke in United States Shipping Board
Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Wood, 258 U. S. 549,
