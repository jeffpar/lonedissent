Crown Orchard Co. v. Dennis, 229 Fed. 652, was a suit
by the grantee of standing timber to-enjoin the cutting
and conversion of the timber,-in effect, a suit to prevent
waste. There was no attempt to enforce any contractual
obligation; and the court very naturally held that the case
did not fall within the exception in § 24 of the Judicial
Code. It was expressly assumed by the court that if the
suit had been to enforce a.contract or for specific performance, the rule would have been otherwise.
The distinction is between a cause of action arising out
of the ownership or possession of property transferred by
the assignment of a contract,-in which case the remedy
accrues to the person who has the right of property or of
possession at the time,-and a suit to enforce the obligations of the assigned contract. Deshlerv. Dodge, 16 How.
622, 631; Ambler v. Eppinger, 137 U. S. 480. The present
suit falls within the latter class. It is brought, not to
recover property or to redress an injury to property which
appellant had acquired through an assignment of a lease,
but to enforce contractual obligations of the lease. No
direct relief is sought in respect of appellant's lands conveyed as security, and they are affected only collaterally
and incidentally. See Kolze v. Hoadley, supra.

ON CERTIFICATE FROM CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 231.

Argued March 18, 1925.-Decded May 25, 1925.

1. A person of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may not legally
be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of § 4 of the Act of
June 29, 1906, as amended May 9, 1918, 34 Stat. 601, 40 Stat. 542;

Syllabus.

2. The seventh subdivision, supra, in permitting "any alien" who
has rendered specified military or maritime service and fulfills other
prescribed conditions, on presentation of the required declaration
of intention, to petition for natural'zation without proof of 5 years'
residence in the United States; and in permitting "any alien"
serving in the forces of the United States during the time the
country was engaged in the late war to file his petition without
such declaration or such proof of residence, was not intended in
those cases to eliminate the distinction made in Rev. Stats. § 2169
based on color or race, but, like earlier acts using the same phrase,
refers to aliens who might, consistently with that distinction, become citizens. P. 409.
3. In § 2 of the above Act of 1918, providing that nothing in
the Act shall repeal or in any way enlarge Rev. Stats. § 2169 "except as specified in the seventh subdivision of this Act and under
the limitation therein defined," the exception does not imply an
intention to depart from the race or color distinction of § 2169 as
to the aliens mentioned in the seventh subdivision but refers to
the provision there made for naturalization of native-born Filipino service men. Id.
4. Prior to the Act of 1906, supra, citizens of the Philippine Islands
were not eligible to naturalization under Rev. Stats. § 2169, because not aliens and therefore not within its terms. P. 410.
5. The Act of 1906, supra, § 30 of which extends the naturalization
laws, with some modifications, to "persons not citizens who owe
permanent allegiance to the United States and who may become
residents of any State or organized Territory of the United States,"
did not disturb the distinction based on race or color, in Rev. Stats.
§ 2169. P. 411.
6. Prior to the Act of 1918, supra, Filipinos not being "free white
persons" or "of African nativity" were not eligible to citizenship
of the United States; but an effect of that act was to authorize
the naturalization of those native-born Filipinos, of whatever race
or color, having the qualifications specified in § 4, subdiv. seventh.
Id.
7. The Act of July 19, 1919, supra, provided that "any person of
foreign birth " who served in the forces in the late war should
under certain conditions, "have the benefits of" the seventh subdivision of § 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, supra, as amended.
Held that "any person of foreign birth" is not more comprehensive than "an alien" in the latter act. P. 412.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Argument for Appellant.

268 U. S.

QUESTIONS certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals,
arising upon an appeal by Toyota from a decree of the
District Court (290 Fed. 971) canceling his certificate of
naturalization in a proceeding brought by the Government for that purpose under the Naturalization Act.

Mr. Laurence M. Lombard, for appellant.
The necessary inference from the repealing clause, Act
of 1918, § 2, is that in subdivision 7 we shall find some
class specified which but for the words "except as specified" would be restricted by Rev. Stats. § 2169. Obviously this must refer to a class of persons who under
prior laws were not subject to naturalization. Brown v.
Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 at page 438.
Looking at subdivision 7, what persons are specified?
None of its provisions has any bearing on the question
except as they show that every provision of the 7th subdivision has in view the speedy naturalization of those engaged in any public service of the United States having
relation to the conduct of the war. The natural meaning
of these words is that any Filipino and any alien and
any Porto Rican, all having the qualifications set forth,
are the persons " specified" in the 7th subdivision.
As both Filipinos and Porto Ricans were already eligible to naturalization and needed nothing to save them
from the limitation of Rev. Stats. § 2169, the words "except as specified" must have had reference to "any
aliens" as the class as to which. that section was repealed
or enlarged.
This construction of the Act of May 9, 1918, is the only
one which will give effect to all the words. From the
language, it is clear that Congress intended to enlarge
§ 2169 as to certain persons. That section does not set
forth the qualifications necessary to obtain naturalization, but states the races to whom the privileges of naturalization are limited. Therefore, any enlargement of it

'TOYOTA v. UNITED STATES.
402

405

Argument for Appellant.

must extend the privileges of naturalization to some race
or races not heretofore eligible-not to all members of
the race, released from the limitations of § 2169, but
only to those bearing the qualifications required by subdivision 7.
The Government has argued that the addition was
solely the inclusion of Filipinos and Porto Ricans. This
cannot havw been the fact because Filipinos and Porto
Ricans could already be naturalized under § 30 of the
Act of June 29, 1906, and therefore as to them any addition would be unnecessary and superfluous. In re Bautista, 245 Fed. 765; In re Giralde, 226 Fed. 826; In re
Mallari, 239 Fed. 416; In re Monico Lopez, Naval Digest
1916, p. 207 (Supreme Court of D. C. 1915); 27 Op.
Atty. Gen. 12; Letter of Solicitor Gen. Davis to Secretary of Labor, January 4, 1916, reaffirming opinion of
Atty. Gen. Bonaparte.
All other aliens except Asiatics could of course be
naturalized under § 2169; so, unless the words "except
as specified" refer to*"any aliens" as specified in subdivision 7 and these words in turn include in their meaning "Asiatics," the entire exception becomes superfluous.
The words "any alien" as used in the naturalization laws
are nowhere defined, and retain their natural meaning.
The Act of 1918 repealed part of the Act of June 30,
1914, and part of the Act of June 25, 1910, restating the
repealed parts but omitting in the re-enactment of the
Act of 1914 significant words used in the former act.
Such omission implies an alteration in the purpose. As
the language of the Act of May 9, 1918, is clear, congressional debates and committee reports are not admissible
to influence the interpretation.
The weight of authority is in favor of the naturalization of the appellant. The records of the Bureau of
Naturalization show that at least eighty-seven Asiatics
have been naturalized in continental United States under

406

Opinion of the Court.

268 U. S.

the Acts in question divided among ten naturalization districts. All but nine of these were naturalized prior to
the enactment of the statute of July 19, 1919. In addition two hundred and thirteen Asiatics were naturalized
by the United States District Court for the District of
Hawaii.
The construction placed upon a statute by an executive department charged with its administration is entitled to great weight. The fact that, after the war was
over and the need for further recruits had ceased, the Department altered the interpretation formerly placed on
the Act of 1918, is of little value in showing the construction contemporaneously with its passage. Aliens
having rendered military service upon promise of citizenship should not later have the citizenship withdrawn.
Appellant is entitled to naturalization under the Act
of July 19, 1919.

the Solicitor General was on the brief, for appellee.
MR.

JUSTICE

BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

Hidemitsu Toyota, a person of the Japanese race, born
in Japan, entered the United States in 1913. He served
substantially all the time between November of that year
and May, 1923, in the United States Coast Guard Service.
This was a part of the naval force of the United States
nearly all of the time the United States was engaged in
the recent war. He received eight or more honorable
discharges, and some of them were for service during the
war. May 14, 1921, he filed his petition for naturalization in the United States district court for the district of
Massachusetts. The petition was granted, and a certificate of naturalization was issued to him. This case arises
on a petition to cancel the certificate on the ground that

it was illegally procured. § 15, Act of June 29, 1906, c.
3592, 34 Stat. 596, 601. It is agreed that if a person
of the Japanese race, born in Japan, may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision of § 4 of the Act of
June 29, 1906, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1918, c.
69, 40 Stat. 542, or under the Act of July 19, 1919, c. 24,
41 Stat. 222, Toyota is legally naturalized. The district
court held he was not entitled to be naturalized, and
entered a decree canceling his certificate of citizenship.
290 Fed. 971. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court
of Appeals, and that court under § 239, Judicial Code,
certified to this court the following questions: (1)
Whether a person of the Japanese race, born in Japan,
may legally be naturalized under the seventh subdivision
of § 4 of the Act of June 29, 1906, as amended by the
Act of May 9, 1918, and (2) whether such subject may
legally be naturalized under the Act of July 19, 1919.
The material provisions of these enactments are printed
in 'the margin.*

years and upward who has declared his intention to become a citizen

Until 1870, only aliens being free white persons were
eligible to citizenship. In that year, aliens of African
nativity and persons of African descent were made eligible. See Ozawa v. United States, 260 U. S. 178, 192.
The substance of prior legislation is expressed in § 2169,
Revised Statutes, which is: "The provisions of this Title
[Naturalization] shall apply to aliens being free white
persons, and to aliens of African nativity and to persons
of African descent." A person of the Japanese race, born
in Japan, is not eligible under that section. Ozawa v.
United States, supra, 198.
It has long been the rule that in order to be admitted
to citizenship, an alien is required, at least two years
prior to his admission, to declare his intention to become
a citizen, and to show that he has resided continuously
in the United States for at least five years immediately
preceding his admission. Revised Statues, §§ 2165, 2170;
tion without proof of the required five years' residence within the
United States if upon examination . . . it is shown that such
residence cannot be established; any alien serving in the military
or naval service of the United States during the time this country
is engaged in the present war may file his petition for naturalization
without making the preliminary declaration of intention and without
proof of the required five years' residence within the United States;
§ 2 . . . Nothing in this Act shall repeal or in any
way enlarge section twenty-one hundred and sixty-nine of the Revised
Statutes, except as specified in the seventh subdivision of this Act

(Act of May 9,
and under the limitation therein defined:
1918, c. 69, 40 Stat. 542, 547.)
"Any person of foreign birth who served in the military or naval
forces of the United States during the present war, after final examination and acceptance by the said military or naval authorities, and
shall have been honorably discharged after such acceptance and service, shall have the benefits of the seventh subdivision of section 4 of
as amended, and shall not be

subd. 1, § 4, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596. But at different times,
as to specially designated aliens serving in the armed
forces of the United State , Congress modified and lessened these requirements. § 2166, Revised Statutes (Act
of July 17, 1862, § 21, c. 200, 12 Stat. 594, 597); Act of
July 26, 1894, c. 165, 28 Stat. 123, 124; Act of June 30,
1914, c. 130, 38 Stat. 392, 395. In each of the first two
of these acts, the phrase "any alien" is used as a part
of the description of the person for whose benefit the
act was passed. In the last, the language is "any
alien . . . who may, under existing law, become a citizen
of the United States." Prior to this act, it had been held
that the phrase "any alien," used in the earlier acts, did
not enlarge the classes defined in § 2169, In re Buntaro
Kumagai, (1908) 163 Fed. 922; In re Knight, (1909) 171
Fed. 299; Bessho v. United States, (1910) 178 Fed. 245;
In re Alverto, (1912) 198 Fed. 688. The language used
in the Act of 1914 merely expresses what was implied in
the earlier provisions.
The seventh subdivision of § 4, of the act of 1918, permits "any native-born Filipino" or "any alien, or any
Porto Rican not a citizen of the United States" belonging respectively to the classes there described, on presentation of the required declaration of intention, to petition for naturalization without proof of five years' residence within the United States; and the act permits " any
alien" serving in the forces of the United States "during the time this country is engaged in the present war"
to file his petition f.or naturalization without making the
preliminary declaration of intention and without proof
of five years' residence in the United States. The act of
1919 gave" any peison of foreign birth" there mentioned,
the benefits of the seventh subdivision of § 4. Evidently,
a principal purpose of these acts was to facilitate the naturalization of service men of the classes specified. There
is nothing to show an intention to eliminate from the

268 U. S.

definition of eligibility in § 2169 the distinction based
on color ox race. Nor is there anything to indicate that,
if the seventh subdivision stood alone, the words "any
alien" should be taken to mean more than did the same
words when used in the acts of 1862 and 1894. But § 2
of the act of 1918 provides that nothing in the act shall
repeal or in any way enlarge § 2169 "except as specified
in the seventh subdivision of this Act and under the limitation therein defined." This implies some enlargement
of § 2169 in respect of color and race; but it also indicates a purpose not to eliminate all distinction based on
color and race so long continued in the naturalization
laws. If it was intended to make such change and to extend the privilege of naturalization to all races, the provision of § 2 so limiting the enlargement of § 2169 would
be inappropriate. And if the phrase "any alien " in the
seventh subdivision is read literally, the qualifying words
being free white persons " and " of African nativity " in

§ 2169 are without significance. See In re Para,269 Fed.
643, 646; Petitionof Charr, 273 Fed. 207, 213.
When the act of 1918 was passed, it was doubtful
whether § 30 of the act of 1906 extended the privilege of
naturalization to all citizens of the Philippine Islands.
They were held eligible for naturalization in In re Bautista, 245 Fed. 765, and in In re Mallari, 239 Fed. 416.
And see 27 Op. Atty. Gen. 12. They were held not eligible in In re Alverto, 198 Fed. 688, in In re Lavmpitoe, 232
Fed. 382, and in In re RalIos, 241 Fed. 686. But we hold
that until the passage of that act, Filipinos not being
"free white persons" or "of African nativity" were not
eligible, and that the effect of the act of 1918 was to make
eligible, and to authorize the naturalization of, nativeborn Filipinos of whatever color or race having the qualifications specified in the seventh subdivision of § 4.
Under the treaty of peace between the United States
and Spain, December 10, 1898, 30 Stat. 1754, Congress

TYOYOTA v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

was authorized to determine the civil rights and political
status of the native inhabitants of the Philippine Islands.
And by the act of July 1, 1902, § 4, c. 1369, 32 Stat. 691,
692, it was declared that all inhabitants continuing to reside therein who were Spanish subjects on April 11, 1899,
and then resided in the Islands, and their children born
subsequent thereto, "shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine Islands and as such entitled to the
protection of the United States, except such as shall have
elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain,"
according to the treaty. .The citizens of the Philippine
Islands are not aliens. See Gonzales v. Williams, 192
U. S. 1, 13. They owe no allegiance to any foreign government. They were not eligible for naturalization under
§ 2169 because not aliens and so not within its terms.
By § 30 of the Act of 1906, it is provided: "That all the
applicable provisions of the naturalization laws of the
United States shall apply to and be held to authorize the
admission to citizenship of all persons not citizens who
owe permanent allegiance to the United States, and who
may become residents of any State or organized Territory
of the United States, with the following modifications:
The applicant shall not be required to renounce allegiance
to any foreign sovereignty; he shall make his declaration
of intention to become a citizen of the United States at
least two years prior to his admission; and residence within the jurisdiction of the United States, owing such permanent allegiance, shall be regarded as residence within
the United States within the meaning of the five years'
residence clause of the existing law." (34 Stat. 606.)
Section 26 of that act repeals certain sections of Title
XXX of the Revised Statutes, but leaves § 2169 in force.
It is to be applied as if it were included in the act of 1906.
Plainly, the element of alienage included in § 2169 did not
apply to the class made eligible by § 30 of the act of 1906.
The element of color and race included in that section

412

Opinion of the Court.

268 T. S.

is not specifically dealt with by § 30, and, as it has long
been the national policy to maintain the distinction of
color and race, radical change is not lightly to be deemed
to have been intended. "Persons not citizens who owe
permanent allegiance to the United States, and who may
become residents of any State" may include Malays, Japanese and Chinese and others not eligible under the distinction as to color and race. As under § 30 all the
applicable provisions of the naturalization laws apply, the
limitations based on color and race remain; and the class
made eligible by § 30 must be limited to those of the color
and race included by § 2169. As Filipinos are not aliens
and owe allegiance to the United States, there are strong
reasons for relaxing as to them the restrictions which do
not exist in favor of aliens who are barred because of their
color and race. And in view of the policy of Congress to
limit the naturalization of aliens to white persons and to
those of African nativity or descent the implied enlargement of § 2169 should be taken at the minimum. The
legislative history of the act indicates that the intention
of Congress was not to enlarge § 2169, except in respect
of Filipinos qualified by the specified service. Senate Report No. 388, pp. 2, 3, 8. House Report No. 502, pp. 1, 4,
Sixty-fifth Congress, Second Session. See also Congressional Record, vol. 56, part 6, pp. 6000-6003. And we
hold that the words "any alien" in the seventh subdivision are limited by § 2169 to aliens of the color and race
there specified. We also hold that the phrase "any person of foreign birth " in the act of 1919 is not more comprehensive than the words "any alien" in the act of 1918.
It follows that the questions certified must be answered
in the negative.
The answer to the first question is: No.
The answer to the second question is: No.
