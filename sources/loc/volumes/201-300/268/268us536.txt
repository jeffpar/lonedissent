prived of patronage. But the injunctions here sought are
not against the exercise of any proper power. Plaintiffs
asked protection against arbitrary, unreasonable and unlawful interference with their patrons and the consequent
destruction of their business and property. Their interest
is clear and immediate, within the rule approved in Truax
v. Raich, Truax v. Corrigan and Terrace v. Thompson,
supra, and many other cases where injunctions have issued
to protect business enterprises against interference with
the freedom of patrons or customers. Hitchman Coal &
Coke Co. v. Mitchell, 245 U. S. 229; Duplex Printing
Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443; American Steel Foundries v. Tri-City Central Trades Council, 257 U. S. 184;

The suits were not premature. The injury to appellees
was present and very real, not a mere possibility in the
remote future. If no relief had been possible prior to the
effective date of the Act, the injury would have become
irreparable. Prevention of impending injury by unlawful action is a well recognized function of courts of equity.

MARR v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 236.

Argued November 19, 1924; restored to docket for reargu-

ment January 5, 1925; reargued March 12, 1925.-Decided June
1, 1925.
A Delaware corporation, organized for the purpose, took over the
assets and continued the business of a New Jersey corporation,
assuming its liabilities, after an exchange of stock, as follows:
The New Jersey corporation had outstanding $15,000,000 of 7%
preferred and $15,000,000 common stock, all shares of the par
value of $100, and had accumulated a large surplus from profits,

the actual value of the common stock being $842.50 per share;
the Delaware corporation had an authorized capital of $20,000,000
in 6% non-voting preferred stock and $82,600,000 in common,
shares all of the par value of $100, and exchanged five shares of
its common stock for every like share in the New Jersey corporation, and one and one-third shares of its preferred stock for every
like share in the New Jersey corporation, making payments in
cash to avoid fractional certificates; and thus all the stock of the
New Jersey corporation was exchanged, except a few shares of
preferred stock redeemed in cash, and the Delaware corporation
had $7,600,000 of authorized common stock remaining which was
sold or held for sale for additional capital. Held that the new
securities thus received by an old stock-holder were not in effect
a stock dividend; and that their value above the cost of his exchanged securities, bought by him prior to March 1, 1913, was
taxable as income under the Act of September 8, 1916, and within
the power of Congress so to tax, since the corporations were essentially different, being organized in different States and with different rights and powers, and since the shares exchanged represented different interests both because of these differences in the
corporations and because a 6% non-voting preferred stock differs
essentially from a 7% voting preferred stock, and common stock
subject to the priority of $20,000,000 preferred and a $1,200,000
annual dividend charge differs essentially from a common stock
subject only to $15,000,000 preferred and a $1,050,000 annual dividend charge. Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 159, and Weiss v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1924.
Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

268 U. S.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Prior to March 1, 1913, Marr and wife purchased 339
shares of the preferred and 425 shares of the common
stock of the General Motors Company of New Jersey for
$76,400. In 1916, they received in exchange for this stock
451 shares of the preferred and 2,125 shares of the common stock of the General Motors Corporation of Delaware which (including a small cash payment) had the
aggregate market value of $400,866.57. The difference
between the cost of their stock in the New Jersey corporation and the value of the stock in the Delaware corporation was $324,466.57. The Treasury Department ruled
that this difference was gain or income under the Act of
September 8, 1916, c. 463, Title I, §§ 1 and 2, 39 Stat.
756, 757; and assessed, on that account, an additional income tax for 1916 which amounted, with interest, to $24,944.12. That sum Marr paid under protest. He then
appealed to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by filing a claim for a refund; and, upon the disallowance of
that claim, brought this suit in the Court of Claims to
recover the amount. Judgment was entered for the
United States. 58 Ct. Cl. 658. The case is here on appeal
under § 242 of the Judicial Code.
The exchange of securities was effected in this way.
The New Jersey corporation had outstanding $15,000,000
of 7 per cent. preferred stock and $15,000,000 of the common stock, all shares being of the par value of $100. It
had accumulated from profits a large surplus. The actual
value of the common stock was then $842.50 a share. Its
officers caused to be organized the Delaware corporation,
with an .authorized capital of $20,000,000 in 6 per cent.
non-voting preferred stock and $82,600,000 in common
stock, all shares being of the par value of $100. The
Delaware corporation made to stockholders in the New

Jersey corporation the following offer for exchange of
securities: For every share of common stock of the New
Jersey corporation, five shares of common stock of the
Delaware corporation. For every share of the preferred
stock of the New Jersey corporation, one and one-third
shares of preferred stock of the Delaware corporation. In
lieu of a certificate for fractional shares of stock in the
Delaware corporation payment was to be made in cash at
the rate of $100 a share for its preferred and at the rate
of $150 a share for its common stock. On this basis all
the common stock of the New Jersey corporation was exchanged and all the preferred stock except a few shares.
These few were redeemed in cash. For acquiring the
stock of the New Jersey corporation only $75,000,000 of
the common stock of the Delaware corporation was
needed. The remaining $7,600,000 of the authorized common stock was either sold or held for sale as additional
capital should be desired. The Delaware corporation,
having thus become the owner of all the outstanding stock
of the New Jersey corporation, took a transfer of its assets
and assumed its liabilities. The latter was then dissolved.
It is clear that all new securities issued in excess of an
amount equal to the capitalization of the New Jersey corporation represented income earned by it; that the new
securities received by the Marrs in excess of the cost of
the securities of the New Jersey corporation theretofore
held were financially the equivalent of $324,466.57 in
cash; and that Congress intended to tax as income of
stockholders such gains when so distributed. The serious
question for decision is whether it had power to do so.
Marr contends that, since the new corporation was organized to take over the assets and continue the business
of the old, and his capital remained invested in the same
business enterprise, the additional securities distributed
were in legal effect a stock dividend; and that under the
rule of Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, applied in

Weiss v. Steam, 265 U. S. 242, he was not taxable thereon
as income, because he still held the whole investment.
The Government insists that identity of the business
enterprise is not conclusive; that gain in value resulting
from profits is taxable as income, not only when it is represented by an interest in a different business enterprise
or property, but also when it is represented by an essentially different interest in the same business enterprise
or property; that, in the case at bar, the gain actually
made is represented by securities with essentially different characteristics in an essentially different corporation;
and that, consequently, the additional value of the new
securities, although they are still held by the Marrs, is
income under the rule applied in United States v. Phellis,
257 U. S. 156; Rockefeller v. United States, 257 U. S. 17d;
and Cullinan v. Walker, 262 U. S. 134. In our opinion
the Government is right.
In each of the five cases named, as in the case at bar,
the business enterprise actually conducted remained
exactly the same. In United States v. Phellis, in Rockefeller v. United States and in Cullinan v. Walker, where
the additional value in new securities distributed was held
to be taxable as income, there had been changes of
corporate identity. That is, the corporate property, or a
part thereof, was no longer held and operated by the
same corporation; and, after the distribution, the stockholders no longer owned merely the same proportional
interest of the same character in the same corporation.
In Eisner v. Macomber and in Weiss v. Stearn, where the
additional value in new securities was held not to be
taxable, the identity was deemed to-have been preserved.
In Eisner v. Macomber the identity was literally maintained. There was no new corporate entity. The same
interest in the same corporation was represented after the
distribution by more shares of precisely the same character. It was as if the par value of the stock had been

reduced, and three shares of reduced par value stock had
been issued in place of every two old shares. That is,
there was an exchange of certificates but not of interests.
In Weiss v. Stearn a new corporation had, in fact, been
organized to take over the assets and business of the old.
Technically there was a new entity; but the corporate
identity was deemed to have been substantially maintained because the new corporation was organized under
the laws of the same State, with presumably the same
powers as the old. There was also no change in the
character of securities issued. By reason of these facts,
the proportional interest of the stockholder after the distribution of the new securities was deemed to be exactly
the same as if the par value of the stock in the old
corporation had been reduced, and five shares of reduced
par value stock had been issued in place of every two
shares of the old stock. Thus, in Weiss v. Stearn, as in
Eisner v. Macomber, the transaction was considered, in
essence, an exchange of certificates representing the same
interest, not an exchange of interests.
In the case at bar, the new corporation is essentially
different from the old. A corporation organized under
the laws of Delaware does not have the same rights and
powers as one organized under the laws of New Jersey.
Because of these inherent differences in rights and powers,
both the preferred and the common stock of the old corporation is an essentially different thing from stock of the
same general kind in the new. But there are also adventitious differences, substantial in character. A 6 per cent.
non-voting preferred stock is an essentially different thing
from a 7 per cent. voting preferred stock. A common
stock subject to the priority of $20,000,000 preferred and
a $1,200,000 annual dividend charge is an essentially
different thing from a common stock subject only to
$15,000,000 preferred and a $1,050,000 annual dividend
charge. The case at bar is not one in which after the
