BULLEN v. WISCONSIN.
240 U. S.

Statement of the Case.

As it follows that the judgment below in so far as it
compelled the railroad to pay the second time the sum
which it had discharged under the Virginia judgment
was erroneous, it must be reversed and the case remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
And it is so ordered.

BULLEN v. STATE OF WISCONSIN.
ERROR TO THE COUNTY COURT 'OF WAUKESHA
STATE OF WISCONSIN.
No. 262.

COUNTY,

Argued March -8, 1916.-Decided April 10, 1916.

A deed made by a resident of one State to a person of another State
as trustee for certain beneficiaries of personal property consisting of
stocks and bonds, donor retaining income for life and power of appointment, and providing that no portion of principal or income be
paid over to any person before the donor's death unless by his direction, held not to amount to a transfer of the properUY, and the courts
of the donor's State did not err in sustaining the imposition of an
inheritance tax under the law of that State on the whole fund as
upon a transfer intended to take effect in enjoyment after the donor's
death.
A case is on one side of a statutory line or the other; and if on the
safe side, it is none the worse legally because the full measure of
what the law permits is availed of; to condemn an act as an evasion
it must be on the wrong side of the line as indicated by the policy
if not by the mere letter of the law.
Notwithstanding such deed of trust and that the trustee had possession
in tfe other State of the certificates of stock and bonds and that
State had imposed an inheritance tax thereon owing to the situs
thereof, held that the imposition of the inheritance tax by the State
in which the donor resided was not unconstitutional either as impairing the obligation of contract or as depriving the beneficiaries of
their property without due process of law.

The transfer taxed by Wisconsin became effective not
under the laws of Wisconsin, but solely under the laws of
another jurisdiction, and the tax violates the Fifth and
Fourteenth Amendments. Nunnemacher v. State, 129

Pabst, 139 Wisconsin, 561; Re Bullen, 143 Wisconsin, 512.
The transfer transaction occurs under or by virtue of,
or the right to receive property is derived through, the
laws of Wisconsin. The State has no extra-territorial
jurisdiction. Bliss v. Bliss, 221 Massachusetts, 201;

A decedent's personal property in a foreign jurisdiction
will be subject, in a proper case, to taxation both at home
and in the foreign State, if the laws of both States are
requisite to the legal transfer of the property at the owner's
death and it does not matter that the machinery of the
law would not need to be invoked in the particular case
(Blackstone v. Miller, 188 U. S. 189; Mann v. Carter, 74
N. H. 345; Hopkins' Appeal, 77 Connecticut, 644); but
an inheritance tax cannot be levied by any State unless
the operation of its law is necessary in order to effect the
transfer. Walker v. Mansfield, 109 N. E. Rep. 647; Re

Inasmuch as the transfer transaction in this case could
be carried to completion "without the aid of Wisconsin
law," there was no transfer transaction or right to receive
property under Wisconsin law. The right or privilege
taxed by Wisconsin did not exist, and judgment against a
citizen of the United States for a tax on something which
does not exist, deprives him of his property without due
process of law and takes his private property for public
use without just compensation. Union Transit Co. v.

The reason which exempts from inheritance taxation
real property in a State foreign to its owner's domicile
applies with equal force to the personal property held under trust assignment. Real estate in a foreign jurisdiction
is never subject to an inheritance tax at the domicile- of its
owner. Cases supra and see Connell v. Crosby, 210 Illinois,
380; Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278; Clarke v. Clarke, .178

It is within the power of any citizen of the United States
to fix the situs of his personal property at a place other
than his domicile.
The judgment levying the Illinois Inheritance Tax being
entitled. to full faith and credit is conclusive on the Wisconsin courts as to the law under which the transfer transaction became effective. Cases supra.
The assignment in trust having been made upon actual
consideration as not a gift but a valid contract and the
law taxing it impairs the obligation of the contract.
Gelsthorpe v. Furnell, 20 Montana, 299; Chanler v. Kelsey,
205 U. S. 466.
The levy of tax by Wisconsin on the amount already
paid for the inheritance tax in Illinois is erroneous because
the amount so paid never passed to the pJaintiffs in error.
A tax upon this deprives them of their property without
due process of law. United States v. Perkins, 163 U. S.

BULLEN v. WISCONSIN.
240 U. S.

Opinion ofthe Court.

Mr. Walter Drew, with whom Mr. Walter C. Owen,
Attorney General of the State of Wisconsin, was on the
brief, for defendant in error.
MR.JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a proceeding to fix the inheritance tax upon
the estate of George Bullen, deceased, a resident of Wisconsin. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed a
judgment for a tax upon a fund of nearly a million dollars
which the heirs and next of kin say cannot be taxed in
Wisconsin without violating the Fourteenth Amendment
and the contract clause of the Constitution of the United
States. 143 Wisconsin, &12.
The facts are simple. Bullen" formerly had lived in
Chicago and continued to do some business there after
moving to Wisconsin, which he did in 1892. He kept
in Chicago the bonds, stocks and notes constituting the
fund and in 1902 conveyed them to the Northern Trust
Company of that City upon certain, trusts. In 1904 by
virtue of powers reserved he repossessed himself of the
fund, but in 1907 he conveyed it to the company upon
the former trusts, again. The limitations, so far as material, were of relatively small sums to a sister and niece
residing in Massachusetts, .and, subject to those gifts,
of one-third of the income to his widow for life and the
rest of the income and the principal to his four sons. But
the instrument contained the following clause: "Fifth.
I, the donor, expressly reserve the right tb direct and
control the disposition of the said trust property and
estate, to revoke and vacate this trust at any time during
my life, to enter into and upon and take possession of
the same, or.any part thereof, to require a reconveyance
to me of the said trust property, or any part thereof, and
to dispose of it as I may see fit. During my lifetime the
principal and income shall be used for such beneficiaries

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

and in such manner as I may from time to time appoint,
and in default of any appointment during my lifetime,
and, at all events, after my death, the said income and the
said principal shall be applied, paid over or held as herein
provided.". It also declared that no portion of principal
or income should be paid under some of the leading clauses
before Bullen's death unless by his direction. In fact he
received the whole income during his life. The Supreme
Court held that an inheritance tax was due in respect
of the whole fund as upon 'a transfer intended to take
effect in enjoyment after the donor's death.
The deeds of trust were not a merely simulated transaction. Bullen made a will shortly after the first transfer,
which was of similar tenor but which, it is found, 'has
not been probated,' perhaps because the parties relied
upon the deeds. The deeds transferred title and they
had a purpose. Bullen at the time was suffering from
locomotor ataxia, his wife also was in precarious health
and the chief instrument contemplated the possible disability of both. The ultimate limitations would operate
unless revoked, which they were not. But Bullen, as has
been seen, reserved an absolute power of control over
all of his gifts and exercised it during his life by a revocation, (followed, to be sure, by a reconveyance upon
the same terms), and by taking all the income of the
fund. The words of Lord St. Leonards apply with full
force to the present attempt to escape the Wisconsin
inberitance tax, "To make a distinction between a general
power and a limitation in fee, is to grasp at a shadow
while the substance escapes." Sugden, Powers, 8th Ed.,
396. See Gray, Perpetuities, § 526b, 1st Ed., pp. 334, 335.
We do not speak of evasion, because, when the law draws
a line, a case is on one side of it or the other, and if on the
safe side is none the worse legally that a party has availed
himself to the full of what the law permits. When an
act is condemmed as an evasion what is meant is that it

Opinion of the Court.

is on the wrong side of the line indicated by the policy
if not by the mere letter of the law. What we do say is
that the Supreme Court of Wisconsin was fully justified in
treating Bullen's general power of disposition as equivalent
to a fee for the purposes of the taxing statute, that there
is no constitutional objection to its doing so, and that
although Illinois also has taxed the fund, as it might, we
are not aware that it has attempted to qualify the effect
that Wisconsin has given to the power, and do not intimate that it could have done so, if it had tried. See
Hawley v. Malden, 232 U. S. 1, 13.
The power to tax is not limited in the same way as the
power to affect the transfer of property. If this fund
had passed by intestate succession it would be recognized
that by the traditions of our law the property is regarded
as a universitas the succession. to which is incident to the
succession to the persona of the deceased. As the States
where the property is situated, if governed by the common
law, generally recognize the law of the domicil as determining the succession, it may be said that, in a practical
sense at least, the law of the domicil is needed to establish
the inheritance. Therefore the inheritance may be taxed
at the place of domicil, whatever the limitations of power
over the specific chattels may be, as is especially plain
in the case of contracts and stock. Blackstone v. Miller,
188 U. S. 189, 204. Eidman v. Martinez, 184 U. S. 578,
586, 589, 590, 592. Thomson v. Advocate General, 12 Cl.

universal succession established by will, and the notion
of privity or identity of person that is recognized in these
cases has been, carried over to more limited bequests and
in some degree to deeds. Norcross v. James, 140 Massachusetts, 188. The principle that allows the tax is to be

applied, if ever, to a disposition that operates upon the
great mass of the donor's estate and that takes effect only
,upon his death, at least so far as concerns the persons before this court, the donor's widow and sons. Lines's Estate, 155 Pa. St. 378.
It is suggested that there was a subordinate error in
not deducting the amount of the Illinois inheritance tax.
But this appears not to have been assigned in the appeal
to the Suprvme Court of the State, and therefore we need
not inquire whether there was any constitutional obstacle
to the State of Wisconsin adopting the gross fund disposed
of rather than the net amount received as the measure
of the tax.
Judgment affirmed.

Argued February 23, .1916.-Decided April 10, 1916.

Whether the contract based on a bill of lading of an interstate shipment
issued pursuant to the Act to Regulate Commerce has been discharged is a Federal question.
Transportation, as regulated by the Act to Regulate Commerce, includes the services of a connecting carrier as warehouseman of the
goods after arrival at point of destination and'before actual delivery
to the consignee.
Retention by the carrier of part of an interstate shipment, after arrival at destination, notice to, and payment of the freight by, the
consignee, held in this case to be a terminal service forming part of
the transportation in the sense of, and governed by,'the Act to Regulate Commerce.
With respect to service governed by the Act to Regulate Commerce,
the rule that both carrier and shipper are bound by, and cannot
alter, the terms of service as fixed by the filed regulations, applies
