GUERINI STONE CO. v. P. J. CARLIN CONSTRUCTION CO.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
PORTO RICO.
No. 78.

Argued November 12, 1915.-Decided February 21, 1916.

In the case of sub-contracts, as in other cases of written agreements,
a reference to an extraneous writing for a particular purpose makes
it a part of the agreement for that purpose only.
In this case, held that the general contract between the Government
and the contractor was not admissible as against a sub-contractor
except for the specific purpose mentioned in the subcontract, to wit;
showing what drawings and specifications were referred to therein,.
nor was the sub-contractor bound by provisions in the general contract so as to be obliged to submit to delays resulting from the
action of the Government permitted by the original contract.
Where a contractor agrees with a sub-contractor to provide labor
and materials not included in the sub-contract he assumes an obligation not conditioned on the question of his fault; and whether the
delay in supplying such labor and materials be attributable to him
or to the exercise by the owner of a right reserved by the principal
contract, he remains liable under the sub-contract.
In this case held that although the principal contract between the
Government and the contractor gave the Government the right to
suspend, as the contractor had not safeguarded himself by incorporating that provision into the sub-contract, he was not relieved
from the damages caused the sub-contractor by such suspension.
In estimating profits that might be realized if a building contract had
been. proceeded with in the ordinary manner to completion, no more
definite and certain method can be adopted than to deduct from
the contract price the probable cost of furnishing the materials and
doing the work.
A provision in a sub-contract requiring the contractor to make monthly
payments not exceeding 85% of cost of work erected cannot be
construed to require precisely that percentage; nor can a provision
that the sub-contractor furnish requisitions of the amount to be
paid make the sub-contractor sole judge of the amount it is en-

titled to receive. Such provisions must receive reasonable construction.
Where the form of a request to instruct is such that compliance with
it might mislead the jury, there is no error in refusing it.
THE facts, which involve the rights and liabilities of a
sub-contractor on government work, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Edward S. Paine for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Francis H. Dexter for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY delivered the opinion of the court..
We have here under review a judgment for damages
in favor of plaintiff in error (also plaintiff below) against
defendant in error (also defendant below), reversal being
asked upon the ground that, through erroneous rulings
made by the trial judge, the recovery was unduly limited.
The -writ of error was sued out under § 244, Jud. Code
(act of March 3, 1911, c. 231; 36 Stat. 1087, 1157), prior
to the act of January 28, 1915 (38 Stat. 804, c. 22, §§ 3
and 6).
Defendant, a corporation of the State of New York,
on December 12, 1910, secured a contract with the Government of the United States for the construction of a
post-office and court building at San Juan, Porto Rico.
A few days later it entered into a sub-contract in writing
with one Guerini, by the first paragraph of which he
agreed: "To furnish and set in position, including the
concrete backing, all the imitation of sandstone, and to
construct the interior concrete walls, concrete floors,
concrete roof, backing the granite construction, enclosing.
all the I beams
agreeable to the drawings and
specifications made by the said architect (copies of which
have been delivered to the Sub-Contractor), and to the
dimensions and explanations thereon, therein and herein

contained, according to the true intent and meaning of
said drawings and specifications," etc.; it being agreed
that the work should be done "under the direction and
to the satisfaction of the General Contractors and James
Knox Taylor, Architect (acting as Agents of the Owner)
or his, or its representative."
A subsequent paragraph reads as follows:
"25th. The Sub-Contractor further agrees to furnish
the material and build the concrete footing complete to
the basement floor for the sum of $6.70 a cubic foot.
"Also to furnish the materials and build all the sidewalks for the sum of $1.85 a square yard.
"Also set in position all the granite walls, steps, balusters, buttresses and curbing, and all other granite work
for the sum of 40 cents a square foot surface. The three
above items to be at the option of the general contractor.
"
Thereafter the plaintiff corporation was formed under
the laws of Massachusetts, and Guerini ti:ansferred the
contract to it. Defendant was notified of this, expressed
satisfaction in writing under date-February 20, 1911, and
thereafter dealt with plaintiff as sub-contractor.
At a later time, defendant exercised the third only of
the options given to it by the twenty-fifth paragraph.
The plan of the building contemplated a foundation of
concrete and piles, which was to be constructed by defendant complete to the basement floor; above this a
basement story, surfaced with granite blocks to be furnished by defendant (as a practical matter, to be sent
from the United States) and to be set in position by plaintiff under the accepted option. The blocks were to be
backed with concrete, to be furnished and set by plaintiff.
Above the basement story, the exterior walls were to be
faced with imitation sandstone, backed with concrete,
which together with interior walls, floors, and roof of
concrete were to be constructed by plaintiff.

GUERINI STONE CO. v. CARLIN.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The contract contained the following clauses that bear
upon the matters in dispute:
"6th. The Sub-Contractor shall and will proceed with
the said work and every part and detail thereof in a
prompt and diligent manner, . . . and shall and
will wholly finish the said work according to the said
drawings and specifications and this contract in 300 days
from the date upon which the building is ready to receive
his work and after he has been notified to proceed by
General Contractors, and in default thereof, the SubContractor shall pay the General Contractors the sum
of twenty dollars. for every day thereafter that the said
work shall remain unfinished as and for liquidated damages. The Sub-Contractor further agrees to begin work
at the building within three days from the time that he is
notified by the General Contractors that the building is
ready to receive such work.
"7th. . . . Should the Sub-Contractor be obstructed or delayed in the prosecution or completion of the
work by neglect, delay or default of the Owner, the
Architect, the General Contractors, or of any other contractors employed by them upon the work, or by alterations which may be required in said work, or by any damages which might happen by fire, lightning, earthquake, or
cyclone, or by the abandonment of the work by the employees through no fault of the Sub-Contractor, then the
time herein fixed for the completion of the work shall be
extended for a period equivalent to the time lost by reason
of any or all of the causes aforesaid," etc.
"11th. The General Contractors will provide all labor
and materials not included in this contract in such manner
as not to delay the material progress of the work, and in
the event of failure so to do, thereby causing loss to the
Sub-Contractor, agree that they will reimburse the SubContractor for sdch loss; and the Sub-Contractor agrees
that if he shall delay the material progress of the work so

as to cause any damage for which the General Contractors
shall become liable, then he shall make good to the
General Contractors any such damage over and above
any damage for general delay, herein otherwise provided;
the amount of such loss or damage in either case, to be
fixed and determined by the Architect, or by arbitration,
as provided in Article 3rd in this.contract.
"12th. It is hereby mutually agreed by the parties
hereto that the sum to be paid by the General Contractors
to the Sub-C6ntractor for said work and materials shall
be sixty-Tour thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars
($64,750.00) subject to additions or deductions as hereinbefore provided, and that such sum shall be paid in current
funds by the General Contractors to the Sub-Contractor
in monthly payments on account, not to exceed in amount
85 per cent. of the cost of the work actually erected in the
building, provided that the Sub-Contractor furnishes to
the General Contractors a written requisition, on a form
to be supplied by the General Contractors, not less than
twelve days before payment is required, * *
The action was commenced .in June, 1912. The complaint, besides the jurisdictional averments, alleged the
making of the contract between Guerini and defendant,
the assignment to plaintiff and defendant's consent and
recognition of plaintiff as the contracting party; averred
that thereafter and during the month of February, 1911, at
defendant's request and in pursuance of the terms of the
contract, plaintiff employed and sent to Porto Rico its
representatives, brought laborers from the United States
and employed others in Porto Rico, organized its working
forces, purchased and supplied the necessary tools and
materials, and prepared itself and was ready and willing to
perform its obligations under the contract, but that
thereafter until the sixteenth day of October, 1911, plaintiff was not permitted by defendant to proceed with the
work, owing to defendant's failure to provide the neces-

sary granite -blocks; that on that day plaintiff did proceed
with all possible diligence and performed all the work
provided for by the contract as fast as defendant in the
course of construction work permitted plaintiff to do so;
that nevertheless during the period from October 16, 1911,
until March 9, 1912, the work was unreasonably and unjustifiably delayed by the failure of defendant to provide
necessary materials and carry on its part of the construction work so as to permit plaintiff to perform the work required of it under the contract, and that plaintiff was
thereby greatly damaged; that on March 9, 1912, all work
of every nature was stopped on the building, and plaintiff
was prevented by defendant from continuing with any
work;-that said stoppage "has continued ever since, is
still continuing, and . * . will continue for a period
of at least several months hereafter," and thatbdefendant
has accordingly committed a breach of its obligations
under the contract, the result of which has been and is to
cause great damage and loss to plaintiff, which has been
obliged to keep its labor force on hand during all of said
period at great loss'and expense; that by the terms of the
contract payment of not more than 85% of the amount of
the work actually done was due and payable by defendant
monthly on 12 days' notice from plaintiff to defendant, and
that plaintiff during the months of December, 1911, and
January and February, 1912, duly notified and dvmanded
of defendant payment of the sums due for the work
actually performed, but that defendant continuously and
repeatedly failed and refused to make said payments; that
because of said repeated violation and breach of the
contract on the part of defendant, plaintiff, under date of
May 22, 1912, notified defendant in writing of its election
to terminate the 'contract and bring its action for damages
for breach thereof; and that plaintiff has offered to defendant to arbitrate their differences, but that defendant has
refused. Plaintiff claimed damages to the amount of

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.

240 U. S.

$45,797.45 for work and labor performed, materials
furnished, and moneys expended in and about the performance of the contract, and for lost profits. In a
separate paragraph an indebtedness of about $40,000
was alleged, for the reasonable value of work, labor, and
materials supplied.
Defendant answered, admitting some of the averments
of the complaint, but denying that plaintiff had complied
with the terms of the contract or had been prevented by
defendant from proceeding with and carrying oi, its work;
admitting that plaintiff notified defendant of its election
to cancel or rescind the contract and bring its action for
damages for the alleged breach thereof, but denying that
there was cause for rescission, and denying that plaintiff
had sustained damages as claimed by it. The answer
further set up that the sub-contract was subject to all the
terms and conditions of the principal contract made
between defendant and the Government of the United
States; that defendant had at all times proqeeded strictly
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the latter
contract, that during the course of the construction of the
building the representatives of the Government found it
desirable or necessary to change the manner of constructing the foundations, and that this action of the Government was within its rights under the original contract, and
plaintiff was bound thereby equally with defendant.
The case was tried before the judge of the District
Court and a jury. Plaintiff introduced evidence tending
to support the material averments of its complaint. It appeared that in January, 1911, defendant rnotified plaintiff's
predecessor that "work must start at once," and that in
February plaintiff sent its representatives to Porto Rico;
that upon their arrival so little work had been done upon
the foundations that they were unable to do anything upon
the building itself, but preliminary work was done in the
way of getting tools and machinery to the Island, building

Opinion of the Court.

workshops and an office, and preparing moulds for the
casting of the artificial stone; that during the spring and
summer delay was occasioned by the failure of defendant
to construct the foundations; that this continued until
about the first week in October, when the foundation work
and the grading inside the foundation walls had proceeded to a point that would admit of the commencement
of the course of granite, and enough granite was upon the
ground to allow a start to be made of setting it. In August
or September plaintiff was notified of defendant's acceptance of the option to call upon plaintiff to set the granite
at 40 cents per square foot, but the granite was slow in
arriving, and some of the stones were misfits, so that the
work of laying was considerably interrupted. There was
difficulty also with the derrick equipment, defendant
having under the contract furnished two derricks and an
engine, but with insufficient power to admit of operating
both derricks at the same time. This was remedied, some
time. in -December, by the provision of additional power.
The granite setting proceeded from the middle of October
to February 12, 1912, plaintiff's evidence being to the
effect that it was set as fast as delivered, but that because
the granite came in separate shipments, a little at a time,
sometimes with needed blocks missing, the work of setting
it could not be speeded. On or about February 12, 1912,
plaintiff stopped setting granite, with defendant's consent.
The evidence tended to show that much of the delay
during the spring and summer of 1911 was occasioned by a
change made by arrangement between defendant and the
Government in the provisions of the general contract
respecting the mode of constructing the foundations. The
pleader would seem to have limited the complaint respecting delay prior to October 16, 1911, to such as was due
to defendant's failure to provide granite blocks, but the
evidence was not thus limited.
In February, 1912, when the granite work had been

practically finished, it was ascertained that the foundations had settled, and that there were variations in the
foundation work from the specifications as agreed upon
between the Government and-'defendant. On March 9
work was suspended by order of the Government, pending
an investigation which resulted in showing that practically
the entire building would have to be underpinned in order
to secure a safe foundation. This result was officially
communicated to defendant under date March 25, 1912,
and a few days later, pursuant to an order of the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury, all work upon the building was
stopped "pending the settlement of responsibility for'
deviations from contract requirements regarding foundations." The question of responsibility lay between defendant and the representatives of the Government; plaintiff
having had nothing to do with the foundations. Leaving
the question undetermined, the Government, in the month
of May, 1912, entered into an agreement with defendant
for underpinning the entire building. It perhaps does not
clearly appear when this work was commenced, but it was
in progress when the action was begun, and Mr. Berryman, the Government's superintendent of construction
then in charge of the building, testified: "This work is now
[November, 1912] about 85 per cent. completed." The
same witness testified that from March 9, 1912, until the
time of the trial, "conditions were such that it was impossible for the Guerini Stone Company to continue with
their work under the contract."
On March 9, 1912, plaintiff's agent at San Juan was
notified by defendant's representative there that the
Federal authorities had ordered all work upon the building
suspended pending investigation of the foundations. On
the same day he wrote defendant's San Juan office asking
whether plaintiff's men should be discharged and sent back
to the United Statos, but got no satisfactory reply. Further correspondence upon the same topic led to no result.

GUERINI STONE CO. v. CARLIN.

240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Meanwhile, the parties had been in disagreement about
payments on account. The contract (paragraph 12) provided for payment of the contract price "in monthly
payments on account, not to exceed in amount 85 per
cent. of the cost of the work actually erected in the building, provided that the Sub-Contractor furnishes to the
General Contractors a written requisition, on a form to be
supplied by the General Contractors, not less than twelve
days before payment is required," etc. The contract,
however, did not provide how the cost of the work other
than the granite setting should be ascertained. For the
concrete backing and other concrete work and the imitation sand-stone covered by the sub-contract, no "unit
prices" were specified. The price of "6.70 a cubic foot,"
mentioned in the twenty-fifth paragraph
as the optional
price for concrete footings, was treated by the parties as
if intended to read $6.70 per cubic yard-approximately
25 cents per cubic foot. This, however, had reference to
work that plaintiff was not called upon to do, and obviously did not furnish a unit price, for the concreting
actually done by plaintiff.
In December, 1911, and January, 1912, plaintiff made
written requisitions for payments on account, based upon
statements of the "amount of work completed to date."
They were not complied with, and the parties soon realized
the practical importance of agreeing upon a unit price to
be employed in estimating the amounts payable. According to the testimony of Mr. Converse, President and
Treasurer of the Guerini Company, he went from Boston
to New York City on February 2, 1912, by appointment,
and conferred with Mr. Carlin, defendant's representative,
upon the subject of unit prices, and it was then agreed that
plaintiff should make its applications and receive its
payments upon the basis of a certain written schedule of
units, produced by Mr. Carlin, which specified (inter alia):
"Exterior and interior concrete walls, arches and cement

240 U. S.

work, $1.07 per cu. ft.; Concrete floors and casings,
45 c per sq. ft." Mr. Carlin, in his testimony, denied
that such an agreement was made, but admitted that the
schedule had been agreed upon between defendant and the
Government's superintendent of construction- and used as
a basis for payments by the Government to defendant,
including payments for the work done by plaintiff under
the sub-contract.. At the interview of February 2, Mr.
Converse received a check for $3,765.50 on account, as
against $12,750.00 previously called for. Under date of
March 9th a requisition for $11,735.95 was made, and
against this a payment of $674.00 was made about two
weeks thereafter. No other payments were made to
plaintiff. It appeared, however, that for the work theretofore done by plaintiff, defendant had received from the
Government at least $13,871.25 *(a witness called by
defendant said "about $19,000"), based upon the price of
$1.07 per cubic foot for concrete. It was explained that
this unit price was fixed by the first superintendent of
construction, who had charge during the year 1911 and
the first month of the following year, and that his successor, who took charge on February 1, 1912, employed a
lower unit price, on the basis of which the Carlin Co.
had been overpaid about $8,000.
Enough has been said to indicate the situation as it
stood on May 22, 1912, on which date plaintiff wrote to
defendant reciting briefly its complaints respecting defendant's previous conduct and the stoppage of the work
and concluding as follows:
"Under these circumstances and owing to your entire
failure to comply with the terms of the contract, we
hereby notify you that we now terminate the contract and
shall proceed no further with the work, and that we shall
hold you liable for damages we have sustained by reason
of your breach of contract, including your failure to provide labor'and materials not included in the contract with

240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

us in such manner as not to delay the material progress
of our work and your failure to make payments in accordance with the terms-of the contract, and all other breaches
of contract on your part."
Defendant acknowledged receipt and, replied May 31,
1912: "Said letter is a breach of contract on your part,
and we shall immediately proceed to have the work done
by other parties, and shall charge you with the additional
expense, if any, above your contract price."
Plaintiff further produced evidence tending to show
that the moneys expended by it in and about the performance of the contract amounted to upwards of $30,000;
that if permitted to complete the contract under ordinary
conditions, its estimated profits would have been about
$9,700; and 'that defendant had taken over machinery,
tools, etc., belonging to plaintiff estimated to be worth
from $3,300 to $3,800.
Defendant to some extent disputed the facts recounted
in and inferable from plaintiff's evidence, but based its
defense principally upon the provisions of the contract
between defendant and the Government, which it was
insisted must be read into the contract between plaintiff
and defendant. Among those provisions was this:
"It is further covenanted and agreed- that the United
States shall have the right of suspending the whole or
any part of the work herein contracted to be done, whenever in the opinion of the Supervising Architect it may
be necessary for the purposes or advantage of the work,
and upon such occasion or occasions the contractor shall,
without expense to the United States, properly cover
over, secure, and protect such of the work as may be
liable to sustain injury from the weather, or otherwise;
and for all such suspensions the contractor shall be allowed one day additional to the time herein stated for
each and every day of such delay so caused in the completion of the work, the same to be ascertained 'by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

Supervising Architect; and a similar allowance of extra
time will be made for such other delays as the Supervising
Architect may find to have been caused by the United
States, provided that a written claim therefor is presented
by the contractor within ten 'days of the occurrence of
such delays; provided, further, that no claim shall be
made or allowed to the contractor for any damages which
may arise out of any delay caused by the United States."
And among the "General Conditions" prefacing the
specifications was this:
"The Department, acting for the United States, reserves the right to suspend any portion of the work embraced in the contract whenever, in its opinion, it would
be inexpedient to carry on said work."
Other contentions were made which are not now material.
The jury rendered a verdict somewhat special in form,
finding for the plaintiff and assessing its damages at
$6,609.25, "including the value of tools inventoried at
$3,000." The judge had instructed them that for certain
material and appliances used by plaintiff in carrying out
its contract, and which were placed in the custody and
charge of defendant, "credit must be given, in whatever
decision you arrive at, to the plaintiff company, and in
the uncontradicted sum of $3,000." Just how the residue
of the verdict was made, up we have no means of determining, nor is it now important.
The chief controversy here is over the admission in
evidence of the general contract, and the effect given to
it in the rulings of the trial judge, which were in substance
that the provisions of that contract, including those
above quoted, were to be read into the sub-contract,
and that for any delays which resulted from the action
of the representatives of the Government in changing
the foundations or plans of the building, in suspending
or stopping the work, or otherwise, defendant was not

GUERINI STONE CO. v. CARLIN.

Opinion of the Court.

responsible to plaintiff. To these rulings exceptions were

duly taken.
From what was said by the trial judge it would seem
that he labored under the impression that the Supervising
Architect of the Treasury was a party to the sub-contract.
This is not the case; he did not sign:the agreement, and
his name was inserted solely in the capacity of architect
or referee. And although the sub-contract very plainly
imports that it covers only a part of the work of constructing the building, and that the Carlin Company was the
general contractor, it contains no clause incorporating
into itself the provisions of the principal contract, or
even in terms referring to that instrument. The subcontractor's work was agreed to be done according to.
drawings and specifications, "copies of, which have been
delivered to the subcontractor." These copies were not
produced, nor was their non-production accounted for.
The parties seem to have assumed that the drawings and
specifications of which copies were to have been delivered
with the sub-contract were identical with those, that
formed a part of the general contract; and we adopt that
assumption.
The reference in the sub-contract-.to the drawings and
specifications was evidently for the mere purpose of indicating what work was to be done, and in what manner
done, by the sub-contractor. Notwithstanding occasional
expressions of a different view (see Shaw v. First Baptist
Church, 44 Minnesota, 22, 24; Avery v. Supervisors, 71
Michigan, 538, 546, 547; Stein v. McCarthy, 120 Wisconsin, 288, 295), in our opinion the true rule, based upon
sound reason and supported by the greater weight of

authority, is that in the case of sub-contracts, as in other
cases of express agreements in writing, a reference by the
contracting pqrties to an extraneous writing for a particular purpose makes it a part of their agreement only
for the purpose specified. Woodruff v. Hough, 9i U. S.

289; Noyes v. Butler Bros., '98 Minnesota, 448, 450;
Modern Steel Co. v. English Construction Co., 129 Wisconsin, 31, 40, 41.
In the present case, not only was the reference to the
drawings and specifications for a limited purpose, but the
sub-contract, by the express terms of its eleventh paragraph, placed upon the general contractor (defendant)
the obligation to "provide all labor and materials not
included .in this contract in such manner as not to delay
the material progress of the work." Applying this to the
facts of the case, defendant agreed to furnish the foundation in such manner that plaintiff might build upon it
without delay. This is inconsistent with any implication
that the parties intended that delays attributable to the
action of the owner should leave plaintiff remediless.
I We therefore hold that the general contract was not
admissible in evidence against plaintiff, unless for the
purpose of showing (if, indeed, it did show) what drawings
and specifications were referred to in the sub-contract;
and that the rulings of the trial judge holding plaintiff
bound by the provisions' of the general contract, so as
to be obliged to submit to delays resulting from the action
of the Government, were erroneous.
Another point that may conveniently be dealt with
here is raised by an exception taken to the instruction
that "even if there was delay in furnishing granite, there
could have been no liability under the sub-contract for
,,such delay, in money, but such a condition was to be
remedied by an extension of time for completion, as
therein provided." This was clearly erroneous. Paragraph 11 binds defendant to reimburse plaintiff for any
loss caused by delay resulting from defendant's failure to
provide materials 'not included in the sub-contract. The

granite was in this category. The trial court misapplied
Paragraph 7. The extension of time therein provided
for was intended as a dispensation, under given circumstances, of the liability to liquidated damages imposed
upon the sub-contractor by Paragraph 6 for failure to
complete his work within the time therein limited. The
purpose of Paragraph 7 is to relieve the sub-contractor.
It cannot properly be construed to deprive him of his
right under Paragraph 11 to reimbursement for losses.
attributable to delays assumed by the general contractor.
Nelson v. Pickwick Associated Co., 30 Ill. App. 333.
What has been said indicates the disposition that must
be made of another exception taken by plaintiff, which
was to the instruction that under Paragraph 7 plaintiff
was not entitled to recover damages or money compensation from defendant even though it should appear that
plaintiff "was obstructed or delayed in the prosecution
or completion of the work by the neglect, delay, or default
of the Government of the United States, the Supervising
Architect, or his representatives, or by defendant, or by
alterations required in the work, since by the provisions
of' that paragraph the only remedy of plaintiff in such
cases is the time allowance therein lrovided for; unless,
however, you should believe from the evidence that the
defendant failed to' provide labor and materials not included in the sub-contract, in such manner as to delay
the material progress of the work."
As we have shown, the failure to.furnish a foundation
upon which plaintiff's work could be superimposed was a
failure to provide "labor and materials not included in this
contract," within the meaning. of paragraph 11. To
furnish the foupdation defendant assumed an obligation
not conditioned by the question whether it was at fault
or whether the .delay was involuntary on its part because

tract. Defendant of course had notice of the Government's right to suspend the work, and could easily have
safeguarded itself against responsibility to the sub-contractor for delays attributable to the exercise of that right
by an appropriate modification of Paragraph 11 of the
sub-contract, for which presumably an allowance would
have been made to the sub-contractor in the form of an
increased price for its work or otherwise. This not having
been done, Paragraph 11 must be enforced as it is written.
It matters not whether plaintiff or its predecessor had
notice of the provision of the general contract respecting
suspension of the work, since that provision was not incorporated into the sub-contract. It must be presumed
that delays attributable to action by the Government
were among those intended to be safeguarded by Paragraph 11.
There was testimony as to the profits that plaintiff
probably would have gained if the contract had been proceeded with in the ordinary manner. But this question
was excluded from the consideration of the jury upon the
ground that the profits were contingent and speculative.
In this there was error. The testimony was from an experienced witness, and included an estimate of the total
cost to plaintiff of the doing of the work called for in the
sub-contract. This amounted to $53,012. The contract
price was $64,750. The witness testified that a profit of
$9,700 would have been made. Whether he intended to
say $11,700 was for the jury to determine. No more
definite or certain method of estimating the profits could
well be adopted, than to deduct from the contract price
the probable cost of furnishing the materials, and doing
the work. Phila., Wil. & Balt. R. R. v. Howard, 13 How.

Error is assigned to the refusal of the trial judge to give
the following instruction:

GUERINI STONE CO. P. CARLIN.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"If you find-that the defendant failed to make payments
as called for by the contract, on account of work done by
the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of the contract,
such failure constitutes -a breach of the contract on the
part of the defendant, and justified the plaintiff in stopping
work under the contract, 'and entitles it to recovery from
the defendant of such damages as may be proper oi+ the
evidence and under the instructions which the Court will
give you in that regard."
The request was evidently based upon the doctrine
illustrated in Canal Co. v. Gordon, 6 Wall. 561; Phillips
&c. Constr. Co. v. Seymour, 91 U. S. 646, 649; Norrington
v. Wright, 115 U. S. 188, 205. There is a difficulty, however, in applying that doctrine to this case, due to the
fact that the contract does not either specify the amount
of the advance payments or indicate how they are to be
ascertained. The language of Paragraph 12 is that the
contract price is to be paid "in monthly payments on
account not to exceed in amount 85% of the cost of the
work actually erected in the building, provided," etc.
'There is no clause, such as is frequently found in contracts
of this. character, that the amounts payable from time to
time shall be 'ascertained and certified by the architect.
The language cannot be construed to oblige the general
contractor to pay precisely 85% of the cost of the work
done; the use of the words "not to exceed" forbids this.
The paragraph must receive a reasonable construction,
and undoubtedly required the general contractor to make
substantial payments monthly, fairly approximating
but not exceeding 85% of the cost of the work. But the
proviso requiring the sub-contractor to furnish to the
general contractor a written requisition did not entitle
the sub-contractor to be the sole judge of the amount it
was entitled to receive. On the contrary, the provision
that the requisition should be submitted "not less than
twelve days before payment is required" evidently con-

"templated that the general contractor was to be afforded
an opportunity to verify the propriety of the demand
made. But the evidence fails to show that the requisitions were based upon the cost of the work, or that any
:clear statement of such cost was submitted with them. As
already pointed out, the parties endeavored to arrive at an
agreement about unit prices, in order that these might be
employed in making up the requisitions. Whether they
did so agree the evidence left in dispute. If the agreement was made, it was at the interview of February 2,
1912. A letter is in evidence, written by plaintiff to defendant under date of February 6, saying: "In accordance with your instruction to Mr. Converse we have made
our January requisition in the units and unit prices used
by the Government engineer. . . . We inclose formal
requisition for $9,012.50 due us under contract." But
the requisition itself was not introduced. The next and
last requisition appears to have been made under date
March 9, 1912, and this stated "Amount of work completed to date, $18,237." But such details as were furnished do not seem to bear out this estimate. In the state
of the record, we cannot say that there was error in the
refusal of the requested instruction.
Error is assigned because of*the refusal to instruct the
jury as follows:
"In estimating the recovery to which the plaintiff is
entitled, if you findhe is entitled to recover, you should
consider the reasonable expenditures incurred, the unavoidable losses incident to stoppage, the amount of work
actually performed, the amount plaintiff was actually
entitled to by reason of such work at the contract price,
and the profits which plaintiff could have made if allowed
to complete. the work under the contract."
Had the requested application of these elements of
damage been confined to the case of plaintiff being found
entitled to recover upon the theory that the contract was

rightfully terminated by the notice of May 22, 1912, we
assume it ought to have been granted. United, States v.
Behan, 110 U. S. 338; Anvil Mining Co. v. Humble, 153

U. S. 540, 551, 552; Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S. 1, 21. But,
as already pointed out, other grounds of action were declared upon: (a) defendant's failure to provide granite
blocks prior to October 16, 1911; (b) its failure between
that date and March 19, 1912, to provide necessary materials and carry on its part of the construction work; and
(c) a quantum meruit for labor performed and materials
furnished. In the event of plaintiff's recoveri being based
upon these grounds only, some of the elements indicated
in the request would not be properly applicable. The form
of the request was such that compliance with it might have
misled the jury, and hence there was no error in refusing it.
Exceptions were taken to the refusal of certain other instructions requested by plaintiff with the object of basing
a recovery of damages, including profits, upon the ground
of plaintiff having been prevented by defendant's acts
from performing its contract within the time specified or a
reasonable extension thereof, or on the ground that defendant's refusal to make payments and other breaches of
contract were so unreasonable and inexcusable as to indicate an inability or unwillingness on its part to carry out
the contract or to amount to a refusal to perform it in the
future, such as to justify plaintiff in stopping work. But

these exceptions have not been fully argued, and the requests are perhaps wanting in accuracy; hence, we pass
them without consideration.
Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS took no part in the consider-

ation or decision of this case.
