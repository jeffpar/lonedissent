the interest claimed by either complainant is sufficient in
value to confer jurisdiction, and hence the bill was properly dismissed.. It is obvious that, in the view we take

UTERHART, TRUSTEE OF STEIN, v. UNITED
STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 214, Argued January 24, 1916.-Decided April 3, 1916.
The right to succeed to property of a decedent depends upon, and is
regulated by, state law. Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U. S. 41.
The judicial construction of a will by a state court of competent jurisdiction determines not only legally but practically the extent and
character of the interests taken by the legatees.
The court of the State in which the decedent's will was probated and
having jurisdiction to construe the same, having decided that, as
to the residuary estate, the will involved in this caqe constituted a
trust continuing until after July 1, 1902, and that no beneficiary
was entitled to receive anything except on affirmative exercise of
discretion conferred upon the executors and trustees, held that the
interests of the residuary legatees were contingent and not vested
prior to July 1, 1902, within the meaning of the Refunding Act of
June 27, 1902, except as to such amounts as were actually paid to
the legatees prior to that date by the trustees in the exercise of their
discretion.
49 Ct. Cl. 709, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Refund Act of June 27, 1902, and right to recover certain
taxes paid under the War Revenue Tax of 1898 on account
of interests passing under a will, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. H. T. Newcomb, with whom Mr. Morris F. Frey was
on the brief, for appellant:
The judicial construction of the will binds the Government-in denying this the Government is making a
collateral attack upon the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,'this attack being supported by nothing
except suggestions of error.
Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, applies.
The tax could lawfully have been collected upon
amounts awarded to these legatees, in the exercise of the
discretionary power provided for in the will, only.
The Government formerly held the view maintained in
this brief..

Argument for the United States.

240 U. S.

The burden of proof to establish that the interests of the
legatees were "not absolutely vested in possession" prior
to July 1, 1902, rests'upon appellants.
Construction of Jones and Pratt decisions. They either
mean that the interest of legatees is vested in possession
when, (a) the right of creditors has been barred; or (b)
when a final administration of the estate has been effected.
On this record, it must be assumed that everything had
been done under New York laws to bar creditors and vest
right of legatees.
It must likewise be assumed that final administration of
the estate had been effected under the New York laws.
The interests of the various legatees, under paragraph 8
of the will, in the entire residuary estate, irrespective of
any question of administration, had "absolutely vested in
possession" prior to July 1, 1902.
The will must be read in connection with the New York
decree.
The burden of proof is upon the appellants on this
point also.
On any proper construction of New York decree, the
interests of the legatees were absolutely vested at the
common law.
The same result must follow under the act of June 27,
1902; for the reasons given in United States v. Fidelity
Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.

MR. JUSTICE PITNEY

delivered the opinion of the court.

This was a suit to recover succession taxes paid by
appellants under the act of June 13, 1898 (ch. 448; 30
Stat. 448, 464), on account of interests in personal property passing to the residuary' legatees under the will of
Conrad Stein, deceased. It was brought under the act of
June 27, 1902 (ch. 1160, ยง 3; 32 Stat. 406), which provides
for refunding "so much of said tax as may have been
collected on contingent beneficial interests which shall not
have become vested prior to July first, nineteen hundred
and two." The testator was domiciled in the State of
New York, and the will was probated and appellants were
appointed executors and trustees in that jurisdiction. The
residuary legatees were seven of the nine children of
testator; and at the time of his death on April 6, 1900,
sevieral of them were minors. All of the seven were living
on July 1, 1902. The youngest, Carl Stein, had not attained the age of twenty-one years on that date. The
residuary estate amounted to more than $1,000,000, and
the taxes collected with respect to it aggregated $17,130.82,
being based upon the theory that each of these legatees
took a vested seventh interest at the death of the testator.
If the taxes had been assessed on the advances actually
made by appellants as executors and trustees for the
benefit of the residuary legatees, prior to July 1, 1902,
they would have amounted to only $745.12.
One of the clauses of the will contained words bequeathing the residuary estate outright to the seven children in
equal shares; but this was qualified by inconsistent language in other clauses, and some time prior to January 16,

1902, one of the executors brought suit in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York against his co-executors
and the beneficiaries for a judicial construction of the
will, and a decree was made on the date mentioned, of
which the pertinent clauses are set forth in the margin. 1
"It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed: That it was. the intention of the said Conrad Stein, and such is the true meaning and construction of his will, that the whole of his residuary estate, real and
personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and
education of -his minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella
Stein and Carl Stein during the minorities if Carl Stein survive such
period. To that end he gave, devised and bequeathed to Emil Heuel
and Alexander Stein his executors and trustees, and to Josephine Stein,
his executrix and trustee, all his residuary estate both real and personal,
upon trust to receive the rents, issues and profits and income thereof
until his son Carl Stein attains the age of twenty-one years, and to
apply the same tG the support and education of the testator's said
minor children, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl
Stein, until they respectively -attain the age of twenty-one years, if
Carl Stein survive such period, and .on Carl Stein attaining the age of
twenty-one years, or sooner dying, the said testator gave, devised and
bequeathed the said residuary estate, both real and personal, to his
children Charlotte Truebenbach, Wilhelmina Schneider, Elizabeth
Heuel, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein in equal
shares and parts.
"The-said executors and executrix and trustees are empowered by
the said will to let and lease the said residuary real estate and to make
such repairs and improvements upon said residuary real estate as in
their judgment may be necessary. After the payment of taxes and other
expenses of the administration of the estate, they are to apply so much
of the rents of the real estate, and of the income of the personal estate
as shall be reasonable and proper, to the support and education of
the testator's said minor children during their respective minorities
as aforesaid. The rents of the real. estate are to be applied first to the
uses aforesaid, and aftei making such application the said executors
and executrix and trustees are, from time to time, whenever they
shall judge proper, to divide any surplus rents among the testator's
said children, Charlotte Truebenbach, Wilhelmina Schneider, Elizabeth Heuel, Josephine Stein, Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein in
equal proportions, the shares of any minor child to be paid to the guardian of-that child's estate.

UTERHART v. UNITED STATES.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Testator's personalty passed under the will, and the
executors and trustees proceeded under and complied
strictly with the directions contained in it, as interpreted
and construed by the decree.
The Court of Claims held (49 Ct. Cls. 709) that the
interest bequeathed by the will to the residuary legatees
was a vested estate, and not a contingent beneficial interest. Citing Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, and
United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., 222 U. S. 158.
It is very properly admitted by the Government that
the New York decree is in this proceeding binding with
respect to the meaning and effect of the will. The right
to succeed to the property of the decedent depends upon
and is regulated by state law (Knowlton v. Moore, 178
U. S. 41, 57), and itis obvious that a judicial construction
of the will by a state court of competent jurisdiction determines not only legally but practically the extent and
character of the interests taken by the legatees.
It is, however, contended that the will, as thus construed, either gave the residuary estate absolutdly to the
children by name, share and share alike, postponing pay"The said executors and executrix and trustees are further empowered from time to time during the minority of the said minor
children to pay over by way of advance to the said Charlot4e, Wilhelmina, Elizabeth, Josephine, Paula, Ella and Carl, in equal amounts
or shares, so much of the capital of the testator's residuary personal
estate, or the income thereof as in their judgment they may deem
reasonable so to pay over, the shares going to any minor children to be
paid to the guardian of that child's estate.
"It is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed: That the said executors and executrix are authorized and empowered, after Carl Stein
shall have attained the age of twenty-one years, to sell and convey from
time to time all or any part of the testator's residuary real estate.
"And it is Further Adjudged and Decreed: That the said executors
and executrix and trustees shall not be compelled to make distribution
of the principal of the estate or any part thereof, except in the exercise
of their reasonable discretion, until the said Carl Stein attains the age
of twenty-one years."

ment merely until Carl died or, reached majority, or that
it gave the estate to them absolutely when Carl died or
attained majority, meanwhile giving to each child the
income of his or her proportionate share. With this view
we cannot concur. The decree declares the true construction to be "that the whole of his residuary estate, real and
personal, should, so far as necessary, be applied to the support and education of his minor children, Josephine Stein,
Paula Stein, Ella Stein and Carl Stein during the minorities 'if Carl Stein survive such period." Then follows a
clause to the effect that the trustees should apply the income to the support and education of the minor children
until they respectively attained the age of twenty-one
years, if Carl survived such period, and that on his attaining the age of twenty-one or sooner dying the testator
gave, devised, and bequeathed the residue to the seven
named (including Carl) in equal shares. A subsequent
clause directs the executors and trustees "to apply so
much of the rents of the real estate, and of the income of the
personal estate as, shall be reasonable and proper, to the
support and education of the testator's said minor children
during their respective minorities as aforesaid." They
are empowered, during the minority of the minor children,
"to pay over by way of advance" to the seven, "in equal
amounts or shares, so much of the capital of the testator's
residuary personal estate, or the income thereof as in their
judgment they may. deem r asanable so to pay over." And,
finally, "the said executors and executrix and trustees
shall not be compelled to make distribution of the principal of the estate or any part thereof, except in the exercise
of their. reasonable discretion, until the said Carl Stein
attains the age of twenty-one years."
It will be observed not only that the trust continued
until the youngest child reached the age of twenty-one,
but that no one of the seven was entitled in the meantime
to receive anything of either principal. or income except

Syllabus.

on the affirmative exercise of a discretion conferred upon
the executors and trustees.
This having been authoritatively decided to be the true
effect and meaning of the will, we are of opinion that the
interests to which the residuary legatees succeeded were
contingent, and not vested prior to July 1, 1902, within
the meaning of the refunding act as construed in previous
decisions of this court upon the subject (Vanderbilt v.
Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, 500; United States v. Jones, 236
U. S. 106, 111; McCoach v. Pratt, 236 U. S. 562), except
with respect to such amounts as were actually paid out
of the trust fund by the trustees prior to that date, in the
exercise of their discretion; the proper tax upon which,
according to the findings, would have been $745.12.
The judgment will be reversed, and the cause remanded
with direction to enter judgment in favor of appellants
for the tax collected in excess of that amount upon the
interests of the residuary legatees.
