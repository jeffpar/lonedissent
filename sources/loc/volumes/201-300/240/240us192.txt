The description

itself suggests manifest distinctions which the. State is
entitled to observe in its taxing policy, despite the general
allegation that these associations stand "in a similar position." The State has a broad discretion as to tax exemptions (Bell's Gap R. R. v. Pennsylvania, 134 U. S. 232,
237), and the averments of the complaint are very far
from showing any basis for a charge of violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment by unwarrantable discrimination. And, finally, with respect to the, argument that the
plahitiffs in error were denied due process of law because
the state court decided the case upon the authority of the
McPhail Case, without referring to the asserted distinctions between the two cases, it is enough to say that the
cause was heard and determined, and, viewing the judgment as passing upon all the Federal questions raised, we
find no error.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS is of opinion that the writ

of error should be dismissed.

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 138. Argued December 15, 1916.-Decided February 21, 1916.

The State of Oregon did not, under § 4 of the Act of February 14, 1859,
c. 33, 11 Stat. 383, take title to sections 16 and 36, thereby granted
prior to survey; but, until defined by survey and title had vested in
the State, Congress had power to dispose of them on compensating
the State for the resulting deficiency.
Surveying the public lands is an admiinistrative act, confided by statute

to designated officers of the United States who have power to
direct how the surveys shall be made; and, until all requirements
shall have been fulfilled, a survey is not a completed official act.
Nothing in the Act of February 14, 1859, or in Rev. Stat., § 2275, as
amended by the Act of February 28, 189J, operated to pass title to
the State of Oregon of sections 16 and 36 at any intermediate stage of
the survey, or imposed any limitations on the authority of Congress'
to dispose of such lands before title passed to the State upon a survey
duly completed according to authorized regulations of the Land
Department.
A survey is incomplete until formally approved by the Commissioner;
and even though approved without modification it does not so relate
back to the date of the grant or of the field survey as to destroy
the power of Congress to dispose of the land while unsurveyed.
Authority to establish the Cascade range Forest Reservatioa given
to the President by the Acts of March 3, 1891, and June 4, 1897,
included the power to make temporary withdrawals, and a properly
made order of the Secretary of the Interior withdrawing lands must
be regarded as an act of the President.
The disposition of public lands by the President under the authority
of Congress is a disposition by Congress.
The exception in the proclamation of January 15, 1907, enlarging the
Cascade Range Forest Reserve did not include sections 16 and 36
in townships in Oregon referred to in § 4 of the Enabling Act of
1859 but which had not been included in a completed survey.
The stattitory provisions for forest reservations refer to any lands
which are subject to disposition of Congress whether surveyed or not.
Quare whether a State may await the extinguishment of a forest reserve
which includes lands granted, but title to which will not vest until
completed survey, and after such extinguishment take the granted
lands.
212 Fed. Rep. 29, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of provisions
in Federal statutes relating to sections 16 and 36 granted
to the State of Oregon, are stated in the opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of the

court.
The United States brought this suit to quiet title to
lands in section 16, township 3 south, range 6 east, Willamette Meridian, Oregon. By the Act of February 14,
1859 (c. 33, 11 Stat. 383), for the admission of Oregon
into the Union, it was provided (§ 4):
"That the following propositions be, and the same are
hereby, offered to the said people of Oregon for their free
acceptance or rejection, which, if accepted, shall be obligatory on the United States and upon the said State of
Oregon, to wit: First, That sections numbered sixteen
and thirty-six in every township of public lands in said
State, and where either of said sections, or any part thereof,
has been sold or otherwise been disposed of, other lands
equivalent thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall
be granted to said State for the use of schools.
Provided, however, That in case any of the lands herein
granted to the State of Oregon have heretofore been
confirmed to the Territory of Oregon for the purposes
specified in this act, the amount so confirmed shall be
deducted from the quantity specified in this act."
The propositions of the Enabling Act were accepted by
the legislative assembly of the State of Oregdn on June 3,
1859. 1 Lord's Oregon Laws, pp. 28, 29.
There was a stipulation of facts, in substance, as follows:
Prior to May 27, 1902, no survey of any kind had been
made by the United States Of the lands in question. On
June 2, 1902, a field survey was made under the direction
of the United States surveyor general of Oregon. This
officer approved the survey on June 2, 1903, and on
June 8, 1903, transmitted copies of plat of survey and
filed notes to the Commissioner of the General Land Office.
On October 13, 1904, the Commissioner informed the
surveyor general that the deputy had failed to describe

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.

240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the kind of instrument -used in the execution of the work
or to record any polaris or solar observations at that time,
and that a supplemental report would be necessary. Additional field notes were transmitted to the Commissioner
on September 8, 1905. The Commissioner accepted the
survey on January 31, 1906. In view of reports of illegal
settlement, it was directed that no entries should be allowed until further permission, as the survey was accepted
'for payment only.' The plat was received in the local
land office on February 7, 1906. On November 16, 1907,
the suspension was revoked ahd the surveyor general of
Oregon was directed to place the plat on file in the local
land office, and it was filed accordingly in substantially
the same form in which it had been accepted by the
surveyor general 'without change or correction.'
On December 16, 1905, the Secretary of the Interior
"temporarily withdrew for forestry purposes from" all
forms of disposition whatsoever, except under the mineral
laws of the United States, all the vacant and unappropriated public lands" within described areas which include the land in controversy. Notice of this withdrawal
was given on December 19, 1905, to the register -and
receiver of the.local land office. In taking this action the
Secretary of the Interior and the Commissioner described
the lands.'according to the rectangular system of Government survey.' On January 25, 1907, the President issued
a Proclamation enlarging the Cascade Range Forest Reserve so as to incldde the section sixteen in question and
other lands. This, proclamation, by its terms, excepted
"all lands which at this date qre embraced within any
withdrawal or reservation for any use or purpose to which
this reservation for forest uses is inconsistent." 34 Stat.
3270.
It was the contention of the Government that, by
reason of the withdrawal by Executive Order for forestry
purposes prior to the acceptance of the survey by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

Commissioner of the General Land Office, the title to the
lands did not pass to the State under the school grant.
The appellees claimed title under a conveyance from the
State, its certificates of sale having been executed on
October 10, 1906, and its deed on January 9, 1907. Decree in favor of the United States (United States v. Cowlishaw, 202 Fed. Rep. 317) was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals (Morrison v. United States, 212 Fed. Rep.
29), and the Government appeals to this court.
The first enactment for the sale of public lands in the
western territory provided for setting apart section sixteen
of every township for the maintenance of public schools
(Ordinance of 1785; Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How. 173, 177);
and, in carrying out this policy, grants were made for
common school purposes to each of the public-land
States admitted to the Union. Between the years 1802
and 1846 the grants were of every section sixteen,1 and,
thereafter, of sections sixteen and thirty-six. 2 In some
instances, additional sections have been granted. In the
case of Oregon, the following provision had been made in
establishing the Territorial Government (Act of August 14,
1848, c. 1.77, § 20, 9 Stat. 323, 330):
"That when the lands in the said Territory shall be
surveyed under the direction of the government of the
United States, preparatory to bringing the same into
market, sections numbered sixteen and thirty-six in each
Ohio (2 Stat. 175); Louisiana (2 Stat. 394, 5 Stat. 600); Indiana

Opinion of the Court.

township in said Territory shall be, and the same is hereby,
reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in
said Territory, and in the States and Territories hereafter
to be erected out of the same."
In 1850, Congress created the office of surveyor-general
of the public lands in Oregon, and provided for survey
and for donations to settlers (Act of September 27, 1850,
c. 76, 9 Stat. 496, 499) and this act provided (§ 9): "That
no claim -to a donation right . . . upon sections
sixteen or thirty-six, shall be valid or allowed, if the residence and cultivation upon which the same is founded
shall have commenced after the survey of the same."
By the Act of February 19, 1851, § 1, c. 10 (9 Stat. 568),
Congress authorized the legislative assemblies of the
Territories of Oregon and Minnesota "to make such
laws and needful regulations as they shall deem most
expedient to protect from injury and waste sections
numbered sixteen and thirty-six . . . reserved in
each township for the support of schools therein." In
1853 (Act of Jan. 7, 1853, c. 6, 10 Stat. 150) the legislative
assembly of Oregon was authorized "in all cases where
the sixteen or thirty-six sections, or any part thereof,
shall-betaken and occupied under the law making donations of land to actual settlers" to select, "in lieu thereof,
an equal quantity of any unoccupied land in sections, or
fractional sections, as the case may be." And these provisions were followed in 1859 by the proposition of the
Enabling Act '(supra) accepted by the-State of Oregon
that thes6 sections- 'in 'every township of public lands'
within the State, and 'where either of said sections, or
any part thereof, has been sold or otherwise been disposed
of, other lands -equivalent thereto, and as contiguous
as may be, shall be granted to said State for the use of
schools.'
Prior to survey, the designated sections were undefined
and the lands were unidentified. It is insisted by the

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

appellees that there was a grant in prwsenti, under which
the State acquired a vested right in the lands subject
only to identification which would relate back to the date
of the grant, and that "any sale or disposal" subsequent
to that date "was illegal and void." It will be observed,
however, that the language used is not that of a present
grant. The expression is "shall be granted," and these
words are used both with respect to the described sections and to the undefined indemnity lands which would
be received in compensation for losses. In the latter
case, there was obviously no present grant and none we
think was intended in the former. Attention is called
to the words 'herein granted' in the proviso of the Enabling Act, but this is a mere reference to what precedes
and does not change, or purport to change, the terms of
the donation. It must have been manifest to Congress,
executing this definite policy with respect to the vast
area of the public lands, that not improbably a long
period would elapse in the case of numerous townships
before surveys would be completed. Not only was it
inevitable that upon survey there would be found to be
fractional townships in which there would be either no
section sixteen, or thirty-six, or only a portion of one
or the other, but in various instances there might be prior
claims, or actual settlements, or it might appear before
surveys were had that there were important public interests which in the judgment of Congress should be subserved by some other disposition of lands of a particular
character. On the other hand, it was not important to
the State that it should receive specific lands, if suitable
indemnity were given. It was in this situation that,
in making its school grants to the public-land States,
Congress provided that the described sections, or equivalent lands if the former in whole or in part had 'been
sold or otherwise been disposed of,' should be granted.
Whether or not provision had already been made for

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the sale or disposition of public lands within the borders
of the State at the time of its admission, the language
of the school grant was substantially the same. And we
think that its import is clear. The designation of these
sections was a convenient method of devoting a fixed
proportion of public lands to school uses, but Congress
in making its compacts with the States did not undertake
to warrant that the designated sections would exist in
every township, or that, if existing, the State should at
all events take title to the particular lands found to be
therein. Congress did undertake, however, that these
sections should be granted unless they had been sold
or otherwise disposed of; that is, that on the survey,
defining the sections, the title to the lands should pass
to the State provided sale or other disposition had not
previously been made, and, if it had been made, that the
State should be entitled to select equivalent lands for
the described purpose.
By the Act of May 20, 1826, c. 83 (4 Stat. 179), there
had been provision made for compensation in the case
of townships, and fractional townships, for which the
stated appropriation for school purposes had not been
made. In 1859, a further act was passed (Feb. 26, 1859,
c. 58, 11 Stat. 385) to the effect that where settlement
with a view to preemption had been made "before the
survey of the lands in the field" on sections sixteen or
thirty-six, these sections should "be subject to the preemption claim of such settler." And it was added,-"if
they, or either of them, shall have been or shall be reserved or pledged for the use of schools or colleges in the
State or Territory in which the lands lie, other lands of like
quantity are hereby appropriated in lieu of such as may be
patented by preemptors; and other lands are also hereby
appropriated' to compensate deficiencies for school purposes where said sections sixteen or thirty-six are fractional in quantity, or where one or both are wanting by

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

240 U. S.

reason of the township being fractional, or from any
natural cause whatever." These lands were to be selected
in accordance with the principles of adjustment defined
in the Act of 1826. These provisions were incorporated
in §§ 2275 and 2276 of the Revised Statutes. And the
latter were amended by the Act of February 28, 1891,
c. 384 (26 Stat. 796), which in part provided: "And other
lands of equal acreage are also hereby appropriated and
granted, and may be selected by said State or Territory,
where section sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or
are included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United States."
In this manner, Congress has undertaken to discharge
its obligation by assuring to the States the equivalent
of the school grant sections when these have 'been sold
or otherwise been disposed of.'
The question now presented was not involved in Ham v.
Missouri, 18 How. 126, or in Cooper v. Roberts, 18 How.
173. The former case related to the school grant to Missouri under the Act of March 6, 1820 (c. 22, 3 Stat. 545,
547). Ham had been indicted for waste and trespass on
the sixteenth section of one of the townships, and his
conviction was affirmed. In defense, he claimed title
under a Spanish grant. This had been rejected by the
Board of Commissioners in 1811, and it appeared that
the United States had full power of disposition at the
time of the donation to the State. Referring to the provision for the grant of equivalent lands, to take the place
of those "sold or otherwise-disposed of," the court said:
"Sale, necessarily signifying a legal sale by a competent
authority, is a disposition, final and irrevocable, of the
land. The phrase 'or otherwise disposed of' must signify
some disposition of the property equally efficient, and
equally incompatible with any right in the State, present
or potential, as deducible from the Act of 1820, and the
ordinance of the same year." But in the case cited there

ITNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

had been no such disposition. Reliance was placed by
Ham upon an act of May 24, 1828 (6 Stat. 386) confirming the grant to his predecessors, but this confirmatory act explicitly provided that it should not "prejudice
the rights of third persons, nor any title heretofore derived from the United States, either by purchase or donation." And it further appeared that the survey had been
made of the land in question before the confirmatory
act was passed (see 18 How., p. 134). In Cooper v. Roberts,
supra, the plaintiff asserted title under the school grant
made to Michigan (Act of June 23, 1836, c. 121, 5 Stat.
59). The section sixteen in controversy had been surveyed in 1847. Sale had been made by the State in February, 1851, and its patent had issued in November of that
year. It was in 1850, after the lands had been surveyed,
that the defendant's grantor had applied to the officers
of the land office to enter the land, and the entry was allowed in 1852 with a reservation of the rights of Michigan,
which the Secretary of the Interior deemed to be superior.
It was in these circumstances, it being found that there was
no legal impediment through any legislation, that the
court held that the title had passed to the State.
In the case of Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold &c. Co., 93
U. S. 634, there had been a disposition of the land under
the authority of Congress between the date of the school
grant and the date of the survey. This case arose under
the school grant to Nevada (Act of March 21, 1864, c. 36,
13 Stat. 30, 32), which was one of the exceptional instances
where words of present grant were used, these however
being qualified by the clause relating to sale or other
disposition. The act provided: "That sections numbers
sixteen and thirty-six, in every township, and where such
sections have been sold or otherwise disposed of by any act
of Congress, other lands equivalent thereto

issued by the State of Nevada in 1868. The land was
mineral land, and the. defendant was in possession, carrying on the mining business, having obtained a patent from
the Uhited States under the acts of July 26, 1866 (c. 262,
14 Stat. 251), as amended, and May 10, 1872 (c. 152, 17
Stat. 91). The entry and claim of the defendant's predecessors in interest were made in 1867 prior to the survey
of the section'in question. It was held that the lands
were subject to the disposition of Congress until the
survey and its approval;, and hence the judgnent in
favor of the defendant was affirmed. The words of present
grant were deemed to be restricted by-the words of qualification. The court said that it was intended to place
Nevada "on an equal footing with States then recently
admitted. Her people were not interested in getting the
identical sections 16 and 36 in every township. Indeed,
it could not be known until after a survey where they
would fall,-and a grant of quantity put her in as good a
condition as the other States which had received the
benefit of this bounty. A grant, operating at once, and
attaching prior to the surveys by the United States,
would deprive Congress of the power of disposing of any
part of the lands in Nevada, until they were segregated
from those granted. In the meanfime, further improvements would be arrested, and the persons,,who prior to
the surveys had occupied and improved the country,
would lose their possessions and labor, in-case it turMed out
that they had settled upon the specified sections .
Until the status of the lands was fixed by a survey, and
they were capable of identification, Congress reserved absolute power over them; and if in exercising it the whole
or any part of a 16th or 36th section had been disposed of,
the State was to be compensated by other lands equal in.
quantity, and as near as may be in quality. By this
means the State was fully indemnified, the settlers ran
no risk of losing the labor of years, and Congress was left

Opinion of the Court.

free to legislate touching the national domain in any way
it saw- fit, to promote the public interests."
It is said that the Nevada school grant added the words
"by any act of Congress" to the phrase "otherwise
disposed of," 'and that the former words are not in the
Oregon grant. But this does notmark a-distinction, as
"otherwise disposed of," of course, implies that the disposition shall be by competent authority. It is also urged
that the court emphasized the fact that there had been
no sale or disposition of the public lands in Nevada prior
to the Enabling Act and therefore that the clause, could
refer only to future disposition; .whereas, in the case of
Oregon, there had been earlier provisions for the disposal
of the public domain. But Congress used the same phrase
substantially in nearly every one of the school grants,
and it was the manifest intentioh to place the States on
the same footing in this matter. The same clause, relating to the same subject, and enacted in pursuance of the
same policy, did not have one meaning in one grant and
a different meaning in another; it covered other dispositions, whether prior or subsequent, if made before the
land had been appropriately identified by survey and
title had passed. Nor is a distinction to be observed between mineral lands and other lands, if in fact Congress
disposed of them. The validity of the disposition would
not be affected by the character of the lands, although
this might supply the motive for the action of Congress.
We regard the decision in the Heydenfeldt Case as establishing a definite rule of construction.
In opposition to this definition of the effect of the
donation for school purposes, the appellees rely upon
what was said in Beecher v. Wetherby, 95 U. S. 517. That
was an action of replevin to recover logs cut on a section
sixteen in Wisconsin which had been granted by the
Enabling Act of Aug. 6,1846 (c. 89, 9 Stat. 56, 58). The
exterior lines of the township in which the land was

situated were run in October, 1852, and the section lines
in May and June, 1854; and the defendant claimed under
patents from the State issued in 1865 and 1870. The
land had been occupied by the Menominee Indians, but
their right was only that of occupancy. "The fee was in
the United States, subject to that right, and could be
transferred by them whenever they chose." By the
treaty of 1848 (9 Stat. 952) these Indians agreed to cede
to the United States all their lands in Wisconsin, it being
stipulated that they should be entitled to remain on the
lands for two years. In view of their unwillingness to
withdraw, a further act was passed (10 Stat. 1064) by
which a tract was assigned to them embracing the land
in controversy. Subsequently, a portion of this reservation was assigned by another treaty to the Stockbridge
and Munsee tribes, and for the benefit of the latter Congress passed the Act of February 6, 1871 (16 Stat. 404,
c. 38) providing for the sale of certain townships. The
plaintiff asserted title under patents issued by the United
States in 1872 pursuant to this act. It appeared, however, that the Indian occupation of the land had ceased
before the logs were cut. The court held that the title
had vested in the State and hence that the plaintiff had
acquired no title by his patents from the United States.
It was said in the opinion that by the compact with the
State (the school grant) the lands were "withdrawn from
any other disposition, and set apart from the public
domain, so that no subsequent law authorizing a sale of
it could be construed to embrace them, although they were
not specially excepted"; and that after this compact "no
subsequent sale or other disposition

.

.

could defeat

the appropriation." But it was also stated that "when
the logs in suit were cut, those tribes (Stockbridge and
Munsee) had removed from the land in controversy, and
other sections-had been set apart for their occupation."
That is, the lands had been surveyed in 1854; prior to

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that time, there had been no other disposition of the fee
by the-United States; the title had vested in the State
subject at most to the Indian occupancy, and this had
terminated. There was abundant reason for the decision
that these lands were not embraced, and were not intended
to be embraced, in the provisions for sale made by the
Act of 1871. What was said in the opinion must be
considered in the light of the facts (Weyerhaeuser v.
Hoyt, 219 U. S. 380, 394). The Heydenfeldt Case was not
cited and cannot be regarded as overruled. See New York
Indians v. United States, 170 U. S. 1, 18; Minnesota v.
Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 375, 399-401.
The rule which, the Heydenfeldt Case established has,
we understand, been uniformly followed in the land office.
After reviewing the cases, Secretary Lamar concluded
(December 6, 1887; to Stockslager, Commissioner,6 L. D.
412, 417) that the school grant "does not take effect
until after survey, and if at that date the specific sections
are in a condition to pass by the grant, the absolute fee
to said sections immediately vests in the State, and if
at that date said sections have been sold or disposed of,
the State takes indemnity therefor." And see, to the
same effect, Niven v. California,6 L. D. 439; Washington
v. Kuhn, 24 L. D. 12, 13; California v. Wright, Id. 54,
57; South Dakota v. Riley, 34 L. D. 657, 660; South Dakota
v. Thomas, 35 L. D. 171, 173.; F. A. Hyde, 37 L. D. 164,
166; to Atty. Gen. of Montana, 38 L. D. 247, 250.
The case of United States v. Thomas, 151 U. S. 577,
involved the Wisconsin school grant, the question being
whether the Federal court in that State had jurisdiction
to try an Indian charged with the murder of another
Indian within the limits of section sixteen in a township
forming part of an Indian reservation. It appeared that
by treaty prior to the Enabling Act of 1846 the Indians
had stipulated for the right of occupancy; that they had
never been removed from the lands; and that, by treaty

of 1854, the particular reservation in question had been
established. The lands were not surveyed until 1855.
From any point of view it was clear that the title had
never vested in the State, except as subordinate to the
right of occupation of the Indians, and it was held that
the Federal jurisdiction existed. Minnesota v. Hitchcock,
supra, was a suit brought by the State to enjoin the
Secretary of the Interior from selling any sections sixteen
and thirty-six in the Red Lake Indian Reservation, the
sales having been authorized by the Act of January 14,
1889 (c. 24, 25 Stat. 642) which was passed for the relief
of the Chippewa Indians. The school grant to Minnesota
was made by the Enabling Act of Feb. 26th, 1857 (c. 60,
11 Stat. 166, 167). The lands in question, however,
were not surveyed until after the Act of 1889 had been
passed and the agreement it contemplated had been
made with the Indians. The court dismissed the bill
of the State. It was held that when Congress undertook
in 1889 "to make provision for this body of lands it could
have by treaty taken simply a cession of the Indian rights
of occupancy, and thereupon the lands would have become public lands and within the scope of the school
grant"; but that Congress also "had the power to make
arrangements with the Indians by which the entire tract
would be otherwise appropriated. . . . Before any
survey of the lands, before the state right had attached
to any particular sections, the United States made a
treaty or agreement with the Indians, by which they
accepted a cession of the entire tract under a trust for
its disposition in a particular way." The Heydenfeldt
Case was cited with approval. Referring to the joint
resolution passed by Congress on March 3, 1857 (c. 12,
11 Stat. 254) to the effect that in case of settlements on
the sixteenth or thirty-sixth sections, their selection as
town sites, or their reservation for public uses prior to
survey, other lands should be selected in lieu thereof,

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and to the contention of the State that the 'public uses'
thus contemplated were 'governmental uses,' the court
said: "It is unnecessary to rest upon a determination
of this question. We refer to the resolution as an express
declaration by Congress that the school sections were not
granted to the State absolutely, and beyond any further
control by Congress, or any further action under the
general land laws. As in Heydenfeldt v. Daney Gold &c.
Co., supra, priority was given to a mining entry over
the State's school right, so here, in terms, preference is
given to private entries, town-si te entries, or reservations
for public uses. In other words, the act of admission
with its clause in respect to school lands, was not a promise
by Congress that under all circumstances, either then or
in the future, these specific school sections were or should
become the property of the State. The possibility of
other disposition was contemplated, the right of Congress
to make it was recognized, and provision made for a
selection of other lands in lieu thereof. In this connection may also be noticed the Act of February 28, 1891,
although passed after the approval of the agreement for
the cession of these lands by the Indians. That act in
terms authorized the selection of other lands 'where
sections sixteen or thirty-six are mineral land, or are
included within any Indian, military, or other reservation, or are otherwise disposed of by the United
States.
The case of Wisconsin v. Hitchcock, 201 U. S. 202,
followed United States v. Thomas, supra, and Minnesota
v. Hitchcock, supra. In Alabama v. Schmidt, 232 U. S.
168, there was no question as to the acquisition of title
by the State. It was held that, assuming that the State
had acquired title to the lands embraced in the school
grant, it had authority to subject the lands in its hands
to the ordinary incidents of other titles in the State, including that of adverse possession.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Cotirt.

240 U. S.

We conclude that the State of Oregon did not take
title to the land prior to the survey; and that until the
sections were defined by survey and title had vested
in the State, Congress was at liberty to dispose of
the land, its obligation in that event being properly
to compensate the State for whatever deficiencies resulted.
The remaining question, then, is whether there had
been a survey prior to an authorized withdrawal for
forestry purposes. The surveying of the public lands
is an administrative act confided to the control of the
Commissioner of the General Land Office under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. Act of July 4, 1836
(c. 352, 5 Stat. 107); Rev. Stat., § 453. It was competent
for the Commissioner, acting within this authority, to
direct how surveys should be made and to require that
they should be subject to his examination and approval
before they were filed as officially complete in the local
land office. Cragin v. Powell, 128 U. S. 691, 697, 698;
Tubbs v. Wilhoit, 138 U. S. 134, 143, 144; Knight v. U S.
Land Association, 142 U. S. 161, 177, 182; Michigan Land
Co. v. Rust, 168 U. S. 589, 594. This was a continuing
authority which was not suspended by the school grant
to the State. The subsequent adoption of rules relating
to surveys did not alter the terms of the grant, but these
rules did control the administrative action which in view
of the terms of the grant was necessary to make the
grant effective. By order of April 17, 1879, the Commissioner required that surveyors-general should not "file
the duplicate plats in the local land offices until the
duplicates have been examined in this office and approved" and the surveyors-general "officially notified to
that effect." 37 L. D. 165. It cannot be doubted that
this requirement was within the authority of the Commissioner (see Tubbs v. Wilhoit, supra); and it necessarily
follows that the making of the field 'survey and its ap-

proval by the surveyor-general of Oregon did not make
the survey complete as an official act. It still remained
subject to the examination and approval of the Commissioner, and for that purpose copies of the plat of survey
and field notes were transmitted to the Commissioner
who, not being satisfied, required a- supplemental report.
The matter was still in abeyance when the lands in controversy were withdrawn for forestry purposes by the
Secretary of the Interior on December 16, 1905. Reference is made to the terms of the Territorial Act of
1848 (supra) with respect to the reservation of the described sections when the lands were "surveyed
preparatory to bringing the same into market," but this
provision furnishes no ground for the contention that an
incomplete and unapproved survey was intended. Much
less can it be said that under the grant of the Enabling
Act of 1859 the title would pass at any intermediate
stage of the survey. Nor is there merit in the contention
that is based on § 2275 of the Revised Statutes as amended
by the Act of February 28, 1891. (supra), protecting
settlements when made "before the survey of the lands
in the field." That act imposes no limitation upon the
authority of Congress to dispose of the lands before title
passes to the State; and if title passes upon survey, it
must be upon a survey duly completed according to the
authorized regulations of the Department. It is said,
however, that in this case the plat was officially used by
the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the
Secretary of the Interior in connection with the withdrawal under consideraV.'on, and hence that the survey
must be deemed to have been officially approved. Wright
v. Roseberry, 121 U. S. 488, 517; Tubbs v. Wilhoit, supra.
It is true that the lands withdrawn were conveniently
described according to townships and that the official
correspondence referred to an accompanying diagram
showing the townships and sections. But neither the

240 U. S.

correspondence nor the diagram contained any reference
to a survey of the lands in question or constituted an
approval of a survey. These lands still remained to be
officially defined in the appropriate manner and according
to the agreed statement the survey was accepted by the
Commissioner of the General Land Office, as stated, on
January 31, 1906, and was filed in the local land office on
November 16, 1907, entries during the interval having
been suspended pending certain investigations. We think
that it is immaterial that the survey was finally approved
by the Commissioner without modification, for pending
the approval it remained in his hands, officially incomplete, awaiting the result of his examination. Again, it is
urged that the survey when approved related back to the
date of the grant or at least to the date of the survey in
the field. The former contention is but a restatement in
another form of the argument that Congress could not
dispose of the land pending the survey which as we have
seen is answered by the terms of the grant; and if Congress had this power of disposition, it must mean that the
lands could be disposed of under the authority of Congress
at any time before the survey became a 'completed administrative act. The doctrine of relation cannot be
invoked to destroy this authority.
In establishing and enlarging the Cascade Range Forest
Reserve, the President acted under the express authority
conferred by the Acts of March 3, 1891, c. 561, § 24 (26
Stat. 1095, 1.103), and June 4, 1897, c. 2 (30 Stat. 11, 36).
The power to establish the permanent reservation included the power to make temporary withdrawals (United
States v. Midwest Oil Co., 236 U. S. 459, 476); and the
order of the Secretary of the Interior made on December 16, 1905, must be regarded as the act of the President.
Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498. The disposition by the
President, under the authority of Congress, was a disposition by Congress.

UNITED STATES v. MORRISON.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

It is finally contended that the Proclamation by the
President on January 25, 1907, expressly. excepted the
lands in question. The exception was "of all lands which
at this date are embraced within any withdrawal or
reservation for any use or purpose to which this reservation for forest uses is inconsistent." The evident purpose
of the Proclamation was to confirm and make permanent
the prior withdrawal for forestry purposes, not to override
it. The very object of that withdrawal was to prevent
claims of title from thereafter attaching to the lands.
And the reference in the exception to 'any withdrawal or
reservation,' as we view it, was to withdrawals or reservations by the Government itself for other and inconsistent
uses and was with a view of avoiding confusion in governmental action, not to let in subsequently accruing claims
of title under school grants as to which Congress had
indicated its purpose to make compensation for deficiencies when lands which otherwise would have passed
to the State thereunder had been duly taken for reservations. The contention that the lands were not 'public
lands' until surveyed and hence were not subject to
-reservation by the President under the act of Congress is
plainly without basis. See Rev. Stat., § 453. The provision for forest reservations refers to any part of the public
lands which were subject to the disposition of Congress.
It is also argued that the State under the Act of February 28, 1891 (supra), has the right to await the 'extinguishment' of the 'reservation'- and the 'restoration
of the lands therein embraced to the public domain,' and
then to take the described sections. We are not called
upon to consider any ,such question here, and we express
no opinion upon it, as there has been no extinguishment
of the reservation, and from any point of view it must
be concluded that no title had passed to the State when
it made the conveyance under which the appellees
claim.

ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FOURTH CIRCUIT.
No. 176. Argued January 14, 1916.-Decided February 21, 1916.
Final settlement of a contractor's account within the meaning of the
Act of August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, as amended February 24,
1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811, is not when the final payment is made, but
is the final administrative determination by the proper authority of
the amount due; in this case, held that a suit by a sub-contractor
against the surety commenced six months after date of such determination, but less than six months after payment was not prematurely brought, no action having been brought meanwhile by the
United States.
Where the action on the contractor's bond was brought within
the proper time, an amendment made after the expiration of such
time, which does not set up a new or different cause of action but
merely corrects a defective statement, may be allowed. Texas
Cement Co. v. McCord, 233 U. S. 157.
The contested liability of a surety on a contractor's bond is not to be
determined in equity; the action under the act of 1894 as amended
in 1905 is one at law.
If the surety does not contest, but pays into court the full amount of
liability, discharging all liability as provided by the statute, the
proceeding is simply one for distribution of a fund in court.
