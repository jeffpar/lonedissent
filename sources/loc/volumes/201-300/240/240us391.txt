Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

ante, p. 342, and Tanner v. Little, ante, p. 369. What

BADDERS v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS.
No. 521.

Argued February 23, 24, 1916.-Decided March 6, 1916.

Congress has power to regulate the overt act of putting a letter into
the post Office of the United States; and may prohibit, under penalty, such an act when done in' furtherance of a .scheme which it
regards as contrary to public policy, whether it can forbid the
scheme or not, and so held as to.Criminal Code, § 215.
Intent may make criminal an act, otherwise innocent, if it is a step
in a plot.,
Congress may enact that each putting of a letter in a post office is a
separate offense.
The punishment imposed in this ease on each of five counts, of five
years, the periods being concurrent and not cumulative, and a fine of
$1,000 on each of seven counts, held not to be cruel and unusual
within the prohibition of the Federal Constitution.
This court condemns the extravagant and unnecessary multiplication
of. exceptions and assignments of error.

THE facts, which involve the construction and constitutionality of § 215, Criminal Code, and the validity of a

conviction and sentence thereunder, are 'stated in the
opinion.

Section 215 of the Criminal Code as applied to the in-

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

240 U. S:

dictment, trial and conviction of the defendant, is unconstitutional and void.
As interpreted by the trial court, § 215 encounters
that provision of the Constitution which provides "that
excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted."
Where the accused is held under a Federal indictment
which. does not substantially state an offence against the
laws of the United States, he is deprived of his constitutional right to be informed of the charge against him.
The statement of facts in that part of the indictment
attempting to charge a scheme or artifice is insufficient.
The indictment is fatally defective in that it does not
state facts showing that the defendant devised any scheme
or artifice; also because it does not charge an intent on
the part of the defendant to use the post office establishment as a means to effect the alleged scheme or artifice.
The indictment is duplicitous in that it cannot be determined whether it charges the defendant with having
devised a scheme or artifice to defraud, or a scheme or
artifice for obtaining property by means of false or fraudulent pretences, representations or promises.
Plaintiff in error is held to answer for an infamous crime
without an indictment of a grand jury found and presented as required by law.
Having directed an officer of the court to produce material documentary evidence in his possession, necessary
for the defence, the court erred in refusing defendant
time and- opportunity to supply secondary evidence of
the contents of such documents when the officer failed
to produce. them, claiming that they had disappeared.
The defendant was not arraigned as required by law.
The court's refusal to give the instructions requested by
the defendant constitutes material and prejudicial error.
. The evidence is insufficient to sustain verdicts of guilty
as to any of the counts of the indictment.

BADDERS v. UNITED STATES.
240 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Numerous authorities, both state and Federal, support
these contentions.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Wallace for the United
States.
MR.

JUSTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion of the court.

This case is brought to this court from the District
Court under § 238 of the Judicial Code, Act of March 3,'
1911, c. 231; 36 Stat. 1087, 1157, on the ground that it
involves the construction and application of the Constitution of the United States, The plaintiff in error was
indicted for placing letters in the mail for the purpose of
executing a scheme to defraud devised by him, in violation
of § 215 of the Criminal Code, Act of March 4, 1909, c. 321;
35 Stat. 1088, 1130. There were twelve counts, on seven
of which, each relating to a different letter, he was found
guilty. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment
on each count, the periods being concurrent not cumulative, and also to a fine of $1,000 on each, or $7,000 in all.
The grounds for coming to this' court are first that § 215
of the Criminal Code is beyond the power of Congress as
applied to what may be a mere incident of a fraudulent
scheme that itself is outside the jurisdiction of Congress
to deal with; and second that if it makes the deposit of
each letter a separate offence subject to such punishment
as it received in this case it imposes cruel and unusual
punishment and excessive fines.
These contentions need no extended answer. The overt
act of putting a letter into the postoffice of the United
States is a matter that Congress may regulate. Ex parte
Jackson, 96 U. S. 727. Whatever the limits to its power,
it may forbid any such acts done. in 'furtherance of a
scheme that it regards as contrary to public policy,
whether it can forbid the scheme or not. In re Rapier,

143 U. S. 110, 134. Public Clearing House v. Coyne, 194
U. S. 497, 507. United States v. Stever, 222 U. S. 167, 173
See Lottery Case (Champion v. Ames), 188 U. S. 321, 357.
United States v. Holte, 236 U. S. 140, 144. Intent may
make an otherwise innocent act criminal, if it is a step in
a plot. Aikens v. Wisconsin, 195 U. S. 194, 206. Swift &
Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375, 396. The acts alleged
have been found to have been done for the purpose of
executing the scheme, and there would be no ground for
contending, if it were argued, that they were too remotely
connected with the scheme for the law to deal with them.
The whole matter is disposed of by United States v. Young,
232 U. S. 155, 161. Asto the other point, there is no doubt
that the law may make each putting of a letter into the
postoffice a separate offence. Ebeling v. Morgan, 237
U. S. 625. In re Henry, 123 U. S. 372, 374. And there is
no ground for declaring the punishment unconstitutional.
Howard v. Fleming, 191 U. S. 126, 135. Ebeling v. Morgan,
supra.
The other matters discussed are before us only as incident to the constitutional questions upon which the case
was brought here. As those questions merely attempt to
reopen well established and familiar law it is not necessary
to go beyond them. Brolan v. United States, 222 U. S. 215,
216, 222. There is the more reason for declining further
consideration in the extravagant and unnecessary multiplication of exceptions and assignments of error that
often has been condemned by this court. Central Vermont
Ry. v. White, 238 U. S. 507, 509. If there were anything
in the objections to the indictment they are not of a kind
to involve constitutional rights, Lamar v. United States,
240 U. S. 60, although the argument attempts to give a
constitutional turn to them and to other technical complaints, such as that the judge was absent during a part of
the deliberations of the grand jury. We find no error in
this or the other particulars mentioned in argument.

ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY v.
MESSINA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
MISSISSIPPI.
No. 535.

Argued February 23, 1916.--Decided March 6, 1916.

While the Anti-pass Provision of the Hepburn Act of 1906 may have
had more formal uses especially in view than that of allowing a
person to ride upon an interstate train by permission of an employ6

of the carrier, this court carmot limit the prohibition to such uses.
There being a question whether plaintiff, who was injured while riding

free by consent of the engineer on the engine of an interstate train,
could have recovered under state law had his presence been illegal
under the Federal statute, held that it was reversible error not to

have charged the jury that the Federal act applied.

THE facts, which involve the construction and application of the Anti-pass provision of the Hepburn Act of
1906, are stated in the opinion.

and Mr. Blewett Lee were on the brief, for plaintiffs in
