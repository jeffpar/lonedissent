CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 68.

Submitted November 10, 1919.-Decided March 1, 1920.

In purchasing necessary supplies, the master of a demised vessel, appointed by the owner but under the orders of the charterer, is the
charterer's agent. P. 523.
A charter-party, demising a vessel, required the charterer to pay all
expenses and save the owner harmless from liens, allowed the owner
to retake the vessel should the charterer fail to discharge any liens
within a stated period after they were imposed, and placed the master, appointed by the owner, under the charterer's orders. Applying
the Act of June 23, 1910, held that the charter-party, if it did not
grant, at least assumed authority in the charterer to bind the vessel
for necessary supplies purchased by the master in a domestic port,
and that the statutory presumption of such authority could not be
dispelled by denials and warnings from the owner to the supply man.

The statute specifically provides that there shall be no
lien if the furnisher knew or could have ascertained by the
exercise of reasonable diligence that, for any reason, the
person ordering the supplies had no authority to bind the
vessel therefor. The furnisher in the instant case had
been warned that the owner and the charterer had
agreed, either by the terms of the written charter-party or
by some other contract, that the vessel should not be held.
Before he furnished the goods he had been informed of this
fact by the owner, the charterer and the charterer's
agent. Notwithstanding the words "or for any other

delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is a'libel against the Steamer South Coast, belonging to the claimant, a California corporation, and registered in San Francisco, for necessary supplies furnished in
San Pedro, California. The answer denies the authority
of the master to bind the steamer. The bare vessel at the
time was under charter to one Levick, the contract stipulating that Levick was to pay all charges and to save the
owner harmless from all liens or expenses that it might be
put to in consequence of such liens. There was also a
provision that the owner might retake the vessel in case of
failure of Levick to discharge within thirty days any
debts which were liens upon it, and another for surrender
of the vessel free of all liens upon Levick's failure to make
certain payments. When the supplies were ordered
representatives of the owner in San Pedro warned the
libellant that the steamer was under charter and that he
must not furnish the supplies on the credit of the vessel.
He replied that he would not furnish them in any other
way, but the reply does not affect the case because by the
terms of the charter the master who ordered them, although appointed by the owner, was under the orders of
Leviek. It is agreed by both courts below that if the
owner had power to prevent the attaching of a lien by its
warning it had done so. Both courts however held that the
charter gave the master power to create the lien. 233

Dissent.

By the Act of June 23, 1910, c. 373, ยง 1, 36 Stat. 604, a
maritime lien is given for such supplies and by ยง 3 a presumption is declared that a master appointed by a charterer has authorit from the owner to procure them. It is
true that the act goes on that uothing in it shall be considered to give a lien where the furnisher knew, or by the
exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained,
that because of the terms of a charter-party, or for any
other reason, the person ordering the necessaries was
without authority to bind the vessel. But the authority of
the owner to prohibit or to speak was displaced, so far as
the charter went, by that conferred upon the charterers,
who became owners pro hac vice, and therefore, unless the
charter excluded the master's power, the owner could not
forbid its use. The charter-party recognizes that liens
may be imposed by the charterers and allowed to stand
for less than a month and there seems to be no sufficient
reason for supposing the words not to refer to all the
*ordinary maritime liens recognized by the law. The
statute had given a lien for supplies in a domestic port and
therefore had made that one of these ordinary liens.
Therefore the 'charterer was assumed to have power to'
authorize the master to impose a lien in a domestic port,
and if the assumption expressed in words was not equivalent to a grant of power, at least it cannot be taken to have
excluded it. There was nothing from which the furnisher
could have ascertained that the master did not have
power to bind the ship.
Decree affirmed.
