WAREHOUSE COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.

DRYFOOS ET AL. v. EDWARDS, COLLECTOR OF
INTERNAL REVENUE FOR THE SECOND COLECTION DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

Nos. 589, 602.

Argued November 20, 1919.-Decided December 15,
1919.

The power to prohibit the liquor traffic as a means of increasing war
efficiency is part of the war power of Congress, and its exercise without providing for compensation is no more limited by the Fifth
Amendment than a like exercise of a State's police power would be
limited by the Fourteenth Amendment. P. 154.
The War-Time Prohibition Act, approved ten days after the armistice
with Germany was signed, Act of November 21, 1918, c. 212, 40
Stat. 1046, provided: "That after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred
and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which
shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United
States, for the purpose of conserving the man power of the Nation,
and to increase efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, ships,
food, and clothing for the Army and Navy, it shall be unlawful to
sell for beverage purposes any distilled spirits, and during said
time no distilled spirits held in bond shall be removed therefrom for
beverage purposes except for export." Held, in respect of liquors in
bond, even if belonging to one who made and owned them before the

act was passed and paid revenue taxes upon them since June 30,
1919:
(1) That the act was not an appropriation of such liquors for public
purposes. P. 157.
(2) That the time allowed for disposing of all liquors in bond on November 21, 1918, could not be declared unreasonable, as a matter
of law, even if they were not sufficiently ripened or aged to be disposed of advantageously during the period limited. P. 158.
(3) That the prohibition was not in violation of the Fifth Amendment
as a taking of property without compensation. P. 157.
(4) That it was within the war power when passed (notwithstanding
the cessation of hostilities under the armistice), as a means of war
efficiency and for the support and care of the Army and Navy during demobilization. P. 158.
A wide latitude of discretion must be accorded to Congress in the exercise of the war powers. P. 163.
The court cannot inquire into the motives of Congress, in determining
the validity of its acts, or into the wisdom of the legislation; nor pass
upon the necessity for the exercise of a power possessed. P. 161.
It is settled that the war power carries with it the power to guard
against immediate renewal of the conflict and to remedy the evils
which have arisen from its rise and progress. Id.
Assuming that the continuing validity of an act passed under the war
power may depend not upon the existence of a technical state of
war, terminable only with the ratification of a treaty of peace or
by a proclamation of peace, but upon some actual war emergency
or necessity, the court cannot say that the necessity for the prohibition had ceased when these suits were begun, in view of the facts
that the treaty of peace has not been concluded, that various war
activities,-among them national control of railroads,--continue,
and that the man power of the nation has not been completely restored to a peace footing. P. 161.
The Eighteenth Amendment did not operate to repeal the War-Time
Prohibition Act. P. 163.
In defining the period of the prohibition, Congress in the War-Time
Prohibition Act, doubtless expecting that the war would be definitely
ended by a peace under a ratified treaty or a proclamation before
demobilization was complete, intended that the prohibition should
continue until the date of the termination of demobilization had
been definitely ascertained by the President and made known by
him through a proclamation to that end. P. 164.

President's message communicating his veto of the National Prohibition Act, is not the proclamation required by the War-Time
Prohibition Act. P. 167.
In an exact sense, demobilization had not terminated then or when
these suits were begun, as is shown by the report on the subject of
the Secretary of War, made to the President and transmitted to Congress; nor does it appear that it has yet so terminated. P. 168.

Mr. Levy Mayer and Mr. William Marshall Bullitt for
appellee in No. 589:
Congress has no power to prohibit the sale of whisky
within a State, except under its war powers. By the
Tenth Amendment the States reserved to themselves the
police power over the liquor traffic with the right to abolish
future manufacture, sale or possession. This power is
absolute and exclusive, since, as before, the Fourteenth
Amendment. But it is still an open question whether
a State can make unlawful the possession, use or sale
of liquors lawfully acquired (as in the present case) before
the passage of the prohibitory statute. Bartemeyer v.
Iowa, 18 Wall. 129; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U. S.
25; Eberle v. Michigan, 232 U. S. 700, 706; Barbour v.
Georgia, 249 U. S. 454, 459; Wynehamer v. People, 13
N. Y. 378.
Congress can waive the interstate character of liquor in
order to subject it to the laws of a State when once introduced therein, or can prohibit its transportation to a
State where its possession is prohibited. In re Rahrer, 140
U. S. 545; Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry.
Co., 242 U. S. 311, 323. But Congress has no power, in
peace time, to prohibit the sale of whisky. In re Rahrer,

Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 273-276; Keller v. United
States, 213 U. S. 138, 144, 148.
In order to guard and promote the health, welfare and
efficiency of the men composing the army and navy, and
to increase the efficiency of the workers in the production
of arms, munitions, 'hips, food and clothing for them,
Congress has the right temporarily to regulate the sale of
liquor, and, if reasonably necessary to accomplish such
objects, to forbid its sale. McKinley v. United States,
249 U. S. 397, 399; Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S.
366; Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, 52; Grancourt
v. United States, 258 Fed. Rep. 25; United States v. Casey,
247 Fed. Rep. 362; Pappens v. United States, 252 Fed.
Rep. 55. But the exercise of this power, like all others, is
subject to the Fifth Amendment. Ex parte Milligan, 4
Wall. 2; Johnson v. Jones, 44 Illinois, 142; Monongahela
Nay. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 336; McCray v.
United States, 195 U. S. 27, 61. It necessarily follows that
if, in the exercise of the war power, private property is
taken, the owner thereof is entitled to just compensation
therefor.
Whisky is property and when taken for public use is
entitled to the protection of the Fifth Amendment.
Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100, 110; Wynehamer v. People,
13 N. Y. 378, 383, 384; Commonwealth v. Campbell, 133
Kentucky, 50; Barber v. Commonwealth, 182 Kentucky,
200; Commonwealth v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse
Co., 143 Kentucky, 314.
The War-Time Prohibition Act takes appellee's private
property for public use, but makes no provision for just
compensation to the owner. Therefore, the act is unconstitutional. The act prohibits appellee from either selling
the whisky which it has in its own possession fully tax
paid, or obtaining possession of its property which is in

the Government's bonded warehouses. The effect is that
the appellee has been deprived of every attribute of
ownership, except the necessity of paying taxes to the
United States upon the very property which the Government refuses to allow the owner to use or sell. If this does
not constitute a taking of a person's property, the English
language has lost its meaning. Buchanan v. Warley, 245
U. S. 60, 74, 81; Wynehamer v. People, 13 N. Y. 387, 389,
396, 398; Foster v. Scott, 136 N. Y. 577; United States v.
Cress, 243 U. S. 316; United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S.
445. The appellee was required by the federal statute to
provide, at its own expense, bonded warehouses, which
were under the exclusive control of the Government.
Taney v. Penn National Bank, 232 U. S. 174; Dale v.
Pattison,234 U. S. 399. By statute, it was also authorized
to leave its whisky in bond for eight years, and to bottle it
in bond at any time after the first four years. The whisky
in question was rightfully in appellee's bonded warehouses and it had the right to rely upon the "bottling in
bond statute," and furthermore it could not have bottled a
large part of the whisky because it had not been in the
warehouses four years at the time the War Prohibition
Act was enacted. It is therefore no answer to suggest
that the appellee should have withdrawn the whisky from
bond and sold the same before the War Prohibition Act
was enacted. As the taking is solely under the war power,
it is concededly for a public use. No provision for any
compensation was made; but, on the contrary, Congress
(February 24, 1919) imposed a heavy retroactive tax
(double the then existing tax) on all whisky, including that
already tax-paid; the tax was assessed and collected; and
the owners are now prohibited from selling the very
whisky on which they have paid that tax, a large part of
which the appellee was compelled to pay as late as September 24, 1919. It is a false analogy to say that under the
war power Congress is endowed with what are commonly

HAMILTON v. KENTUCKY DISTILLERIES CO.
146.

151

Argument for Appellee in No. 589.

called the police powers of the States and consequently
may exercise them as unlimitedly as do the States. For
the police powers of the States are not subject to the
Fifth Amendment, whereas the war powers of Congress
are. It has not been decided that even the state police
powers may prohibit sale of liquor made before the passage
of the law. While it is true that Congress' exercise of the
war power can accomplish anything which the States can
accomplish under their police power, yet the qualifications
imposed thereon are different. It may not, for instance,
require excessive bail, refuse a public trial in a criminal
case, or cause the accused to be a witness against himself.
The instances might be multiplied where States are free
in the exercise of their police powers, from requirements to
which Congress, even in the exercise of its war power, is
subject. The law is abundantly settled that while the
Fifth Amendment does not require that the just compensation shall be actually paid in advance of the taking,
nevertheless, the owner is entitled to some reasonable,
certain and adequate provision for obtaining such compensation before his ownership or possession can be
interfered with.
The War-Time Prohibition Act has, by its own terms,
ceased to be operative. The evil sought to be remedied
was the danger of intoxication of soldiers, sailors and war
workers during the war and during the subsequent period
of demobilization. Cong. Rec., vol. 56, pp. 9627, 9641.
Demobilization is the act of disbanding troops; the reduction of military armaments to a peace footing. Century
Dictionary; 18 Corpus Juris, 484; Cong. Rec., loc. cit.
The President's acts and declarations amount to a
proclamation of "the date of the conclusion of the present
war," in the sense of actual hostilities, and -thereafterthe
"termination of demobilization." [Counsel quoted also
statements made by the War Department and by General
Pershing, to the effect that demobilization was at an end.]

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Appellee in No. 589.

251 U. S.

The demobilization process has continued steadily until
the strength of both the army and navy has been reduced
to less than the authorized peace quota. The production
of war munitions has stopped, all existing contracts have
been canceled and the Government is actively disposing
of its surplus war supplies of arms, munitions, food and
clothing, etc.
What is meant by "conclusion of the present war" must
be determined by the purpose of this particular act, and
the evident belief of Congress that the ending of the war
would precede demobilization. Cases like Hijo v. United
States, 194 U. S. 315, holding war existent until ratification of peace, are inapplicable. That Congress purposely
did not intend to make the "conclusion of the present
war" dependent upon any treaty of peace is illustrated by
a comparison of the language of this act with that of other
war legislation wherein the" end of the war" was involved.
A foreign war may not be terminated in respect of various considerations arising under international law and
yet be concluded in respect of the rights and duties of
citizens of the United States under the Federal Constitution; and it does not follow that because a technical state
of war still prevails between the United States, Germany
and Austria, notwithstanding the complete demobilization
of our army and navy, the constitutional rights of the
citizens of the United States are to be tested as if war
actually existed. It is not necessary that there should
ever be a definite treaty of peace. History presents many
instances where there has been a "conclusion of war"
without any treaty of peace. Whether or not war has
been terminated is, after all, a question of fact to be determined in each case by the situation presented.
The War-time Prohibition Act has become obsolete
with the passing of the emergency [citing various rate
cases, and the Perrin and Gearlds Casq, which are considered in the court's opinion, infra, 162].

Mr. Levi Cooke and Mr. George R. Benneman, by leave

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
The armistice with Germany was signed November 11,
1918. Thereafter Congress passed and, on November 21,
1918, the President approved the War-Time Prohibition
Act (c. 212, 40 Stat. 1045, 1046), which provides as follows:
"That after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of
which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President
of the United States, for the purpose of conserving the
man power of the Nation, and to increase efficiency in the
production of arms, munitions, ships, food, and clothing for the Army and Navy, it shall be unlawful to sell
for beverage purposes any distilled spirits, and during
said time no distilled spirits held in bond shall be removed therefrom for beverage purposes except for export. . ..
On October 10, 1919, the Kentucky Distilleries and
Warehouse Company, owner of distillery warehouses and
of whisky therein, brought in the District Court of the
United States for the Western District of Kentucky a suit
against Hamilton, Collector of Internal Revenue for that
District, alleging that the above act was void or had
become inoperative and praying that he be enjoined from
interfering, by reason of that act, with the usual process of

withdrawal, distribution and sale of the whisky in bond.
The case was heard before the District Judge on plaintiff's
motion for a preliminary injunction and defendant's motion to dismiss. A decision without opinion was rendered
for the plaintiff; and, the defendant declining to plead
further, a final decree was entered granting a permanent
injunction in accordance with the prayer of the bill. A
similar suit seeking like relief was brought on October 29,
1919, by Dryfoos, Blum & qo., in the District Court of
the United States for the Southern District of New York,
against Edwards, Collector for that District. That case
was heard on November 5 before the District Judge on like
motions for a preliminary injunction and to dismiss. An
opinion was filed November 14, 1919, holding the act in
force; and on the following day a final decree was entered
dismissing the bill.
The essential facts in the two cases differ in this: In
the Kentucky case the whisky was stored in a distillery
warehouse; the plaintiff was the maker of the whisky;
had owned it prior to the passage of the act; and had,
since June 30, 1919, paid the revenue tax on part of it.
In the New York case the liquors were in general and
special bonded warehouses; the plaintiffs were jobbers;
and it does not appear when they became the owners of
the liquors. Both cases come here by direct appeal under
§ 238 of the Judicial Code, were argued on the same day,
and may be disposed of together. Four contentions
are made in support of the relief prayed for: (1) that
the act was void when enacted because it violated the
Fifth Amendment; (2) that it became void before these
suits
were brought by reason of the passing of the war
emergency;
(3) that it was abrogated or repealed by
the Eighteenth Amendment; (4) that by its own terms
it expired before the commencement of these suits. These
contentions will be considered in their order.
First: Is the act void because it takes private property

Opinion of the Court.

for public purposes without compensation in violation
of the Fifth Amendment? The contention is this: The
Constitution did not confer police power upon Congress.
Its power to regulate the liquor traffic must therefore
be sought for in the implied war powers; that is, the
power "to make all laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution" the war powers
expressly granted. Article I,' § 8, clause 18. Congress
might under this implied power temporarily regulate
the sale of liquor and, if reasonably necessary, forbid,
its sale in order to guard and promote the efficiency of
the men composing the army and the navy and of the
workers engaged in supplying them with arms, munitions,
transportation and supplies. McKinley v. United States,
249 U. S. 397, 399. But the exercise of the war powers
is (except in respect to property destroyed by military
operations, United States v. Pacific Railroad, 120 U. S.
227, 239) subject to the Fifth Amendment. United
States v. Russell, 13 Wall. 623, 627. The severe restriction
imposed by the act upon the disposition of liquors amounts
to a taking of property; andeing uncompensated would,
at least as applied to liquors acquired before the passage
of the act, exceed even the restriction held to be admissible
under the broad 'police powers possessed by the States.
Therefore, since it fails to make provision for compensation, which in every other instance Congress made
when authorizing the taking or use of property for war
purposes,' it is void. Such is the argument of the plaintiffs below.

That the United States lacks the police power, and that
this was reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment,
is true. But it is none the less true that when the United
States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the
Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the
fact that such exercise may be attended by the same
incidents which attend the exercise by a State of its
police power, or that it m'y tend to accomplish a similar
purpose. Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 357; McCray v.

States, 220 U. S. 45, 58; Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S.
308, 323; Seven Cases v. United States, 239 U. S. 510, 515;
United States v. Doremus, 249 U. S. 86, 93-94. The war
power of the United States, like its other powers and
like the police power of the States, is subject to applicable
constitutional limitations (Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2,

27, 61; United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, 326); but
the Fifth Amendment imposes in this respect no greater
limitation upon the national power than does the Fourteenth Amendment upon state power. In re Kemmler,

which $1,000,000 was appropriated.

Opinion of the Court.

tion upon the'use or disposition of property is such that
a State could, under the police power, impose it consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment without making
compensation, then the United States may for a permitted
purpose impose a like restriction consistently with the
Fifth Amendment without making compensation; for
prohibition of the liquor traffic is conceded to be an
appropriate means of increasing our war efficiency.
There was no appropriation of the liquor for public
purposes. The War-Time Prohibition Act fixed a period
of seven months and nine days from its passage during
which liquors could be disposed of free from any restriction
imposed by the Federal Government. Thereafter, until
the end of the war and the termination of demobilization,
it permits an unrestricted sale for export and, within
the United States, sales for other than beverage purposes.
The uncompensated restriction upon the disposition of
liquors imposed by this act is of a nature far less severe
than the restrictions upon the use of property acquired
before the enactment of the prohibitory law 'which were
held to be permissible in cases arising under the Fourteenth
Amendment. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 668;
Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 23. The question whether
an absolute prohibition of sale could be applied by a
State to liquor acquired before the enactment of the
prohibitory law has been raised by this court but not
answered, because unnecessary to a decision. Bartemeyer
v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 133; Beer Co. v. Massachusetts,
97 U. S. 25, 32-33; Eberle v. Michigan, 232 U. S. 700,
706; Barbour v. Georgia, 249 U. S. 454, 459. See, however, Mugler v. Kansas, supra, pp. 623, 625, 657. But no
reason appears why a state statute, which postpones its
effective date long enough to enable those engaged in
the business to dispose of stocks on hand at the date of
its enactment, should be obnoxious to the Fourteenth
Amendment; or why such a federal law should be ob-

noxious to the Fifth Amendment. We cannot say that
seven months and nine days was not a reasonable time
within which to dispose of all liquors in bonded warehouses on November 21, 1918. The amount then in
storage was materially less than was usually carried; 1
because no such liquor could be lawfully made in America
under the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act (August 10,
1917, c. 53, § 15, 40 Stat. 276, 282) after September 9,
1917. And if, as is suggested, the liquors remaining
in bond November 21, 1918, were not yet sufficiently
ripened or aged to permit them to be advantageously
disposed of within the limited period of seven months
and nine days thereafter, the resulting inconvenience
to the owner, attributable to the inherent qualities of
the property itself, cannot be regarded as a taking of
property in the constitutional sense. Clark Distilling
Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., 242 U. S. 311, 332.
Second: Did the act become void by the passing of the
war emergency before the commencement of these suits?
It is conceded that the mere cessation of hostilities under
the armistice did not abridge or suspend the power of
Congress to resort to prohibition of the liquor traffic
1 The amount of distilled spirits of all kinds in bonded warehouses June 30, 1919, was 72,358,151.1 gallons as compared with
282,036,460.2, June 30, 1914; 253,668,341.3 gallons, June 30, 1915;
232,402,878.3 gallons, June 30, 1916; 194,832,682.6 gallons, June 30,
1917; 158,959,264.5 gallons, June 30, 1918. Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for 1919, p. 173. The following explanation is given by the Commissioner, p. 51, why more was not withdrawn: "The high rates of tax on spirits, fermented liquors and wines
which were provided in the bill subsequently enacted into law as the
Revenue Act of 1918, prompted many dealers to make heavy purchases
of these commodities prior to the passage of the Act and, as a consequence of this action on the part of the dealers as well as of the expansion of prohibition territory throughout the United States the withdrawals from bonded warehouses materially declined after the passage
of the Act."

Opinion of the Court.

as a means of increasing our war efficiency; that the
support and care of the army and navy during demobilization was within the war emergency; and that, hence,
the act was valid when passed. The contention is that
between the date of its enactment and the commencement
of these suits it had become evident that hostilities would
not be resumed; that demobilization had been effected;
that thereby the war emergency was removed; and that
when the emergency ceased the statute became void.
To establish that the emergency has passed, statements and acts of the President and of other executive
officers are adduced; some of them antedating the enactment of the statute here in question. There are statements of the President to the effect that the war has

the President's veto the National Prohibition Act which,
in making further provision for the administration of
the War-Time Prohibition Act, treats the war as continuing and demobilization as incomplete; that the
Senate, on November 19, 1919, refused to ratify the
Treaty of Peace with Germany; I that under the provisions of the Lever Act the President resumed, on October
30, 1919, the control of the fuel supply which he had
relinquished partly on January 31, 1919, and partly
on February 20, 1919; 2 that he is still operating the

ilization,"-the progress of events since that time had
produced so great a change of conditions and there now is
so clearly a want of necessity for conserving the man power
of the nation, for increased efficiency in the production of
arms, munitions and supplies, that the prohibition of the
sale of distilled spirits for beverage purposes can no longer
be enforced, because it would be beyond the constitutional
authority of Congress in the exercise of the war power to
impose such a prohibition under present circumstances.
Assuming that the implied power to enact such a prohibition must depend not upon the existence of a technical state of war, terminable only with the ratification
of a treaty of peace or a proclamation of peace (United
States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 70;. The Protector, 12 Wall.
700, 702; Hijo v. United States, 194 U. S. 315, 323,) but
upon some actual emergency or necessity arising out of
the war or incident to it, still, as was said in Stewart v.
Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507, "The power is not limited to
victories in the field and the dispersion of the [insurgent]
forces. It carries with it inherently the power, to guard
against the immediate renewal of the conflict, and to
remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and
progress."
No principle of our constitutional law is more firmly
established than that this court may not, in passing upon
the validity of a statute, enquire into the motives of Congress. United States v. Des Moines Navigation Co., 142
U. S. 510, 544; McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27,
53-59; Weber v. Freed, 239 U. S. 325, 330; Dakota Central
Telephone Co. v. South Dakota, 250 U. S. 163, 184. Nor
may the court enquire into the wisdom of the legislation.

power is not an argument against its existence. Lottery
Case, 188 U. S. 321, 363.
That a statute valid when enacted may cease to have
validity owing to a change of circumstances has been
recognized, with respect to state laws, in several rate
cases. Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 473; Missouri
Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 474, 508; Lincoln Gas Co. v. Lincoln,
250 U. S. 256, 268. That the doctrine is applicable to acts
of Congress was conceded arguendo in Perrin v. United
States, 232 U. S. 478, 486; and Johnson v. Gearlds, 234 U.
S. 422, 446. In each of these cases Congress had prohibited the introduction of liquor into lands inhabited by
Indians, without specified limit of time; in one case the
prohibition was in terms perpetual; in the other it was
to continue "until otherwise provided by Congress." In
both cases it was contended that the constitutional power
of Congress over the subject-matter necessarily was
limited to what was reasonably essential to the protection
of the Indians. In the Perrin Case it was contended
(p. 4:82) that the power was transcended because the
prohibition embraced territory greatly in excess of what
the situation reasonably required, and because its operation was not confined to a designated period reasonable in
duration but apparently was intended to be perpetual.
In Johnson v. Gearlds the contention was (p. 442) that a
prohibition originally valid had become obsolete by
reason of changes in the character of the territory included in it and the status of the Indians therein. In both
cases the court, while assuming that since the power to
impose a prohibition of this character was incident to the
presence of the Indians and their status as wards of the
Government and did not extend beyond what was reasonably essential to their protection, it followed that a prohibition valid in the beginning would become inoperative
when in regular course the Indians affected were completely emancipated from federal guardianship and con-

Opinion of the Court.

trol, nevertheless held that the courts would not be justified in declaring that the restriction either was originally
invalid or had become obsolete if any considerable number
of Indians remained wards of the Government within the
prohibited territory. In each case the decision rested upon
the ground that the question what was reasonably essential to the protection of the Indians was one primarily for
the consideration of the law-making body; that Congress
was invested with a wide discretion; and that its actiony
unless purely arbitrary, must be accepted and given full
effect by the courts.
Conceding, then, for the purposes of the present case,
that the question of the continued validity of the war
prohibition act under the changed circumstances depends
upon whether it appears that there is no longer any
necessity for the prohibition of the sale of distilled spirits
for beverage purposes, it remains to be said that on obvious grounds every reasonable intendment must be made
in favor of its continuing validity, the prescribed period
of limitation not having arrived; that to Congress in the
exercise of its powers, not least the war power upon which
the very life of the nation depends, a wide latitude of discretion must be accorded; and that it would require a
clear case to justify a court in declaring that such an act,
passed for such a purpose, had ceased to have force because
the power of Congress no longer continued. In view of
facts of public knowledge, some of which have been
referred to, that the treaty of peace has not yet been
concluded, that the railways are still under national control by virtue of the war powers, that other war activities
have not been brought to a close, and that it can not even
be said that the man power of the nation has been restored
to a peace footing, we are unable to conclude that the act
has ceased to be valid.
Third: Was the act repealed by the adoption of the
Eighteenth Amendment? By the express terms of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Opinion of the Court.

251 U. S.

Amendment the prohibition thereby imposed becomes
effective after one year from its ratification. Ratification
was proclaimed on January 29, 1919, 40 Stat. 1941. The
contention is that, as the Amendment became on its adoption an integral part of the Constitution, its implications
are as binding as its language; that in postponing the
effective date of the prohibition the Amendment impliedly
guaranteed to manufacturers and dealers in intoxicating
liquors a year of grace; and that not only was Congress
prohibited thereby from enacting meanwhile new prohibitory legislation, but also that the then existing restriction imposed by the War-Time Prohibition Act was
removed. See Narragansett Brewing Co. v. Baker and
O'Shaunessy, U. S. D. Ct. R. I., November 12, 1919.
The Eighteenth Amendment with its implications, if
any, is binding not only in times of peace, but in war. If
there be found by implication a denial to Congress of the
right to forbid before its effective date any prohibition
of the liquor traffic, that denial must have been operative
immediately upon the adoption of the Amendment; although at that time demobilization of the army and the
navy was far from complete. If the Amendment effected
such a denial of power then it would have done so equally
had hostilities continued flagrant or been renewed. Furthermore, the Amendment is binding alike upon the
United States and the individual States. If it guarantees
a year of immunity from interference by the Federal
Government with the liquor traffic, even to the extent of
abrogating restrictions existing at the time of its adoption,
it is difficult to see why the guaranty does not extend also
to immunity from interference by the individual States,
with like results also as to then existing state legislation.
The contention is clearly unsound.
Fourth: Did the prohibition imposed by the act expire
by limitation before the commencement of these suits?
The period therein prescribed is "until the conclusion of

HAMILTON v. KENTUCKY DISTILLERIES CO.

Opinion of the Court.

the present war and thereafter until the termination of
demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and
proclaimed by the President of the United States." It is
contended both that the war has been concluded and that
the demobilization has terminated.
In the absence of specific provisions to the contrary the
period of war has been held to extend to the ratification
of the treaty of peace or the proclamation of peace. Hijo
v. United States, 194 U. S. 315, 323; The Protector, 12 Wall.
700, 702; United States v. Anderson, 9 Wall. 56, 70. From
the fact that other statutes concerning war activities contain each a specific provision for determining when it shall
cease to be operative,1 and from the alleged absence of
IThe provisions fixing the date of expiration of the-several war acts
are as follows:
(Aircraft Act being c. XVI, of the Army Appropriation Act of July 9,
1918, c. 143, 40 Stat. 889.) "Within one year from the signing of a
treaty of peace with the Imperial German Government."
(Departmental Reorganization Act of May 20, 1918, c. 78, 40 Stat.
556.) "That this Act shall remain in force during the continuance of
the present war and for six months after the termination of the war
by the proclamation of the treaty of peace."
(Emergency Shipping Fund Act of June 15, 1917, c. 29, 40 Stat. 182,
as amended by the Act of April 22, 1918, c. 62, 40 Stat. 535, and by
the Act of November 4, 1918, c. 201, 40 Stat. 1020.) "All authority . . . shall cease six months after a final treaty of peace is
proclaimed between this Government and the German Empire."

such a provision here, it is argued that the term "conclusion of the war" should not be given its ordinary legal
meaning; that instead it should be construed as the time
when actual hostilities ceased; or when the treaty of peace
was signed at Versailles, on June 28, 1919, by the American and German representatives; or, more generally, when
the actual war emergencies ceased by reason of our complete victory and the disarmament of the enemy coupled
with the demobilization of our army and the closing of war
activities; or when the declared purpose of the act of

"conserving the man power of the Nation, and to increase

when the existing state of war between the United States and Germany
shall have terminated, and the fact and date of such termination shall
be ascertained and proclaimed by the President."
(Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, c. 106, 40 Stat.
411, 412.) "The words .'end of the war' as used herein, shall
be deemed to mean the date of proclamation of exchange of ratifications of the treaty of peace, unless the President shall, by proclamation,
declare a prior date, in which case the date so proclaimed shall be
deemed to be the 'end of the war' within the meaning of this Act."
(Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of March 8, 1918, c. 20, 40
Stat. 440, at 441 and 449.) "(5) The term 'termination of the war'
as used in this Act shall mean the termination of the present war by
the treaty of peace as proclaimed by the President. . . . Sec. 603.
That this Act shall remain in force until the termination of the war, and
for six months thereafter."
(Saulsbury Resolution of May 31, 1918, c. 90, 40 Stat. 593.) "That
until a treaty of peace shall have been definitely concluded between the
United States and the Imperial German Government, unless in the
meantime otherwise provided by Congress
.
(Wheat Price Guarantee Act of March 4, 1919, c. 125, § 11, 40 Stat.
1348, 1353.) "That the provisions of this Act shall cease to be in
effect whenever the President shall find that the emergency growing out
of the war with Germany has passed and that the further execution
of the provisions of this Act is no longer necessary for its purposes,
the date of which termination shall be ascertained and proclaimed by
the President; but the date when this Act shall cease to be in effect
shall not be later than the first day of June, nineteen hundred and
twenty."

Opinion of the Court.

efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, ships,
food, and clothing for the Army and Navy" shall have
been fully satisfied. But there is nothing in the words
used to justify such a construction. "Conclusion of the
war" clearly did not mean cessation of hostilities; because
the act was approved ten days after hostilities had ceased
upon the signing of the armistice. Nor may we assume
that Congress intended by the phrase to designate the
date when the treaty of peace should be signed at Versailles or elsewhere by German and American representatives, since by the Constitution a treaty is only a proposal
until approved by the Senate. Furthermore, to construe
"conclusion of the war" as meaning the actual termination of war activities, would leave wholly uncertain the
date when the act would cease to be operative; whereas
Congress evinced here, as in other war statutes, a clear
purpose that the date of expiration should be definitely
fixed. The reason why this was not directed to be done
by a proclamation of peace is made clear by the use of the
word "thereafter." It was expected that the "conclusion
of the war" would precede the termination of demobilization. Congress, therefore, provided that the time when
the act ceased to be operative should be fixed by the
President's ascertaining and proclaiming the date when
demobilization had terminated.
It is insisted that he has done so. The contention
does violence to both the language and the evident
purpose of the provision. The "date of which shall be
determined and proclaimed by the President" is a phrase'
so definite as to leave no room for construction. This
requirement cannot be satisfied by passing references
in messages to Congress, nor by newspaper interviews
with high officers of the army or with officials of the
War Department. When the President mentioned in
his veto message the "demobilization of the army and
navy" the words were doubtless used in a popular sense,

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.

251 U. S.

just as he had declared to Congress, on the occasion of
the signing of the armistice: "The war thus comes to
an end." If he had believed on October 28, 1919, that
demobilization had, in an exact sense, terminated, he
would doubtless have issued then a proclamation to
that effect; for he had manifested a strong conviction
that restriction upon the sale of liquor should end. Only
by such proclamation could the purpose of Congress
be attained; and the serious consequences attending
uncertainty be obviated. But in fact demobilization
had not terminated at the time of the veto of the Act
of October 28, 1919; or at the time these suits were begun;
and, for aught that appears, it has not yet terminated.
The Report of the Secretary of War made to the President
under date of November 11, 1919 (and transmitted to
Congress on December 1), in describing the progress
of demobilization, shows (p. 17) that during the preceding ten days (November 1-10) 2,018 officers and
10,266 enlisted men had been discharged; the rate of
discharge being substantially the same as during the
month of October-in which 8,690 officers and 33,000
enlisted men were discharged.
The War-Time Prohibition Act being thus valid and
still in force, the decree in Number 589 is reversed and
the case is remanded to the District Court with directions
to dismiss the bill; and the decree in Number 602 is
affirmed.
No. 589. Reversed.
