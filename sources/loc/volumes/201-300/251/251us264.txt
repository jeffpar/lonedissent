JACOB RUPPERT, A CORPORATION, v. CAFFEY,
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 603.

Argued November 20, 21, 1919.-Decided January 5, 1920.

The War-Time Prohibition Act was within the war power of Congress
when passed and had neither become invalid by change of circumstances nor expired by its own terms when this suit was begun.
P. 281. Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries& Warehouse Co., ante, 146.
For the same reasons, Congress had power to enact new prohibitions,
at the time when the National Prohibition Act, infra, was passed.
P. 282.
The National Prohibition Act (October 28, 1919, Title I, § 1) in its
provision that "The words 'beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt
or vinous liquors' in the War Prohibition Act shall be hereafter
construed to mean any such beverages which contain one-half of 1

per centum or more of alcohol by volume," held constitutional.
P. 282.
As a measure reasonably necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicating liquors effectual, Congress in the exercise of the war power
may prohibit those containing as much as one-half of 1 per cent. by
volume of alcohol, even though they be not in fact intoxicating. Id.
The argument that power to prohibit non-intoxicating liquors is
merely an incident to the power to prohibit intoxicating liquors,
implied from clause 18, § 8, of Art. I, of the Constitution, and cannot be upheld, because one implied power cannot be grafted upon
another, is merely a mater of words, since, rightly understood,
the power .in question is a single, broad power, not merely to prohibit but to prevent the liquor traffic, like the police power of the
States as applied to the same subject. P. 299.
Some confusion of thought might perhaps have been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers by the term express and implied, the term specific and general had been used; for the power
conferred by clause 18, § 8, of Art. I, "to make all laws which shall
be necessary and proper for carrying into execution" powers specifically granted, is itself an express power. P. 300.

JACOB RUPPERT v. CAFFEY.
264.

Argument for Appellant.

The fact that the above-cited provision of the National Prohibition
Act entails peculiar hardship and loss to owners of breweries and
manufactured beer by becoming effective immediately upon its
passage, does not render it arbitrary and unreasonable. P. 301.
Such immediate prohibition did not amount to a taking of the nonintoxicating beer previously acquired, for which compensation must

be made. P. 302.
The action of the President, under the Food Control Act, in at first
permitting the production of malt liquors containing not more than
2.75 per cent. of alcohol, in next extending the prohibition to all
malt liquors for beverage purposes irrespective of alcoholic content,

and in afterwards limiting the prohibition to intoxicating malt
liquors, held, not to import a finding that 2.75 per cent. beer is nonintoxicating or to raise any equity in favor of an owner of beer manufactured after the President's authority over the subject had ceased.
P. 303.

Affirmed.
THE case is stated in the opinioi.

Mr. Elihu Root and Mr. William D. Guthrie, with whom
Mr, William L. Marbury was on the briefs, for appellant:
The war powers of the United States are complete and
sufficient for all war purposes and comprehend the right
to employ any appropriate means found necessary and
proper for prosecuting a war and plainly adapted to that
end. Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366, 377; Northern PacificRy. Co. v. North Dakota, 250 U. S. 135, 149; SalamandraIns. Co. v. N. Y. Life Insurance & Trust Co., 254
Fed. Rep. 852, 858. Those powers, however, are clearly
divided between Congress and the President. All the executive power exercisable in connection with the waging or
conducting of war is vested exclusively in the President by
virtue, not only of his office as President, but of his powers
as Commander-in-chief. Ex parte Milligan,4 Wall. 2, 139.
It may be conceded that whilst war was being actually
waged between April, 1917, and November, 1918, and
whilst the country continued on a war-footing With the
army and navy not yet demobilized, Congress could, if

necessary and proper for the prosecution of the war while
raging, or the support of the army and maintenance of
the navy pending demobilization, prohibit the use and
consumption of food products in the manufacture of beverages, whether or not intoxicating, and prohibit the manufacture, sale and use of intoxicating liquors. But it is
urged that any such incidental war power of prohibition,
which would necessarily interfere with the liberties and
property rights of the people of the United States and the
governmental powers reserved to the several States, can
be exercised only in cases of existing war emergency or
military necessity. In other words, the rights of the
States cannot be even temporarily violated unless a war
emergency reasonably warrants such action. This follows
from the very nature of our federal system and the duty
of Congress and the President not to violate the express
reservations of powers to the States, embodied in the
Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, or the constitutional rights of the individual.
Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 273, 276; Keller v.
United States, 213 U. S. 138, 144; Vance v. Vandercook
Co., 170 U. S. 438, 444; Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 24;
McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405; Houston v.
Moore, 5 Wheat. 1, 48.
The business of brewing beer is authorized, licensed and
regulated in a number of the States, as in the State @f
New York, and any legislation of Congress prohibiting
the manufacture and sale of beer must necessarily operate to override state policy and authority and state legislation, as well as to deprive many States of a present
source of large revenue from taxation necessary for the
support and maintenance of their respective state governments. In the State of New York alone, such annual
revenue amounted in 1916 to over $21,000,000, in 1917
to over $20,700,000 and in 1918 to over $22,500,000.
Hundreds of millions of dollars are invested in the

Argument for Appellant.

brewing business and to many thousands of citizens it is
their only means of livelihood. The rights of all engaged
in such a business, heretofore always expressly authorized
and licensed by both federal and state governments, ought
not to be subject to selection for violation and destruction under the pretext of the exercise of the war powers
of Congress at a time when no actual war emergency or
military necessity calls for any such prohibition, and
when no other class in the Nation is being subjected to
any such prohibition or discrimination or called upon to
make any such contribution or sacrifice to the common
welfare on any plea whatever. On behalf of the brewers,
whose property and business are now threatened with
destruction long before the Eighteenth Amendment will
become effective as the source of any additional power
to Congress or as a limitation upon the reserved rights of
the States and their peoples, it is submitted that the rights
and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution are not suspended and do not cease to be effective guarantees during a period of war, and are not subject to denial or curtailment by war measures, whether by the Congress or
the President, unless an actual war emergency or military
necessity so requires, and then only during the period of
such war emergency or military necessity. Mitchell v.
Harmony, 13 How. 115, 149; Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall.
2, 121; Raymond v. Thomas, 91 U. S. 712, 716.
It was undoubtedly the intention of the framers of the
Constitution to vest in the President the broadest war
powers, and to render him independent of Congress in
respect of the exercise of those powers in the actual conduct of a war. Hamilton, The Federalist, No. 74, Ford's
ed., p. 496; Kent's Comm., vol. 1, p. 282; Story on the
Constitution, § 149; Pomeroy, Constitutional Law, §§ 703714; Von Holst's Constitutional Law (Mason's translation), pp. 164, 192-195. His powers are here emphasized

to determine such questions as the existence or continuance of a war emergency or military necessity, and his
official declarations upon such a subject, in the absence
of other criteria, furnish the best evidence which the
nature of the case permits, and in the absence of all other
evidence are conclusive.
The existence of a war emergency must be the- basis
and warrant for the exercise of an implied war power,
which tends to deny the rights of an individual or a State,
and the courts are not concluded by the mere declaration
of Congress, whether express or implied, that such an
emergency actually exists, or shall be presumed to continue for some indefinite period in the future. Ex parte
Milligan, 4 Wall. 2; Willoughby, Constitutional Law,
vol. 2, p. 1251.
The ruling and doctrine of the Milligan Case have
never been questioned by the court. With entire uniformity the authorities have laid down and applied the
rule of actual necessity or emergency as the test of the
authority of the Congress or the President to exercise
any incidental war power in derogation of the constitutional rights of the citizen. Mitchell v. Harmony, 13 How.
115, 135; Raymond v. Thomas, 91 U. S. 712, 716; Milligan
v. Hovey, 3 Biss. 13; In re Egan, 5 Blatchf. 319; McLaughlin v. Green, 50 Mississippi, 453; Johnson v. Jones,
44 Illinois, 142, 154; Griffin v. Wilcox, 21 Indiana, 370;
Nance & Mays v. Brown, 71 W. Va. 519, 524; United
States v. Hicks, 256 Fed. Rep. 707; Legal Tender Cases,
12 Wall. 457, 540.
To argue that the war with Germany and Austria is
not yet legally and formally terminated does not meet
the point at all. The existence of actual war emergency
and not mere de jure war is the controlling test of the
right to deny the constitutional rights of citizens of the
United States. That is clearly the doctrine of the Milligan
Case. The mere fact that a de jure state of war still exists

JACOB RUPPERT v. CAFFEY.
264.

Argument for Appellant.

would not warrant the subversion of state rights or constitutional immunities, if there be as matter of fact no
actual war emergency.
The cases which hold that, strictly and legally speaking, the war will not be terminated until a treaty of peace
is ratified, mostly deal with such matters as the statute
of limitations or the rights of aliens. Of course, an alien
enemy ordinarily cannot sue until peace has been formally
restored, and, therefore, the running of the statute is suspended in the meanwhile; but such precedents have no
bearing upon the question here under discussion.
The contention of the Government seems to be that
the right of Congress to exert its war powers is absolute,
that the question as to what particular measures are necessary is committed wholly to the discretion of Congress
and that the judgment of Congress when expressed is not
subject to review by the courts. It is submitted that
this contention is clearly in conflict with the fundamental
doctrine upon which this court has uniformly proceeded
ever since the decision in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch,
137, and that it has long been settled that Congress is
never the sole judge of the extent of its powers or of the
existence of jurisdictional facts authorizing its action. It
must be borne in mind that practically all the war powers
of Congress, such as to raise and support armies and to
provide and maintain a navy, exist and must be exercised
in times of peace as well as war. These powers are expressly delegated and not limited to war times. But the
incidental or implied powers are expressly limited to those
"which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into
execution" the delegated powers, and Congress is never
the sole judge of their appropriateness. The contention
of the Government is fully refuted by the reasoning of
Mr. Chief Justice Chase in Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall.
603, 617.
The present contention on behalf of the Government

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Appellant.

251 U. S.

is, in final analysis, that the assumption by Congress of
a power to prohibit intoxicating and non-intoxicating
beverages during a technical state of war is absolutely
conclusive and precludes any inquiry by the courts as to
the conditions actually existing when the acts in question
were passed as alleged war measures, or when they are
sought to be enforced against the individual. If sound,
this view would vest in Congress as well as in the President the broadest autocratic and despotic war powers,
as soon as a technical state of war arose.
But it should be manifest that during the existence of
a state of war neither Congress nor the President becomes
vested ipso facto with unlimited and despotic power
throughout the United States, where no actual hostilities
are being conducted, and that neither branch of the Government becomes the sole judge of the appropriateness of
any means it may determine to be necessary and proper
as a war measure. Otherwise, the moment a nominal or
legal state of war arose, although without actual hostilities or very limited hostilities (as in the case -of the war
at sea with France in 1798 or with Tripoli in 1801), the
Congress and the President would at once become vested
with unlimited despotic powers to determine arbitrarily
what means were necessary and proper, which would
mean that during the existence of any period of war (and
even as the Government suggested on the oral argument
below during the period of all aftermaths of the war)
Congress and the President in their several departments
would be vested with such autocratic and despotic powers
that the people. of the United States would be quite at
their mercy.
Fortunately, no such doctrine has ever been tolerated
by this court. On the contrary, ever since the great case
of McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421, the assumption of power by Congress or the Executive has
never been held to be conclusive, The controlling judicial

Argument for Appellant.

inquiry always has been recognized to be whether the end
in view is or is not legitimate at the time of the passage
and enforcement of an act of Congress; whether it is or
is not an appropriate means to such a legitimate end,
and whether it is or is not then plainly adapted to that
end.
Furthermore, the constitutionality of any statute,
whether criminal or not, must be determined as of the
time and in the light of the circumstances existing when
it. is sought to be enforced against the individual. Castle
v. Mason, 91 Oh. St. 296, 303. The justiciable question
always is whether or not a statute sought to be applied
in a particular case against a person complaining or defending, does or does not violate the constitutional rights
of that person at the time its terms and provisions are
attempted to be enforced. The rate cases furnish a striking example and analogy. Lincoln Gas & Electric Light
Co. v. Lincoln, 250 U. S. 256, 269; Minnesota Rate Cases,
230 U. S. 352, 473; Missouri Rate Cases, ib. 474, 508;
Knoxville v. Knoxwlle Water Co., 212 U. S. 1, 18; Willcox
v. Consolidated Gas Co., ib. 19, 54; and particularly Municipal Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 225 N. Y. 89, 95,
97. This court recognized the principle now being urged
in Johnson v. Gearlds, 234 U. S. 422, 446, and Perrin v.
United States, 232 U. S. 478, 486.
The question before the court is, therefore, solely this:
Is there now such actual war emergency or necessity in
this country as would in any reasonable aspect warrant
the enforcement of the new and extensive prohibitions
contained in the Act of October 28, 1919? The President
has emphatically and unequivocally answered this inquiry
in the negative in his messages to Congress of' May 20th
and October 27th. And Congress itself in the very act
now before the court has recognized that the war is practically concluded by referring thereto in § 38 of title II
as "the recent war."

272

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Appellant.

251 U. S.

In all the cases heretofore cited in support of war legislation, the legislation was warranted as of the date when
it was operative and sought to be enforced. But none
of them intimated that a person might be deprived of
his liberty or property at some future date under the
exercise of the war power, notwithstanding the fact
that no actual war necessity for the sacrifice or denial
of his constitutional rights might as matter of fact then
exist.
The cases of Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota,
250 U. S. 135; Dakota Central Telephone Co. v. South
Dakota, ibid. 163; Burleson v. Dempcy, ibid. 191; MacLeod
v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., ibid. 195;
and Commercial Cable Co. v. Burleson, 255 Fed. Rep. 99,
s. c., 250 U. S. 360, in no way sustain the proposition
that any implied declaration by Congress would be conclusive as to the existence of a present necessity justifying the prohibitions in question.
The justiciable question as to the existence or continuance of a war emergency presents, it is true, a very high
and delicate matter of public law and may as such involve
grave difficulties of proof. In the absence of satisfactory
evidence, the court might decline to hold' that Congress
had acted without authority in view of the continuance
of a de jure state of war until a treaty of peace has been
formally ratified. But the case at bar involves no such
difficulty of proof because the President himself has in
effect proclaimed in his veto message of October 27, 1919,
and in other declarations that the war emergencies, which
alone could uphold the prohibition legislation now in
question, no longer exist.
In view of the war powers and responsibilities of the
President and his express duty to inform Congress as to
the state of the Union, it must be clear that it is especially
fit and proper that he should determine officially as to
the existence or continuance of a war emergency, and

JACOB RUPPERT v. CAFFEY.
264.

Argument for Appellant.

that, in the absence of other proof, his declarations as
to this question of fact of actual date and condition should
be deemed the best evidence and the most certain criteria.
It involves a matter peculiarly within his knowledge and
jurisdiction, and in such a matter the decision of the
President, as Executive and Commander-in-chief, ought
to be accepted as conclusive in the absence of any other
proof or criteria.
If it be urged again by the Government that the question whether a war emergency exists or continues is in
great measure a political question, to be conclusively determined by the political branch of the Government, surely
it is none the less political and conclusive when it is decided by the President, and a fortiori so when there is no
evidence either before Congress or the courts to the contrary of, or in any way impeaching, his finding.
Some of the reasons for attributing the greatest weight
to the declarations of the President as to the actual state
of the country, in war as well as in peace, are stated by
Mr. Justice Story in his Commentaries, § 1561. And see
Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19; Luther v. Borden, 7 How.
144; Prize Cases, 2 Black, 635; The Protector, 12 Wall.
700, 702.
It would present a very strange anomaly if it were to
be held that notwithstanding the solemn official declarations of the President, in respect of a matter peculiarly
within his knowledge and jurisdiction, to the effect that
a particular war emergency no longer existed calling for
or justifying prohibition, the Congress could nevertheless disregard his findings and proceed to enact legislation based upon the assumption of a contrary state of
facts.

The condition of the Act of November 21, 1918, has
been satisfied.
The President has sufficiently proclaimed the conclusion of the war and demobilization.

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Argument for Appellant.

251 U. S.

The Act of November 21, 1918, had been judicially
interpreted by ten United States District Courts to include only intoxicating beverages; the Act of October 28,
1919, provides that hereafter the prohibition shall be construed to mean such beverages which contain one-half of
one percentum or more of alcohol. It cannot, of course,
operate to overthrow the decisions of the courts as to the
true construction of the prior act, or apply to alleged
offenses committed before the passage of the new act.
Jaehne v. New York, 128 U. S. 189.
Therefore, the controlling question in the case at bar
is whether on October 28, 1919, such a war condition or
emergency existed as would constitutionally warrant the
exercise of the war powers of Congress in derogation or
destruction of the constitutional and property rights of
the complainant and other brewers of the United States.
The act establishes a new and different rule for the future,
and thus what has heretofore been wholly lawful is" hereafter" to be a crime. Harmless beverages which were
freely and legally manufactured and sold while the war
was at its height and while the Act of November 21, 1918,
was alone in effect, are now declared to be prohibited and
their value as property to be destroyed, and that too as
a war measure! New and most drastic punishments are
provided for the new offenses created.
The language of the Eighteenth Amendment presents
a very grave question as to the power of Congress to
enact prohibition legislation effective before the expiration of one year from the ratification of that Amendment.
Congress and the people of the United States, who proposed and adopted this Amendment in war time, clearly
intended that the power to prohibit intoxicating liquors
should not be exercised by Congress until the expiration
of one year from ratification. They appreciated that the
Amendment meant the destruction of large industries
worth hundreds of millions of dollars without any com-

JACOB RUPPERT v. CAFFEY.
264.

Argument for Appellant.

pensation at all and the means of livelihood of thousands
of persons, as Well as the withdrawal from the States of a
source of large revenue. Accordingly, they decreed by
express constitutional provision that there should be one
year of grace in order to serve practically in lieu of compensation, and to give those engaged in the industries affected a fair and reasonable opportunity to wind up their
businesses, adjust and liquidate their affairs, and find
new occupations with a minimum of hardship and social
dislocation, and to enable States and municipalities to
accommodate and readjust their fiscal systems to the
new order. Cong. Rec., December 17, 1917, p. 432.
Even if the war were still active and flagrant, the provision of the Amendment, adopted during war times,
should limit and qualify any implied war power in derogation thereof, and certainly so as to emergencies which
existed when the Amendment was proposed and adopted.
No implied war power to ban both intoxicants and nonintoxicants should be held to exist at the present time in
the very face of the fact that the constitutional amendment itself expressly deferred the prohibition for one year
and impliedly guaranteed to all those engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling intoxicating liquors that
they should meanwhile remain unmolested, so far as the
exercise of federal power of prohibition was concerned,
until the expiration of one year from the date of ratification. It is in effect proposed to add to the Amendment a
proviso authorizing Congress to deny any time of grace
if deemed necessary and proper as a war measure!
It does not follow that the Government would have
been disabled from meeting new emergencies of war if
they had arisen after the ratification of this Amendment.
Congress could always authorize condemnation of whatever food products or other property might- be needed
for war purposes, or ration the food of the country, or,
in the exercise of its powers to make rles for the army

251 U. S.

and navy, forbid liquor to be sold to soldiers and sailors,
etc. Only general federal prohibition was impliedly forbidden during the year of grace.
Even if Congress in the exercise of its war powers could
prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors,
it could not prohibit the manufacture and sale of beverages which are indisputably and concededly non-intoxicating. Any such stretch of legislation, if upheld as incidental to any incidental war power of Congress to
prohibit intoxicating liquors, would carry the incidental
power of Congress beyond anything yet approved or permitted by this court. The reasoning which is advanced
to uphold this extension of power under the National
Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, would practically
overthrow the doctrine of Hammer v. Dagenhart,247 U. S.
251, 273, 276, and analogous cases, denying to Congress
any such general police power in aid of its express powers.
The case of Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192,
presented for consideration solely the police powers of the
States in so far as they were limited by the Fourteenth
Amendment. The national government has no police
power and may not, therefore, enact laws prohibiting the
manufacture and sale of intoxicants simply because Congress deems that course advisable for the public welfare.
The Purity Extract Co. Case, moreover, prohibited all
malt liquors, whether intoxicating or not, because malt
beverages might be used to conceal intoxicating malt
liquors. No such object can be attributed to the Act of
Congress of October 28, 1919, because it does not prohibit
all malt liquors, but divides them by an arbitrary standard of percentage of alcohol.
It does not follow that because Congress may exercise
the power of prohibiting intoxicants in war time, it can
go further and ban non-intoxicants as an incident to this
implied incidental power. The Constitution merely confers upon Congress the right to exercise powers incidental

JACOB RUPPERT v. CAFFEY.
264.

Argument for Appellant.

to enumerated powers if necessary and proper, not the
right to exercise powers incidental to implied incidental
powers. Any other theory would strip the States of all
their powers for, if each implied incidental power breeds
new powers by added implication, there is no point at
which the process can be halted, but the result must in
time be one consolidated government in place of our
present federal system. The fallacy of such a doctrine
was early exposed by Jefferson in a letter to Livingston
(Ford's Jefferson, vol. VII, p. 44). See, also, McCulloch
v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 411; 3 Hamilton's Works
(Lodge's ed.), p. 192; 1 Congressional Debates, p. 1899
(Madison, Feb., 1791); 22 Annals of Congress, p. 212
(Clay, Feb., 1811); Rept. No. 1143, House of Rep., Feb.
26, 1919, pp. 7, 9.
The Act of Congress of October 28, 1919, is particularly
unjust and oppressive in respect of the brewers of the
United States. These brewers were engaged in manufacturing and selling a beverage which is non-intoxicating,
which was expressly authorized by the President in his
proclamation of December 8, 1917, in force during a large
part of the war period, and which was prohibited by him
only in his proclamation of September 16, 1918, when the
conservation of all the food products of the country became necessary. Millions of dollars worth of non-intoxicating beer have been manufactured in good faith in
reliance upon the proclamations of the President of January 30 and March 4, 1919, and the value of all this
product will in large measure be destroyed by the operation of the Act of October 28, 1919, if it be constitutional,
without any compensation whatever, on the theory that
this sacrifice of the property of a particular class at this
time is necessary and proper for carrying into execution
the war powers of the Nation!

which, see United States v. Standard Brewery, ante, 210.1
The Solicitor General and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Friersonfor appellees.
MR. JUsTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
By the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53, § 15, 40 Stat. 276,
282, a war measure known as the Lever Act, Congress
prohibited the use after September 9, 1917, of food materials or feeds in the production of distilled spirits for beverage purposes and authorized the President to limit or
prohibit their use in the production of malt or vinous
liquors for beverage purposes, so far as he might, from
time to time, deem it essential to assure an adequate
supply of food, or deem it helpful in promoting the national
security or defense. Under the power so conferred the
President, by proclamation of December 8, 1917, 40 Stat.
1728, prohibited the production after January 1, 1918, of
any "malt liquor except ale and porter""containing more
than 2.75 per centum of alcohol by weight. By proclamation of September 16, 1918, 40 Stat. 1848, the prohibition
was extended to "malt liquors, including near beer, for

beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contain alcohol"; and by proclamation of March 4, 1919, 40
Stat. 1937, the prohibition was limited "to intoxicating
malt liquors." Under § 2 of the act the duty of enforcing
the above provisions was assigned to the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue. This act contained no provision prohibiting the sale of intoxicating or other liquors.
On November 21, 1918, the so-called War-Time Prohibition Act (c. 212, 40 Stat. 1045) was approved. It provided that:
"After May first, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until
the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the
termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be
determined and proclaimed by the President of the United
States, no grains, cereals, fruit or other food product
shall be used in the manufacture or production of beer,
wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes. After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and
nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and
thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the
date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the
President of the United States, no beer, wine, or other
intoxicating malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage
purposes except for export.
"
On February 6, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue ruled (Treasury Decision 2788) that a beverage
containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol
by volume would be regarded as intoxicating within the
intent of the Act of November 21, 1918; and that after
May 1, 1919, persons would not be permitted to qualify
as brewers, if the alcoholic content of their product
equalled or exceeded that percentage. In so ruling
the Commissioner adopted and applied to this prohibitory act the same classification of malt liquors which
had been applied in administering the laws concerning
the taxation of beer and other similar fermented liquors.

OCTOBER TERM, i919.
Opinion of the Court.

251 U. S.

For since 1902 (Treasury Decision 514) fermented liquor
containing as much as one-half of one per centum of alcohol
had been treated as taxable under Rev. Stats. §§ 3339
and 3242; and this classification was expressly adopted in
the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, c. 63, § 307, 40
Stat. 311. The correctness of this construction of the act
was promptly and earnestly controverted by the brewers,
who insisted that Congress had intended to prohibit the
production only of such beer or other malt liquors as were
in fact intoxicating. The attempt was then made to remove the doubt by new legislation before May 1, 1919,
when the act would by its terms become operative. On
February 26 the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably an amendment to H.R. 13581 providing:
"The words 'beer, wine or other intoxicating malt or
vinous liquors' in the war prohibition act shall be construed to mean any liquors which contain in excess of onehalf of one per centum of alcohol." The Sixty-fifth Congress ended on ,March 4 without acting on this bill; and
the Sixty-sixth Congress did not convene in Extra Session
until May 19. On June 30, the House Committee on the
Judiciary reported substantially the same provision as § 1
of Title I of H. R._6810; but it was not enacted until October 28, 1919, when as the Volstead Act it was passed over
the President's veto.a
Norn (a):"The term 'War Prohibition Act' used in this Act shall mean the
provisions of any Act or Acts prohibiting the sale and manufacture of
intoxicating liquors until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall
be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States.
The words 'beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors'
in the War Prohibition Act shall be hereafter construed to mean any
such beverages which contain one-half of 1 per centum or more of
alcohol by volume: Provided, That the foregoing definition shall not
extend to dealcoholized wine nor to any beverage or liquid produced
by the process by which beer, ale, porter or wine is produced, if it con-

Opinion of the Court.

Immediately after the passage of the Volstead Act, this
suit was brought in the District Court of the United States
for the Southern District of New York by Jacob Ruppert
against Caffey, United States Attorney, and McElligott,
Acting Collector of Internal Revenue, to enjoin the enforcement as against the plaintiff of the penalties provided in the War-Time Prohibition Act as amended by the
Volstead Act. It was heard below on plaintiff's motion
for a preliminary injunction and defendants' motion to
dismiss; and having been dismissed, was brought here by
direct appeal under § 238 of the Judicial Code. The bill
alleged that plaintiff, the owner of a brewery and appurtenances, was on October 28, 1919, engaged in the manufacture of a beer containing more than one-half of one
per centum of alcohol by volume and less than 2.75 per
centum by weight or 3.4 per centum by volume, and had
then on hand a large quantity of such beer; and that this
beer was not in fact intoxicating. Plaintiff contended
(1) that the Act of November 21, 1918, had become void
or had expired by its own terms before the bill was filed;
(2) that its prohibition by its terms was limited to beer
which was in fact intoxicating; (3) that the Act of October
28, 1919, Title I, § 1, which purported to extend the prohibition to the manufacture and sale of beer not in fact
intoxicating, exceeded the war power of Congress; and
that thereby violation of rights guaranteed to plaintiff by
the Fifth Amendment was threatened.
This case was heard and decided below with Dryfoos v.
Edwards, ante, 146; and it was argued here on the- same
day with that case and Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries
& Warehouse Co., ante, 146. For the reasons set forth in
tains less than one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume, and is
made as prescribed in section 37 of Title II of this Act, and is otherwise
denominated than as beer, ale, or porter, and is contained and sold in,
or from, such sealed and labeled bottles, casks, or containers as the
commissioner may by regulation prescribe."

Opinion of the Court.

251 U. S.

the opinion in those cases, the Act of November 21, 1918,
was and remained valid as against the plaintiff and had
not expired. For the same reasons §1 of Title I of the Act
of October 28, 1919, was not invalid, merely because it
was new legislation. But it is insisted that this legislation is nevertheless void as against the plaintiff, because
Congress could not, even under its full war powers, prohibit
the manufacture and sale of non-intoxicants, and, at all
events, could not without making compensation, extend the
prohibition to non-intoxicating liquor acquired before the
passage of the act. These objections require consideration.
First: May the plaintiff show as a basis for relief that
the beer manufactured by it with alcoholic content not
greater than 2.75 per centum in weight and 3.4 per centum
in volume is not in fact intoxicating? The Government
insists that the fact alleged is immaterial since the passage
of the Volstead Act by which the prohibition of the manufacture and sale is extended to all beer and other malt
liquor containing as much as one-half of one per centum
of alcohol by volume.
If the war power of Congress to effectively prohibit the
manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in order to
promote the Nation's efficiency in men, munitions and
supplies is as full and complete as the police power of the
States to effectively enforce such prohibition in order to
promote the health, safety and morals of the community,
it is clear that this provision of the Volstead Act is valid,
and has rendered immaterial the question whether plaintiff's beer is intoxicating. For the legislation and decisions
of the highest courts of nearly all the States establish that
it is deemed impossible to effectively enforce either prohibitory laws or other laws merely regulating the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, if liability or inclusion within the law is made to depend upon the issuable
fact whether or not a particular liquor made or sold as a
beverage is intoxicating. In other words, it clearly appears

that a liquor law, to be capable 'of effective enforcement
must, in the opinion of the legislatures and courts of the
several States, be made to apply either to all liquors of the
species enumerated, like beer, ale or wine, regardless of
the presence or degree of alcoholic content; or if a more
general description is used, such as distilled, rectified,
spirituous, fermented, malt or brewed liquors, to all
liquors within that general description regardless of alcoholic content; b or to such of these liquors as contain

standards are combined so that certain specific and generic
liquors are altogether forbidden and such other liquors as
contain a given percentage of alcohol.
A test often used to determine whether a beverage is to
be deemed intoxicating within the meaning of the liquor
law is whether it contains one-half of -one per cent. of
alcohol by volume. A survey of the liquor laws of the
States reveals that'in seventeen States the test is either a
list of enumerated beverages without regard to whether
they contain any alcohol or the presence of any alcohol in
a beverage, regardless of quantity; c in eighteen States it

which if drunk to excess will produce intoxication."
Marks v. State, 159 Alabama, 71, 78, stated that "or other liquors

2. Arizona:-Constitution, Art. 23, § 1, prohibits "ardent spirits,
ale, beer, wine, or intoxicating liquor or liquors of whatever kind."
Brown v. State, 17 Arizona, 314, held that "beer" was prohibited
whether or not it was intoxicating.
3. Arkansas:-Acts of 1917, Act 13, p. 41, as amended by Acts of
1919, Act 87, p. 75, prohibits "any alcoholic, vinous, malt, spirituous

Seibert v. State, 121 Arkansas, 258, held that the enumerated liquors
are prohibited whether they are intoxicating or not if they contained
any alcohol.
An earlier act contained the words "or other intoxicating liquors"
following "or fermented liquors." It was held in Bradshaw v. State, 76

be intoxicating to be within the meaning of the statute.
Acts of 1914, No. 146, repeats a similar definition of grog-shop or
blind tiger. Acts of 1914, No. 211, forbids the manufacture of nearbeer with more than 1.59% of alcohol by weight or 2% by volume; and
prohibits the sale of the near-beer thus made under the same roof

That the Federal Government would, in attempting to

the reports of the House. Committee on the Judiciary in

of fixing a definite alcoholic test for the purpose of administering the limited prohibitory law included in the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15, § 12, 40 Stat. 76,
82
And the Attorney General, calling attention specifically to the claim made in respect to the 2.75 per cent.
beer, had pointed out to Congress that definition of
intoxicating liquor by fixed standards was essential to effective enforcement of the prohibition law.m It is thereNoTE (1):That statute made it "unlawful to sell any intoxicating liquor, including beer, ale, or wine, to any officer or member of the military
forces while in uniform." The Judge Advocate General having been
applied to for an opinion concerning its administration advised that:
In matters of military inquiry, the War Department regards a beverage
that contains 1.4% of alcohol as intoxicating liquor within the meaning
of § 12 of the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, and the regulations
of the President and the Secretary of War made thereunder; whether
beverages pre intoxicating liquors . . . in prosecution of civilians
is a question for the civil courts. (Opinions of Judge Advocate General,
250. December 4, 1918-Digest of 1918, p. 360.) See also opinion of
March 3, 1919-Digbst of 1919, p. 289.
NoTE (m):Referring to the proposed definition: "I do not think the wisdom of
such action on the part of Congress admits of doubt. It goes without
saying, I think, that if a law merely prohibits intoxicating liquors and
leaves to the jury in each case, from the evidence produced, to determine whether the liquor in question is' in fact, intoxicating or not, its
efficient and uniform administration will be impossible. The term
'intoxicating' is too indefinite and uncertain to produce anything like
uniform results in such trials. Of course, there are certain liquors so
generally known to be intoxicating that any court would take judicial
notice of this fact. But in the absence of a definition by Congress there
will be innumerable beverages as to which the claim will be made that
they do not contain enough alcohol to render them intoxicating.
These contentions will produce endless confusion and uncertainty.
These, I think, are substantially the reasons why Congress should itself
provide a definition.
"The importance of this matter has been very much emphasized by
our present efforts to enforce the war prohibition act. The claim is
being made that beer containing as much as 234 per cent. of alcohol is

Opinion of th6 Court.

fore clear both that Congress might reasonably have considered some legislative definition of intoxicating liquor
to be essential to effective enforcement of prohibition and
also that the definition provided by the Volstead Act was
not an arbitrary one.
Plaintiff's argument is equivalent to saying that the
war power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture and
sale of intoxicating liquors does not extend to the adoption
of such means to this end as in its judgment are necessary
to the effective administration of the law. The contention
appears to be, that since the power to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not expressly
granted to Congress, but is a power implied under § 8 of
Article I of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress
"to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into execution" powers expressly enumerated,
the power to prohibit non-intoxicants would be merely an
incident of the power to prohibit intoxicants; and that it
cannot be held to exist, because one implied power may not
be grafted upon another implied power. This argument is
a mere matter of words. The police power of a State over
the liquor traffic is not limited to the power to prohibit
the sale of intoxicating liquors supported by a separate
implied power to prohibit kindred non-intoxicating liquors
so far as necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicants
effective; it is a single broad power to make such laws, by
way of prohibition, as may be required to effectively suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors. Likewise the imnot intoxicating. And if this must be made a question of fact to be
decided by each jury, but little in the way of practical results can be
expected. I am, however, most earnestly insisting that, in view of the
rulings for many years by the Internal Revenue Department, Congress meant when it used the word 'beer' a beverage of the class generally known as beer if it contained as much as one half of 1 per cent. of
alcohol." Letter of Attorney General to Senator Morris Shepherd,
July 29, 1919, read in Senate, September 5, 1919, 58 Cong. Rec. 5185.

plied war power over intoxicating liquors extends to the
enactment of laws which will not merely prohibit the sale
of intoxicating liquors but will effectually prevent their
sale. Furthermore, as stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky
Distilleries & Warehouse Co., ante, 156, while discussing
the implied power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating
liquors: "When the United States exerts any of the powers
conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may
be attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise by a State of its police power
The distinction sought to be made by plaintiff between
the scope or incidents of an express power and those of an
implied power has no basis in reason or authority. Thus,
the Constitution confers upon Congress the express power
"to establish post offices and post roads" (Article I, §8,
clause 7). From this is implied the power to acquire land
for post offices in the several States, Battle v. United States,
209 U. S. 36; and as an incident of this implied power to
acquire land, the further power is implied to take it by
right of eminent domain. Kohl v. United States, 91 U. S.
367. Likewise, the Constitution confers by clause 3 the
express power "to regulate commerce . . . among the
several States"; but there is implied for this purpose also
the power to grant to individuals franchises to construct
and operate railroads from State to State. California v.
PacificR. R. Co., 127 U. S. 1, 39. Incidental to this implied
power to construct or authorize the construction of a railroad-is the further implied power to regulate the relations
of the railroad with its employees, Second Employers'
Liability Cases, 223 U. S. 1, 47; to require safety appliances
upon cars, even when used in intrastate commerce, Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20; and to regulate
freight rates even to the extent of affecting intrastate rates,
American Express Co. v. Caldwell, 244 U. S. 617. Whether
it be for purposes of national defense, or for the purpose

Opinion of the Court.

of establishing post offices and post roads or for the purpose
of regulating commerce among the several States Congress
has the power "to make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution" the duty so reposed in the Federal Government. While this is a Government of enumerated powers it has full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of those powers. In re Debs, 158
U. S. 564. Some confusion of thought might perhaps have
been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers
by the terms express and implied, the terms specific and
general had been used. For the power conferred by clause
18 of § 8 "to make all laws which shall be necessary and
proper for carrying into execution" powers specifically
enumerated is also an express power. Since Congress has
power to increase war efficiency by prohibiting the-liquor
traffic, no reason appears why it should be denied the
power to make its prohibition effective.
Second: Does the fact that Title I of the Volstead Act
took effect upon its passage render §1 invalid as against the
plaintiff? Prohibition of the manufacture of malt liquors
with alcoholic content of one-half of one per cent. or more
is permissible only because, in the opinion of Congress,
the war emergency demands it. If, in its opinion, the
particular emergency demands the immediate discontinuance of the traffic Congress must have the power to require such discontinuance. To limit the power of Congress so that it may require discontinuance only after the
lapse of a reasonable time from the passage of the act
would seriously restrict it in the exercise of the war powers.
Hardship resulting from making an act take ,effect upon
its passage is a frequent incident of permissible legislation;
but whether it shall be imposed rests wholly in the discretion of the law-making body. That the prohibition of the
manufacture of non-intoxicating beer, if permissible at all,
may be made to take effect immediately follows necessarily
from the principle acted upon in Mugler v. Kansas, 123

OCTOBER TERM, 1919.
Opinion of the Court.

251 U. S.

U. S. 623, 669, since the incidents attending the exercise
by Congress of the war power to prohibit the liquor traffic
are the same as those that attend the States' prohibition
under the police power. In the Mugler Case, also, the
breweries were erected at a time when the State did not
forbid the manufacture of malt liquors; and there it was
alleged that the prohibition, which became effective
almost immediately, would reduce the value of one of the
breweries by three-fourths and would render the other of
little value. Here, as there, the loss resulting to the plaintiff from inability to use the property for brewery purposes,
is an incident of the peculiar nature of the property and of
the war need which, we must assume, demanded that the
discontinuance of use be immediate. Plaintiff cannot complain because a discontinuance later would have caused
him a smaller loss. This, indeed, appears to be conceded so
far as concerns the brewery and appurtenances. The objection on the ground that the prohibition takes effect imdiately is confined to the prohibition of the sale of the beer
on hand at the time of the passage of the act. But as to
that also we cannot say that the action of Congress was
unreasonable or arbitrary.
Plaintiff contends however that even if immediate prohibition of the sale of its non-intoxicating beer is within
the wax power, .this can be legally effected, only provided
compensation is made; and it calls attention to the fact
that in Barbour v. Georgia, 249 U. S. 454, 459, following
some earlier cases, the question was reserved whether,
under the police power, the States could prohibit the sale
of. liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute.
It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments
affirmed in the Mugler Case, was one for violation of the
act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see pp.
625, 627); and that it was assumed without discussion that
the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (p.
669). But we are not required to determine here the limits

in this respect of the police power of the States; nor whether
the principle is applicable here under which the Federal
Government has been declared to be free from liability to
an owner," for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by
measures necessary to their safety and efficiency," United
States v. PacificRailroad,120 U. S. 227, 239; in analogy to
that by which States are exempt from liability for the
demolition of a house in the path of a conflagration, see
Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133, 136; or for garbage of valie
taken, Reduchon Co. v. Sanitary Works, 199 U. S. 306;
Gardner v. Michigan, 199 U. S. 325; or for unwholesome
food of value destroyed, North American Storage Co. v.
Chicago, 211 U. S. 306; Adams v. Milwaukee, 228 U. S.
572, 584; for the preservation of the public health. Here,
as in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co.,
supra, there was no appropriation of private property, but
merely a lessening of value due to a permissible restriction
imposed upon its use.
It is urged that the act is particularly oppressive in
respect to the beer on hand, because the plaintiff was engaged in manufacturing and selling a non-intoxicating
beverage expressly authorized by the President in his
proclamation of December 8, 1917, and prohibited by him
later, only when conservation of all the food products of
the country became necessary. The facts afford no basis
on which to rest the claim of an equity in the plaintiff's
favor. The specific permission from the President to manufacture 2.75 per cent. beer was not on the ground that
such beer was non-intoxicating; nor was it a declaration by
him that this beer was in fact non-intoxicating. The permission extended to all "ale and porter" which, everyone
knows, are intoxicating liquors.' This permission to
NoTE (n)':Webster defines ale as: "An intoxicating liquor made from an infu-

sion of malt by fermentation and the addition of a bitter, usually

make 2.75 per cent. beer was withdrawn December 1,
1918, under proclamation of September 16, 1918; and no
permission to manufacture specifically 2.75 per cent. beer
was ever thereafter given by the President. His later
proclamation (March 4, 1919) merely limited the prohibition of the use of foodstuffs to use in the production of
"intoxicating liquors." Whether 2.75 per cent. beer was
intoxicating was thus left by the President not only without a decision but without even an intimation. The statement of plaintiff that the 2.75 per cent. beer on hand was
manufactured under permission of the President is wholly
unfounded. It was not until July 1, 1919, when the WarTime Prohibition Act became operative in this respect,
that there was any prohibition of the sale of any liquors.
So far as appears, all the beer which the plaintiff had on
hand at the time of the passage of the Volstead Act was
manufactured by the plaintiff long after the President
had ceased to have any authority to forbid or to permit.

I cannot accept either the conclusion announced by the
court or the reasons advanced to uphold it. The importance of the principles involved impels a dissent.
We are not now primarily concerned with the wisdom
or validity of general legislation concerning liquors, nor
with the intoxicating qualities of beer, nor with measures
taken by a State under its inherent and wide general
powers to provide for public safety and welfare. Our
problem concerns the power of Congress and rights of

hostilities have ended and demobilization has been completed.
The Government freely admits, since the present cause
stands upon motion to dismiss a bill which plainly alleges
that the beer in question is non-intoxicating, we must
accept that allegation as true and beyond controversy.
In United States v. Standard Brewery, decided this day,
ante, 210, we rule in effect that for many months prior
to the Volstead Act, passed October 28, 1919, no law of
the United States forbade the production or sale of nonintoxicating malt liquors. And so the question for decision here distinctly presented, is this-Did Congress have
power on October 28, 1919, directly and instantly to prohibit the sale of a non-intoxicating beverage, theretofore
lawfully produced and which until then could have been
lawfully vended, without making any provision for compensation to the owner?
The Federal Government has only those powers granted
by the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment not
having become effective, it has no general power to prohibit the manufacture or sale of liquors. But by positive
grant Congress has been empowered: "To declare war,"
"to raise and support armies," "to provide and maintain
a navy," "to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces," "to make all laws
which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers ";and to these it is attempted
to trace the asserted power to prohibit sale of complainant's beer. (See concerning implied powers, Cooley's
Principles of Constitutional Law, 105; Story on the Constitution, 4th ed., § 1243.)
The argument runs-This court has held in Hamilton
v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., ante, 146, that
under a power implied because necessary and proper to
carry into execution the above named powers relating to
war, in October, 1919, Congress could prohibit the sale

of intoxicating liquors.

251 U. S.

In order to make such a prohibi-

tion effective the sale of non-intoxicating beer must be
forbidden. Wherefore, from the implied power to prohibit intoxicants the further power to prohibit this nonintoxicant must be implied.
The query at once arises: If all this be true, why may
not the second implied power engender, a third under
which Congress may forbid the planting of barley or hops,
the manufacture of bottles or kegs, etc., etc.? The mischievous consequences of such reasoning were long ago
pointed out in Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 21, where,
replying to a suggestion that under the expressly granted
power to regulate commerce, Congress might control related matters, it was said:
"The result would be that Congress would be invested,
to the exclusion of the States, with the power to regulate,
not only manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture,
stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining-in short, every
branch of human industry. For is there one of them that
does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate
or foreign market?"
For sixty years Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120, 125,
has been regarded as a splendid exemplification of the
protection which this court must extend in time of war
to rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and also as
decisive of its power to ascertain whether actual military
necessity justifies interference with such rights. The doctrines then clearly-I may add, courageously-announced,
conflict with the novel and hurtful theory now promulgated. A few pertinent quotations from the opinion will
accentuate the gravity of the present ruling.

for even these provisions, expressed in such plain English
words, that it would seem the ingenuity of man could
not evade them, are now, after the lapse of more than
seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and

good men foresaw that troublous times would arise, when
rulers and people would become restive under restraint,
and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish
ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of
constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established
by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught
them that what was done in the past might be attempted
in the future. The Constitution of the United States is
a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace,
and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of
men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever
invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies
of'government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy
or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is
based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary
to preserve its existence; as has been happily proved by
the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority.
"This nation, as experience has proved, cannot always
remain at peace, and has no right to expect that it will
always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached
to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of
law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and
Lincoln; and if this right is conceded, and the calamities
of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are
frightful to contemplate. If our fathers had failed to
provide for just such a contingency, they would have
been false to the trust reposed in them. They knewthe history of the world told them-the nation they were
founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved
in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight
goud not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged

at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For
this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the
inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in a written constitution the safeguards which time
had proved were essential to its preservation. Not one
of these safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the
Judiciary disturb, except the one concerning the writ of
habeas corpus."
By considering the circumstances existing when the
War-Time Prohibition Act was challenged, in order to
reach the conclusion announced in Hamilton v. Kentucky
Distilleries& Warehouse Co., supra, this court asserted its
right to determine the relationship between such an enactment and the conduct of war; the decision there really
turned upon an appreciation of the facts. And that the
implied power to enact such a prohibitive statute does not
spring from a mere technical state of war but depends
upon some existing necessity directly related to actual
warfare, was recognized. Treating that opinion as though
it asserted the existence of a general power delegated to
Congress to prohibit intoxicants, certain cases which declare our inability to interfere with a State in the exercise
of its police power (Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S.
192; Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S.31, etc.) are now cited,
and it is said they afford authority for upholding the
challenged statute. But those cases are essentially different from the present one, both as to facts and applicable
principles; the power exercised by the States was inherent,
ever present, limited only by the Fourteenth Amendment,
and there was no arbitrary application of it; the power of
Congress recognized in the Hamilton Case, and here relied upon must be inferred from others expressly granted
and should be restricted, as it always has been heretofore,
to actual necessities consequent upon war. It can only
support a measure directly relating to such necessities and
only so long as the relationship continues. Whether these

essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenged, presents a question for the courts; and, accordingly, we must come to this ultimate inquiry :-Can it be
truthfully said, in view of the well-known facts existing
on October 28, 1919, that general prohibition immediately
after that day of the sale of non-intoxicating beer theretofore lawfully manufactured, could afford any direct and
appreciable aid in respect of the war declared against
Germany and Austria?
What were the outstanding circumstances? During
the nineteen months-April, 1917, to November, 1918when active hostilities were being carried on, and for almost a year thereafter, Congress found no exigency requiring it to prohibit sales of non-intoxicating beers. The
armistice was signed and actual hostilities terminated
November 11, 1918. Our military and naval forces, with
very few exceptions, had returned and demobilization
had been completed. The production of war material and
supplies had ceased long before and huge quantities of
those on hand had been sold. The President had solemnly
declared, "The war thus comes to an end; for having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for
the German command to renew it." Also-" That the
object of the war is attained." "The quiet of peace and
tranquility of settled hopes has descended upon us."
July 10, 1919, he announced, "The war ended in November, eight months ago"; and in a message dated October 27, 1919, he declared that war emergencies which might
have called for prohibition "have been satisfied in the
demobilization of the army and navy." Food supplies
were abundant, and there is no pretense that the enactment under consideration was intended to preserve them.
Finally, the statute itself contains no declaration that prohibition of non-intoxicants was regarded as in any way
essential to the proper conduct or conclusion of the war
or to restoration of peace.

McREYNOLDS, DAY, and VAN DEVANTER, JJ., dissenting.

Giving consideration to this state of affairs, I can see no
reasonable relationship between the war declared in 1917,
or the demobilization following (both of which in essence
if not by formal announcement terminated before October,
1919) or restoration of peace (whose quiet had already descended upon us) and destruction of the valup of complainant's beverage, solemnly admitted in this record to
be non-intoxicating and which it manufactured, held and
desired to sell in strict compliance with the laws of New
York. Nor can I discover any substantial ground for
holding that such destruction could probably aid in an
appreciable way the enforcement of any prohibition law
then within the competency of Congress to enact. It is
not enough merely to assert such a probability; it must
arise from the facts.
Moreover, well settled rights of the individual in harmless property and powers carefully reserved to the States,
ought not to be abridged or destroyed by mere argumentation based upon supposed analogies. The Constitution
should be interpreted in view of the spirit which pervades
it and always with a steadfast purpose to give complete
effect to every part according to the true intendmentnone should suffer emasculation by any strained or unnatural construction. And these solemn words we may
neither forget nor ignore--" Nor shall any person .
be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public
use, without just compensation." "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States re-(
spectively, or to the people."
