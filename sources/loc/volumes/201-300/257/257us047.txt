MARINE RAILWAY & COAL COMPANY, INC. v.
UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT OF
COLUMBIA.

No. 45. Argued October 18, 1921.-Decided November 7, 1921.
1. The jurisdiction of this court to review judgments of the Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia "in cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue" (Jud. Code, § 250, cl. 1),
attaches to a case originating in the Supreme Court of the District in which the issue concerned the territorial limits of that
court's jurisdiction. P. 62.
2. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia being a court of
general jurisdiction, there is no occasion to limit the natural scope
of Jud. Code, § 250, cl. 1, after the manner in which the similarly
worded § 238, applicable to the District Courts of the United
States, has been confined to cases in which their jurisdiction as
federal courts is involved. P. 62.
3. A certificate of the question of jurisdiction is not necessary, under
Jud. Code, § 250, supra, where the issue was clearly made by plea
and a certificate could add nothing to the record. P. 62.
4. Quwre: Whether the rule construing the sixth clause of Jud. Code,
§ 250, as conferring jurisdiction only when the law drawn in question is of general application throughout the United States, as distinguished from one local to the District, would apply in a case
involving a statute fixing the boundary of the District. P. 62. Cf.
American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia, 224 U. S.
491.
5. The original title of Maryland, to which the United States suc.
ceeded in the District of Columbia, extended at least to the low
water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. P. Q3.

6. The Maryland title was not affected by later charters granted by
James I to Virginia. P. 63.
7. A grant made by the Governor of Virginia to one Howsing in 1669,
with a boundary "extending down Potomack River by various
courses 3152 po. making a S. Wtly line to a pokecory," etc., and
" including several small creeks or inlets," held consistent with as
well as subordinate to the Maryland grant, merely following the
line of the stream and not intended to include an indentation or
cove. P. 63.
8. The grant made by Virginia to the United States of territory
formerly included in the District of Columbia and its re-grant by
the United States did not enlarge Virginia's rights as they were
originally. P. 63.
9. The compact entered into between Virginia and Maryland, in
1785, to regulate commerce, which provided, inter alia, that the
Potomac should be a common highway for purposes of navigation
and commerce to the citizens of both States and gave the citizens
of each full property in the shores of the river adjoining their
lands with wharfing and fishing rights, did not settle the question
of boundary between the States. P. 63.
10. The arbitration of boundary between Virginia and Maryland, the
award in which was accepted by those States in 1878 and assented
to by the United States (Act of March 3, 1879, c. 196, 20 Stat.
481,) fixing the line at low water mark on the Virginia side of the
Potomac drawn from headland to headland, did not involve or
affect the boundary as between Virginia and the District of Columbia. P. 64.
11. The filling in and adverse occupation of land originally below low
water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac under an erroneous
claim that the Virginia line included a cove in which the land was
situated by extending from headland to headland, gave no prescriptive right, as against Maryland or the United States, to land lying
in the cove, and below low water next to the areas so filled, even
though the claim was supported by Virginia statutes. P. 65.
12. The description of the District of Columbia in the Revised
Statutes relating thereto, June 22, 1874, § 1, as "including the
river Potomac in its course through the District," imports an assertion by Congress that the title of the United States embraces the
whole river; and the jurisdiction of the District over the river
seems to have been exercised without dispute. P. 65.

Mr. James R. Caton for plaintiff in error.
In Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1, 517, this
court recognized that the arbitration and award established the boundary line between Virginia and Maryland,
to be the true boundary line between said States, agree-,
ably to the Compact of 1785. And see Wharton v. Wise,
153 U. S. 155, 172, 173.
The claim of the plaintiff in error not being founded on
the Culpeper grant, is distinguished from Morris v.
United States, 174 U. S. 196. There was no evidence in
that case of any substantial claim by Lord Fairfax, or by
his grantees, to property rights in the Potomac River or
the soil thereunder; nor was there any evidence that Virginia ever exercised the power to grant ownership in the
islands or soil under the river to private persons. In this
case, the Howsing grant of 1669, and its history, show that
Virginia claimed the right and exercised the power, and
has for 243 years, and up to the time of this suit, consistently and continuously claimed and exercised territorial dominion and jurisdiction.
The true boundary between Maryland and Virginia in
1785, and for a long time prior thereto, on the Virginia
side of the Potomac, was a uniform line at low-water
mark from one headland to low-water mark at another,

without following indentations, bays, creeks, etc.; and to
this line Virginia had become entitled as early as 1785 by
prescriptive right, and it was fixed and established by the
Compact of 1785, all of which appears from the report
and award of the arbitrators selected under agreement by
Maryland and Virginia, and the subsequent acceptance
thereof by the acts of assembly of both States and the
consent thereto by Congress.
The grants by James I to Virginia do not appear to
have been in evidence, or even considered, in Morris v.
United States, supra. Out of these conflicting grants
there arose a lengthy controversy between Maryland and
Virginia,-Maryland claiming by virtue of the charter of
Charles I to Lord Baltimore the whole of the Potomac to
high-water mark on the Virginia side, and Virginia claiming by virtue of the charters of James I and by prescription to high-water on the Maryland side, Virginia insisting that the boundaries of the territory under the grant
to Lord Baltimore extended only to high-water mark on
the Maryland side. During the 150 years or more this
controversy continued, Virginia always asserted territorial
jurisdiction, ownership and possession of the shores or
strands on the Virginia side, which is evidenced by the
grant of land to include the soil under the waters on the
Virginia side of the river to Howsing, in 1669, which was
prior to the grant, of James I, in 1688, to Lord Culpeper.
See Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1, 45; s. c. 217
U. S. 577-581.
The Act of Congress of 1874, defining the political
boundaries of the District of Columbia, does not alter the
boundary line between Virginia and the District, as set
forth in the arbitration and award of 1878; according to
the true interpretation of the act, it serves only to confirm
the contention of plaintiff in error.
Although that act is a political declaration of the
boundaries of the District, yet, when the United States

comes into a court of law and sues to recover the fee of a
parcel of land claimed by it to be within the boundaries
of the District, and that fact is put in issue by plea to the
jurisdiction, it is bound to establish that fact, and the case
must be tried on the law and the facts of the case.
Battery Cove, which includes the land in controversy, is
no part of the course or of the navigable body of the river.
In the Howsing grant it is expressly stated that the line
is a southwesterly line from Alexander's Island to Jones'
Point, which is a straight line. The presumption is that
a line between monuments is a straight one. This is not
overcome by the fact that monuments are at points on
the same river. Slade v. Etheridge, 13 Ired. Law, 553.
The Howsing grant, the legislation of the Colony and
State of Virginia, from 1753 to 1789, and from 1846 to
1912, the making of land by Virginia and her citizens into
the Potomac all along the Alexandria river front, covering a distance of two blocks east of the shore line of 1748,
making 14 city blocks and including streets containing an
area bf about 35 acres, sustain the prescriptive claim of
territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction in Virginia.
Possession under the Howsing grant of a part of the
land comprehended within its boundaries, constitutes possession of the whole; especially is this true where acts of
possession and claim of ownership under the grant, and
the exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction by the State
and city, have continued for so long a period. Taxes have
been imposed and collected thereon by both Virginia and
Alexandria during all that period, except between the cession and recession of the Virginia territory. All titles to
property within the lines of the Howsing grant in Alexandria City and County, including Alexander's Island and
Pearson's Island, and to the made lands on the Alexandria
river front, are recorded in Virginia. Jackson v. Camp, 1
Cowp. 605, 612. This constructive possession has its
origin in the maxim of the common law that "possession

Sovereignties may lose territory by prescription as individuals may lose their title by adverse possession. Rhode
Island v. Massachusetts,4 How. 591, 639; Vattel, Law of
Nations, bk. 2, c. 11, § 149. The constant and approved
practice of nations shows that, by whatever name it be
called, the uninterrupted possession of territory for a certain length of time by one State excludes the claim of
every other. Wheaton, Int. Law, pt. 2, c. 14, § 164; Indianav. Kentucky, 136 U. S.479; Virginiav. Tennessee,
148 U. S. 503, 523, 524; Maryland v. West Virginia, 217
U. S.1, 577, 585; Phillipsv. Payne, 92 U. S.130.
The Act of Congress of June 25, 1910, read with related
legislative documents, clearly recognizes the territorial
rights and jurisdiction of Virginia over the whole line of
the authorized improvement along the Alexandria river
front from Jones' Point to the northern corporate limits
of said city.
If the contention that the original line of the Calvert
grant of 1632 is the present boundary between the District
and Alexandria were upheld, it would cut off Alexandria
entirely from the river and place in the District all the
land made in the coves prior to 1785, covering a large
number of city blocks, and would disturb the title of their
owners.
Whilst Alexandria was a part of the District of Columbia, Congress preserved the integrity of the territorial and
jurisdictional limits of Alexandria, and since the recession
neither the United States nor the District has made any
claim to the territory within these lines or exercised any
act of jurisdiction over the same during the 67 years previous to the time Battery Cove was filled.

There is no evidence showing that either Maryland or
the United States ever made any claim to Alexander's
Island or Pearson's Island, or any of the bays, creeks or
inlets, included in the Howsing grant.
The Compact of 1785 was a complete and binding
agreement between Maryland and Virginia, and their respective territorial rights thereunder had become fixed
before the formation of the Federal Government and the
adoption of the Federal Constitution. Wharton v. Wise,
153 U. S. 155, 166; Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503,

The compact confirmed the territorial ownership and
jurisdiction of Virginia. The acts of cession of these
States did not modify the compact in so far as it fixed
the territorial boundaries and jurisdiction of Virginia.

The United States did not acquire title to or jurisdiction over the filled area because of the fact that in the
improvement of the river and harbor it made and reclaimed the land. Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Illinois,

By the act of Congress approving and consenting to
the agreement and award, the United States became a
party thereto as fully and as effectually as if it had been
a party at the very inception of the agreement to submit
to arbitration. Wharton v. Wise, 153 U. S. 155, 172, 173;
Virginia v. Tennessee, 148 U. S. 503, 521. The reservation in the act consenting to the arbitration and award, of
jurisdiction over the waters and islands, referred only to
the powers of Congress over the waters and islands under
the commerce clause qf the Constitution. The reservation does not relate to territorial or property rights, but
to jurisdiction only.
Mr. Henry H. Glassie, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Frierson and
Mr. Leslie C. Garnett, Special Assistant to the Attorney
General, were on the brief, for the United States.
The United States, as successor to the lord proprietary
of Maryland and as complete territorial sovereign of the
District of Columbia,*has not only the dominion but the
absolute property of the soil of the Potomac River. Any
land, therefore, raised upon the submerged bed in the
course of a lawful public improvement, is owned in absolute property by the United States. Hale, De Jure Mars,
c. 6; Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, 48; Austin v. Rutland R. R. Co., 45 Vt. 215, 244; Hoboken v. Pennsylvania

It is settled that the Maryland Charter of 1632 embraced the Potomac River and the soil under it to highwater mark on the Virginia bank. Morris v. United

States, 174 U. S. 196, 225; Alexandria Canal Co. v. District of Columbia, 1 Mackey, 257. It is true that the
Marshall claim rejected in the Morris Case was based
upon the Culpeper grant of 1688, whereas the claim here
is based on the Howsing grant of 1669. But the Culpeper
grant was a confirmation of the original grant to Hopton
of September 18, 1649, confirmed to his successors on
May 8, 1669 (4 Hen. Stat. Va., c. XVIII, pp. 514, 519).
In holding that the Maryland title was "not affected by
the subsequent grant to Culpeper" the court held in
effect that it was superior to the original Hopton grant
which was itself senior to Howsing.
The Howsing grant embraced no part of the Potomac
River: (a) Because it was an ordinary conveyance, under
a general system for the disposition of unappropriated
lands, which even by Virginia law carried no soil under
public tidal waters. Home v. Richards, 4 Call (Va.) 441,
446, 447; Mann v. Tacoma Land Co., 153 U. S. 273, 284.
(b) Because, the Governor of Virginia being without
power to enlarge the political boundaries of the colony,
the grant must be construed as confined to land in Virginia (c) Because the description, beginning on land and
"extending down the Potomack River various courses
3152 poles," does not call for straight lines in the river.
Brown v. Huger, 21 How. 305, 320; Hardinv. Jordan,140
U. S. 371, 380; Smith v. Aldridge, 2 Hayw. 382; Rogers v.
Mabe, 15 N. Car. 180, 184. The river being public, the
grant stops at the water's edge, notwithstanding the
words "including several small creekes or inlets for the
said quantity." The last expression means only that the
quantity had been measured approximately without allowance for small water areas within the tract.
While some so-called islands now forming part of the

of the grantees. Constructive adverse possession under
color of title-itself a mere legal fiction, Carey v. Cagney,

Inloes, 1 Gill. 497, 500. In the absence of occupancy, the
seizin remains in him who has the title. Hunnicutt v.
Peyton, 102 U. S. 333, 368. The Maryland proprietary
was not bbund to notice domestic conveyances in Virginia.
Nor would possession of upland under such conveyances
indicate that the patentees claimed soil under the river,
patentable neither in Virginia nor in Maryland.
The Maryland-Virginia Compact of 1785 was without
effect on the Potomac boundary.
The purpose was not to change the charter line but to
make provision for the concurrent use and police of the
waters. Proc. Md. Cony. 1774-1776, pp. 291, 293. Attorney General v. Del. & B. B. R. R. Co., 27 N. J. Eq. 1, 121;

The shore and wharf rights allowed the Virginia upland

No reason exists for giving the compact the effect suggested. Shore lines are physical, not imaginary lines. A
boundary from headland to headland is highly inconvenient in practice and inconsistent with dominion of the
river, as such, which unquestionably belonged to Maryland. Hall, Int. Law, 7th ed., p. 125; 1 Moore, Int.

Lib. II, c. 3.
Construing the compact as a treaty between two sovereign States (Howardv. Ingersoll,13 How. 381, 412), the
privileges in the waters and adjacent shores are no more
than a recognition of servitudes in the stream generally
allowed ih favor of the subjects of the opposite sovereign.
The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, 369; Wheaton, Int. Law, §§
193, 194; Kaeckenbeck, International Rivers, 15, 34, 74,

The arbitration award of 1877, being limited to the
boundary between Virginia and Maryland, was without
effect on the Virginia-District of Columbia boundary.
Nor did the Act of March 2, 1879, 20 Stat. 481, giving
the consent of Congress to the award, make it applicable
to the Virginia-District of Columbia boundary, notwithstanding the proviso, inserted out of abundant caution,
that nothing therein contained should impair or affect
any right or jurisdiction of the United States over the
islands and waters forming the subject of sucha award.
In re Devoe Manufacturing Co., 108 U. S. 401, 415.
Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1, 577, is not an
authority on the Potomac boundary. The real question
there was the western, not the river boundary. The
court's attention was not directed to the question of high
or low water mark. The suggestion in the supplementary
opinion (217 U. S. 580) that the privileges on the shores
were inconsistent 'with the charter boundary was
grounded on a tacit concession, for Maryland after the
award of 1877 had never pressed a claim to high water
mark The expression of opinion is not binding. The
Genessee Chief, 12 How. 443, 455.
The h adland to headland theory has no possible application to an interstate river boundary. It is not recognized by the United States as ageneral principle even in

headland to headland only when they mark the entrance
to a landlocked estuary or bay. 1 Moore, Int. Law Dig.,

States, 32 Alb. Law Journ. 484; 4 Moore, Int. Arb.
4332-41. The present points claimed as headlands cannot be taken because they have been artificially created.
The old, obliterated points some distance inland cannot be
taken because, if ever headlands, they are such no longer.
A headland call requires a definite, permanent, visible
object. The claim for a headland line is an attempt to
apply the Maryland-Virginia arbitration line of 1877,
reached upon the erroneous assumption that boundary is
determined by the extent of the wharfing privileges.
Domestic statutes of Virginia authorizing extensions of
Alexandria into the river do not make a new interstate
boundary. Acquiescence cannot be inferred from Maryland's failure, during the Revolutionary period, to prevent such fillings. The land so made may be treated as
an accomplished fact. Indiana v. Kentucky, 136 U. S.
479, 510. But failure to prevent by force particular encroachments cannot be treated, in the face of Maryland's
denial, as an acknowledgment of a general right to make
them. It is the fact of occupancy, not the claim, which
works the change. Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U. S. 158,
172. Between 1791 and 1847 the United States was sovereign of both shores, and changes in the water front then
made cannot affect the question because there was then
no boundary to affect. Virginia statutes passed after the
retrocession are merely paper claims of jurisdiction not
acquiesced in by the United States. Congress, on the
contrary, has expressly defined the District, and governed
it, as the territory ceded by Maryland, "including the
river Potomac in its course through the District, and the
islands therein." Rev. Stats. D. C. § 1. In such a conflict the legal title must prevail. United States v. Texas,

Virginia has not shown such long continued possession
of, or exercise of dominion over, the disputed area as
would be equivalent to the relocation of a common boundary line by acquiescence. Calls of private conveyances
for lines running "into the river," etc., do not constitute
adverse occupation of the bed of a public river. The
United States had all the possession of which such soil
was susceptible. Such actual jurisdiction as has been exercised has been in accordance with the Government's
claim: By police of the waters and protection of the

The title of the United States, like the Crown title in

But conceding that defendant's riparian rights were
infringed by the reclamation, that fact would not invest defendant with title to the reclaimed area. An
owner of land having a statutory right to wharf out acquires no title to reclamation on submerged soil in front
of him, even when made by a stranger. Austin v. Rutland R. R. Co., 45 Vt. 215, 242; Coburn v. Ames, 52 Cal.
385, 398. Much less, when made by the sovereign itself.
No economic reason exists for giving the reclaimed soil to
the upland owner even if wrongfully deprived of access,
since reclaimed soil is not a proper measure of compensation. The shore land having the least valuable riparian
rights would, in that event, acquire the major portion of
the reclamation.
MR. JusTicE HoLMEs delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit brought by the United States in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to recover possession of a strip of land on the Potomac River front of
the City of Alexandria. Except an insignificant portion
as fo which no special defence was made and which it is
agreed may be disregarded, this strip lay below low water
mark until it was filled in by the United States in 19101912 by dredging from the bottom of the river and depositing the material on the other side of a riprap wall
built on the river bed. Act of June 25, 1910, c. 382, 36
Stat. 630, 639. Act of February 27, 1911, c. 166, 36 Stat.
933, 937. The United States enclosed the made land by
a fence at high water mark, but the defendant, the plaintiff in error, claiming title to the adjoining land inshore,
destroyed the fence and took possession, whereupon this

action was brought. The defendant pleaded to the jurisdiction of the Court alleging that the land was not in the
District but was part of Virginia. On this issue the Court
found or ruled in favor of the plaintiff and afterwards did
the same upon the general issue, a jury having been
waived. Judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the
Court of Appeals and the defendant took a writ of error
to bring the case to this Court.
A question is raised by the defendant in error as to the
jurisdiction of this Court. The language of the Judicial
Code, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, § 250, 36 Stat. 1087,
1159, is that any final judgment of the Court of Appeals
may be reexamined "First. In cases in which the jurisdiction of the trial court is in issue." The words taken
literally cover this case, but it is argued that they should
be construed as similar words in § 238 concerning the District Courts are construed. In the latter instance, as is
well known, they are confined to the jurisdiction of the
District Courts as courts of the United States. But the
jurisdiction of the District Courts is a limited jurisdiction
based upon statutory grounds, and therefore the words
of § 238 naturally enough were confined to what always
is the first question in a case before them. The Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia on the other hand is a
court of general jurisdiction, and whether or not the
clause of §250 was suggested by the earlier one, we see no
sufficient justification for denying to it the scope that it
must have if it is given its natural sense. The plea to
the jurisdiction raises the question clearly, and a certificate would add nothing to what the record shows.
We are not prepared to say that the judgment before
us was not "otherwise reviewable" on the question of
the boundary between the United States and Virginia, so
far as the defendant drew in question the construction of
the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia,
§ 1, June 22, 1874, hereafter discussed. We should hesi-

tate to apply the decision in American Security & Trust
Co.v. District of Columbia, 224 U. S.491, to such a case.
The question of the jurisdiction of the trial Court and
that of the merits very nearly coalesce, as the original
title, at least, of Maryland and its jurisdiction were
founded upon the same facts, and as the United States
succeeded to the rights of Maryland by the grant of the
District completed in 1791. That the original title of
Maryland extended at least to low water mark on the
Virginia side it now is too late to deny, in view of the
decisions in Maryland v. West Virginia, 217 U. S. 1, 45,
46; s.c. ibid. 577, 578; and Morris v. United States, 174
U. S. 196. An attempt to throw doubt upon these authorities and upon the effect of the charter of Charles I,
June 20, 1632, granting Maryland to Lord Baltimore
(ad ulteriorem dicti Fluminis Ripam et earn sequendo
&c., 217 U. S. 25) "to the farther bank of the said
[Potomac] river and following it," by the charters of
James I to Virginia and especially by the terms of a
grant from the Governor of Virginia to Howsing in 1669
must fail. The latter grant is subordinate to the former
and is not inconsistent with it as the language is "extending down Potomack River by various courses 3152.po.
making a S. Wtly line to a pokecory" &c. The implication of the words "by various courses" that the grant
follows the line of the stream is not changed by the words
"including several small cfeeks or inlets." The land in
question is situated upon an indentation, called Battery
Cove, but the place is not a creek or inlet. The former
decisions of the Court must be followed so far as they go.
The original state of things was not changed by the
grant of Virginia and the regrant by the United States of
the part of the District on the Virginia side. They at
least did not enlarge the rights of that State. The compact between Virginia and Maryland in 1785 also seems
to us to have no bearing upon the uase. It says nothing

about the boundary in terms. Without going into the
history of the compact or reciting it, we only need to
remark that it was a regulation of commerce, and while
with a view to opening up a route to the West it provided
in Article 6 that the Potomac should be considered as a
common highway for the purposes of navigation and commerce to the citizens of Virginia and Maryland, -and in
Article 7 gave the citizens of each State full property in
the shores of the river adjoining their lands and the
privilege of carrying out wharves, &c., with a common
right of fishing, it left the question of boundary open to
long continued disputes. It may be laid on one side
even if it ever was in force in the District of Columbia,
which has been denied on the ground that the compact
was abrogated so far as it affected this land by the grant
of Virginia and was not revived by the grant of the
United States. Evans v. United States, 31 App. D. C.
544, 550. See Georgetown v. Alexandria Canal Co., 12
Pet. 91.
The question 'of boundary remaining open was submitted to arbitration which ended in an award accepted
by the parties in 1878. But that was an arbitration between the two States and did not purport to affect the
boundary of the District. The assent of the United States
did not enlarge its scope. Act of March 3, 1879, c. 196, 20
Stat. 481. It is said that as the submission was to an
ascertainment of the true boundary line the award must
be taken to have determined it, but the question was confined to the boundary between the States as they then
were, and whatever may be the force of the argument that
the same principle ought to govern here, it was not and
could not be adjudicated. Further discussion on this
point is not needed. The award fixed low water mark on
the Virginia side as the boundary, and is only material
if at all as suggesting a claim that the low water line
should'be drawn from headland to headland and in that

way include the indentation or cove where the United
States has filled. But we know of no reason for construing the charter to Lord Baltimore as so limited or
that to Howsing as importing such a rule.
The only important aspect of the last mentioned suggestion is in connection with a claim of prescriptive right.
The land behind the filling of the United States is made
land, and the fillings on the Alexandria side go below the
original low water mark. In this case, however, there is
no attempt to disturb the long maintained possession of
such extensions whether originally warranted or not.
The only question before us is of the rights of the United
States to fill land that hitherto has been under water.
The plaintiff in error seeks to exclude it by force of what
already has been done and the claims of right that have
been made in connection with it. If the taking possession
of land were under a deed purporting to convey more
than the portion actually occupied, no doubt, within
reasonable limits, the sovereign power might give to it
the effect of adverse possession of the whole, as against
other subjects of the same power. Montoya v. Gonzales,
232 U. S. 375, 377, 378. But the effect of filling in upon
the edge of a stream as against a different power is another matter. Such acts in themselves import no claim
beyond the land thus occupied. Maryland and the United
States are not called upon to scrutinize the discourse of
those in Virginia even if in statutory form. Except so far
as actually occupied the seizin of the land remains in the
party that has the title. "One who enters upon the land
of another, though under color of title, gives no notice to
that other of any claim, except to the extent of his actual
occupancy." Hunnicutt v. Peyton, 102 U. S. 333, 369.
Still more is this true as against independent sovereign
rights.
Finally, on the other hand, the Revised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia, June 22, 1874, § 1, de-

scribe the District as "including the river Potomac in
its course through the District," which imports an assertion by Congress that the title of the United States embraces the whole river bed; and the jurisdiction of the
District over the river seems to have been exercised without dispute. For cases that have reached the reports see

Columbia, 23 App. D. C. 266. Evans v. United States,

It may happen that such filling as is done in this case
will interrupt previously existing access to the water front.
But that does not affect the right of the United States to
possession of the land. What other rights, if any, the
plaintiff in error may have does not concerAt us now.
