about one-third of the hardwood lumber of the country.
This court held in United States v. United States Steel
Corporation,251 U. S. 417, that it was not unlawful to
vest in a single corporation control of 50 per cent. of the
steel industry of the country; and in United States v.
United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U. S. 32, the court held
that it was not unlawful to vest in a single corporation
control of practically the whole shoe machinery industry.
May not these hardwood lumber concerns, frustrated in
their efforts to rationalize competition, be led to enter the
inviting field of consolidation? And if they do, may not
another huge trust with highly centralized control over
vast resources, natural, manufacturing and financial, become so powerful as to dominate competitors, wholesalers,
retailers, consumers, employees and, in large measure, the
community?

and employed by it in public and government purposes. P. 431.
2. Held, that a vessel owned by the United States, assigned by the
United States Shipping Board to the War Department, manned
by a navy crew and engaged in transporting foodstuffs provided
by the Government for the relief of the civilian population of
Europe after the Great War, to be paid for by the buyer, was
not a merchant vessel but a vessel engaged in a public service;
and that two others, while let or chartered to.the United States
on a bare-boat basis and devoted to military and naval uses were
also of public status. P. 431.
1 Pertinent parts of the statutes above mentioned are as follows:
C. 4 1, § 9, 39 Stat. 780. "That any vessel purchased, chartered,
or leased from the [United States Shipping] board may be registered
or enrolled and licensed, or both registered and enrolled and licensed,
as a vessel of the United States and entitled to the benefits and
privileges appertaining thereto.
"Every vessel purchased, chartered, or leased from the board
shall, unless otherwise authorized by the board, be operated only
under such registry or enrollment and license. Such vessels while
employed solely as merchant vessels shall be subject to all laws,
regulations, and liabilities governing merchant vessels, whether the
United States be interested therein as owner, in whole or in part,
or hold any mortgage, lien, or other interest therein. No such vessel,
without the approval of the board, shall be transferred to a foreign
registry or flag, or sold; nor, except under regulations prescribed by
"
the board, be chartered or leased.
C. 95, § 4, 41 Stat. 525, 526. "That if a privately owned vessel
not in the possession of the United States or of such [United
States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet] corporation is arrested or
attached upon any cause of action arising or alleged to have arisen
from previous possession, ownership, or operation of such vessel by
the United States or by such corporation, such vessel shall be released
without bond or stipulation therefor upon the suggestion by the
United States, through its Attorney General or other duly authorized
law officer, that it is interested in such cause, desires such release,
and assumes the liability for the satisfaction of any decree obtained
by the libelant in such cause, and thereafter such cause shall proceed
against the United States in accordance with the provisions of this
Act."

3. The maritime law is part of the law of the country only in so
far as the United States has made it so, and binds the United States
only in so far as the United States has consented. P. 432.
4. The United States has not consented to be sued for torts and
therefore it cannot be. said that, in a legal sense, the United States
has been guilty of a tort. P. 433.
5. This immunity extends to public vessels of the United States, at
least while employed in operations of government; and liability
for a tort cannot be fastened upon them by the fiction of a ship's
personality, to lie dormant while they remain with the Government
and to become enforceable when they pass into other hands.

Attorney General Ottinger and Mr. J. Frank Staley,

The vessels were all of distinctively public status when
the collisions occurred.
Section 9 of the Shipping Act has not waived the immunity of the United States or its vessels from suits in
rem for losses arising while they are employed in the war
service. Both the collision loss and the enforcement of
the claim against the vessel must occur while the government vessel is employed solely as a merchant vessel, and
then is operating for the account of others than the Government, under charter or lease.

claimant for the vessel and substitutes its credit for the
payment of the decree finally entered, if any, instead of
the usual bond or stipulation for value otherwise entered
to secure the release. of a vessel from attachment. The
proceedings continue as proceedings in rem. Manifestly,
if the libel does not state a cause of action, in rem against
the vessel, this section can not create one.
Unless there is some magic in such public vessels' personification, the Government can not be held for these
torts. There is no distinction between the Government
and its property. There should be no relief by indirection
where Congress has not provided relief directly. Bigby
v. United States, 188 U. S. 400, 408; Langford v. United
States, 101 U. S. 341, 344; Gibbons v. United States, 8
Wall. 269, 274. Public vessels are part of the sovereign
State and their liabilities are merged in those of the
sovereign. United States v. Ansonia Brass Co., 218 U. S.

The law merchant personified the commercial ship not
a public ship. Commercial vessels are sent in trade to
all ports. Their owners are usually inaccessible for purposes of suit, and their personal responsibilities are uncertain. The necessities of the vessel's operation in merchant
service demand that the vessel, the res, shall be responsible for her torts and contracts. The basis of the law
governing merchant vessels is aid of commerce. Vandewater v. Mills, 19 How. 82; United States v. Brig Maek

The Western Maid was a merchant vessel at the time
of the collision. The sale of foodstuffs to enemy aliens
is not a necessary function of the sovereign. Indeed, the
Act of February 25, 1919, 40 Stat. 1161, indicates the
opinion of Congress that it was unwise for the Government to engage in trade with enemy populations. It is
doubtful whether it is constitutional for the Government
to engage in transporting foodstuffs to be offered for sale
at destination. United States v. Strang, 254 U. S. 491;
United States Shipping Board v. Wood, 274 Fed. 893.
The collision took place two months after the armistice
Under such circumstances, the vessel could in no event be
called a vessel engaged in a military operation. The
Government has the burden of proof to establish that she
was a public vessel engaged in a military operation. Ex

record shows that she was registered as a merchant ship;
and it is to be inferred that she was operating under this
registry. Rev. Stats. §§ 4170, 4171; Navigation Laws
of the United States, 1919, p. 41.
Congress, by the Suits in Admiralty Act of 1920, has
waived immunity as to merchant vessels. In effect this
is a suit under that act.
If we assume that the Western Maid was a public vessel at the time of the collision, nevertheless a claim in
favor of the libelant was created against her at that time,
which could be enforced in rem. The Siren, 7 Wall. 152;
13 Wall. 389. The Government contends that the language in 7 Wall. 155, 156, 158, is a dictum. When the
members of this court, in face of a single dissent, make
a doctrine one of the principle, grounds for the court's
decision, such a doctrine can hardly be called a dictum.
The Government suggests that, because the Siren was a
prize, the case is distinguishable. This conclusion does
not follow. See Lord, Admiralty Claims, 19 Col. Law
Rev. 477.
As we view the case, The Siren was a decision directly
in point. The proposition relied upon by Mr. Justice
Nelson as a ground for his dissent (7 Wall. 165), viz, that,
if an owner of an offending vessel is not liable, it follows
that there can be no lien, is contrary to the decisions in

15; The Carlo Poma, 259 Fed. 369. But even in England it is settled, as was said in Workman v. New York
City, 179 U. S. 552, that a collision impresses a liability
on a public vessel which becomes enforcible when the
crown waives the immunity of the public vessel. The

In Ex parte New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490, this court
said that the Workman Case dealt with a question of the
substanive law of admiralty, not the power to exercise

The officers in command of The Carolinian when this
collision occurred, while imposed upon the ship by the
authority of the Government under the Act of June 15,
1917, occupied no different position from the compulsory
pilot imposed upon The China. (7 Wall. 53.) The John

The decisions show that in order to sustain a suit in rem
for collision only two conditions need exist: (1) Fault on
the part of the navigators, and (2) the ability of the court
to execute its process by seizure.
The attributes of sovereignty do not inure to the benefit
of private individuals. Moran v. Horsky, 178 U. S. 205.
That a national war vessel may be held in fault for a
collision due to the negligence of her officers and crew was
directly decided in The Sapphire, 11 Wall. 164.
Even if, at the time of the collision, The Carolinian had
been owned by the United States, an inchoate lien would
nevertheless have been created which could be enforced
in the present suit. The FlorenceH, 248 Fed. 1012; The

The only basis on which the exemption of government
property from such a lien can be rested is the medixval
doctrine of "prerogative," which forms no part of our
jurisprudence. DollarSavings Bank v. United States, 19
Wall. 227; United States v. Wilder, supra.
Nor is there any principle of public policy which prevents the creation of a maritime lien against a public vessel owned by the United States. When the privately
owned vessel is at fault, the United States collects its
damages from the ship or her owners, and it is only fair

Opinion of the Court.

that a private owner should -have a like right when the
government ship is to blame. Congress has recognized
this principle of equality by making the statutory rules
for preventing collisions at sea binding upon public ships
as well as private, 26 Stat. 320; 28 Stat. 645; 2 Fed. Stat.
Ann., 2d ed., 376, 402, 449. If a merchant ship and a
war ship are equally at fault, the damages are divided.
The Sapphire, supra.
The justice of paying claims arising out of collisions for
which public vessels were at fault has always been recognized by Congress through many special acts allowing
claims.
The doctrine of the immunity of the sovereign from
suit-to which so many exceptions have been made by
statute as almost do away with the rule-is based not
upon principle but upon precedent. United States v.
Lee, 106 U. S. 196, 206; United States v. tmery Bird
Thayer Realty Co., 237 U. S. 28, 32. This is evidenced
by the practical relief from it in collision cases afforded
in England, France, Germany, and in the State of New
York.
The Act of March 9, 1920, is an express recognition by
Congress that a maritime lien may exist against a public
vessel even though used solely for governmental purposes,
and as the United States has secured the release of The
Carolinian under this act it cannot now contend that the
court is without jurisdiction.
MR. JusTim

HOLms delivered the opinion of the court.

These are petitions for prohibition to prevent District
Courts of the United States from exercising jurisdiction of
proceedings in rem for collisions that occurred while the
vessels libeled were owned, absolutely or pro hac vice, by
the United States, and employed in the public service.
The questions arising in the three cases are so nearly the
same that they can be dealt with together.

The Western Maid was and is the property of the
United States. On January 10. 1919, she was allocated by
the United States Shipping Board to the War Department
for service as a transport.
She had been loaded with
foodstuffs for the relief of the civilian population of
Europe, to be delivered on arrival at Falmouth, England,
to the order of the Food Administration Grain Corporation, the consignor, American Embassy, London, care of
the Chief Quartermaster, American Expeditionary Forces,
France; subject to the direction of Mr. Hoover. If it
should prove impracticable to reship or redirect to the
territories lately held by the Central Empires, Mr.
Hoover was to resell to the Allied Governments or to the
Belgian Relief; the foodstuffs to be paid for by the buyer.
The vessel was manned by a navy crew. Later on the same
day, January 10, 1919, in New York harbor, the collision
occurred. On March 20, 1919, the vessel was delivered
to the United States Shipping Board. The libel was filed
on November 8, 1919. Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451,
§ 9, 39 Stat. 728, 730. The Lake Monroe, 250 U. S. 246.
On February 20, 1920, the Government moved that it be
dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The District Court
overruled the motion. On April 11, 1921, the Attorney
General moved for leave to file the present petition in
this Court. Leave was granted and the case has been
heard.
The Liberty was a pilot boat let to the United States
on the bare-boat basis at a nominal rate of hire. She had
been manned by a crew from the United States Navy and
commissioned as a naval dispatch boat, and was employed
to serve military needs in war service. The collision took
place on December 24, 1917, while she was so employed, in
Boston Harbor. Afterwards the vessel was redelivered to
the owners and still later, on February 5, 1921, the suit
now in question was brought against her. On February
14, under the Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95, § 4, 41 Stat. 525,

Opinion of the Court.

the United States filed a suggestion of its interest, and also
set up the above facts. The District Court held that they
constituted no defence and this petition was brought by
the Attorney General along with that last mentioned.
The Steamship Carolinian had been chartered to the
United States upon a bare-boat charter and had been assigned to the War Department, by which she was employed as an army transport and furnished with an army
crew. While she was so employed the collision took place
in the harbor of Brest, France, on February 15, 1918.
Afterwards the Carolinian was returned to the owners,
and she was employed solely as a merchant -essel on
July 9, 1920, when the suit in question was begun, under
which the vessel was seized. In the same month the
United States filed a suggestion of interest, and on January 6, 1921, set up the foregoing facts and prayed that
the libel be dismissed. The District Court maintained its
jurisdiction and this petition was brought by the Attorney General along with the other two. 270 Fed. 1011.
It may be assumed that each of these vessels might
have been libeled for maritime torts committed after the
redelivery that we have mentioned. But the Act of September 7, 1916, c. 451, § 9, does not create a liability on
the part of the United States, retrospectively, where one
did not exist before. Neither, in our opinion, is such a
liability created by the Act of March 9, 1920, c. 95, § 4,
authorizing the United States to assume the defence in
suits like these. It is not required to abandon any defence that otherwise would be good. It appears to us
plain that before the passage of these acts neither the
United States nor the vessels in the hands of the United
States were liable to be sued for these alleged maritime
torts. The Liberty and the Carolinian were employed
for public and government purposes, and were owned pro
hac vice by the United States. It is suggested that the
Western Maid was a merchant vessel at the time of the

collision, but the fact that the food was to be paid for
and the other details adverted to in argument cannot disguise the obvious truth, that she was engaged in a public
service that was one of the constituents of our activity in
the war and its sequel and that had no more to do with
ordinary merchandizing than if she had carried a regiment of troops. The only question really open to debate
is whether a liability attached to the ships which although
dormant while the United States was in possession became enforcible as soon as the vessels came into hands
that could be sued.
In deciding this question we must realize that however
ancient may be the traditions of maritime law, -however
diverse the sources from which it has been drawn, it derives its whole and only power in this country from its
having been accepted and adopted by the United States.
There is no mystic over-law to which even the United
States must bow. When a case is said to be governed by
foreign law or by general maritime law that is only a
short way of saying that for this purpose the sovereign
power takes up a rule suggested from without and makes
it part of its own rules. The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558,
571, 572. Dalrymple v. Dalrymple, 2 Hagg. Cons. 54, 58,
59. Dicey, Conflict of Laws, 2d ed., 6, 7. Also we must
realize that the authority that makes the law is itself
superior to it, and that if it consents to apply to itself the
rules that it applies to others the consent is free and may
be withheld. The sovereign does not create justice in an
ethical sense, to be sure, and there may be cases in which
it would not dare to deny that justice for fear of war or
revolution. Sovereignty is a question of power, and no
human power is unlimited. Carifo v. Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, 212 U. S. 449, 458. But
from the necessary point of view of the sovereign and its
organs whatever is enforced by it as law is enforced as the

expression of its will. Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205
U. S. 349, 353.
The United States has not consented to be sued for
torts, and therefore it cannot be said that in a legal sense
the United States has been guilty of a tort. For a tort is
a tort in a legal sense only because the law has made it so.
If then we imagine the sovereign power announcing the
system of its laws in a single voice it is hard to conceive
it as declaring that while it does not recognize the possibility of its acts being a legal wrong and while its immunity from such an imputation of course extends to its
property, at least when employed in carrying on the operations of the Government,--specifically appropriated to
national objects, in the language of Buchanan v. Alexander, 4 How. 20,--yet if that property passes into other
hands, perhaps of an innocent purchaser, it may be seized
upon a claim that had no existence before. It may be said
that the persons who actually did the act complained of
may or might be sued and that the ship for this purpose
is regarded as a person. But that is a fiction not a fact
and as a fiction is the creation of the law. It would be a
a strange thing if the law created a fiction to accomplish
the result supposed. It is totally immaterial that in dealing with private wrongs the fiction, however originated,
is in force. See Liverpool, Brazil & River Plate Steam
Navigation Co. v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal,
251 U. S. 48, 53. The personality of a public vessel is
merged in that of the sovereign. The Fidelity, 16
Blatchf. 569, 573. Ex parte State of New York, No. 2,
256 U. S. 503.
But it is said that the decisions have recognized that
an obligation is created in the case before us. Legal obligations that exist but cannot be enforced are ghosts that
are seen in the law but that are elusive to the grasp. The
leading authority relied upon is The Siren, 7 Wall. 152.

The ground of that decision-was that when the United
States came into court to enforce a claim it would be assumed to submit to just claims of third persons in respect of the same subject-matter. 7 Wall. 154. Carr v.
United States, 98 U. S. 433, 438. In reaching its result
the Court spoke of such claims as unenforcible liens, but
that was little more than a mode of expressing the consent
of the sovereign power to see full justice done in such
circumstances. It would have been just as effective and
more accurate to speak of the claims as ethical only, but
recognized in the interest of justice when the sovereign
came into court. They were treated in this way by Dr.
Lushington in The Athol, 1 Win. Rob. 374, 382. Further
distinctions have been taken that need not be adverted to
here. There was nothing decided in Workman v. New York
City, 179 U. S. 552, that is contrary to our conclusion,
which, on the other hand, is favored by The Fidelity, 16
Blatchf. 569, 573, and Ex parteState of New York, No. 1,
256 U. S. 490, and Ex parte State of New York, No. 2,
256 U. S. 503. The last cited decisions also show that a
prohibition may be granted in a case like this. See The

The question in the cases is without complexity, and
the means of its solution ready at hand. The question is,
What is the law applicable to colliding vessels and what
remedy is to be applied to the offending one, if there be
an offending one? The question, I venture to say, has
unequivocal answer in a number of decisions of this court
if they be taken at their word. And why should they

not be? That they have masqueraded in a double sense,
cannot be assumed; that they have successively justified
implications adverse to their meaning would be a matter
of wonder.
What then do they express to be the law of colliding
vessels, the assignment of offence, if offence there be, and
how far is it dependent, if at all, upon whether the offender was in public or private service?
The answer may be immediate. This court has kept
steadily in mind that the admiralty jurisprudence of the
country, as adopted by the Constitution, has a distinctive
individuality, and this court has felt the necessity of
keeping its principles in definite integrity, and the remedies intact by which its principles can alone be realized.
The most l5rominent and efficient of its remedies is that
which subjects its instrumentalities, its ships particularly,
to judgment. Personality is assigned to them and they
are considered in pledge to indemnify any damage inflicted through them. They are made offenders and have
the responsibility of offenders, and the remedy is suited
to the purpose. In Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry &
Machine Co., 237 U. S. 303, 306, it is said, Mir. Justice
Hughes delivering the opinion of the court, "The proceeding in rem which is within the exclusive jurisdiction
of admiralty is one essentially against the vessel itself
as the debtor or offending thing,--in which the vessel is
itself 'seized and impleaded as the defendant, and is
judged and sentenced accordingly."'
In The John G. Stevens, 170 U. S.113, 120, the court,
through Mr..Justice Gray, declared, "The foundation of
the rule that collision gives to the party injured a jus in re
in the offending ship is the principle of the maritime law
that the ship, by whomsoever owned or navigated, is considered as herself the wrongdoer, liable for the tort, and
subject to a maritime lien for the damages. This principle, as has been observed by careful text writers on both

436

257 U.S.

sides of the Atlantic, has been more clearly established,
and more fully carried out, in this country than in England. Henry on Admiralty, §75, note; Marsden on Collisions (3d ed.) 93." The case in many ways and by
many oitations fortifies and illustrates the principle.'
The Siren was cited and the fact is pertinent as we
shall presently see. The China, 7 Wall. 53, was also cited
and quoted from. The quotation was repeated in Ralli
v. Troop) 157 U. S. 386, 402, 403, where it is said that the
liability of a vessel is not derived from the authority or
agency of those on board, either under the civil or common law, "but upon a distinct principle of maritime law,
namely, that the vessel, in whosesoever hands she lawfully is, is herself considered as the wrongdoer, liable for
the tort, and subject to a maritime lien for the damages."
In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 438, this court
by Mr. Justice Brown gave graphic representation to the
same principle. He described a ship prior to her launching as "a mere congeries of wood and iron" but after
launching she took on a name, a personality of her own
and had in a sense volition, became competent to contract
and be contracted with, sue and be sued, could have
agents of lher own, was capable of committing a tort and
was pledged to its reparation. Cases were cited, The
Siren among others.
The doctrine thus explicitly announced is denied application in the pending cases and upon what grounds? As
I understand, the contention is that a vessel has not independent guilt, that there must be fault in its owner or

operator, his fault becoming its fault. This has been said,
but it puts out of view her character as bail and that the
innocent victim of the injury she has inflicted shall not
be remitted to the insufficient or evasive responsibility of
persons but shall have the security. of the tangible and
available value of the thing. And this responsibility and
fullness of indemnity we have seen it was declared in The
John G. Stevens, supra, distinguished the law of this
country from that of England.
But if the contention were conceded it would not determine these cases. I reject absolutely that because the
Government is exempt from suit it cannot be accused of
fault. Accountability for wrong is one thing, the wrong
is another.
But I do not have to beat about in general reasoning.
I may appeal to the authority of The Siren, 7 Wall. 152,
and the cases that have approved and followed it. A
gloss is attempted to be put upon it-which we think is
unjustified and inaccurate unless indeed, it can be asserted that the writer of the opinion did not know the
meaning of the words he used, and, that the members of
the court who concurred with him, were equally deficient
in understanding. And their insensibility to what the
words conveyed had no excuse. A dissenting justice tried
to bring their comprehensive import to understanding,
proclaimed indeed, that the words had the extent and
consequence that the court now says were not intended
or accomplished.
The Siren, while in charge of a prize master and crew,
having been taken in prize by the United States, ran into
in the port of New York and sank the sloop Harper. The
collision was regarded by the court as the fault of the
Siren. She was condemned as prize and sold and the proceeds deposited with the Assistant Treasurer of the
United States. The owners of the Harper asserted a
claim upon her and her proceeds for the damages sus-

257 U.S.

tained by the collision. The District Court rejected the
claim. Its action was reversed by this court.
The United States was an actor in the case and this was
regrded by the court, who spoke by Mr. Justice Field, as
removing the impediment to the claim of the owners of
the Harper. It was not, however, the basis of recovery.
There was no confusion in the language or conception of
the learned Justice, nor in the court, of that. By becoming the actor, the United States, it was said, waived its
exemption from direct suit and opened " to consideration all claims and equities in regard to the property
libelled "-not, of course, that the waiver of exemption
created the "claims and equities ". They, it was explicitly said, were created against the offending vessel by
the collision. "In such case ", the language was, "the
claim exists equally as if the vessel belonged to a private
citizen, but for reasons of public policy, already stated,
cannot be enforced by direct proceedings against the vessel." And again, "The inability to enforce the claim
against the vessel is not inconsistent with its existence."
The distinction was clearly made between exemption
of the United States, the offence of the vessel and the
existence of a claim against it in consequence of its
offence. And the distinction was emphasized in the dissent of Mr. Justice Nelson. He was at pains to distinguish between liability to suit and legal liability for the
act of injury, the ground of suit. And the basis of his
dissent was the same as the basis of the opinion of the
court in the present cases, but not so epigrammatically
expressed. In the opinion in these cases it is said that
"the United States has not consented to be sued for torts,
and therefore it cannot be said that in a legal sense the
United States has been guilty of a tort. For a tort is a
tort in a legal sense only because the law has made it so."
Mr. Justice Nelson was more discursive. He said that
"if the owner of the offending vessel [he regarded the
Siren as owned by the United States] is not liable at all

THE WESTERN MAID.
419.

McKm&NA, DAY, and CLAR,

J.J., dissenting.

for the collision, it follows, as a necessary legal consequence, that there can be no lien, otherwise the non-liability would amount to nothing." And again, "If -the
government is not responsible, upon the principles of the
common law, for wrongs committed by her officers or
agents, then, whether the proceedings in the admiralty are
against the vessel, or its proceeds, the court is bound to
dismiss them." And giving point to this view the learned
Justice observed that "no principle at common law is
better settled than that the government is not liable for
the wrongful acts of her public agents."
I repeat, that in view of these extracts from Mr. Justice
Nelson's dissent, misapprehension of its opinion by the
court is not conceivable nor carelessness of utterance.
Yet the opinion in the present cases practically so asserts
and, in effect, regards Mr. Justice Nelson's dissent as the
law of the Siren and not that which the court pronounced.
The court decided that the vessel was the offending thing,
and though it could not be reached in the hands of the
Government, this "inability to enforce the claim against
the vessel" was "not inconsistent with its existence."
The inevitable deduction is that in such situation the
enforcement of a claim is suspended only, and when the
vessel passes from the hands of the Government, as the
offending vessels have in the cases at bar, they and " all
claims and equities in regard to" them may be enforced.
The case was commented on in The Davis, 10 Wall. 15,
20, and the gloss now put upon it rejected. It is there
said that the well supported doctrine of the case is"that
proceedings in rem to enforce a lien against property of
the United States are only forbidden in cases where, in
order to sustain the proceeding, the possession of the
United States must be invaded under process of the
court."

So again in Workman v. New York City, 179 U. S. 552,
where it is said, Chief Justice White delivering the opinion
of the court, after an exhaustive review of cases, such as

440

257 U.S.

he usually gave," It results that, in the maritime law, the
public nature of the service upon which a vessel is engaged
at the time of the commission of a maritime tort affords no
immunity from liability in a court of admiralty, where
the court has jurisdiction." In view of this it is difficult
to understand how it can be said that there was nothing
that case decided contrary to the conclusion in these cases.
Against this array of cases and their reasoning, Ex parte
State of New York, No. 2, 256 U. *S. 503, and Ex parte
State of New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490, are adduced.
Neither case has militating force. The latter case decided
nothing but that a State cannot be sued without its consent. An indisputable proposition which this court in its
opinion had to clear from confusing or disturbing circumstances. In the former case, The Queen City, a steam
tug, was in the possession and service of the State of New
York and to have awarded process against it as the District Court did, would have arrested the service. This
court rightfully reversed that action. The tug had not
been released from that immunity as the vessels were in
the pending cases.

Syllabus.

It is not necessary to review or comment upon them.
They are testimony of what the judiciary of the country
considered and consider The Siren and other cases decided.
Therefore we cannot refrain from saying that it is strange,
that notwithstanding the language of The Siren,its understanding and acceptance in many cases in this court, the
enforcement of its doctrine at circuit and district, it should
now be declared erroneous. The cases at bar would seem
to be cases for the application of the maxim of stare decisis
which ought to have force enough to resist a change based
on finesse of reasoning or attracted by the possible accomplishment of a theoretical correctness.
The rules should be discharged.
