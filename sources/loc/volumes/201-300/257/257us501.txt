If Corneli had only suspected the remarkable power of
the Forty-second Street Warehouse to attach itself to the
dwellings of all patrons, without regard to distance, he
might have chosen a safer course. He stored where the
statute said he might. Now he is told that no analogy
exists between his lonely barrel there and the many "bottles, barrels, casks and cases" which, within more favored
walls, await the pleasure of their owner.

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

257 U. S.

Mr. C. W. King, with whom Mr. S. P. Freeling, Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, was on the brief,
for defendant in error.
It is going far afield for courts to hold that to tax
the lessee of a restricted Indian leasehold upon his share
of gross production of oil and gas, or other mineral, is
indirectly taxing the exercise of. a federal agency, and is,
therefore, invalid; but to go a step farther and say that
to require such lessee to include in his income tax returns net income derived from such source imposes a like
burden would be carrying the idea of guardianship into
too remote a channel to meet the practical applicatidn of
iaxing laws. The theory upon which such contention is
made is that such a tax would have a deterring influence
upon the purchasers of Indian leases. Such argument
resolves itself into a question of degrees.
The contention was made without avail in reference
to grazing leases on Indian lands that if the cattle of the
lessee were taxed he would pay less for the lease to the
Indian. Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264; Maricopa &c.
Ry. Co. v. Arizona, 156 U. S. 347.
The fact that net income is derived from interstate commerce or exports does not remove it from state taxation.
United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, 247 U. S. 321; Peck
& Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165; Shaffer v. Carter,252 U. S.
37; Stafford v. Travis, 132 N. E. 109.
The tax here attaches after all of the functions of the
federal agency have been performed freely and untrammelled, after the lessee has received his compensation
and after, with the close of his year's business, it is found
that he is possessed of a net income. To hold the tax a
burden upon the lease would be to repudiate the entire
scheme of net income taxation; that is, the net income
regarded as a taxable subject-matter severed from its
source. The income when it has reached this stage has
become the individual acquisition of the taxpayer as coin-

pletely as any other form of property and may be invested
in other enterprises not connected with the business from
which it came. To deny that proposition denies the
power of the State to designate income as a subject of
taxation.
If, however, the court should determine that the rule
announced in the gross production tax cases does not
apply to the Income Tax Act of Oklahoma, then defendant in error urges that the rule announced in the decided
cases going up from Oklahoma was not determined with
reference to the Oklahoma Act of 1916, and, as applied to
the Act of 1916, the holding in the former cases-Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S.
292; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma,
240 U. S. 522-would be incorrect; and, further, that in
determining the cases of Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247
U. S. 503, and Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549,
which did involve the Act of 1916, they were decided without reference to that act and without a careful regard to
its provisions, but upon the theory that the statute involved was the former one previously construed; and
those cases should, therefore, be overruled.
Min. JuS icE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

Chapter 164, Oklahoma Laws of 1915, makes every
person of the State liable to a tax upon his entire net income arising from all sources, except such as is exempt
from taxation by some law of the United States or of the
State. Under that statute Oklahoma. seeks in these proceedings to hold the defendant, the plaintiff in error, liable
for taxes for the years 1915; 1916, 1917 and 1918, upon
net income derived by him as lessee from leases of restricted Indian (Creek and Osage) lands, the leases being
of the kind dealt with in Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf
R. R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292, and Indian Territory
Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522. The

facts were set forth by the defendant in special returns
for the years mentioned, claiming exemption under the
Constitution and laws of the United States. The auditor
of the State accepted the returns as true but held that
the defendant was liable to taxes on the income derived
by him from sales of his share of oil and gas received
under his leases. It is agreed that the lessee was an
instrumentality used by the United States in carrying
out duties to the Indians that it had assumed, and that
the only question in the case is whether he is liable to
this kind of tax. The District Court of the State held
the tax void and on appeal by the State the Supreme
Court affirmed the judgment, but upon rehearing changed
its mind and ordered the judgment reversed.
In Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf R. R. Co. v. Harrison,
235 U. S. 292, it was held that such a lessee could not be
taxed on the gross sales of coals from Choctaw and Chickasaw mines, when the tax was in addition to the taxes
collected upon an ad valorem basis. In Indian Territory
Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522, it was
held that a similar lessee could not be taxed upon the
value of an Osage oil lease. Subsequently the principle
was applied per curiam to gross production taxes under a
later statute of 1916, without reference to the fact that
the taxes, instead of being in addition to, were in lieu of
all taxes upon property rights. Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co.,
247 U. S. 503. Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549.
The argument for the State is based primarily upon
the cases sustaining taxes upon net income that include
gains from interstate commerce, Shaffer v. Carter, 252
U. S. 37, 57; United Statei Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, 247
U. S. 321; when "all expenses are paid and losses adjusted, and after the recipient of the income is free to' use
it as he chooses." Peck & Co. v. Lowe, 247 U. S. 165, 175.
It is said also that tangible property within the State is
subject to taxation and that therefore the defendant's

share of oil and gas cannot escape. If the cases that we
have mentioned as decided per curiam tend to oppose the
State's position, on the ground that if the property is
exempt the income from it also is exempt, it is urged that
so far as appears the distinction between the statute of
1916 then before the Court and the statutes dealt with by
the authorities cited in those cases was overlooked.
We cannot assume that there was the oversight supposed. The decision in 240 U. S. 522, that such leases
were not taxable went on general principles not on the
nature of the particular statute, and in Shaffer v. Carter,
252 U. S. 37, 48, a case that adverted to the distinction relied upon, pp. 57, 58, the decisions per curiam were referred to as decided upon the merits. Those decisions appear to us to have been correct. The criterion of interference by the States with interstate commerce is one of
degree. It is well understood that a certain amount of
reactibn upon and interference with such commerce cannot be avoided if the States are to exist and make laws.
New York, New Haven & HartfordR. R. Co. v New York,
165 U. S. 628. Diamond Glue Co. v. United States,Glue
Co., 187 U. S. 611, 616. The rule as to instrumentalities
of the United States on the other hand is absolute in
form and at least stricter in substance. Williams v. Talladega,226 U. S. 404,416,417,419. Johnsonv.Maryland,
254 U. S. 51, 55. "A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the
power to make them, and could be used to destroy the
power to make them." 240 U. S. 530. The step from
this to the invalidity of the tax upon income from the
leases is not long.
In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from
interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from
which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from
such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429; 158 U. S. 601; a rule
lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245; and ap-

plied in a case somewhat like the present by the Supreme
Court of Hawaii. Oahu Ry. & Land Co. v. Pratt, 14
Hawaii, 126. Whether this property could be taxed in
any other form or not, it cannot be reached as profits or
income from leases such as those before us. The same
considerations that invalidate a tax upon the leases invalidate a tax upon the profits of the leases, and, stopping
short of theoretical possibilities, a tax upon such profits
is a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States
to make the best terms that it can for its wards. Weston
v. Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 468. The taxation of cattle
grazing in Indian lands held valid in Thomas v. Gay, 169
U. S. 264, 273, obviously is more remote. As a writ of
error lies in this case the petition for. certiorari that was
presented for greater caution will be denied. DahnkeWalker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, ante, 282.
