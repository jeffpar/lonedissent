This suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the
executors of Abraham Wolff of New Jersey to have refunded $58,885.86 paid in taxes assessed upon legacies
under the provisions of ยง 29 of the Act of June 13, 1898,

KAHN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

c. 448, 30 Stat. 448, 464-465. Wolff died on October 1,
1900. The taxes were paid on November 4, 1903. This
suit was begun July 2, 1917. The contention is that the
legacies were contingent beneficial interests not vested in
possession or enjoyment on, or prior to, July 1, 1902; and
that hence the amount paid is recoverable under the Acts
of June 27, 1902, c. 1160, ยง 3, 32 Stat. 406, and of July
27, 1912, c. 256, 37 Stat. 240. The lower court dismissed
the petition. Whether the interests assessed were contingent on July 1, 1902, and whether the claim sued on
had been presented to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as required by the Act of 1912, are the questions
argued before us. The view we take of the first question
renders it unnecessary to consider the second.
Earlier decisions have settled the construction of these
statutes. The test to be applied in determining whether
the legacies were, on July 1, 1902, still contingent is a
practical, not a technical one. The beneficial interests
were contingent unless the legatees were then in actual
possession or enjoyment, Henry v. United States, 251 U. S.
393, or were entitled to immediate possession or enjoyment, United States v. Jones, 236 U. S. 106; McCoach v.
Pratt,236 U. S. 562; Coleman v. United States, 250 U. S.
30; Sage v. United States, 250 U. S. 33. But a gift to
trustees of a fund, the net income of which is to be paid
over periodically during life, is, at least after the payments have commenced, a life estate, not a contingent
beneficial interest. United States v. Fidelity Trust Co.,
222 U. S. 158. And the mere failure of executors to establish the trust fund will not prevent the vesting of a legacy,
if under the state law the time for payment has come, the
right thereto is uncontroverted, and it is clear that the
money retained will not be needed to satisfy outstanding
claims. Simpson v. United States, 252 U. S. 547.
Wolff provided by his will, among other things, for
fifteen separate trust funds, ranging in amount from

$20,000 to $100,000 and aggregating $730,000. The income of each was made payable for life to the beneficiary
without power of anticipation or assignment. Provision
was made that the executors should, until the several
trusts were established, pay monthly to each a sum
named; and these amounts were approximately, but not
exactly, proportionate to the probable income of the respective funds. There was also a provision that if the
aggregate amount of the funds to be so established should
exceed one-fifth of the net estate, each should be proportionately reduced. A trust of the residue was provided
for the benefit of the testator's daughters. The amount
or value of the fifteen trusts was ascertainable before
July 1, 1902. None of the funds directed to be paid to
the trustees had been paid to them, or set apart or established by that date; but no reason was shown why they
should not have been. The value of the estate (over
seven million dollars) was such, and was before that date
known to be such, that no pending controversy or outstanding claim could affect the value of any but the
residuary legacies; and these only to a slight extent. The
executors paid before that date certain small legacies, the
fixed monthly allowances to the fifteen beneficiaries, and
to each of the residuary legatees, as income, more than
$300,000.
The will was admitted to probate by the Orphans
Court for Morris County, on November 7, 1900, and letters testamentary issued on that day. By the law of New
Jersey executors are required to state and settle their
accounts within a year after their appointment, unless
the time is extended for cause. The Orphans Court is
empowered to fix a period of nine months for the presentation of claims against the estate; and claims not presented within that time may be declared barred. If no
time is fixed in a will for the payment of legacies they are
payable within a year after the probate; and if not so paid,
legatees may maintain an action therefor. Publication of

Syllabus.

the notice to creditors to present their claims within nine
months was begun on November 7, 1900. On August 8,
1901, that court entered an order declaring that creditors
who had neglected to do so, were barred. On July 1, 1902,
the only unadjusted matters, so far as shown, were claims
for taxes for relatively small sums. These were not finally
disposed of until November, 1903.
On July 1, 1902, therefore, the trustees were entitled to
the possession of the funds and all the beneficiaries to the
immediate enjoyment of the income thereof, with the exception of the amount involved in controversies over
taxes. The executors might then have paid over the
balance of the estate in their hands to the trustees, retaining funds sufficient to satisfy the claims in dispute.
The amount on which the taxes here in question were
assessed is not shown to have exceeded the amount of
such balance. The beneficial interests were, therefore,
vested; and taxes were properly assessed thereon. In Vanderbilt v. Eidman, 196 U. S. 480, and Uterhart v. United
States, 240 U. S. 598, the facts were different.
