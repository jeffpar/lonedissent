CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE PHILIPPINE
ISLANDS.

Nos. 138, 140, 142. Argued November 10, 1921.-Decided December
5, 1921.
1. Taxes on the value of exports from the Philippine Islands collected under a Philippine Act, effective July 1, 1916, while duties
on such exports were forbidden by the Act of Congress of August
29, 1916, c. 416, 39 Stat. 545, were legalized, ratified and confirmed
by the congressional Act of June 5, 1920, c. 253, 41 Stat. 1015, 1025.
P. 231.
2. This was within the power of Congress (United States v. Heinszen
& Co., 206 U. S. 370,) even where the parties taxed had obtained
judgments for restitution, in the Supreme Court of the Philippines,
before the date of the ratifying statute but where the judgments at
that date were still reviewable and subsequently were reviewed in
this court by certiorari. P. 232.

Mr. Grant T. Trent, with whom Mr. CassiusM. Dowell
was on the briefs, for petitioner.
Mr. Clarence B. Miller, with whom Mr. W. H. Lawrence, Mr. J. G. Lawrence and Mr. Frederick C. Fisher
were on the briefs, for respondents.
The transactions involved were exports.
The taxes in question were not legalized by the Act of
Congress"of July 1, 1916, 39 Stat. 286; nor by the Act of
June 4, 1918, 40 Stat. 597.
The Act of Congress of June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. 1025,
can not have the effect of confiscating the judgments under review. The Smith, Bell & Company case was commenced in the Court of First Instance of Manila in February, 1918; in July, 1918, that court ordered the entry of
judgment; both parties appealed; the Philippine Supreme
Court entered its judgment in March, 1920. The Cornpania General case was commenced in the Court of First
Instance January 23, 1917; judgment in favor of respondent was rendered November 26, 1917; both parties appealed to the Supreme Court and judgment there was
given in favor of respondent March 16, 1920. The Visayan Refining Company case was commenced in the Court
of First Instance on January 20, 1917; judgment in favor
of respondent was entered by that court on November 26,
1917; both parties appealed to the Supreme Court and
judgment there was given in favor of respondent March
18, 1920. By these judgments respondents became entitled to recover from petitioner the amounts which the
petitioner had exacted as taxes under the ostensible authority of ยง 1614, Act No. 2657.

require particular notice. All are distinguishable in that
they do not involve the overthrow of judgments, and
most of them present other obvious and vital differences
that make them inapplicable herein. None of them goes
so far toward being in point as United States v. Heinszen
& Co., 206 U. S. 370, and if that case is not controlling,
all the others fall with it.
The proposition that a statute may divest rights established by a judgment is so abhorrent to our fundamental principles and to natural justice, as well as to familiar constitutional limitations, that there are few instances in our jurisprudence where the attempt has been
made and passed upon. Nevertheless, there is plain condemnation of the theory in the decisions of this court.
McCullough v. Virginia, 172 U. S. 102, 103; Stephens v.
Cherokee Nation, 174 U. S. 445, 478; Pennsylvania v.
Wheeling Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 431; Haley v. City,
68 Pa. St. 45; Taylor v. Place, 4 R. I. 337; Sanders v.
Cabaniss, 43 Ala. 184; Lawson v. Jeffries, 47 Miss. 702;
Griffin v. Cunningham, 20 Gratt. 54. While United
States v. Heinszen & Co. holds that a congressional ratification may destroy a mere right of action, practically
overruling in this respect DeLima v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 1,
yet the reasoning, by distinction, compels the conclusion
that a claim reduced to judgment is immune.
The immunity of respondents' judgments from legislative confiscation does not depend upon their finality in the
sense of not being subject to judicial review. If the interposition of this court had the effect of vacating the judgments and bringing the causes here to be tried de novo,
the case might, arguably, be different; but, upon the allowance of the writ, the judgment is reviewed "as if brought
up by writ of error," and it is precarious only to the extent
that error may be found. If the judgment is declared
free from error, its affirmance by this court will in no way
enhance its value or change its character. The ultimate

RAFFERTY v. SMITH, BELL & CO.
226.

Argument for Respondents.

question is whether the judgments are "property" of respondents, such as may not be taken without due process;
the review herein is an examination of respondents' title
to the property-not a proceeding from which such title
may arise. A judgment creditor in a case reviewable for
error may be divested of his property in the judgment,
but only by" due process of law "-which judicial reversal
is, and legislative confiscation is not.
There is a fundamental difference between the ratification sustained in the Heinszen Case, and the ratification
asserted by petitioner herein, in that the one supplied a
mere absence of prior authority, while the other is invoked
'to cure an express denial of authority. This difference is
inferentially recognized in the Heinszen opinion, p. 382.
It is obvious that where the principal has denied authority to his agent and third parties have relied upon
such denial, the principal may not thereafter retroactively
give validity, in prejudice of such third parties, to acts of
the agent in contumacious exercise of the power denied.
The distinction is clear between an act of Congress
withdrawing the Government's consent to be sued, and an
act which pretends to relieve one individual from his
judgment debt to another.
Respondents' vested rights in their judgments are analogous to vested rights secured by expmption from taxation. Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665; Ward v. Love
County, 253 U. S. 17.
Even in the Philippine Islands no person may "be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of
law."
From a misunderstanding of the Insular Cases and
certain subsequent decisions of this court there has arisen
a wide-spread belief that Congress has power unlimited
to legislate for the Insular Possessions. This belief has
no foundation in the decisions of this court, and none in
principle.

OCTOBER TERM, 1921.

257 U. S.

If there is no decision of this court affirmatively applying any guaranty or limitation of the Constitution in the
Philippine Islands or Porto Rico, the reason is plain;
the occasion has not arisen.
In cases wherein insular legislatures have encroached
upon personal rights, the decisions have been based upon
the guaranties of congressional organic laws, and the
court has avoided as unnecessary determining whether
the corresponding provisions of the Constitution would
have been applicable. Kepner v. United States, 195
U. S. 100, 124.
On the other hand, the power of Congress over the
Insular Possessions is derived from the same provision
of the Constitution-Art. IV, ยง 3, par. 2-which supported the jurisdiction of Congress in the Territories
which later became States. And it has been held that
in legislating for those Territories Congress was not
wholly exempt from constitutional limitations.
It has been held that the uniformity clause of Art. I,
ยง 8, does not apply to duties imposed by Congress in the
Possessions, because the section requires uniformity only
"throughout the United States," and the Possessions are
not a part of the United States. Downes v. Bidwell, 182
U. S. 224, 262. But in that case even the majority of the
court conceded that the Constitution contains limitations
which operate upon the power of Congress wherever exercised. See also, Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197;
Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S.138.
The grounds of dissent in the Insular Cases show that
all of the Justices were agreed that the "general prohibitions" in support of "natural rights" limited the power
of Congress to legislate for the Possessions.
Among these effective limitations ii certainly that of
the Fifth Amendment. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cr. 87.
The ratification by Act of June 5, 1920, covers only
the period between July 1 and August 29, 1916.

Opinion of the Court.

If petitioner's collection of the taxes was unlawful, the
award of interest was not error.

This is not an action against the Government.
MR.JusTIcE MRYaYwoLDS delivered the opinion of the

court.
These cases turn upon the same question and were argued together. In our view they can be disposed of by
applying the Act of Congress, approved June 5, 1920, c.
253, 41 Stat. 1015, 1025, without passing upon any other
point.
Acting under ostensible authority of ยง 1614, Act 2657,
Philippine Legislature, approved February 24, 1916, and
effective July 1 thereafter, the Collector of Internal Revenue for the Philippine Islands levied and collected the
taxes here challenged upon the value of certain commodities exported from those Islands by respondents between
October 1, 1916, and September 30, 1917.
The Supreme Court of the Islands gave judgments for
the respondents during March, 1920. Petitions for writs
of certiorari filed here in September thereafter and within
time prescribed by law, were allowed. Act of Congress,
approved September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726.
Section 1614, Act 2657. "All merchants not herein
specifically exempted shall pay a tax of one per centum
on the gross value in money of the commodities, goods,
wares, and merchandise sold, bartered, exchanged, or consigned abroad by them, such tax to be based on the actual
selling price or value at which the things in question are
disposed of or consigned, whether consisting of raw material or of manufactured or partially manufactured products, and whether of domestic or foreign origin.

Section 11, Act of Congress, approved August 29,

export duties shall be levied or collected on exports from
the Philippine Islands, but taxes and assessments on

property and license fees for franchises, and privileges,
and internal taxes, direct or indirect, may be imposed for
the purposes of the Philippine government and the provincial and municipal governments thereof, respectively,
as may be provided and defined by acts of the Philippine
Legislature, and, where necessary to anticipate taxes and
revenues, bonds and other obligations may be issued by
the Philippine government or any provincial or municipal
government therein, as may be provided by law and to
protect the public credit.
The Act of Congress, approved June 5, 1920, supra,provides: "The taxes imposed by the Philippine Legislature
in section 1614 of the Act Numbered 2657, enacted by
that body on February 24, 1916, are legalized and ratified,
and the collection of all such taxes made under or by
authority of such Act of the Philippine Legislature is
legalized, ratified, and confirmed as fully to all intents
and purposes as if the same had by prior Act of Congress
been specifically authorized and directed."
We think the language last quoted was intended to apply to the taxes collected from respondents, here called in
question, and that it is sufficiently broad to include them.
That the enactment is within the power of Congress
necessarily follows from the doctrine announced in
United States v. Heinszen & Co., 206 U. S. 370, 386,
et seq.
The judgments below were subject to review here and
the mere fact that the causes had proceeded to such stage
gave respondents no higher rights than those possessed by
Heinszen & Company, whose action to recover, although
instituted prior to the passage of that enactment, was
held to have been barred by the Act of June 30, 1906, c.
3912, 34 Stat. 636.

1. No suit to recover damages for the death of a human being
caused by negligence may be maintained in the admiralty courts of
the United States under the general maritime law. P. 240.
2. But where death upon navigable waters follows from a maritime
tort committed on navigable waters within a State whose statutes
give a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the
admiralty courts will entertain a libel in personam,for the damages
sustained by those to whom such right is given. P. 242.
3. The state statutes of limitation are applicable to such proceedings
in the federal courts. So held, in a case where the injury and death
occurred within the State where the libel was brought and whose
statutes, creating the cause of action and providing a limitation,
