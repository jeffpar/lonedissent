these circumstances and this state of the authorities in
this court, it is frivolous to claim that a statute of procedure, by its failure to give jurisdiction over foreign corporations in transitory actions arising in another State,
constitutes a lack of due process of which plaintiff in error
can complain. In such a case the writ must be dismissed.

UNITED STATES v. M. RICE & COMPANY ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF CUSTOMS
APPEALS.

No. 114. 'Argued January 26, 1922.-Decided February 27, 1922.
In an importer's protest, under par. N of the Tariff Act of 1913,
against a collector's decision on classification of goods, it is not
necessary to set up the similitude clause (par. 386), which merely
prescribes a rule of construction applicable to every paragraph of
the tariff imposing duty on specifically described articles. P. 538.
10 Cust. App. 165, affirmed.
CERTIORARI to review a judgment of the Court of Customs Appeals which, reversing a judgment order of the
Board of General Appraisers (unpublished abstract No.
43,391; 37 T. D. 355; Brown, G. A., dissenting), sustained
the respondents' claim.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Hoppin, with whom
Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr. Samuel Isenschmid
were on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. J. Stuart Tompkins for respondents.
MR. CHIEF JusTicE TAF delivered the opinioh of the
court.
This case involves the sufficiency of a protest necessary
to justify a suit against the United States for duties
illegally exacted. The Board of General Appraisers found
the protest defective and refused relief. The Court of
Customs Appeals on appeal reversed this action and gave
judgment for the importer. 10 Cust. App. 165. The case
comes here by certiorari under ยง 195 of the Judicial Code,
as amended August 22, 1914, c. 267, 38 Stat. 703.
The subject of importation was immortelles. They
were entered April 3, 1916, at the port of Philadelphia,
and the duty was liquidated June 8, 1916. The Collector
levied duty on them at 60 per cent. ad valorem under
paragraph 347 of the Tariff Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16,
38 Stat. 114, 148. The protest of the importer of July
7, 1916, set forth that the immortelles were dutiable
"at the rate of 25% ad valorem under the first clause of
paragraph 210 as palms or cut flowers, preserved or fresh."
38 Stat. 114, 133.
The question as to the proper classification of the immortelles was settled by a decision of the Court of Customs Appeals in Bayersdorfer v. United States, 7 Cust.
App. 66, and the legal duty is conceded to be 25 per cent.
ad vdIorem by resemblance to the articles named in paragraph 210. The sole question here is whether under the
form of protest presented the importer could rely upon
the similitude clause (paragraph 386) of the statute and
claim that the immortelles were taxable at the rate fixed

in paragraph 210, because of their resemblance to articles
therein described.
Paragraph N of the Tariff Act of 1913, 38 Stat. 114,
187, provides:
"That the decision of the collector as to the rate and
amount of duties chargeable upon imported merchandise
shall be final and conclusive against all persons
: .
interested therein, unless the owner, importer, consignee,
or agent of such merchandise . . . shall, within
thirty days after but not before such ascertainment and
liquidation of duties. . . . if dissatisfied with such
aecision imposing a higher rate of duty, . . . file a
protest or protests in writing with the collector, setting
forth therein distinctly and specifically, and in respect to
each entry or payment, the reasons for his objections
.
.
thereto.
The relevant part of paragraph 386 of the same act
provides:
"That each and every imported article, not enumerated in this section, which is similar, either in material,
quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied,
to any article enumerated in this section as chargeable
with duty, shall pay the same rate of duty which is levied
on the enumerated article which it most resembles in
any of the particulars before mentioned. . ....
The point here raised has long been in dispute. In
Hahn v. Erhardt,78 Fed. 620 (1897), the Circuit Court of
Appeals of the Second Circuit held that mention in the
protest of the paragraph fixing the duty on specifically
described articles, without more, would not give the collector reason to suppose that the importer claimed the
importation came under such paragraph by virtue of the
similitude clause, and therefore was defective. In In re
Guggenheim Smelting Co., 112 Fed. 517 (1901), the
Circuit Court of Appeals held a protest sufficient to
justify recovery which claimed classification under a

UNITED STATES v. RICE & CO.
536.

Opinion of the Court.

named paragraph, although the article imported could
only be so classified by virtue of the similitude clause.
In United States v. Dearberg Bros., 135 Fed. 245, the
same point arose in the Circuit Court, S. D. New York,
and the Board of General Appraisers was sustained in
holding the protest sufficient under the authority of the
Guggenheim Case. This was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, 143 Fed. 472 (1905), without opinion,
on the authority of the Hahn Case. Thereafter the Board
of General Appraisers, in this and other cases, has by a
majority vote followed the Hahn Case. In the case of
United States v. Snellenburg & Co., 9 Cust. App. 59, the
Court of Customs Appeals held a protest sufficient which
mentioned a.special paragraph without more, although
the article imported could only be brought under the
paragraph by virtue of a similitude paragraph. The
Court of Customs Appeals, in the judgment here under
review,, followed the Snelenburg Case and sustained the
protest, one member of the court dissenting. It is because of this somewhat exceptional contrariety of opinion
existing among General Appraisers, Circuit Courts of Appeals and Judges of the Court of Customs Appeals, that
this court has granted a certiorari herein.
The protest and similitude clauses have appeared in all
tariff acts since 1842 in substantially the same form as in
paragraph N and paragraph 386 of the Tariff Act of 1913,
so that the authorities construing other tariff acts have
application to the present question.
A protest must be distinct and specific enough to show
that the objection taken at the hearing or trial was at the
time of filing the protest in the mind of the importer and
sufficient to notify the collector of its true nature and
character to the end that he might then ascertain the precise facts and have adequate opportunity to correct mistakes and cure defects. Heinze v. Arthur's Executors,

Opinion of the Court.

562; Arthur v. Morgan, 112 U. S. 495, 501; Arthur v.
Dodge, 101 U. S. 34, 37; Greely's Administrator v. Burgess, 18 How. 413, 416. But no special form is required.
"A protest which indicates to an intelligent man the
ground of the importer's objection to the duty levied upon
the articles should not be discarded because of the brevity
with which the objection is stated." Schell's Executors
v. Fauch, supra. "We are not, therefore, disposed to
exact any nice precision, nor to apply any strict rule of
construction upon the notices required under this statute.
It is sufficient if the importer indicates distinctly and definitely the source of his complaint, and his design to make
it the foundation for a claim against the government."
Greely's Administratorv. Burgess, supra.
Does a claim in a protest under a particular paragraph,
with no more, adequately indicate to the collector that the
importer intends to claim the article imported may come
under the specified paragraph either directly, or by resemblance to articles therein described?
In Arthur v. Fox, 108 U. S. 125, this court said:
"If an article is found not enumerated in the tariff laws,
then the first inquiry is whether it 'bears a similitude,
either in material, quality, texture, or use to which it may
as chargebe applied, to any article enumerated . .
able as with duty.' If it does, and the similitude is substantial, then, in the language of the court in Stuart v.
Maxwell [16 How. 150] 'it is to be deemed the same, and
to be charged accordingly.' In other words, although not
specifically enumerated, it is provided for under the name
ofi the article it most resembles."
The part of paragraph 386 under consideration prescribes a rule of construction applicable to every paragraph of the tariff, imposing duty on specifibally described
articles. It is a general provision intended to enlarge the
scope of each paragraph to include articles not specifically
described but fesembling articles specified. The collector

Syllabus.

must be taken to be familiar with the general provisions
of the tariff act. When an importer specifies in his protest a paragraph under which he claims his importation
should be classified, the collector should enquire not only
whether the article comes within the paragraph named,
but also whether it so resembles the articles specifically
described therein as to require it to be classified thereunder. After satisfying himself that the article does not
come within the specific description of the named paragraph, its resemblance to articles which do should be his
"first inquiry."
The quoted words of paragraph 386 mention no specific
rate. Any reference to them in a protest would be meaningless unless accompanied by mention of some taxing
paragraph. It is the latter which taxes the article under
the general rule of interpretation which these words fur-

nish.
It is said thereby that resemblance.is a question of fact,
but it is one not very different from that involved in the
classification of articles within the specifiQ description of
the paragraph. The object of the protest is to put the
collector on inquiry not alone as to the law but also as to
the facts which make the law applicable. The reasoning of the Court of Customs Appeals meets our approval
and the judgment is
Affirmed.
