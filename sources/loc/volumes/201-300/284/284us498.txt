Statement of the Case.

2. Tax laws are to be interpreted liberally in favor of taxpayers;
words defining things to be taxed may not be extended beyond
their clear import; doubts must be resolved against the Government
and in favor of the taxpayer. P. 508.
3. R. S. § 3224 is declaratory of the equitable rule that a suit will not
lie to restrain the collection of a tax upon the sole ground of its
illegality; and it should be construed as nearly as may be in harmony with that rule and the reasons upon which it rests. P. 509.
4. The section is general and should not be construed as abrogating,
by implication, the other equitable principle which permits suit to
restrain collection where not only is the exaction illegal but there
exist special and extraordinary circumstances sufficient to bring
the case within some acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence.
Id.
5. The Oleomargarine Tax Act, before the Amendment of July 10,
1930, did not apply to substances resembling butter but containing
no animal fat. P. 506.
The product in question was made exclusively of cocoanut and
peanut oils, salt, water and harmless coloring matter, and was sold
for cooking, baking and seasoning.
6. Plaintiff made and sold a product not taxable under the Oleomargarine Act, in reliance upon determinations by courts and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue interpreting the Act as inapplicable
in like cases and upon assurance from the Bureau that its product
would not be taxed. Later the Commissioner changed his ruling,
and while not attempting t6 collect from other makers of like products who had obtained injunctions in which he had acquiesced and
which had become final, directed that the tax be enforced against
plaintiff's entire.product from the beginning. This would have destroyed the business, ruined the plaintiff financially and inflicted
loss without remedy at law. Held that the Commissioner's action
was not only based upon an erroneous construction of the statute,
but'was arbitrary and capricious, and that a suit could be maintained in the circumstances, to enjoin the collection. Pp. 508, 510.
42 F. (2d) 79, 85, affirmed.

the Collector was exceeding his jurisdiction. Cf. Nichols

Trinacia Real Estate Co. v. Clarke, 34 F. (2d) 325, the
action of the Collector was obviously arbitrary. In Long
v. Rasmussen, 281 Fed. 236, the complainant was a stranger to the tax. In Mertz v. Mellon, 6 Am. Fed. Tax Rep.,

The decision below is the first to hold that vegetable
oils were not included among the ingredients named in
§ 2 of the taxing statute. The earlier cases turned upon
the question whether the particular product under consideration was made "in imitation or semblance of butter,
or, when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as
butter or for butter." Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page, 297 Fed.

Butterine Co. v. Mellon, 1 Prentice-Hall Fed. Tax Ser.,
1927, p. 1872.
Each product must be judged on its own content, form,and other attributes; and one unfavorable decision could
not bind the petitioner so as to justify a restraint against
the performance of his duties in connection with other
products.
As the Commissioner construed the Oleomargarine Act
as applying to mixtures or compounds of vegetable oils,
and as there was a basis for his conclusion that the respondent's product -was made in imitation or semblance
of butter, it is obvious that his action in assessing the tax
was not -arbitrary or capricious.
If there is any exception to the application of § 3224 of
the Revised Statutes, this case is not within it. Hill v.

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
No. 251.
Respondent, a manufacturer of " Southern Nut Product," brought' this suit in the Southern District of Florida
to restrain petitioner from collecting from respoiadent,
or from dealers selling its product, any tax purporting to
be levied under the Oleomargarine Act of August 2, 1886,
24 Stat. 209, as amended by the Act of May 9, 1902, 32
Stat. 194. Petitioner answered, denying the essential allegations of the complaint. Respondent applied for a temporary injunction, the court found that it would suffer
irreparable injury unless petitioner were restrained pending the final disposition of the case, and granted the
application. At the trial respondent introduced oral and

MILLER v. NUT MARGARINE CO.
498

Opinion of the Court.

documentary evidence together with specimens of the
product sought to be taxed. The court found that the material allegations of the complaint-were established by the
evidence and granted permanent injunction. The record
states in condensed form the-substance of the testimony
but does not contain the documents which were made
exhibits and introduced in evidence. The Circuit Court
of Appeals found, and it appears from the testimony
brought up, that omitted exhibits constitute a material
part of the evidence received and that the record is consistent with the trial court's conclusion in respect of the
facts; it held R. S., § 3224, does not apply and affirmed
the decree. 49 F. (2d) 79, 82, 85.
That section declares (26 U. S. C., § 154): " No suit
for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court." This
suit was commenced December 26, 1929. The complaint,*
the evidence contained in the record, and documents of
which judicial notice may be taken, show the following
facts:
In April, 1928, respondent commenced, and thereafter
carried on, at.Jacksonville, Florida, the manufacture and
sale of Southern Nut Product. It contained no animal
fat but was made exclusively of cocoanut oil, peanut oil,
salt, water and harmless coloring matter; it was sold in
one pound cartons for cooking, baking and seasoning.
Respondent built up a valuable business in the sale of
the product to dealers in'lorida and other States.
In January, 1922, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued to the Higgins Mahufacturing Company a
permit to manufacture and sell "Nut-Z-All" without
paying the oleomargarine tax thereon. He revoked the
permit in December of the same year and purported to
assess such a tax upon some of that product. The company, having paid it under protest to the collector in
Rhode Island, brought an action against him in the

504

Opinion of the Court.

284 U. S.

United States district court for that Sta6te to recover the
amount so exacted. After hearing evidence, including
the testimony oi chemists in the Bureau of Internal Revenue called in behalf of the collector, the court in April,
1924, found that the product was not made in imitation
or semblance of butter, was not intended to be sold as
or for butter, and was not oleomargarine or taxable as
such, 297 Fed. 644. Thereupon the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary
of the Treasury, promulgated the court's decision as
Treasury Decision 3590, thus informing all concerned that
the product was not subject to the tax.
In August, 1924, the deputy commissioner, in answer
to an,inquiry made by the Institute of Margarine Manufacturers as to the.taxability of "Nut-Z-All," sent a letter
stating: "The court having held the product to be not
•taxable as oleomargarine, the fact that retailers advertise
and sell it as butter, or as a substitute for butter, would
not render them or the manufacturers liable under the.
internal revenue law."
April 1, 1927, the Commissioner, contrary to the court's
decree, Treasury Decision 3590 and his deputy's response
to the Institute's inquiry, promulgated Treasury Decision
4006, which declared products similar to "Nut-Z-A l l"
taxable as oleomargarine if colored to look like butter.
Then the Higgins Manufacturing Company brought suit
in the federal .court for Rhode Island to restrain thecollector from enforcing the tax on its product. The
court, upon the allegations of the complaint admitted by
motion to dismiss, found that the facts there alleged in
respect of taxability were identical with those shown in
the earlier case; that the collector was threatening to enforce the tax which had been adjudged illegal; that if the
tax should be collected plaintiff's- business would be
ruined, and, July -18, 1927, granted temporary injunction,

MILLER v. NUT MARGARINE CO.
498

Opinion of the Court.

20 F. (2d) 948, which was made permanent in December
following.
In July, 1927, the Baltimore Butterine Company
brought suit in the Supreme Court of the District of
Columbia to enjoin the Commissioner and- his deputy
from enforcing the tax as declared in Treasury Decision
4006, against its product "Nu-ine," which was identical
in content and appearance "with "Nut-Z-All ". made by
the Higgins Manufacturing Company, and Southern Nut
Product made by respondent in this case. The court held
the product not taxable and granted a permanent injunction.
No appeal was taken in any of the cases above men•tioned. And the petitioner, by letter, answering an inquiry made by respondent, advised respondent that its
product would not be taxable.as oleomargarine.
Relying on the decision in Higgins Mfg. Co. v. Page,
•297 Fed. 644, Treasury Decision 3590, the deputy commissioner's letter to the Institute and the injunctions above
referred to, respondent believed the product which it proposed to manufacture and sell would not be taxable as
oleomargarine, and, upon receipt of petitioner's letter,
commenced manufacture and sale of the product.
In 1928, pursuant to instructions sent him by the deputy commissioner stating that respondent's product was
held taxable as colored oleomargarine, the petitioner demanded and threatened to collect a tax of ten cents a
pound upon respondent's pr duct. But petitioner made
no 6ffort to collect the tax on "Nut-Z-All" which at the
time of the trial was being sold in Florida. Excluding
the tax from cost, respondent's net profit was approximately three cents per pound. The enforcement of the
Aleomargarine Act against respondent would impose a tax
that respondent would be unable to pay, would subject it
to heavy penalties and the forfeiture of its plant together

with the materials and manufactured product on hand,
and would destroy its business.
The complaint asserts that the exaction of ten cents
per pound, while in the guise of a tax, is really a penalty
imposed to eliminate competition with butter, and is
therefore in excess of the power granted to the Congress
by the Constitution. But, having regard to McCray v.
United States, 195 U. S. 27, 59, we treat the imposition
laid by the Act upon oleomargarine as a valid excise tax.
The rule. that § 3224 does not extend to suits brought
to restrain collection of penalties (Lipke v. Lederer, 259
U. S. 557, 562; Regai Drug Corp. v. Wardell, 260 U. S.
386) does not apply."
Petitioner does not here assign as error the finding below that respondent's product was hot oleomargarine.
lie seeks reversal upon the grounds that the statute forbids injunction against the collection of the tax even if
erroneously assessed; that this assessment wa's made by
the Commissioner under color of his office and was not
arbitrary or capricious, and that, if there is any exception
to the application of § 3224, this case is not within it.
We are of opinion that, as held below and here claimed
by respondent, the product in question was not taxable
as oleomargarine defined by § 2 of the Act of 1886. It
is as follows:
"That for the purposes of this act certain nmanufactured substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures
and compounds, including such mixtures and compounds
with butter, shall be known and designated as 'oleomargarine', namely: All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, Jardine, suine,
and neutral; all lard extracts. and tallow extracts; and all
mixtures and compounds of tallow, beef-fat, suet, lard,
lard-oil, vegetable-oil annotto, and other coloring matter,

Opinion of the Court.

intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or sembhnce

of butter, or when so made, calculated or intended to be
sold as butter or for butter.'

That definition remained in force until July 10, 1931.
It was amended by the Act of July 10, 1930, 46 Stat. 1022,
effective twelve months later, the material parts of which
are printed in the margin.* The hyphen in the phrase
"vegetable-oil" was elhninated and a comma was inserted between those words and" annotto." Words added
are shown in italics and words deleted are within brackets.
When the Act of 1886 was passed various imitations of
and substitutes for butter, the principal ingredients of
which were the fats of cattle and swine, were behig manufactured and sold in large quantities. Products such as
respondent's, which contain no animal fat, were unknown
and were not made in substantial quantities until much
later. There is nothing in the Act, or that has been
brought to our attention, to suggest that Congress anticipated the development of the art later to occur: Annotto had long been used to color butter and cheese and
was then being used to make oleomargarine resemble butter. It is a coloring materiil found in association with
the oil content of the covering of certain tree seeds.
*" Sec. 2. That for the purposes of this Act certain manufactured
substances, certain extracts, and certain mixtures and compounds,
including such mixtures and compounds with butter, shall be known
and designated as 'oleomargarine,' namely: All substances heretofore
known as oleomargarine, oleo,, oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine,
suine, and neutral; all mixtures and compounds of oleomargarine, oleo,
oleomargarine oil, butterine, lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and compounds of tallow,
beef fat, suet, lard, lard oil, fish oil or fish fat, vegetable oil, annatto,
and other coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat;L-if (1) made
in imitation or semblance of butter or [when so made] (2) calculated
or intended to be sold as butter or for butter, or (3) churned, emulsified, or mixed in cream, milk, water, or other liquid, and containing
moisture in excess of I per centum or common salt. . .

508

OCTOBER TERM, 1931.
Opinion of the Court.

284 U. S.

When prepared for sale and use the colorant is contained
in a stiff oily mass that was then well-known in the market. The words "vegetable-oil annotto" appropriately
describe that substance. The hyphen between "vegetable" and "oil" and the absence of any punctuation
mark following them signify that the words so compounded qualify "annotto" and indicate that such- coloring material was meant. And that construction is
strongly supported by the use in the same connection of
the words "and other coloring matter."
Regulations promulgated under the Act omit, the
hyphen.and add a comma thus making the phrase to read
"vegetable oil, annotto." The Commissioner's determination that respondent's product is oleomargarine necessarily was based on that version. It is elementary that
tax laws are to be interpreted liberally in favor of taxpayers and that words defining things to be taxed may not be
extended beyond their clear import. Doubts must be resolved against the Government and in favor of taxpayers.
United States v. Merriam, 263 U. S. 179, 188. Bowers v.
N. Y. & Albany Co., 273 U. S. 346; 350. The legislative
history and passage of the amendatory Act of 1930 show
that the Commissioner as well as the Congress found that
an enlargement of the definition was necessary in order to
cover products such as respondents. The language used
in the original Act was not sufficiently clear and definite
to'include products containing no animal fat. The Commissioner's rendition of the governing phrase was without
warrant.- His determination that respondent's product
was oleomargarine and taxable under the Act was erroneous and, in view af his earlier interpretations and the
court decisions which had become final, must be held arbitrary and capricious. It was without force. Interstate
Commerce Commission v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 227 U. S.

509

Opinion of the Court.

Independently of, -and in cases arising prior to, the
enactment of the provision (Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat.
475) which became R. S., § 3224, this court in harmony
with the rule generally followed in courts of equity held
that a suit will not lie to restrain the collection of a tax
upon the sole ground of its illegality. The principal reason is that, as 'courts are without authority to apportion
or equalize taxes or to make assessments, such suits would
enable those liable for taxes in some amount to delay payment or possibly to escape their lawful burden and so to
-interfere with and thwart the collection of reveffues for
the support of the government. And this court likewise
recognizes the rule that, in cases where complainant shows
that in addition .to the illegality of an exaction in the
guise of a tax there exist special and extraordinary circuimstances sufficient to bring the case within some
acknowledged head of equity jurisprudence, a suit may be
maintained to enjoin the collector. Dows v. Chicago, 11
Wall. 108. Hannewinkle v. Georgetown, 15 'Wall. 547.
State Rairoad Tax Czses, 92 U. S. 575, 614. Section 3224
is declaratory of the principle first mentioned and is to
be construed as near as may be in harmony with it and
the reasons upon which it rests. Cumberland Telephone
&. Telegraph Co. v. Kelly, 160 Fed. 316, 321. Baker v.
Baker, 13 Cal. 87, 95. Bradley v. People, 8 Colo. .599,
604; 9 Pac. 783; 2 Sutherland, 2d Lewis ed., § 454. Th6
section does not refer specifically to the rule applicable to
cases involving exceptional circumstances. The general
words employed are not sufficient, and it would requirespecific language undoubtedly disclosing that purpose, to
warrant the inference that Congress intended to abr6gate
that salutary and well established rule. This court has
given effect to § 3224 in a number of cases. Snyder v.
Marks, 109 U. S. 189, 191. Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U. S.
118, 121. Dodge v. Brady, 240 U. S.. 122. It has never
held the rule to be absolute, but has repeatedly indi-

cated that extraordinary and exceptional circumstances

This is not a case in which the injunction is sought upon
the mere ground of illegality because of error in the
amount of the tax. The article is not covered by the
Act. A valid oleomargarine tax could by no legal possibility have'been assessed against respondent, and therefore the reasons underlying § 3224 apply, if at all, with
little force. LeRoy.v. East Saginaw Ry. Co., 18 Mich.
233, 238-239. Kissingerv. Bean, Fed. Cas. 7853. Respondent commenced business after the product it proposed to make had repeatedly been determined by the
Commissioner and adjudged in courts not to be oleomargarine or taxable under the Act, and upon the assurance
from the Bureau that its product would not be taxed.
For more than a year and a half respondent sold its prod.uct relying upon the aforesaid rulings that it was not subject to tax. If requiked to pay the tax its loss would be
seven cents per pound. Before the Commissioner's latest
-rulingrespondent had made and sold so much thatLthe tax
would have amounted to more than it could pay. Petitioner' acquiesced, in the injunctions granted in Rhode
Island and the District of Columbia and did not assess
any tax upon identical products contemporaneously being
made by complainants in such suits, and directed enforcement agarnst respondent's entire product. Such discrimination conflicts -with the principle underlying the constitutiQnal provision directing that excises-laid by Congress-.
shall be uniform throughout the United States. :It

MR. JUSTICE ST6NE, dissenting.;
In my opinion, R. S. § 3224; which says that "No suit
for the purpose of restraining th&assessment or collection
of. any tax shallbe maintained in any court," .cannot
-rightlybe construed as permitting the present suit, whosa
sole purpose is to'enjoin the collection of a tax. Enacted
in 1867, this statute, for, more than sixty years, has been
consistently applied as- precluding relief,, whatever the
equities alleged.
