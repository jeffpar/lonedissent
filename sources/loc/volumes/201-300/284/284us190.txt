under Oklahoma law, aright to have a nonresident appointed administrator, the parties, ininterest lawfully
applied to an Oklahoma court, and petitioner was -appointed admimstratpr, with the result that the cause
of action for the wrongful death of the decedent vested m
him. His citizenship being the same as.that of one og the
defendants, there was no right of xemoval to the federal

-bell or other signal when the train. was approaching the
crossing, failure to. maintain a propei and sufficient lookout, and failure to comply with an order of. the IllinoisCommerce Commission requiring defendant to stop"all
trains and flag the crossing before they crossed Bond Avenue. The aInswer was a general denial.
At the trial both. parties presented, proofs, and at the
close of the plaintiff's case, as well as at the conclusion
of all the evidence, the defendant moved for a binding
direction, which was refused. The trial judge withdrewfrom th*e jury's consideration all the specifications of negligence except that which charged a, failure to stop the
train and flag the crossing before proceeding over Bond
Avenue. He charged the jury that if these precautions
were omitted tho verdict should be for plaintiff, but if
they were observed, they should find for defendant. The
â€¢jury- found for the plaintiff, and on appeal the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment entered upon that
verdict. 47 F. (2d) 3. This Court granted certiorari.
We need consider only whether upon the whole case
defendant was entitled to a binding direction.
The tracks on which the accident occurred extend from
the railway company's- main line to a freight'yard and
run approximately north and. south, almost parallel' with,
and some seventy-five feet west of, Eighth 9treet. Bond
Avenue, which extends eastwardly and westwardly, crosses
the tracks at a right angle. The traiminvolved -inthe accident consisted of a locomotive -running tender-first and
pulling fty freight carsin a; northerly direction from the
freight yard towards the main tracls.
The plaintiff called four adult witnesses who were at
the scene of the .accident, none of whom saw its actual
occurrence. Each of them was to the east of the train and
each first noticed the plaintiff lying to the west of it after
the locomotive and several cars had completely crossed
Bond Avenue,

Opinion 6Ethe Court.

The plaintiff, who was betweenfive and six years of age
at the time of the accident, testified that he was about to
dross the railroad tracks from west to east and.was- struck
by the front of'the locomotive. He stated repeitedly that
the train was coming from the north, whereas it,is beyond
question that it was coming from the south; and he described the portion of the locomotive which struck him as
the front end which had the cowcather and headlight on
it, although it is beyond question that the tender was in
front. He twice denied that he saw the triin before he was
struck, then said he-aw it half a block distant when he
was on'the first track (there.were three tracks at this point
and the train was on the easternmost) and did not see it
again until just as he was struck. He did not testify
whether or not the train stopped.
A boy, nine yeairs old at the date of'the occurrence, who
wqs standing near the crossing, deposed that several boys
traversed the tracks before the train reached Bond Avenue, -and that the plaintiff, following these boys, was hit
by it-and thrown back. He stated there was a box car in
front of the locomotive, and that the car had passed-before
the jllaintiff received his injury. He probably confused
the tender with a box car, and his description of the accident would indicate that the plaintiff collided with the
side'of the locomotive near the cab.
A girl, who was ten years old at the time of the accident, testified that she saw the occurrence from the vestibule of a school house located south of Bond Avenue and
west of the railroad tracks. She stated that she was able
to see what happened by-looking throughan aperture in
a board fence caused by the falling down of a gate inthe
fence. The only gate to which her testimony could have
referred was at-a point so situated with reference to the
crcssing as to render it impossible for one standing where
she was to see the crossing through the gateway. She
says the locomotive struck the plaintiff, but does not say

what part of it came into contact with him. She also
states that the train did not stop before entering upon
the crossing.
Only one of the adult witnesses stated the train did,
not come to a stop. She was a passenger in an, automobile, traveling west on Bond Avenue, which was held up
by the passing train.. This testimony was shown to have
no adequate foundation by her admission that when she
first noticed the train the l6comotive and several cars had
crossed Bond Avenue.
It is argued that it may be inferred from the speed of
the train when some of the witne sse's observed it ,crossing
other streets as well as Bond Avenue, and from a guess
of the engineer as to the time required to get. up such
speed after a full'stop, that none could have been made atBond Avenue. But the argument amounts to mere speculation in-view -of the limited scope of the witnesses' observation, the. down grade of.the railway tracks at the
point,, and the time element involved. (Compare Chicago,
M. & St. P. R. Co. v. Coogan, 271 U. S. 472.) Five witnesses for defendant testified that a full-stop was made
and the crossing flagged, and that no one was hit by the
rar of the tender, which was the front of the train.
.Anexamination of the record requires the conclusion
that the evidence on the issue whether the train was
-stopped before crossing Bond Avenue was so insubstantial and insufficient that it did not justify a submission of
that issue to the jury. Gulf M. & N. R. Co.v. Wells, 275
U. S. 455; Kansas C. S. Ry. Co. v. Jones, 276 U. S. 303;
New-York Centra-R. Co. v. Ambrose, 280 U. S. 486;
Gunning v. Cooley,,281 U. S.90, 93; Atchison, T. & S. F.
By.Co. v. Tobps, 281 U. S.351.
There is no proof whatever that the alleged failure to
stop before entering the crossing was the proximate cause
of the plaintiff's injury. Such direct- testimdny as there is
on his behalf indicates P collision between him and the side

of the train after. the front part of it, which in this case
was the rear end of the tender, had passed hi5n; and: all
of the evidence both for plaintiff and for defendant is
consistent with this view of what happened. It is clear
that on this ground also a binding direction in favor of
the defendant'should have been given.
