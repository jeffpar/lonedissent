v. INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF ILLINOIS
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COUjRT OF COOK COUNTY,
ILLINOIS.

No. 79. Argued December 1, 1931.-Decided January 4, 1932.
A railway employee, while occupied in oiling an 'electric motor which
is used for hoisting coal into a chute, to be thence taken and used

by locomotives principally employed in moving interstate freight,
is not engaged in interstate transportati6n, or in work so closely
related to it as to be practically a part of it; and therefore an
injury suffered by him while so occupied is not within the Federal
Employers' Liability Act. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington,

MR. JusTic, SuTHERLA-D delivered the opinion of the
Court. Thomas, an emnployee of the railroad company, in attempting to 9il an electric motor while it was running, was
injured by having his hand caught in the gears. The railroad was engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. The motor furnished power for hoisting coal into
a chute, to be taken therefrom by, and for the use of,
locomotive engines principally employed in the movement
of interstate freight. An action was brought before the'
*Industrial Commission of Illinois to,recover compensation
for the injury under the provisions-Qf the Workmen's
Compensation Act of Illinois.
The railroad company contended, and an arbitrator,
appointed by the commission, found, that the work in
which Thomas was engaged was in interstate commerce,
that the case, therefore, was not within the state act and
the commission was without jurisdiction. The commis-'
sion, on review, held otherwise and awarded compensation
aggregating $2,184.64. The court below affirmed the
award upon a writ of certiorari authorized by state statute. The state supreme court, in the exercise of its discretion, declined to review the judgment; and the case is

298

properly here on certiorari to the state circuit court.
American Ry. Express Co. -v. Levee,, 263 U. S. 19, 20;
Western Union Tel. Co. v. Crovo, 220 U. S. 364, 366.
The contention that Thomas was employed in interstate commerce at the time of the injury, rests upon the
decis'ions of this court in Erie R. Co. v. Collins, 253 U. S.
77, and Erie R. Co. v..Szary, 253 U. S. 86. In the Collins
cas6 the employee, at the time of his injury, was operating
a gasoline engine to pump water into atank for the use of
locomotives engaged in both interstate and intrastate
commerce. In the Szary case the duty of the employee
was to, dry sand by the application of heat for the use of
locomotives operating in both kinds of commerce; and he
was so employed when'injured. In each case this court
held that the employee was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injuy, within the terms of the
Federal Employers' Liabiiliy Act. '
The only difference between those cases- and this one is
'that here the work of the employee related- to coal, while
in the Collins case it related to watkr, and in the Szary
case, to sand. . Obviously, the difference is not one of substance and if the Collins and Szary cases are followed ar
reversal of the judgment below would result. '

But in Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington, 241
U. S. 177, the injured employee was engaged in taking
coal from storage tracks to bins or chutes for the use of
locomotives used in the movement of both interstate and
intiastate traffic; and this court held that.the service wAs
not in interstate commerce. 'After quoting the test. for
determining,whether an employee is engaged in interstate commerce, laid down in Shanks v. Delaware, L. &
W. B. Co., 239 U. S. 556, 558, namely, "was the employ6
at the time of the'injury engaged i interstate transporta,tion or in work so closely related to it as to be practically
a part of it," this court said (p. 180), "Manifestly, there

was no such close or direct relation to interstate transpor-.
tation in the taking of the coal to the coal chutes. This
was nothing more than the putting of the coal supply
in a convenient place from which it could be taken as
required for use."
We are unable to reconcile this decision with the rule
deducible from the Collins and Sgary cases, and-it becomes
our duty to determine which is authoritative. From a
reading of the opinion in the Collins case, it is apparent
that the test of the Shanks case was not followed (see
p. 85), the words "interstate commere" being inadvertently substituted for the words "interstate transportation" The Szary case is subject to the same criticism,
since it simply followed the Collins case. Both cases are
out of harmony with the general current of the decisions
of this court since the Shanks case, Chicago & North
Western R21. Co. v. Bolls, ante, p. 74, and they are now
definitely overruled. The Harringtoncase furnishes the
correct rule, and, applying it, the judgnent below must be
Afirmed.
