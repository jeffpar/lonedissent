delivered the, opinion of

the Court.
This action was brought -in the Federal .District!Court
for the Distrikt of Minnesota under the Federal Employ,ers'Liability-Act to recover damages for the death Of the
plaintiffs intestate. . Upon obtaining a verdict, the plaintiff asked for an order allowing fees for expert witnesses
who had testified at the 'trial. The application was made.
under the following provision of the Minnesota statutes
(Mason's Minn. Stat. 1927, § 7009):.
"Expert Witnesses.-The judge of any court of record, before whom any witness is summoned or sworn and

examined as an expert in any profession or calling, may,
in his discretion, allow such fees or compensation as in
his judgment may be just and reasonable."
'Under this statute it appears to be the practice of the
state courts of Minnesota to allow reasonable fees of expert witnesses, which are included in the taxable costs
and become part of the judgment. The allowance is in
the discretion of the trial court. Farmer v. Stillwater
Water Co., 86 Minn. 59; 90 N. W. 10; Melanderv. County
of Freeborn, 170 Minn. 378, 381; 212 N. W. 590, 591.
The District Court denied the application for *ant of
power under the federal statute§.. The Circuit Court of
Appeals, having the judgment before it on appeal, has
certified to this Court the following question:
"Has a United States District Court power and authority to allow expert witness fees, and to include the same
as part of the taxable costs in a law case, said United
States District Court being for and sitting in a State the
Courts of which are by a state statute authorized, in their
discretion, to allow expert witness fees, and the practice
and usage in said state courts being to make such allowances and to include the same in the taxable costs, but
there being no such usage and practice in said United
States District Court?"
The Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat.
73, contained refprences to costs, but no fee bill. By the
Process Act of September 29, 1789, c. 21, 1 Stat. 93, it was
provided that the "rates of fees .. in the circuit and
district courts, in suits at common law," should be the
same as were "used or allowed" in state courts. This
was a,temporary act (id., 123, 191) but, under it and later
'legislation of a similar sort,. the federal system was put in•
operation. It thus became "the practical usage of the
Courts of the United States to conform to the State laws
as to costs, when no express provision has been made and

Specific provision-as to the amounts payable and taxable as witness fees was made*.by the Congress as early
as the Act of February 28, 1799, c. 19, § 6, 1 Stat.. 624,
626. See, also, Act of February 26, 1853, c. 80, § 3, 10
Stat. 161, 167; Rev. Stat. § 848. The statute now applicable is the Act of April 26, 1926, c. 183, 44, Stat. 323.
U. S. C. Tit. 28, §§ 600a to 600d.1 Under these provisions,
additional amounts paid as compensation, or, fees, to expert witnesses cannot be allowed or taxed as costs in cases
in the federal courts. The William B ranfoot, 52 -Fed. 390,
395; In, re CarolinaCooperage Co., 9,6 Fed. 604, 605; Bone
v. Walsh Construction Co., 235 Fed. 901, 903, 904; Cheatham Electric-Co. v. Transit Development Co., 261 Fed.

The appellant, seeking the application of the statute
of Minnesota, invokes the rule that "the laws of the. sevSections 600a and 600c are as follows: ' '
"600a. Per-diem; mileage. That . .. witnesses (other than witnesses who are salaried, employees of the Government, 'and detained

eral States, except Where' the Constitution, -treaties or
statutes of the United States otherwise require or provide,
shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common
law; in the courts of the United States in cases where
they aVply." U. S. C., Tit. 28, § 725. But this provision,
by its terms, is inapplicable, as the Congress has definitely
prescribed its own requirement with respect to the fees
of witnesses. The Congress has dealt with the subject
comprehensively and has made no exception. of the fees
of expert witnesses. Its legislation must be deemed controlling *andexcludes the application in the federal courts
of any different state practice. United States v. Sanborn,
135 U. S.271, 282, 283; Northern PacificRy. Co.v. Washington, 222 U. S. 370; Second-Employers' Liability Cases,
223 U. S. 1, 55; MissouriPacific R. Co. v. Porter,273 U. S.
341, 346; Lindgren v. United States, 281 U. S.38, 45.
In Ex pare Peterson, supra, the question related to
the fees of an auditor appointed by the court, and as
the court had power to appoint him, and there was no

statute or rule of court on the subject, the court had authority to allow the expense in the items taxable as costs.
Id., pp. 314, 317. The case of People of "SiouxCounty v.
National Surety Co., 276 U. S. 238, was an action upon
a surety bond. A Nebraska statute provided that in
specified classes of cases, -including that before the court,
returning from the same $2, aid 5 cents per mile for going from his
or her place of residence to the place of trial or hearing and 5 cents
per mile for returning; And provided further, That witnesses (other
than witnesses who are salaried employees of the Government and
detained witnesses) in the United States courts, . ...who attend
court . . .at points so far removed from their respective residences
as to prohibit return thereto from day to day, shall, when this fact
is certified to in the order of the court . ..for payment, be entitled:
in addition to the compensation provided by existing law, as modified
by sections 600a to 600d of this title, to a per diem of $3 for expenses
of subsistence for each day of actual attendance and for each day
necessarily occupied in traveling to attend court and return home,"

Syllabus.

284 U. S.

the plaintiff on obtaining judgment should be allowed
a reasonable sum as an attorney's fee. The requirement
was mandatory. This court held that in such a case the
attorney's fee was recoverable in the federal court, but
was careful to point out that the amount was "not costs
in the ordinary sense" and hence was "not within the
field of costs legislation" covered by the federal statutes.
In this view, the fact that the amount could not be taxed
as costs in the federal courts did not preclude the recovery. "Since the right exists," said -the Court, "the
federal courts may follow their own appropriate procedure for its enforcement by including the amount of
the fee in the judgment." Id.j p. 244.
The present case is simply one of the amount to be
allowed as witness fees, to be included in the taxable costs,
and the federal satute governs.
The question certified is answered

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR- THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 332. Argued January 13, 14, 1932.-Decided February 15, 1932.
1. One who sues in a federal court of equity to-enjoin infringement of
his patent, thereby submits himself to the jurisdiction of that court
with respect to all the issues in the case, including those pertaining
to a counterclaim praying that he be restrained from infringing the
like patent of the defendant. P. 451.
2. A decree of the District Court perpetually enjoining a party from
infringing a patent binds him personally and continuously throughout the United States; and his disobedience of the prohibition is a
contempt even though committed outside of the district of the

court. Id.
3. A court which has permanently enjoined a party from infringing a

patent, retains jurisdiction to enforce obedience through civil contempt proceedings. P. 452.
