Syllabus.

"The State cannot cornpel the government of the United
States to pay the taxes or the penalty, but it has a lien on
the property, which should have been assessed, to secure
payment of the taxes," and declared that the penalty is
not one where the element of punishment predominates.
Our decisions in MissouriPacific R. Co. v. Ault, 256 U. S.
554, and Norfolk-Southern R. Co. v. Owens, 256 U. S. 565,
cited by appellants do not apply here. The judgment, as
construed by the court of appeals, is a lien upon the railroad properties in respect of which the franchise taxes are
collected but does not require payment of the taxes or
-penalty by the Director General or the United States.

No. 62. Argied November 25, 1931.-Decided January 4, 1932.
1. A corporation which, under the Revenue Act of- 1918, § 212 (b),
should have returned its income in .1918-1920 for its fiscal years
ending June 30, in accordance with its books of account, mistakenly
made returns.and payments for the calendar years. Throughout
the taxable periods, the total paymenti always exceeded the total
taxes due, computed, as the statute reijuired, on the basis of the
taxpayer's fiscal years. The right to recover the excess turned on
-whether or not it was paid for a period bringing. it within the
applicable period of limitation. Held:
(1) The object of the payment in each instance is defined by- .
the intention of-the taxpayer, to be ascertained from all relevant
facts, including his return. P. 3.47.
(2) Inasmuch as the return and payment. for 1918 disclose' an

,the Admitted overpayment wask of the .tax due and payable for petitioner's fiscal year ending June 30, 1918, so
that the bar of the statute had fallen at the t-ime of the
claim for refund, or was of taxes on income for the fiscal
period ending June 30, 1920, and, if the latter, whether
recovery was barred by the statute of -limitations.
Petitioner filed income tax returns for the calendar
years 1918, 1919, and 1920, although in each of those
years it, had kept its books on the basis of a fiscal -year
ending June 30th. 'By § 212 (b) of the Revenue' Act of
1918, c., 18, 40 Stat. 1057; 1064, returns were required to
be made on the basis of the fiscal'year, as shown by the
taxpayer's books of account, and-under the applicable section and regulation petitioner was required to file a return
for the six months ending June 30, 1918, and for the years
ending- on June, 30, 1919 and 1920.. § 226, 40 Stat. 1057,

petitioner was authorized-by the statute to make for the
year 1918 was for the six months, January 1st to June
30th, -petitioner's return for the calendar. year can be
given effect only as a return for that six months, and
payments of the tax as returned must be deemed, as the
Court -of Claims held, to be on account of the tax due
for the six months; with a consequent .overpajrment -for
that period in the sum of $538,202.77. Of this overpayment, $94,835.16 has been refunded, and, as petitioner concedes, recovery of the $443,367.61 balance .is
barred by the statiite of limitations if it be treated as an
overpayment attributable to that period.
The petitioner insists that the amount paid as tax for
each of. the calendar years 1918 and 1919, should be divided and one-half applied to payment of. the tax due-'
for, the fiscal period ending June 30th and one-half to
payment of the tax due for the following fiscal year, the
first six months of which were the last six months of the
calendar year for which the tax Was paid. This would
result in an underpayment for the six months e6iding
June 30, 1918, of $84,932.85, collection of which is barred
by the statute; in an overpayment for the year ending
June 30, 1919, of $66,380.91, reclaim of which is also
barred by the statute; and in an overpayment for the
year ending June 30, 1920, of $556,754.70, for-which claim
for refund was filed September 15, 1925, and for recovery of Which the present suit wag brought.

AMERICAN HIDE & L. CO. v. U. S.
343

Opinion of the Court.

We think that neither the Government nor the petitioner has chosen the correct method of restating the
account. At the outset it is to be observed that, throughout the taxable periods in question, the total payments
made by the taxpayer always exceeded the total taxes due,
computed, as the statute required, on the basis of the taxpayer's fiscal years; and the right to recover the excess
payment turns on whether it was paid for a period bringing it withizi or without the applicable period of limitation. 'The periods for which the several payments by
petitioner were made are not necessarily the sam'e as petitioner's fiscal years, for which the statute required returns.
The object of the payment is in each instance defined b"
the intention of the taxpayer, to be ascertained from all
the relevant facts and circumstances. To determine petitioner's intention, we may look at the returns which it
filed, -even though they nistakenly embraced a period
which did not coincide,'with the fiscal period for which-a.
return was prescribed.
The return made for the calendar year 1918, and the
payments'of tax made in accordance with it; disclose unmistakably petitioner's intention to pay the: tax on all
income received during the' calendar Year 1918. Of the
total income thus received, only that of the first six months
was, under the statute,, taxable in that year. Hence, the
payment of taxes on the income for the entire y.ear resulted in an overpayment of the tax-accrued in the first
six months in the sum of $538,202.77. But this is not, as
the Government contends, to be regarded as an overpayment only of tax due' for the first six months of 1918.
True, the taxpayer was required to make a return and pay
taxes for that six months, and was not authorized to make
any other return, but it did in fact make a return of its
income and pay taxes for the entire calendar year and
thus evidenced its intention to include in the return, and
pay taxes uponi, income accruing.in the last, as well as

348

Opinion of the 'Court.

the first, six months of the calendar year. Thus, when
the taxpayer had completed its payments of taxes-for the
entire year, -theywere enough to pay in full the tax due,
and payable for the six months ending June 30, 1918, and
in addition to pay the- sum of $538,202.77 on account of
the tax on income accrued in the remaining six months
of the year for which the payment was made. But as
those six months were embraced in the fiscal period ending June 30, 1919, which for purposes of assessing and
paying- the tax the statute, treats as a unitthe overpayment must necessarily be treated as apayment on account
of the tax accruing for that period.
For the calendar "year-'1919 the same considerations
govern. The overpayment last referred to, applicable on,
account of taxes due. for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1919, was not sufficient to pay the entire -tax, aggregating
$896,314.83, which the Commissioner, assessed for that
period. But the'-payments for the calendar year 1919,
when added to this overpayment, exceeded the tax ass6ssed for. the fiscal year ending in June by a sum amountjing, after deduction of refunds since made, to $443,367.61.
As in the case of the tax paid for 1918, that paid bypetitioner for 1919 was not for the fiscal, but for the calendar
year. Consequently, the payment in excess of the tax
due and payable for t~e period ending June 30, 1919, Was
in fact and in law a payment in advance on account of thetax upon income for the ensuing taxableperiod, the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1920. As upon recomputation of
the tax none was found due for that fiscal year, this pay'ment -in advance became an overpayment, when the tax
for that period was assessable, which the petitioner is
entitled-to recover unless barred by the statute of limitations.
Section 284 (b) (1) of the Revenue Act of 1926,.-c. 27,
44 Stat. 9, 66, provides that no refund shall'be nade after
four years from the time the, tax is-paid unless within
that period a claim for refund is filed by the taxpayer.
-

Opinion~of the Court.

But by -§284 (h) it is provided that that section-shall not
"bar from allowance a claim in respect of a tax for the
taxable year 1919 or 1920, if such claim is filed before the
expiration of five years after the date the return was due."
As the petitioner's tax payments for the entire period .un-t
der consideration were' completed in December, 1920, its
claim for refund, filed September 15, 1925, was not within
the four year period, and its right to recover is barred unless September 15, 1925' the date the claim was filed, was'
before the expiration of "five years after the daite the
return' was due," as provided by paragraph (h). The
claim was in time. only if, as petitioner 'contends, the return was due September 15; 1920, which is'Lhe date fixed
by §,227"of the -1918 Act forfiling petitioner's return for
thefiscal year ending June 30th. See Burnet v. WiUingham Loan & Trust Co., -282 U. S. 437.
On its face, § 284 (h), which specifically refers to a
claim-for a refund" of a tax for the taxable year... 1920,"
and bars i" if not filed within five yeas after the return
was due,' would seem to 'refer to the time fixed by the
statute.for return of hicome for the taxable year for which
.the tax was -]aid, which, in. this-case, was,Septeiber 15,
'1920. "But the Govemlent, notwithstanding its argu-mqnt that the xeturn for petitioner's fiscal year is the
only one referred to or authorized by § 212 of the 1918
Act, insists that the wors "date the return was due'
-in.§ 284 (h). of. the 1926 Act refer to the return which the
taxpayer in fact filed-for'the calendar year 1910, which,
under the applipable section, § 227 of the 1918 Act, was
due. on March1, 1920. In supportof this contention it.
points to the language of § 252'of the 1918 Act, in which
the quoted words first occurred. In that section they
were preceded by. a provision requiring credit or refund
"if, upon examination of any return," an overpayment
appeared. From this it is argued that the'proviso in -the
same section that iefund should not be.allowed unless
claim was made within five years from the " date the

return was due," refers to the -due date of the return
actually filed and not the due date of the return required
by the statute.
But it is to.be noted that the reference, in § 252 of
the 1918 Act, to an examination of the return, which
was continued in § 252 of the 1921 Act, c- 136, 42 Stat.
27, 268, was dropped from the corresponding § 281 of
the Act of i924 and the applicable § 284 of the Act of.
1926. Both of these sections provide for refund or credit
of any overpayment of the tax, and specific reference to
the taxable year 1920 was inserted in the proviso that the
section should not bar claims for overpayment of "a tax
for he taxable year 1919 or 19,20" if "filed before expiration of five years after the date'the return was due."
Whatever the meaning of "return as used in the earlier
sections, we. think it reasonably clear that the omission
by the later ones of all reference to the return actually
filed and the insertion of a reference to the taxable!year,
in juxtaposition to the phras "five years after the date
the return was due,? evidenced' an intention that the date
from which the statute is to run should be the due date
of the return required by the statute for the taxable
year.
There is no basis for the contention of petitioner that the
4,axes paid for each calendar year should be divided and.
.,one-half applied to tax due for the first six months and
one-half for tax accruing in the last six months of the
year. ' We think neither the circumstances nor the applicable statute permits such an allocation. 'Section 226 of
the 1918 Act authorizes the calculation of the tax for that
'Such a prorating of tax payments in order to allocate taxes, erroneously paid for a calendar year, to the portions of the two fiscal years
which make up the calendar year was allowed by the Board of Tax

part of a fiscal year falling between the beginning of the
calendar year and the end of the fiscal year by the apportionment of gross income and deductions for th fiscal
year, pro rata to the taxable fiscal period, in -order to
arrive at net income for the latter. See Appeal of Weed,
2 B. T; A. 84. But the section does not authorize a like
apportionment of the tax paid for the caleildar year, and
none was made by the returns which petitioner filed. The
tax paid was for the income of the entire 'year and was
obviously intended to be applied to the payment'of any
tax due or payable in that year, which would include all
the tax accruing for the fiscal lperiod ending June 30th.
Under § 252 of fhe Revenue Act of 1918, petitioner could
not at any time have claimed a refund of any overpayment of tax except such amount as was "in excess of that
properly due" for. the first six months, and since the
excess, as already indicated, was, in each year, paid on
account of the calendar year, a part of which fell within
the fiscal period following June 30th, a correct statement
of the account requires the overpayment .tobe credited to
that rather than the preceding fiscal period.
It follows that recovery should be .allowed of the
amount of.the overpayment not already refunded, which,
as stated, is $443,367.61, with interest computed in accordance with the applicable statutes, and that the judgment
should be reversed and -the cause remanded for further
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.'
The amounts of the tax computed by the Commissioner
and the amount of .the overpayment as stated in this
opinion are those shown by the findings of the Court of
Claims, but the mandate of this 'Court will b without
prejudice to any restatement. of the amount of overpayment based on a recomputation of the tax.*
