AMERICAN SURETY CO. v. GREEK CATHOLIC
UNION.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT 6F APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 401.

Argued January 22, 1932.-Decided February 15, 1932.

A surety company executed in favor of a benefit society a fidelity
bond conditioned upon the faithful performance of the duties of its
-treasurer. - He subsequently violated his duty by depositing with a
bank a sum greatly in excess of that permitted by the by-laws of
his organization. The bank came into financial difficulty, and its
assets .were taken over and its liabilities assumed by a trust company. To assure the transfer, and in an attempt to minimize the
loss, but without the consent of the surety company, the society
entered into an agreement with the trust company to leave on deposit with it a sum of money, for a stated period, without interest.At the expiration of this'period the money was paid back in full.
The society sued the surety company to recover a sum representing
the amount of interest lost on the money as a result of these arrangements. It was admitted that the course pursued by the
society had deprived the surety company of its right of subrogation
agaipst the bank. Held:
1. The agreement made between the society and the trust company so varied the risk as to release the surety company from
liability under its bond. P. 567.
2. The surety company did- not have the burden of proving
affirmatively that its risk was increased. Pp. 568-569.
3. The cause of the loss sued for was the voluntary action of the
society in making an entirely new agreement with the trust .company, and this was not one of the events specified in the bond on
which payment was conditioned. P. 569.

Messrs. James M. Magee and Edmund W. Arthur for
petitioner.
Messrs. Thomas Stephen Brown and Ralph C. Davis for
respondent.
*.M. JusTicE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The petitioner executed in favor of the respondent a
bond in the sum of $100,000 conditioned upon the payment of pecuniary loss the corporation should sustain
through the failure of one Kondor, its treasurer, faithfully
to perform his duties as prescribed by the constitution and
by-laws, or through his failure to keep intact and absolutely to account for all funds of the corporation. Kondor
violated his duty by depositing with the Peoples State
Bank of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, of which he was president, a sum greatly in excess of that permitted by the
by-laws to be lodged in any one depositary. The bank
became embarrassed and the state banking department
instituted an investigation of its affairs. The amount on
deposit to the credit of respondent was found to be over
$241,000; and checks for $89,000 had been prepared for
signature by Kondor as treasurer and were about to be
issued. The representatives of the state determined that
if these checks were issued and presented for payment
they could not be met out of the bank's available resources
and the institution would have to be closed and place I in
the hands of an official liquidator.
News of the situation reached certain executive officers
of the Union who lived in Pittsburgh, and they came to

Johnstown with their attorneys, They were informed
that unless $100,000 additional cash was deposited with
the bank the state would not permit the institution to
honor the checks for $89,000. In this exigency counsel
for the respondent called up an official of the petitioner
at Pittsburgh and was advised by him that he had no
authority to act in the premises. The only one to whom
he could refer counsel was the general claim agent of the
petitioner, who lived in New York. When reached by
telephone he stated that he had no authority to pay or
deposit $100,000, that such a matter would have to be
referred to the executive committee. He was told that
negotiations were under way to have another bank or
trust company in Johnstown take over the assets and liabilities of the Peoples Bank, that a definite arrangement
would have to be reached in less than twenty-four hours,
and that the petitioner should have someone representing
it come at once to Johnstown to join in the conferences on
this subject. It does not appear that a promise was made
that any such person could or would arrive in time to take
part in the matter. This conversation took place on a
Sunday morning. Late the same night a contract was
entered into between the Peoples State Bank and the
United States Trust Company of Johnstown whereby the
latter assumed all the liabilities of the bank, except for
its capital stock, in consideration -of the conveyance of
all its -assets. The trust company was unwilling to make
this agreement unless respondent would stipulate to leave
with it $200,000 of the existing deposit with the bank
for four years without interest. To assure the consummation of the transfer the respondent executed such an
undertaking. The trust company proceeded with the
liquidation of the affairs of the former bank, paid checks
for some $41,000 of the deposit, standing to the credit of
the respondent, and at the expiration of the stipulated

four year period paid the respondent" the remaining
$200,000.
Respondent brought this action, alleging Kondor's
breach of duty under the by-laws and his failure to keep
intact the moneys entrusted to him as treasurer, and the
consequent liability of petitioner on its bond. The declaration detailed the facts we have summarized, asserted
due notice of breach to the surety; and its failure to meet
the accruing liability; recounted the arrangement made
in order to save loss, and claimed some $41,000 of interest
lost to the corporation by reason of Kondor's default and
the resulting agreement with the United States Trust
Company made. necessary thereby. The -amount demanded was made up by showing that for four years
$200,000 of the respondent's moneys 'had yielded no income, and that in conformity with the by-laws all of
these funds would have been promptly invested except
for Kondor's default; .that the corporation normally
earned five per cent. on investments, and had lost the
opportunity to earn at that or any rate by reason of having to leave the $200,000 on deposit with the United
States Trust Company without interest. The petitioner
filed a statutory demurrer which was sustained by the
District Court, whose decision was overruled by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 25 F. (2d) 31, and the case remanded for further proceedings. A trial on the merits
resulted in a verdict and judgment for the amount
claimed. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 51 F.
(2d) 1050. This court granted certiorari.
At trial the court affirmed a point for charge presented
by respondent, which permitted the jury to find whether
the arrangement entered into between respondent and the
United States Trust Company created a material variation of the surety's risk. Petitioner presented a point to
the effect that the agreement with the trust company
created a material variance in the contract of suretyship,

deprived the surety of recovery of salvage from the
Peoples State Bank, and relieved the petitioner of the
burden of showing that the variance was prejudicial. This
was refused.
The parties agree that Kondor's conduct -withrespect to
the deposit in the Peoples State Bank was a breach of his
obligations and entailed a liability upon the bond;. that
the ascertainment of Kondor's defaults and notice thereof
to the surety matured the surety's obligation to pay the
loss sustained up to $100,000; that if petitioner had made
such payment it would have been entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the respondet against the Peoples
State Bank and Kondor, and thA *thecourse adopted by
the officers of the Union deprived the surety of any opportunity to pursue the Peoples State Bank. In its brief and
at bar respondent conceded that the telephone conversations with petitioner's employees on the eve of entering
into the agreement with the United States Trust Com.pany in no way affected the reciprocal rights and liabilities
consequent on Kondor's defaults. These agreements and
concessions narrow the issue presented to the question
whether the arrangements made and approved by the
officers of the obligee so-varied thie-risk as to release the
obligor from liability under its bond. The court below
was of opinion the exigency which confronted the Union's
officers was similar to one which an insured faces when a
fire occurs, and the efforts at salvage ought niot to be held
a prejudicial variation" of the hazard; that the burden
rested upon petitioner affirmatively to prove that what
was done increased its risk, and that the trial judge
properly left this question as one of fact to the jury. with this view. Assuming that. re-.

Co., 191,U. -S. 416, 423), and that consequently a variation of the risk does not ipso facto discharge the insurer,
who in order to escape liability must prove that the
change was material and prejudicial, it remains, as a practical matter, that what was done made proof of actual
detriment impossible. If the bank had been closed, the
surety would have remained liable for the penal sum
named in the bond; and upon payment thereof would
have been subrogated to the respondent's rights against
the bank and the defaulting treasurer. .Whether the resulting loss would have been more than $41,000 no one
can tell. The state authorities, from such examination
as they had made, were of the opinion that the depositary
might pay from twenty to forty per cent. of its liabilities. It appears, however, that by the administration of
the United States Trust Company the' debts have been
paid almost in full, and some assets of doubtful value remain to be converted. The action of the Union's officials
has placed the question of probable prejudice due to the
adoption of one of the two alternatives presented wholly
in the realm of conjecture, and respondent now seeks
to cast upon petitioner the burden of proving the consequences of an event which never in fact occurred.
The cases relied on by respondent have to do with an
alteration of the terms of a principal obligation -prior
to any breach, and without the surety's consent. They
address themselves to the question whether-such a change
discharges the indemnitor from liability consequent upon
a breach. Young v. American Bonding Co., 228 Pa. 373;
77 Atl. 623;. Philadelphiav. Fidelity & Deposit Co., 231

ligee, without consulting the surety, entered into a -wholly
new arrangement relative to the recoupment of such loss.
The claim is that this action was in fact in the -interest
of the surety and saved it money, and that if this is not
true, the surety must assume the burden of proving what
would have been the result of refraining from the attempt
to minimize loss. We are referred to no authority in support of this position, and -we think it unsound as applied
even to the case of a paid surety company, which is often
treated as an insurer merely.
Viewed in another aspect, the facts preclude a recovery. The cause and genesis of the loss was not one
of the events specified in the bond on which -payment was
conditioned. The defaults for which the petitioner
agreed to be liable were clearly defined. The bond guaranteed against fraud, dishonesty, forgery, theft, etc. of
the treasurer; against his neglect- faithfully to perform
his duties as prescribed by the constitution and by-laws;
against his omission to keep intact and absolutely to
account for all the funds of the corporation;*and against
the failure of any bank or trust company in which he
might deposit such funds. There i6 no evidence that
the loss occurred through the fraud, dishonesty, or forgery
of Kondor. It did not arise from the failure of the depositary, for the bank was not allowed to fail. The
breach for which indemnity was to be afforded was Kondor's default in the performance of his duties and" with
respect to the protection of the funds of the corporation.
There is nothing in the instrument which by the farthest
stretch of construction can be said to undertake the payment of a loss due to an agreement of the corporation to
substitute some other bank or trust company for the
Peoples Bank. The. voluntary action of the respondent
in making an entirely new agreement, whereby in effect
it loaned $200,000 to the United States Trust Company
for four'years without interest, caused the loss for which

the suit is brought. In view of the situation confronting it the Union thought well to incur the risk of losing
that interest. It cannot now ask that the bond be rewritten to cover an event not therein specified or contemplated. Where an insured without the agreement of
the insurer undertakes to substitute a new obligation
under a new agreement with a third party in-lieu of 'those
arising from a breach of the officer Whose fidelity is insured, thus substituting a new and different liability
from any undertaken in the instrument of suretyship, and
depriving the insurer of the right of subrogation, such
conduct operates to discharge the obligation of the indemnity contract.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUsTICE McREYNOLDS is of the opinion that the

judgment should be affirmed.
