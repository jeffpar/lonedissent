HANDY & HARMAN v. BURNET, COMMISSIONER
OF INTERNAL REVENUE.
CERTIOPAMRI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 14. Argued October 19, 1931.-Jecided November 23, 1931.
Section 240 of the Revenue Act of 1918 provides that "affiliated"
corporations shall make a consolidated return of net income and
invested capital; and domestic corporations shall be deemed affiliated if substantially all their stock "is owned or controlled by the
same interests." Held:
.1. That the purpose was to require taxes to be levied according to the true net income andicnvested capital resulting from and
emplodyed in a single business enterprise, even though it were conducted by means of more than one corporation, and to secure substantial equality as between shareholders. who ultimately bear the
burden. P. 140.
2. Such returns 'iill not make against inequality or evasion unless
the same interests are the beneficial owners in like proportions of
substantially all of the stock of-each of such corporations; an indefinite anduncertain control .of stock, without title, beneficial
ownership or legal means to enf6rce it, but. resting solely on acquiescerce, the exigencies of business or other considerations having no
binding force, is not sufficient. P. 141.
47 F. (2d) 184, affirmed.

Mr. William C. Breed for petitioner.
Where two or more corporations are operating as a
business and economic unit, actual control of the stock
of the minority is sufficient whether or not based upon
legally enforceable means. Kile & Morgan Co. .v. Cornmissioner, 41 F. (2d) 925; J. Rogers Flannery & Co. v.

The word "controlled" as it appears in the statute is
unqualified. The court below, in restricting that word to
a control based upon legally enforceable means, refused to
give to it its accepted meaning and made it practically
synonymous with the -word "owned." Statutory words
are presumed to be used in their ordinary sense. The
legislature is presumed to have used no superfluous wordsr
and every word in a statute must be accorded a meaning,.
In construing taxing statutes, it is most important that
they be given their literal meaning. United States v.
Merriam, 263 U. S. 179, 187; Lynch v. Alworth-Stepheni
Co., 267 U. S. 364, 370.
The legislative history of the Act furnishes abundant
evidence that Congress used these words in their broad
and natural sense.
Assistant Attorney General Youngquist, with whom
Solicitor General Thacher and Messrs. Whitney North
Seymour, Sewall Key, and John H. McEvers were on the
brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Petitioner claims that it and Hamiltofi & DeLoss, Inc.,
were affiliated corporations as defined'by § 240 of the
Revenue Act of 1918 and that it is entitled to have its
.net income and invested capital for 1918 and the first
month of 1919 determined on the basis of consolidated
returns. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue held

them not affiliated, rejected petitioner's claim for abatement for 1918 and asserted a deficiency .for 1919. The
Board of Tax Appeals approved the Commissioner's detep.ination (17,B.-T. A. 980) and upon petition for review-the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 47 F. (2d)
184. That decision being in conflict with decisions of
other Circuit Courts of Appeals,' this Court granted
certiorari. 283 U. S.813.
The pertinent provisions of the section follow (40 Stat.
1081):
"§ 240 (a). That corporations which are affiliated
within the meaning of this section shall, under regulations
to be prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval
of the Secretary, make a consolidated return, of net income and invested capital for the purposes of this title
[Title II] and Title III, and the taxes thereunder shall
be computed and determined upon the basis of such
return: ...
"(b). For the purpose of this section'two or more
domestic corporations shall be deemed to be affiliated...
(2) if substantially all the stock of two or more corporations is owned or controlled by the same interests."
Petitioner carried on the business of dealing in gold and
silver bullion and specie and furnishing to silversmiths
silver rolled into sheets or coils. In 1916 its officers caused
Hamilton & DeLoss, Inc., to be organized, to erect a
factory and to take over the work of its stamping depart'Ice Serviqe Co. v. Commissioner, 30 F. (2d) 230, and Commissioner v. Adolph Hirsch & Co. 30 F. (2d) 645. (C. C. A-.)

Opinion of the Court.

ment. During the taxable periods six men owned 93,71
per cent. of the stock of petitioner. The same men owned
over 75 per cent. of the stock of Hamilton & DeLoss, Ind.
Hamilton did not own or conitrol any of the stock of
petitioner. Twenty per cent. of the stock of the new company Was issued to him and he became its president. He
gave to a bank his notes endorsed by DeLoss to obtain
money to pay for the stock. Before the beginning of. 1918
he executed an irrevocable stock power to one Higgins,
and the latter, by like instrument, assigned the stock to
DeLoss, who deposited' it with the bank as collateral
security -or the paymrent -of Hamilton's notes. Hamilton
failed to pay and, February 1, 1919,. after the expiration of
the tax periods, DeLoss paid the notes and took over the
stock.
Prior to that time Hamilton attended all-the stockholders' meetings but never voted in opposition .to 'the
owners of 'the majority stock of both corporations.
Hamilton & DeLoss, Inc.,.paid him a salary at the rate of
$10,000 per year, but the other officers of that corporation,
being officers, directors or employees of the petitioner,
received their compensation from the latter, although a
large part of their time was devoted to the business of
the former. During the taxable periods the corporations
were operated as a business unit, and Hamilton & DeLoss,
Inc., sustained a net loss.
It may be assumed that the pledge as collateral was also
to protect DeLoss as endorser. But it does not appear
.that, as between him and Hamilton.,. he was entitled to
control voting power, or to have the stock transferred to
him of record, or to have any use or benefit therefrom
unless and until required to pay the notes. It was not
held by or for him. The losses sustained by Hamilton &
DeLoss, Inc., did not, in respect of that stock, directly
or indirectly result to his disadvantage. The section requires control of substantially all of the stock; control of

the corporations is not enough.2 The carrying on of a
business unit by two or more corporations- does not in
itself constitute affiliation. The shares of Hamilton &
DeLoss, Inc., owned by the six shareholders did not constitute substantially all of its stock.' We assume in
favor of petitioner that they, through their power over
Ha~a"lfn's official position and salary, their ability to
domiriate both corporations or by other means, were in
ppositiofi effectually to influence him in respect of the voting, use or disposition of the stock issued to him, and thus
as a practical matter to exert a kind of control called by.
counsel "actual" to distinguish it from a legally enforce-able control..
..The purpose of § 240 was, by means of consolidated
returns, to require taxes-to be levied according to the true
net income and invested capital resulting-from and em'ployed in a single business 6nterprise, even though it was
conducted by means of more than one corporation. Subsection (b) clearly reflects the Intention, by means of such
Teturns, to secure substantial equality as between share.holders who ultimately bear the burden. That intention
,is shown by the legislative history and was given effect by
the regulations contemporaneously promulgated. It re2It was;so held in I!e Service Co. v. Commissione, 30 F. (2d) 230,

make against inequality or evasion. It w6uld require very
plain language to show that Congress intended to permit
consolidated returns to depend on a basis so indefinite and
uncertain as control of stock without title, beneficial ownership or legal means to enforce it. Control resting solely
on acquiescence, the exigencies of business or other con-.
siderations having no binding force is not sufficient to satisfy the statute..
