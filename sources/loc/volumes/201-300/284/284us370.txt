we thinkfhat it did so. The Court there held that, in the
issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity,
the Commission need not determine with mathematical
exactness the extent of the burden imposed upon interstate commerce by the operation of a branch line; that
such burden might involve various elements, and that
if upon the whole proof the conclusion was warranted that
continued operation would in fact unreasonably burden
the interstate commerce of the carrier, the Commission
was justified in authorizing abandonment. There, as
here, the system lay wholly within the state and was prosperous, and no claim was made that immediate abandonment of the local branch was necessary to enable the car'
rier to earn a reasonable return on its investment. Here,
as in the Colorado case, the Commission had regard for
the needs of intrastate as well as interstate commerce.
The evidence was ample to give a comprehensive view of
the entire situation, and due weight was accorded all of
the proofs in the light of the conflicting requirements.
The contention that the Commission went upon the
theory that it might authorize abandonment in disregard
of the evidence is not supported by the record. The judgment must be

the payment of reparation measured by what the Commission now
holds it should have decided in the earlier proceedings to be a
reasonable rate. Pp. 383-390.
2. When the Commission by its authority under the Tfansportation
Act declares a specific rate to be the reasonable and lawful rate
for the future, it exercises a legislative function and its pronouncement has the force of a statute. This is well established as to the
fixing of specific rates by state commissions, and in this respect
there is no difference between authority delegated by a state legislature and that conferred by Congress. P. 386.
3. When the- Commission, fixes a maximum rate, or maximum and
minimuni rates, the carrier is not obliged at its peril to see that
the rates it maintains within the limits so authorized are reasonable. Pp.. 386, 387.
4. In declaring a maximum rate the Commission exercises a delegated power legislative in character, and may act only within the
scope of the delegation; its authority is to fix a maximum reasonable
rate, and. it is precluded by the statute from fixing one which is
unreasonable. P. 387.

Argument for Petitioner.

284 U.S.

Messrs. Frank L. Snell, Jr., and R. C. Fulbright,with
whom Mr. Samuel White was on the' brief, for petitioner.
The Interstate Commerce Act confers jurisdiction upon
the Commission to award reparation against rates which
were charged under an order prescribing a maximum rate
if the rate charged was in fact unreasonable.
. Section 15 (1) provides that the Commission may prescribe four types of rates: (1) just and reasonable; (2)
maximum; (3)" minimum; and (4) maximum and minimum.
A maximum rate is not necessarily a just and reasonable rate. The' fact that the Commission prescribed a
maximum rate does not relieve the carrier of the duty
to file and publish a reasonable rate. That duty is a continuing one which must be complied with by the carriers;
otherwise the Act will be violated and the shipper entitled
to damages because of such violation. News Syndicate
Co. v. New York Cent. R. Co., 275 U. S. 179, 187.
Section 16 (1) gives the Commission the right, as a
judicial body, to act retroactively and award reparation
whenever damages arise, as provided in §§ 8 and ,9. Section 15 (2) gives it the. power to set aside a previous
order.
It is fundamental in this case that a carrier is entitled
only to a just and reasonable rate and not permitted to
charge more. Texas & Pac. Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton
Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426; Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v.
United States, 263 U. S. 456; Southern Pc,. Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Lumber. Co., 245 U. S. 531.
The shipper is compelled to pay the duly filed and
published tariff whether such^tariff is Commission-made
or railroad-made; and if it is unreasonable he must-seek
recovery before the Commission, acting as a judicial body.
To hold that the shipper would be foreolosed. in such a
.proceeding because of the prior finding and order of the
Commission acting as a legislative body, would amount

to depriving-him of his property without due process of
law, if in fact the rate charged was unreasonable.
The right to a reasonable rate is a vested property right
of the shipper.. Missouri, K..& T. R. Co. V. Interstate
Commerce Comm., 164 Fed. 645; McLean Lumber Co. v.
United States, 237 Fed. 460, 466.
The Commission, acting in 'a judicial capacity, has a
right to determine, in view of the ficts then before it,
whether the rate in question was in fact just and reasonable and inecompliance with the Act. The fact that
the rate had been previously prescribed as a maximum
rate by the Commission, acting in a legislative capacity,
,can not be conclusive in such a judicial proceeding.
Baltimore& 0.1. Co.,v. United States, 279 U. S. 781.
The only method provided by the Act for a shipper
to attack an unjust and unreasonable rate is to file a complaint before the Coiimission in accordance with §§ 9
and 13. Thelfact'that the Act'took from the shipper the,
right to a proceeding in court does not mean that the
shipper forfeited his lawful rights to a just and reasonable
rate. Only the remedy and method of procedlre were
-..
changed.

Argument for Respondents.

284 U. S

These state courts clearly point out the distinction between the Interstate Commerce Act, in which the Commission is given broad and comprehensive powers including the right to prescribe a maximum rate, and the state
acts, in which commissions are given limited and restricted
powers and the right to fix only the exact rate. Eagle
Cotton Oil Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 46 F. (2d) 1006. See
especially s. c., 51 F. (2d) 443.
The decision conflicts with the principles of interpretation and application of -the Interstate Commerce Act previously laid down by this Court. Reaganv. FarmersL. &

The rates assessed, and the charges collected, upon petitioner's shipments, were conclusively established as just
and reasonable, and in conf6rmity with the requirements
of the Act and of the Commission's valid findings and
valid continuing order. The Commission's findings and
order in the First Case were continuously in effect without modification throughout the period of movement of
petitioner's shipments, and were fully and literally complied with by the respondents.
In the very nature of things, the voluntary publication of rates less than the reasonable maximum fixed by
the Commission must have resulted in rates just as prop:.

rate, and not the exact or only rate thereafter to be
charged. Admittedly, the carriers did exactly as they
were directed. Since the greater includes the less, it follows that the resulting rates were just as completely within
the terms of the Commission's order, and thus just as
much "Commission-made," as if the 961/2 cent rate and
no other had been published. Eagle Cotton Oil Co. v.
Southern Ry. Co., 51 F. (2d) 443, is not in point upon
the issue here discussed, and does not sustain the Commission's position at all.
The findings and order in the First Case, whefeby the
rate to bNe observed in future was determined, were made
by the Commission in the exercise of its quasi-legislative
power. Prentis i Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.; 211 U. S.

Orders of the Commission. precisely similar in every
essential respect to the order in the First Case have been
held by this Coiirt and the inferior federal courts to be
orders prescribing reasonable rates. Chicago, R. I. & P.

(2d) 613; s. c., 53 I. C. C. 491.
Having been validly made, and in full force and effect
at the time petitioner's shipments moved; the findings and
order in the First Case constituted a conclusive determi-nation that the rates established and charged in compliance therewith were just and reasonable. Interstate

Charging of rates maintained and applied in conformity
with the Commission's valid outstanding findings and

The Commission's determination of the reasonableness
of a particular rate, if validly made, is absolutely conclusive. By the terms of the statute it fixes the rate " to be
thereafter observed" as long as its order is effective. Certainly if.the carrier has no option to advance a rate, except

by appr6 al of the Commission, it should not be required,
as an affirmativebbligation imposed by § 1 of the Act, voluntarily to reduce a rate below a standard set by the Commission'" fo be thereafter observed."
Philiips V. Grand. Trunk W. Ry. Co., 236 U. S. 602,
665; Mitchell Coal Co. v, Pennsylvania B. Co., 230

the Commission as to the reasonableness of. a pafti~ular
rate, when properly made a§ the fouftdation f6r, awards of
.reparation, are conclusive.and binding,. not merely upon
the shippers and carriers directly involved- in the proceeding, but upon all. shippers and carriers WAo may be
affected by th* ruling. But if such conclusive effect is
given to rulings of the Commission as .elating to past
rates, equally. its -rulings as to rates to be observed for the
future should be regarded as constituting the conclusive
measure of -the rights of the shippers, as long as those
rulings continue in effect. The carrier's obedience-to a
conclusive and continuing 0rder-prescribing the maximum
reasonable rate thereafter to be charged, necessail results in the maintenance and application of rates which,
as measured by the only final standard which the law. of
the land recogniies,. are just and, reasonable. There can
be no violation of the Act, under such circumstances; and
consequently, there is nothing to which the Commission's'
jurisdiction to award reparation may attach. Cf. Atldntic Coast Line R. Co. v. Powe, 283 U. S. 401; United States'
v.New Rive Co., 265 U. S.533, 541.
All the reported court decisions declare and sustain the
proposition that a regulatory tribunal, exercising functions
similar to those of the Interstate Commerce Commission,
cannot, award reparation -for the charging of rates which
such tribunal has itself prescribed-or approved. There is
'no reported decision boldifig to the contrary. Keogh v.

quasi-judicial power, as an agency of the judicial arm, and
not of the Congress. In so doing; it is bound by its prior
legislative 'determinations and'must act with reference
only to the law and the facts as they existed at the time

A-ument for the Commission.

Messrs. Daniel W. Knowlton and H. L. Underwood, by
special leave of Court, filed a brief on behalf of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, as amicus curiae.
Section 1 (4) requires carriers subject to the Act to
"establish ... just and reasonable rates, fares, and
charges," and § 1 (5) declares that "all charges made for
any service rendered . . .in- the transportation of . . .
piroprty . . . shall be just and reasonable," and that
"every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service
•... is prohibited and declared to be unlawful." There is
a continuing duty upon carriers to observe these mandates and the prescription of maximum rates by the Commission does not absolve them from that obligation or
authorize the continuance of a charge which'by reason of
changed conditions has become *unreasofiable and unjust.
Baer Bros. Co. v. Denver & R. G. R. Co., 233 U. S. 479.
Such an order is not res judicata. Tagg Bros. v. United
States, 280 U. S. 420, 445.
The basis upon which reparation is awarded is that a
carrier has been guilty of a violation of the Act by exaction of an unreasonable rate-a tort. Louisville &. N. R.'
Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield'Co., 269 U. S. 217, 234; Lewis-SimasJones Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., 283 U. S. 654, 660. If
the Commissicn finds the rate exacted unreasonable, it
matters not that the rate at some prior time was held to
be reasonable by the Commission.
A contrary conclusion would deny to shippers the right
to a reasonable rate during all the time the question of
reasonableness is being litigated before the Commission,
as well as prior thereto, although the Commission finds
that the rate had become and was unreasonable during the
entire period covered by the award.
In ihe present case, there are the added considerations
that the finding of the Commission as a result of which
reparation was awarded, was made upon a comprehensive
record, as distinguished from a partial one, on which the

380

prior maximum rates had been authorized, and that the
rates here involved were repeatedly under fire of the
shippers.
The action of the Commission in awarding reparation
was consistent with that in other cases.
Subsequent reduction of the rates by the voluntary action of the carriers warrants a conclusion that such reduced rates were not prescribed by the Commission.
BriA=stonteR. & C. Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. .104,. 122;
Eagle Cotton Oil Co. v: Southern Ry. Co., 51 F. (2d) 443.
When the language of § 1 (4) and (5) is contrasted with
that of § -15 (1), it will be seen that there is no duty
imposed upon the Commission such as that imposed uponthe carriers. The provisions of § 15 (1) are that the
Commission may, upon its own motion, and must, upon
complaint, inquire into the reasonableness of rates and'
prescribe reasonable rates when deemed proper. That
falls far short of making it the duty'ofthe Commission
to see that rates are kept -currently reasonable. But § 1
(4) and (5), as we have seen, does impose that duty-upon
'
the carriers. There are good reasons for this.
. We think there is'no difference, with respect to reparation, between a rate established by. thecarrier and one
established by order of the Commission. The Act makes
none. The sole question is whether,. for the period for
which reparation is sought, the rate exacted was unreasonable,: that is, has there been a violation of the Act?
Reparation is allowed for the collection by a common
carrier of exorbitant 'charges, which constitutes a tort.
Lewis-Simas-Jones Co. ,v. Southern Pac. Co.,. 283 U. S.

Line, 211 U. S. 210, 226, yet strictly spealing the rate for
the future has no relevancy to the reparation claim, since
the award of reparation is made by the Commission in its
quasi-judicial capacity to measure past injuries sustained
by a private shipper arising from a violation of the Act by
the carrier But testimony showing the unreasonableness
of a past rate may also furnish information on which to fix
a reasonable future rate, and both subjects can be, and
often are, disposed of by the same order. Baer Bros. Co.
v. Denver & R. G. 1R. Co., 233 U. S. 479, 486.
If the requirements of § 1 (5)' are kept in mind, there
can be no inconsistency in awarding, reparation for the
exaction of a "Commission - made" rate, which is in effect
the legal rate until changed, but hot necessarily the lawful
rate, if subsequently it becomes in fact unreasonable.

This case turns upon the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to award reparations'with respect to
shipments which moved under rates approved or prescribed by it.
The respondent carriers maifitained a rate of $1.045 per
hundred ppunds for shipment of.sugar from California
points to Phoenix, Arizona. On complaint of petitioner
and others, the Commission, after hearing, on June 22,

that it exceeded 96.5 cents,' and ordered the establishment

as to which it clearly appears that our pre- ious findings
would not accord substantial justice u'nder-the laws which
we administer. We have such a case here. For the first
time the record before us is comprehensive in the evidence
which it contains upon the reasonableness of the rates
assailed. Upon -this record we reach. the conclusion that
the rate prescribed in the first-Phoenix case, during the
period embraced in these complaints; was unreasonable
and that a lower rate would have been reasonable.during
that period. If .we are within our authority in finding
that -aowerrate would have been reasonable, then it must
follow that shippers who paid the freight charges at the
higher rate paid charges which were unreasonable, and are
entitled-toreparation, ...
The carriers having failed to pay the- amount awarded,
*the petitioner sued therefor in the District -Court, and

This
Court granted certiorari. Whether, as the petitioner.

and to prbvent-discrimination and other abuses, te statute required the filing and publishing of tariffs specifying
the rates adopted by the carrier, and made these the legal
rates, that is, those which'must be charged to all shippers
alike., Any deviation from the published rate was declared a criminal offense, and also a civil wrong giving rise
to an action for damages by the injured shipper.7 Although the Act thus created a; legal rate,'it did not abrogate, but expressly affirmed, the common-law duty to
.charge no more than a reasohable rate, and left upon the
carrier the burden of conforming its charges to that standard.' In other words, the legal rate was fiot~made by the
statute'alawful rate--it was lawful only if it was reasonable. Under § 6 thd shipper was bound to pay the'legal
rate; - but if lie could show tat it was-unreasonable he
might recover reparation.

of the award was relegated to the courts. In passing upon
the issue of fact the function of the Commission was judicial in character; "oits aetion affected only the past, so
far as any remedy of -the 'shipper was concerned, and
adjudged for the present merely that the rate was then
unreasonable; no authority was granted to prescribe rates
to be charged in the future. Indeed, after a finding that
an existing rate was unreasonable, the carrier might put
into effect a new and slightly differ6nt rate and compel
the shipper to resort to a new prpceedlng to have this declared un'reasqnable." Since the carrier had complete
liberty of action in making therate, it necessidly followed
that .upon a finding of unreasonableness, an award of reparation. should be measured by the excess paid, subject
only to statutory limitations of time.
Under the Act of 1887 the Commission was" with6ut
power either to prescribe a given rate thereafter t6 be
.charged (Initerstate Commerce Comm. v. Cincinnati,

for the reason that so to do would be to exercise a legislative function not delegated to that body by the

its authority.to the presdcrption of a named rate, or the
maximum or iniimum reasonable rate, or the.-maximum
and inimum'hlimits vithin which the cariners' p'ublished
rate must come. When under this mandate the ,Commission declares a specific rate to be the reasonable and

and its pronouncement has the force of a statute.

There is, however, in the case of a commission order, the additional
elemient, that the courts will examine- the -question -whether theaclministrative agency of the legislature has exceeded, its statutory powers (Skinner & Eddy Corp. v. United-States, 249 U.-S. at p. 562,. and

low. This is true because the Commission, in naming the
rate, speaks in its- quasi-legislative capacity. The prescription of a maximum rate; or maximum and minimum
rates, is as legislative in quality as the fixing of a specified
rate.
In Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love, 252-U. S. 331, 335,
it wassaid, " The'order of the Commission prohibiting the
company from charging, without its permission, rates
higher than those prevailing in 1913, in effect prescribed
maximum rates for the service. It was, therefore, a legis-:
lative order...
If by act of Congress maximum rates were declared lawful for certain classes of service, neither carrier nor shipper
could thereafter draw into question in the courts the conduct of the other if it conformed to the legislative mandate;
save by an attack on the constitutionality of the statute:
By the amendat6ry legislation Congress has delegated 'to
the Commission as its administrative arm its undoubted
power to' declare; within constitutional limits, what are
lawful rates for the service to be performed by the carriers.
The action-of the Commission in fixing such rates for the
future is subject to the same tests as to its validity as
would be an act of Congress intended to accomplish the
same purpose..
As has been pointed out, the system now administered
by the Commission is dual in nature. Ai respects a rate
made by the carrier, its adjudication finds the facts and
may involve "a liability to pay reparation. The C6nmission may,. and often does, in the same proceeding, and
in a single report and order, exercise its additional authority by fixing rates or rate limits for the future. But
the fact -that this function is combined with that of passing upon the -rates theretofore and then in effect does"
not alter the character of the action. 8

Qpinion of the Court.

As respects its future conduct- the carrier is entitled
to rely upon the declaration as to what will be a lawful,
that is, a reasonable, rate; and if the order merely sets
limiks it is entitled to protection if itfixes a rate which
falls within them. Where, as in this ease, the Commission has made an order having a dual aspect, it may not
in a subsequent proceeding, acting in its quasi-judicial
capacity, ignore its own pronouncement promulgated in
its quasi-legislative capacity and retroactively repeal its
own enactment as to the reasonableness of the rate it has
prescribed.
The Commission in its report confuses legal concepts
in stating that the doctrine of res judicata does not affect
its action in a case like this one. It is unnecessary to
determine whether an adjudication with respect to reasoniableness of rates, theretofore, charged is binding, in
another proceeding,, for that question is not here presented. The rule of estoppel by judgment obviously applies only to bodies exercising judicial functions; it is
manifestly inapplicable to legislative action. The Commission's error arose from a failure to recognize that when
it prescribed a maximum reasonable rate for the future,
it was performing a legislative function, and that when
it was sitting to award reparation, it was .sitting for a
purpbse judicial in its nature. In the second capacity,
while not bound by the rule of res judicata, it was bound
to recognize the validity of the rule of conduct prescribed
by it and not to repeal its own enactment with retro-'.
active effect. It could repeal the order as it affected
future action, and substitute a new rule of conduct as
-often as occasion might require, but this was obviously
the limit of its power. as of that of the legislature itself.
The argument is pressed that this conclusion will work
serious inconvenience in the administration, of the Act;
will require the Commission constantly to rexamine the
fairness of rates prescribed, and will put an unbearable
