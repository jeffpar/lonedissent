numerous suits between the same parties, involving the
same issues of law or fact. It does not extend to cases
where there are numerous parties plaintiff or defendant,
and the issues between them and the adverse party are
not uecessarily identical. St. Louis, Iron Mountain &

While the present, bill sets up that the single issue of
constitutionality of the taxing statute is involved, the
alleged unconstitutionality depends upon the application
of the statute to each of the appellees, and its effect upon
his business, which is alleged to be interstate commerce.
The bill thus tenders separate issues of law and fact as to
each appellee, the nature of his business and the manner
and extent to which the tax imposes a burden on interstate commerce. The determination of these issues as to
any one taxpayer would not determine them as to any
other. There was thus 'a failure of such identity of parties
and issues as would support the jurisdiction in equity.

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 178.

Argued December 2, 3, 1931. Reargued. January 11,
1932.-Decided February 15, 1932.

1. A suit will not lie in a federal court to enjoin a state officer from
,collecting a tax that violates the Federal Constitution, where the
state law affords a legal remedy through payment of the tax under
protest and suit to recover it from the collecting officer,, and no
special circumstances are alleged in the bill which Would render the

legal remedy inadequate. Cf. Matthews v. Rodgers, ante, p. 521.
Pp. 532-534.
2. Such a legal remedy is afforded by the law of Illinois where the tax
pgyment is under duress, as where made to avoid forfeiture of a
corporate franchise. P. 532.
3. A state law providing a new equitable remedy cannot increase or
diminish the equity jurisdiction of federal courts. P. 533.
4. In determining what is a legal remedy and its adequacy to defeat
their equity jurisdiction, the federal courts are guided by the historic distinction between law and equity in those courts, not by the
name given to remedies or to distinctions made between them by

state practice. P. 534.
5. A remedy by action to recover a tax whicl has been paid is essentially a legal remedy, and not the less so because the state practice
has annexed to it a remedy by injunction for staying payment

over of the tax money, so that it may be available to satisfy judgment against the collector. Id.

from a decree of the District Court of three

judges, enjoining assessment and collection of a corpora-

tion franchise tax.
Mr. Bayard Lacey Catron, Assistant Attorney General
of Illinois, with whom Mr. Oscar E. Carlstrom,Attorney
General, was on the brief, for appellant.
Mr. Josiah Whitnel, with whom Mr. J. R. Turney was
on the brief, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case is here on appeal, Jud. Code §§ 238, 266, from
a final decree of a District Court of three judges for the
Southern District of Illinois, enjoining the assessment and
collection from appellee of the minimum annual corporation franchise tax of $1,000, under §§ 105, 107, 112, 114,
of the Illinois Corporation Act, as an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, and as violating the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After
argument here on the merits, th cause was again argued

by direction of, the Court, argument being limited to the
question of the jurisdiction of the district court, both with
respect to the amount involved in the suit and its iurisdiction as a; Court of equity.
The bill sets up as ground for equitable relief the threat
of revocation of appellee's certificate of. authority to do
business within the state for failure to pay the tax, pursuant to §§ 92 and 94 of the Act, and the consequent
irreparable injury .to its business. The equity jurisdiction
of the district court was challenged by appellant's motion
below to dismiss the bill of complaint, and by the assignments of error here, and the question presented, like that
in Matthews v. Rodgers, ante, p. 521, is whether, under
state laws, the appellee is'afforded such an adequate remedy, by payment of the tax and the maintenance of a suit
at law to recover it, as to preclude resort to the preventive
jurisdiction of equity.
By the laws of Illinois, as appellant argues, a tax paid
under duress and protest that it is illegally exacted, may
be recovered at law in an action of assumpsit, brought
either against the taxing body, the state excepted, see
Harvey & Boyd v. Olney, 42 Ill. 336; or against the collecting officer, see Yates v. Royal Ins. Co., 200 Ill. 202;
65 N. E. 726; School of Domestic Afts and Sciences v.
Harding,331 Ill. 330; 163 N. E. 15; See also German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Van Cleave, 191 Ill. 410, 413-414; 61
N. E.'94, and Hawkins v. Lake County, 303 Ill. 624, 629;
136 N. E. 487, in each of which the court entertained
bills by numerous taxpayers to enjoin the collection of
taxes or to compel their refund, on the express ground
that to do so would avoid a multiplicity of suits at law.
Recovery of the tax may not -be had, even though illegally. exacted, .unless its,,payment is procured by duress.
See Richardson Lubricating-Co. v. Kinney, 337 Ill. 122;

franchise tax like the present, made, to avoid forfeiture

of the franchise, which would result from nonpayment,
there is such duress as entitles the taxpayer to recover.

166 N. E. 501; see Chicago & Eastern,Illinois Ry. Co. v.
Miller, 309 Ill. 257; 140 N. E. 823.
By the Illinois statute, applicible to the present tax,Smith-Hurd's 1931 Revised Illinois Stathtes, c. 127, par.
172, §-2 (a), it is provided that:
"It shall be the duty of every officer, board, commission, commissioner, department,.institute, arm or agency
brought within the provisions of this Act by Section 1
hereof to hold for thirty days all moneys received for or
on behalf of the State under protest and on the expiration
of such period to deposit the same with the State Treasurer unless the party making such payment shall within
such period file a bill in chancery and secure a temporary
injunction restraining the making of such deposit, in
which case such payment shall be held until the final
order or decree of the court."
This statute, for reasons stated at length in Matthews
v. Rodgers, supra, can neither enlarg nor diminish the
equity jurisdiction of the federal courts. It does not purport to confer any new remedy for the recovery of the
tax. Nor does it impair the existing legal remedy, but
supplements it by providing a method under the local procedure for staying payment over of-the tax money, so that
it may be available for the satisfaction of any judgment
obtained against the collector. See. Interstate Iron" &
Steel Co. v. Stratton,340 Ill. 422"; 172 N. E. 705; O'Gara
Coal Co. v. Emmerson, supra; Hump HairpinMfg. Co. v.
Emmerson, 293 Ill. 387; 127 N.E. 746; 258 U. S. 290.
These cases recognize the continued existence in Illinois of the right to recover the tax. The fact that in
them the suits brought were denominated-" equitablei"

although the only relief of an equitable hature, sought or
allowed, was the injunction against payment over of the
tax, which was but incidental to the recovery of the money,
cannot alter the character of the right as one enforcible
at law. In determining what is a legal remedy and its
adequacy to defeat their equity jurisdiction, the federal
courts are guided by the historic distinction between law
and equity in those courts, not by the name given t6 remedies or to distinctions made between them by the state
practice. Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106, 110-111;, Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., 150 U. S.371, 379. By
this test the remedy by suit to recover a tax which has
been paid is essentially a.legal remedy, and it is not any
the less so nor any. the less adequate because the state
practice has annexed to it an equitable remedy.
There being a legal remedy for the recovery of the tax,
no case is made for invoking the jurisdiction of equity to
enjoin collection of it in the absence of allegations setting
up special circumstances which would render the legal
remedy inadequate. See Matthews'v. Rodgers, supra;
Arkansas Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Madde, 175 U. S. 269;
