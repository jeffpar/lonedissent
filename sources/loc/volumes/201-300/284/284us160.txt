At the time of the creation of these estates there was
no law taxing an estate by the entirety upon the death
of one of'the spouses. The Tyler case is the first decision
of this Court holding that an estate of that kind can be
taxed under any Act of Congress.
The decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals and of the
courts before which the question arose prior to that decision all held that an estate by entirety could not be taxed
under any of the Acts of Congress. Blount v. United

Opinion'of the Court.

284 U.S.

MR. Jusmcrc STo E d.elivered the opinion of the Court.
This 'suit was brought in the District Court, for the
Middle District of Pennsylvania, by the executor, to recover federal estate taxes alleged to have been illegally
exacted. A jury having been waived, the court found the
.facts as stipulated and gave judgment against the 'collector. 30 F. (2d) 395. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit, without deciding the case,- certified
here the questions involved, and, on joint motion of the
parties, .this Court ordered up the entire record. Jud.
Code 239.
The only controversy presented relates to taxes levied
and collected with respect to thirteen items of property,
real .and.personal, concededly held by decedent and his
wife as tenants by the entirety at his death in 1925. The
•appli able taxing statute is § 302 of the Revenue Act of
1924, 43 Stat. 253, 304, which provides that the gross
value of the decedentfs estate subject -to tax shall include
all property:."(e) ;To.the extent of the interest therein held as joint

tenants by the decedent and any other person, or as
tenants by the entirety by the decedent and spouse, or
deposited, with any-person carryifig on the banking business; in their joint names and payable to. either or the
survivor except, such part thereof as may be showih to have
originally beloiged to such other person and never to have
been received or acqtired by th6 latter from the decedent
for less than a fair consideration in money or money's.

Opinion of the Court.

The thirteen items of property with respect to which
the tax was imposed may be classified in three groups,
(1) property held upon tenancies by the entirety created
after the effective date of the. Revenue Act of 1924, (2)
property held.upon tenancies by the entirety created after
.the Revenue Act of 1916 and before the effective date of
the Revenue Act of 1924, and (3) bank accounts opened
in i910 in the joint names of decedent and his wife, in
which there were deposit balances at the date of his
death.
The district court accepted the contention. of the taxpayer that the nature of the estate by the entirety, and
,particularly the interest. in it of a surviving tenant, are
such as to preclude the imposition of death or transfer
taxes measured by the value of the interest which ceases
at the death of either tenant; and that the tax, if deemed
to be upon property, is a direct tax not apportioned, forbidden by Art. I, § 2, Clause 3, and § 9, Clause 4, of the
Constitution. After the decision of the district court, this
contention was considered and rejected by this Court in
Tyler v. United States, 281 U. S. 497, holding that a like
tax imposed under § 202 (c), Rev. Act of 1916, was a valid
indirect tax, measured by the value of the property, rights
in which devolved upon the surviving tendift upon the
happening of an event, the death of the other tenant by
the entirety.
The controlling force .of that decision is acknowledged
as to the items of property in Group (1), acquired after
the passage of the taxing act, and as to them it is conceded that the tax was rightly levied.
But it is urged that the tax imposed with respect to
Groups (2) and (3) is invalid. As the creation of the
tenancies by the entirety antedated the taxing act, and
the earlier corresponding sections had been-repealed, it is
insisted that the statute is given a retroactive operation,
such as that condemned by this Court in Nichols v. Cool-

idge,. 274.U. S. 531; Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S.
440; Coolidge v. Long, 282 U. S. 582. As §.302 (h) of the
Act of 1924 specifically makes the ,quoted provision of
subdivision (e) applicable to estates created or existing
before the passage of the 9tatute, the question presented
is not one of its construction or applicability; but of the
power of Congress to impose the tax. The Government
argues that the tax was laid on the devolution of rights
upon the wife at the death of her husband after the passage of the Act, and that therefore the statute was not
applied retroactively, even though the estate was created
before its enactment. Without foreclosing consideration
of this contention at another time, we find it unnecessary
now, in view of the facts of the present case, to pass
upon it.
Group 2. The tenancies in all of the items of the second
group were created after the passage of the 1916 Revenue
Act. Congress had by that act adopted a system of death
taxes, embracing, as it lawfully might, estates by the
entirety. As was pointed out in Tyler v. United States,
supra, pp. 503, 505, such estates are appropriate subjects
of death taxes and the taxation of then is a suitable
measure to prevent evasion of a system of taxation levied
on estates passing at death by will or inheritance. In
both respects they resemble gifts made in contemplation
of death, likewise taxed by the estate tax provisions of
the 1916 and later revenue acts. The considerations
which led us, in Milliken v. United States, 283 U. S. 15,
to uphold taxation of gifts in contemplation of death,
made after the 1916 Act and before that of 1918, at the
higher rate of the latter act, are equally applicable here.
The knowledge available before the creation of the estate
that it was embraced within an established taxing system
and that its taxation, on the same basis and in the same
manner as decedents' estates, was an essential part of the

UNITED STATES v. RYAN.

-

system to prevent evasions, relieves the present tax of the
objection that it is arbitXrarily retroactive.
Group S. Although the bank accounts were opened before the passage of the.Revenue Act of 1916, the-record
does not disclose whether the deposits, which.were the
sources of the credit balances at the time of the decedent's
death, were made before or after 1916. If after, the tax
was rightly laid, for reasons already stated, which support the tax with respect to the items in Group 2. As
the suit is brought to recover taxes already -paid, the presumption is that they were lawfully assessed and the
burden rests on the taxpayer to prove the fTcts which establish their illegality. Niles Bement Pond Co. v. United
States, 281 U. S. 357, 361; Reinecke v. Spalding, 280 U. S.
227, 232. As the taxpayer has failed to sustain the burden in this respect or to show that the wife had originally
owned or paid for any of the items or to present any
facts to support a recovery other than those stated, the
judgment is
Reversed.
