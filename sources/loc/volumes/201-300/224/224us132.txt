WOOD v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 71.

Argued November 16, 17, 1911.-Decided April 1, 1912.

An officer of the Navy serving as aid to the Admiral under the provisions of the acts of March 2 and 3, 1899, cc. 378 and 421, 30 Stat.
995, 1024, 1045, is not entitled under the assimilating provisions of
§ 13 of the Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, c. 413, 30 Stat.
1007, to the higher rank and pay provided under § 1019, Rev. Stat.,
for aids to the General of the Army, irrespective of the actual rank
held by such naval officer during his period of service as such aid.
By the proviso to § 1094, Rev. Stat., which became effective prior to
1888, the office of General of the Army created by § 1096, and the
rank and incidents thereto ceased, and were revived by the act of
June 1, 1888, 25 Stat. 165, c. 338, only for the period of the life of
General Sheridan, and again ceased on his death, since which time
there is no officer of the Army to which pay of aids to the Admiral
of the Navy can be assimilated under § 13 of the Navy Personnel
Act of 1899.
An incongruity resulting from an omission in an act of Congress does
not justify the courts exercising legislative power to create an office
or pay therefor, and so held that the fact that the pay of all other
naval officers, including aids to Rear Admirals, is assimilated to'that
of corresponding officers of the Army except aids to the Admiral is
a matter that must be corrected, if it is to be corrected, by Congress
and not by the courts.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of

the court.
The office of Admiral of the Navy was reestablished
by the act of March 2, 1899, 30 Stat. 995, reenacted in
identical terms by a portion of the Naval Appropriation
Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1045, c. 421. By another
provision of the same act, 30 Stat. 1024, 1025, the Admiral was given the same pay and allowances "as had
been received by the last General of the United States
Army.
"From October'17, 1904, until February 29, 1908, the
claimant performed the duties prescribed by an order
of the Secretary of the Navy, dated October 1, 1904,
which directed him to report to the Admiral of the
Navy,

for duty as aid to the Admiral of the Navy, and for duty

within which these services were performed the claimant

for the earlier portion of the time, was that of Lieutenant
Commander and during the remainder of the time that
of Commander. He demanded the pay and allowances
1 On January 31, 1912, the court directed additional briefs to be
filed upon the following questions:
Did § 1096 of the Revised Statutes cease to be operative when the
office of General of the Army became extinct? In other words, were
not the provisions of that section repealed by force of the proviso of
§ 1094, Revised Statutes?
If repealed, what provision, if any, is relied upon as the basis for
applying the terms of § 1096 to the claim made in this action? In compliance with this order an additional brief was filed on beiialf
of the appellant on February 15,1912, and on behalf of the United States
on February 13, 1912.

of a Captain of the Navy, upon the theory that the
Admiral of the Navy corresponded in rank with the General of the Army, that by Rev. Stat., § 1096, the General
of the Army was entitled to aids, who received increased
compensation as such aids by reason of the pay attached
to the higher rank conferred upon them while serving as
aids to the General, which higher pay the aid to the Admiral became entitled to receive by virtue of the clause
of § 13 of the Naval Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, 30
Stat. 1004, 1007, c. 413, assimilating the pay of officers
of the Navy to that of officers of the Army.
Section 1096, Rev. Stat., relied upon in connection
with the assimilating provision just referred to is as follows:
"SEC. 1096. The General may select from the Army
such number of aids, not exceeding six, as he may deem
necessary, who shall have, while serving on his staff,
the rank of colonel of cavalry."
This appeal was taken from a judgment of the Court
of Claims dismissing the claim.
Putting aside immaterial considerations, the question upon which the controversy turns is this: In March,
1899, when the office of Admiral was re-created, were
the provisions of § 1096, Rev. Stat., existing or had they
been repealed, thereby causing it to come to pass that
there was no law concerning aids to the General .of the
Army upon which the assimilating provisions of the act
of 1899 could operate? We say this is the fundamental
question, because it is patent that the act of 1899 which
re-created the office of Admiral did not in and of itself
provide for aids to that officer or fix extra compensation
for such services, and therefore the right here asserted
must depend exclusively upon the existence of some law
providing for aids to the General of the Army and their
pay, which in virtue of the application of the assimilating statute became operative as to aids to the Admiral.

WOOD v. UNITED STATES.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

While by § 1094, Rev. Stat., it was provided that the
Army of the United States should consist, among other
officers, of "one General," the section concluded with
the following:
"Provided, That when a vacancy occurs in the office
of General or Lieutenant-General such office shall cease,
and all enactments creating or regulating such offices
shall, respectively, be held to be repealed."
It is not questioned that § 1096, Rev. Stat., was a
regulation concerning the office of General of the Army,
and it is not disputed that that section was repealed
prospectively by the proviso to § 1094 above quoted, a
repeal which became operative when the event 'provided
for the cessation of the office of General occurred. It is,
further, not disputed that years before the re-creation
of the office of Admiral in 1899 the result provided for
in the proviso to § 1094 had taken place, and hence that
§ 1096,. concerning aids to the General of the Army, had
ceased to exist as the result of the non-existence of the
grade of General of the Army to which the provisions of
that section applied.
The primary contention is that § 1096 was revived as
the result of the act of June 1, 1888, 25 Stat. 165, c. 338,
by virtue of which Lieutenant General Sheridan was made
for life the General of the Army. The secondary proposition is that the provisions of the section which it is
contended were thus revived remained in force (although
in abeyance) after the death of General Sheridan and
despite the fact that the act of 1888, which provided
for his appointment as General declared that the grade
should cease on his death. The contention, however,
in reason rests upon a plain misconception of the act of
1888, since it but insists that while the provisions of that
act only revived the grade of General for a limited and
specified purpose, nevertheless the effect of the act was
to revive incidental, provisions of law concerning that

office so as to cause them to continue to exist after the
period during which alone the statute contemplated
they should be in existence. But so to construe the
statute would divide it against itself, would presuppose
that it contemplated that an effect should arise from its
enactment plainly at war with the purpose which its text
manifests Congress intended to accomplish by its adoption. When it is considered that the grade of General
of the Army had ceased to exist long prior to the act of
1888 and that the statutory incidents regulating that
office, including § 1096, Rev. Stat., had also passed out of
existence, we think it results that the provisions of the
act of 1888 reviving the office of General and the incidents
relating to that office were all controlled by the limitation of time which that act imposed. In other words,
we think that the office and its incidents were but revived for the sole purposes and for the limited period
specified, and none other, and therefore no subject to
which that act related can be said to have been generally
rednacted so as to survive the limitations which the act
itself expressly contemplated.
. The failure by Congress during the many years which
have elapsed since the re-creation of the office of Admiral to make any provision concerning the pay of aids
to that officer gives rise to the assumption of a legislative
construction in accord with the view which we have expressed. The matter is not however left to mere inference
resulting from silence, since although Congress in what
is known as the New Navy Pay. Act of May 13, 1908,
35 Stat. 127, c. 166, in terms specifically provided for
the pay of every officer in the Navy, including the Admiral and embracing extra compensation to aids to Rear
Admirals, made no provision whatever for compensation
for services which might be rendered by an officer acting as aid to the Admiral. The incongruity, if any, which
it is suggested must result from providing for extra com-

pensation for an gid to a Rear Admiral and none for
aids to the higher officer, the Admiral, if admitted, would
be but the consequence of legislative omission, and would
not justify the exertion of judicial power for the purpose
of re-creating a provision of law, concerning aids to the
General of the Army, which has long since ceased to exist,
in order to afford a subject upon which the assimilating
provision 'of the Naval Personnel. Act of 1899 might
operate.

PLUMMER v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 177.

Argued February 29, March 1, 1912.-Decided April 1, 1912.

Under § 13 of the Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, 30 Stat. 1007,
c. 413, and the acts of June 7, 1900, 31 Stat. 697, e. 859, March 2,
1907, 34 Stat. 1167, c. 2511, and May 13, 1908, 35 Stat. 127, c. 166,
the pay of acting assistant surgeons was enhanced and assimilated
to that of assistant surgeons in the Army, and did not remain fixed
as regulated by § 1556, Rev. Stat.
Where an act of Congress, such as the Navy Personnel Act of 1899,
provides for a standard by which to determine rank and pay of officers, it will not be presumed that Congress intended to create an inequality of compensation while leaving unmodified equality of rank
and duty, and so held as to the provisions for pay of assistant surgeons and acting assistant surgeons in the Navy.
The construction of the statutes involved in this case is the contemporaneous construction given thereto by the Executive Department
charged with execution of the provisions thereof.
Longevity pay of officers of the Army and Navy under the act of
: May 13, 1908, 35 Stat. 127, c. 166, is computed on the sum of the
base pay and not the base pay and previous increases thereof.
Where Congress, after a decision of this court construing a certain
,expression used in a statute, passes a statute declaring that those
