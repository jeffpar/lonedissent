that money unless the contract was to be carried through,
that he might have declined to go further and have sued
the company for the breach, Anvil Mining Co. v. Humble,
153 U. S. 540, 552, but that he could not claim part of the
purchase-price, as such, unless he was content to go on,
and thus that Powers had elected against the termination
of the contract before he attempted it. But no such
election is pleaded, and not enough appears to show that
if it had been, it could have been proved. The precise
nature of the former suit does not appear, nor whether it
had been proceeded with far enough to conclude Powers's
right of choice. Moreover if Powers terminated the contract, he would not affirm it by suing for proceeds of ore
belonging to him in that event. No error appears in the
judgment below, and it is affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

SWANSON v. SEARS.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAHO.
No. 217.

Argued March 15, 1912.-Decided April 1, 1912.

A location and discovery on land withdrawn quoad hoc from the public
domain by a valid and subsisting mining claim is absolutely void for
the purpose of founding a contradictory right; nor does it become
valid by reason of the subsequent failure of the right existing when
it was filed.
17 Idaho, 321, affirmed.

SWANSON v. SEARS.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JusTICE HOLMES

delivered the opinion'of the court.

The defendant in error Kettler applied for a patent for
a mining claim. The plaintiff in error filed an adverse
claim under Rev. Stat., ยง 2326, and then brought this
complaint to establish his right of possession to the area
in dispute. The facts are these: In 1881 the defendant's
claim, then called Emma No. 2, was located, running
north and south. In 1889 the plaintiff's claim, Independence No. 2, was located, running east and west, its westerly end overlapping the southerly end of Emma No. 2,
and the discovery being within the overlapping part.
Kettler, who then had Emma No. 2, failed, because of
the illness of her daughter, to do the assessment work
upon it for 1903, and, supposing that to be the only way
to hold the ground, relocated it on January 1, 1904, as
Malta No. 1, since which time she has done the required
annual work. The only question is whether, on the failure
of the defendant, as stated, for 1903, the plaintiff's location attached, or whether it was wholly void. The state
courts gave judgment for the defendant, 17 Idaho, 321,
and the plaintiff brought the case to this court.
The argument for the plaintiff is a vain attempt to reopen what has been established by the decisions. A location and discovery on land withdrawn quoad hoc from the
public domain by a valid and subsisting mining claim is
absolutely void for the purpose of founding a contradictory
right. Belk v. Meagher, 104 U. S. 279. Gwillim v. Donnellan, 115 U. S. 45. This doctrine was not qualified in its
proper meaning by Del Monte Mining & Milling Co. v.
Last Chance Mining & Milling Co., 171 U. S. 55, for that
case attributed effect to the overlapping location only for
the purpose of securing extralateral rights on the dip of a
vein the apex of which was within the second and outside.
of the first; rights consistent with all those acquired by
the first location. See Creede & Cripple Creek Mining &

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

Milling Co. v. Uinta Tunnel Mining & TransportationCo.,
196 U. S. 337, 342. The principle of Belk v. Meagher was
reaffirmed, 171 U. S. 78, 79, as it was again in Clipper
Mining Co. v. Eli Mining and Land Co., 194 U. S. 220,
226, 227, and in Brown v. Gurney, 201 U. S. 184, 193. It
is true that there is reasoning to the contrary in Lavagnino
v. Uhlig, 198 U. S. 443, but in Farrell v. Lockhart, 210
U. S. 142, 146, 147, that language was qualified and the
older precedents recognized as in full force. We deem
it unnecessary to consider the distinctions attempted by
the plaintiff between location and relocation, voidable
and void claims, etc., as the very foundation of his right,
the offer and permission of the United States under Rev.
Stat., ยง 2322, was wanting when he did the acts intended
to erect it. His entry was a trespass, his claim was void,
and the defendant's forfeiture did him no good.
There was some attempt before us to recede from the
concession made below that the defendant had a right to
relocate under Rev. Stat., ยง 2324. We do not see how it
could help the plaintiff if the proposition were incorrect,
or any sufficient reason for listening to the argument in
this case.
Judgment affirmed.
