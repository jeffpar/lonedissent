TEXAS & PACIFIC RY. v. HOWELL.
224 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY
v. HOWELL.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.
No. 947.

Submitted April 22, 1912.-Decided May 13, 1912.

Where the basis for review by this court has no bearing on the questions raised, but is simply plaintiff in error's charter from the United
States, this court goes no further than to inquire whether plain error

is made out.
In this case held, that there was no assumption of risk on the part of
an employ6 working under a coal chute who was struck by a piece
of timber falling from above him where other men had been put to
work; even if the employs had knowledge of such overhead work,
the duty of the employer to provide a reasonably safe place to work

remained.
Where the injury actually caused the disease, the injured party may
recover even if the disease does not immediately develop; and in
this case held, that the jury were warranted in finding that Potts

disease with which defendant in error was afflicted was the direct
cause of the injury, although it did not develop for over a year.

THE facts, which involve the liability of an employer
for injury to an employ6, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. William L. Hall for plaintiff in error:
The plaintiff below, failed to make out a case of negligence on the part of the railroad company, and the jury
should have been so instructed.
That portion of the evidence raising a question as to
whether the defendant was -entitled to peremptory instruction is practically without contradiction.
Temporary imperfections incident to a repair are not
within the general rule. Bishop's Non-contract Law,
§ 649; Koatz v. Chicago R. R., 65 Iowa, 224.

The mere happening of the accident did not raise a
presumption of negligence. There is no liability in the
case unless the railway company was negligent, and the
burden was on plaintiff to show negligence. The facts
are undisputed that while Howell was doing the work
below and his fellow servants were doing the work above,
a piece of plank slivered off and fell and struck Howell.
The mere happening of this unexpected result cannot be
said to condemn the method or plan of the work, without
further evidence. If there was no negligence shown oh the
part of the defendant, the plaintiff assumed the risk and
the consequences. Patton v. T. & P. Ry., 179 U. S. 658;
H. & T. C. Ry. v. Alexander, 132 S. W. Rep. 119.
The rule requiring a railroad company to furnish a
safe place for its employ6s to work has no application
to a case where laborers are sent to repair a defective
structure such as a coal chute.
The rule is not applicable to cases in which the very
work which the servants are employed to do is of such
a nature that its progress is constantly changing the conditions as regards an increase or diminution of safety.

place" rule see Schneider v. Quartz Co., 220 Pa. St. 548, 69

The employ6 engaged in making the necessary repairs,

the same may be repaired, assumes the ordinary risk of
danger incident thereto. Southern Ry. Co. v. Lyons, 169

The plaintiff assumed the risk of planks falling from
the floor above on to him if he knew the other servants
were at work tearing up the floor over him.
It was not negligent for the employer to send men up
on to the staging of the coal chute if it be true that no
harm would result if the men above carefully performed
their work.
The Potts disease of the spine with which the plaintiff
is now suffering is too remote a consequence to be chargeable against the defendant as the result of the injury he
received. Crane Elevator Co. v. Lippert, 63 Fed. Rep.
942, can be distinguished.
While Potts disease may not in some cases be such a

direct result of an injury as to be the basis of a recovery,
in this case the result is too remote from the injury and too
many circumstances have intervened to allow us to look
to his present condition.
At common law death must ensue within one year from
the injury to make the injury the legal cause of the
death.
Mr. S. P. Jones for defendant in error:
The trial court did not err in refusing to direct a verdict in favor of the railway company, in that the evidence
was sufficient to justify the jury in finding that the railway
company was guilty of negligence which was the proximate and direct cause of the injury to plaintiff below.

The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that
plaintiff below, in accepting employment, assumed the
risks which were ordinarily incident to that employment,
but did not assume risks that were the result of the negligence of the railway company; and that if he was injured
by reason of one of the risks ordinarily incident to the
employment, that he could not recover. Northwestern Fuel

MR.

JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is an action for personal injuries done to the plaintiff, the defendant in error, Howell, while in the employ
of the Railway Company. The plaintiff had a verdict
and judgment, subject to" exceptions, and the judgment,
was affirmed without discussion by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. The material facts can be stated in a few
words. The plaintiff was set to digging- a hole for a
post under a coal chute. While he was at work the
defendant put other men to removing certain timfers
and planks from the floor twelve feet or so above him,
without his knowledge, as he contends, and a piece of
timber fell and struck the plaintiff on the head. The
plaintiff now is suffering from tuberculosis of the spine,
in consequence, as he says, of the blow. The defendant
asked the court to direct a verdict, and also to instruct
the jury that if the plaintiff knew that other servants
were tearing up the floor above him he took the risk, that
if no harm would have resulted but for the negligence
of those other servants the defendant was not liable, and
that the plaintiff's present disease of the spine was too
remote from the blow to be attributed to it as a result.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

The case was left to the jury with instructions that if
the injury was due to negligence of the defendant in sending men to work above the plaintiff, as a contributing
cause, the defendant was liable, but not if it was due
only to the negligence of fellow-servants in their way of
performing their work. The question also was left to
the jury whether the disease was the direct consequence
of the blow.
The case was begun in the state court and was removed
to the Circuit Court, and is brought here, solely on the
ground that the plaintiff in error has a charter from the
United States. But for that accident, which has no bearing upon the questions raised, the case would stop with
the Circuit Court of Appeals. Under such circumstances
we go no further than to inquire whether plain error is
made out. Chicago Junction Railway Co. v. King; 222
U. S. 222. We find nothing that requires us to reverse
the judgment. It was open to the jury to find that the
usual duty to take reasonable care to furnish a safe place
to the plaintiff in his work remained. They well might
be of opinion that the general nature of the things to be
done gave no notice to the plaintiff that he was asked
to take a necessary risk. At the same time they were
warranted in saying that if the defendant saw fit to do
the work above and below at the same time it did so with
notice of the danger to those underneath and took chances
that could not be attributed wholly to the hand through
which the harm happened. Even if Howell knew that
repairs were going on overhead that did not necessarily
put him on an equality with his employer, and require
a ruling that he took the risk. Kreigh v. Westinghouse,
Ch?4rch, Kerr & Co., 214 U. S. 249.
The plaintiff was injured on March 3, 1908. There
was ample evidence that the blow occasioned the development of his disease, although it was not discovered
to be the Potts disease, as it is called, for over a year.

Syllabus.

But it is argued that if such a disease is due to the presence
of tubercular germs in a man's system before the accident
the defendant ought not to be required to pay more than
it would to a normal man. On this point also we are. of

opinion that the jury were warranted in finding.that the
disease was the direct result of the injury, as they were
required to, by the very conservative instructions to them,
before holding the defendant to answer for it. Crane
Elevator Co. v. Lippert, 63. Fed. Rep. 942. 11 C., C. A.

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

Argued April 25,-26, 1912.-Decided May 13, 1912.

This court will entertain a direct review of -thejudgment of the Circuit
Court under § 5 of the Circuit Court of Appeals Act of 1891, in a.
revenue case which inivolves not only questions of classification'and
amount of dut' thereunder, but also questions as to the constitutionality of a law of the.United States or the validity or construc•tion of a treaty under its authority.
Where the importer throughout has insisted that the merchandise is
dutiable at the rate fixed by a reciprocal agreement entered into
by the United States under § 3 of'the Tariff Act of 1897., there is a
direct appeal to this court under § 5 of the Circuit Court of Appeals
Act of 1891, provided such agreement is a treaty.'
Generally a treaty is a compact between two or more independent
nations with a view to the public welfare, but quwre,whether under
the provisions of the Constitution of the United States an agreement
is a treaty unless made by the President and ratified by two-thirds
of the Senate.
