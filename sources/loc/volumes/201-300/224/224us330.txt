record, and that shows a finding of the court upon the
question of compensation, to which finding there was no
objection taken nor exception reserved. The finding
determines the matter, being in the nature of a special
verdict of a jury. United States v. New York Indians, 173
U. S. 464.
Ceballos & Co. v. United States, 214 U. S. 47, is not applicable. There was a contract of which there could be
no dispute, and therefore a motion to embrace it in the
record from the Court of Claims was granted and the case
reviewed in the light thereof.
The motion to remand the case is therefore denied.
Judgment affirmed.

CITY OF POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE AND
TELEGRAPH COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE ,CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 215.

Argued March 14, 15, 1912.-Decided April 8, 1912.

A provision in a state constitution that municipal corporations may
establish and operate public utility plants, and that persons and
corporations may establish and operate works for supplying public
service upon such conditions and under such regulations as the
municipality may prescribe, is a step towards municipal control or
ownership, and is not a grant to others of a right to occupy streets
without the con*nt of the municipality; nor does it limit the municipality to regulations under its police power. The conditions are
of general import; and so held as to the provision in Article XI, § 19,
of the constitution of California as amended October 11, 1911.
There is no sufficient reason why this court should not follow the
highest court of California in construing "telegraph" corporations as
used in § 536 of the Civil Code of that State as not including " telephone" corporations.

POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE CO.
224 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

Where a statute is amended so as to bring a certain class thereunder,
the amendment to take effect at a subsequent date, before which
date another act is passed relating to the same subject with a general repealing act enumerating exceptions, the amended statute is
repealed, subject only to the exceptions before any rights acdrue
under the amendment.
In the absence of any apparent policy inducing it, it will be assumed
that an exception to the repealing clause of an act to regulate franchises of "lines doing an interstate business" was made unwillingly
and because the legislature- assumed it was bound to exempt such
lines from regulations.
In this case held that under the statutes of California a telephone corporation operating interstate and local lines in Pomona, a city of
the fifth class, obtained rights to maintain its main line in the
streets but not its local posts and wires except subject to regulations
of the city.
172 Fed. Rep. 829; 97 C. C. A. 251, reversed.'

TRE facts, which involve the validity and constitutionality of certain provisions of the constitution and
statutes of California in regard to the use of streets by telephone companies, are-stated in the opinion.
Mr. John W. Shenk and Mr. William J. Carr, with
whom Mr. C. W. Guerin, Mr. Robert G. Loucks, Mr. W. B.

Mathews, Mr. Leslie R. Hewitt, Mr. J. P. Wood and
Mr. J. W. Joos were on the brief, for appellants:
Poles and wires in the streets without permission given
by competent authority are nuisances and may be abated.
No user and no lapse of time can legalize the nuisance.
The company can justify its invasion of the streets only
by pointing to a particular statute or law authorizing it.
The burden is on it to justify its use of the streets.

No claim of right under the act of Congress of July 24,
1866 (Federal Telegraph Act) is here presented.
The interstate commerce clause of the Constitution
does not in itself, confer upon the company the right to
appropriate for the maintenance of its system portions
of the streets of the city of Pomona. Competent authority
from the State therefore is necessary. N. W. Telephone
Exch. Co. v. St. ChaRes, 154 Fed. Rep. 386.
The expenditure of money by the company and the
extension of its system, even though with the consent
or at the request of the city, furnishes no authority to
the company to maintain its lines. The mode whereby
the city may contract or grant a privilege being prescribed,
that mode constitutes the measure of the city's power in
such respect, and any right granted or claimed otherwise
is a mere nullity. Estoppel will ,not lie against the city
in such case to deny the existence of the contract or privilege. Dean v. Contra Costa County, 122 California, 421,

Section 536 of the Civil Code, prior to its repeal and reenactment in 1905, in terms applied only to telegraph
corporations and to lines of telegraph. It did not apply
to telephone corporations nor purport to confer any rights
in the highways as to telephone wires or lines. The company derived no rights thereunder to construct or maintain telephone poles, lines or wires in the streets of the
City of Pomona.
The lines and wires of the company in Pomona, which
were destroyed or threatened by the city, were not telegraph lines or wires, but were telephone lines and wires.

Un. Tel. Co., 107 Fed. Rep. 10; Cumberland Tel. Co. v.
Evansville, 127 Fed. Rep. 187.
No rights were acquired by the company under § 536
of the Civil I Code prior to its repeal and reenactment
in 1905. The word "telegraph" as therein used does not
include "telephone."
Davis v. Pacific'Tel. Co., 127 California, 312; Sunset Tel. Co. v. Pasadena,42 Cal. Dec. 593.
The construction placed upon the word "telegraph"
as contained in § 591 of the Penal Code in no wise controls
tle court in construing the same word as used in § 536
of the Civil Code. Because a word or expression as used
in one statute is given a certain meaning, it does not
follow that the same meaning must be given to it when
used in another statute. The same word or expression
may have different meaning_ even when used in the

Maryland, 646, 654; Wall v. Board of Directors, 145 California, 468, 473.
The rules of construction properly applicable to the
particular statute or expression controls the courts in
their interpretations thereof. A previous construction
of the same statute or the same expression, arrived at
under a different rule of construction, is not binding and
will be disregarded. Blythe v. Ayers, 96 California, 532,

St. Ry. Co., 108 California, 38, 44; Bartramv. Central Turnpike Co., 25 California, 284.
If a statute relating to the exercise of a franchise or a'
contract therefor is susceptible of two meanings, the one
restricting and the other extending the powers of the
grantee, that construction is to be adopted which works
the least harm to the State. Water Co. v. Knoxville, 200

Danville, 180 U. S. 619; Rogers Park Water Co. v. Fergus,

In the construction of statutes,, the intent of the legislature is to be given effect. This intent is to be found
in the statute itself. Words are to be interpreted according
to their meaning at the time of the passage of the statute.

Statutes purporting to grant rights in the public highways to telegraph companies had no application to
telephone companies. Richmond v. Bell Tel. Co., 174

101 S. W. Rep. 770. See also SuburbanLight Co. v. Boston,
153 Massachusetts, 200.
Section 536 of the Civil Code, as rcnacted in 1905,
was repealed, except as to "telegraph or telephone lines
doing an interstate business" by the Franchise Act of
1905, commonly known as the Broughton Act (Statutes
1905, page 777). The company cannot justify its use
of the streets under said section as re6nacted.
So far as the Broughton Act was repugnant to and in
conflict with the provisions of § 536 of the Civil Code,
as reenacted, it operated as repeal thereof. See Ex parte
Sohncke, 148 California, 262.
For the history of legislation in California purporting
to extend authority direct from the State to use the
public highways for the construction and maintenance
of telephone lines, see Ord. Mains. No. 30, Pomona; No. 75
of Pasadena; No. 1130 of Los Angeles; Sunset Tel. Co.

v. Morrill, 26 California, 336; Southern Bell Tel. Co. v.
D'Alemberte, 21 So. Rep. 571.
Although there may be a technical distinction between
a proviso and an exception, such distinction is generally
disregarded. United States v. Coke, 17 Wall. 168.
The burden was on the company to show that its lines
were doing an interstate business. Penn. Ry. Co. v.
Knight, 192 U. S. 21.
The exception of "telegraph or telephone lines doing
an interstate busihess" contained in the Broughton Act
is not in itself a grant of a franchise to construct and maintain such lines. It is not the function of an exception
or proviso to confer power or grant a privilege. Chicago
v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 126 Illinois, 276; Commonwealth v.
Hough, 22 Pa. Co. Ct. 440; Sunset Tel. Co. v. Pasadena,
supra.
Section 19, Art. XI, of the constitution, as amended
on October 10, 1911, is not to be construed as a blanket
grant of a franchise from the State to use the streets of
municipalities for the operation of telephone lines and the
works of the other utilities mentioned: ' On the contrary,
said section as amended repealed in toto § 536 of the Civil
Code, as reenacted in 1905.
This court may here properly consider § 19 of Art. XI.
A decree granting an injunction based upon a law repealed
after the entry of such decree, but prior to the determination of the appeal therefrom, will not be affirmed. Cooley's

224 U. S.

Argument for Appellee..

The repeal of § 536 of the, Civil Code as reenacted in
1905 by the amendment of § 19 of Art. XI of the constitution neither impairs the obligation of any contract of
the company arising under said § 536, nor assails any of
its vested rights.
Under § 327, Political Code, any statute may be repealed
at any time except when it is otherwise provided therein.
No vested contractual rights can arise in the face of
such provisions. Shields v. Ohio, 95 U.. S. 319; Gas Light
Co. y. Hamilton, 146 U. S. 258; San Antonio -TractionCo.
v. Altgelt, 200 U. S. 304; Bienville Water Supply Co. v.

Postal Tel. Co., 145 Fed. Rep. 602; Blair v. Chicago, 201
U. S. 200.
Again the lines destroyed or threatened by the City
of Pomona were constructed or maintained wrongfully
and without competent authority.- Even though § 536
as re6nacted in 1905 continued in full force until repealed
in October, 1911, the continued maintenance of these lines
wrongfully constructed or maintained in the first instance
would give rise to no contractual right authorizing their
maintenance for all time to come. The elements going
to make up a contract are entirely wanting.

Appellee has the right, under § 536 of the Civil Code
of California, as reenacted in 1905, to use the streets of
the City of Pomona for its telephone system without a
special franchise therefor from the city. Davis v. Pacific

embraced within its meaning the narrower word "telephone," but Sunset Telephone Co. v. Pasadena, 118 Pac.

Section 536 of the Civil Code is a grant of right by
the State to telephone and telegraph corporations to use

element in the business and social life of the day.

The conclusion of the Supreme Court, in the Pasadena

POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE CO.
224 U. S.

Argument for Appelee.

Case, that §.536 confers no rights upon telegraph or telephone companies, so far as the streets of Pasadena are
concerned, is inapplicable to Pomona, which is a city of
the fifth class. Municipal Corp. Act, Cal. Stats., 1883,
p. 93; Fragley v. Phelan, 126 California, 383, 387; Ex parte
Helm, 143 California, 553; Dawson v. Superior Court,

13 Cal. App. 582.
Section 536 was not repealed by the Franchise Act of
1905, Stats. Cal., 1905, p. 777.
The provisions of the Franchise Act of 1905 are not
inconsistent with those of § 536, as reeinacted in 1905,
because § 536 is a grant of franchise, and the Franchise
Act of 1905 only provides the method by which franchises
must-be granted; it contains no delegation of power to
grant franchises. Supervisors v. Lackawanna &c., 93
U. S. 619, 624.
The power to grant franchises, for the use of the highways in a city, inheres in the State. In re Johnston, 137
California, 115, 122; Thomason v. Ruggles, 69 California,
564; South Pasadena v. L. A. T. Ry. Co., 109 California,
315.
The delegation to a municipal corporation of the power
to grant franchises must clearly appear, before the right
to exercise the power may be asserted. Any reasonable
doubt, concerning the existence of the power, is to be
resolved against the municipal corporation. See Von
Schmidt v. Widber, 105 California, 151; Glass v. Ashbury,
49 California, 571; Wisconsin Tel. Co. v. Sheboygan, 86
N. W. Rep. 657, 661; Water Co. v. Los Angeles, 88 Fed.
Rep. 720.
The general rule that, where a later statute deals
with the same subject-matter as does an earlier one,
and in such way as to indicate that the lawmakers intended the later act to be a substitute for the earlier one,
the prior statute is held to have been repealed, does not apply to this case as the 1905 Franchise Act does not deal

with the same subject-matter as does §536. Hess v.
Reynolds, 113 U. S. 73, 79; Bank v. Cahn, 79 California,
463, 465; Pattersonv. Tatum, 18 Fed. Cas. 1331.
Any repeal of §536 of the Civil Code by the Franchise
Act of 1905 could have been only by implication. Such
repeals are not favored and are never allowed except in
cases of clear and irreconcilable conflict. Supervisors v.
Lackawanna R. R. Co., 93 U. S. 619, 624. See also
Wodd v. United States, 16 Pet. 341, 362; The Distilled

Hilton v. Curry, 124 California, 84; Rowe v. Hibernia
Say. & L. Soc., 134 California, 403, 406.
Section 536 of the Civil Code was reenacted at the same
session of the legislature and at about the same time that
the Franchise Act of 1905 was passed. This circumstance
is a strong argument against the repeal by implication of
the former by the latter. State v. Board of Commissioners,
85 N. E. Rep. 513, 522; State v. Duncan (Ala.), 50 So.
Rep. 265, 266; Stubblefield v. Menzies, 11 Fed. Rep. 268,
276.
The Circuit Court erred in concluding that § 536 of the
Civil Code was repealed by the Franchise Act of 1905.
Judge Gilbert, in his dissenting opinion in the Circuit
Court of Appeals, did not follow that conclusion. N. W.
Tel. Exch. Co. v. St. Charles, 154 Fed. Rep. 386, does not
support the conclusion for which it is cited.
Appellants concede that, under § 536 telephone lines
doing an interstate business are entitled to use the high-

POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE CO.

ways of the State, including the streets of Pomona. The
lines of the appellee in Pomona are part of a homogeneous
interstate telephone system operated by the appellee and
extending throughout the State of California and in the
States of Nevada, Washington and Oregon.
The system in Pomona is a part of the interstate
telephone system of the appellee extending throughout
the State of California and into many parts of the States
of Nevada, Oregon and Washington. United States v.
Southern Ry. Co., 164 Fed. Rep. 347, 349; United States

Without excluding interstate telephone lines from its
operation, the act of March 22, 1905, would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause. Interstate telephone communications are interstate commerce. Muskogee Telephone Co. v. Hall, 118 Fed. Rep. 382; West. Un.
Tel. Co. v. Pendleton, 122 U. S. 347; In re Penn. Telephone
Co., 20 Atl. Rep. 846. See also Pasadenav. L. A. T. Ry.

The appellee has the right under § 19 of Art. XL of
the constitution of the State of California, as amended
October 10, 1911, to use the streets of the City of Pomona
for its telephone system without a special franchise therefor from the city.
This section has been construed by the Supreme Court
of California to be a direct grant, from the State, to the
persons therein designated, and a city may not require
the persons, to whom the grant is made, to obtain a permit
from it, as a condition precedent to the exercise of the
right granted by the constitutional provision. See People

MR.JUSTICE

HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill broughtby the appellee, a California corporation, to restrain the City of Pomona from removing
the appellee's poles and wires from the streets of the city,
and from preventing the appellee's placing further poles
and wires in the streets. The Circuit Court dismissed
the bill, 164 Fed. Rep. 561, but the decree was reversed
and an injunction granted by the Circuit Court of Appeals.
172 Fed. Rep. 829. 97 C. C. A. 251. Two of the grounds
originally relied upon were that the appellee, being a
telegraph as well as a telephone company, had rights under
the act of Congress of July 24, 1866, c. 230, 14 Stat. 221
(Rev. Stat., §§ 5263 et seq.), that were infringed, and that
the conduct of the city had given rise to a contract. These
are no longer pressed, but they warranted taking the case
to the Circuit Court of Appeals. Spreckles Sugar Refining
Co. v. McClain, 192 U. S.397, 407. The remaining ground
is that the constitution of California as amended in 1911,
or the statutes of the State, contained a grant with which
the Constitution of the United States does not permit
the city to interfere. This is the only argument pressed
here. Unless the appellee got a grant from one of these
two sources it has no right to, occupy the streets.
The claim based upon the amendment to Article XI,
§ 19, of the constitution of the State, October 10, 1911,
does not impress us. Before that date the article provided that in cities having no public works for artificial light, etc., individuals or corporations of the State
duly authorized should have the privilege of using the
streets, etc., for the purpose, upon the condition that

POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE CO.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the municipal government should have the right to regulate the charges. By the amendment "any municipal
corporation may establish and operate public works
for

.

.

. telephone service" either by construction

or by purchase. It then goes on, "Persons or corporations may establish and operate works for supplying
the inhabitants with such service upon such conditions
and under such regulations as the municipality may
prescribe under its organic law, on condition that the
municipal government shall have the right to regulate
the charges thereof." We agree with the appellants
that the amendment seems intended as a step in the direction of municipal ownership or control. The words
'upon such conditions,' etc., are not to be confined to
police powers, which are conferred by § 11 of the same
article, but are of general import. If the municipal corporation does not see fit to establish the public works itself it may let others do it, but its power to impose conditions excludes the notion that the constitution alone
is a grant to others of a right to occupy the streets without its consent.
The claim founded upon the statutes seems to us
stronger. By § 536 of the Civil Code "Telegraph corporations may construct lines of telegraph along and upon
any public road or highway .
.
and may erect
poles . . . in such manner and at such points as

not to incommode the public use of the road." This is
treated by the Supreme Court of California as a grant
when acted upon. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hopkins, 116 Pac. Rep. 557. But as the words 'telegraph
corporations' have been construed not to include telophone corporations; Sunset Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.
.City of Pasadena, 118 Pac. Rep. 796; a construction that
we know no sufficient reason for not following; Yazoo &
Mississippi Valley R. R. Co. v. Adams, 181 U. S. 580;
Richmond v. Southern Bell Telephone & Telegraph Co.,

174 U. S. 761; ,he section until amended did the appellee
no good. On March 20, 1905, however, the section was
amended so as to include telephone corporations, so that,
if that were all, the case of the appellee would be clear,
the City of Pomona not having been organized under provisions of the constitution that withdrew certain cities
from the operation of general laws. See Ex parte Helm,
143 California, 553; Sunset Telephone & Telegraph Co. v.
Pasadena, 118 Pac. Rep. 796, 803.
But the amendment did not go into effect for sixty
days, and two days later, on March 22, a franchise act
was passed, to take effect immediately, providing that
"every franchise or privilege to erect or lay telegraph or
telephone wires, to construct or operate street or interurban railroads . . . or to exercise any other privilege whatever hereafter proposed to be granted" by the
legislative body of any county, city and county, city or
town, except telegraph or telephone lines doing an interstate business, should be granted upon the conditions
specified in the act and not otherwise. "Any applicant
for any franchise or privilege above mentioned" was required to file an application, there was to be an advertisement for bids, etc., with other particulars that need
not be specified, as the appellee does not claim under this
statute. It contends that this act establishes conditions
only for counties, cities and towns, and does not qualify
the grant from the State in the amended § 536. The appellant, on the other hand, argues that the franchise act
repealed § 536, so far as it affects this case, except as to
telephones doing an interstate business. In view of the
frame of the act as a whole, of a general repealing clause
at the end, naming certain. exceptions of which § 536 is
not one, and of the fact that the grant of such franchises.
seems generally to have been left to the local subdivisions
concerned, Sunset Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Pasadena,
118 Pac. Rep. 796, 803, we construe the words quoted as

POMONA v. SUNSET TELEPHONE CO.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of general application, and axe of opinion that they cannot be supposed to have had the narrow operation that
would be left to them if there were in force a grant from
the State of almost universal scope. Until the state
court shall decide otherwise we must take § 536 to have
been repealed, subject to the exception contained in the
later act, before any grant or right under it had accrued
to the appellee.
We come then to consider the extent of the exception.
This is not a question whether all telephones :having the
usual connections might not be instruments of commerce
among the States; it is not a question whether the State
could interfere with the local business of lines engaged in
such commerce. It is a question of how far the offer of a
grant that had not yet taken effect should be understood to
have been left on foot by the repealing act; a question
as to the meaning of words. In construing them it may
be assumed that the exception was made unwillingly.
No policy can be discovered that would be likely to induce
the making of it, and it is most easily explained by the
uncertainty then prevailing as to the power of the State
over telegraphs, etc., running into other States, in view
of the commerce clause of the Constitution and the act
of July 24, 1866; an uncertainty then lately and since
largely dispelled. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 195 U. S. 540. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Richmond, April 1, 1912. The words to be
interpreted are 'except telegraph or telephone lines doing
an interstate business.' The qualification 'doing an
interstate business' shows 'that not all telephones were
expected to benefit by the grant in § 536, and the limitation is presumably substantial. The legislature probably
supposed by mistake that it was bound to grant a right to
direct through lines but evidently meant to grant no more
than it must. It was understood so by the city. The order
and threat of the city were confined to poles and wires

doing a state and local business. This appears by the bill
and the finding of the Circuit Court, not disturbed above,
as to what actually was done. We are of opinion that
the city's interpretation was correct.
The result is that the appellee must be taken to have
a grant of the right to keep its main through lines in the
streets of Pomona, but not to maintain the posts and wires
by which it connects with subscribers. So far as appears
the city attacks only the latter, and therefore no present
ground is shown for the bill. But as the line of distinction may be delicate and questions may arise the bill will
be dismissed without prejudice.
Decree reversed.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE TERRITORY

OF

ARIZONA.
No. 102.

Argued December 13, 1911.-Decided April 8, 1912.

While liability under a surety bond for honesty of an employd would
be defeated if the loss was due to neglect of the employer to take
the precautions required by the bond, the condition is subsequent
and not precedent, and there is no occasion for an averment in respect
thereto; it is a matter of defense that must come from the other
side, upon whofn the onus rests.
Where the evidence, as in this case, shows that examinations were
made, it is for the jury to determine whether reasonable diligence
had been used in making them.
The certificate of correctness of employ6's accounts on obtaining renewals of surety bond for his honesty held in this case not to be a
