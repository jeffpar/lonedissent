CHOATE v. TRAPP, SECRETARY OF THE STATE
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF OKLAHOMA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF

OKL-AHOMA.
No. 809. Argued February 23, 1912.-Decided May 13, 1912.
There is a broad distinction between the power to abrogate a statute
and to destroy rights acquired under it; and while Congress, under
its plenary power over Indian tribes, can amend or repeal an agreement by a later statute, it cannot destroy actually existing individual
rights of property acquired under a former statute or agreement.
The individual Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian had no title or enforcible right in tribal property, but Congress recognized his equitable interest therein in the Curtis Act of June 28, 1898, 30 Stat.
505, and offered to give to him in consideration of his consenting to the *distribution an allotment of non-taxable land; and the
acceptance of the patent by each member of the tribe was on the
consideration of relinquishment of his interest in the unallotted
tribal property.
A patent for an Indian allotment containing an agreement assenting
to the plan of distribution, like a deed poll, bound the grantee,
although not- signed by him, and the benefits constituted the consideration for the rights waived.
The tax exemption in the patents for Indian allotments under the
Curtis Act was not a mere safeguard against alienation, and did not
fall with the removal of restrictions from alienation by the act of
May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312.
The removal of restrictions on alienation of Indian allotments falls
withi4 the power of Congress to regulate Indian affairs, but the provision for non-taxation is a property right and not subject to action
by Congress.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Counsel for Parties.

224 U. S.

The non-taxation provisions as to Indian allotted lands in the Curtis
Act gave a property right to the allottees, and was binding on the
State of Oklahoma.
Patents issued in pursuance of statute are to be construed in connection with the statute, and those issued to allottee Indians under
the Curtis Act gave the allottees as good a title to the exemption
from taxation as to the land itself; and the tax exemption constituted property of which the patentees could not, under the Fifth
Amendment, be deprived without due process of law.
An exemption from taxation, of land allotted to Indians in pursuance
of an agreement to distribute the tribal property, will not be construed strictly, as a gratuitous exemption to a public service corporation is ordinarily construed, but will be construed liberally under the
rule that all contracts with Indians are so construed.
The tax exemption provisions of the patents to Indian allottees under
the Curtis Act attached to the land for the limited period of the
exemption.
Indians are not excepted from the protection guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, but their rights are secured and enforced to the
same extent as those of other residents or citizens of the United
States.
Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, distinguished as not
involving property rights but only the right of Congress to extend
the period of disability to alienate the allotments, and as not intimating that Congress could by its wardship lessen any rights of
property actually vested in the individual Indian by prior laws or
contracts.
Oklahoma by its constitution has recognized the tax exemption in the
patents of allottee Indians, and, as a vested right, it cannot be
abrogated by statute.
28 Oklahoma, 517, reversed.

Chickasaw Indian allotted lands in Oklahoma while in
possession of the allottees, are stated in the opinion.

CHOATE v. TRAPP.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE LAMAR delivered the opinion of the court.

The eight thousand plaintiffs in this case are members
of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes. Each of them holds
a patent to 320 acres of allotted land issued under the
terms of the Curtis Act (June 28, 1898, 30 Stat. 495, 507,
c. 517), which contained a provision "that the land should
be non-taxable" for a limited time. Before the expiration
of that period the officers of the State of Oklahoma instituted proceedings with a view of assessing and collecting taxes on these lands lying within that State. The
plaintiffs' application for an injunction was denied.
In order to understand the issues presented by the writ
of error it is necessary to refer, as briefly as possible, to
certain well-known facts, and to material portions of
lengthy statutes, under which the tribal property of the
Choctaws and Chickasaws was divided in severalty among
their members.
The Five Civilized Tribes owned immense tracts of
land in territory that is now embraced within the limits
of the State of Oklahoma. The legal title was in the
Tribes for the common use of their members. But the
fact that so extensive an area was held under a system
that did not recognize private property in land, presented a serious obstacle to the creation of the State
which Congress desired to organize for the government
and development of that part of the country. And, with
a view of removing these difficulties, it provided (March 3,
1893, 27 Stat. 612, 645, c. 209) for the appointment of the
Dawes Commission, authorizing it to enter into negotiations with these Tribes for the extinguishment of their
title, either by cession to the United States or by allotmeht, in severalty, among their members. As might have
been anticipated, the Commission found that many of the
Indians were greatly opposed to any change. "Some of
them held passionately to their institutions from custom

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

.Opinion of the Court.

and patriotism, and others held with equal tenacity because of the advantages and privileges they enjoyed."
(20 H. R. Doc., 1903-4, p. 1.) After several years of
negotiations their opposition was so far overcome that
.provisional agreements were made which contemplated
most radical changes in the political and property rights
of the Indians.
On April 23, 1897, the Dawes Commission and the
Choctaw and Chickasaw representatives made what is
known as the Atoka Agreement. It was incorporated
bodily into the Curtis Act of June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. 505),
and was modified by the act of July 1, 1902 (32 Stat.
641, 657, c. 1362).
These two acts, containing what is known as the Atoka
Agreement and the Supplemental Agreement, provided
that Indian laws and courts should be at once abolished;
that there should be an enrollment of all the members of
the tribe; and that the members of the two tribes should
become citizens of the United States.
It was also provided, as appears from extracts copied in
the margin,' that. each member of the tribe should have
1 That all the lands allotted shall be non-taxable while the title remains in the original allottee, but not to exceed 21 years from date of

be inalienable for 21 years from date of patent.

land which shall have been allotted to him in conformity with the requirements of this agreement. . . . Said patent shall be framed
in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. . . . And

allotted to him his share of the land-all of which "shall
be non-taxable while the title remains in the original
allottee;" that a part of the land could be sold after one
year and all of it sold after five years; that the patents

issued to the allottee "should be framed in conformity
with the provisions of the Agreement," and that the acceptance of such patent should be operative as an assent
on his part to the allotment of all land of the tribes in

accordance with the provisions of the Agreement, and as
a relinquishment of all his interest in other parts of the
common property.

The complaint does not state when the plaintiffs received their patents, but the report of the Dawes Coinassent on his part to the allotment and conveyance of all the lands of
the Choctaws and Chickasaws in accordance with the provisions of
this agreement, and as a relinquishment of all his right, title and interest in and to any and all parts thereof, excepting the land embraced
in said patent, and excepting also his interest in the proceeds of all
lands, coal and asphalt herein excepted from allotment. (Atoka
Agreement, 30 Stat. 507.)
There shall be allotted to each member of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Tribes, as soon as practicable after the approval by the Secretary
of the Interior of his enrollment as herein provided, land equal in value
to 320 acres of the average allottable land of the nation,
Each member of said tribes shall at the time of the selection of his
allotment, designate as a homestead out of the said allotment land
equal in value to 160 acres of the average allottable land of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nation, as near as may be, which shall be inalienable during the lifetime of the allottee, not exceeding 21 years
from the date of the certificate of allotment, and a separate certificate
and patent shall issue for said homestead. (642.)
All lands allotted to the members of said tribes, except such land as
is set aside to each for a homestead as herein provided, shall be alienable after the issuance of patent as follows:
One-fourth in acreage in one year, one-fourth in acreage in three
years, and the balance in five years; in each case from the date of
patent; provided that such land shall not be alienable by allottee, or
his heirs, at any time before the expiration of the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribal government for less than its appraised value. (643.)

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

224 U. S.

mission for the year ending June 1, 1904 (20 H. R. Doc.,
27-42), shows that the enrollment and allotment had so
far progressed as to make it fair to assume that most, if
not all, of the patents had been issued, and that much of
the land was alienable and all of it was non-taxable when,
on November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted into the
Union. The constitution of that State provided that all
existing rights should continue as if no change in government had taken place, and that property exempt from
taxation by virtue of treaties and Federal laws should so
remain during the force and effect of such treaties or
Federal laws.
No taxes were assessed against the lands of the plaintiffs for the year 1907, but on May 27, 1908 (35 Stat. 312,
c. 199), Congress passed a general act removing restrictions from the sale and encumbrance of land held by
Indians of the class to which the plaintiffs belong. Another section provided that lands from which restrictions
had been removed should be subject to taxation.
Thereupon proceedings were instituted by the State of
Oklahoma with a view of assessing the plaintiffs' lands
for taxes. This they sought to enjoin, but their complaint
was dismissed on demurrer. The case was carried to the
Supreme Court of the State which held that Oklahoma
was not a party to any contract with the Indians; that
the United States, by virtue of its governmental power
over the Indians, could have substituted title in severalty
for ownership in common without plaintiffs' consent and
that, for want of a consideration, the provision that the
land should be non-taxable was not a contract, but a
mere gratuity which could be withdrawn at will. The
court thereupon overruled plaintiffs' contention that they
had a vested right of exemption which prevented the State
from taxing the land at this time and dismissed their suit.
1. There are many cases, some of which are cited in the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma (Thomas v.

CHOATE v. TRAPP.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Gay, 169 U. S. 264, 271; Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S.
553, 565), recognizing that the plenary power of Congress
over the Indian Tribes and tribal property cannot be
limited by treaties so as to prevent repeal or amendment
by a later statute. The Tribes have been regarded as
dependent nations, and treaties with them have been
looked upon not as contracts, but as public laws which
could be abrogated at the will of the United States.
This sovereign and plenary power was exercised and
retained in all the dealings and legislation under which the
lands of the Choctaws and Chickasaws were divided in
severalty among the members of the Tribes. For, although the Atoka Agreement is in the form of a contract
it is still an integral part of the Curtis Act, and, if not a
treaty, is a public law relating to tribal property, and as
such was amendable and repealable at the will of Congress. But there is a broad distinction between tribal
property and private property, and between the power to
abrogate a statute and the authority to destroy rights
acquired under such law. Reichert v. Felps, 6 Wall. 160.
The question in this case, therefore, is not whether the
plaintiffs were parties to the Atoka Agreement, but
whether they had not acquired rights under the Curtis
Act which axe now protected by the Constitution of the
United States.
2. The individual Indian had no title or enforcible
right in the tribal property. But as one of those entitled
to occupy the land he did have an equitable interest,
which Congress recognized and which it desired, to have
satisfied and extinguished. The Curtis Act was framed
with a view of having every such claim satisfactorily
settled. And though it provided for a division of the land
in severalty, it offered a patent of non-taxable land only
to those who would relinquish their claim in the other
property of the Tribe formerly held for their common use.
For, the Atoka Agreement, after declaring that "all land

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

allotted should be non-taxable," stipulated further that
each enrolled member of the Tribes should receive a
patent framed in conformity with the Agreement, and
that each Choctaw and Chickasaw who accepted such
patent should be held thereby to assent to the terms of
this Agreement and to relinquish all of his right in the
property formerly held in common.
There was here, then, an offer of non-taxable land. Acceptance by the party to whom the offer was made, with
the consequent relinquishment of all claim to other lands
furnished a part of the consideration, if, indeed, any was
needed, in such a case, to support either the grant or the
exemption. Wisconsin &c. R. R. v. Powers, 191 U. S.
379, 386; Home v. Rouse, 8 Wall. 430, 437; Tomlinson v.
Jessup, 15 Wall. 454, 458. Upon delivery of the patent
the agreement was executed, and the Indian was thereby
vested with all the right conveyed by the patent, and, like
a grantee in a deed poll, or a person accepting the benefit
of a conveyance, bound by its terms, although it was not
actually signed by him. Keller v. Ashford, 133 U. S. 610,
621; Hendrick v. Lindsay, 93 U. S. 143..
As the plaintiffs were offered the allotments on the conditions proposed; as they accepted the terms and, in the
relinquishment of their claim, furnished a consideration
which was sufficient to entitle them to enforce whatever
rights were conferred, we are brought to a consideration
of the question as to what those rights were.
3. On the part of the State it is argued that there was,
in fact, no tax exemption, but that that provision was
only intended to guard absolutely. against alienation of
the land, whether for taxes, or at judicial sale, or by private
contract. In other words, it is said that the tax exemption
was only an additional prohibition against a sale, so that
when the restrictions against alienation were removed by
the act of 1908 (35 Stat. 312), the provision as to nontaxability went as a necessary part thereof.

CHOATE v. TRAPP.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

But the exemption and non-alienability were two
separate and distinct subjects. One conferred a right and
the other imposed a limitation. The defendant's argument also ignores the fact that, in this case, though the
land could be sold after five years it might remain nontaxable for 16 years longer, if the Indian retained title
during that length of time. Restrictions on alienation
were removed by lapse of time. He could sell part after
one year, a part after three years and all except homestead after five years. The period of exemption was not
co-incident with this five-year limitation. On the contrary the privilege of non-taxability might last for 21
years, thus recognizing that the two subjects related to
different periods and that neither was dependent on the
other. The right to remove the restriction was in pursuance of the power under which Congress could legislate
as to the status of the ward and lengthen or shorten the
period of disability. But the provision that the land
should be non-taxable was a property right, which Congress undoubtedly had the power to grant. That right
fully vested in the Indians and was binding upon Oklahoma. Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737, 756; United States
v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432.
4. The record contains no copy of any of the patents
under which the plaintiffs hold. But the act provided
that they should be framed in conformity with the Atoka
Agreement. Those who signed the patent could not convey more rights than were granted by that part of the
Curtis Act, nor could they, by omission, deprive the patentee of any exemption to which he was thereby entitled.
The patent and the legislation of Congress must be construed together, and when so construed they show that
Congress, in consideration of the Indians' relinquishment
of all claim to the common property, and for other satisfactory reasons, made a grant of land which should be
non-taxable for a limited period. The patent issued in
VOL. ccxxiv-43

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

pursuance of those statutes gave the Indian as good a
title to the exemption as it did to the land itself. Under
the provisions of the Fifth Amendment there was no more
power to deprive him of the exemption than of any other
right in the property. No statute would have been valid
which reduced his fee to a life estate, or attempted to take
from him ten acres, or fifty acres, or the timber growing
on the land. After he accepted the patent the Indian
could not be heard, either at law or in equity, to assert any
claim to the common property. If he is bound, so is the
tribe and the Government when the patent was issued.
5. It is conceded that no right which was actually conferred on the Indians can be arbitrarily abrogated by
statute. But as it is claimed that he, in fact, acquired no
valid exemption, since it stands on a different footing from
the grant of the land itself; and that, though the provision
of non-taxability added to the value of the property, it
can be withdrawn because, if not a gratuity, it is at least
subject to the general rule that tax exemptions are to be
strictly construed and are subject to repeal unless the contrary clearly appears. Welch v. Cook, 97 U. S. 541; Christ
Church v. Philadelphia,24 How. 300; Wisconsin &c. R. R.
v. Powers, 191 U. S.379; Tucker v. Ferguson, 22 Wall.
527; West Wisconsin Ry. v. Board of Supervisors, 93 U. S.
595, are cited in support of this proposition. Some of
these cases construe general statutes containing, not a
grant, but an offer of exemption to such companies as
should do certain work or build certain lines of road before
a given date. They hold that a statute making such an
offer might be repealed even as against those companies
which actually built in reliance on.its terms. But these
rulings are based on the theory that "the legislature was
not making promises, but framing a scheme of public
revenue and public improvement," (Wisconsin &c. v.
Powers, 191 U. S. 387). The companies gave nothing and
the State received nothing in exchange for the offer. There

CHOATE v. TRAPP.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

was no consideration moving from one to the other. Such
exemption was a mere bounty, valuable as long as the
State chose to concede it, but as tax exemptions are strictly
construed, it could be withdrawn at any time the State
saw fit.
6. But in the Government's dealings with the Indians
the rule is exactly the contrary. The construction, instead of being strict, is liberal; doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the United States, are
to be resolved in favor of a weak and defenseless people,
who are wards of the nation, and dependent wholly upon
its protection and good faith. This rule of construction
has been recognized, without exception, for more than a
hundred years and has been applied in tax cases.
For example, in Kansas Indians, 5 Wall.'737, 760, the
question was whether a statute prohibiting levy and sale
of Indian lands prevented a sale for state taxes. The rule
of strict construction would have compelled a holding that
the property was liable. But Mr. Justice Davis, in speaking for the court, said that "enlarged rules of construction
are adopted in reference to Indian treaties." He quoted
from Chief Justice Marshall, who said that "The language
used in treaties with the Indians shall never be construed
to their prejudice, if words be made use of susceptible of
a more extending meaning . . ." Again, in Jones v.
Meehan, 175 U. S. 1, it was held that "Indian treaties
must be construed, not according to the technical meaning
of their words, but in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the Indians." In view of the universality of this rule, Congress is conclusively presumed to
have intended that the legislation under which these allotments were made to the Indians should be liberally construed in their favor in determining the rights granted to
the Choctaws and Chickasaws.
The provision that "all land shall be non-taxable"
naturally indicates that the exemption is attached to the

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

land--only an artificial rule can make it a personal privilege. But if there is any conflict between the natural
meaning and the technical construction,-if there were
room for doubt, or if there were any question as to whether
this was a personal privilege and repealable, or an incident
attached to the land itself for a limited period, that doubt,
under this rule, must be resolved'in favor of the patentee.
The decision in New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Cranch, 164,
is directly in point here and especially as to the quality of
the exemption. It appeared there that the Delaware
Indians had claims to lands in that State lying south of
the River Rariton. An agreement for a release of the
claim was made between the Commissioners and the Indians, under which the latter were to receive a conveyance
to a large body of land in fee. The agreement was approved by the State by an act which, among other things,
declared that the land "should not hereafter be subject
toanytax:" The Indians, after many years, sold the land,
and the State subsequently passed a statute repealing the
exemption. This court, speaking by Chief Justice Marshall, held that "every requisite to the formation of a contract is found in the proceedings between the then colony of
New Jersey and the Indians. The subject was a purchase
on the part of the Government of extensive claims of the
Indians, the extinguishment of which would quiet the
title to a large portion of the province. A proposition to
this effect was made, the terms stipulated, the consideration agreed upon, which is a tract of land with the privilege of exemption from taxation; and then, in consideration of the arrangement previously made, one of which this
Act of Assembly is stated to be, the Indians executed their
deed of cession. This is certainly a contract clothed with
forms of unusual solemnity. The privilege, though for
the benefit of the Indians, is annexed by the terms which
create it, to the land itself, not to their persons." And it
was thereupon held that the right was not affected by the

. CHOATE v. TRAPP.
224 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

later statute repealing the exemption. The case here is
much stronger. For the tax exemption, which adds value
to the property, is not perpetual, but is attached to the
land only so long as the Indian retains the title, and in no
event to exceed twenty-one years. It is property, and
entitled to protection as such, unless the fact that the
owner is an Indian subject to restrictions as to alienation
made a difference.
7. There have been comparatively few cases which discuss the legislative power over private property held by
the Indians. But those few all recognize that he is not
excepted from the protection guaranteed by the Constitution. His private rights are secured and enforced to the
same extent and in the same way as other residents or citizens of the United States. In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, 504;
Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294, 307; Smith
v. Goodell, 20 Johns. (N. Y.) 188; Lowry v. Weaver, 4 McLean, 82; Whirlwind v. Von der Ahe, 67 Mo. App. 628;
Taylor v. Drew, 21 Arkansas, 485, 487. His right of private
property is not subject to impairment by legislative action,
even while he is, as a member of a tribe and subject to the
guardianship of the United States as to his political and
personal status. This was clearly recognized in the leading
case of Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1. There it appeared
that an Indian Chief owned in fee land which fronted on a
stream. The chief died, and in 1891 his son and heir, during the continuance of the tribal organization, let the land
to Meehan for ten years. In 1894 he again let the same
property to Jones for twenty years. In that year the
Secretary of the Interior was authorized by Congress to
approve the lease to Jones if the latter would increase the
rental. This he did, and with the assent of the Indian
and the Secretary of the Interior. a lease was made to
Jones. In the litigation which followed Meehan relied
on the first contract made in the exercise of the Indian's
right of private ownership. Jones relied on that made

224 U.S.

under congressional authority, and although the Indian
was a member of the tribe and much more subject to legislative power than these plaintiffs, the court held that the
subsequent act could not relate back so as to interfere
with the right of property which the Indian possessed and
conveyed as an owner in fee, and while Congress had
power to make. treaties, it could not affect titles already
granted by the treaty itself.
Nothing that was said in Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,
221 U. S. 286, is opposed to the same conclusion here. For
that case did not involve property rights, but related solely
to the power of Congress, to extend the period of the Indian's disability. The statute did not attempt to take his
land or any right, member or appurtenance thereunto belonging. It left that as it was. But, having regard to the
Indian's inexperience, and desiring to protect him against
himself and those who might take advantage of his incapacity, Congress extended the time during which he
could not sell. On that subject, after calling attention to
the fact that "Tiger was still a ward of the Nation, so far
as the alienation of these lands was concerned, and a member of the existing Creek Nation," it was said that "Incompetent persons, though citizens, may not have the full
right to control their property," and that there was nothing in citizenship incompatible with guardianship, or with
restricting sales by Indians deemed by Congress incapable
of managing their estates.
But there was no intimation that the power of wardship
conferred authority on Congress to lessen any of the rights
of property which had been vested in the individual Indian
by prior laws or contracts. Such rights are protected from
repeal by the provisions of the Fifth Amendment.
The constitution of the State of Oklahoma itself expressly recognizes that the exemption here granted must
be protected until it is lawfully destroyed. We have seen
that it was a 'vested property right which could not be
