the exclusive control of the defendant, and the injury is
such as in the ordinary course of things does not occur if
the one having such control uses proper care, it affords
reasonable evidence, in the absence of an explanation, that
the injury arose from the defendant's want of care. Inland

4. Complaint is made of the court's refusal to give
several instructions requested by the defendant. All have
been examined, and we find no error in their refusal.
Some were in substance incorporated in the charge, some
were inapplicable to the case before the jury, and others
did not correctly state the law.
Judgment affirmed.

CAMPBELL v. UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. 161.

Argued March 6, '1912.-Decided March 18, 1912.

As §§ 566, 649 and 700, Rev. Stat., do not make any provisions for such
a case, the trial of a case in the District Court of the United States
without a jury is in the nature of a submission to an arbitrator, and
the court's determination of issues of fact and questions of law supposed to arise on its special findings is not a judicial determination,
and, therefore, not subject to reexamination in an appellate court.
In such a case the Circuit Court of Appeals has no power to consider
the sufficiency of facts found to support the judgment, but is limited
to a consideration of such questions of law as are presented by the

record proper independently of the special finding; and, in the absence of any such independent questions, must affirm..
An objection to form of pleading that can be cured by amendment
should be seasonably taken on the trial.
Where a statement in the answer that defendant had not and could not
obtain sufficient information upon which to base a belief respecting
the truth of an allegation in the complaint is not objected to in the
trial court as an insufficient denial of the allegation but is treated as
sufficient, the objection cannot be made in an appellate court, and

the truth of the allegation must be regarded as at issue.
170 Fed. Rep. 318, reversed.
THE

facts are stated in the opinion.

Mr. A. B. Browne, with whom Mr. Gerald Hughes,
Mr. Alexander Britton, Mr. Evans Browne, Mr. Clayton
C. Dorsey and Mr. Barnwell S. Stuart were on the brief,
for plaintiffs in error:
There was no jurisdiction in the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals to review and reverse the judgment of
the District Court.
In actions at law in the courts of the United States, if
the questions of fact are, by the consent of the parties,
determined by the court without a jury, no ruling made
upon or in connection with the trial can be reviewed by
the Court of Appeals upon writ of error in the absence of
a statute providing otherwise. Rogers v. United States,
141 U. S. 548; United States v. Cleague, 161 Fed. Rep. 85,
86; United States v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 167 Fed. Rep.
306, 308; United States v. St. Louis, I. M. & S. Ry. Co.,
169 Fed. Rep. 73, 74, 76.
The question of jurisdiction is one which the court will
determine regardless of whether it was raised or suggested
by the parties. Cutler v. Rae, 7 How. 729; Mansfield,
Coldwater &c. Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S. 379, 382; Parker
v. Ormeby, 141 U. S. 81, 85; Perez v. Fernandez, 202 U. S.
80, 100; Dones v. Urrutia,202 U. Si 614.
The same rule obtains in the Circuit Courts of Appeals

in cases appealed or brought by writ of error to those
courts. Where the jurisdiction is found not to be conferred by the Constitution and laws, objection thereto
cannot be waived by the parties. Henrie v. Henderson,
145 Fed. Rep. 316; Fred Macey Co. v. Macey, 135 Fed.
Rep. 725, 726; Cochran v. Childs, 111 Fed. Rep. 433;
Wetherby v. Stinson, 62 Fed. Rep. 173; Tinsley v. Hart,
53 Fed. Rep. 682.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is not
warranted by the facts and the principles of law applicable thereto.
Not only by virtue of the notice were these sureties released but by the necessary consqquences which must be
deemed to result from the action which they took.
The sureties did all they could do in the performance of
their obligations to the Government and gave the latter
the opportunity to prevent any and all loss, and this
opportunity was recognized and accepted by the Government, with which latter the rules and principles of fair
dealings in its contractual relations with an individual
must be held to obtain and be of equal force as in the case
of dealing and contractual relations between individuals.
Burgess v. Eve, L. R. 13 Eq. Cases, 450, 457; Phillips v.
Foxall, L. R. 7 Q. B. 766.
The principle contended for by plaintiff in error as
applicable, and upon which, in the case at bar, the sureties
should be held to have fully performed their obligation
and to' be released from further liability, has been recognized and followed in the United States. See Walsh v.
Colquitt, 64 Georgia, 740; Emery v. Baltz, 94 N. Y. 408;
Dwellinghouse Ins. Co. v. Johnston, 90 Michigan, 170;
Rapp v. Phoenix Ins. Co., 113 Illinois, 390, 402; Lewiston
v. Gagne, 89 Maine, 395.
Anderson v. Blair can be distinguished, and see United
States v, Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720; United States v. Van
Zandt, 11 Wheat. 184; Dox v. Postmaster General, 1 Pet.

318; Jones v. United States, 18 Wall. 662; Hart v. United
States, 95 U. S. 315.
The case at bar has clearly exceptional features; and
see 2 Brandt on Suretyship, § 555.
When sureties take notice of the principal's default,
and with diligence discover his misconduct and do all
that is within their power to perform their contract to
see that the principal faithfully and without default performs his duty, the performance being complete, the
obligation should cease to exist. See 2 Parsons on Contracts, p. 31.
The Government -could have inunediately dismissed
Westcott without injury, and when it acted upon the
notifications of the sureties and took charge of his office,
and found that he had been guilty of misconduct and
knew that the sureties were unwilling and refused to remain longer liable upon the bond, it was then and there
its duty to dismiss Westcott unless he provided new and
adequate sureties for the performance of his duties.
There is no question that the bond is revocable.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Denison for the United
States:
The bond itself contained no provision that the sureties
should be released by any laches on the part of government officers.
The decision of the District Court on the question of
law was directly contrary to at least eight decisions of
this court. United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720;
United States v. Vanzandt, 11 Wheat. 184; Dox v. Postmaster General, 1 Pet. 318; Jones v. United States, 18
Wall. 662; Hart v. United States, 95 U. S. 316; Minturn v.
United States, 106 U. S. 437; Fidelity &c. Co. v. Courtney,
186 U. S. 361; German Bank v. United States, 148 U. S.
573; United States v. Sisk, 176 Fed. Rep. 886.
As the facts found by the District Judge did not legally

support the judgment, Rogers v. United States, 141 U. S.
548, does not apply and the Circuit Court of Appeals had
jurisdiction to reverse for this error of law. Andes v.
Slauson, 130 U. S. 435; Campbell v. Boyreau, 21 How. 223;
Paine v' Cent. Vt. R. R. Co., 118 U. S. 152.
But errors made apparent by a scrutiny of the pleadings
also afford a basis for review. Cases supra and O'Reilly v.
Brooke, 209 U. S. 45; Lyons v. Nat. Bank, 19 Blatchf. 287;
Doty v. Jewett, 22 Blatchf. 65; Bond v. Dustin, 112 U. S.

Tweed, 9 Wall. 425; Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125; Blair
v. Allen, 3 Dillon, 101; Wear v. Mayer; 2 McCrary, 172.
As to the pleadings the District Court erred in overruling the Government's demurrer to the separate defense
of laches. Lyons v. Nat. Bank, supra.
Also the first defense did not present any valid issue
under the laws of the State of Colorado, the denials being
in part mere conclusions of law. Gale v. James, 11 Colorado, 540, 541; Pueblo v. Gould, 6 Colo. App. 44; Bliss
Code Pleading, § 334, and cases cited, and in part negative pregnant; Chitty on Pleading, § 566; Harden v.
Atchison &c. R. Co., 4 Nebraska, 521; Moses v. Jenkins, 50
Oregon, 447.
As to the balance they were defective because they
denied not "knowledge or informiation" but only "information." See Downing v. North Denver Land Co., 30
Colorado, 283; Haney v. People, 12 Colorado; 345; James
v. McGhee, 9 Colorado, 486; Grand Valley Ins. Co. v.
Lesher, 28 Colorado, 273.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

The first defense was also sham because its denial was
only of information in regard to the defalcation, which in
this case was a matter of public record accessible to the
defendants. Patrick v. McManus, 14 Colorado, 65; Simpson v. Langley, 23 Colorado, 69; Fravert v. Fesler, 11
Colo. App. 387; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co., 18
How. 276; Kennedy v. McGary, 21 Wisconsin, 496; Van
Dyke v. Doherty, 6 N. Dak. 263; Wallace v. Bacon, 86 Fed.

24; Thompson v. Skeen, 14 Utah, 209; Appel v. State, 9
Wyoming, 187; Ency. P1. & Pr., Vol. 1, 813.
Looking broadly at the case it is beyond question that
the sole point in controversy was the validity of the defense of laches and on that question the District Court's
judgment was plainly in error and should be reversed.
O'Reilly v. Brooke, and Supervisors v. Kennicott, supra.
The District Judge was never intended to be constituted
an arbitrator even of the facts and if a determination of
facts should be deemed requisite the case, should be remanded with instructions to make the determination by
correct proceedings as a court. Flanders v. Tweed, 9
Wall. 425; Low v. United States, and Prentice v. Zane, 8
How. 470, supra.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER

delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was an action at law against the sureties on the
official bond of a receiver of public moneys to recover for
a default of their prihcipal. The answer set forth that
the defendants had not and could not obtain sufficient
information upon which to base a belief respecting the
'default charged and therefore denied the same, and also
interposed an affirmative defense, which need not be

Opinion of the Court.

specially noticed. The action was begun in the District
Court, and was tried to thb court without a jury. There
was a special finding of the facts, accompanied by conclusions of law, and upon these there was a judgment for
the defendants. The plaintiff took the case on writ of
error to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the
facts found were insufficient to support the judgment,
and reversed the latter with a direction to enter a judgment for the plaintiff upon the finding. 170 Fed. Rep.
318. The defendants then sued out the present writ of
error.
At the outset we are confronted with the question of
the power of the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider the
sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.
Section 566, Rev. Stat., provided that the trial of issues
of fact in the District Courts, in all cases except cases in
equity and cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,
and except as otherwise provided in proceedings in bankruptcy, should be by jury. This was not one of the excepted cases. Sections 649 and 700, Rev. Stat., made
special provision for the trial by the court, without a jury,
of the issues of fact in actions at law in the Circuit Courts,
and for the review of the rulings of the court in the progress
of such a trial, including the question of the sufficiency of
the facts found to support the judgment; but those sections were in terms limited to cases in the Circuit Courts,
and there was no similar provision in respect of cases in
the District Courts. In this state of the statute law the
trial to the District Court without a jury was in the nature
of a submission to an arbitrator, a mode of trial not contemplated by law, and the court's determination of the
issues of fact and of the questions of law supposed to arise
upon its special finding was not a judicial determination
and therefore was not subject, to reexamination in an
appellate court. Campbell v. Boyreau, 21 How. 223;
Rogers v. United States, 141 U. S. 548. It follows that the

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

224 U. S.

Circuit Court of Appeals was without power to consider
the sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment.
The power of that court was limited to a consideration
of such questions of law as may have been presented by
the record proper, independently of the special finding,
such as whether the pleadings were sufficient to support
the judgment. It'is now said that such a question was
presented, and that its right solution required that the
judgment of the District Court be reversed. If the answer
did not put in issue, the allegation of the complaint respecting the default of the principal in the bond, this
claim is well founded; otherwise it is not. The denial of
that allegation was predicated upon a statement that the
defendants had not and could not obtain "sufficient information" upon which to base a belief respecting its
truth. This, it is said, was not an adequate denial, because the state statute (Colo. Code, § 62) required that
such a denial be based upon a disavowal of "sufficient
knowledge or information." But of this it is enough to
say that no such objection was raised in the District
Court, but, on the contrary, the answer was treated us
sufficient in that respect. This being so, the plaintiff was
not at liberty to raise the objection in an appellate court.
Had it been made seasonably it could, and doubtless
would, have been avoided by an amendment. Roberts v.
Graham, 6 Wall. 578, 581; Nashua Savings Bank v. AngloAmerican Co., 189 U. S. 221, 231.
It results that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in not
affirming the judgment of the District Court.
Judgment reversed.
