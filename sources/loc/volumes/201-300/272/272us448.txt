OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Counsel for Parties.

Nor were the representatives of the War Department
chargeable as a matter of law with knowledge, which they
did not in fact possess, of a tariff which was not required
to be filed. The ordinary consequences that attend the
filing of a schedule of rates with the Interstate Commerce
Commission as demanded or permitted by statute, cf.
Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Mugg, 202 U. S. 242; Chicago
& Alton R. R. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155, cannot be invoked
by the carrier merely because it lodged a special tariff with
the commission without statutory authorization. Illinois Central R. R. v. The United States, 58 Ct. Cls. 182.
Petitioner is in no better situation with respect to its
asserted right to recover the reasonable value of its services. The burden was upon it to establish their value.
The record contains no finding of the reasonable value of
these services, and petitioner failed, as the court below
found, to offer any proof of the reasonableness of the rate
which it sought to apply.
Judgment affirmed.

v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 243.

Argued October 13, 1926.-Decided November 22, 1926.

1. An inquiry, put by the trial judge to a jury unable to agree, asking
the extent of its division numerically, is per se ground for reversal.

P. 449.
2. Failure of counsel to particularize an exception to such an inquiry
does not preclude this Court from correcting the error. P. 450.
8 F. (2d) 472, reversed.

CERTIORARI (269 U. S. 550) to a judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals affirming a conviction in a prosecution
for conspiracy.

BRASFIELD v. UNITED STATES.
448

Opinion of the Court.

Assistant to the Attorney General Donovan, with whom
Solicitor General Mitchell and Mr. William D. Whitney,
Special Assistant to the Attorney General, were on the
brief, for the United States.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioners were convicted in the District Court for
northern California of the offense (ยง 37 of the Criminal
Code) of conspiracy to possess and transport intoxicating
liquors in violation of the National Prohibition Act. The
oonviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit. 8 Fed. (2d) 472. This Court granted certiorari. 269 U. S. 550; Jud. Code, ยง 240(a) as amended.
The only errors assigned which are pressed upon us concern proceedings had upon the recall of the jury after
its retirement. The jury having failed to agree after some
hours of deliberation, the trial judge inquired how it was
divided numerically, and was informed by the foreman
that it stood nine to three, without his indicating which
number favored a conviction.
In Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 307, where a
conviction was reversed on other grounds, this Court condemned the practice of inquiring of a jury unable to agree,
the extent of its numerical division, although a response
indicating the vote in favor of or against conviction was
neither sought nor obtained. This Court then said (p.
308):
" . . . we do not think that the proper administration
of the law requires such knowledge or permits such a question on the part of the presiding judge."
There is a diversity of view in the circuit courts of
appeals whether non-compliance with the rule as stated
in the Burton case is reversible error, or whether the expressions in that opinion are hortatory only. See St. Louis
& S. F. R. R. v. Bishard (C. C. A. 8th), 147 Fed. 496;
Stewart v. United States (C. C. A. 8th), 300 Fed. 769, 782,
et seq.; Nigro v. United States (C. C. A. 8th), 4 Fed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

272 U. S.

(2d) 781, holding that the inquiry requires a reversal; and
compare Bernal v. United States (C. C. A. 5th), 241 Fed.
339, 342; Quong Duck v. United States (C. C. A. 9th),
293 Fed. 563, 564, supporting the view that the practice,
while improper, is not prejudicial error.
We deem it essential to the fair and impartial conduct
of the trial, that the inquiry itself should be regarded as
ground for reversal. Such procedure serves no useful purpose that cannot be attained by questions not requiring the
jury to reveal the nature or extent of its division. Its
effect upon a divided jury will often depend upon circumstances which cannot properly be known to the trial
judge or to the appellate courts and may vary widely in
different situations, but in general its tendency is coercive.
It can rarely be resorted to without bringing to bear in
some degree, serious although not measurable, an improper influence upon the jury, from whose deliberations
every consideration other than that of the evidence and
the law as expounded in a proper charge, should be excluded. Such a practice, which is never useful and is generally harmful, is not to be sanctioned.
The failure of petitioners' counsel to particularize an
exception to the court's inquiry does not preclude this
Court from correcting the error. Cf. Wiborg v. United
States, 163 U. S. 632, 658, et seq.; Clyatt v. United States,
197 U. S. 207, 220, et seq.; Crawford v. United States, 212
U. S. 183, 194; Weems v.'United States, 217 U. S. 349, 362.
This is especially the case where the error, as here, affects
the proper relations of the court to the jury, and cannot
be effectively remedied by modification of the judge's
charge after the harm has been done.
It is unnecessary to consider other assignments of error
directed to the instructions given the jury at the time of its
recall.
Judgment reversed.
