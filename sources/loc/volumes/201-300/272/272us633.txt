Statement of the Case.

Chantangco v. Abaroa, 218 U. S. 476. The Government
may have failed to prove the appellants guilty and yet
may have been and may be able to prove that a nuisance
exists in the place. Our answer to the question certified
agrees with the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Kansas in a carefully considered case, State v. Roach, 83
Kan. 606.
Answer: No.
UNITED STATES v. McELVAIN ET AL.
ERROR TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS.

No. 266.

Submitted October 21, 1926.-Decided December 6, 1926.

1. An indictment, under § 37 of the Criminal Code, for a conspiracy
to defraud the United States in respect of its internal revenue by
making a false income and profits tax return, is not subject to the
statute of limitations for offenses "arising under the internal revenue laws," (Act of July 5, 1884, as amended), but to the three
year limitation imposed by Rev. Stats. § 1044. P. 638.
2. A proviso was added to Rev. Stats. § 1044, by the Act of November
17, 1921, 42 Stat. 220, viz., "That in offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to*defraud the United States or any agency
thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and in any manner, and
now indictable under any existing statutes, the period of limitation
shall be six years." Held:
(1) The purpose of the proviso is to carve out a special class
of cases, and it must be confined, by a strict construction, to the
cases clearly within its purpose. P. 639.
(2) If the proviso relates to any conspiracies under Crim. Code
§ 37, it is limited to those to commit the substantive offenses which
it covers. It does not apply to a conspiracy to defraud the United
States in respect of internal revenue. P. 639.
Affirmed.

to defraud the United States in respect of its internal
revenue.
Solicitor General Mitchell, Assistant Attorney General
Willebrandt, and Mr. Sewall Key, Attorney in the Department of Justice, for the United States, submitted.
The six-year period of limitations prescribed by the Act
of November 17, 1921, and not the three-year period in
§ 1321 of the Act of 1921, applies to the crime of conspiracy to defraud the United States in its internal revenue, in violation of § 37 of the Penal Code.
United States v. Noveck, 271 U. S. 201, makes it obvious that the ruling below is erroneous. That case is
decisive of the point that the three-year period of limitations prescribed in § 1321 of the Revenue Act of 1921,
supra, for "offenses arising under the internal revenue

laws" can have no application to the case at bar. Other
cases to the effect that a crime arises under the law by
which' it is defined and punished are United States v.
Hirsch, 100 U. S. 33, and United States v. Rabinowich,
238 U. S. 78.
The reasoning in the Noveck case applies with full
force here. If the Act of November 17, 1921, applies
to perjury, it likewise applies to conspiracy. In the
offense of conspiracy to defraud the United States of
revenue, unlike perjury, under the rule of the Noveck
case, the six-year period of the Act applies, because "defrauding or an attempt to defraud the United States is
an ingredient under the statute defining the offense."
The six-year period prescribed by the Act of November
17, 1921, is not limited to offenses involving the defrauding of the United States growing out of the war.
Mr. John, J. Healy for defendants in error, submitted.
Mr. John H. S. Lee was also on the brief.
Congress did not include the crime charged in this indictment within the provisions of the amendment of

Argument for Defendants in Error.

November 17, 1921, which was, by its express terms, one
merely purporting to amend § 1044 Rev. Stats., theretofore existing. This section, it will be observed, from its
earliest inception, had never included within its terms or
purview offenses under the Revenue Act. This will appear from a glance at the various sections of the statutes
of limitations governing the prosecution of the criminal
cases in the federal courts. Revised Statutes, §§ 1043,
1044, 1046. When Congress, by the Act of November 17,
1921, purported to amend merely § 1044, it would seem
clear that it had no intention also to amend § 1046; that
is, it had no intention to change the limitation fixed by
§ 1046 for the prosecution of offenses under the Revenue
Act, and had no intention to bring within § 1044, as
amended, the prosecution of any such offenses. But this
is not all. In the amendment of November 17, 1921,
Congress is careful again to indicate its purpose to exclude
from the scope of the amendment offenses existing under
the Revenue Act.
A proviso must be construed with reference to the subject matter of the paragraph or sentence to which it is
appended, unless it clearly appears from a consideration
of the entire Act that the legislative body intended that
it should have a broader and more independent operation.

Congressional debates and conunittee reports are competent for the purpose of showing the history of the times
or the evil which the statute was intended to remedy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1926.
Opinion of the Court.

272 U. S.

The various Acts of limitations are in par! materia.
However broad the language of a statute or some of its
expressions may be, yet if on examination it shall appear
that they were intended to be limited by other provisions
of the same or other Acts on the same subject, it will not
be improper to restrain them accordingly. Church v.
United States, supra; The Elizabeth, 8 Fed. Cas. No.
4352; Kohlsaat v. Murphy, 96 U. S. 153; United States
v. Ewing, 237 U. S. 197.
If the proviso in the amendment of § 1044 does not
include within its terms frauds existing under the Revenue Act, then necessarily such proviso does not include
conspiracies to commit frauds on the Government under
the Revenue Act.
Statutes of limitations are to be liberally construed in
favor of the accused. Lamkin v. People, 94 III. 501;
State v. Asbury, 26 Tex. 82; Commonwealth v. Haas,
75 Pa. St. 443; People v. Lord, 12 Hun. 282; Wharton,
Criminal Pleading & Practice, 9th ed., § 316, p. 215.
Conspiracies to defraud the Government under the
Revenue Act are offenses under § 37 of the Criminal Code
and, as such, are punishable within three years of commission, as any other conspiracies are punishable within
such period if not included within the proviso of the
amendment of § 1044, passed November 17, 1921. Such
being our contention, it is apparent that the decision of
this Court in United States v. Noveck has absolutely no
bearing upon the issue here presented.
MR. JUsTICWE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
October 3, 1924, defendants in error were indicted
under § 37 of the Criminal Code (35 Stat. 1088, 1096) for
conspiracy to defraud the United States in respect of its
internal revenue. It is charged that they conspired to
make a false income and profits tax return for 1920 for
the Freeman Coal Mining Company, and that they caused

a false return to be prepared, sworn to and filed, and
committed various other overt acts. But no act is alleged
to have been done later than March 14, 1921, more than
three years prior to the indictment. Each of the defendants interposed a plea that the prosecution was barred
because not commenced within three years after the
offense. The district court, being of opinion that the
applicable period of limitation had expired, entered judgment sustaining the pleas and discharging the defendants.
The case is here under the Criminal Appeals Act, c. 2564,
34 Stat. 1246. United States v. Barber, 219 U. S. 72.
The question for decision is whether the applicable
period is three years fixed by § 1044, Revised Statutes,
or six years specified in a proviso added by the Act of
November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220.
It is necessary to consider a number of statutory provisions. Section 1044 provides: "No person shall be
prosecuted . . . for any offense, not capital, except as
provided in section 1046, unless the indictment is found or
the information is instituted within three years next after
such offense shall have been committed . . ." The defendants insist that the foregoing provision applies. The
government contends that the case is covered by the
proviso: "Provided, however, That in offenses involving
the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States
or any agency thereof, whether by conspiracy or not, and
in any manner, and now indictable under any existing
statutes, the period of limitation shall be six years." And
the proviso was made applicable to offenses theretofore
committed and not already barred. Section 1046 provides: "No person shall be prosecuted . . . for any crime
arising under the revenue laws, or the slave-trade laws of
the United States, unless the indictment is found or the
information is instituted within five years next after the
committing of such crime."
The Act of July 5, 1884, c. 225, 23 Stat. 122, provides:
"That no person shall be prosecuted . . . for any of the

various offenses arising under the internal revenue laws
of the United States unless the indictment is found or the
information instituted within three years next after the
commission of the offense, in all cases where the penalty
prescribed may be imprisonment in the penitentiary, and
within two years in all other cases .
This Act was amended by § 1321 of the Revenue Act of
1921, approved November 23, 1921, c. 136, 42 Stat. 315,
which eliminated the two-year period so as to make the
three-year period apply to all offenses. And it was further
amended by § 1010 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1924,
approved June 4, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 341, which added
the same proviso that was added to § 1044. This latest
amendment, passed after the offense here charged, applied
the six-year period to offenses thereafter committed
against the internal revenue laws and covered by the
proviso.
The offense charged is a conspiracy and not one arising
under the internal revenue laws; and it is not within the
Act of July 5, 1884, as amended. The period applicable
is either three years under § 1044 or six years under the
proviso. The government argues that defrauding the
United States is an ingredient of the crime charged, and
that the six-year period applies. It relies on United
States v. Noveck, 271 U. S.201. But that case is not like
this one. The question there involved was whether an
allegation in an indictment for perjury (§ 125, Criminal
Code), that the crime was committed for the "purpose of
defrauding the United States," took the case out of the
general clause of § 1044. We held that the purpose stated
was not an element of perjury as defined by statute, and
that the extraneous fact alleged did not bring the case
within the proviso. When the opinion is read in the light
of the issue presented and decided, it furnishes no support
for the government's contention here.
The proper application of the proviso is to be found
upon a consideration of its scope as compared with that

UNITED STATES v. McELVAIN.

Opinion of the Court.

of the original section having regard to the other statutes
of limitation. Section 1044 is comprehensive in language
and purpose; it relates to all crimes, excepting only capital
offenses and those arising under the revenue laws and
slave trade laws. The purpose of the added proviso was
to carve out a special class of cases. It is to be construed
strictly, and held to apply only to cases shown to be clearly
within its purpose. United States v. Dickson, 15 Pet. 141,
165; Ryan v. Carter,93 U. S. 78, 83.
The proviso relates to substantive offenses involving
defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States,
whether committed by one or more or by conspiracy or
otherwise. It does not extend to any offenses not covered
by § 1044. The crhne of conspiracy to commit an offense
is distinct from the offense itself. The language of the
proviso cannot reasonably be read to include all conspiracies as defined by § 37. But if the proviso could be
construed to include any conspiracies, obviously it would
be limited to those to commit the substantive offenses
which it covers. All the various offenses under the internal revenue laws are excepted from § 1044. The proviso relates to the preceding part of the section and can
have no broader scope. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat.
1, 30. And legislation contemporaneous with and subsequent to its passage shows that Congress intended that
the proviso should not include such offenses. The proviso
and § 1321 were considered by Congress at the same time.
The latter was enacted six days after the proviso; it relates exclusively to offenses under the internal revenue
laws. That section is to be applied rather than the
general language of the proviso added to a statute that
never covered such offenses. And § 1010 (a) which prescribes for them the same limitations as are fixed by the
proviso, was unnecessary if the proviso already applied.
The three-year period fixed by § 1044 is applicable, and
defendants' pleas were rightly sustained.
Judgment affirmed.
