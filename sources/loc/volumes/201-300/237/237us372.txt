negligence, as distinguished from that of assumption of
risk. As this court has said,-' The defense of contributory
negligence was not dealt with by the statute.' Schle,,imer
v. Buffalo, Rochester & PittsburgRwy. Co., 220 U. S. 590,
595. Whether the rule of the Company applied in such
an emergency as that in which the decedent found himself,-whether he was guilty of contributory negligence
as matter of law, or could be excused upon the ground that
in an exceptional situation he acted with reasonable care,
were questions which the Federal act left untouched.
The action fell within the familiar category of cases involving the duty of a master to his servant. This duty is
defined by the common law, except as it may be modified
by legislation. The Federal statute, in the present case,
touched the duty of the master at a single point and, save
as provided in the statute, the right of the plaintiff to recover was left to be determined by .the law of the State.
It cannot be said, from any point of view, that any right
or immunity granted by the Act was denied to the plaintiff
in error.
Judgment affirmed.

McDOUGAL v. McKAY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.
No. 676.

Argued April 14, 1915.-Decided April 26, 1915.

In construing an Act of Congress, its known purpose must be effectuated as nearly as may be.
This court will not disregard the effect of decisions of the state and
Federal courts in regard to descent of Indian allotments which
have become rules of property and on which many titles have been
acquired.
Under the Supplemental Creek agreement of June 20, 1902, the descent

and distribution of allotments is in accordance with chapter 49,
Mansfield's Digest of the Laws of Arkansas, provided, however, that
only Creek citizens and their descendants shall inherit lands of the
Creek nation unless there are no Creek citizen heirs.
The provisions in Mansfield's Digest, distinguishing between ancestral estates which came to a decedent by a parent and new acquisitions and prescribing different rules of inheritance, apply to allotments of a Creek infant born in May, 1901, and dying in November
190j, and whose name was placed on the tribal rolls in October, 1902
pursuant to the provision in the Supplemental Creek agreement of
1902.
An allotment made under the Supplemental Creek agreement of 1902
.nust be treated, not as a new acquisition, but as an ancestral estate
within the meaning of chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest.
Where a Creek infant, whose allotment was made under the supplemental agreement of 1902,died leaving a father of Creek blood and
a h other not of Creek blood the father takes a fee simple to such
allotment; had both parents been of Creek blood and duly enrolled
each would have taken one-half.
43 Oklahoma, , affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the construction and effect of
the Supplemental Creek Agreement of June 30, 1902, and
the ascertainment of heirs of an infant of the Creek Nation
enrolled after death, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. George S. Ramsey, with whom.Mr. Edgar A. de
Meules was on the brief, for defendant in error:
The land in question was allotted to the heirs of Andrew
J. Berryhill, and while the heirs, take by purchase technically, yet the Arkansas law of descent should be applied
just the same as if the heirs of Andrew J. Berryhill had
actually inherited the allotment.
There should be no difference in the application of the
Arkansas law, of descent to a case where the heirs take by
purchase technically, instead of by actual descent.
The heirs take per stirpes and,not as a class per capitadiscussed with cases and authorities cited.
The allotment of a Creek citizen is not a new acquisition
under the Arkansas law, but in the nature of an ancestral
estate, his allotment being his birthright, and his right

to the same being acquired by virtue of being a member of
the tribe.
Under the Arkansas law of descent it becomes necessary
to determine whether or not the estate is ancestral or a
new acquisition when there are no descendants-when the
allotment passes in the ascending line it is absolutely material to first determine whether the estate is ancestral or
new in order to discover the course of descent, that is,
whether to the maternal or paternal side, but this is immaterial so long as there are descendants.
To allot the lands of an Indian tribe among the citizens
thereof is not the grant or donation of a new title, but is
more in the nature of a partition of prior rights.
That an allotment is not a new acquisition and not
analogous to the acquisition of title to the public domain
of the United States, see opinion of the Eighth Circuit
Court of Appeals in Shulthis v. McDougal.
As said by this court in Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515,
"To contend that the word 'allotted' in reference to the
land guaranteed to the Indians in certain treaties, indicates
a favor conferred rather than a right acknowledged
would . . . do injustice to the understanding of the
parties."
Indian allottees are not donees of the Government.

237 U. S.

Argument for amici curim.

Had Andrew J. Berryhill lived to receive an allotment
he would have taken the same, not technically merely, but
substantially, by purchase from the United States and the
Creek Nation, and not by descent from his tribal parent.
Under those circumstances, he would have taken the
allotment as a new acquisition, by purchase from the
United States and from the Creek Nation, even if it be
assumed for the purpose of the argument that he took
an equitable estate therein by descent from his tribal
parent, because the source of the legal title is'the controlling factor in determining whether an estate be a new acquisition or an ancestral estate.
Andrew J. Berryhill having died prior to the enactment
of the legislation authorizing the making of an allotment
to his heirs, and no estate, therefore, having vested in him,
said allotment was not an acquisition, new or otherwise, in
Andrew J. Berryhill; hence the allotment did not descend
to his heirs either as an ancestral estate or as a new acquisition, under § 2531, Mansfield's Digest, but vested in
his heirs, under § 2522, Mansfield's Digest, by direct grant
from the United States and the Creek Nation, becoming a
new acquisition in said heirs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

Opinion of the Court.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS

237 U.S.

delivered the opinion of

the court.
The solution of this controversy requires ascertainment
of the heirs of an infant who was enrolled after death,
within the intendment of the Supplemental Creek Agreement-Act of June 30, 1902 (c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500).
Andrew J. Berryhill, born in May, 1901, died during the
following November leaving his father-George Franklin
Berryhill-an enrolled Creek Indian, his mother, a noncitizen of that Nation, and seven paternal uncles and
aunts. His name was duly placed on the tribal rolls in
October, 1902, and during the years 1904 and 1905 the
land presently in controversy (with others) was allotted
and patented to his heirs. The father claiming to be
Andrew's sole heir-the mother joining-conveyed it
June 5, 1906, to defendants in error, Edmond and Perry
McKay. Afterwards the paternal uncles and aunts undertook to convey the fee subject to a life estate in the father
to McDougal, plaintiff in error. The McKays and parties
claiming under them being in possession of the property
and extracting oil and gas therefrom, McDougal instituted
this proceeding to restrain them and to have his remainder
interest declared and confirmed.
The Supreme Court of Oklahoma (43 Oklahoma, 261)
held the land must be treated as an ancestral estate in
Andrew J. Berryhill and declared the father sole heir.
Plaintiff in error maintains that it passed as a new acquisition and the father took a life estate with remainder over
to the uncles and aunts. Counsel appearing as amici
curie insist Andrew J. Berryhill had no estate therein, and
that the word heirs designates persons who themselves
took as purchasers.
Under treaty stipulations with the United States the
Creek Tribe of Indians as a community for a long time
owned and occupied large areas now withinthe borders of

Oklahoma and maintained there an organized government. Congress finally assumed complete control over
them and undertook to terminate their government and
distribute the tribal lands among the individuals. Washington v. Miller, 235 U. S. 422.
The act of March 1, 1901,-Original Creek Agreement
(c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, 870)-effective May 25, 1901 (32
Stat. 1971), provided for the enrollment of members living
on April 1, 1899, and their children born up to July 1,
1900, and also for allotment of tribal lands. It prescribed
further (§ 28) that "if any such child die after said date,
the lands and moneys to which it would be entitled, if
living, shall descend to its heirs according to the laws of
descent and distribution of the Creek Nation, and be
allotted and distributed to them accordingly."
The Supplemental Creek Agreement-Act of June 30,
1902, c. 323, 32 Stat. 500, 501, effective August 8, 1902
(32 Stat. 2021), repealed that portion of the Original one
establishing descent and distribution under the Creek Law
and directed that thereafter these "shall be in accordance
with chapter 49 of Mansfield's Digest of the Statutes of
Arkansas now in force in Indian Territory: Provided, That
only citizens of the Creek Nation, male and female, and
their Creek descendants shall inherit lands of the Creek
Nation: And provided further, That if there be no person
of Creek citizenship to take the descent and distribution of
said estate, then the inheritance shall go to noncitizen
heirs in the order named in said chapter 49." It also extended the right of enrollment to children born after
July 1, 1900, and up to May 25, 1901, and declared "if
any such child has died since May 25, 1901, or may hereafter die before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of the funds of the tribe, the lands and
moneys to which he would be entitled if living shall descend to his heirs as herein provided and be allotted and
distributed to them accordingly."

The pertinent sections of Mansfield's Digest are copied
in the margin.' They sharply distinguish between an es1Section 2522. When any person shall die, having title to any real
estate of inheritance, or personal estate, not disposed of, nor otherwise
limited by marriage settlement, and shall be intestate as to such estate,
it shall descend and be distributed, in parcenary, to his kindred, male
and female, subject to the payment of his debts and the widow's dower,
in the following manner:
First. To children, or their descendants, in equal parts.
Second. If there be no children, then to the father, then to the
mother; if no mother, then to the brothers and sisters, or their descendants, in equal parts.
Third. If there be no children, nor their descendants, father, mother,
brothers or sisters, nor their descendants, then to the grandfather,
grandmother, uncles and aunts and their descendants, in equal parts,
and so on in other cases, without end, passing to the nearest lineal ancestor, and their children and their descendants, in equal parts.
Section 2581. In cases where the intestate shall die without descendants, if the estate come by the father, then it shall ascend to the
father and his heirs; if by the mother, the estate, or so much thereof as
came by the mother, shall ascend to the mother and her heirs; but if
the estate be a new acquisition it shall ascend to the father for his lifetime, and then descend, in remainder, to the collateral kindred of the
intestate in the manner provided in this act; and, in default of a father,
then to the mother, for her life-time; then to descend to the collateral
heirs as before provided.
\Section 2582. The estate of an intestate, in default of a father and
mother, shall go, first, to the brothers and sisters, and their descendants, of the father; next, to the brothers and sisters, and their descendants, of the mother. This provision applies only where there are no
kindred, either lineal or collateral, who stand in a nearer relation.
Section 2588. Relations of the half-blood shall inherit equally with
those of the whole blood in the same degree; and the descendants of
such relatives shall inherit in the same manner as the descendants of the
whole blood, unless the inheritance come to the intestate by descent,
devise, or gift, of some one of his ancestors, in which case all those'
who are not of the blood of such ancestor shall be excluded from such
inheritance.

tate which came to a decedent by a parent and a new acquisition and prescribe different rules of inheritance.
In Shufthis v. McDougal (170 Fed. Rep. 529), decided
June 3, 1909, by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit; title to another portion of the Andrew J.
Berryhill allotment was involved and it became necessary
to ascertain his heirs. Having carefully considered the
whole subject that court summed up its conclusions thus
(pp. 534-535):
"So long as the tribal relations continued, a member
had no right to have a share of the tribal property set off
to him as his private, separate estate, for the constitutional
policy of the tribe was ownership in common. But when,
as here, the time came to disband the tribe, its ownership
as a political society could no longer continue, and the
division of its property was far more nearly akin to the
partition of property among tenants in common than the
grant of an estate by a sovereign owner. Under such a
scheme it cannot be said that the property which passed
to an allottee is a new right or acquisition created by the
allotment. The right to the property antedates the allotment, and is simply given effect to by that act. Viewing the tribal property and its division in this light, Andrew J. Berryhill acquired his right to the land in question
by his membership in the tribe. It was his birthright. It
came to him by the blood of his tribal parent, and not by
purchase. In applying the Arkansas statute, we shall
accomplish the purpose of Congress and the Creek Nation
best by treating the lands not as a new acquisition by him,
but as an inheritance from his parents as members of the
tribe. His father was the only parent through whom he.
shall have come to thc intestate on the part of the father," or "mother,"
as the case may be, shall be construed to include every case where the
inheritance shall have come to the intestate by gift, devise or descent
from the parent referred to, or from any relative of the blood of such
parent.

derived his right, and to the father the land should pass.
If the mother had been a member of the tribe, then the
land should properly pass to the parents equally. From
this premise it necessarily follows that George Franklin
Berryhill succeeded to the entire estate of the property
in question." An appeal to this court was dismissed
June 7, 1912, for lack of jurisdiction (225 U. S. 561).
The Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Lena Pigeon v.
William Buck, 38 Oklahoma, 101 (April 23, 1913), determined the heirs of a full-blooded Creek citizen who, having been duly enrolled, received a patent to her allotment
and then died intestate, without descendants, leaving
father, mother, brothers, sister and her husband. After
reference to the above-quoted portions of Mansfield's Digest it said (pp. 103-104): "That the land in question was
not a new acquisition, and pursuant to these sections, when
construed together, passed to John Pigeon and Mate
Pigeon, the father and mother of the deceased, is no longer
an open question in this jurisdiction, having in effect been
decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit in $hulthis v. McDougal, 170 Fed. Rep. 529. .
Many titles to lands on the eastern side of this State have
been acquired on the strength of this decision, and to
such an extent that the same has become a rule of property
there (De Walt v. Cline, 35 Oklahoma, 197; S.C., 128 Pac.
Rep. 121; MaHarryv. Eatman, 29 Oklahoma, 46; S.C., 116
Pac. Rep. 935; Duff v. Keaton, 33 Oklahoma, 92; S.C., 124
Pac. Rep. 291), we hold that John Pigeon and Mate Pigeon,
his wife, are the persons to whom, on the death of the
allottee, this estate passed in equal moieties, and that
plaintiffs in error, plaintiffs below, have no interest
therein."
We recognize the unusual difficulties surrounding the
problem presented upon the record, and appreciate the
very forceful arguments offered in support of the conflicting theories. The circumstances are novel, and the canons

of descent contained in Mansfield's Digest are not precisely applicable thereto; but these rules must be accommodated to the facts and the great purpose of Congress
effectuated as nearly as may be. And not only would it
be improper for us to disregard the effect of the decisions
already announced by the Circuit Court of Appeals and
the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, which are supported by
cogent reasoning, but considering the peculiar and rapidly
changing conditions within that Stateespecial consideration must be accorded to them. We accordingly accept
the doctrine announced therein and hold: (1) The property must be treated as an ancestral estate which passed
in accordance with the applicable provisions of chapter 49,
Mansfield's Digest. (2) As the father, George Franklin
Berryhill, was of Creek blood, and the mother not, he
took a fee simple title to all the land in question. If both
parents had been of Creek blood and duly enrolled each
would have taken one-half.
Sizemore v. Brady, 235 U. S. 441, has been referred to
as in conflict with the doctrine herein approved. In that
case lands were allotted and patented after August 8,
1902, to the heirs of Grayson, an enrolled Creek, who died
March 1, 1901, and a contest arose between a paternal
cousin and cousins on the maternal side. The formerBrady-claimed descent should be determined according
to Mansfield's Digest and that he was sole heir. The latter-Sizemore and Newberry-maintained the Creek Law
applied and that they were the only heirs. The Supreme
Court of Oklahoma decided in favor of Brady (33 Oklahoma, 169) and in this court the plaintiffs in error expressly
admitted that he should prevail" in event the court should
hold said lands passed under Chapter 49 of Mansfield's
Digest of the Laws of Arkansas, in accordance with the
Act of Congress known as the Creek's Supplemental
Agreement." We concluded the Arkansas statute controlled and of course did not undertake to decide the

Submitted March 15, 1915.-Decided April 26, 1915.

McDougal v. McKay, ante, p. 372, followed to the effect that an
allotment made to a full blooded Creek Indian is, for purposes of
descent and distribution, to be considered, not as a new acquisition,
but as an ancestral estate and passes as such under chapter 49 of
Mansfield's Digest of the Laws of Arkansas.
The same ruling also applies to an allotment of a full blooded Chickasaw Indian.
38 Oklahoma, 37 and 101, affirmed.
