Railroad yards belonging to the same railroad but several miles apart,
such as those of the Erie Railroad at Jersey City, Weehawken and
Bergen, although important accessories pf the same terminal are
not actually one yard, and trains moving between them are not

engaged merely in switching operations, but are engaged in transportation within the purview of the air-brake provisions of the

This was a civil action by the United States to recover
from the Erie Railroad Company a penalty for each of

several alleged violations of the Safety Appliance Act of
March 2, 1893, c. 196, 27 Stat. 531, as amended and supplemented by the acts of April 1, 1896, c. 87, 29 Stat. 85;
March 2, 1903, c. 976, 32 Stat. 943; and April 14, 1910,
c. 160, 36 Stat. 298.
The declaration contained twenty-six counts. The
first seven were based upon the use of that number of
cars having defective couplers, the eighth upon the use
of a car without grab irons or handholds at one end, and
the remaining eighteen upon the operation of that number of transfer trains in which less than eighty-five per
cent. of the cars were controlled by air brakes. All of
these acts were charged as having occurred in January
and February, 1911, on the defendant's railroad while it
was being used and operated in moving interstate traffic.
The plea interposed was the general issue.
The case was tried twice. The first trial resulted in a
judgment for the Government which was reversed by
the Circuit Court of Appeals. 197 Fed. Rep. 287. At
the second trial there was a directed verdict for the defendant and the judgment thereon was affirmed by that
court. 212 Fed. Rep. 853. This writ of error challenges
the judgment of affirmance.
There was no real conflict in the evidence, the material
facts being as follows: The defendant operates an interstate railroad extending from New York City via New
Jersey to Buffalo and Chicago. In that connection it
maintains railroad yards, with docks for ferries and floats,
on the west bank of the Hudson River, at Jersey City
and Weehawken, where cars are received from and forwarded to various points around New York Harbor; and
it maintains another yard at Bergen-inland two miles
from Jersey City and three and one-half miles from
Weehawken-where cars are received from and forwarded
to western points. In the Jersey City yard there are 60
tracks, in the Weehawken yard 80 and in the Bergen

yard 115. Between the Bergen yard and the others is a
hill about 250 feet high, which is pierced by a tunnel almost a mile in length. The three yards are connected by
double tracks extending from Jersey City and Weehawken
to the eastern portal of the tunnel and then passing
through the tunnel to Bergen. The situation may be
illustrated by treating the three yards as located at the
outer points of the letter Y-Weehawken and Jersey
City at the upper points and Bergen at the base-and
connected by tracks conforming to the lines of that letter,
the tunnel being along part of the lower line. The connecting tracks are not used by passenger trains but are
the main tracks over which freight is moved from and to
points around New York Harbor. Jersey City, Weehawken and Bergen are all stations at which freight, both
local and interstate, is accepted and delivered, and are
so shown in the defendant's tariff schedules. While the
yards at these places are all used for receiving, storing,
handling and forwarding cars, the work of classifying,
distributing and assembling the cars preparatory to sending them to their ultimate destinations, west and east,
is principally done in the Bergen yard. Most of the
regular west-bound freight trains are made up and started
in that yard and most of the regular east-bound freight
trains are stopped and broken up there. Some regular
trains carrying high-class freight pass Bergen without
more than a temporary stop, but the greater part of the
traffic is moved between the yards at Jersey City and
Weehawken and the one at Bergen in transfer trains
which only run between those yards and are operated over
the double tracks before described. These transfer trains
usually have about twenty-five cars, do not carry a
caboose, are drawn and operated by engines and crews
specially engaged in that service, and have flags and
signal lights differing somewhat from those on other
trains but answering the same purpose. They are not

Opinion of the Court.

run according to fixed schedules but at irregular intervals
under the orders of yard masters and according to block
signals. Their speed is from seven to eighteen miles an
hour and they move great numbers of cars in each direction every day. All go through the tunnel, which is admitted to be very dark, and upon each trip they pass over
several switches leading to other tracks, traverse part of
the same line over which fifteen regular through and local
freight trains are moved each day, and cross at grade
tracks which are in daily use by approximately thirtyfive passenger trains.
The cars named in the first eight counts of the declaration were defective in the particulars charged and while
thus defective were hauled-six from Jersey City to
Bergen and two from Weehawken to Bergen-in transfer
trains along with other cars in commercial use. All of
the defects were discovered in the yards from which the
cars were moved and those in six of the cars could have
been readily repaired in those yards by the local force of
car repairers, coisisting of seven men at Jersey City and
five at Weehawken. The defects in two of the cars were
serious and as to them Bergen may have been the nearest
available point for making the necessary repairs. These
cars were hauled by means of chains instead of draw-bars
and there was no claim that they contained live stock or
perishable freight.
The transfer trains named in the remaining eighteen
counts were hauled-nine from Jersey City to Bergen,
two from Weehawken to Bergen,. one from Bergen to
Jersey City and six from Bergen to Weehawken-without
the requisite number of air brakes being in use or connected for uise. On fourteen of these trains there was no
attempt to connect any of the air brakes and on the remaiiing four less than 55 per cent. were connected.
Brakemen were required to be on the cars and in some
instances rode on the tops of box cars pursuant to a rule

of the defendant. No cars were switched out of or into
these trains while they were on the way from one yard to
the other.
The Circuit Court of Appeals rested its judgment upon
the conclusions (a) that the three yards are not separate
or distinct, but with the connecting tracks constitute a
single and extensive yard, (b) that the movements of the
transfer trains from Jersey City and Weehawken to
Bergen and vice versa were mere switching operations and
therefore not within the air-brake provision in the statute, and (c) that it was permissible under the statute to
haul the cars with defective equipment in the circumstances disclosed.
We cannot assent to the view that the yards at Jersey
City, Weehawken and Bergen are but a single yard.
They doubtless are important accessories to the defendant's eastern terminal, but that does not make them one
yard. They lie from two to three and one-half miles
apart, are not so linked together that cars may be moved
from one to another with the freedom which is usual and
essential in intra-yard movements) and are in actual practice treated as separate yards.
The original Safety Appliance Act is entitled "An Act
to promote the safety of employds and travelers upon
railroads by compelling common carriers engaged in
interstate commerce to equip their cars with automatic
couplers and continuous brakes and their locomotives
with driving-wheel brakes, and for other purposes.
The first section makes it unlawful, among other things,
for a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce
"to run any train" in such commerce without l aving a
sufficient number of the cars so equipped with train
brakes-commonly spoken of as air brakes-that the
engineer on the locomotive can control the speed of the
train "without requiring brakemen to use the common
hand brake for that purpose." The second section pro-

UNITED STATES v. ERIE R. R.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

hibits such a carrier from hauling or using on its line in
moving interstate traffic any car not equipped with couplers which can be coupled and uncoupled automatically
"without the necessity of men going between the ends of
the cars;" and the fourth section forbids the use in interstate commerce of any car not provided with secure grab
irons or handholds in the ends and sides of the car "for
greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars."
The sixth section imposes for every violation of the act a
penalty of $100, to be recovered by suit. The act of 1903,
by its first section, provides that the requirements of the
original act respecting train brakes, automatic couplers
and grab irons shall be held to apply to "all trains" and
cars "used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce," unless falling within a minor exception without
bearing here. By its second section this act requires that
not less than 50 per cent. of the cars in a train shall have
their train brakes used and operated by the engineer on the
locomotive, confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission authority to increase this minimum percentage
to the end that the objects intended may be more fully
accomplished, and makes" the penal provision before
named applicable to violations of the requirement as
enlarged by the Commission. By an order promulgated
June 6, 1910, and becoming effective September 1, following, the Commission increased the minimum number
of cars whose train brakes must be under the engineer's
control to 85 per cent.
It will be perceived that the air-brake provision deals
with running a train, while the other r-quirements relate
to hauling or using a car. In one a train is the unit and
in the other a car. As the context shows, a train in the
sense intended consists of an engine and cars which have
been assembled and coupled together for a run or trip
along the road. When a train is thus made up and is
proceeding on its journey it is within the operation of the

237 U. S.

air-brake provision. But it is otherwise with the various
movements in railroad yards whereby cars are assembled
and coupled into outgoing trains and whereby incoming
trains which have completed their run are broken up.
These are not train movements but mere switching operations, and so are not within the air-brake provision. The
other provisions calling for automatic couplers and grab
irons are of broader application and embrace switching
operations as well as train movements, for both involve a
hauling or using of cars. Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.,
196 U. S. 1; Schlemmer v. Buffalo Ry., 205 U. S. 1; S. C.,
220 U. S. 590; St. Louis, I. Mtn. &c. Railway v. Taylor,
210 U. S. 281; Chi., B. & Q. Ry. v. United States, 220 U. S.
559; Delk v. St. Louis &c. R. R., Id., 580; Southern Railway v. United States, 222 U. S. 20, 22; Chicago &c. Ry. v.
King, Id., 222; Southern Railway v. Crockett, 234 U. S. 725;
Minn. &. St. Paul Ry. v. Popplar, ante, p. 369.
We are persuaded that the transfer trains moving from
Jersey City and Weehawken to Bergen and vice versa came
within the purview of the air-brake provision. They
were made up in yards like other trains and then proceeded to their destinations over main-line tracks used
by other freight trains, both through and local. They
were not moving cars about in a yard or on tracks set
apart for switching operations, but were engaged in mainline transportation, and this in circumstances where
they had to pass through a dark tunnel, over switches
leading to other tracks and across passenger tracks
whereon trains were frequently moving. Thus it is plain
that, in common with other trains using the same mainline tracks, they were exposed to hazards which made it
essential that appliances be at hand for readily and quickly
checking or controlling their movements. The original
act prescribed that these appliances should consist of
air brakes controlled by the engineer on the locomotive,
and the act of 1903 declared that this requirement should

UNITED STATES v. ERIE R. R.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"be held to apply to all trains." We therefore conclude
and hold that it embraced these transfer trains. Its
applicability to this class of trains was considered and
sustained in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. United
States, 198 Fed. Rep. 637; United States v. Grand Trunk
Ry., 203 Fed. Rep. 775; United States v. Pere Marquette
Railroad, 211 Fed. Rep. 220; and La Mere v. Railway
Transfer Co., 125 Minnesota, 159.
The hauling of the cars with defective equipment was
clearly in contravention of the statute. While § 4 of the
act of 1910 permits such cars to be hauled, without liability
for the statutory penalty, from the place where the defects are discovered to the nearest available point for
making repairs, it distinctly excludes from this permission
all cars which can be repaired at the place where they are
found to be defective, and also declares that nothing
therein shall be construed to permit the hauling of defective cars "by means of chains instead of drawbars" in
association with other cars in commercial use, unless the
defective cars "contain livestock or 'perishable freight.'
Six of the cars that were hauled while their equipment
was defective could have been readily repaired at the
place where the defects were discovered, which was
before the hauling began. The remaining two were
hauled by means of chains instead of drawbars in association with other cars in commercial use, and it is not claimed
that they contained livestock or perishable freight.
It follows that the District Court erred in directing a
verdict for the defendant and the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in sustaining that ruling. The judgments of
both courts must therefore be reversed and the case
remanded to the District Court for a new trial.
It is so ordered.
