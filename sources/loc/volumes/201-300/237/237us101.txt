GUFFEY v. JAMES A. SMITH.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No..86. Argued December 2, 3, 1914.-Decided April 5, 1915.
Under the settled rule of decision in Illinois an oil and gas lease like that
involved in this suit passes to the lessee, his heirs and assigns, a
present vested freehold interest in the premises, and an option on
the part of the lessee to surrender does not create a tenancy at will,
give the lessor an option to compel surrender or make the lease void
as wanting in mutuality.
Decisions of the highest courts of the State in which the property
is situated are accepted and applied by tie Federal courts as rules
of property in passing upon the estate and rights passing by such
a lease.
Where, as is the case in Illinois, the holder of such a lease cannot
maintain ejectment in the state courts, he cannot, uider §§ 721 and
1914, maintain such an action in the Federal courts in that State.
Where ejectment cannot be maintained by one holding a gas and oil
lease against another claiming under a later lease, and no other
action affords an adequate remedy, the earlier lessee may maintain
a suit in equity to restrain the later lessee and for accounting and
discovery in the Federal courts where the requisite amount is involved and diverse citizenship exists, even though such a suit, by
reason of the lessee having an option to surrender, could not be
maintained in the courts pf the States.
Remedies afforded and modes of procedure pursued in the Federal
courts sitting as courts of equity are not determined by local laws
or rules of decision, but by general principles, rules and usages of
equity having uniform operation in those courts wherevet sitting.
According to the general principles and rules of equity enforced in the
Federal courts, a clause in a lease permitting the lessee to surrender
it is not an obstacle to enforcing the lease in equity against those who,
under a later lease, are committing waste.
Whether a lease is so unfbir and inequitable that it cannot be enforced
by the lessee in equity must be determined in view of the circumstances under which it was given; and in this case held that an oil
and gas lease of undeveloped land requiring all expenses to be paid
by the lessee and providing for reasonable royalties and fixed rental

during a designated period of delay is not so unfair and inequitable
as to require that equitable relief be withheld, even where it contains
a provision permitting the lessee to surrender it at any time.
Under the statutes of Illinois a lessee who omits to pay rent when
due may cure his default by payment at any time prior to demand
and notice or within the time named in the notice, and if so paid the
lessee's rights are the same as though the default had not occurred.
On an accounting for oil and gas taken under color of a lease later than
that of plaintiff but without actual knowledge thereof, although the
same was recorded, held, that the later lessees were entitled to be
credited with the cost of improvements and operation, incurred
prior to, but not after, the date on which they were actually notified
of the rights of the earlier lessee. The continued taking thereafter
was a wilful taking and appropriation of the property of another.

Mr. J. A. Hindman for respondents:
To warrant the granting of any of the relief sought,
the complainants must not only come into court with
"clean hands," but it must clearly appear that the contract upon which they base their demand for relief is
one which a court of equity will enforce. They must
recover, if at all, upon the strength of their own title
and upon the merits of their own cause; Michigan Pipe

substances,, the courts have placed contracts of this kind
in a class by themselves, and in the light of the known
character of the business of "oil mining," construe them
most strictly against the lessee and favorable to the lessor.

Law Relating to Oil and Gas, p. 98.
The contracts upon which the complainants base
these actions should not be enforced in a court of equity
because they are deceptive, unjust, unequal, unfair and
inequitable; while they purport to be for the sole and
only purpose of mining and operating for oil and gas,
they contain no provision requiring this purpose to be
accomplished, but permit the complainants to hold the
premises dormant for the purpose of speculation, and
thus defeat the very purpose for which they were given.

The leases owned by the complainants, and upon which
they base these actions, are not enforceable in a court of
equity (a) for want of consideration, (b) for want of
mutuality of engagement and (c) for want of mutuality
of remedy.
The consideration for the execution of the leases in
question was not the recited $1.00, nor the 25 cents a
year mentioned, but the real consideration was the development of the premises for, and if found, the production of oil and gas, and the rents and royalties resulting.

The completion of a well upon the demised premises
within the time stipulated (nine months) was a condition precedent to the vesting of any estate. And at the
expiration of the time given in which to make the preliminary test, none having been made, the lessor had a

Oil and gas in situ are not capable of private ownership,
but they become "property" only when reduced to possession. Title to these substances is inchoate and contingent upon their discovery and production. Leases
of this character, therefore, vest in the lessee no present
title to the oil and gas, but are a mere license to explore
for, and, if found, to reduce the same to possession. Cases

If the oil and gas in place, like solid minerals, were
capable of ownership, and if it were conceded that the
leases in question conveyed to the complainants title to
the oil an4 gas in situ, the measure of damages, in an action at law for their conversion, would be the value of
these substances in place, and not the amount for which
they were sold, unless the trespass was wilful or malicious.

delivered the opinion of

This was a suit in equity brought in the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Eastern District of Illinois

Opinion of the Court.

by the holders of an oil and gas lease covering a small tract
of land in Crawford County, Illinois, to enjoin operations
under a later and similar lease and to obtain a discovery.
and an accounting in respect of the oil and gas produced
and sold in, the course of operations already had. In due
course the case was referred to a master who took the
evidence, reported the same with his conclusions upon
questions of fact and law and recommended a decree
awarding the relief prayed, but taking no account of the
gas theretofore used or sold. Exceptions to the report
were filed by the defendants and at the final hearing the
Circuit Court overruled the exceptions, confirmed the
report and entered a decree as recommended. The decree
was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals with a direction that the bill be dismissed, the ground of decision
being that the complainants were not entitled to relief
in equity and should be remitted to such remedy as they
might have at law, because by the terms of their lease
they had an option to surrender it at any time. 202 Fed.
Rep. 106. Other questions in the suit were not considered
by that court. The case is now here upon a writ of certiorari.
Both leases were for the same tract and were given by
James A. Smith, who owned it in fee simple. The earlier
lease was given to one Walton May 22, 1905, and by two
successive assignments made in November and December following was transferred to Joseph F. Guffey and
others, the complainants. It and the assignments were
properly recorded June 15, 1906. The later lease was
given to one Allison August 9, 1906, was assigned shortly
thereafter to one Willett and was transferred March 25,
1907, to Solley, Johnson and Hennig, three of the defendants. There was also an intermediate lease to one
Wilcox, given March 23, 1906, but as it was voluntarily
surrendered and nothing is claimed thereunder, it suffices
to say (a) that it contained a provision whereby the lessee

110.

.

therein agreed to protect the lessor against any expense or
damage that might arise by reason of the earlier lease,
(b) that before surrendering it Wilcox drilled a well upon
the premises in an effort to find oil and gas, but without
success, and (c) that the complainants, upon learning of
this lease, promptly served upon Wilcox and the lessor a
notice asserting the rights conferred by the prior lease.
Allison and his immediate assignee, Willett, took the
subsequent lease with actual notice of the earlier one and
with constructive, if not actual, notice of its transfer to
the complainants, but made no inquiry of the latter respecting its status or their claim under it. Nothing was
done under the subsequent lease by Allison, but after
its assignment to Willett the latter entered upon the
premises, with the lessor's sanction, and drilled a well
which yielded a flow of gas but no oil. Upon learning of
these drilling operations the complainants, in a written
notice to Willett and the lessor, again asserted their claim
under the prior lease and demanded that the operations
cease.
Solley and his associates took the assignment from Willett without actual knowledge of the prior lease, but under
the local law were constructively charged with notice of it
and of its transfer to, the complainants, for both were duly
recorded. They acted upon the advice of an abstractor
who failed to make a proper examination of the records.
After receiving the assignment, Solley and his associates,
with the lessor's approval, proceeded to drill other wells
upon the premises and developed the presence therein of
oil in paying quantities. On August 1, 1907, they were
actually and fully informed of the prior lease and of the
complainants' purpose to insist upon the rights conferred
by it and to obtain redress for the invasion of those rights,
but they persisted in their drilling operations and produced and sold from the premises large quantities of oil.
These operations were being continued when the suit was

GUFFEY v. SMITH.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

brought (March 24, 1908) and when the accounting was
had before the master. Most of the oil taken from the
premises was extracted and sold after August 1, 1907, the
date when Solley and his associates were actually and fully
informed of the complainants' claim.
In its terms the prior lease of May 22, 1905, under which
the complainants claim, substantially conforms to one
in common use in unexplored territory, as is shown by
the evidence in this case and by reported decisions in
other cases. It recites that it was given in consideration
of one dollar paid to the lessor and the covenants and
agreements of the lessee therein set forth. It contains
the usual words of grant and demise; runs to the lessee,
Walton, his heirs and assigns; describes the purpose for
which it was given as that of mining and operating for
oil and gas and laying pipe lines and building tanks and
other structures to take care of those substances when
produced, and defines the terms for which it was to endure as five years from its date "and as long thereafter as
oil or gas or either of them is produced" from the premises.
The lessee covenants and agrees therein, first, to deliver
to the lessor, free of cost, in the pipe line to which the wells
may be connected the equal one-eighth part of all oil
produced and saved from the premises; second, to pay
one hundred dollars per year for the gas from each gas
well the product of which is marketed and used off the
premises; third, to locate all wells so as to interfere as
little as possible with the cultivated portions of the land;
and fourth, to complete a well on the premises within
nine months after the date of the lease, or to pay at the
rate of twenty-five cents per acre per year, quarterly
in advance, for the additional time the completion of a
well is delayed beyond the nine months, such payments
to be made directly to the lessor or deposited to his credit
in the Exchange Bank, at Martinsville, Illinois. There
is also a surrender clause to the effect that "upon the

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.

237 U. S.

payment of one dollar, at any time," the lessee, his heirs
or assigns, "shall have the right to surrender this lease
for, cancellation, after which all payments and liabilities
thereafter to accrue" thereunder "shall cease and determine."
AAong the master's findings and conclusions which
were approved by the Circuit Court were the following:
"The Master further finds that the complainants have
been at all times financially responsible and able to perform the covenants of their lease; that they have not
drilled a well on said premises, but that they have paid
all the rentals required by the terms of said lease to be
pald, at the rate of twenty-five cents-per acre, and deposited the same in the bank designated in the lease to
receive the same, for the owner of the land."
"That prior to purchasing the Allison lease, Willett
made inquiry by telephone of the Exchange Bank, at
Martinsville, whether or not rentals had been paid on
the Walton lease by the complainants, and was informed
by the bank that no such payments had been made or
deposited to the credit of James A. Smith, although,
as a matter Qf fact, the Master further finds that, at the
time the said Bank gave this information, the rental
money had in fact been deposited to the credit of the said
James A. Smith."
"That the Walton lease, under which complainants
claim- title, has never been forfeited for failure to comply
with the terms thereof, and up to the time of the filing
of this suit, no grounds existed whereby such a forfeiture
could be declared."
In addition to Solley and his associates, the defendants
to the suit included the lessor and the Ohio Oil Company,
the latter having purchased the oil with knowledge of
the premises from which it was produced and of the
complainants' claim under the prior lease.
It is settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of

GUFFEY v. SMITH.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

Illinois that an oil and gas lease like that of the complainants passes to the lessee, his heirs and assigns, a
present vested right-"a freehold interest "-in the
premises, that this interest is taxable as real property,
and that the clause giving the lessee an option to surrender the lease at any time is valid, does not create a
tenancy at will or give the lessor an option to compel
a surrender, and does not make the lease void as wanting
in mutuality. Bruner v. Hicks, 230 Illinois, 536,,540, 542;

Oil Co., 263 Illinois, 518, 524. These decisions constitute
rules of property and must be accepted and applied in
passing upon the complainants' rights. McGoon v. Scales,

It also is settled that in the courts of Illinois the holder
of such a lease cannot maintain an action of ejectment
thereon (Watford Oil and Gas Co. v. Shipman, supra,
p. 12; Gillespie v. Fulton Oil and Gas Co., 236 Illinois,
188, 206), and by reason of the legislation of Congress
requiring that in actions at law in the Federal courts of
first instance effect shall be given to the local laws and
modes of proceeding (Rev. Stat., §§ 721, 914) it results that
the compiainants could not have maintained an action
of ejectment in the Circuit Court. An action for damages,
of course, would not have afforded a plain, adequate and
complete remedy in the circumstances and,. if such a remedy was to be had, it was necessary to resort to a suit
in equity for an injunction, discovery and accounting,
as was done. Joy v. St. Louis, 138 U. S. 1, 46; Coosaw
Mining Co. v. South Carolina, 144 U. S. 550, 567; Franklin Telegraph Co. v. Harrison, 145 U. S. 459, 474. Thus
the principal question for decision is whether such a suit
could be successfully maintained in the Circuit Court,

diverse citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount
being conceded.
The Supreme Court of Illinois, while fully sustaining
the right to maintain such a suit in the courts of the
State when the lease contains no clause giving the lessee
an option to surrender it (Gillespie v. Fulton Oil and Gas
Co., supra), holds that the presence of such a clause in
the lease operates to prevent the lessee from directly
or indirectly enforcing it in equity (Watford Oil and Gas
Co. v. Shipman and Ulrey v. Keith, supra), the ground
of distinction being that the surrender clause, although
lawful in itself and not affecting the validity of the lease,
renders it so lacking in mutuality that equity will remit
the lessee to his remedy at law. These decisions, it is
insisted, should have been accepted and applied by the
Circuit Court. To this we cannot assent. By the legislation of Congress and repeated decisions of this court it
has long been settled that the remedies afforded and
modes of proceeding pursued in the Federal courts, sitting
as courts of equity, are not determined by local laws or
rules of decision, but by general principles, rules and
usages of equity having uniform operation in those courts
wherever sitting. Rev. Stat., §§ 913, 917; Neves v. Scott,
13 How. 268, 272; Payne v. Hook, 7 Wall. 425, 430; Dodge
v. Tulleys, 144 U. S. 451, 457; Mississippi Mills v. Cohn,
150 U. S. 202, 204. As was said in the first of these cases,
"Wherever a case in equity may arise and be determined,
under the judicial power of the United States, the same
principles of equity must be applied to it, and it is for the
courts of the United States, and for this court in the last
resort, to decide what those principles are, and to apply
such of them, to each particular case, as they may find
justly applicable."
It next is insisted that according to the general principles and rules of equity administered in the Federal courts
the surrender clause constitutes an insuperable obstacle

Opinion of the Court.

to granting the relief sought, the argument being that,
as the complainants have a reserved option to surrender
the lease at any time, it cannot be specifically enforced
against them and therefore cannot be similarly enforced
in their favor. The rule intended to be invoked has to do
with the specific performance of executory contracts, is
restrained by many exceptions, and has been the subject
of divergent opinions, on the part of jurists and textwriters. Without considering it in other aspects, we think
it is without present application. Rightly understood,
this is not a suit for specific performance. Its purpose
is not to enforce an executory contract to give a lease,
or even to enforce an executory promise in a lease already
given, but to protect a present vested leasehold, amounting to a freehold interest, from continuing an irreparable
injury calculated to accomplish its practical destruction.
The complaint is not that performance of some promised
act is being withheld or refused, but that complainants'
vested freehold right is being wrongfully violated and
impaired in a way which calls for preventive relief. In
this respect the case is not materially different from what
it would be if the complainants were claiming under an
absolute conveyance rather than a lease. In a practical
sense the suit is one to prevent waste, and it comes with
ill grace for the defendants to say that they ought not to
be restrained because perchance the complainants may
sometime exercise their option to surrender the lease.
We think this option, which has not been exercised and
may never be, is not an obstacle to the relief sought.
Another contention of the defendants is that the lease
is so unfair and inequitable in its terms that relief in
equity should be withheld and the complainants left to
seek a remedy at law, which is tantamount to saying
that they must submit to the practical destruction of
their leasehold and accept such reparation as may be
obtained thr'ough recurring actions for damages. Whether

the lease is unfair and inequitable must be determined
in view of the circumstances in which it was given. Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557, 570, 571; Marble Company v.
Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, 357; Franklin Telegraph Co. v.
Harrison, 145 U. S. 459, 473. They were these: Whether
the leased tract contained oil or gas was not known. It
was in an undeveloped district in which there was no oil
or ga's well and no pipe line leading to a market. Drilling
wells was attended with large expense, the cost of each
well being upwards of one thousand dollars, according
to the testimony of one of the defendants. No fraud,
deception or overreaching was practiced in procuring
the lease. The parties were competent to contract with
each other and entered into the lease because in the circumstances its provisions were satisfactory to them.
Under its terms the cost of the drilling was to be borne
by the lessee. If the undertaking was unsuccessful he
alone was to stand the loss, and if it was successful the
lessor was to share in the results by receiving substantial
royalties, the reasonableness of which is not questioned.
The consideration for the lease, viz., one dollar paid to
the lessor and the covenants and agreements of the lessee,
cannot be pronounced unreasonable. Similar leases resting upon a like consideration often have been sustained
in cases not distinguishable from this.' The lease was
to remain in force five years and as much longer as oil
or gas was being produced from the premises; in other
words it was to expire in five years unless oil or gas was
produced within that time. The lessee expressly covenanted to drill a well within nine months or to pay a

rental of twenty-five cents per acre per year quarterly,
in advance, for such time as the -completion of the well
was delayed beyond that period, the delay, of course,
not to extend beyond the primary term of five years.
The terms of the covenant doubtless were suggested by
the undeveloped condition of the district and by the expense and risk incident to exploring for oil and gas. They
evidently were satisfactory to the lessor at the time and
the record. discloses no reason for holding that in the circumstances they wer6 unreasonably liberal to the lessee.
Some criticism is directed against the reserved option
to surrender, but it is difficult to perceive how it could
be declared inequitable. If it was not exercised the lessee
would be bound by his covenants, and if exercised the
lessor would be free to deal with the premises as he chose.
A surrender was not to affect any existing liability, but
only to avoid those "thereafter to accrue." A like clause
is in the subsequent lease and, according to the evidence
and several reported decisions, is of frequent occurrence
in such instruments. We conclude that there is nothing
in the terms of the lease which requires that equitable
relief be withheld.
While the complainants, as*found by the Master, paid
all the rental required by the terms of the lease and while
they paid most of it in advance of the time stipulated,
the first two payments were not seasonably made, and
this is urged as a ground for refusing equitable relief. The
objection is not well taken. The rental was not in arrears
when the subsequent lease of August 9, 1906, was given,
and there was no attempt at any time to forfeit or put an
end to the lease because of the omissions to pay strictly
in advance. While there was no provision in the lease
for a forfeiture, the subject was covered by an Illinois
statute. Hurd's Rev. Stat. of 1905, c. 80, § 8. Under it
the lessor could have demanded the rent in arrears and
have notified the complainants in writing that unless

payment was made within a time named in the notice,
not less than five days thereafter, the lease would be
terminated; and upon a failure to pay within that time
he could have treated the lease as ended. But there was
no such demand or notice, and consequently no failure
to comply with either. As interpreted by the Supreme
Court of the State, the statute confers upon a lessee who
omits to pay rent at the time it is due a right to cure his
default by paying at any time prior to demand and notice
or within the time named in the notice. Chadwick v.
Parker, 44 Illinois, 326; Chapman v. Kirby, 49 Illinois,
211; Woods v. Soucy, 166 Illinois, 407. Here the default
was cured in advance of any demand or notice and thereafter the complainants' rights were the same as if the
default had not occurred.
In the accounting Solley and his associates were charged
with the value, in the pipe line where the same was sold,
of all the oil taken by them from the premises, save the
one-eighth part going to the lessor as a royalty, and error
is assigned upon this because no deduction was made
for the cost of the improvements and operations whereby
the oil was taken from the earth and delivered at the
pipe line. As respects the cost incurred prior to August 1,
1907, we think the objection is well taken, for up to that
time Solley and his associates were in actual ignorance
of the earlier lease and were proceeding in the honest
belief that the later lease, assigned to them by Willett,
was the only one upon the premises. They paid a substantial sum for it, were let into possession by the lessor,
and were not conscious that they were invading the rights
of others. True, the prior lease had been properly recorded, but as they consulted an abstractor before consummating the transaction with Willett and were advised
that the title was clear, the constructive notice resulting
from the recording of the prior lease was not inconsistent
with an honest, though mistaken, belief on their part

GUFFEY v. SMITH.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

that they had acquired a perfect right to take and dispose
of the oil. But the expenses incurred after August 1,
1907, are upon a different footing. On that date Solley
and his associates were actually and fully informed of
the prior lease and of the complainants' purpose to insist upon the rights conferred by it and to obtain redress
for the invasion of those rights, so what was done thereafter cannot be regarded as anything less than a wilful
taking and appropriation of the oil which was subject
to the complainants' superior right. These views are
amply sustained by our decisions. Woodenware Co. v.
United States, 106 U. S. 432; Benson Mining Co. v. Alta
Mining Co., 145 U. S. 428, 434; Pine River Logging Co. v.
United States, 186 U. S. 279; United States v. St. Anthony
Railroad, 192 U. S. 524, 542. See also Central Coal Co. v.
Penny, 173 Fed. Rep. 340; Bender v. Brooks, 103 Texas,
329; Gladys City Oil Co. v. Right of Way Oil Co., 137 S.
W. Rep. 171, 182.
We conclude that the decree in the Circuit Court was
right save that the accounting should have proceeded
along the lines just indicated, and those improvements
the cost of which should have been deducted in the accounting, that is, those made before August 1, 1907,
should have been awarded to the complainants.
The decrees below are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court, as successor to the Circuit
Court, with directions that the accounting and the decree
be conformed to the views herein expressed.
Decree reversed.
