ruling in the present case, he can, by running a new line,
take in 200 feet of a wharf outside of an old line and then
oust the owner from the possession and use of that property without compensation.
The wharf here involved may not be of great value,
but my view of the harm done the Appellant and of the
possibility of like serious consequences to a multitude of

persons who have built and invested in these costly and
useful instrumentalities of commerce compel me to dissent
from the judgment.

STATE OF NEW YORK, EX REL. INTERBOROUGH

RAPID TRANSIT COMPANY v. SOHMER, COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 129.

Argued January 18, 19, 1915.-Decided April 12, 1915.

An exemption from taxation of a person constructing and operating
a railroad in respect to his or their interest therein under said contract and in respect to the rolling stock and other equipment of the
railroad does not extend to a tax or the privilege to operate as a corporation in case the parties decide to operate the road in a corporate
form.
The Court of Appeals of New York having held that the right to be
a corporation was not an interest under the New York subway contract involved in this case, and that the exemption from taxation
contained in that contract did not extend to such privilege, this
court accepts that construction although it is not conclusive upon it.
207 N. Y. 270, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the validity of certain assessments and provisions of the tax statutes of the State of

INTERBOROUGH TRANSIT CO. v. SOHMER. 277
237 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

New York under the contract clause of the Federal Constitution, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. George W. Wickersham and Mr. Ralph Norton, with
whom Mr. James L. Quackenbush was on the brief, for
plaintiff in error:
The contracts authorized by the legislature of New
York exempted the person, firm or corporation operating
the railways constructed under their provisions from all
taxation in any form, whether under the guise of a franchise tax or otherwise, in respect to his, its or their interest
under the contract, and in respect to the rollhig stock
and all other equipment. of said road, excepting real property owned or employed by it in connection therewith.
The legislature and the parties to the contract understood and intended that contracts under the Rapid Transit
Act should be made between the city and a corporation,
and that the exemption clause should protect the latter
from any form of taxation which should affect its interest
under such contracts.
The contract for exemption, binding upon the State in
favor of the original contractors in contracts Nos. 1 and 2
respectively from the date of their execution, enured to
the benefit of the plaintiff in error upon the assignment
to it of those contracts pursuant to the provisions of the
amending act of 1902, and became operative from and
after the commencement of operation by it of the railways
constructed under said.respective contracts.
Until the effort to tax plaintiff in error on its franchises
under the Consolidated Laws of 1909 (chapter 62), the
decisions of the courts uniformly sustained its claim of
.immunity under the contracts and statutes above cited.
The literal construction given by the Court of Appeals
to the provisions of §§ 182 and 184 of the Consolidated
Tax Law of 1909 is as erroneous as was .the literal construction of § 185 which was condemned by that court;

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

237 U. S.

but if such construction is sound, or binding upon this
court, the statute is void as against plaintiff in error,
because it impairs the obligation of the contracts exempting it from taxation in respect to its interests under those
contracts.
The impairment of the obligation of its contracts which
exempt it from taxation, complained of by plaintiff in
error, is occasioned by the construction given by the state
courts of New York to statutes enacted subsequently to
the acts of the legislature authorizing such contracts of
exemption, and statutes enacted subsequently to the
making of said contracts.
The assessments, in so far as they are based upon
dividends on the capital stock of the plaintiff in error, all
of which is invested in the equipment and operation of the
rapid transit railways, and upon the gross earnings derived
from such operation, are in direct violation of the exemption from taxation under which plaintiff in error entered
into contracts for the equipment and operation of such
railways, and constitute a taking of its property without
due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.
On the whole case, therefore, it is submitted that the
state court erred in holding plaintiff in error subject to
taxation under §§ 182 and 184 of the Tax Law upon its
capital stock, based upon the dividends earned and declared thereon, and upon its gross earnings from the rapid
transit railways; and that the judgment of the state court
should be modified accordingly.

Assuming that this court has the right to construe,
independently of the decision of the state court, § 35,
yet it will construe it as not exempting plaintiff in error
from corporate franchise taxation under the Tax Law of
the State of New York.

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Argument for Defendant in Error.

237 U. S.

Assignments of contracts to plaintiff in error did not
carry with them the exemption under § 35.
No Federal question is involved, because there was no
law involved subsequently passed impairing the obligation
of contracts under the constitutional provision.
Neither the construction of the aforesaid tax laws by the
Court of Appeals nor the assessment imposed upon the
plaintiff in error under them, constitutes an impairment
of the obligation of a contract under article I, § 10,
clause 1 of the Constitution of the United States.
The corporate franchise taxes imposed upon the plaintiff in error for the years in question did not constitute a
taking of property without due process of law, in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Section 35 does not constitute a contract of the Federal
Constitution under the constitutional provision as to the
impairment of contracts.
This court will not disturb the construction given by a
state court to a state statute, even if the statute constitute
a contract under the constitutional provision, unless it is
manifestly clear that the state court was in error.

MR. JUSTICE HoI.mEs delivered the opinion of the court.
This was a certiorari to review assessments made by the
Comptroller after a previous assessment had been set
aside by the Court of Appeals. 200 N. Y. 93. The present
assessments were upheld. 207 N. Y. 270. The plaintiff
in error alleges that the tax laws construed to authorize
them impair the obligation of contracts, contrary to Article I, § 10, of the Constitution of the United States.
Successive acts were passed by the legislature of New
York for the establishment of a rapid transit system in
cities of above one million inhabitants. Under c. 752
of the Laws of 1894 the City of New York determined
to build a subway, and .in pursuance of the statute made
a contract with one McDonald, on February 21, 1900,
by which he undertook to construct the railroad for
$35,000,000. The statute required that the person, firm
or corporation so contracting should, at his or its own
expense equip, maintain and operate the road for a term
of years, paying as rent a sum equal to the interest on
the bonds to be issued by the City for the construction
of the road, and a certain contribution to a sinking fund.
By § 35, "The person, firm or corporation operating such
road, shall be exempt from taxation in respect to his,
their or its interest therein under said contract and in
respect to the rolling stock and other equipment of said
road, but this exemption shall not extend to any real
property which may be owned or employed by said person,.
firm or corporation in connection with the construction
or operation of said road." This section was amended by
c. 729, § 4, Laws of 1896, to specify what the equipment
to be furnished by the person, firm or corporation operating
the road should include, and continued: "Such person,

OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Opinion of the Court.

237 U. S.

firm or corporation shall be exempt from taxation in
respect to his, their or its interest under said contract
and in respect to the rolling stock and all other equipment
of said road, but this exemption shall not extend to any
real property which may be owned or employed by said
person, firm or corporation in connection with the said
road." Reenacted without change on April 23, 1900.
Laws of 1900, c. 616, §4. This is the contract relied upon
and the statute may be assumed to have offered a contract that was accepted, as it seems to have been assumed
to have by the state courts. We may assume also that
the constitutional question is open, and that the only
matter for us is whether the obligation of the contract
Las been impaired by what was done.
The petitioner was incorporated under the Statutes of
New York for the purpose of equipping, maintaining and
operating the rapid transit railroad in the City of New
York, and, pursuant to the rapid transit act and the
contract, the operating part of the latter was transferred
to it on July 10, 1902. A second contract for an extension
of the road made with an intervening corporation on
July 21, 1902, also was assigned to it in like manner on
August 10, 1905, since which time the petitioner has operated the road. It may be assumed that the petitioner is
entitled to the benefit of the exemption recited above.
The petitioner also operates under a lease the elevated
railroads of the Manhattan Railway Co., and the earlier
above-mentioned attempt to tax it was under § 185 of
the tax laws for the years ending on June 30, 1907, 1908
and 1909. This section levied on corporations operating
elevated railroads not operated by steam a franchise
tax of one per cent. of gross earnings from all sources
within the State, etc., and the attempt was to tax the
petitioner upon its receipts from the subway as well as
from the elevated road. The Court of Appeals held that
the words 'from all sources' in the taxing act did not

INTERBOROUGH TRANSIT CO. v. SOHMER.
237 U. S.

283

Opinion of the Court.

extend to earnings from the distinct enterprise of the
subway merely because it happened to be carried on by
the same 'corporation that operated the elevated road.
But it intimated an. opinion that there was nothing to
hinder a franchise tax.
The present taxes are levied under §§ 182, 184 and 185
of the tax laws for the years 1907, 1908, 1909 and 1910.
The petitioner does not dispute the tax under § 185 in
respect of its operation of the elevated railroad, but does
dispute the taxes levied under §§ 182 and 184. By the
former of these a tax computed on the basis of its capital
stock is levied on every corporation doing businsss in the
State, 'for the privilege .of doing business or exercising its
corporate franchises in this State'; and by § 184 an additional tax ot five-tenths of one per cent. upon gross earnings within the. State is imposed on transportation companies not liable to taxation under § 185. The petitioner
contends that the contract made by the subway statute,
§ 35, exempts it from these taxes. It makes some preliminary argument as to the scope of the taxing acts, but
we understand the Court of Appeals to read them as
taxing the' right to be a corporation and to operate as
such, in the case of domestic companies, Cornell Steamboat Co. v. Sohmer, 235 U. S. 549, 558, 559, and we see no
reason for attempting to go behind its decision. New
Orleans v. Stempel, 175 U. S. 309, 316. Therefore the
matter for this Court to consider is narrowed to whether
the words of the exemption extend to a tax on the privilege
to operate as a corporation under a charter from the State,
in case the interested parties should decide to operate
their road in corporate form. If such a tax is allowable
we understand that there is no dispute as to amounta or
the mode of measuring it. Whether it be admitted or not,
if the franchise to operate the subway as a corporation
can be taxed in this case, we can see no difference in the
legitimacy of adopting as a measure of the tax property

237 U. S.

that. is exetnpted by contract or property exempted by
a simple law. Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 165.
The petitioner's counsel put with great force the difficulties and apprehensions that beset the subway enterprise at the beginning, the need of attracting capital,
and instances of popular understanding that the exemption
was of universal scope for the time that the subway was
to be run by a lessee before it went into the City's hands.
But a business proposition involving the outlay of very
large sums cannot be and is not taken by the parties concerned according to offhand impressions; it is scrutinized
phrase by phrase and word by word. Scrutinizing it in
that way the Court of Appeals observed that the exemption was from taxation in respect of the person's or corporation's interest under the contract. However probable
and expected it may have been that a corporation would
run the road, it was left possible for a natural person to
do it, as in fact an individual took and held the first contract for two years. The exemption applied to one to the
same extent as to the other-for either would have the
same interest under the contract as the other. The right
to be a corporation, even when the corporation was created
and was expected to be created to carry out the purposes
of the act, was not an interest under the contract, but only
a very great convenience for acquiring and using that
interest. For these reasons the Court of Appeals held
that that right might be taxed. Cornell Steamboat Co.
v. Sohmer, 235 U. S. 549, 558, 559.
The construction of the statute by the Court of Appeals
although not conclusive upon its meaning as a contract
is entitled to great deference and respect. As a literal
interpretation it is undeniably correct, and we should not
feel warranted in overruling it because of a certain perfume of general exemption. We must accept the words
used in their strict sense.
Order affirmed.
