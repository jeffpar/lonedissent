SAWYER v. GRAY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 632.

Argued April 22, 1915.-Decided June 1, 1915.

Danielsv. Wagner, ante, p. 547, followed to the effect that the Secretary
of the Interior has no discretionary power to refuse to allow land
properly selected for exchange under the Forest Lieu Land Act of
June 4, 1897, to be patented -to an applicant who has complied with
all statutory requirements in regard to such exchange.

facts, which involve the construction of the Forest
Lieu Lands Act of 1897 and the extent of discretionary
power on the Secretary of the Interior to reject applications for exchange of lands thereunder, are stated in the
opinion.

Mr. Francis W. Clements, with whom Mr. Alexander
Britton and Mr. Evans Browne were on the brief, for appellants.
Mr. H. H. Field, with whom Mr. F. M. Dudley was on
the brief, for appellees.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE

delivered the opinion of the

court.
This case is controlled by Daniels v. Wagner, No. 238,
ante, p. 547, recently decided. The suit was brought for

SAWYER v. GRAY.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

the purpose of obtaining a decree recognizing the claim
of ownership of the complainants to the west half of section 32, Township 11 North, Range 4 East of the Willamette Meridian, County of Lewis, State of Washington, and
of further having it decreed that the defendants holding
under patents of the United States were subject to a tru'st
in favor of the complainants because the Land Department by a mistake of law had patented the land to the
defendants or their assignors when, if the law had been
complied with, the patents should have been issued to the
complainants. Some of the defendants were the original
patentees and others held under assignments of right
based upon such patents and as to all the bill explicitly
charged actual notice or such a state of fact as would constitute constructive notice and want of good faith.
The facts as alleged in the complaint were briefly these:
On March 29, 1900, the complainants, or F. A. Hyde &
Company under whom they held, applied to the Local
Land Officer at Vancouver, Washington, to enter 1120
acres of unappropriated public lands under the Act of
June 4, 1897, in lieu of lands in California owned by F. A.
Hyde & Co., which had been included in the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Forest Reserve. The bill alleged that
all the necessary steps to comply with the law and regulations concerning the selectiorr of the lieu land had been
complied with. It was further averred that at the time
this application was filed there was pending in the Local
Land Office an application of the State of Washington for
a survey of the township in which the lieu land applied
for was situated to enable the State to make selections of
land which it was entitled under the law to make and which
it was the duty of the State to make within sixty days after
survey. It was alleged that the lieu land application was
forwarded by the local land officers to the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, as it was their duty under the
law to do, and that the same was rejected by the Commis-

sioner of the General Land Office on the ground that the
land was not subject to the lieu entry because of the
pendency of the application of the State for survey, and
that the action of the Commissioner was affirmed by the
Secretary of the Interior. The bill charged that under
the law and the settled practice of the Land Department
the rejection of the application was wrong as it should have
been held in abeyance to await the completion of the survey and the selection to be made by the State within the
limits of the survey under its asserted rights, and after
the selection by the State should have then attached to
the land provided the land was not included in the selection made by the State. The bill further alleged that on
March 2, 1902, after the action of the Secretary of the
Interior above stated, the complainants, or F. A. Hyde &
Company under whom they claimed, made a further
application to be allowed to enter the land in controversy;
that is, the west half of section 32, township 11 north,
range 4 east of the Willamette' Meridian in Lewis County,
Washington, as lieu land, the land to which said entry related being included in the larger area previously applied
for and rejected under the circumstances stated. It was
averred that at the time said application was made the
survey asked for by the State of Washington was no
longer pending because it had been completed and the
State had made its selection of lands within the area of the
survey, which selections did not include the land in question. The existence of notice actual or constructive and
the want of good faith was also charged as against the
defendants concerning the fact of this application. It
was moreover alleged that it had become a custom in the
Department to allow persons who owned land which had
been included in forest reserves on full compliance with all
the provisions of law to give a power of attorney to make
selections of lieu lands under the Act of 1897 and that the
papers establishing the surrender to the United States of

Opinion of the Court.

the land and the power of attorney evidencing the rightl
to make a new selection in lieu thereof were known as
lieu scrip; but that the Department had passed an order
suspending all right to make lieu entries based upon what
was known as Hyde scrip, that is, the surrender by F. A.
Hyde & Company of land situated in a reserve as a basis
for the selection of lieu. land. It was alleged that under
this order, without rejecting the particular application of
the complainants which was pending for action, the Land
Department in violation of law and the rights of the complainants had patented the land covered by the second
application to the defendants or those under whom they
held. Hence the relief which we have at the outset stated
was prayed.
The bill was demurred to for want of equity. The demurrer was sustained. The case Was taken to the Circuit
Court of Appeals, where the judgment was affirmed, the
court resting its opinion in express terms upon the ruling
which had been previously made by it in Daniels v. Wagner, which ruling has been here since reversed in the case
referred to at the outset.
In the discussion at bar reference is made by the appellees to the first application to enter the land pending the
request of the State for a survey and reliance is placed upon
that fact to establish that the decree below rests upon ani
independent ground of law and fact not involving the
existence of the discretionary power passed upon in the
Daniels Case. But conceding, for the sake of the argument
only the soundness of the contention, this does not control the case, as the rights of the complainants are in addition based upon the second application to make the lieu
entry, which, as we have seen, was filed after the survey
and after the State had made such selections as it desired
and after the time for selections by it had expired. The
case therefore must necessarily rest upon the general action
of the Department concerning what was known as Hyde

scrip, and this in view of the manner in which the right
was asserted necessarily raises the question of the existence
of the discretionary power which was passed upon in the
Daniels Case, a result clearly indicated by the action of the
court below in basing its ruling in this case upon that which
it had previously made in the Daniels Case. We think
therefore that as our previous decision in the Daniels Case
unmistakably establishes that the ground upon which the
court maintained the demurrer in this case was an erroneous one, it must follow, as there is no ground independent of that upon which the action of the court can be
sustained, that the decree must be reversed and the case
remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this
opinion.
