OCTOBER TERM, 1914.
Syllabus.

237 U. S.

We are of the opinion that Congress used the words
'employd' and 'employed' in the statute in their natural
sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation
of employer and employ6. It was well known that there
were on interstate trains persons engaged in various serv-

ices for other masters. Congress, familiar with this situation, did not use any appropriate expression which could
be taken to indicate a purpose to include such persons
among those to whom the railroad company was to be
liable under the Act.
We conclude that the plaintiff, in error was not an employ6 of the defendant company within the meaning of
the Employers' Liability Act, and that the judgment
must be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

LOUISVILLE

& NASHVILLE RAILROAD
PANY v. MAXWELL.

COM-

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
TENNESSEE.
No. 181.

Submitted March 8, 1915.-Decided April 5, 1915.

Under the Act to Regulate Commerce the duly filed tariff of the carrier
must be charged by it and paid by the shipper or passenger without
deviation therefrom.
Shippers and travelers are charged by the duly filed tariff and must
abide thereby, unless it is found to be unreasonable by the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Neither misquotation of rates nor ignorance i an excuse for charging
or paying less or more than the filed rate.
Although a passenger might have gone and returned by direct route
to and from the point of destination, if he expressed the desire to go
and come by a differbnt route via specified points, he must pay the
filed tariff rates for the route taken, notwithstanding a misquotation

made by the carrier's agent and accepted by him in good faith.
Such a mistake is not a mere misrouting by error of the carrier which
would relieve the passenger.
In a case here under ยง 237, Jud. Code, if the filed tariffs are not included
in the record, this court takes the findings of the state court.
If the tariffs are not included in the record of a case to recover excess
over. an undercharge, and this court reverses a judgment against
the carrier on the findings of the state court, and it appears on further
proceedings that there was no undercharge, the carrier cannot
recover in the court below.

THE facts, which involve the construction of the Act
to Regulate Commerce and the right of the carrier to
recover from a passenger the amount of an undercharge
on sale of railroad tickets, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. John B. Keeble an I Mr. Ed. T. Seay for plaintiff
in error, submitted.
Mr. John A. Pitts and Mr. K. T. McConnico for defendant in error, submitted.
MR. JUSTICE HUGflES delivered the opinion of the court.
This action was brought, before a Justice of the Peace
in Tennessee, by the Louisville & Nashville Railroad
Company to recover $58.30 as the amount of an alleged
undercharge on the sale of railroad tickets. Judgment
for the defendant was affirmed by the . Court of Civil
Appeals und by the Supreme Court of the State. The
case comes here on error.
The facts, which were said to be undisputed, were
found by the state court to be as follows:
Defendant in error, G. A. Maxwell, after repeated
interviews, and correspondence, with the. representatives
of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company in regard
to rates on round trip tickets to Salt Lake City, pur-

-chased on or about the first day of June, 1910, "two
passenger tickets from Nashville, Tennessee, to Salt
Lake .City, by way of Chicago, Ill., Denver, Qolo., and
routed to return by Denver, Colo., Amarillo and Fort
Worth, Texas, and Memphis, Tennessee, and paid for
each ticket the sum of $49.50.
"There were at the time, -published rates under the
provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act by which
โข fares over the route actually traveled, going and coming,
-aggregated $78.65 each, or $29.15 each more than was
charged and collected therefor, making a difference of
$58.30 between the amount paid by Mr. Maxwell for
the tickets in question, and the amount that should have
been charged and collected.
"Mr. Maxwell was informed when he first made inquiry about the tickets in January, that there were no
special rate tickets at that time, but likely would be by
May or June first. He then, and on several occasions
thereafter, made known his desire to go to Salt Lake
City by one route, and return by another, and was told
that he could not be furnished reduced rates except by
going and coming over the same route, but after repeated
inquiries, and the correspondence referred to, he was
informed that he could make the trip on reduced rates one
way, and return another; and when he went finally to
purchase the two tickets, he stated to the agent that he
wanted to go by way of Chicago and Denver and return
by way of Stamford, Texas, and was given the tickets
routed as hereinbefore noted, at the rates mentioned.
At that time, he in fact could have gone to Salt Lake
City at the rate which he paid, but over other routes, going
and returning through Chicago and Denver, or through
St. Louis and Denver, or through Memphis and Denver,
or going through St. Louis and Denver and returning
through Denver, Amarillo and Memphis.
"Mr. Maxwell was in no way at fault in the matter.

LOUIS. & NASH. R. R. v. MAXWELL.
237 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

He did no more than tell the agent the points to which he
wished to go and make it known that he did not wish to
go and return by the same route. The agent fixed the
routing in the tickets and named the fare, and Maxwell
paid without further question."
Under the Interstate Commerce Act, the rate of the
carrier duly filed is the only lawful charge. Deviation
from it is not permitted upon any pretext. Shippers and
travelers are charged with notice of it, and they as well
as the carrier must abide by it, unless it is found by the
Commission to be unreasonable. Ignorance or misquotation of rates is not an excuse for paying or charging
either less or more than the rate filed. This rule is undeniably strict and it obviously may work hardship in
some cases, but it embodies the policy which has been
adopted by Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce in order to prevent unjust discrimination. The Act
(ยง6) provides:
"Nor shall any carrier charge or demand or collect or
receive a greater or less or different compensation for such
transportation of passengers or property, or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in
such tariffs than the rates, fares, and charges which are
specified in the tariff filed and in effect at the time; nor
shall any carrier refund or remit in any manner or by any
device any portion of the rates, fares, and charges so
specified, nor extend to any shipper or person any privileges or facilities in the transportation of passengers or
property, except such as are specified in such tariffs."
The scope and effect of the provisions of the statute as
to filing tariffs (both in their present form and as they stood
prior to the amendments of 1906) have been set forth in
numerous decisions. Gulf, Col. & Santa Fe Rwy. v. Hefley,

278, 284. In the Mugg Case, supra, it appeared that a
rate, less than the lawful scheduled rate, had been quoted
to the shipper by the agent of the railroad. The shipper
had relied upon the quoted rate in making his shipments
and sales. But it was held that he was bound to pay the
established rate and was not entitled to the delivery of
the goods without such payment. This was Upon the
ground that it was beyond the power of the carrier to
depart from the filed rates and that the erroneous quotation of the rate by its agent did not justify it in making
a different charge from that which was lawfully applicable to the shipment. As was said in .Kansas Southern
Rwy. Co. v. Carl, supra: "Neither the intentional nor
accidental misstatement of the applicable published rate
will bind the carrier or shipper. The lawful rate is that
which the currier must exact and that which the shipper
must pay. The shipper's knowledge of the lawful rate is
conclusively presumed, and the carrier may not be required to surrender the goods carried upon the payment
of the rate paid, if that was less than the lawful rate,
until the full legal rate has been paid."-It was "the
purpose of the Act to have but one rate, open to all alike
and from which there could be no departure." Boston
& Maine R. R. v. Hooker, supra, p. 112. The rule is
applicable to the, transportation of passengers and their

baggage.
The Supreme Court of the State fully recognized the
established principle, but stated that the majority of the
court were of the opinion that it was not controlling here,

Opinion of the Court.

for the reason that Mr. Maxwell could have gone to the
point of destination, Salt Lake City, on one route, and
have returned on another route, at the price actually
paid for the tickets, and that, therefore, 'the mere misrouting of the ticket by the Railroad Company' was not a
discrimination. In thus holding, the assumption was that
there was dn error on the part of the Railroad Company
in the routing, by which he was misled, and that, as it is
said, Mr. Maxwell 'could have gone to Salt Lake City at
the price paid over other routes going and returning
through Chicago and Denver or going through St. Louis
and Denver and returrling through Denver, Amarillo and
Memphis; either one of which would have met. his requirements.'
We are unable to reach the conclusion that this ground
of decision was available under the findings of fact. A
misstatement, or misquotation, of the rate over a given
route is one thing; misrouting is a different matter.' We
do not think that it can be said that there is a 'misrouting,'
in any proper sense, when the route given by the company
is that requested by the shipper or passenger. See Spreckels v. Monongahela R. R., 18 I. C.'C. Rep. 190, 191. According to the findings of fact, it appears that, after his
interviews and correspondence, Mr. Maxwell finally
'stated to the agent that he wanted to go by way of
Chicago and Denver, and return by way of Stamford,
Texas.'
His request covered four points,-Chicago,
Denver, Salt Lake City, and Stamford. It appears by the
findings that he could have gone, at the rate actually
paid, through St. Louis and Denver, returning through
Denver, Amarillo and Memphis,- or that he could have
made the trip, at that rate, 'going and returning through
Chicago and Denver, or through St. Louis and Denver,
or through Memphis and Denver.' But according to the
findings, he was not entitled at the rate which he paid
to make the trip through Chicago and Denver, returning

as he desired through Stamford, Texas. We are not concerned with the reasons for the differences in rates on the
various routes, but merely with the fact that they existed
under the applicable tariffs as filed. Under -these tariffs,
the findings of fact show that the amount paid was less
than the amount due over the route selected.
The counsel for the defendant in error insist that as the
tariffs are not included in the record, the judgment cannot
be reversed. But, as We have said, we take the findings of
the state court.
It is further insisted that, on reference to the tariffs,
it will appear that the Railroad Company is mistaken in its
assertion that there was an undercharge, and that the
rate actually paid was, in truth, the lawful rate. The tariffs-have not been submitted to us and it is sufficient to
say that if in the further proceedings in this case it shall
appear that the defendant in error is right in this contention, it will necessarily follow that the Railroad Company
will be unable to recover. But we cannot so hold upon the
case as it is now presented.
The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
