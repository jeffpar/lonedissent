to benefits. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. -Bradley,
supra.
In the present instance, the record shows that the drainage district, as organized, embraces a large area with
many proprietors, and that, after contest in the original
proceeding, the District Court made its deliberate order
that the enterprise would be a public utility and conducive
to the 'public eonvenience health and welfare.' Nothing
appears to warrant a different conclusion. Neither in the
statutory provisions as construed by the state court nor
in their application in the particular case is there basis
for finding that the plaintiffs in error have been deprived
of their property without due process of law. Rather must
it be said that the ruling as to the authority of the State
to make the condemnation for the described purpose has,
from the standpoint of the Federal Constitution, abundant
support in the decisions of this court. Wurts v. Hoagland,

HOUCK v. LITTLE RIVER DRAINAGE DISTRICT.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 35. Argued October 27, 28, 1915.-Decided November 29, 1915.
So far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, a State may defray
the entire expense of creating, developing and improving a political
subdivision from state funds raised by general taxation--or it may
apportion the burden among the municipalities in which the improvements are made-or it may create tax districts to meet authorized outlays.
The State may, so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, create

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

tax districts for special improvements directly by the legislature,
or may delegate their institution through court proceedings, and
the propriety of such delegation is a matter for the State alone,
not reviewable by this court.
A State may by statute directly, or by appropriate legal proceeding,
fix the basis of taxation or assessment for a proper governmental
outlay, and, unless palpably arbitrary, such action does not violate
the due process provision of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The power of taxation is not to be confused with that of eminent
domain; it is not necessary to show special benefits in order to lay a
tax which is an enforced contribution for the payment of public
expenses.
A State may, in its discretion, lay assessments for public work in proportion either to position, frontage, area, market value or estimated
benefits; and; unless the exaction is a flagrant abuse of power, it
does not amount to deprivation of property without due process
of law.
An initial fixed tax per acre laid by a statute of Missouri on a taxdistrict properly organized under the state law for preliminary
expenses of starting a public work, such as drainage of the district,
does not deprive the owners of property therein of their property
without due process of law, there being manifestly in this case
nothing arbitrary in the prescribed rate and it not being necessary
to base such a tax upon special benefits.
The statute of Missouri authorizing the imposition of the tax being
in force prior to the formation of the taxing district, the tax cannot
be considered as retrospective and violative of the due process clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment on that ground.
The state court having held that a charter of a taxing district as a
public corporation did not constitute a contract that the laws it
was created to administer would not be changed, this court sees no
reason to disturb the decision.
248 Missouri, 373, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under the
Fourteenth Amendment of the Drainage District Act of
Missouri, and of a tax levied thereunder, are stated in
the opinion.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

239 U. S.

The state court erred in adjudging that § 5538, Rev.
Stat. Missouri, 1909, does not contemplate taking private
property for public use without the compensation required by "due process of law" provided for by the Fourteenth Amendment.
What may be done under this section construed in
connection with all the Missouri drainage laws is the
constitutional test to be applied, and plaintiffs in error
are neither estopped nor barred from challenging this law.

The state court erred in adjudging that the enforcement

without compensation-that is to say, without "due

Even if the drainage plan should succeed, still no compensation can result so far as concerns the large area of
plaintiffs' lands necessarily condemned for public use,
and which same area is assessed with this tax. Squaw

Mr. Robert B. Oliver and Mr. Robert B. Oliver, Jr., with
whom Mr. Allen Laws Oliver was on the brief for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HuGHEs-delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiffs in error, owners of several thousand acres
embraced within the Little River Drainage District, of
Missouri, brought this suit to restrain the collection of. a
tax of twenty-five cents per acre levied generally upon
the lands within the district for the purpose of paying
its preliminary expenses. The district was organized in
1907 under the provisions of article 3, chapter 122, Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1899, as amended by the act
of April 8, 1905. Its board of supervisors appointed engineers who made surveys and recommended a plan of
drainage. Upon the adoption of this plan, in November,
1909, commissioners were appointed for the purpose of
viewing the tracts within the district and assessing benefits and damages. Pending the proceedings of these commissioners, the tax in question was levied under the apt
of June 1, 1909, now § 5538 of the Revised Statutes of
Missouri, 1909, which provides as follows:
"Sec. 5538. Levy of twenty-five cents per acre may be
made for preliminary work.-As soon as any drainage
district shall have been organized under order of the
circuit court, and a board of supervisors are elected and
qualified, such board of supervisors shall have the power

239 U. S.

and authority to levy upon each acre of land in the district, not to exceed twenty-five cents per acre, as a level
rate, to be used for purpose of paying expenses of organization, for topographical and other surveys, for plans of
drainage, for expenses of assessing benefits and damages
and other incidental expenses' which may be necessary,
before entering upon the main work of drainage. Any
district which may have proceeded without such levy
may, if in the opinion of its board of supervisors it be
desirable to do so, make such level assessments for such
purpose, and if such items of expense have already been
paid in whole or in part from other sources, the surplus
shall be paid into the general fund of the district, and
such levy may be made although the work proposed may
have failed or have been found impractical."
The amended petition averred in substance that as to
the plaintiffs all the proceedings had been in invitum; that
the lands in the district varied in value; that no benefits
had accrued or would accrue to the plaintiffs' lands either
from the expenditure of the moneys sought to be raised
by the tax or from the carrying out of the proposed plan;
that a large portion of the lands 'in the district, and those
of the plaintiffs in large part, were to be condemned for
a right of way for ditches and catch basins; and that the
tax had been levied against every acre within the district,
as a level tax, without regard either to relative value or to
benefits, or to the fact that portions of the lands would be
damaged and other portions would be taken by condemnation, or that a large extent of territory, if added to the
district as had been proposed, would receive the benefit
of the tax without being charged with any part. The levy
of the tax, and the act authorizing it, were assailed as being
contrary to the constitution of the State of Missouri and
also to the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibiting deprivation of property without due process of
law.

261

Opinion of the Court.

Upon demurrer to the petition, the parties stipulated
that the sole question to be determined was whether
§ 5538 (supra) was constitutional. The trial court held
it to be valid and dismissed the petition. After affirmance
in the Supreme Court of Missouri, Division One, the cause
was transferred (in view of the Federal question) to the
court in banc where the judgment was finally affirmed, the,
opinion of Division One being adopted. 248 Missouri, 373.
In considering the contention thus presented under the
Fourteenth Amendment, it must be taken to be established
that the district had been organized validly for a publio
purpose. It had been incorporated pursuant to the judgment of the Circuit Court, as in the act provided, and this
judgment had been affirmed upon appeal. Little River
Drainage District v. Railroad, 236 Missouri, 94. In the
opinion of the court in that proceeding, the tracts were
described as forming "a contiguous body of land from one
to eleven miles in width, extending in a southerly direction
for a distance of about ninety miles from Cape Girardeau
on the north, to the boundary line between Missouri and
Arkansas. Streams and watercourses heading in the
higher adjacent territory carry their waters to these low
lands where, because of insufficient channels, the waters
overflow and render much of the land uncultivable and
uninhabitable." Id., p. 103. The district is, indeed, a
conspicuous illustration of the class of enterprises which
have been authorized in order to secure the recognized
public advantages which will accrue from reclaiming and
opening to cultivation large areas of swamp or overflowed
lands. Egyptian Levee Co. v. Hardin, 27 Missouri, 495;

was constituted a political sub-division of the State for
the purpose of performing prescribed functions of government. Mound City Land & Stock Co. v. Miller, supra;
State v. Taylor, supra. These drainage districts, as the
Supreme Court of the State has said, exercise the granted
powers within their territorial jurisdiction "as fully, and
by the same authority, as the municipal corporations of
the State exercise the powers vested by their charters."
248 Missouri, p. 383.
In view of the nature of this enterprise it is obvious that,
so far as the Federal Constitution is concerned, the State
might have defrayed the entire expense out of state funds
raised by general taxation or it could have apportioned
the burden among the counties in which the lands were
situated and the improvements were to be made. County
of Mobile v. Kimball, 102 U. S. 691, 703, 704. It was
equally within the power of the State to create tax districts to meet the authorized outlayS. The legislature,
unless restricted- by the state constitution, can create such
districts directly, or, as in this case, it may provide for
their institution through a proceeding in the courts in
which the parties interested are cited to appear and
present their objections, if any. The propriety of a delegation of this sort was a question for the State alone. And
with respect to districts thus formed, whether by the
legislature directly or in an appropriate proceeding under
its authority, the legislature may itself fix the basis of
taxation or assessment, that is, it may define the apportionment of the burden, and its action cannot be assailed
under the Fourteenth Amendment. unless it is palpably
arbitrary and a plain abuse. These principles have been
established by repeated decisions. Hagar v. Reclamation

U. S. 269, 278; French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., 181
U. S. 324, 343; Wight v. Davidson, 170 U. S. 371, 379;
Wagner v. Baltimore, decided this day, ante, p. 207.
The legislature, in this instance, fixed the object and
character of the tax, and prescribed the maximum rate.
The authority to levy the tax for preliminary expenses
was to follow upon the organization of the district. The
plaintiffs in error urge that the determination at the time
the district was organized was merely preliminary and
tentative with respect to the lands to be included, and
that assessments according to ascertained benefits for the
purpose of meeting the cost of works and improvements
are reserved for subsequent proceedings, upon notice,
after surveys have been made and the plan of drainage has
been' definitely adopted. See Rev. Stat. (Mo.), §§ 5511 to
5519. It is true that the elaborate inquiry which is to
follow the organization of the district may show the advisability of bringing in other lands (Squaw Creek Drainage
District v. Turney, supra), and the statute undoubtedly
does postpone the assessment of the cost of works and
improvements until the plan of drainage has been decided upon and benefits have been determined accordingly. But none the less the organization of the district
takes effect when it is duly constituted by the judgment
of the court. The owners whose lands are embraced in the
district as proposed, and who have not signed the articles,
are summoned and their objections to the organization
and to the inclusion of their lands are heard. As a public
corporation, with defined membership, the district when
established is empowered to go forward with the expert
inVestigations and surveys which of necessity must precede the adoption of a complete scheme. The outcome of
these studies cannot ,be absolutely predicted; they may
even result in the abandonment of the project. But probable feasibility has been shown, and the district, in con-

sequence, organized. The preliminary work must then
be done and its cost must be met. It is work undertaken
by the district. The owners of the included lands (with
one vote for each acre) elect the district officers (supervisors) who are to proceed with the surveys, etc., in the
manner detailed. In the present case, the district was
created upon an adequate showing of basis (236 Missouri,
p. 138) and it is not disputed that the plaintiffs in error
received the notice to which they were entitled (Rev.
Stat. (Mo.), 1909, § 5497; Laws of Missouri, 1905, § 8252).
They were thus apprised of whatever legal consequences
attached to the formation of the district with their lands
in it. The present question therefore cannot properly be
regarded as one of notice. The imposed burden, if it be
in its nature a lawful one, is an incident to the organization
which they had abundant opportunity to contest. It is
apparent that when the district was duly organized it had
the same footing as if it had been created by the legislature
directly; and if the legislature could have established this
district by direct act and then constitutionally imposed
upon the lands within the district the ratable tax in question to pay the expenses of organization and for preliminary work, it cannot be doubted that the legislature
had power to impose the same tax upon the district as
organized under the judgment of the court.
The ultimate contention, then, is that the plaintiffs in
error cannot be subjected to this preliminary tax of
twenty-five cents an acre because their lands, as they
insist, will not be benefited by the plan of drainage. In
authorizing the tax, it is said, the legislature has departed
from the principle of benefits, and the tax is asserted to be
pro tanto an uncompensated taking of their property for
public use. But the power of taxation should not be
confused with the power of eminent domain. Each is
governed by its own principles. County of Mobile v.
Kimball, supra;Bauman v. Ross, supra; Wight v. Davidson,

HOUCK i,. LITTLE RIVER DISTRICT.

Opinion of the Court.

supra; People v. Brooklyn, 4 N. Y. 419, 424; Cooley on
Taxation, p. 430; Lewis on Eminent Domain, 3d ed.,
§§ 4, 5. A tax is an enforced contribution for the payment
of public expenses. It is laid by some rule of apportionment according to which the persons or property taxed
share the public burden, and whether taxation operates
upon all within the State, or upon those of a given class or
locality, its essential nature is the same. The power of
segregation for taxing purposes has every-day illustration
in the experiences of local communities, the members of
which, by reason of their membershp, or the owners of
property within the bounds of the political subdivision,
are compelled to bear the burdens both of the successes
and of the failures of local administration. When local
improvements may be deemed to result in special benefits,
a further classification may be made and special assessments imposed accordingly, but even in such case there
is no requirement of the Federal Constitution that for
every payment there must be an equal benefit. The
State in its discretion may lay such assessments in proportion to position, frontage, area, market value, or to benefits estimated by commissioners. Davidson v. New Orleans,
96 U. S. 97, 106; Walston v. Nevin, 128 U. S. 578, 582;
Spencer v. Merchant, supra; Bauman v. Ross, supra;
French v. Barber Asphalt Paving Co., supra; Wight v.
Davidson, supra. And, as we have said, unless the exaction is a flagrant abuse, and by reason of its arbitrary
character is mere confiscation of particular property, it
cannot be maintained that the State has exceeded its
taxing power. Wagner v. Baltimore, ante, p. 207. We find
no such arbitrary action here.- It was not necessary to base
the preliminary tax upon special benefits accruing from a
completed plan. It cannot be denied that the preliminary
work had peculiar relation to the district. The initial
inquiry, whatever its result, was for the purpose of securing the reclamation of the lands of which the district was

Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

comprised. In this inquiry, all the owners were interested.
Whether the expense of ascertaining the best method of
reclamation should subsequently be reimbursed when
final assessments were laid according to benefits ascertained to result from the execution of the final plan presents a question of policy and not of power. These outlays for organization and preliminary surveys could as
well be considered specially to concern the district, as
constituted as highways or public buildings or plans forthe same (whether consummated or abandoned) could
be said to concern counties or towns. Further, it would
seem to be clear that the State could appropriately provide for meeting the preliminary expense when it was
incurred and could determine the manner of apportionment according to the interests deemed to be affected as
they existed at the time. And in this view, it is not material to consider whether the area of the district might
subsequently be extended, or what particular lands
within it would be appropriated for ditches, reservoirs,
etc., if a plan Of drainage were adopted and carried out.
To say that the tax could not be laid except as a result of
such an inquiry would be to assert in effect that as a
preliminary tax it could not be laid at all. We know of no
such limitation upon the state power. And assuming that
the lands within the district, as organized, could be taxed
for the purpose stated, there. was manifestly nothing
arbitrary in the fixing of the prescribed, rate per acre.
It is further objected that the levy of the tax amounts
to a deprivation of property without due process of law
because of the retrospective character of the legislation,the section in question having been passed after the district was organized. As to this, it is sufficient to say that
the statute which was in force at the time of the formation
of the district contemplated liability to taxation to defray
the preliminary expenses as well as the ultimate cost of
the improvements if made (Laws of Missouri, 1905,

HOUCK v. LITTLE RIVER DISTRICT.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

§ 8252); and these preliminary outlays must be regarded
as incident to the organization for which the legislature
was competent to provide in the exercise of its taxing
power. Seattle v. Kelleher, 195 U. S. 351, 359; Wagner.v.
Baltimore, ante, p. 207.
The plaintiffs in error have also urged that § 5538 is
invalid under § 10, Art. I, of the Federal Constitution
upon the ground that it impairs the obligation of contract.
This contention was not presented by the amended petition and was not deemed by the Supreme Court of the
State, Division One, to be within the stipulation upon
which the case was tried. 248 Missouri, 382, 394. Upon
the motion to transfer the case to the court in banc, the
question under the contract clause was raised, but the
court in banc simply adopted the opinion of Division One.
Id. In that opinion, however, after referring to the
stipulation, the court proceeded to observe that the charter of the district, as a public corporation, did not constitute a contract with its members that the laws it was
created to administer Would not be changed. If this can
be considered to be a decision of the question, we see no
reason to disturb it. Laramie County v. Albany County,
92 U. S. 307, 310; New Orleans v. New Orleans Water
Works Co., 142 U. S. 79, 89; Worcester v. Street Railway
Co., 196 U. S. 539, 551; Seattle v. Kelleher, supra.
Judgment affirmed.
