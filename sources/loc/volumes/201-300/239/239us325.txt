WEBER v. FREED, DEPUTY COLLECTOR OF
UNITED STATES CUSTOMS.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW. JERSEY.
No. 644. Argued December 1, 1915.-Decided December 13, 1915.
That the power of Congress over foreign commerce is complete has been
so thoroughly settled by former decisions of this court, that to question it is frivolous.
Congress has power to prohibit importation of foreign articles from
abroad, including pictorial representations of prize fights designed
for public exhibition; and so held that the act of July 31, 1912, prohibiting such importation is not unconstitutional.
The fact that exhibitions of pictures are under state, and not Federal,
control does not affect the power of Congress to prohibit importation
of articles from foreign countries to be exhibited.
The motive of Congress in exerting its plenary power cannot be considered for the purpose of refusing to give effect to such power
when exercised.

facts, which involve the constitutionality of the act
of July 31, 1912, prohibiting the importation of pictorial
THE

representations of prize fights, are stated in the opinion.

Mr. Benjamin F. Spellman, with whom Mr. Charles A.
Towne was on the brief, for the appellant:
The act of July 31, 1912, c. 263, §§ 1, 2, and 3, is unconstitutional and void because in violation of Amendments IX and X to the Constitution of the United States.

Section one is unconstitutional and void and beyond the
power of Congress to enact under par. 3 of §8, Art. I, of the
Constitution, commonly called the Commerce Clause, as
applied to the exclusion from entry into the United States
of photographic-film positives by the owner designed to
be used for purposes of public exhibition in the United
States under his personal management, control and supervision, and not for the purpose of traffic, sale or commerce.
Photographic-film positives, imported by the owner,
designed to be used for purposes of public exhibition by
him and not for purposes of traffic, sale or commerce, are
not articles of commerce.
The public exhibition of motion pictures is not commerce; and hence the photographic-film positives referred
to in this case, being. "designed to be used" for purposes
of such exhibitions, are not instrumentalities of commerce.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for the United
States, submitted:
The contention that Congress cannot prohibit the importation of motion-picture films intended for purposes of
exhibition is frivolous, and the court should, therefore,
decline jurisdiction.
The power of Congress to rcgulate commerce with
foreign nations includes the prohibition of the introduction, importation, or transportation from abroad of any
tangible object which may be used for any gainful purpose,
regardless of the use which the importer himself intends
to make of it. Prize-fight films are articles of commerce;
and their importation for public exhibition is commercial
intercourse.

MR CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
The act of July 31, 1912, § 1, c. 263, 37 Stat. 240, makes
it unlawful "to bring or to cause to be brought into the
United States from abroad, any film or other pictorial
representation of any prize fight or encounter of pugilists, under whatever name, which is designed to be used
or may be used for purposes of public exhibition." With
this provision in force, in April, 1915, the appellant brought
to the port of entry of the City of Newark in the State
of New Jersey photographic films of a pugilistic encounter or prize fight which had taken place at Havana
and demanded of the deputy collector of customs in
charge the right to enter the films. On refusal of the
official to permit the entry appellant filed his bill of complaint to enforce the right to enter by a mandatory injunction and by other appropriate relief to accomplish
the purpose in view. The ground relied on for the relief
was the averment that the prohibition of the act of Con-

Opinion of the Court.

gress in question was repugnant to the Constitution because in enacting the same "Congress exceeded its designated powers under the Constitution of the United
States and attempted, under the guise of its powers
under the Commerce Clause, to exercise police power expressly reserved in the States." The collector moved to
dismiss on the ground that the bill stated no cause of action because the assailed provision of the act of Congress
was constitutional and therefore on the face of the bill
there was no jurisdiction to award the relief sought.
The motion was sustained and a decree of dismissal was
rendered, and it is this decree which it is sought to reverse
by the appeal which is before us, the propositions relied
upon to accomplish that result but reiterating in various
forms of statement the contention as to the repugnancy
to the Constitution of the provision of the act of Congress.
But in view of the complete power of Congress over foreign
commerce and its authority to prohibit the introduction of
foreign articles recognized and enforced by many previous
decisions of this court, the contentions are so devoid of
merit as to cause them to be frivolous. Buttfield v. Stranahan, 192 U. S. 470; The Abby Dodge, 223 U. S. 166, 176;
Brolan v. United States, 236 U. S. 216.
It is true that it is sought to take this case out of the
long-recognized rule by the proposition that it has no
application because the assailed provision was enacted
to regulate the exhibition of photographic films of prize
fights in the United States and hence it must be treated
not as prohibiting the introduction of the films, but as
forbidding the public exhibition of the films after they
are brought in-a subject to which, it is insisted, the
power of Congress does not extend. But aside from the
fictitious assumption on which the proposition is based,
it is obviously only another form of denying the power of
Congress to prohibit, since if the imaginary premise and
proposition based on it were acceded to, the contention

would inevitably result in denying the power in Congress
to prohibit importation as to every article which after
importation would be subject to any use whatever. Moreover, the proposition plainly is wanting in merit, since it
rests upon the erroneous assumption that the motive of
Congress in exerting its plenary power may be taken into
view for the purpose of refusing to give effect to such
power when exercised. Doyle v. Continental Ins. Co., 94
U. S. 535, 541; McCray v. United States, 195 U. S. 27,

TEXAS & PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v.
BIGGER.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 342.

Submitted November 30, 1915.-Decided December 13, 1915.

Where the case was tried to a jury and there was a verdict for plaintiff,
disputed questions of fact must be considered by the appellate court
as determined against defendant.
On appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming
a judgment of the trial court based on a verdict, this court is confined
to considering questions of law arising on the rulings of the court.
A defendant removing the case from the state court, and not reserving
any exception to the jurisdiction of the state court,, cannot after
pleading in, and submitting to the jurisdiction of, the Federal court
raise the question of the original jurisdiction of the state court.
A general contention that the trial court should have directed a verdict
for defendant involves the whole case, and facts and law may, as in
this case, be so intermingled as to make the latter dependent upon the
former.
