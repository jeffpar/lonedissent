cover. This refusal is the sole ground upon which error is
now asserted.
Two loaded coal cars coming from without the State
were received in the carrier's yard at Fort Wayne, Indiana. They were destined to Olds' private switch-track
connecting with the yard; and acting under instructions
Donat commenced the switching movement requisite to
place them thereon. There-was evidence tending to show
that'in order to complete this movement it became necessary to uncouple the engine from the loaded cars and
with it to remove two empty ones from the private track.
While engaged about the removal defendant in error was
injured. The trial court submitted to the jury for determination whether he was engaged in interstate commerce
at the time of the injury, and in approving such action
(224 Fed. Rep. 1021) the Circuit Court of Appeals was
clearly right. N. Y. Cent. & Hudson River R. R. v. Carr,

MASON.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.
No. 391.

Motion to dismiss or affirm submitted October 25, 1915.Decided November 8, 1915.

In a suit in the state court under the EmplQyers' Liability Act, defendant's contentions that plaintiff's intestate was not engaged in interstate commerce and that a state statute limiting amount of recovery
controlled involve Federal questions, and, unless wholly frivolous,
this court has jurisdiction.
In this case, however, as both of the propositions are so wanting in sub-

stance as not to require further argument, the judgment is affirmed
under Rule 6, paragraph 5.

Previous decisions of this cotirt have conclusively established the exclusive operation of the Employers' Liability Act over the subject
with which it deals to the exclusion of all state statutes relating
thereto.

THE facts, which involve the jurisdiction of this court

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

Illinois, 248. Two propositions are relied upon for reversal: first, a refusal to instruct a verdict on the ground
that there was no evidence tending to show either negligence or that the company or the deceased at the time of
the particular transaction from which the injury arose
was engaged in interstate commerce, and second, a further
refusal to instruct that a state statute limiting the amount
of recovery was controlling although the suit was under
the act of Congress. These contentions are Federal
(Seaboard Air Line v. Padgett, 236 U. S. 668, 673; Central
Vermont Ry. v. White, 238 U. S. 507, 509) and there is
jurisdiction, as we do not find them wholly frivolous.
Overruling the motion to dismiss, we come to consider
whether we should grant the motion to affirm, and for
that purpose we must decide whether the propositions
are so wanting in substance as not to require further argument. Rule 6, paragraph 5. We are of the opinion that
as to both propositions an affirmative answer is required.
We say this because as to the first it is apparent that
there is no ground upon which to rest the assertion that
there was no tendehcy of proof whatever on the subjects
stated, but to the contrary the record makes it clear, and
the arguments in support of the proposition demonstrate,
that it alone involves a mere dispute concerning the weight
of conflicting tendencies of proof. And the same conclusion is necessary as to the second, because in substance
and effect the want of merit in that proposition has by
necessary intendment been so conclusively established
by the previous decisions of this court concerning the
exclusive operation and effect of the Employers' Liability
Act over the subject with which it deals as to exclude all
ground for the contention which the proposition makes.
