OCTOBER TERM, f915.
Argument for the United States.

239 U. S.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. NEW YORK
AND PORTO RICO STEAMSHIP COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND
CIRCUIT.
No. 44.

Argued November 3, 1915.-Decided November 15, 1915.

Even if a statute declares a transaction void for want of certain enumerated forms, the party for whose protection the requirement is
made may waive it; void in such cases meaning only voidable at
that party's choice.
The object of Rev. Stat., § 3744, providing that certain officers of the
Government reduce all contracts to writing, is to furnish the needed
protection for the United States and not for the private individual
who does not need such protection; and, notwithstanding informality
of execution on the part of the Government, if the other contracting
parties did actually contract, he can be held to performance.
209 Fed. Rep. 1007, reversed.
THE facts, which involve the construction of § 3744,
Rev. Stat., and the liability of a contractor on a contract
with the Government for transportation of coal, are stated
in the opinion.

The Solicitor General, with whom Mr. Robert Szold was
on the brief, for the United States:
Revised Stat., § 3774, is no bar to suit by the Government on executory parol contracts.
The statute does not render the contract illegal but
only unenforceable. It affects not the validity of the contract but the remedy thereon. Clark v. United States, 95
U. S. 539; St. Louis Hay Co. v. United States, 191 U. S. 159;
United States v. Andrews, 207 U. S. 229; Browne on Stat.
of Frauds, 5th ed., § 115a.
Revised Stat., § 3774, is solely for the protection of the

Government. Clark v. United States, supra;DollarSavings
Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227; United States v.
Verdier, 164 U. S. 213.
The Government may waive compliance with statutory
forms required for its protection. Bailey v. United States,
109 U. S. 432; McGowan v. Parish, 237 U. S. 285, 294,
295, and cases cited.
Since the Government is not expressly named in the
statutes, its remedy by suit on a valid common-law contract is not barred.
The Government may take the benefit of a statute, but
it is not bound thereby unless expressly named. Stanley
v. Schwalby, 147 U. S. 508, 514; S. C., 162 U. S. 255.
The signed offer and acceptance in writing constitute
compliance with the statute. Adams v. United States,
1 Ct. Cl. 192; Johnston v. United States, 41 Ct. Cl. 76.
The statute does not apply to executed contracts and
is no bar to suit on a parol contract after performance by
plaintiff. St. Louis Hay Co. v. United States, 191 U. S.
159, 163; United States v. Andrews, 207 U. S. 229.
Mr. James H. Hayden, with whom Mr. Norman B.
Beecher and Mr. Ray Rood Allen were on the brief, for
defendant in error:
The breach of contract complained of could not have
occurred for there was no contract to break. The company
never became obligated to furnish the transportation or
to indemnify the United States.
The transportation of the Navy Department's coal to
San Francisco was a matter from which it alone could
derive benefit. In procuring the diversion of the Baker
Company's steamers the Department did not relieve the
New York and Porto Rico Steamship Company of any
obligation to furnish transportation, for no such obligation
had been assumed. The United States cannot recover on
quantum meruit.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit by the United States to recover the increased cost of transportation for coal, above a price that
the defendant had agreed to accept for the service; the
latter having notified the Government that it would not
furnish the steamers agreed. There is no dispute as to
the facts. On November 9, 1909, the plaintiff requested
in writing that the defendant make a tender for the
transportation of not less than 8,000 tons of coal from
certain Atlantic ports at the option of the plaintiff to
Mare Island or San Francisco, with stipulations as to

Opinion of the Court.

time. On November 13 the defendant submitted an offer
which the plaintiff accepted by telegraph on the same day.
On November 15 the defendant wrote acknowledging the
telegram and saying that it could advise in due course
what steamers it would tender. There was further correspondence on the footing of a mutual contract, but on
December 14, the defendant's attorney wrote stating that
it believed that a combination had been made with intent
'to cause it to make default under its engagement to
your Department or else to suffer heavy loss,' and requesting the plaintiff to procure the transportation if it
could be done. at reasonable cost, letting the writer know
the terms of any contract before it was closed. The plaintiff thereupon got the transportation elsewhere. The
declaration is in three counts; two upon the contract and
a third for money paid at the defendant's request. At
the first trial the plaintiff had judgment. 197 Fed. Rep.
995. This judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals. 206 Fed. Rep. 443. 124 C. C. A. 325. At a
second trial on this same record both parties moved that
a verdict be directed, and a verdict was directed for the
defendant. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. 209 Fed. Rep. 1007. 126 C. C. A. 668.
The only matter for our consideration is whether the
court below was right in ruling as matter of law that there
was no binding contract, and therefore we may lay on one
side some details that were dwelt upon by the defendant
but that do not affect this question. 'The ground of the
defence is Rev. Stats., § 3744. By this section it is made
the duty of the Secretaries of War, the Navy and the Interior to cause every contract made by their authority on
behalf of the Government 'to be reduced to writing, and
signed by the contracting parties with their names at the
end thereof'; all the copies and papers in relation to the
same to be attached together by a ribbon and seal, &c.
A formal proposal, varying, the defendant says, from that

which was accepted in the letters, Was sent to the defendant, and received by it on December 11, but never was
signed, and the defendant contends that, however it might
be otherwise, the statute makes the informal agreement
by correspondence void.
The statute does not address itself in terms t6 the effect
of the form upon the liability of the parties, like the Statute of Frauds. Whatever effect it has in that way is not
a matter of interpretation in a strict sense, but is implied.
The extent of the implication is to be gathered from the
purpose of the section and such other considerations as
may give us light. The section originally was part of the
Act of June 2,1862, c. 93, 12 Stat. 411, and its purpose is
manifested by the scope of the act and its title. It is
called "An Act to prevent and punish Fraud on the Part
of Officers intrusted with making of Contracts for the
Government," and this was recognized as the purpose in
Clark v. United States, 95 U. S. 539. In that case some of
the Justices thought that the decision Went too far in
treating the section as a statute of frauds even in favor
of the United States; and while it is established that a
contract not complying with the statute cannot be enforced against the Government, it never has been decided
that such a contract cannot be enforced against the other
party. The prevailing opinion cannot be taken to signify
that the informal contract is illegal since it went on to
permit a recovery upon a quantum valebat when the undertaking had been performed by a claimant against the
ULnited States. United States v. Andrews, 207 U. S. 229,
243. Of course the statute does not mean that its maker,
the Government, one of the ostensible parties, is guilty of
unlawful conduct, or that the other party is committing
a wrong in making preliminary arrangements, if later the
Secretary of the Navy does not do what the act makes it
his duty to do.
.There is no principle of mutuality applicable to a case

Syllabus.

like this, any more than there necessarily is in a statute
requiring a writing signed by the party sought to be
charged. The United States needs the protection of publicity, form, regularity of returns and affidavit, Rev.
Stats., §§ 3709, 3718-3724, 3745-3747, in order to prevent
possible frauds upon it by officers. A private person needs
no such protection against a written undertaking signed
by himself. The duty is imposed upon the officers of the
Government not upon him. We see no reason for extending the implication of the act beyond the evil that it seeks
to prevent. Even when a statute in so many words declares a transaction void for want of certain forms, the
party for whose protection the requirement is made often
may waive it, void being held to mean only voidable at
the party's choice.
Judgment reversed.

jurisdictional question June 21, 1915; briefs fied October 11, 1915.Decided November 15, 1915.
The manner of review in this court of judgments of the Supreme Court
of the Philippine Islands is regulated by the act of July 1, 1902, 32
Stat. 691.
Under the act of July 1, 1902, this court has jurisdiction to review the
judgment of the Supreme Court of the Philippine Islands in actions
in which a statute of the United States is involved.
A decision as to classification of merchandise imported into the Philippine Islands involves the construction of the Philippine Tariff Act,
and that being a statute of the United States, this court has jurisdiction to review the judgment if properly brought up.
