We repeat, therefore, that the Schillinger Case being

WHITE v. UNITED STATES.
FORD v. UNITED STATES.
APPEALS FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
Nos. 153, 154.

Argued January 7,1915.-Decided January 17, 1916.

The act of March 4, 1913, c. 148, 37 Stat. 891, granting officers of the
Navy, who had been advanced in rank, the pay and allowances of
the higher rank, applies only to officers on the active list and does
not apply to officers on the retired list who were assigned for active

service after their retirement.
In construing a statute the court will regard it as'more rational to
assume that Congress was dealing with present affairs than that
it was reopening finished transactions.
The general rule of statutes relating to duty and pay of naval officers
is found in Rev. Stat., § 1462, providing that no officer on the retired
list shall be employed in active duty except in time of war.
49Ct. Cl. 702, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of various
statutes of the United States relating -to pay of retired
naval officers while on active service, are stated in the
opinion.

Argument for the Appellants in No. 153.

Odend'hal and Mr. Spencer Gordon were on the brief, for
appellant in No. 154:
The act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 891, should be interpreted according to the usual meaning of its words.
By the usual meaning of its words the appellant comes
within its provisions and has a valid claim against the
United States.
The court should not go beyond the words of the act of
March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 891, to look for a more limited
construction.
Appellant's claim does not involve a repeal of the act of
June 7, 1900, 31 Stat. 703, and the act of August 22, 1912,
37 Stat. 328, 329, is not in point. The act of March 4,
1913, 37 Stat. 891, allows appellant active pay.
In support of these contentions see Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 255, 261; The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Huston Thompson, with
whom Mr. Richard P. Whiteley was on the brief, for the
United States.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
These claims raise the same question. The claimant
White was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy. On
June 30, 1905, he was transferred to the retired list, on his
own request, with the rank of Commander, (Navy Personnel Act of March 3, 1899, c. 413, §§ 8, 9; 30 Stat. 1004,
1006,) and on April 13, 1911, was commissioned a Commander on the retired list from June 30, 1905. (Act of
March 4, 1911; c. 266; 36 Stat. 1354.) He was continued
in active service from June 30,1905, until October 31,1911.
(Naval Appropriation Act of June 7, 1900, c. 859; 31 Stat.
684, 703.) The claimant Ford was a Captain, was retired
on May 19, 1902, under Rev. Stats., § 1444, with the rank
of Rear Admiral, (Act of March 3, 1899, c. 413, § 11; 30
Stat. 1007,) and was commissioned Rear Admiral on the
retired list from May 19, 1902. (Act of March 4,1911, c.
266; 36 Stat. 1354.) He was continued on active duty
from May 19, 1902, until December 25, 1907. (Act of
June 7, 1900, c. 859; 31 Stat. 703.) As provided by the
last-mentioned statute, both of these officers received the
pay and allowances of the rank they held before they were
retired. By the Naval Appropriation Act of March 4,
1913, c. 148, 37 Stat. 891, 892, it was enacted that "all
officers of the Navy who, since the third day of March,
eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, have been advanced or
may hereafter be advanced in grade or rank pursuant to
law shall be allowed the pay and allowances of the higher

grade or rank from the dates stated in their commissions."
The claims are made under this act for the difference between the pay and allowances received during active serv-

ice after retirement and that of the higher grade to which
the claimants respectively had been advanced. Demurrers to the petitions were sustained by the Court of
Claims.

The claimants, although pressing the universal application of the statute according to the literal meaning of its
words, still tacitly concede that we must go behind the
letter of the law. For while the statute says that all officers who have been advanced since the date mentioned
shall have the pay of the higher grade and says nothing
about active service, the claims are confined to the periods
of active service named, which implies a concession that
the advance in grade by itself was not enough. And this
concession was required by the fact that the statute grants
allowances as well as pay and that allowances are an incident of active duty alone.
As it stands admitted that the statute is of more limited
scope than is apparent on its face, to an untrained reader,
at least, the question is whether it is to be read as applying
to all advanced officers who have been on active service or
only to all such officers upon the active list. We are of
opinion that the latter is the true meaning and that the
decision of the Court of Claims was right. The general
rule of the statutes is found in Rev. Stats., §1462. "No
officer on the retired list of the Navy shall be employed on
active duty except in time of war." An exception, limited
to twelve years from its passage, was made by the act of
June 7, 1900, allowing officers on the retired list, in the
discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, to be ordered to
such duty as they might be able to perform, and giving
them while so employed, the pay and allowances of the
grade on the active list from which they were retired.
When the act of 1913, under which these claims are made,

WHITE v. UNITED STATES.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

was passed, this exception had expired-all services under
it had been rendered and paid for, and with other exceptions not affecting this case the general rule was in force.
It is more. rational to suppose that Congress was dealing
with present affairs than that it was reopening transactions that might be ten years old and that must have been
finished, at the latest, nearly a year before. And this construction is confirmed when we notice that the increased
pay and allowances are given from the date of the commission, that is, if the claimants are right, from the date of
their retirement without regard to the time when their
active duty began. In these cases it was continuous with
their service before retirement. But it might have begun
years afterwards and yet by the statute the date of the
increase in pay and the allowances would have been the
same.
The conclusion to which the statutes directly concerned
would lead us, is confirmed still further by consideration
of the Naval Appropriation Act of August 22, 1912, c. 335;
37 Stat. 328, 329. This act provided that thereafter, any
Naval Officer on the retired list might, with his consent,
in the discretion of the Secretary of the Navy, be ordered
to such duties as he might be able to perform, and while so
employed in time of peace should receive the pay and
allowances of an officer on the active list of the same rank,
provided that he was not to receive more than the pay and
allowances of a lieutenant, senior grade, on the active list
of like length of service, and, if his retired pay exceeded
that, then he was to receive his retired pay only. The
clash that there would be between the policy of this act
and that of 1913 if construed as the claimants would have
it construed is plain.
Finally it may be worth noticing that the reports that
introduced the en4ctment pointed out as the evil to be
remedied that under the Act of June 22, 1874, c. 392; 18
Stat. 191, the only officers who did not receive the pay of

PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY v.
MEESE.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 133.' Argued December 10, 1915.-Decided January 17, 1916.
Federal courts must accept the construction of a state statute deliberately adopted by the highest court of that State.
The highest court of the State having held, in construing the Washington Workmen's Compensation Act of 1911, that the compensation
thereby provided in the cases covered by its terms was intended
to be exclusive of every other remedy and that all causes of action
theretofore existing and not saved by its provisos were done away
with, the Federal court should accept that constructiofn.
In view of that construction, held that although the act did not specifically repeal §§ 183 and 194, Rem. & Ball. Code, the personal
representatives of an employ6, killed, while in the course, and at
the place, of his employment, by the negligence of one not his
employer, cannot maintain a suit at law therefor against the
latter.
On the record in this case it does not appear that the Workmen's
