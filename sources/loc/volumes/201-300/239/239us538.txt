duties to be performed, the general character of which are
similar.'
We are asked to overrule this departmental judgment,
and to take this service out of the broad description of
the statute relating to the duties of members of the Hospital Corps. We find no basis for such action. On the
contrary, we cannot escape the conclusion that, in view
of the provisions of the Act of Congress and of the authorized regulations with respect to the conduct of military hospitals, we are not at liberty to say that extra-duty
pay has been earned in connection with service thereinwhere there was no detail on extra duty-unless there
is a clear abuse of the necessary official discretion. No
such abuse is shown here.
The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause
remanded with direction to dismiss the claimant's
petition..
It is so ordered.

MOSS v. RAMEY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAHO.
No. 61. Argued December 9, 1915.-Decided January 10, 1916.
The inference naturally arising from the silence of the field notes and
plat that there was no island at the time of the survey, or if any, only

one of inconsiderable area and value, is refutable; and in this case the
evidence does refute such inference and demonstrates the existence
of the island in-its present condition at the time of the survey.
An error of the surveyor in failing to extend a survey over an island
in a river does not make it any the less a part of the public domain.
Fast dry land, which is neither a part of the bed of a river nor land
under water, being part of the public domain within the Territory
of Idaho did not pass to the State on admission to the Union but remained public land as before.

MOSS v. RAMEY.
239 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

Patents to lots of land abutting on a river do not include actual islands
of fast dry land and of stable foundation lying between the lots and
the thread of the stream. Whitaker v. McBride, 197 U. S. 510, distinguished.
An appellate court of a State may, without violating the Fourteenth
Amendment, correct its interlocutory decision upon a first appeal
when the same case with the same parties again comes before it;
and whether this may be done in a particular case is a local question
upon which the decision of the highest court of the State is controlling here.
25 Idaho, 1, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the title under patents of the
United States to an unsurveyed island in Snake River
between the States of Oregon and Idaho, are stated in the
opinion.
Mr. Oliver 0. Haga, with whom Mr. James H. Richards
and Mr. McKeen F. Morrow were on the brief, for plaintiffs in error:
Whether title to land which has once been the property
of the United States has passed from the Federal Government, must be resolved by the laws of the United States.

20 How. 558; Gibson v. Choteau, 13 Wall. 92.
When land patented by the United States Government
under the public land laws is shown by the official plat
of the survey as bordering on a fresh water river, the body
of water whose margin is meandered is the true boundary
and not the meander line. Hardin v. Jordan, 140 U. S.

v. Milwaukee, 10 Wall. 497.
When land is bounded by a river, the water is appuftenant to the land and constitutes one of the advantages of its situation, and a material part of its value, and
enters largely into the consideration for acquiring it, and
for the Government to later survey and dispose of the
strips of land that were left between the meander line and
the body of water purporting to have been meandered,
is an injustice to the original entryman or patentee who
acquired the meandered lots under the belief that they
extended to the river or other body of water, and a resurvey and sale of such land should not be permitted
except in case of fraud or palpable mistake in the original
survey. Cases supra, and see Lamprey v. State, 52 Minnesota, 181; Grand Rapids &c. R. R. v. Butler, 159 U. S.
87; Chandos v. Mack, 77 Wisconsin, 573.
Except in cases of omission by accident, fraud or palpable mistake, the United States has-no authority to make
surveys, subsequent to patent to the upland, of any land
between the meander line and the body of water purporting to have been meandered in the original survey. Cases
supra, and see Moore v. Robbins, 96 U. S. 530, 533; Franzini v. Layland, 120 Wisconsin, 72; Davis v. Wiebold, 139
U. S. 507; St. Louis Smelting Co. v. Kemp, 104 U. S. 636,

State v. Lake St. Clair Fishing Club, 127 Michigan,
587.
Where the Government has never complained of either
fraud or mistake in the original survey, a squatter on land
between, the meander line and the water cannot be heard
to complain that the Government has parted with title
to a larger acreage than it received pay for, and as be-

tween such squatter and the riparian owner, the latter
has the better title. Whitaker v. McBride, 197 U. S.
510.
Where a survey and patent show a river to be one of
the boundaries of the tract, it is a legal deduction that
there is no vacant land left for appropriation between the
river and the river boundary of such tract. Cases supra,
and see Churchill v. Grundy, 5 Dana, 100; St. Louis v.
Rutz, 138 U. S. 243; Ross v. Faust, 54 Indiana, 475; 23
Am. Rep. 658; Turner v. Parker, 14 Oregon, 341; 12 Pac.
Rep. 496.
Where surveys have been made and lands entered in
reliance upon the decisions of this court that the riparian
owner took to the water purporting to have been meandered, such decisions will be held to constitute rules of
property, and the riparian owner will be protected accordingly.
Material allegations of the complaint not denied by the
answer are deemed admitted, and such admissions are
conclusive on appeal. Section 4217, Idaho Rev. Codes;

Frank, 21 Montana, 192.
The claim that the land in controversy was still part
of the public domain was not raised in the trial court on
the second trial, and the Supreme Court of Idaho had no
power- to reverse that court and determine that it was
public land and that title had not passed to plaintiffs in
error. Sections 3817, 4824, Idaho Rev. Codes; Lamkin

in error was a denial of the equal protection of the laws

Where a question necessary for the determination of a
case has been presented to and decided by an appellate
court, such decision becomes the law of the case in all
subsequent proceedings in the same action and is a final
adjudication, from the consequences of which the court
cannot depart nor the parties relieve themselves. Westerfield v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 157 California, 339; Lindsay v.

Argument for Plaintiffs in Error.

This rule applies regardless of whether the previous
decision is right or wrong and is a limitation on the court's
power and not a mere rule of practice. Cases supra, and
see Chaffin V. Taylor, 116 U. S, 567; Gaines v. Caldwell,
148 U. S. 228; Hunter v. Porter, 10 Idaho, 86; Leese v.
Clark, 20 California, 388, 416.
The cases from this court relied upon by the Supreme
Court of Idaho to justify its departure from the rule of
law of the case do not sustaim its action. United States v.

Gt. West. Tele. Co. v. Burnham, 162 U. S. 339; Nor. Pac.
Ry. v. Ellis, 144 U. S. 458.
The rule of law of the case applies to intermediate
appellate courts and to the highest courts of a State where
Federal questions are involved, and if, pending a second
appeal, the rule of law on which such a decision was based
is changed by a higher court, the lower court has no power
to rcverse or modify its original decree. Silva v. Pickard,
14 Utah, 245; 47 Pac. Rep. 144; Dist. of Col. v. Brewer, 32

Graden (Colo.), 127 Pac. Rep. 319; Bank of Commerce v.
State, 96 Tennessee, 591.
Under the laws of Idaho, the remittitur from the Supreme Court went down twenty days after the decision
on the first appeal, and as such decision construed a
Federal grant and determined the rights of plaintiffs in
error to the land in controversy, the judgment of that
court became final upon the expiration of the two years
allowed for issuance of writ of error from this court, and
the Idaho Supreme Court was without power on a subsequent appeal five years later to reverse such judgment,
and its action in doing so impairs a vested right under
such Federal grant. Section 3818, Idaho Rev. Codes;

The findings of the trial court on the issue of adverse
possession were conclusive both on this court and the
state Supreme Court, and the Federal questions in this
case being decisive of the whole controversy, this court,
if it finds the decision of the state court on such questions
erroneous, should order the affirmance of the decision of
the trial court. Waters-PierceOil Co. v. Texas, 212 U. S.

Mr. Will R. King for defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the court.
This is a suit to quiet the title to an unsurveyed island
in the Snake River, a navigable stream, the, thread of
which at that place is the dividing line between the States
of Oregon and Idaho. The island lies between the main
channel and the bank on the Idaho side and is separated
from the latter by a lesser channel from 100 to 300 feet in.
width which carries a considerable part of the waters of
the'river, save when it is at its lower stages. The plaintiffs hold patents from the United States, issued in 1890
and 1892, for certain lots on the Idaho side opposite the
island and claim it under these patents,- while the defendant insists that it remains public land and that he
has a possessory right to it acquired by settling thereon
in 1894 and subsequently improving and cultivating it.

MOSS v. RAMEY.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The island contains about 120 acres, has banks rising
abruptly above the water, is of stable formation, has a
natural growth of grass and of trees suitable for firewood,
and evidently has been in its present condition since long
before the adjacent lands on the Idaho side were surveyed,
which was in 1868. The field notes and plat represented
the survey as extending to the river, but made no men-.
tion of the island. They also represented the lots or
fractional tracts immediately opposite the island as containing 110.40 acres. The patents under which the plaintiffs claim described the lots by giving the numbers assigned and the acreage accredited to them on the plat
and then saying "according to the. official plat of the survey of the said land returned to the General Land Office
by the Surveyor General." The trial court concluded that
the island remained unsurveyed public land and that the
plaintiffs' lands extended only to the river, and rendered
judgment against the plaintiffs. They appealed and the
Supreme Court of the State held, one member dissenting,
that the patents passed the title not only to the lots, as
shown on the plat, but also to all islands lying between
them and the thread of the stream. The judgment was
accordingly reversed and a new trial ordered to determine whether the plaintiffs had lost title to the island
through adverse possession. 14 Idaho, 598. Upon the
new trial judgment was given for the plaintiffs and the
defendant appealed. The Supreme Court, in deference
to our intermediate decision in Scott v. Lattig, 227 U. S.
229, then recalled its decision upon the first appeal,
reversed the judgment rendered upon the second trial
and remanded the cause with a direction to dismiss it.
25 Idaho, 1. The plaintiffs bring the case here.
While the inference naturally arising from the silence of
the field notes and plat is that the island was not there at
the time of the survey, or, if there, was a mere sand bar
or of inconsiderable area and value, what is shown and
VOL. ccxxxIx-35

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

conceded respecting its stable formation, elevation, size
and appearance, completely refutes this inference and
demonstrates that the island was in its present condition
at the time of the survey and when Idaho became a State,
which was twenty-two years later.
Thus the facts bearing on the status of the island and the
operation of the patents are essentially the same as in
Scott v. Lattig, and, in view of what was there held, it
suffices to say: The error of the surveyor in failing to
extend the survey over the island did not make it any the
less a part of the public domain. It wasfast dry land, and
neither a part of the bed of the river norqland under water,
and therefore did not pass to the State of Idaho on her
admission into the Union but remained public land as
before. The descriptive terms in the patents embraced
the lots abutting on the river, as shown on the plat, but
not this island lying between the lots and the thread of the
stream. Chapman & Dewey Lumber Co. v. St. Francis
Levee District, 232 U. S. 186; Gauthier v. Morrison, 232
U. S. 452; Producers Oil Co. v. Hanzen, 238 U. S. 325.
The claim that the island passed under the patents is
therefore ill founded. The case of Whitaker v. McBride,
197 U. S. 510, upon which the plaintiffs rely, is distinguishable in that what was there claimed to be an island
contained only 22 acres and was not shown to be of stable
formation, and the Land Department had repeatedly
refused to treat it as public land.
It is contended that the decision upon the first appeal
became the law of the case and that by recalling that
decision when considering the second appeal the court
infringed upon the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The contention must fail. There is
nothing in that or any other clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment which prevents a State from permitting an
appellate court to alter or correct its interlocutory decision
upon a first appeal when the same case with the same

MOSS v. RAMEY.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

parties comes before it again; and whether this is permitted
is a question of local law, upon which the decision of the
highest court of the State is- controlling here. King v.
West Virginia, 216 U. S. 92, 100; John v. Paullin, 231
U. S. 583.
It also is contended that under the due process of law
clause of such Amendment the court was not at liberty
upon the second appeal to change its first decision, because
after the case was remanded for a new trial the defendant
acquiesced in that decision by an amendment to his answer
completely eliminating from the case all controversy respecting the status of the island and the operation of the
patents. This contention is without any real basis in the
record. The original answer is not before us but the
amended one is, and it, in addition to otherwise traversing
the plaintiffs' allegation of ownership, expressly denies
that they or either of them "have any right, title or interest whatever in any portion" of the island. And examining the evidence taken on the second trial we find that the
defendant was then still insisting that the island was
public and not private land. It is idle therefore to claim
that the point involved in the first decision was completely eliminated from the case between the two appeals.
Whether, if the record were Otherwise, it could be said
that there was an abuse of due process need not be considered.
Judgment affirmed.
