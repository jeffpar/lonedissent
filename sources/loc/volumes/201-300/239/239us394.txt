Affirmed.

HADACHECK v. SEBASTIAN, CHIEF OF POLICE
OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
No. 32. Submitted October 22, 1915.-Decided December 20, 1915.
While the police power of the State cannot be so arbitrarily exercised
as to deprive persons of their property without due process of law
or deny them equal protection of the law, it is one of the most
essential powers of Government and one of the least limitable--in
fact, the imperative necessity for its existence precludes any limitation upon it when not arbitrarily exercised.
A vested interest cannot because of conditions once obtaining be
asserted against the proper exercise of the police power-to so hold
would preclude development. Chicago & Alton R. R. v. Tranbarger,
238 U. S. 67.
There must be progress, and in its march private interests must yield
to the good of the community.
The police power may be exerted under some conditions to declare
that under particular circumstances and in particular localities
specified businesses which are not nuisances per se (such as livery
stables, as in Reinman v. Little Rock, 237 U. S. 171, and brick yards,
as in this case) are to be deemed nuisances in fact and law.
While an ordinance prohibiting the manufacturing of bricks within a
specified section of a municipality may be a constitutional exercise
of the police power--quere whether prohibiting of digging the clay
and moving it from that section would not amount to an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law.
This court cannot consider the contention of one attacking a municipal
ordinance that it denies him equal protection of the laws when based
upon disputable considerations of classification and on a comparison

HADACHECK v. LOS ANGELES.
239 U. S.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

of conditions of which there is no means o' judicial determination.
In this case, the charges of plaintiff in error that the ordinance attacked and alleged to be ruining his business was adopted in order to
foster a monopoly and suppress his competition with others in the
same business, is too illusive for this court to consider, the state
courts having also refuted it.
The fact that'a particular business is not prohibited in all sections of a
,municipality, does not for that reason, make the ordinance untonstitutional as denying equal protection of the law to those carrying
on that business in the prohibited section-conditions may justify
the distinction and classification.
In determining whether a municipal ordinance goes further than necessary to remedy the evil to be cured, this court must, in the absence
of clear showing to the contrary, accord good faith to the municipality.
Whether an ordinance is within the charter power of the city or valid
under the state constitution are questions of state law.
An ordinance of Los Angeles prohibiting the manufacturing of bricks
within specified limits of the city, held, in an action brought by the
owner of brick clay deposits and a brick factory, not to be unconstitutional as depriving him of his property without due process of
law, or as denying him equal protection of the laws.
165 California, 416, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the constitutionality under
the due process and equal protection provisions of the
Fourteenth Amendment of an ordinance of Los Angeles
prohibiting brick yards within certain limits of the city,.
are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Emmett H. Wilson and Mr. G. C. DeGarmo for
plaintiff in error:
Although an ordinance is purported to have been
enacted to protect the public health, morals or safety if it
has no substantial relation to those objects, constitutional
rights have been invaded and it is the duty of the court so
to adjudge. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356; Lochner v.
New York, 198 U. S. 45; Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133.
The State, or any political subdivision thereof, when

legislating for the protection of the public health, the
public morals, or the public safety, is subject to the paramount authority of Federal Constitution of the United
States, and is not permitted to violate rights secured or
guaranteed thereby. Henderson v. Wickham, 92 U. S.
259; Hannibal Co. v. Husen, 95 U. S. 465; New Orleans
Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 U. S. 650; Walling v.
Michigan, 116 U. S. 446; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.
356.
The business of operating brick yards and manufacturing brick is a useful, necessary and lawful occupation and
is not a nuisance per se. Huckenstine's Appeal, 70 Pa. St.
102; State v. Board of Health, 16 Mo. App. 8; Phillips v.
Lawrence V. B. & T. Co., 72 Kansas, 643; Denver v.
Rogers, 46 Colorado, 479; Windfall Mfg. Co. v. Patterson,
148 Indiana, 414; Belmont v. New England Brick Co., 190
Massachusetts, 442.
A city cannot prohibit the maintenance of a brick yard
unless, by reason of the manner of its operation, it becomes a nuisance in fact. Yates v. Milwaukee, .10 Wall.
497; Everett v. Council Bluffs, 46 Iowa, 66; Ex parte Sing
Lee, 96 California, 354; In re Sam Kee, 31 Fed. Rep. 680;

Denver v. Rogers, 46 Colorado, 479; Denver v. Mullin, 7
Colorado, 345; Phillips v. Denver, 19 Colorado, 179, 184.
A city council is not empowered to pass an. ordinance
making that a nuisance which is not a nuisance per se.
The legislative declaration cannot alter the character of a
business so as to make a nuisance of that which is not
such in fact. Nor will the mere legislative declaration of
the existence of a nuisance be accepted as a fact by the
courts. Cases supra and Los Angeles v. Hollywood Cemetery, 124 California, 344; Grossman v. Oakland, 30 Oregon,
478.
The power possessed by the city to abate nuisances does

not include power to prevent unless the business is a nuisance per se. Lake View v. Letz, 44 Illinois, 81; In re
Smith, 143 California, 371; Hume v. Laurel Hill Cemetery,

California, 611; Covington & L. P. R. Co. v. Sandford, 164
U. S. 578, 592; Ruhstratv. People, 185 Illinois, 133.
In cases of this kind the court must scrutinize the objects and purposes sought to be accomplished by the
ordinance in question for the purpose of determining its
validity. In so doing they are not limited to matters
that appear upon the face of the ordinance, but may consider all the circumstances in the light of existing conditions. Cases supra and Lake View v. Tate, 130 Illinois,
247; Ex parte Patterson,42 Tex. Crim. Rep. 256; People v.
Armstrong, 73 Michigan, 288; Oxanna v. Allen, 90 Alabama, 468; Tugman v. Chicago, 78 Illinois, 405; Cleveland

Mississippi, 493; Corregan v. Gage, 68 Missouri, 541;
Chicago v. Rumpf, 45 Illinois, 90.
The exercise of the police power cannot be made a mere
cloak for the arbitrary interference with or the suppression
of a lawful business, cases supra, nor can discriminatory
legislation be sustained even though enacted under color
of sanitary power. Freund, Police Power, § 138.
A law is not general or constitutional if it imposes

The ordinance in question deprives the plaintiff in

therefore void. Frorerv. People, 141 Illinois, 171; Ramsey

166 U. S. 224; Chicago v. Netcher, 183 Illinois, 104; Braceville Coal Co. v. People, 147 Illinois, 66.
In order to sustain the validity of a municipal ordinance
it is necessary for the court to determine that its provisions are reasonable. Chicago v. Rumpf, 45 Illinois, 90.;
Toledo W. & W. Ry. v. Jacksonville, 07 Illinois, 37; Tugman v. Chicago, 78 Illinois, 405; Lake View v. Tate, 130
Illinois, 247; Oxanna v. Allen, 90 Alabama, 468.
The ordinance is unreasonable because the severe
measures adopted were not reasonably necessary for the
preventibn of the acts complained of in reference to the
brickyard. Remedies other than confiscation of the
property would have been' effective. Oases supra and
Judson v. Los Angelei Suburban Gas Co., 157 California,
168.
The ordinance is unreasonable because if any nuisance
has existed the same may be al1ated by regulatory rather

than by suppressive and confiscatory measures. The
business should be allowed to continue upon eliminating
such features, if any, as constituted a nuisance. Cases

Supp. 275; Yocum v. Hotel St. George, 18 Abb. N. C.
(N. Y.) 340; Miller v. Webster, 94 Iowa, 162.
The ordinance is unreasonable because it is not limited
with reference to conditions and measures. The danger
may be slight and remote while the remedy-entire
suppression-could not be more drastic. Cases supra and
Freund, Police Povjer, § 143.
The ordinance is unreasonable because the means
adopted are out of proportion to the danger involved. The
restraint should not be disproportionate to the danger.
Cases supra and Freund, Police Power, §§ 150, 158.
The ordinance is unreasonable because the law will not
take cognizance of petty inconveniences and slight grievances. Cases supra and Freund, Police Power, § 178;

the proper power, to determine when such regulations are
essential, and its determination in this regard, in view
of its better knowledge of all the circumstances and of the
presumption that it is acting With a due regard for the
rights of all parties, will not be disturbed in the courts
unless it can plainly be seen that the regulation has no
relation to the ends above stated, but is a clear invasion
of personal or property rights under the guise of police
regulation. Cases supra and Krittenbrinkv. Withnell, 135

MR. JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the
court.
Habeas corpus prosecuted in the Supreme Court of the
State of California for the discharge of plaintiff in error
from the custody of defendant in error, Chief of Police of
the City of Los Angeles.
Plaintiff in error, to whom we shall refer as petitioner,
was convicted of a misdemeanor for the violation of an
ordinance of the City of Los Angeles which makes it unlawful for any person to establish or operate a brick yard
or brick kiln, or any establishment, factory or place for
the manufacture or burning of brick within described
limits in the city. Sentence was pronounced against him

HADACHECK v. LOS ANGELES.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and he was committed to the custody of defendant in
error as Chief of Police of the City of Los Angeles.
Being so in custody he filed a petition in the Supreme
Court of the State for a writ of habeas corpus. The writ
was issued. Subsequently defendant in error made a return thereto supported by affidavits, to which petitioner
made sworn reply. The cour't rendered judgment discharging the writ and remanding petitioner to custody.
The Chief Justice of the court then granted this writ of
error.
The petition sets forth the reason for resorting to habeas
corpus and that petitioner is the owner of a tract of land
within the limits described in the ordinance upon which
tract of land there is a very valuable bed of clay, of great
value for the manufacture of brick of a fine quality, worth
to him not less than $100,000 per acre or about $800,000
for the entire tract for brick-making purposes, and not
exceeding $60,000 for residential purposes or for any purpose other than the manufacture of brick. That he has
made excavations of considerable depth and covering a
very large area of the property and that on account
thereof the land cannot be utilized for residential purposes
or any purpose other than that for which it is now used.
That he purchased the land because of such bed of clay
and for the purpose of manufacturing brick; that it was at
the time of purchase outside of the limits of the city and
distant from dwellings and other habitations and that he
did not expect or believe, nor did other owners of property
in the vicinity expect or believe, that the territory would
be annexed to the city. That he has erected expensive
machinery for the manufacture of bricks of fine quality
which have been and are being used for building purposes
in and about the city.
That if the ordinance be declared valid he will be compelled to entirely abandon his business and will be deprived
of the use of his property.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

That the manufacture of brick must necessarily be
carried on where. suitable clay is found and the clay cannot
be transported to some other location, and, besides, the
clay upon his property is particularly fine and clay of as
good quality cannot be found in any other place within
the city where the same can be utilized for the manufacture
of brick. That within the prohibited district there is one
other brick yard besides that of plaintiff in error.
That there is no reason for the prohibition of the business-; that its maintenance cannot be and is not in the
nature of a nuisance as defined in § 3479 of the Civil Code
of the State, and cannot be dangerous or detrimental to
health or the morals or safety or peace or welfare or convenience of the people of the district or city.
That the business is so conducted as not to be in any
way or degree a nuisance; no noises arise therefrom, and no
noxious odors, and that by the use of certain means (which
are described) provided and the situation of the brick yard
an extremely small amount of smoke is emitted from any
kiln and what is emitted is so dissipated that it is not a
nuisance nor in any manner detrimental to health or comfort. That during the seven years which the brick yard
has been conducted no comllaint has been made of it, and
no attempt has ever been made to regulate it.
That the city embraces 107.62 square miles in area and
75% of it is devoted to residential purposes; that the district described in the ordinance includes only about three
square miles, is sparsely settled and contains large tracts
of unsubdivided and unoccupied land: and that the boundaries of the district were determined for the sole and
specific purpose of prohibiting and suppressing the business of petitioner and that of the other brick yard.
That there are and were at the time of the adoption of
the ordinance in other districts of the city thickly built up
with residences brick yards maintained more detrimental

signed by several hundred persons, representing such brick
yards to be a nuisance and no ordinance or regulation was
passed in regard to such petition and the brick yards are
operated without hindrance or molestation. That other
brick yards are permitted to be maintained without prohibition or regulation.
That no ordinance or regulation of any kind has been
passed at any time regulating or attempting to regulate brick yards or inquiry made whether they could be
maintained without being a nuisance or detrimental to
health.
That the ordinance does not state a public offense and
is in violation of the constitution of the State and the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
States.
That the business of petitioner is a lawful one, none of
the materials used in it are combustible, the machinery is
of the most approved pattern and its conduct will not
create a nuisance.
There is an allegation that the ordinance if enforced
fosters and will foster a monopoly and protects and will
protect other persons engaged in the manufacture of brick
in the city, and discriminates and will discriminate against
petitioner in favor of such other persons who are his competitors, and will prevent him from entering into competition with them.
The petition, after almost every paragraph, charges a
deprivation of property, the taking of property without
compensation, and that the ordinance is in consequence
invalid.
We have given this outline of the petition as it presents
petitioner's contentions, with the circumstances (which we
deem most material) that give color and emphasis to them.
But there are substantial traverses made by the return
to the writ, among others, a denial of the charge that the
ordinance was arbitrarily directed against the business of

petitioner, and it is alleged that there is another district
in which brick yards are prohibited.
There was a denial of the allegations that the brick yard
was conducted or could be conducted sanitarily or was not
offensive to health. And there were affidavits supporting
the denials. In these it was alleged that the fumes, gases,
smoke, soot, steam and dust arising from petitioner's
brick-making plant have from time to time caused sickness
and serious discomfort to those living in the vicinity.
There was no specific denial of the value of the property
or that it contained deposits of clay or that the latter could
not be removed and manufactured into brick elsewhere.
There was, however, a general denial that the enforcement
of the ordinance would "entirely deprive petitioner of his
property and the use thereof."
How the Supreme Court dealt with the*allegations,
denials and affidavits we can gather from its opinion.
The court said, through Mr. Justice Sloss, 165 California,
p. 416: "The district to which the prohibition was applied
contains about three square miles. The petitioner is the
owner of a tract of' land, containing eight acres, more or
less, within the district described in the ordinance. He
acquired his land in 1902, before the territory to which
the ordinance was directed had been annexed to the city
of Los Angeles. His land contains valuable deposits of
clay suitable for the manufacture of brick, and he has,
during the entire period of his ownership, used the land
for brickmaking, and has erected thereon kilns, machinery
and buildings necessary for such manufacture. The land,
as he alleges, is far more valuable for brickmaking than for
any other purpose."
The court considered the business one which could be
regulated and that regulation was not precluded by the
fact "that the value of investments made in the business
prior to any legislative action will be greatly diminished,"
and that no complaint could be based upon the fact that

petitioner had been carrying on the trade in that locality
for a long period.
And, considering the allegations of the petition, the
denials of the return and the evidence of the affidavits, the
court said that the latter tended to show that the district
created had become primarily a residential section and
that the occupants of the neighboring dwellings are seriously incommoded by the operations of petitioner; and
that such evidence, "when taken in connection with the
presumptions in favor of the propriety of the legislative
determination, overcame the contention that the prohibition of the ordinance was a mere arbitrary invasion of
private right, not supported by any tenable belief that the
continuance of the business was so detrimental to the interests of others as to require suppression."
The court, on the evidence, rejected the contention that
the ordinance was not in good faith enacted as a police
measure and that it was intended to discriminate against
petitioner or that it was actuated by any motive of injuring
him as an individual.
The charge of discrimination between localities was
not sustained. The court expressed the view that the
determination of prohibition was for the legislature and
that the court, without regard to the fact shown in the
return that there was another district in which brickmaking was prohibited, could not sustain the claim that
the ordinance was not enacted in good faith but was
designed to discriminate against petitioner and the other
brick yard within the district. "The facts before us,"
the court finally said, "would certainly nQt justify the
conclusion that the ordinance here in question was designed, in either its adoption or its enforcement, to be anything but what it purported to be, viz., a legitimate regulation, operating alike upon all who came within its terms."
We think the conclusion of the court is justified by the
evidence and makes it unnecessary to review the many

cases cited by petitioner -in which it is decided that the
police power of a state cannot be arbitrarily exercised.
The principle is familiar, but in any given case it must
plainly appear to apply. It is to be remembered that we
are dealing with one of the most essential powers of government, one that is the least limitable. It may, indeed, seem
harsh in its exercise, usually is on some individual, but
the imperative necessity for its existence precludes any
limitation upon it when not exerted arbitrarily... A vested
interest cannot be asserted against it because of conditions
once obtaining. Chicago & Alton R. R. v. Tranbarger,238
U. S. 67, 78. To so hold would preclude development and
fix a city forever in its primitive conditions. There must
be progress, and if in its march private interests are in
the way they must yield to the good of the community.
The logical result of petitioner's contention would seem
to be that a city could not be formed or enlarged against
the resistance of an occupant of the ground and that if it
grows at all it can only grow as the environment of the
occupations that are usually banished to the purlieus.
The police power' and to what extent it may be exerted
we have recently illustrated in Reinman v. Little. Rock,
237 U. S. 171. The circumstances of the case were very
much like those of the case at bar and give reply to the
contentions of petitioner, especially that which asserts
that a necessary and lawful occupation that is not a
nuisance per se cannot be made so by legislative declaration. There was a like investment in property, encouraged by the then conditions; a like reduction of value and
depri'Vation of property was asserted against the validity
of the ordinance there considered; a like assertion of an
arbitrary exercise of the power of prohibition. Against
all of these contentions, and causing the rejection of them
all, was adduced the police power. There was a prohibition of a business, lawful in itself, there as here. It was
a livery stable there; a brick yard here. They differ in

HADACHECK v. LOS ANGELES.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

particulars, but they are alike in that which cause and
justify prohibition in defined localities-that is, the effect
upon the health and comfort of the community.
The ordinance passed upon prohibited the conduct of
the business within a certain defined area in Little Rock,
Arkansas. This court said of it: granting that the business was not a nuisance per se, it was clearly within the
police power of the State to regulate it, "and to that end
to declare that in particular circumstances and in particular localities a livery stable shall be deemed a nuisance
in fact and in law." And the only limitation upon the
power was stated to be that the power could not be
exerted arbitrarily or with unjust discrimination. There
was a citation of cases. We think the present case is
within the ruling thus declared.
There is a distinction between Reinman v. Little Rock
and the case at bar. There a particular business was prohibited which was not affixed to or dependent upon its
locality; it could be conducted elsewhere. Here, it is
contended, the latter condition does not exist, and it is
alleged that the manufacture of brick must necessarily be
carried on where suitable clay is found and that the clay
on petitioner's property cannot be transported to some
other locality. This is not urged as a physical impossibility but only, counsel say, that such transportation and
the transportation of the bricks to places where they
could be used in construction work would be prohibitive
"from a financial standpoint." But upon the evidence
the Supreme Court considered the case, as we understand
its opinion, from the standpoint of the offensive effects
of the operation of a brick yard and not from the deprivation of the deposits of clay, and distinguished Ex parte
Kelso, 147 California, 609, wherein the court declared
invalid an ordinance absolutely prohibiting the maintenance or operation of a rock or stone quarry within a
certain portion of the city and county of San Francisco.

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

The court there said that the effect of the ordinance was
"to absolutely deprive the owners of real property within
such limits of a valuable right incident to their ownership,-viz., the right to extract therefrom such rock and
stone as they might find it to their advantage to dispose
of.". The court expressed the view that the removal
could be regulated but that "an absolute prohibition of
such removal under the circumstances," could not be upheld.
In the present case there is no prohibition of the removal of the brick clay; only a prohibition within the
designated locality of its manufacture into bricks. And
to this feature of the ordinance our opinion is addressed.
Whether other questions would arise if the ordinance
were broader, and opinion on such questions, we reserve.
Petitioner invokes the equal protection clause of the
Constitution and charges that it is. violated in that the
ordinance (1) "prohibits him from manufacturing brick
upon his property while his competitors are permitted,
without regulation of any kind, to manufacture brick
upon property situated in all respects similarly to that of
plaintiff in error'-; and (2). that it "prohibits the conduct
of his business while it permits the maintenance within
the same district of any other kind of business, no matter
how objectionable the same may be, either in its nature or
in the manner in which it is conducted."
If we should grant that the first specification shows a
violation of classification, that is, a distinction between
businesses which was not within the legislative power,
petitioner's contention encounters the objection that it
depends upon an inquiry of fact which the record does
not enable us to determine. It is alleged in the return to
the petition that brickmaking is prohibited in one other
district and an ordinance is referred to regulating business
in other districts. To this plaintiff in error replied that
the ordinance attempts to prohibit the operation of certain

HADACHECK v. LOS ANGELES.
239 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

businesses having mechanical power and does not prohibit
the maintenance of any business or the operation of any
machine that is operated by animal power. In other
words, petitioner makes his contention depend upon
disputable considerations of classification and upon a
comparison of conditions of which there is no means of
judicial determination and upon which nevertheless we
are expected to reverse legislative action exercised upon
matters of which the city has control.
To a certain extent the latter comment may be applied
to other contentions, and, besides, there is no allegation or
proof of other objectionable businesses being permitted
within the district, and a speculatiom of their establishment or conduct at some future time is too remote.
In his petition and argument something is made of the
ordinance as fostering a monopoly and suppressing his
competition with other brickmakers. The charge and
argument are too illusive. It is part of the charge that
the ordinance was directed against him. The charge, we
have seen, was rejected by the Supreme Court, and we
find nothing to justify it.
It may be that brick yards in other localities within the
city where the same conditions exist are not regulated or
prohibited, but it does not follow that they will not be.
That petitioner's business was first in time to be prohibited does not make its prohibition unlawful. And it
may be, as said by the Supreme Court of the State, that
the conditions justify a distinction. However, the inquiries thus suggested are outside of our province.
There are other and subsidiary contentions which, we
think, do not require discussion. They are disposed of by
what we have said. It may be that something else than
prohibition would have satisfied the conditions. Of this,
however, we have no means of determining, and besides
we cannot declare invalid the exertion of a power which
the city undoubtedly has because of a charge that it does

not exactly accommodate the conditions or that some
other exercise would have been better or less harsh. We
must accord good faith to the city in the absence of a
clear showing to the contrary and an honest exercise of

judgment upon the circumstances which induced its
action.

We do not notice the contention that the ordinance is
not within the city's charter powers nor that it is in violation of the state constitution, such contentions raising
only local questions which must be deemed to have been
decided adversely to petitioner by the Supreme Court of
the State.
