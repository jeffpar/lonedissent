UNITED STATES FIDELITY AND GUARANTY
COMPANY v. RIEFLER.
CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT.
No. 11. Argued October 27, 1915.-Decided November 1, 1915.
An instrument agreeing to indemnify a bond company for giving an

official bond, signed and sealed and delivered to the officer to be
bonded with authority to deliver it to the bonding company, and
which was so delivered and was relied upon by the bonding company in issuing its bond, held, in this case, to have been a completed contract on the delivery thereof to the bonding company
which was not required to notify the parties thereto of its acceptance.

THE facts, which involve the liability of defendants on
a bond of indemnity to a surety company, are stated in
the opinion.
Mr. A. F. Reichmann, with whom Mr. Noble B. Judah,
Mr. Monroe L. Willard, Mr. Henry M. Wolf and Mr.
Arthur M. Cox were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:
The instrument sued on in this case is a bond of indemnity and not a contract of guaranty. There is a
generic as well as a historic distinction between bonds of
indemnity and contracts of guaranty. 14 Am. & Eng.

A guarantee must ordinarily exhaust his remedies
against the person primarily liable before resorting to his
guarantor. Blut an indemnitee can hold his indemnitor
without first seeking reimbursement from any third
person. Pingrey on Suretyship, ยง 360; Page v. White

An indemnitee must have actually paid a judgment or
given his own obligation to the creditor which has been
accepted as payment before he can maintain an action
upon the instrument of indemnity; while a guarantee may
maintain an action against a guarantor to compel payment
of the debt itself. Central Trust Co. v. Louisville Trust

While a guarantor's undertaking is for the benefit of
the creditor, the undertaking of a surety's indemnitor is
not. The creditor cannot maintain any action upon it.

As a general rule an indemnitor is neither a guarantor
nor a surety. He is a principal, although he is frequently
referred to by the courts as a surety. Wise v. Miller, 45
Oh. St. 388; Appleton v. Bascom, 3 Metc. 169.
Historically, contracts of indemnity are creations of
the common law, and are usually specialties (except the
implied obligation created by law on the part of a principal
to indemnify his surety when no express obligation has
been given); while contracts of guaranty are commercial
contracts having their origin in the rules of the law merchant and are usually simple contracts. Courtis v. Dennis,

Instruments of guaranty (unlike instrument of indemnity) are divided into two classes, (a) overtures or
offers to guaranty (to which class belongs Davis Sewing
Machine Co. V. Richards), and (b) absolute guaranties (to
which class belongs Davis v. Wells). Pitman on Principal

Mutuality of assent is essential to every dontract and

never became a binding obligation, regardless of the question as to whether it was in form an instrument of guaranty

Curry v. Colburn, 99 Wisconsin, 319.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.
The facts certified are simple. One Dooling, being
required to give, an official bond, applied in Springfield,
Illinois, to an agent of the plaintiff in error, a bondiiig
company having its home office in Baltimore, Maryland,
was informed that the Company would become his surety
only on condition that he- furnish indemnity, and was
handed a printed form of indemnity bond. The defendants
in error at Dooling's request sIgned and sealed this bond
for the purposes therein expressed and authorized Dooling
to deliver it to the Company through its Springfield
agent, which Dooling did. The, agent, who is not shown
to have had authority to execu te bonds, forwarded it for
acceptance. The Company relying upon it became
surety for Dooling. One of the recitals of the bond was
that the Company "has become or is about to become
surety, at the request of the said Frank E. Dooling, on a
certain bond in the sum of Five Thousand Two Hundred
Dollars, wherein Frank E. Dboling is principal, as Recorder of Springfield District Court No. 25, Court of
Honor, located at Springfield, Illinois, a copy of which
bond is hereto attached No. 52012-5, which bond is made
a part. hereof." The condition was that Dooling should
keep the Company indemnified for all loss by reason of
its suretyship. A copy of the Company's bond, was not
attached and at the date of the indemnity bond had not
been executed. Dooling was not a party to the indemnity bond. The defendants in error received no pecuniary consideration for their act and were not -notified of
the acceptance of their bond or of the execution of the
other by the Company. The .questions propounded are:

OCTOBER TERM, 1915.
Opinion of the Court.

239 U. S.

"(1) Was the instrument which was signed by Riefler
and Hall, and relied on by the Company, a completed
contract of indemnity or guaranty? (2) Or was it merely
an offer to become indemnitors or guarantors, requiring
notice of acceptance by the Company in accordance with
Davis v. Wells, 104 U. S. 159, and Davis Sewing Machine
Co. v. Richards, 115 U. S. 524? (3) And, if in substance
the instrument was merely an offer, does the fact that it
was in the form of a bond under seal take it out of the rule
of those authorities?"
If the bond in suit had been delivered directly to the
Company and had been pronounced satisfactory there
would have been no need to notify Riefler and Hall of the
Company's subsequently executing the Dooling bond.
Riefler and Hall assumed an obligation in present words
to indemnify the Company against an exactly identified
suretyship that the Company had gone or was about to
go into, as they stated. The Company was about to go
into it and went into it. If Riefler and Hall had made
only a parol offer in the same terms, the Company by becoming surety would have furnished the consideration that
would have converted the offer into a contract, but notice
is held necessary in Davis Sewing Machine Co. v. Richards. If it had been a covenant the Company's act would
have satisfied the condition upon which the covenant applied. O'Brien v. Boland, 166 Massachusetts, 481, 483.
As it was a bond, the Company's entering into its undertaking in like manner furnished the subject-matter to
which the obligation by its terms .applied, In the case of
either covenant or bond there was no need for notice that
an event had happened that the defendants' contract
contemplated as sure to happen, if it had not already
come to pass.
The only ground for hesitation is that seemingly the
bond in suit might have been rejected by the Company
as unsatisfactory, and that therefore it may be argued

UNITFD STATES FIDELITY CO. v. RIEFLER. 25

Opinion of the Court.

that Riefler and Hall were entitled to notice that it had
been accepted. But we are of opinion that in the circum-

stances of this case it is reasonable to understand that
they took the risk. They were chargeable with notie that'
by their act their bond had come to the hands of the
Company. The bond on its face contemplated that the
Company would accept it and act upon it at once, and
disclosed the precise extent of the obligation assumed.
It seems to us that when such a bond, carrying, as a specialty does, its complete obligation with the paper, is.put
by the obligors into the hands of the obligee and in fact is
accepted by it, notice is not necessary that a condition
subsequent to the delivery by which the obligee might
have made it ineffectual has not been fulfilled. The contract is complete without the notice, Butler & Baker'8
Case, 3 Co. Rep. 25, 26b; Xenos v. Wickham, L. R. 2

H. L. 296; Pollock, Contracts, 8th ed., 7, 8, and we see
no commercial reason why the principles ordinarily governing contracts under seal should not be applied. Bird v.
Washburn, 10 Pick. 223. In Davis v. Wells, supra, the
guaranty was an open continuing one up to $10,000, but
it was under seal and was held binding, although additional
reasons were advanced.
We answer the first question: Yes.
