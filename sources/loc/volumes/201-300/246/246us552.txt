UNITED STATES v. WHITED & WHELESS,
LIMITED, ET AL.
EROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.
No. 204.

Submitted March 19, 1918.--Decided April 15, 1918.

The provision in the Act of March 3, 1891, § 8, 26 Stat. 1099, that
"suits by the United States to vacate and annul patents hereafter
issued shall only be brought within six years after the date of the
issuance of such patents," was designed for the security of patent
titles and does not apply to an action at law to recover the value of
patented land as damages for deceit practiced by the defendant in
procuring the patent.
A statute of limitations should be strictly construed in favor of the
Government.
Where there are two remedies for the protection of the same right,
one may be barred and the other not.
The provision in the Act of March 2, 1896, limiting the Government's
money recovery to the minimum government price (see 29 Stat.
42, § 2), when patents have been "erroneously issued under a railroad or wagon road grant" and the lands have been sold to bona
fide purchasers, does not apply to a case in which the Government
seeks money damages because of deceit practiced in procuring a patent under the Homestead Law.
232 Fed. Rep. 139, reversed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Kearful for the United
States:
In the absence of limitation the Government may sue
either to annul the patent or to recover the value of the
land. The authority of the Attorney General to make
this election of remedies results from his general authority
to sue in behalf of the United States upon all just grounds
that are available to private individuals. United States
v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125 U. S. 273, 279.

UNITED STATES v. WHITED & WHELESS.

553

Argument for the United States.

A demonstration of the availability of both these remedies to the Government is found in the fact that where
one of them can not be enforced without injury to third
parties resort may be had to the other--that is, where
the land has passed to an innocent purchaser its value
may still be recovered. Southern Pacific Co. v. United
States, 200 U. S.341, 352. To the same effect axe Cooper
v. United States, 220 Fed. Rep. 867, 870; United States v.
Koleno, 226 Fed. Rep. 180, 182; United States v. Frick,
244 Fed. Rep. 574, 580; Bistline v. United States, 229 Fed.
Rep. 546, 548. The doctrine of these cases is that the
right of the Government to sue for the value of the land
embraced in a fraudulent patent is not dependent upon
but exists independently of the right to sue for annulment of the patent.
The right to recover the value of the land is not affected
by the limitation act. There is nothing in the language
to indicate an intention to do more than to bar the right
to recover the land. To extend it by ordinary implication beyond its plain import would be to disregard the
settled rule that the United States "are not bound by
any statute of limitations, unless Congress has clearly
manifested its intention that they should be so bound."
United States v. Nashville &c. Ry. Co., 118 U. S. 120,
125; United States v. Insley, 130 U. S. 263, 265-266;
United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 159 U. S.
548, 554. Examples of restrictive interpretation of this
statute are not lacking. Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v.
United States, 227 U. S. 355, 367; La Roque v. United
States, 239 U. S. 62, 68; Louisiana v. Garfield, 211 U. S.
70, 77.
The situation which called for this statute discloses
its singleness of purpose. The Act of March 3, 1887, 24
Stat. 556, for the adjustment of land grants, resulted in
a large number of suits to cancel patents which had been
erroneously issued. This produced a general feeling of

uncertainty respecting the stability of titles to public
lands and tended to cast discredit on all public land patents. It was to settle such titles and restore the public
faith in patents of the United States that the limitation
clause was inserted in the Act of 1891. See House Report
253, 54th Cong., 1st sess. The language of the act is well
adapted to accomplish that result, and that result can
be fully accomplished without in any manner affecting
the right to sue for the value of land procured by fraud.
By appropriate language to meet a different situation
Congress might have barred both classes of suits; and
this it has done in a specific instance with respect to
certain lieu land patents. Act of March 2, 1896, 29 Stat.
42. This is an indication of the understanding of Congress that in order to bar the right to recover the value
of land procured by fraud or mistake it is not enough to
bar the right to recover the land.
In the confirmation by limitation act of fraudulent
patents for the single purpose of settling land titles there
is nothing inconsistent with the recognition of continued
right to redress on account of the fraud.
A private owner who has been defrauded of his property may, within the limitation period, elect to confirm
the transaction and recover the value. He does the same
thing in effect when he delays action beyond the time
limited by law for recovery of the property, if at that time
his right to recover the value be not also barred. In that
event, though the title be confirmed, the value may still
be recovered. Lamb v. Clark, 5 Pick. 193, 198; Kirkman
v. Philips' Heirs, 7 Heisk. 222, 224; Ivey's Admr. v.
Owens, 28 Alabama, 641, 649; Ganley v. Troy City National Bank, 98 N. Y. 487, 494; Robertson v. Dunn, 87
N. Car. 191, 194; Campbell v. Holt, 115 U. S. 620, 625;
Hardinv. Boyd, 113 U. S. 756, 765.
The right of the Government to relief against fraud by
every appropriate remedy is not less than that of the

individual. United States v. San Jacinto Tin Co., 125
U. S. 273, 279. In a case of fraud, it is entitled to "all
the remedy which the courts can give"; United States v.
Minor, 114 U. S. 233, 241; including election between
different remedies; Fenemore v. United States, 3 Dail.
357, 363; and the pursuit of one after another is no longer
available. Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, 200 U. S.
341, 352.
All of the lower federal courts which have had to consider this question, except in the present case, have sustained the right of the Government to sue for the value
of land obtained by fraud, after the land itself has been
put beyond recovery by the limitation statute. United
States v. Jones, 218 Fed. Rep. 973-975; s. c., 242 Fed.
Rep. 609, 616; United States v. Pitan,224 Fed. Rep. 604,
609, 610; s. c., 241 Fed. Rep. 364, 366; United States v.

States, 229 Fed. Rep. 546, 548; Union Coal & Coke Co. v.
United States, 247 Fed. Rep. 106. It is evident that the
decision of the Court of Appeals in this case was founded
entirely upon an expression of this court in the case of
United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 209 U. S. 447, 450,a case readily distinguishable.
The measure of value is not the minimum government
price. The offer of the Government to accept $1.25
per acre under the conditions specified in the Homestead
Act has no reference to actual value. The conditions
themselves imply that the land is much more valuable
than the price so fixed. Pitan v. United States, 241 Fed.
Rep. 364, 366; United States v. Trinidad Coal Co., 137
U. S. 160, 170. The Act of March 2, 1896, § 2, relates
only to cases where patents were "erroneously issued
under a railroad or wagon road grant." Pitan Case, supra;
United States v. Frick, 244 Fed. Rep. 574, 580. To the
same effect are Cooper v. United States, 220 Fed. Rep. 867,

Argument for Defendants in Error.

246 U. S.

Mr. T. Alexander, Mr. A. L. Alexander and Mr. J. D.
Wilkinson for defendants in error:
In an action by the United States to recover the value
of land, which it alleges was fraudulently procured under
a patent at the price of $1.25 per acre, no cause of action
or right to recover is disclosed, for the reason that the
price received was the price at which it was willing to
sell the land and, therefore, it suffered no injury, even
conceding the fraud or misrepresentation as alleged to
be true. Act of March 2, 1896, §§ 2, 3, 29 Stat. 42; United
States v. Norris, 222 Fed. Rep. 14; Uniied States v. Pitan,
224 Fed. Rep. 604; United States v. Oregon & C. R. Co.,

States, 133 Fed. Rep. 662; s. c., 200 U. S. 354; Same v.
Same, 186 Fed. Rep. 737; Rev. Stats., § 2357.
Injury or damage to plaintiff as a result of fraudulent
representation is a necessary prerequisite of recovery in
an action for deceit. Stratton's Independence v. Dines,
135 Fed. Rep. 449; Srader v. Srader, 151 Indiana, 339;
Emerson v. Brigham, 10 Massachusetts, 199; Freeman v.
Venner, 120 Massachusetts, 424; Thompson v. Newell, 118
Mo. App. 405.
Suits by the United States to vacate and annul any
patent hereafter issued shall only be brought within six
years after the date of such patent. Act of March 3,
1891, 26 Stat. 1095.
Statutes of limitation are founded upon the general
experience of mankind that claims which axe valid are
not usually allowed to remain neglected. These statutes
by the lapse of time become laws of repose protecting
parties from prosecution of stale claims, when by the loss
of evidence from death of some witnesses and the imperfect recollection of others, or the destruction of documents, it might be impossible to establish the truth.

Argument of amicus curie.

Statutes of limitation, with regard to land at least, are
generally held to affect the right, even if in terms only
directed against the remedy. United States v. ChandlerDunbar Co., 152 Fed. Rep. 25; Sharon v. Tucker, 144
U. S. 533; Davis v. Mills, 194 U. S. 451.
The Act of 1891, as construed by most of the inferior
federal courts, bars a recovery of the price of land after
the lapse of six years, where the patent was obtained by
fraud. Kansas City Lumber Co. v. Moores, 212 Fed. Rep.
153; United States v. Exploration Co., 190 Fed. Rep. 405;
United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 152 Fed. Rep. 25;
United States v. Smith, 181 Fed. Rep. 545; United States
v. Norris, 222 Fed. Rep. 14; United States v. Whited &
Wheless, 232 Fed. Rep. 139.
This court has in effect held that this statute is a complete bar to any suit of any nature prosecuted after the
lapse of such time, for the value of the land or cancellation of the patent. United States v. Winona R. R. Co., 165
-U. S. 463; United States v. Chandler-DunbarCo., 209 U. S.
447.
Where a patent is obtained by fraud, the United States
has one cause of action with two remedies to enforce it.
When its cause of action is barred by the statute of
limitation of 1891, both of its remedies are barred and it
cannot resort to either. Brasie v. Minneapolis Brewing
Co., 87 Minnesota, 456; People v. Michigan Central Ry.
Co., 145 Michigan, 140; Auditor v. Halbert, 78 Kentucky,
577; Jex v. City of New York, 13 N. Y. St. Rep. 545;

246 U. S.

long as it remains uncanceled there is a conclusive presumption that the laws under which it was issued were
complied with and that the patentee was lawfully entitled thereto. It cannot be collaterally attacked. Johnson v. Towsley, 13 Wall. 72, 83; Steel v. Smelting Co.,
106 U. S. 447, 450; Noble v. Union River Logging Co.,
147 U. S. 165, 175; El Paso Brick Co. v. McKnight, 233
U. S. 250, 257; Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, 236
U. S. 397, 403; Burke v. Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 234
U. S. 669, 691.
In the light of the principles established by these
cases and many others which could be cited, there is but
one relief open to the United States with respect to patents issued unlawfully and through fraud, namely, a direct
suit in equity to vacate the same. So long as the patent
stands it is not merely an instrument of conveyance but
there inheres in it an irrefutable presumption that the
patentee was qualified, that he acted lawfully in making
his entry, and that the Land Department proceeded according to law. This being true, how is it possible for
the Government to secure relief by way of damages in
the face of a conclusive adjudication of regularity of which
the outstanding patent is the final evidence? The case
is not analogous to an action for deceit by an ordinary
vendor of land against the purchaser. His deed has
no effect except to convey title. It does not negative the
existence of fraud in its procurement and the vendor may
allow the conveyance to stand and sue for damages.
The federal courts which have recently sustained such
actions at law by the United States have completely overlooked this vital distinction. United States v. Koleno, 226
Fed. Rep. 180, 182; Pitan v. United States, 241 Fed. Rep.
364, 366; United States v. Jones, 242 Fed. 'Rep. 609, 615.
The decisions of this court in United States v. Minor,
114 U. S. 233, and Southern Pacific R. R. Co. v. United
States, 200 U. S. 341, do not conflict with the above views.

UNITED STATES v. WHITED & WHELESS.
552.

559

Argument of amicus curim.

In any event after the lapse of six years from the date
of the patent no relief can be secured by the Government
in any form of action founded on fraud or illegality attending its issue. The statute, as construed by this
court, has the effect of barring any proceeding founded
upon fraud or illegality in procuring the patent. United
States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., 152 Fed. Rep. 25; s. c.,
209 U. S. 447, 450; Louisianav. Garfield, 211 U. S. 70, 77.
The attitude of the Government in the present case is,
in effect, that the Act of 1891 only affects a remedy, namely,
a suit to annul a patent. If a void or voidable patent is,
after the lapse of the prescribed time, "to have the same
effect against the United States that it would have had
if it had been valid in the first place," Chandler-Dunbar
Case, supra, and if the statute affects the right as well as
the remedy, then it indubitably follows that as to any
remedy the Government may seek, whether by way of
proceedings to cancel or an action for damages, the patent
must be treated as though valid in the first instance. Any
other construction would permit a collateral attack where
a direct attack was prohibited-a practice always frowned
upon by courts of equity and of law; it would limit the
scope of the statute to the remedy-which this court has
said may not be done.
It was the intention of Congress that this statute should
apply to all forms of action affecting the substance given
by the patent. It can make little difference to a patentee,
or his grantee (unless the latter is still able to prove innocent purchase notwithstanding lapse of time), whether
the Government shall be allowed to take away his land
or the value of his land. For all practical purposes the
two are the same. It has been the practice of the Government to treat the title and its value as the same.
Act of March 3, 1887, 24 Stat. 556; United States v.
Southern Pacific R. R. Co., 200 U. S. 341.
This conclusion is alone in accord with the history of

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

246 U. S.

the Act of 1891, and with its practical application and
interpretation by the legislative and executive departments of the Government.
MR. JusTIcE CLImm delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a suit to recover from the liquidating commissioners and the former president of a dissolved corporation the value of public lands described in a patent
which it is alleged was procured from the Government by
the fraudulent conduct of the company and of its president.
A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the District Court, and this judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the cause of action stated was barred by the statute of limitations, which
reads as follows:
"That suits by the United States to vacate and annul any patent heretofore issued shall only be brought
within five years from the passage of this act, and suits to
vacate and annul patents hereafter issued shall only be
brought within six years after the date of the issuance of
such patents." Act of March 3, 1891, § 8, 26 Stat. 1099.
The patent involved was issued on December 12, 1898,
and if this case, commenced on December 29, 1914, were
one "to vacate and annul" the patent, plainly it would
be barred. But this being a suit to recover damages
from the fraudulent procurers of the patent, the question
presented for decision is, "Does the statutory bar to a
suit to annul the patent also bar a suit for the value of the
land fraudulently procured to be patented?"
The chief argument in support of the judgment of the
lower court is that while the Government before the
period of the statute had expired had two remedies, one
to annul the patent and one, affirming the patent, to recover the value of the land, yet they were both based on
one right, and that when the statute barred the suit to
annul, thereby the patent became as valid for the future

UNITED STATES v. WHITED & WHELESS.

561

Opinion of the Court.

as if it had been properly issued and that this cuts off the
right, and leaves the Government without further remedy.
This is begging the question. The statute of limitations did not create the right of action in the Government
or either of the remedies for enforcing that right. It relates to the remedy, and in terms applies only to one remedy, that for annulling the patent. The right of the Government, asserted in this case, really springs from the
fraudulent obtaining of the patent, not from the patent
itself, and this right continues until it is satisfied or cut
off by statute, and therefore, to say that the barring of one
remedy smothers the right to pursue the other, is mere
assertion, and does not advance us toward a conclusion
as to the effect, if any, which such bar may have upon the
other remedy, and the question we are considering remains unanswered, but becomes, What was the intention
of Congress, confessedly not clearly expressed, with respect to this issue, when it enacted this limitation statute?
Fundamental to the interpretation of the statute which
the answering of this question renders necessary, lies the
rule of law settled "as a great principle of public policy"
that the "United States, asserting rights vested in them
as a sovereign government, are not bound by any statute
of limitations, unless Congress has clearly manifested its
intention that they should be so bound," (United States
v. Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co., 118 U. S.
120, 125) and also the fact that this principle has been
accepted by this court as requiring not a liberal, but a restrictive, a strict, construction of such statutes when it
has been urged to apply them to bar the rights of the
Government. Thus, in Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United
States, 227 U. S. 355, 367, the limitation in the Act of
March 2, 1896, c. 39, 29 Stat. 42, was held not applicable to a patent erroneously issued for Indian lands under a railroad grant, and in La Roque v. United States,
239 U. S. 62, 68, the general language of the very act we

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

246 U. S.

are considering was held not applicable to a trust patent
for Indian reserved lands.
With this rule of interpretation and of practice under
it in mind, let us consider the scope of the limitation provision relied upon, which is found in § 8 of the Act of
March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1099, entitled, "An act
to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes."
This act is a very considerable amendment to and revision of laws relating to public lands and, as House Report No. 253, 54th Cong., 1st sess., shows, it grew out of
the insecurity and loss of confidence of the public in the
integrity and value of patent titles to public lands, which
had been occasioned by conflicting claims, chiefly between land grant railroad companies and the Government,
which had resulted in many suits being commenced to cancel patents. The statute was passed to promote prompt
action for annulling patents where cause therefor was believed to exist and to make titles resting upon patents
dependably secure when the period of limitation should
expire. As might well be anticipated, therefore, this
statute, originating in such conditions, was limited in its
terms to suits "to vacate and annul" patents, without
any reference being made to suits to recover the value of
the land when patents were fraudulently obtained, so that
only by extravagant interpretation can its bar be made
applicable to such suits,-and such interpretation we have
seen is forbidden.
To this we add that when the Congress really intended
to bar by limitation statute the right to recover the value
of lands, as well as the lands themselves, such intention
found clear expression in the Act of March 2, 1896, 29
Stat. 42, which modified, and in a measure is a substitute
for, the section we are considering, by declaring: "That
no suit shall be brought or maintained, nor shall recovery
be had for lands or the value thereof, that were certified or
patented in lieu of other lands," etc.

UNITED STATES v. WHITED & WHELESS.
552.

563

Opinion of the Court.

And finally, the decisions of this court furnish clear confirmation of the reality and substantial character of the
contention of the Government, by holding that when by
mistake public officers execute a patent to a railroad company for lands which had afterwards been conveyed to
purchasers dealing in good faith, the right of the Governmcnt to recover such lands was barred, but nevertheless
the right remained to sue for and recover the value of the
lands so wrongfully received and conveyed. Southern
Pacific R. R. Co. v. United States, 200 U. S. 341, 353.
Thus the rule and practice for interpreting the act, its
language, as well that which is omitted from it as that
which is contained in it, and the action of Congress in
dealing with a kindred subject-matter, all impel to the
conclusion that the omission of language barring the
right of the Government to recover the value of lands to
which a patent had been fraudulently obtained, was intentional and deliberate, to the end that patent titles
might be made secure but that persons who had defrauded the Government should not be protected by the
act in the enjoyment of their ill-gotten gains.
The support for the contention of the defendants in
error, contrary to this conclusion, which they claim to
find in United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co.,
209 U. S. 447, is based upon the statement that by the
statute the patent "is to have the same effect against
the United States that it would have had if it had been
valid in the first place." But that is merely an emphatic
way of saying that the title is made good. It does not import that the collateral effects of fraud in obtaining the
patent are purged. The element of bad faith or fraud was
expressly excluded.
While the Circuit Court of Appeals, as we have stated,
rested its decision wholly upon the limitation statute,
yet, under warrant of the claim in the demurrer that the
petition does not state a cause of action, it is further ar-

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.
Opinion of the Court.

246 U. S.

gued in this court, that if it be conceded that the right
of recovery by the Government is not barred, nevertheless such recovery is limited by § 2 of the Act of March 2,
1896, 29 Stat. 42, to the minimum government price for
the land, and since the petition shows that this amount
was paid to the Government when the patent was issued,
there can be no recovery.
But the Act of 1896 deals only with patents "erroneously issued under a railroad or wagon road grant" and
the limited recovery allowed is restricted to cases where
it shall appear that such erroneously patented lands
have been sold to bona fide purchasers. That such a
statute can have no application to such a case as we ate
considering is too obvious for comment.
This doctrine, that where there are two remedies for
the protection of a right one may be barred and the other
not, is no novelty in the law. So long ago as 5 Pickering, in Lamb v. Clark, pp. 193, 198, it was tersely stated
as then familiar doctrine that "If an injured party has
a right to either of two actions, the one he chooses is not
barred, because the other, if he had brought it, might
have been." And the principle has frequently been recognized by this and other courts. Lewis v. Hawkins,
23 Wall. 119, 127; Hardin v. Boyd, 113 U. S. 756, 765;
Kirkman v. Philips' Heirs, 7 Heisk. 222, 224; Ivey's
Administrator v. Owens, 28 Alabama, 641, 649; Ganley v.
Troy City National Bank, 98 N. Y. 487, 494.
The conclusions we are here announcing are in entire
accord with well considered opinions by two Circuit Courts
of Appeal, those of the Eighth Circuit, in United States v.
Koleno, 226 Fed. Rep. 180, and in Union Coal & Coke
Co. v. United States, 247 Fed. Rep. 106, and that of the
Ninth Circuit in Bistline v. United States, 229 Fed. Rep.
546.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
