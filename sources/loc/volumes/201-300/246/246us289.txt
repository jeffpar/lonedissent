CISSNA v. STATE OF TENNESSEE.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
TENNESSEE.
No. 20. Argued November 10, 1916; restored to docket for reargument
December 11, 1916; reargued October 9, 10, 1917.-Decided March 11,
1918.
If the state supreme court treats federal questions as necessarily involved and to reach its judgment necessarily decides them adversely
to the plaintiff in error, this court has jurisdiction to review them,
although not specially characterized as federal questions by the
plaintiff in error in the state courts.
This court has jurisdiction to review a judgment of the supreme court
of a State where the issues as to whether lands in question were
owned by the State, and whether they, and alleged trespasses upon
them, were within the State and so within the state court's jurisdiction, were determined affirmatively through a location of the state
boundary based upon interpretation of various treaties and acts of
Congress.
Whether two States of the Union, either by long acquiescence in a

practical location of their common boundary or by agreement otherwise evidenced, have changed the limits of their jurisdiction as laid
down by the authority of the general government in treaty or statute,
is in its nature a federal question.
Whether the state court has correctly followed the rules of erosion,
accretion or avulsion applicable to interstate boundary streams so as
to give proper effect to treaties and acts of Congress establishing a
river as an interstate boundary, is a question of federal law.
Upon the merits, which concern the location of the boundary between
Tennessee and Arkansas in the Mississippi River, this case is decided upon the authority of Arkansas v. Tennessee, ante, 158.

delivered the opinion of the court.

The State of Tennessee sued Cissna and others in a
court of equity'of that State, setting up ownership by the
State of that portion of the dry lands formerly a part of
the bed of the Mississippi River which lay between lowwater mark on the Tennessee side and the middle of the
river as it flowed prior to the change in the channel made
in the year 1876 by the opening of the Centennial Cut-off;
alleging that the defendant Cissna claiming ownership,
but having none, and the Muncie Pulp Company acting
under him, were cutting and removing timber from a
particularly described portion of those lands; and praying
for an injunction against further acts of trespass and
against the removal of the timber cut, and a recovery of
the value of the timber. Cissna pleaded in abatement that
the land described in the bill, except a small portion to

which he disclaimed title, was in the State of Arkansas
and not in the State of Tennessee, and hence that the
court had no jurisdiction over the controversy. His
codefendant having raised a similar issue, the cause came
on to be heard before a chancellor, who sustained the pleas
to the jurisdiction and ordered that the bill be dismissed.
Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of Tennessee, disregarding the form of the pleadings, treated the action as brought
to recover the land as well as to stay waste in cutting and
removing timber; and deeming that the question of jurisdiction which depended upon the location of the boundary line between Tennessee and Arkansas and the question of the right of the former State to recover the land
were practically the same question, considered them
together. The facts bearing upon the location of the
boundary, recited in the opinion of the court, were substantially the same as those upon which this court passed
in the boundary suit of Arkansas v. Tennessee, No. 4
Original, recently decided, ante, 158. The state court
held, contrary to the rule laid down by this court in Iowa
v. Illinois, 147 U. S. 1, and still adhered to, that the boundary line did not follow the middle of the channel of commerce, but was fixed and defined as "a line along the
middle of the main channel of the river equidistant from
the visible and permanent banks confining its waters."
The court found that the change made in the channel in
the year 1876 at Centennial Cut-off was an avulsion, and
declared that "the limits of Tennessee and Arkansas,
their respective rights in the abandoned channel, and those
of individuals who owned lands lying and abutting upon
it, all remained as they were before the formation of the
new channel." But, not carrying this into effect, it concluded that at the place where the lands sued for are
situate the correct boundary between the States was midway between the banks of the river as they existed in the
year 1823 as shown by the Humphreys map, notwith-

standing the fact that between that date and the time
of the cut-off the river had gradually encroached upon the
Tennessee shore, to a large extent in the aggregate; the
court holding that the effect of the avulsion was to press
back the line between the two States so as to restore to
Tennessee what it held before the erosions upon its banks.
And since it appeared that complainant had sued only for
the land lying on the hither side of the middle of the channel as it was in 1876, and therefore could not recover to
the middle of the channel of 1823, the court, on remanding
the cause for a hearing upon the answerA of defendants,
ordered that the bill might be amended so as to make the
proper averments to enable the State to recover under
the principles laid down in its opinion. State v. Muncie
Pulp Co., 119 Tennessee, 47.
The cause was remanded, the pleadings were amended,
and the suit remained pending in the trial court, when the
State of Arkansas filed its bill in this court against the
State of Tennessee to settle the boundary line between
these States along that part of the former bed of the
Mississippi River which was left dry as a result of the
avulsion of 1876, including the portion in dispute in the
present case; this being the same action above mentioned
as No. 4, Original. The pendency of that action was
brought by Cissna to the attention of the trial court in
the present case, and made the basis of an application for
a stay of proceedings until the boundary line between the
States should have been fixed and located by this court.
This application was overruled and the cause proceeded,
with the result that the chancellor made a decree against
Cissna on the merits in conformity with the opinion of
the Supreme Court, subject however to an accounting
with respect to the amount and value of the timber cut
and removed during the pendency of the suit. Upon
appeal to the Supreme Court this decree was affirmed,
with modifications not necessary to be mentioned, that

Opinion of the Court.

court ordered that a writ of possession be issued to place
the complainant State in possession of the tract of land
in controversy, and retained the case for an accounting
respecting the value of the timber. By way of objection
to the entry of a decree pursuant to the accounting that
followed, Cissna again called the attention of the court
to the boundary suit pending in this court, and prayed
for a stay of proceedings in the suit against him upon the
ground that any determination by that court not in
accordance with the determination of this court would be
void. This objection was overruled, a final judgment
or decree went against him for upwards of $110,000, and
the case was brought here by writ of error under ยง 237,
Judicial Code (36 Stat. 1156, c. 231), before the amendment of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726.
It was first argued at the October Term, 1916, when, for
reasons stated in 242 U. S. 195, it was restored to the
docket, and thereafter was heard at the same time with
the suit of Arkansas v. Tennessee.
Our jurisdiction is invoked upon the ground that the
decision of the state court of last resort was adverse to
the federal rights of plaintiff in error in two respects:
(1) in overruling his prayer for a stay of proceedings to
await the determination of the suit pending in this court
to settle the boundary line between the States; and (2) in
coming to an erroneous conclusion upon the merits of the
question of the proper location of that boundary. We
need not pass upon the first point, since we are of the
opinion that we have jurisdiction on the second ground,
and that the judgment under review must be reversed.
The record does not show that Cissna specially set up
in the state courts any contention that the decision of the
merits turned upon questions of federal law, except as
this may appear by inference from the nature of the
grounds upon which the decision was rested. But if the
Supreme Court of the State treated federal questions as

necessarily involved and decided them adversely to plaintiff in error, and could not otherwise have reached the
result that it did reach, it becomes immaterial to consider
how they were raised. Miedreich v. Lauenstein, 232 U. S.
236, 243; North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, -232 U. S.
248, 257; MallinckrodtWorkis v. St. Louis, 238 U. S. 41, 49.
The opinion of that court (119 Tennessee, 47) shows
that it treated the question of jurisdiction presented by
the pleas in abatement and the question of the title of
the State of Tennessee to the lands in controversy as both
dependent upon the location of the boundary, because
the State claimed the lands as a sovereign under the same
treaties and acts of Congress by which its western boundary was defined and established; and the court held that
the location of this boundary depended upon the interpretation of the Treaty of 1783 between the United States
and Great Britain (8 Stat. 80, 82, Art. II), the act of
cession from North Carolina to the United States made in
1790 (1 Stat. 106, c. 6), the Treaty of 1795 between the
United States and Spain (8 Stat. 138, 140, Art. IV), the
Act of Congress of June 1, 1796, admitting Tennessee
into the Union as a State (1 Stat. 491, c. 47), the Louisiana
Purchase Treaty of 1803 (8 Stat. 200), and the Act of
Congress of June 15, 1836, c. 100, 5 Stat. 50, admitting
Arkansas as a State. Upon a consideration of the Treaty
of 1783, which employed the expression "middle of the
said River Mississippi" to define the western boundary
of the United States, and interpreting this in view of the
use of the same expression in the previous Treaty of 1763
between Great Britain, France, and Spain (3 Jenkinson's
Treaties, 177), and declaring that the treaty with Spain,
which provided that the western boundary of the United
States should be "in the middle of the channel or bed of
the river," was not only an interpretation of the former
treaties, but superseded them, and construing the phrase
"middle of the main channel," employed in the act ad-

CISSNA v. TENNESSEE.

Opinion of the Court.

mitting Arkansas, as introducing no new meaning, the
court held that the expression "middle of the river," by
true interpretation, meant not the middle of the channel
of commerce, but a line midway between the visible and
fixed banks of the stream, and that any general rule of
international law to the contrary must yield to the intent
which the court deemed to be expressed in the treaties
and acts of Congress referred to.
Since the decision adverse to plaintiff in error turned
so clearly and essentially upon questions of federal law,
we have jurisdiction to review the resulting judgment.
And as the conclusion reached by the state court upon the
question of interpretation is directly opposed to that
reached by us in Arkansas v. Tennessee upon a consideration of the same pertinent treaties and acts of Congress,
we need only refer to our opinion in that case for a statement of the grounds upon which we hold that the state
court erred.
Two additional errors entered into the judgment, so
intimately connected with the question of interpretation
as to be inseparable from it.
The first of these was a decision to the effect that the
question of boundary had been settled by the duly constituted authorities of the two States, by judicial decisions,
legislation, long acquiescence, exercise of jurisdiction, and
other acts amounting to an agreement or convention defining the limit between the States to be the line midway
between the visible banks of the river. Obviously, whether
two States of the Union, either by long acquiescence in a
practical location of their common boundary, or by agreement otherwise evidenced, have definitely fixed or changed
the limits of their jurisdiction as laid down by the authority of the general Government in treaty or statute, is in
its nature a federal question. We have stated briefly, in
Arkansas v. Tennessee, the reasons why we are unable to
concur with the state court in its decision upon this point.

The remaining error arose in the determination of the
consequences of the avulsion of 1876. It is a part of the
law of interstate boundaries, that where a running stream
forms the boundary, if the bed and channel are changed
by the natural and gradual processes of erosion and accretion, the boundary follows the varying course of the
stream; while if the stream suddenly leaves its old bed
and forms a new one, the resulting change of channel
works no change of boundary, which remains in the
middle of the old channel although no water be flowing
in it. Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra. A correct application of this rule to changes in the Mississippi is necessary
in order that proper effect may be given to the treaties
and acts of Congress by which that river was established
as an interstate boundary, and hence this is a question of
federal law. The state court acknowledged the rule in
theory, but departed from it in fact. Starting with the
Humphreys map as showing the location of the banks of
the river as they were in -1823, the date to which the
earliest records related, and finding from the evidence that
between that date and the time of the avulsion there had
been gradual erosions from the Tennessee bank at the
place where the land in controversy is situate, to an extent sufficient in the aggregate to increase the width of
the river from a little less than a mile to between 1 j and
1'Y miles, the"court held that the subsequent emergence
of the bed of the river at this place, consequent upon the
avulsion of 1876, had the effect of pressing back the line
between the States to the middle of the old channel as it
ran in 1823, so as to restore to Tennessee what it held
before the erosions from its banks. This result was reached
by grafting upon the acknowledged rule as to boundary
streams an exception deduced from the rule of the common
law that lands once swallowed by the sea, if afterwards
exposed by its recession, are restored to the former owner
if they can be identified. As we have pointed out in

OETJEN v. CENTRAL LEATHER CO.
289.

Syllabus.

Arkansas v. Tennessee, it is a misapplication of this doctrine to treat it as forming an exception to the established
rule respecting the effect of erosion, accretion, and avulsion upon the course of a boundary stream.
We conclude, therefore, that the court erred in awarding
to the State of Tennessee a recovery of any land or damages for cutting and removing timber from any land
lying without the limits of the State as defined in our
opinion in Arkansas v. Tennessee, supra,being a line drawn
along the middle of the main channel of navigation of the
Mississippi River (as distinguished from a line midway
between the visible and fixed banks of the stream) as
it was at the time when the current ceased to flow therein
as a result of the avulsion of 1876, and without regard
to changes in the banks or channel that had occurred
through the natural and gradual processes of erosion and
accretion prior to the avulsion.
It results that the judgment of the state court must be
Reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
