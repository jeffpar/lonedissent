UNITED STATES v. SOLDANA ET AL.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA.
No. 325.

Argued March 4, 1918.-Decided April 15, 1918.

In view of restrictions and conditions for the protection of the Indians
contained in the Acts of May 1, 1888, c. 213, 25 Stat. 113, and February 12, 1889, c. 134, 25 Stat. 660, the grant made by the latter
to the Big Horn Southern Railroad Company of a right of way
through the Crow Reservation, whether amounting to a mere
easement, a limited fee, or some other limited interest, was not
intended to extinguish the title of the Indians in the land comprised
within such right of way; which, therefore, remains "Indian country" within the meaning of the Indian Liquor Act of January 30,
1897, c. 109, 29 Stat. 506.
Reversed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for the United
States.
No appearance for defendants in error.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The Act of January 30, 1897, c. 109, 29 Stat. 506,1 makes
it a criminal offence to introduce intoxicating liquors "into
the Indian country." For violating that law, Soldana and
Herrera were indicted in the District Court of the United
States for the District of Montana. The indictment

IThis repealed, so far as it was inconsistent, the Act of July 23,
1892, c. 234, 27 Stat. 260, which amended Revised Statutes, ยง 2139,
as amended by Act of February 27, 1877, c. 69, 19 Stat. 244.

charged that the liquor was introduced "within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation" in that
State, but upon "the station platform of the Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy Railway Company, at the town
of Crow Agency" upon the right of way of said railroad.
Defendants demurred, contending that the station platform was not within Indian country and that, therefore,
no offence was alleged. The District Court sustained the
demurrer and discharged the prisoners. The case came
here under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907,
c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
Crow Indian Reservation consists of nearly two and a
half million acres located in the southwestern part of
Montana. The Government agency is at Crow Agency
which lies north of the middle of the reservation on ihe
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railway, which runs
through the heart of the reservation from north to south.
The right of way is one hundred and fifty feet wide except
where additional ground is allowed for stations. Whether
or not the station platform is Indian country depends
upon the construction to be given to the act of Congress
granting the right of way. If the Indian title to the soil
on which the platform stands was extinguished by that
grant, the platform was not within Indian country. Bates
v. Clark, 95 U. S.204.' Did the statutes except from the
reservation the land on which the railroad was built and
extinguish the Indian title, or did they merely give to the
company a right of way or other limited interest in the
land on which to construct and operate a railroad?
'Other cases giving criteria for determining the meaning of "Indian country" are: American Fur Co. v. United States, 2 Pet. 358;

OCTOBER TERM, 1917.

Opinion of the Court.

246 U. S.

The statutes to be considered are Act of May 1, 1888,
c. 213, 25 Stat. 113, confirming the establishment of the
reservation and Act of February 12, 1889, c. 134, 25 Stat.
660, granting a right of way through the reservation to
the Big Horn Southern Railroad. Whatever rights it
acquired were transferred to the Burlington under Act of
March 1, 1893, c. 192, 27 Stat. 529.
The Act of 1888 provided that whenever, in the opinion of the President, public interests require the construction of railroads through any portion of the reservation,
the "right of way shall be, and is hereby, granted for
such purposes, under such rules, regulations, limitations, and restrictions as the Secretary of the Interior
may prescribe." The Act of 1889 provided, by ยง 3,
that "the surveys, construction, and operation of such
railroad shall be conducted with due regard for the
rights of the Indians and in accordance with such rules
and regulations as the Secretary of the Interior may make
to carry out this provision." Section 5 declared that the
grant of the right of way was upon the expressed condition
that the grantee and its successors "will neither aid, advise,
nor assist in any effort looking towards the changing or
extinguishing the present tenure of the Indians in their
land, and will not attempt to secure from the Indian tribes
any further grant of land or its occupancy than is hereinbefore provided: Provided, That any violation of the condition mentioned in this section shall operate as a forfeiture of all the rights and privileges of said railroad
company under this act."
Whether these acts should be held to have granted a
mere easement or a limited fee or some other limited
interest in the land, New Mexico v. United States Trust
Co., 172 U. S. 171; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Townsend, 190 U. S. 267; Rio Grande Western Ry. Co. v. Stringham, 239 U. S. 44; it is clear that it was not the purpose
of Congress to extinguish the title of the Indians in

the land comprised within the right of way. To have excepted this strip from the reservation would have divided it in two; and would have rendered it much more
difficult, if not impossible, to afford that protection to the
Indians which the provisions quoted were designed to
ensure. The case of Clairmont v. United States, 225 U. S.
551, which is the basis of the decision in United States v.
Lindahl,221 Fed. Rep. 143, relied upon by the lower court,
involved a statute which extinguished the Indian title.

UNITED STATES v. WEITZEL.
ERROR TO THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.

No. 567. Argued March 7, 1918.-Decided April 15, 1918.
Section 5209, Rev. Stats., punishing embezzlements and false entries
by any "president, director, cashier, teller, clerk, or agent" of a
national bank, does not apply to a receiver of such a bank, appointed
by the Comptroller of the Currency under Rev. Stats., ยง 5234; he
is an officer of the United States and not an agent of the bank.
Statutes creating and defining crimes are not to be extended by intendment upon the ground that they should have been made more comprehensive.

Affrmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for the United
States:
The powers, functions, and duties of a national bank
receiver are such as to constitute him an "agent" of the
bank, within the broad meaning of that word, as used
