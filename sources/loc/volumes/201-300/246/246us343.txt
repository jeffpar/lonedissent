OMAECHEVARRIA v. STATE OF IDAHO.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF IDAO.
No. 102. Argued December 20, 1917.-Decided March 18, 1918.

A law of Idaho (Rev. Codes, 1908, § 6872), applicable to the public
domain, provides that any person having charge of sheep who allows
them to graze on any range previously occupied by cattle, is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and that priority of possessory right between
cattle and sheep owners to any range is to be determined by the
priority in the usual and customary use of it, as a cattle or sheep
range. Experience, inducing this and similar laws, had, says the
Supreme Court of the State, shown that use of a range by sheep unfits
it for cattle, but not vke versa; and that segregation is essential to
protect the cattle industry and prevent serious breaches of the peace
between cattlemen and sheepmen.
Held: (1) That the police power of the State extends over the federal
public domain, at least where there is no legislation by Congress
on the subject.
(2) That in segregating sheep from cattle the Idaho law was primarily
designed to preserve the peace, and is not an unreasonable or arbitrary exercise of the police power.
Z3) That it does not discriminate arbitrarily and deny equal protection
in giving preference to cattle owners in prior occupancy without
giving a like preference to sheep owners in prior occupancy.
(4) That, as a criminal law, it is not wanting in due process, in failing
to provide for the ascertainment of the boundaries of a "range" and
for determining what length of time is necessary to constitute a prior
occupation a "usual" one within its meaning.
(5) That it is not in conflict with the clause in § 1 of the "act to prevent unlawful occupancy of the public lands," e.149, 23 Stat. 321,
which prohibits the assertion of a right to the exclusive use and
occupancy of any part of the public lands without claim or color of
title made or acquired in good faith, etc., since that clause, as is
shown by an examination of the entire act and its history, prohibits
merely the assertion of an exclusive right to use or occupati6n by
force, intimidation, or by what would be equivalent in effect to an
enclosure, whereas the state statute makes no grant, and, in so far
as this exclusion of sheep from certain ranges approaches a grant,

the result is incidental only, and it operates in favor of horse owners
as well as cattle owners.
(6) That the exclusion of sheep owners under certain circumstances
does not interfere with any rights of a citizen of the United States,
Congress not having conferred on citizens the right to graze stock on
the public lands, their use for that purpose being .merely by sufferance.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

plaintiff in error.

Idaho, and Mr. William Healy for defendant in error.
MR. JUsTIcE BRANDrIs delivered the opinion of the
court.
For more than forty years the raising of cattle and

sheep have been important industries in Idaho. The
stock feeds in part by grazing on the public domain of'
the United States. This is done with the Government's
acquiescence, without the payment of compensation,
and without federal regulation. Buford v. Houtz, 133
U. S. 320, 326. Experience has demonstrated, says the
state court, that in arid and semi-arid regions cattle will
not graze, nor can they thrive, on ranges where sheep are
allowed to graze extensively; that the encroachment of
sheep upon ranges previously occupied by cattle results
in driving out the cattle and destroying or greatly impairing the industry; and that this conflict of interests
led to frequent and serious breaches of the peace and the
loss of many lives.' Efficient policing of the ranges is

impossible; for the State is sparsely settled and the public domain is extensive, comprising still more than onefourth of the land surface.' To avert clashes between
sheep herdsmen and the farmers who customarily allowed their few cattle to graze on the public domain
near their dwellings, the territorial legislature passed in
1875 the so-called "Two Mile Limit Law." It was enacted first as a local statute applicable to three counties,
but was extended in 1879 and again in 1883 to additional
counties, and was made a general law in 1887. - After
the admission of Idaho to the Union, the statute was reenacted and its validity sustained by this court in Bacon
v. Walker, 204 U. S. 311. To avert clashes between the
sheep herdsmen and the cattle rangers, further legislation was found necessary; and in 1883 the law (now § 6872
of the Revised Codes,) was enacted which prohibits any
person having charge of sheep from allowing them to
graze on a range previously occupied by cattle.3 For

The land area of Idaho is approximately 53,346,560 acres [U. S.
Census (1910), vol. VI,p. 401], of which 20,000,000 acres were specifically classified as grazing lands. Report of Secretary of Interior
(1890), vol. I, p. XCI. In 1883 about 50,000,000 acres still formed a
part of the public domain. "The Public Domain," by Thomas Donaldson (1884), pp. 528, 529, 1190. On July 1, 1914, there were still
unappropriated and unreserved 16,342,781 acres. Report of Department of Interior (1914), vol. I, p. 207. The population of Idaho in
1880 was 32,610; in 1910 it was 325,594.

"Any person owning or having charge of sheep, who herds, grazes,
or pastures the same, or permits or suffers the same to be herded, grazed
or pastured, on any cattle range previously occupied by cattle, or upon
any range usually occupied by any cattle grower, either as a spring,
summer or winter range for his cattle, is guilty of a misdemeanor; but

violating this statute the plaintiff in error, a sheep herdsman, was convicted in the local police court and sentenced
to pay a fine.. The judgment was affirmed by an intermediate appellate court and also by the Supreme Court
of Idaho. 27 Idaho, 797. On writ of error from this court
the validity of the statute is assailed on the ground that
the statute is inconsistent both with the Fourteenth
Amendment and with the Act of Congress of February 25,
1885, c. 149, 23 Stat. 321, entitled, "An act to prevent
unlawful occupancy of the public lands."
First: It is urged that the statute denies rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, namely: Privileges of citizens of the United States, in so far as it prohibits the use of the public lands by sheep owners; and
equal protection of the laws, in that it gives to cattle own-

ers a preference over sheep owners. These contentions
are, in substance, the same as those made in respect to
the "Two Mile Limit Law," in Bacon v. Walker, supra;
and the answer made there is applicable here. The police power of the State extends over the federal public
domain, at least when there is no legislation by Congress
on the subject.' We cannot say that the measure adopted
any range is determined by the priority in the usual and customary
use of such range, either as a cattle or sheep range."
I The advisability of regulation by some system of leasing or licensing has been repeatedly recommended to Congress, and bills to
that end have been introduced, but none has been enacted. Report

by the State is unreasonable or arbitrary. It was found
that conflicts between cattle rangers and sheep herders
on the public domain could be reconciled only by segregation. In national forests, where the use of land is regulated by the Federal Government, the plan of segregation
is widely adopted.' And it is not an arbitrary discrimination to give preference to cattle owners in prior
occupancy without providing for a like preference
to sheep owners in prior occupancy.' For experience
shows that sheep do not require protection against encroachment by cattle, and that cattle rangers are not
likely to encroach upon ranges previously occupied by
sheep herders. The propriety of treating sheep differvol. I, p. 9. Cong. Rec., vol. 48 (1911-1912), p. 69. Hearings before

ently than cattle has been generally recognized. 1 That
the interest of the sheep owners of Idaho received due
consideration is indicated by the fact that in 1902 they opposed the abolition by the Government of the free ranges. 2
Second: It is also urged that the Idaho statute, being
a criminal one, is so indefinite in its terms as to violate
the guarantee by the Fourteenth Amendment of due process of law, since it fails to provide for the ascertainment
of the boundaries of a "range" or for determining what
length of time is necessary to constitute a prior occupation a "usual" one within the meaning of the act. Men
familiar with range conditions and desirous of observing
the law'wil have little difficulty in determining what is
prohibited by it. Similar expressions are common in
the criminal statutes of other States.3 This statute presents no greater uncertainty or difficulty, in application to
necessarily varying facts, than has been repeatedly sanctioned by this court. Nash v. United States, 229 U. S.
373, 377; Miller v. Strahl, 239 U. S. 426, 434. Furthermore, any danger to sheepmen which might otherwise
arise from indefiniteness, is removed by § 6314 of Revised
Codes, which provides that: "In every crime or public
offense there must exist a union, or joint operation, of
act and intent, or criminal negligence."

Third: It is further contended that the statute is in
direct conflict with the Act of Congress of February 25,
1885.1

That statute which was designed to prevent the

act to prevent unlawful occupancy of the public lands.
"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representativesof the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That all inclosures of any
public lands in any State or Territory of the United States, heretofore or to be hereafter made, erected, or constructed by any person,
party, association, or corporation, to any of which land included
within the inclosure the person, party, association, or corporation
making or controlling the inclosure had no claim or color of title made
or acquired in good faith, or an asserted right thereto by or under
claim, made in good faith with a view to entry thereof at the proper
land-office under the general laws of the United States at the time
any such inclosure was or shall be made, are hereby declared to be
unlawful, and the maintenance, erection, construction, or control
of any such inclosure is hereby forbidden and prohibited; and
the assertion of a right to the exclusive use and occupancy of any
part of the public lands of the United States in any State or any of
the Territories of the United States, without claim, color of title, or asserted right as above specified as to inclosure, is likewise declared unlawful, and hereby prohibited.
"See. 2. That it shall be the duty of the district attorney of the
United States for the proper district, on affidavit filed with him by any
citizen of the United States that section one of this act is being violated showing a description of the land inclosed with reasonable certainty, not necessarily by metes and bounds nor by Governmental
sub-divisions of surveyed lands, but only so that the inclosure may
be identified, and the persons guilty of the violation as nearly as may
be, and by description, if the name cannot on reasonable inquiry be
ascertained, to institute a civil suit in the proper United States district or circuit court, or territorial district court, in the name of the
United States, and against the parties named or described who shall
be in charge of or controlling the inclosure complained of as defendants; and jurisdiction is also hereby conferred on any United States
district or circuit court or territorial district court having jurisdiction over the locality where the land inclosed, or any part thereof,
shall be situated, to hear and determine proceedings in equity, by
writ of injunction, to restrain violations of the provisions of this act;

following clause with which the Idaho statute is said to conflict: "and the assertion of a right to the exclusive use and
occupancy of any part of the public lands of the United
ployee having charge or control of the inclosure; and any suit brought

under the provisions of this section shall have precedence for hearing
and trial over other cases on the civil docket of the court, and shall
be tried and determined at the earliest practicable day. In any case
if the inclosure shall be found to be unlawful, the court shall make
the proper order, judgment, or decree for the destruction of the inclosure, in a summary way, unless the inclosure shall be removed by the
defendant within five days after the order of the court.
"Sec. 3. That no person, by force, threats, intimidation, or by
any fencing or inclosing, or any other unlawful means, shall prevent
or obstruct, or shall combine and confederate with others to prevent
or obstruct, any person from peaceably entering upon or establishing
a settlement or residence on any tract of public land subject to settlement or entry under the public land laws of the United States, or shall
prevent or obstruct free passage or transit over or through the publie lands: Prouided, This section shall not be held to affect the rlight
or title of persons, who have gone upon, improved or occupied said
lands under the land laws of the United States, claiming title thereto,

whether as owner, part owner, or agent, or who shall aid, abet, counsel,
advise, or assist in any violation hereof, shall be deemed guilty of a

Opinion of the Court.

States in any State or any of the Territories of the United
States, without claim, color of title, or asserted right as
above specified as to inclosure, is likewise declared unlawful, and hereby prohibited."
An examination of the federal act in its entirety makes
it clear that what the clause quoted from § 1 sought to
prohibit was merely the assertion of an exclusive right
to use or occupation by force or intimidation or by what
would be equivalent in effect to an enclosure. That this
was the intent of Congress is confirmed by the history of
the act. The reports of the Secretary of the Interior
upon whose recommendation the act was introduced,
the reports of the committees of Congress, and the debates thereon indicate that this alone was the evil sought
to be remedied,1 and to such action only does its prohibition appear to have been applied in practice. 2 Although Idaho had, by statute, excluded sheep from portions of the public domain since 1875-no reference to
the fact has been found in the discussion which preceded
and followed the enactment of the federal law, nor does
any reference seem to have been made to the legislation
of other States which likewise excluded sheep, under
certain circumstances, from parts of the public do' Reports of Department of Interior (1882), vol. I, p. 13; (1883),

main. 1 And no case has been found in which it was
even urged that these state statutes were in conflict with
this act of Congress.
The Idaho statute makes no attempt to grant a right
to use public lands. McGinnis v. Friedman,2 Idaho, 393.
The State, acting in the exercise of its police power,
merely excludes sheep from certain ranges under certain
circumstances. Like the forcible entry and detainer act
of Washington, which was held in Denee v. Ankeny, ante,
208, not to conflict with the homestead laws, the Idaho
statute was enacted primarily to prevent breaches of
the peace. The incidental protection which it thereby
affords to cattle owners does not purport to secure to
any of them, or to cattle owners collectively, "the exclusive use and occupancy of any part of the public lands."
For every range from which sheep are excluded remains
open not only to all cattle, but also to horses, of which
there are many in Idaho.2 This exclusion of sheep owners
under certain circumstances does not interfere with any
rights of a citizen of the United States. Congress has.
not conferred upon citizens the right to graze stock upon
the public lands. The Government has merely suffered
the lands to be so used. Buford v. Houtz, supra. It is
because the citizen possesses no such right that it was
held by this court that the Secretary of Agriculture might,
in the exercise of his general power to regulate forest reserves, exclude sheep and cattle therefrom. United States v.
Grimaud,220 U. S. 506; Light v. UnitedStates, 220 U. S. 523.

SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 178. Argued March 11, 12, 1918.-Decided March 25, 1918.,

Liability over is the reason for a bailee's right to recover the full value
of the goods,-a reason which, whatever its inadequacy in history
or theory as applied to torts, applies with real force to contract relations like those in this case.
A transportation company, holding itself out as a common carrier by
sea, received consignments of goods, fixed and collected the freight,
loaded the goods on a vessel which it chartered for their carriage,
and issued bills of lading to the shippers signed by the master or
agents of the vessel. The vessel proved unseaworthy and the cargo
was lost. Held, that the company was liable over to the owners of
the cargo and by subrogation to the insurers, and could recover its
full value from the vessel owners under their express warranty of
seaworthiness, in the charter party, even if technically the possession of the cargo was with the vessel owners.
The Act of June 26,1884, c. 121, 23 Stat. 57, does not limit the liability
of a ship owner upon his personal warranty of seaworthiness.
A charter party, containing a warranty of seaworthiness, purported
to be entered into by a firm as agents of the vessel, but was signed
in the firm name by one of its members who was part owner. Held,
that the warranty was his personal contract.
An owner is liable on his express warranty of seaworthiness whether to
blame for the breach or not.
