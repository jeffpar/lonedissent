OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Statement of the Case.

264 U. S.

Plaintiff not having availed itself of the administrative
remedies afforded by the statutes, as construed by the
state court, it results that the question whether the tax
is vulnerable to the challenge in respect of its validity
upon any or all of the grounds set forth, is one which we
are not called upon to consider. The judgment of the
District Court is accordingly
Affirmed.

E. I. DUPONT DE NEMOURS & COMPANY v.
DAVIS, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF RAILROADS,
AGENT.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 517. Argued March 14, 1924.-Decided April 7, 1924.
1. In a complaint showing by apt allegation that the plaintiff sues
as the Director General of Railroads continued in that office by
the President under §§ 202 and 211 of the Transportation Act,
a description of him "as agent ", appointed under § 206 of the act,
may be rejected as surplusage. P. 459.
2. Paragraph (3), added by the Transportation Act to § 16 of the
Interstate Commerce Act and providing: "All actions at law by
carriers subject to this Act for recovery of their charges...
shall be begun within three years from the time the cause of
action accrues, and not after ", does not apply to an action by the
Director General of Railroads to recover demurrage charges accrued to the United States during the period of federal control of
railroads. Id.
287 Fed. 522, affirmed.
CERTIORARI to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed a judgment of the District Court
sustaining a demurrer to the complaint in an action by the
Director General of Railroads to recover demurrage
charges.

Argument for Petitioner.

Mr. Clifford H. Browder and Mr. C. A. Cunningham,
with whom Mr. Z. B. Harrison was on the brief, for
petitioner.
It was within the power of this Court to grant the
writ of certiorari, though the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals did not dispose of the case, it being one
where original jurisdiction was based only on diversity of
citizenship. Juct. Code, §§ 128, 240; American Constr.

Conqueror, 166 U. S. 110; Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v.
Wolf Bros. & Co., 240 U. S. 251.
The Circuit Court of Appeals erred in determining that
§ 16(3) of the Commerce Act, as amended by the Transportation Act, is not applicable to suits by the Director
General of Railroads for charges accruing during federal
control.
It was the policy of the Congress and the President to
operate federally controlled roads without the usual
immunity of the sovereign from legal liability. 39 Stat.

The exclusion of the Director General from certain
obligations in the Commerce Act shows that he was subjected to all other rights and duties in said act, including
the restrictions in § 16(3). Director General v. Viscose

The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that Davis,
Director General, in his capacity as federal agent, was the
proper party plaintiff, was based on an erroneous construction of the law. Transportation Act, §§ 202, 206,
211; Director General v. Struthers Furnace Co., 271 Fed.

Opinion of the Court.

X'R. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an action to recover demurrage charges accrued
at Little Rock, Arkansas, during May, June and July,
1918, on certain shipments of cotton linters. The defendant, petitioner here, demurred to the complaint on
the grounds: (a) That the cause of action was barred
by the statute of limitations; and (b) That plaintiff was
without authority to bring the action. The District Court
sustained the demurrer but was reversed by the Court
of Appeals. 287 Fed. 522.
There is nothing in the second point and we dispose of
it at once. The contention is that the authority to maintain the action is vested in the Director General of Railroads, originally designated under the Federal Control
Act and continued by the President under §§ 202 and
211 of Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 459,
469; and not in Davis, as Agent, appointed under s 206
of the latter act. Apt allegations, however, are found
in the body of the complaint to bring the plaintiff, Davis.
within the provisions of §§ 202 and 211. At most the
words" as agent " are surplusage; and it is impossible that
defendant could have been prejudiced by their use. Act
of February 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181.
The action was brought more than three years after
the cause of action accrued. The statute relied upon as
a bar is § 424, Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 491-492,
being a new paragraph added to § 16 of the Interstate
Commerce Act by way of amendment. The pertinent
words are: "(3) All actions at law by carriers subject to
this Act for recovery of their charges, or any part thereof,
shall be begun within three years from the time the cause
of action accrues, and not after." It is insisted that the
United States-or the Director General, representing the
United States-is included in the provision as a carrier

subject to the act. Our opinion is otherwise. The act
consists of five titles. Title II is devoted exclusively to
the subject of the termination of federal control, which
it is declared shall take place at 12.01 a. m., March 1,
1920,-the act becoming effective February 28, 1920.
Title III deals only with the subject of disputes between
carriers and their employees and subordinate officials,
creates Railroad Boards of Labor Adjustment and a Railroad Labor Board, and vests them with appropriate
powers. Title IV consists entirely of amendments to the
Interstate Commerce Act and includes § 424, here relied
upon. While these three titles are concerned with related
subjects, they are entirely distinct one from another.
Title II, which is complete in itself, among other things,
provides, § 200, that after the termination of federal control, the President shall have no power to use or operate
the railroads or systems of transportation, or to control or
supervise the carriers or their business affairs; and directs
him, § 202, to adjust, settle, liquidate and wind up all matters and all questions and disputes, of whatsoever nature,
arising out of or incident to federal control as soon as
practicable after the termination thereof. The only provision prescribing a period of limitation definitely in respect of such matters, is found in § 206 (a); and it relates
only to actions, suits and proceedings brought against an
agent to be designated by the President for that purpose,
and fixes as the period of limitation that now prescribed
by state or federal statutes, but not later than two years
from the passage of the act. In this Title, thus specifically
devoted to the subject of winding up matters arising out
of federal control, nothing is to be found which suggests
any limitation of time within which actions, suits or proceedings shall be brought to enforce liabilities arising out
of federal control, in favor of the United States.
Turning now to Title IV, amending the Interstate Commerce Act, the declaration at the beginning is that its

Opinion of the Court.

provisions "shall apply to common carriers" engaged in
various enumerated kinds of transportation. § 400, p.
474. There is to be found in this Title no provision
specifically relating to the period of federal control or
dealing with the question of liability to or of the Government in respect of any matter arising during such control.
If Congress had intended to fix a period of limitation
applicable to actions, suits or proceedings brought in
behalf of the United States in respect of liabilities arising
out of federal control, we should naturally expect to find
it in Title II, where such matters are exclusively dealt
with; and not in Title 111, which deals with common
carriers entirely apart from such control. It may not
have been unusual in common speech, to describe the Director General as a carrier while he was operating the railroads; but it is clear that he was not intended to be included by that term as it is generally employed in acts of
Congress. The Federal Control Act, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451,
repeatedly recognizes a distinction between the President-including, of course, the Director General-and the
carriers. The first section itself limits the meaning of the
word "carriers" to railroads and systems of transportation, which as carriers had been taken over by the President. Accurately speaking, the Director General was
not a carrier, but an operator of carriers. The distinction
to which we have referred, constantly appears in the provisions of the act, as, for example: "The President may
nevertheless pay to any carrier while under Federal control an annual amount," etc. § 2; "On the application
of the President or of any carrier," etc., § 3; "Carriers
while under Federal control shall be subject to all laws
and liabilities as common carriers," etc., § 10; "actions
at law or suits in equity may be brought by and against
such carriers," etc., § 10; "moneys and other property
derived from the operation of the carriers during Federal
control are hereby declared to be the property of the
United States," § 12.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 UT.S.

In taking over and operating the railroad systems of the
country the United States did so in its sovereign capacity,
as a war measure, "under a right in the nature of eminent
domain," North CarolinaR. R. Co. v. Lee, 260 U. S. 16;
Missouri Pacific R. R. Co. v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 250 U. S. 135; In
re Tidewater Coal Exchange, 280 Fed. 648, 649; and it
may not be held to have waived any sovereign right or
privilege unless plainly so provided. Moneys and other
property derived from the operation of the carriers during
federal control, as we have seen, are the property of the
United States. § 12, 40 Stat. 457. An action by the
Director General to recover upon a liability arising out
of such control is an action on behalf of the United States
in its governmental capacity, (Chesapeake & Delaware
Canal Co. v. United States, 250 U. S. 123, 126; In re
Tidewater Coal Exchange, supra) and, therefore, is subject
to no time limitation, in the absence of congressional enactment clearly imposing it. United States v. Nashville,
C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 118 U. S. 120, 125; United States v.
Whited & Wheless, Ltd., 246 U. S. 552, 561. Statutes of
limitation sought to be applied to bar rights of the Government, must receive a strict construction in favor of the
Government. United States v. Whited & Wheless, Ltd.,
supra.
The foregoing analysis of the acts of Congress viewed in
the light of the principles just stated, demonstrates that
§ 424 has no application to an action of the kind here
involved; but applies to common carriers apart from their
operation under federal control, and we so hold.
Affirmed.
