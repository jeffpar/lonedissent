met with that decision in the state court did the creditors
conclude to resort to the District Court. Even if that
decision was wrong, as they seem to think, it did not
change or affect the situation in the District Court.
In our opinion the bill could not be entertained as an
ancillary or dependent bill.
Judgment affirmed.

October 2, 1918, for loading with cattle to be transported
in interstate commerce as common carrier. This action
against Davis, the agent of the President designated
under Transportation Act, 1920, was brought in a state
court of Montana to recover damages for failure to supply
the cars. The plaintiff sued on an express contract to
furnish them on the day named. It was not shown, or
contended, that the published tariffs governing the contemplated shipment provided in terms for such a contract.
The defendant asked for a directed verdict; the request
was .refused; and the jury was instructed that, if the
promise was made, the defendant was liable for its breach,
even if the carrier was unable to furnish the cars. A verdict was rendered -for the plaintiff; the judgment entered
thereon was affirmed by the.highest court of the State;
and the case is here on writ of certiorari under ยง 237 of
the Judicial Code as amended. 262 U. S. 740. Whether,
under the Interstate Commerce Act as amended, the
express promise to furnish cars was valid is the only
question requiring decision.
The transportation service to be performed was that of
common carrier under published tariffs, not a special
service under a special contract, as in Chicago, Rock
Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Maucher,248 U. S. 359. The
agent's promise that the cars would be available on the
day named was introduced to establish an absolute obligation to supply the cars, not as evidence that the shipper
had given due notice of the time when the cars would be
needed, or as evidence that the carrier had not made
reasonable efforts to supply the cars. The obligation of
the common carrier implied in the tariff is to use diligence
to provide, upon reasonable notice, cars for loading at the
time desired. A contract to furnish cars on a day certain
imposes a greater obligation than that implied in the
tariff. For, under the contract, proof of due diligence
would not excuse failure to perform.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Opinion of the Court.

264 U. S.

Chicago & Alton R. R. Co. v. Kirby, 225 U. S. 155,
settled that a special contract to transport a car by a
particular train, or on a particular day, is illegal, when not
provided for in the tariff. That the thing contracted for
in this case was a service preliminary to the loading is not
a difference of legal significance. The contract to supply
cars for loading on a day named provides for a special
advantage to the particular shipper, as much as a contract
to expedite the cars when loaded. It was not necessary
to prove that a preference resulted in fact. The assumption by the carrier of the additional obligation was necessarily a preference. The objection is not only lack of
authority in the station agent. The paramount requirement that tariff provisions be strictly adhered to, so that
shippers may receive equal treatment, presents an insuperable obstacle to recovery.'
Reversed.

Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co., 76 W. Va. 803, and Stewart v. Chicago,
Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 172 Iowa, 313, were decided after the
