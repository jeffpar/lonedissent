RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 100
Argument for Petitioner.

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT COMPANY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREIE COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW

YORK.

No. 112. Argued November 14, 15, 1923.-Decided February 18, 1924.
1. A decision of the highest court of a State excluding maritime contracts from the operation of a state statute, not as a matter of
statutory construction but due to its opinion that the Federal
Constitution so requires, presents a constitutional question reviewable here. P. 120.
2. Under the provision of the Judicial Code (ยง 24, par. 3) vesting the
District Courts with exclusive jurisdiction of all civil causes of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction but saving to suitors the right
of a common law remedy, a State may confer upon its courts jurisdiction to specifically perform an agreement for arbitration valid by
the general maritime law and by the law of the State, which is
contained in a charter-party made in the State and which, by its
terms, is to be performed there. P. 122.
233 N. Y. 373, reversed.

CERTIORARI to a judgment of the Supreme Court of
New York entered on a judgment of the New York Court
of Appeals reversing a judgment of the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court, which had affirmed an order of the
Supreme Court, in New York County, by which the present respondent was directed to proceed to arbitration
under its contract contained in a charter-party, executed
in New York, whereby a vessel was chartered to the petitioner by the respondent.
Mr. Homer L. Loomis, with whom Mr. Reginald B.
Williams was on the briefs, for petitioner.
The agreement to arbitrate alone is the subject of the
statute, which prescribes the procedure, Berkovitz v.
Arbib & Houlberg, Inc., 230 N. Y. 261, and is intended
to compel specific performance of such agreements.

Argument for Petitioner.

264 U. S.

The courts have never denied that an agreement to
arbitrate creates a right, though public policy was thought
to forbid specific performance. Hamilton v. Home Ins.
Co., 137 U. S. 370.
The application of the statutory remedy to the independent contract to arbitrate incorporated in a charterparty does not infringe the jurisdiction of the admiralty
court; at least not unless this independent contract is
maritime and subject to the admiralty jurisdiction.
The agreement to arbitrate is not a maritime agreement
and is not within the jurisdiction of the admiralty court.
The essential requisite of a contract to bring it within
the admiralty jurisdiction and the true criterion for its
determination is an undertaking for the performance of
maritime services. North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros.
Co., 249 U. S. 119; People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How.
393; New Jersey Nay. Co. v. Merchants Bank, 6 How.
344; The Perseverance,Blatchf. & H. 385; Pacific Surety
Co. v. Leatham Co., 151 Fed. 440; 1 Am. & Eng. Encyc.
Law, 660.
The fact that the arbitration agreement is included in
a charter-party does not alter the nature of the act or
acts agreed to be done. A charter-party, while it is
characterized generally as a maritime contract, is to
speak more accurately a series of agreements, some of
which very often have no relation to a maritime service
and are unenforceable in an admiralty court. The agreement to arbitrate is obviously entirely independent of and
unrelated to the other covenants in the charter-party.
Brown v. West Hartlepool Nav. Co., 112 Fed. 1018;
Richard v. Holman, 123 Fed. 734; Richard v. Hogarth,
94 Fed. 684; Taylor v. Weir, 110 Fed. 1005; The Thames,
10 Fed. 848; Plummer v. Webb, 4 Mason, 380; Grant
v. Poillon, 20 How. 162; The Ada, 250 Fed. 194; Pacific
Surety Co. v. Leatham Co., 151 Fed. 440.
On any hypothesis, no reason exists for holding an
agreement to arbitrate to be maritime. Its enforcement

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 111
109

Argument for Petitioner.

no more calls for the application of any maritime principle than would a controversy as to fraud or mistake in
its inception, where only the common law courts (as distinguished from the admiralty courts) could assume jurisdiction of the controversy or grant any relief in reference
thereto.
If the subject matter of the agreement to arbitrate
is the subject matter of the various and varying controversies that may thereafter arise by reason of the asserted breach of other covenants of the principal contract, the measure of damages for the breach of the arbitration agreement in an action at law would not be the
loss resulting from the breach of that agreement, but
rather the loss suffered by reason of the alleged breach
of the other covenants of the contract; an obvious absurdity. Munson v. Straits of Dover S. S. Co., 99 Fed.
787, distinguished.
But even if the agreement to arbitrate should be considered maritime, the equity court has jurisdiction to
compel its specific performance. The Eclipse, 135 U. S.
599; Andrews v. Essex Ins. Co., 3 Mason,' 6; Meyer v.
Pacific Mail S. S. Co., 58 Fed. 923; Dean v. Bates, 2
Woodb. & M. 87; Kynock v. Ives, Newb. 205; Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522.
Settlement of maritime controversies by arbitration
is not inhibited by the provision conferring jurisdiction
of maritime causes on admiralty courts. Congress in its
exception did not save to suitors a remedy in the common law courts but a common law remedy. Berry v.
Donovan & Sons, 120 Me. 457. Arbitration, while not
an action, was nevertheless a well known remedy at common law for the settlement of controversies. Admiralty
courts, like the common law courts, have always considered as valid, and upheld, the awards made in such
controversies. Toledo S. S. Co. v. Zeith Transp. Co.,
184 Fed. 391.

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Argument for Petitioner.

264 U. S.

Whether a court intervenes to decree the specific performance of the agreement or it is carried out without
its intervention, the jurisdiction of the arbitrators, that
is the power to hear and determine, results from the
agreement of the parties, not from the mandate of the
court, and hence it would seem that their jurisdiction is
as valid in the one case as in the other.
The state court in enforcing an agreement does not
deny to the admiralty court its exclusive jurisdiction
merely because by reason of such enforcement a forum
other than the admiralty may determine the event and
measure of damages for the breach of a maritime contract. Pacific Surety Co. v. Leatham Co., 151 Fed.
440.
That a party by contract may waive not only his rights
under the maritime law, but also the right to resort to
the admiralty court for the adjustment of his disputes,
seems to be the effect of Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v.
Rohde, 257 U. S. 469. It is not the policy of the law to
compel parties to litigate disputes, maritime or otherwise.
West v. Kozer, 104 Ore. 94
The so-called public policy rule against specific performance of such contracts should not be extended. The
supposed policy itself is one of the common law; not of the
admiralty. It has been followed in the admiralty, as in
the state courts, in deference to early precedent, although
with frequent protest. United States Asphalt Co. v.
Trinidad Lake Co., 222 Fed. 1006; Atlantic Fruit Co. v.
Red Cross Line, 276 Fed. 319; Berkovitz v. Arbib & Houlberg, Inc., 230 N. Y. 276. It has now been repudiated and
abandoned by the courts of England in which it originated.

Even if the ultimate controversies between the parties
are the subject of the state remedy, the state remedy is the

equivalent of a common law remedy and is one that is
saved to suitors. The clause saving a common law remedy has always been held to confer concurrent jurisdiction
on the state courts to furnish a common law remedy in
civil cases of maritime origin even if the jurisdiction had
not existed before. New Jersey Nay. Co. v. Merchants
Bank, 6 How. 344; Propeller Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443;

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.
Argument for Respondent.

264 U. S.

Mr. John W. Crandall, with whom Edna Rapallo was
on the brief, for respondent.
The dispute between the parties herein arose out of a
maritime contract and hence is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, except as a common law remedy may have been saved to the petitioner. The New York Arbitration Law has provided a
new remedy, unknown to the common law, for the adjustment of controversies.
A charter-party is a maritime contract, and accordingly
within the exclusive admiralty and maritime jurisdiction
of the federal courts, except for the saving clause of the
Judicial Code. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How. 491;
Metropolitan S. S. Co. v. Pacific Alaska Nay. Co., 260
Fed. 973; Dunbarv. Weston, 93 Fed. 472.
The saving clause refers on its face to remedies, and this
has been construed to mean common law remedies and
not remedies in common law courts. The Moses Taylor,
4 Wall. 411; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S.
372. This Court has held that the New York Workmen's
Compensation Act provided a remedy and was unconstitutional in so far as such remedy was designed to cover
matters of a maritime nature. Southern Pacific Co. v.
Jensen, 244 U. S. 205; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart,
253 U. S. 149. In the present case, petitioner relies upon
the new remedy given by the Arbitration Law. Uerkovitz v. Arbib & Houlberg, Inc., 230 N. Y. 261; Red Cross
Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., 233 N. Y. 373.
It is highly questionable whether there is anything for
this Court to review, inasmuch as the Court of Appeals,
by holding that the Arbitration Law was not intended to
apply to maritime controversies, has left nothing of a
federal nature for this Court to consider. The Court of
Appeals has not passed upon the constitutionality of the
law. If it erred in deciding that the dispute is maritime,
the petitioner has in no way been deprived of any right
under the Federal Constitution and laws.

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 115
109

Argument for Respondent.

The agreement to arbitrate is part of a, maritime contract, and is void in the federal forum. To sustain and
enforce it, the state courts would deny to the federal court
the exclusive jurisdiction with which Congress has clothe,|
it, and likewise destroy a rule of uniformity.
The admiralty and maritime jurisdiction covers not
merely the cognizance of the case, but the jurisdiction
and principles by which it is to be administered. A State
has no right to step in and fill up by its own legislation
what is not actually occupied by that of Congress. The
Chusan, 5 Fed. Cas. No. 2717. It could not have been
the intention of Congress, by the exception, to give the
suitor all such remedies as might afterwards be enacted by
state statutes, for this would have enabled the States to
make the jurisdiction of their courts concurrent in all
cases. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555; Brookman v.
Hamill, 43 N. Y. 554; The Lottawanna,21 Wall. 558; The
J. E. Rumbell, 148 U. S. 1.
Not only have the States no power to enact laws giving
to suitors an admiralty remedy such as a suit in rem, but
they have no authority to pass any law regulating or affecting maritime matters which may tend to impair that
uniformity which is so essential to the application of the
maritime law through all of the States. Union Fish Co. v.
Erickson, 248 U. S. 308; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen,
244 U. S. 205; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S.
149; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372;

City, 179 U. S. 552; The Thielbek, 241 Fed. 209; Rodgers

Fruit Co. v. Red Cross Line, 276 Fed. 319.
When a party to an arbitration agreement initiates
proceedings in the New York Supreme Court under the
Arbitration Law to compel the other party to arbitrate,
he starts something which does not end until the issue has
been finally and completely settled. And the matter can

116

Argument for Respondent.

264 U. S.

be disposed of without the necessity of recourse to any
other court.
What would finally become of the admiralty law of the
United States if the act under consideration were held to
be a proper subject of state legislation as regards maritime
controversies? In the present case we should have such
questions as to whether or not the master prosecuted the
voyage with the utmost despatch, whether the vessel was
off hire under the "break-down" clause in the charter,
whether she encountered a peril of the sea, or whether
or not the deviation to the Azores was justified, submitted
to the decision of arbitrators who probably would not be
versed in the maritime law. Certainly they would not
be bound to follow any precedents, and in most cases
would probably not be lawyers, and their award could
only be set aside upon proof of fraud or of some other
irregularity.
The petitioner argues that the Arbitration Law has not
created a new remedy, but simply made available the old
common law remedy of specific performance. An arbitration agreement such as the present one was never an
enforceable agreement. United States Asphalt Co. v.
Trinidad Lake Co., 222 Fed. 1006; Insurance Co. v.
Morse, 20 Wall. 45; Doyle v. Insurance Co., 94 U. S.
535; Atlantic Fruit Co. v. Red Cross Line, 276 Fed. 319.
The only recourse which a suitor would have had previous
to the enactment of the Arbitration Law was a suit for
damages for breach of contract. Any argument as to
whether the statute created or made available a remedy
is foreclosed by the decision of the Court of Appeals in
this case.
The petitioner says the dispute is over arbitration, and
not over its right to the repayment of certain moneys.
The real object, however, was to have the right to reimbursement decided by arbitrators under the sanction of
the court. An arbitration clause in a charter-party is a

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 117

Argument for Respondent.

subject of admiralty jurisdiction. Munson v. Straits of
Dover S. S. Co., 99 Fed. 787.
In determining whether or not a contract is maritime,
we must look to its subject matter. This one was made
on land and would be performed on land, but nevertheless
refers to maritime disputes. North Pacific S. S. Co. v.
Hall Bros. Co., 249 U. S. 119; Baltimore Co. v. Paterson,
106 Fed. 736; Graham v. Oregon Co., 135 Fed. 608.
Furthermore, when petitioner demanded arbitration
and filed its petition, the matters in dispute were obviously maritime and such as the admiralty courts are considering daily. It follows that the agreement is maritime
and hence within the admiralty jurisdiction, except where
a common law remedy is saved. The Ada, 250 Fed. 194.
and Pacific Surety Co. v. Leatham Co., 151 Fed. 440,
distinguished. Cf. Haller v. Fox, 51 Fed. 289.
It is of course conceded that actions solely for the
breach of non-maritime covenants could not be maintained in an admiralty court simply because they were
contained in a contract otherwise maritime. Richard v.
Holman, 123 Fed. 734. This doctrine, however, is limited
to such covenants as are distinct and separate in themselves, and unrelated to the maritime provisions of the
agreement.
The cases of Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U. S. 233;
Grant Smith-Porter Ship Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469;
and Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation,
259 U. S. 263; in no way change or modify the rule laid
down in the authorities previously cited.
Not only cannot a State enact a law providing a remedy
of a peculiarly admiralty nature against a ship in rem,
but it cannot pass any law affecting matters of a maritime
nature which impairs or tends to impair the essential
uniformity of the maritime law in the United States.
The rule applied in Steamboat Co. v. Chase, supra,
where there was no remedy in the admiralty courts at

that time for the injury involved, cannot be applied in
the case of a claim connected with a charter-party, because the admiralty courts have always taken jurisdiction
of suits involving such agreements.
The argument that ofily a common law remedy is sought
flies directly in the face of the decision by the court below
that the law gives a statutory legal remedy of a character
unknown to the common law.
M . JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Arbitration Law of New York, enacted April 19,
1920, c. 275, and amended March 1, 1921, c. 14, declares
that a provision in a written contract to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising between the parties
"shall be valid, enforcible and irrevocable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract." It authorizes the Supreme Court,
or a judge thereof, to direct, upon the application of a
party to such an agreement, that the arbitration proceed
in the manner so provided; to appoint an arbitrator for
the other party, in case he fails to avail himself of the
method prescribed by the contract; and to stay trial of
the action, if suit has been begun. The law applies to
contracts made before its enactment, if the controversy
arose thereafter. Matter of Berkovitz v. Arbib & Houlberg, 230 N. Y. 261, 270, 271. Prior to this statute
an agreement to arbitrate was legal' in New York and
damages were recoverable for a breach thereof. Haggart
v. Morgan, 5 N. Y. 422, 427. But specific performance
of the promise would not be enforced; the promise could
not be pleaded in bar of an action; and it would not
support a motion to stay. Finucane Co. v. Board of Education, 190 N. Y. 76, 83. These limitations upon the
enforcement of a promise to arbitrate had been held to
be part of the law of remedies. Meacham v. Jame&-

Opinion of the Court.

town, etc. R. R. Co., 211 N. Y. 346, 352. The purpose
of the statute was to make specific performance compellable. 230 N. Y. 261, 269. Whether agreements for
arbitration of disputes arising under maritime contracts
are within the scope of the statute, and whether, if so
construed and applied, the state law conflicts with the
Federal Constitution, are the questions for decision.
Proceeding under the Arbitration Law, the Red Cross
Line applied to the Supreme Court of the State, on April
12, 1921, for an order directing the Atlantic Fruit Company to join with it in the arbitration of a dispute arising out of the charter of the steamship Runa. The substantive claim was that the master had not prosecuted
the voyage with the utmost dispatch and, hence, that
certain amounts paid by the charterer should be returned.
The charter party, which had been executed in New
York on November 28, 1919, contained the following
provision:
"That should any dispute arise between Owners and
Charterers, the matters in dispute shall be referred to
three persons in New York, one to be appointed by each
of the parties hereto, and the third by the two so chosen;
their decision, or that of any two of them, shall be final
and for the purpose of enforcing any award, this agreement may be made a rule of Court. .. "
Before instituting this proceeding the Red Cross Line
had duly appointed its arbitrator; but the Atlantic Fruit
Company had refused to appoint the one to be named
by it. The court ordered the latter company to proceed
to arbitration as provided in the contract, and to appoint
its arbitrator by a day fixed. This order was affirmed
by the Appellate Division without opinion. Its judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals, which stated
that the controversy between the parties is one of admiralty; that under Article III, ยง 2, of the Federal Constitution, and ยง 256, Clause Third, of the Judicial Code,

OCTOBER TERM, 1923.

264 U. S.

such controversies are within the exclusive jurisdiction

of the admiralty courts; and that the State had no power
to compel the charter owner to proceed to arbitration.

N. Y. 373. The case is here on writ of certiorari under
ยง 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended. 260 U. S.

Respondent contends that the petition should be dismissed for lack of a federal question. The argument is
that the Court of Appeals held, as a matter of statutory
construction, that the Arbitration Law does not extend to
controversies which are within the admiralty jurisdiction; and that the substantive claim sought to be enforced is so cognizable. The claim to recover an amount
paid under a charter party as charter hire is within the
admiralty jurisdiction. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How.
491. If that court had construed the Arbitration Law as
excluding from its scope controversies which are within
the admiralty jurisdiction, the construction given to the
state statute would bind us; and there would be no
occasion to consider the constitutional question presented.
Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 255 U. S. 445; Ward & Gow v. Krinsky, 259 U. S.
503, 510. An expression used by the Court of Appeals
lends some color to respondent's contention, 233 N. Y.
373, 381. But a reading of the whole opinion shows that
the state court excluded maritime contracts from the operation of the law, not as a matter of statutory construction, but because it thought the Federal Constitution required such action. Compare State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corporation, 259 U. S. 263. We proceed, therefore, to the consideration of the constitutional
question.
The federal courts--like those of the States and of England-have, both in equity and at law, denied, in large
measure, the aid of their processes to those seeking to en-

force executory agreements to arbitrate disputes. They
have declined to compel specific performance, Tobey v.
County of Bristol, 3 Story, 800, 819-826; 1 or to stay proceedings on the original cause of action. Story, Equity
Jurisprudence, ยง 670. They have not given effect to the
executory agreement as a plea in bar; except in those cases
where the agreement, leaving the general question of liability to judicial decision, confines the arbitration to determining the amount payable or to furnishing essential evidence of specific facts, and makes it a condition precedent
to the cause of action. Hamiton v. Liverpool, London &
Globe Insurance Co., 136 U. S.242, 255; Martinsburg &
Potomac R. R. Co. v. March, 114 U. S.549. But an agreement for arbitration is valid, even if it provides for the determination of liability. If executory, a breach will support an action for damages. Hamilton v. Home Insurance
Co., 137 U. S.370, 385-386. If executed,-that is, if the
award has been made,-effect will be given to the award in
any appropriate proceeding at law, or in equity. Karthauzs

have no just objection to these domestic forums, and will enforce, and
promptly interfere to enforce their awards when fairly and lawfully
made, without hesitation or question. But when they are asked t,)
proceed farther and to compel the parties to appoint arbitrators
whose award shall be final, they necessarily pause to consider, whether
such tribunals possess adequate means of giving redress, and whether
they have a right to compel a reluctant party to submit to such a
tribunal, and to close against him the doors of the common Courts of
justice, provided by the Government to protect rights and to redress

wrongs."

,arly as 1320. Selden Society, Select Pleas in the Court of Adiniralty, Vol. 1, pp. xdi, xdii. After the establishment of that court.
(about 1340, ibid xiv) arbitration became a common mode of settling
disputes in shipping cases. "The parties appear to have usually
executed a bond or entered into recognizance in the Admiralty Court
to execute the award; there are several suits to enforce such a bond
or to compel performance of the award." Ibid. Ixix; li; [1539], p.

(1886), pp. 268, 270. The form appears as clause 15 of the charter
party executed in New York in 1885 which was involved in Compania
Bilbaina v. Spanish-American Light & Power Co., 146 U. S. 483.

Opinion of the Court.

An award will be given full effect.5 The agreement
whether executory or executed, can not be enforced in a1miralty by specific performance; merely because that
court lacks the power to grant equitable relief. Th'
Eclipse, 135 U. S. 599, 608.6 The executory agreement
(perhaps in deference to the rule prevailing at law and ill
equity) will not be given effect as a bar to a libel on the
original cause of action. The reluctance of the admiralty
court to lend full aid goes, however, merely to the remedy.
The substantive right created by an agreement to submit
disputes to arbitration is recognized as a perfect obligation.7
By reason of the saving clause, state courts have jurisdiction in personam, concurrent with the admiralty courts,
of all causes of action maritime in their nature arising
under charter parties. Judiciary Act of September 24,
1789, c. 20, ยง 9, 1 Stat. 73, 77; Judicial Code, ยง 24, par. 3;

102 U. S. 118; Chappell v. Bradshaw, 128 U. S. 132; De
Lovio v. Boit, 2 Gall. 398, 475. The "right of a common

held in cases which presently will be mentioned, include

attempted changes by the States in the substantive admiralty law, but it does include all means other than proceedings in admiralty which may be employed to enforce
the right or to redress the injury involved. It includes
remedies in pas, as well as proceedings in court; judicial
remedies conferred by statute, as well as those existing at
the common law; remedies in equity, as well as those enforceable in a court of law. Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638, 644, et seq.; Rounds v. Cloverport
Foundry & Machine Co., 237 U. S. 303. A State may not
provide a remedy in rem for any cause of action within the
admiralty jurisdiction. The Hine v. Trevor, 4 Wall. 555;
The Glide, 167 U. S. 606. But otherwise, the State, having concurrent jurisdiction, is free to adopt such remedies,
and to attach to them such incidents, as it sees fit. New
York, therefore, had the power to confer upon its courts
the authority to compel parties within its jurisdiction to
specifically perform an agreement for arbitration, which
is valid by the general maritime law, as well as by the law
of the State, which is contained in a contract made in New
York and which, by its terms, is to be performed there.
This state statute is wholly unlike those which have recently been held invalid by this Court. The Arbitration
Law deals merely with the remedy in the state courts in
respect of obligations voluntarily and lawfully incurred.
It does not attempt either to modify the substantive maritime law or to deal with the remedy in courts of admiralty.
The Workmen's Compensation Laws involved in Southern
Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205; Clyde S. S. Co. v.
Walker, 244 U. S. 255; Peters v. Veasey, 251 U. S. 121;
and Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S. 149, were
declared invalid, because their provisions were held to
modify or displace essential features of the substantive
maritime law. In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248 U. S.
308, the state statute did not deal with the substantive
maritime law. It was held invalid, because, as construed

and applied, it attempted to modify the remedial law of
the admiralty courts. The state statutes involved in all
the other cases were declared valid. Those giving the
substantive right to recover for negligence resulting in
death were upheld, because they merely supplemented
the substantive maritime law and did not conflict with
any essential feature of it. Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia,
257 U. S. 233; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Kierejewski, 261 U. S. 479. See also Steamboat Co. v. Cha.sc.
16 Wall. 522; Sherlock v. Ailing, 93 U. S. 99, 104; The
Hamilton 207 U. S. 398; La Bourgogne, 210 U. S. 95, 138,
The Workmen's Compensation Laws involved in other
cases were upheld, because their provisions, as applied,
were found not to be in conflict with any essential feature
of the general maritime law. Grant Smith-Porter Ship
Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469; Industrial Commission v.
Nordenholt Co., 259 U. S. 263. No state statute was involved in Chelentis v. Luckevbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372.
The Court held there that under the general maritime law
the seaman had no substantive right to recover; that this
rule of substantive maritime law applied whether he sued
in the state courts or in the court of admiralty; and that
the Seaman's Act of 1915 did not change this rule of substantive law. In no case has this Court held void a state
statute which neither modified the substantive maritime
law, nor dealt with the remedies enforceable in admiralty.
As the constitutionality of the remedy provided by
New York for use in its own courts is not dependent upon
the practice or procedure which may prevail in admiralty,
we have no occasion to consider whether the unwillingness
of the federal courts to give full effect to executory agreements for arbitration can be justified.'

The separate opinion of MR.

264 U. S.

JUSTICE IM]CREYNOLDS.

This controversy arose out of a charter-party dated
November 28, 1919, a maritime contract, which contains
a clause providing for the settlement of disputes by arbitration. 233 N. Y. 373.
Parties to such agreements contract with reference to
the maritime law; consequent rights and liabilities depend upon its rules and are the same in all courts, admiralty or state. This general doctrine, definitely stated
in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 244 U. S. 205, has been
reaffirmed and applied again and again. Clyde S. S. Co.
v. Walker, 244 U. S. 255; Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S.
Co., 247 U. S. 372; Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, 248
U. S. 308; Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Stewart, 253 U. S.
149; Western Fuel Co. v. Garcia, 257 U. S. 233; Grant
Smith-PorterShip Co. v. Rohde, 257 U. S. 469; Carlisle
Packing Co. v. Sandanger,259 U. S. 255; Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Co., 259 U. S. 263; Osaka Shosen
Kaisha v. Pacific Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 490; Great
Lakes Co. v. Kierejewski, 261 U. S. 479.
No admiralty court would enforce the arbitration clause
of the charter-party before us--their accepted policy
forbids. Accordingly, it was not obligatory upon the
parties. The law of the sea became part of their agreement.
But it is said, under the local law a state court may enforce arbitration and thus effectuate the provision, although unenforceable in admiralty, since the statute relates to the remedy and not to substantive rights. In
Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, an admiralty cause, we refused to give effect to the state statute of frauds, holding
that the parties had contracted with reference to maritime law, not the local enactment. Here, also, the effort
is to modify an agreement made with reference to the
general rules of maritime law by applying the local law.
Certainly this could not be done in an admiralty court;

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 127

MeRLYNOLDS,

J., dissenting.

no more should it be possible under state practice. If
Union Fish Co. and Erickson had been before a state
tribunal the applicable rule would have been the same
and would have required enforcement of the contract notwithstanding the local statute. Obligations under maritime contracts do not vary with the tribunal.
Fifty years ago this Court pointed out the essential
relationship between rights and remedies. Von. Hoffman
v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 552. "Nothing can be
more material to the obligation than the means of enforcement. Without the remedy the contract may, indeed, in the sense of the law, be said not to exist, and
its obligation to fall within the class of those moral and
social duties which depend for their fulfilment wholly
upon the will of the individual. The ideas of validity
and remedy are inseparable, and both are parts of the
obligation, which is guaranteed by the Constitution
against invasion. The obligation of a contract 'is the
law which binds the parties to perform their agreement.'"
Under the guise of providing remedies no state statute
may add to or take from the obligations imposed by the
contract within the admiralty jurisdiction. The doctrine
concerning the general maritime law announced here
over and over again forbids. If state courts can enforce
provisions for compulsory arbitration contrary to the
policy of the admiralty courts, what will become of the
uniformity of maritime rules which the Constitution undertook to establish?
The Judicial Code, ยง 256, endows the District Court
with exclusive jurisdiction "of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all
cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it." The remedy saved
must relate to some right or liability given or imposed
by maritime law-certainly not one which that law does

MCREYNOLDS, J., dissenting.

264 U.S.

not recognize. Furthermore, common-law remedy is the
thing excepted from the exclusive jurisdiction, not a
remedy wholly unknown to that law. The Moses Taylor,
4 Wall. 411, 430, 431, distinctly announced this construction"The cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction vested in the District Courts by the
ninth section of the Judiciary Act, may be supported
upon like considerations. It has been made exclusive by
Congress, and that is sufficient, even if we should admit
that in the absence of its legislation the State courts might
have taken cognizance of these causes. But there are
many weighty reasons why it was so declared. 'The
admiralty jurisdiction,' says Mr. Justice Story, 'naturally
connects itself, on the one hand, with our diplomatic
relations . and the duties to foreign nations and their
subjects; and, on the other hand, with the great interests
of navigation and commerce, foreign and domestic.
There is, then, a peculiar wisdom in giving to the national
government a jurisdiction of this sort which cannot be
yielded, except for the general good, and which multiplies
the securities for the public peace abroad, and gives to
commerce and navigation the most encouraging support
at home.'
"The case before us is not within the saving clause of
the ninth section. That clause only saves to suitors 'the
right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is
competent to give it.' It is not a remedy in the commonlaw courts which is saved, but a common-law remedy. A
proceeding in rem, as used in the admiralty courts, is not
a remedy afforded by the common law; it is a proceeding
under the civil law. When used in the common-law
courts, it is given by statute."
The same view is approved by The Hine v. Trevor, 4
Wall. 555, 571; The Glide, 167 U. S. 606, 616, 617; and
Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey, 177 U. S. 638, 644, 648.

RED CROSS LINE v. ATLANTIC FRUIT CO. 129

MOREYNOLDS,

J., dissenting.

The latter cause "was clearly one in personam to enforce
a common-law remedy." The opinion carefully points
out that the state court enforced such a remedy and.
further, (p. 640) that not until 1866, The Moses Taylor,
was the exclusive character of admiralty jurisdiction
brought to this Court's attention. Earlier opinions must
be read accordingly, with Southern Pacific Co. v. .Jensen
and the uniformity of maritime rules in mind. Rounds
v. Cloverport Foundry, 237 U. S. 3G3, 308, follows Knapp,
Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey.
Even where permitted by local law state courts cannot
entertain proceedings in rein Tor the reason stated by The
Moses Taylor. "A proceeding in rem, as used in the
admiralty courts, is not a remedy afforded by the common
law; it is a proceeding under the civil law. When used
in the common-law courts, it is given by statute." The
same reason inhibits state courts from enforcing any
remedy not recognized at common law when the controversy is within the admiralty cognizance. Common-law
remedies are within the saving clause, and no others. It
is not enough that one has been provided by statute.
The Hine v. Trevor (p. 571) declares-" But it could
not have been the intention of Congress, by the exception
in that section, to give the suitor all such remedies as
might afterwards be enacted by State statutes, for this
would have enabled the States to make the jurisdiction
of their courts concurrent in all cases, by simply providing
a statutory remedy for all cases. Thus the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Federal courts would be defeated."
This negatives the suggestion that the remedy of the
saving clause includes any means other than proceedings
in rem which may be provided for the enforcement of
rights or to redress injuries.
Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey (p. 648) clearly
affirms that the thing saved to suitors is the right of a
common-law remedy. "The true distinction between
9785*1

264 U. S.

such proceedings as are and such as are not invasions of
the exclusive admiralty jurisdiction is this: If the cause
of action be one cognizable in admiralty, and the suit be
in rem against the thing itself, though a monition be also
issued to the owner, the proceeding is essentially one in
admiralty. If, upon the other hand, the cause of action
be not one of which a court of admiralty has jurisdiction,
or if the suit be in personam against an individual
defendant, with an auxiliary attachment against a particular thing, or against the property of the defendant in
general, it is essentially a proceeding according to the
course of the common law, and within the saving clause
of the statute (sec. 563) of a common-law remedy. The
suit in this case being one in equity to enforce a commonlaw remedy, the state courts were correct in assuming
jurisdiction."
I can find no authority for the broad claim that the
"right of a common-law remedy" extends to any and all
means other than proceedings in rem which may be employed to enforce rights or redress injuries, including
remedies in pais as well as proceedings in court, those
conferred by statute as well as those existing at common
law. Neither Knapp, Stout & Co. v. McCaffrey nor
Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry supports it. It conflicts
with The Hine v. Trevor, and is clearly opposed by the
reason advanced in The Moses Taylor for excluding proceedings in rem from state courts.
The court below has held' that the New York arbitration law, c. 275, Laws N. Y. 1920,2 provides "a statutory
'Matter of Berkovitz v. Arbib & Houlberg, 230 N. Y. 261, 269.

or a submission hereafter entered into of an existing controversy to

such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any

an ancient rule." This statutory remedy is not of the
common law nor were the proceedings under review instituted to enforce such a remedy, as was Knapp, Stout &
Co. v. McCaffrey. See Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen.

If petitioner is right, why may not a State require the
parties to any maritime contract to submit their controversies to varying methods of arbitration and thus introduce the very discord which framers of the Constitution
intended to prevent by adopting general maritime rules as
laws of the United States? Also why may it not apply
other than common-law remedies to controversies within
admiralty jurisdiction contrary to plain congressional enactment and repeated decisions of this Court?
To announce principles is not enough; they should be
followed. I think opinions of this Court led the conclusion of the court below and require affirmation of its
judgment.
