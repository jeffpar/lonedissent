NEW YORK CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY v.
WINFIELD.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT, APPELLATE DIVISION, THIRD
JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT, OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 321. Argued February 29, March 1, 1916; restored to docket for reargument November 13, 1916; reargued February 1, 1917.-Decided
May 21, 1917.
The liabilities and obligations of interstate railroad carriers to make
compensation for personal injuries 'suffered by their employees while
engaged in interstate commerce are regulated both- inclusively and
exclusively by the Federal Employers' Liability Act; and, Congress
having thus fully covered the subject, no room exists for state regulation, even in respect of injuries occurring without fault, as to which
the federal act provides no remedy.
Therefore, an award made under the New York Workmen's Compensation Act for injuries not attributable to negligence, which were received by an employee of an interstate railroad carrier while both
were engaged in interstate commerce, cannot be upheld.

whereby he lost the use of an eye. At that time the railroad company was engaging in interstate commerce as a
common carrier and Winfield was employed by it in such
commerce. The injury was not due to any fault or negligence of the carrier, or of any of its officers, agents or
employees, but arose out of one of the ordinary risks of
the work in which Winfield was engaged. He was a section laborer assisting in the repair of the carrier's main
track and while tamping cross-ties struck a pebble which
chanced to rebound and hit his eye. Following the injury
he sought compensation therefor from the carrier under
the Workmen's Compensation Law of the State I and an
award was made to him by the state commission, one
member dissenting. The carrier appealed and the award
was affirmed by the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court, two judges dissenting, 168 App. Div. 351, and also
by the Court of Appeals, 216 N. Y. 284. Before the commission and in the state courts the carrier insisted that its
liability or obligation and the employee's right were governed exclusively by the Employers' Liability Act of
Congress, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65; c. 143, 36 Stat. 291, and
therefore that no award could be made under the law of
the State. That insistence is renewed here.
It is settled that under the commerce clause of the Constitution Congress may regulate the obligation of common
carriers and the rights of their employees arising out of
injuries sustained by the latter where both axe engaged in
interstate commerce; and it also is settled that when
Congress acts upon the subject all state laws covering
the same field are necessarily superseded by reason of the
supremacy 'of- the national authority. 2 Congress acted

upon the subject in passing the Employers' Liability Act,
and the extent to which that act covers the field is the
point in controversy. By one side it is said that the act,
although regulating the liability or obligation of the carrier and the right of the employee where the injury results
in whole or in part from negligence attributable to the
carrier, does not cover injuries occurring without such
negligence, and therefore leaves that class of injuries to be
dealt with by state laws; and by the other side it is said
that the act covers both classes of injuries and is exclusive
as to both. The state decisions upon the point are conflicting. The New York court in the present case and the
New Jersey court in Winfield v. Erie R. R. Co., 88 N. J. L.
619, hold that the act relates only to injuries resulting
from negligence, while the California court in Smith v.
Industrial Accident Commission, 26 Cal. App. 560, and
the Illinois court in Staley v. Illinois Central R. R. Co.,
268 Illinois, 356, hold that it has a broader scope and
makes negligence a test,-not of the applicability of the
act, but 6f the carrier's duty or obligation to respond
pecuniarily for the injury.
In our opinion the latter view is right and the other
wrong. Whether and in what circumstances railroad companies engaging in interstate commerce shall be required
to compensate their employees in such commerce for injuries sustained therein are matters in which the Nation
as a whole is interested and there are weighty considerations why the controlling law should be uniform and not
change at every state line. Baltimare & Ohio R. R. Co. v.
Baugh, 149 U. S. 368, 378-379. It was largely in recognition of this that the Employers' Liability Act was
enacted by Congress. Second Employers' Liability Cases,

ing a message from the President advocating an adequate
national law covering all such injuries and leaving to the
action of the several States only the injuries occurring
in intrastate employment. Cong. Rec., 60th Cong., 1st
sess., 1347. And the reports of the congressional committees having the bill in charge disclose, without any
uncertainty, that it was intended to be very comprehensive, to withdraw all injuries to railroad employees in interstate commerce from the operation of varying state laws
and to apply to them a national law having a uniform
operation throughout all the States. House Report No.
1386 and Senate Report No. 460, 60th Cong., 1st sess.
Thus, in the House Report it is said: "It [the bill] is intended in its scope to cover all commerce to which the
regulative power of Congre~s extends . . . by this
bill it is hoped to fix a uniform rule of liability throughout
the Union with reference to the liability of common carriers to their employees. . . . A Federal statute of
this character will supplant the numerous State statutes
on the subject so far as they relate to interstatd commerce.
It will create uniformity throughout the Union, and the
legal status of such employer's liability for personal injuries instead of being subject to numerous rules will be
fixed by one rule in all the States."
True, the act does not require the carrier to respond for
injuries occurring where it is not chargeable with negligence, but this is because Congress, in its discretion,
acted upon the principle that compensation should be
exacted from the carrier where, and only where, the injury
results from negligence imputable to it. Every part of the
act conforms to this principle, and no part points to any
purpose to leave the States free to requiie compensation
where the act withholds it. By declaring in ยง 1 that the
carrier shall be liable in damages for an injury to the
employee "resulting in whole or in part from the negligence
of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier,

Opinion of the Court.

or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its
negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery,
track," etc.,I the act plainly shows, as was expressly held
in Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, 233 U. S. 492, 501,
that it was the intention of Congress to make negligence
the basis of the employee's right to damages and to exclude responsibility of the carrier to the employee for an
injury not resulting from its negligence or that of its
officers, agents or other employees. The same principle
is seen also in ยง 3, which requires that where the carrier
and the employee are both negligent the recovery shall
be diminished in proportion to the employee's contribution to the total negligence, and in ยง 4, which 'egards injuries arising from risks assumed by the employee as
among those for which the carrier should not be made to
respond. The committee reports upon the bill show that
this principle was adopted deliberately, notwithstanding
there were those within and without the committees who
looked with greater favor upon a different principle which
puts negligence out of view and regards the employee as
entitled to compensation wherever the injury is an incident
of the service in which he is employed. A few years after
the passage of the act a legislative commission drafted
and the Committees on the Judiciary in the two houses of
Congress favorably reported a bill substituting the latter
principle for the other, Senate Report No. 553, 62d Cong.,
2d sess., House Report No. 1441, 62d Cong., 3d sess., but
that bill did not become a law.
That the act is comprehensive and also exclusive is distinctly recognized in repeated decisions of this court.
Thus, in Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf, 226
U. S. 570, 576, and other cases, it is pointed out that the
subject which the act covers is "the responsibility of

interstate carriers by railroad to their employ~s injured
in such commerce"; in Michigan Central R. R. Co. v.
Vreeland, 227 U. S. 59, 66, 67, it is said that "we may not
piece out this act of Congress by resorting- to the local
statutes of the State of procedure or that of the injury,"
that by it "Congress has undertaken to cover the subject
of the liability of railroad companies to their employ6s
injured while engaged in interstate commerce," and that
it is "paramount and exclusive"; in North CarolinaR. R.
Co. v. Zachary, 232 U. S. 248, 256, it is held that where
it appears that the injury occurred while the carrier was
engaged and the employee employed in interstate commerce the federal act governs to the exclusion of the state
law; in Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Horton, supra, pp. 501,
503, it is said not only that Congress intended "to exclude
responsibility of the carrier to its employ6s" in the
absence of negligence, but that it is not conceivable that
Congress" intended to permit the legislatures of the several
States to determine the effect of contributory negligence
and assumption of risk, by enacting statutes for the safety
of employ~s, since this would in effect relegate to state
control two of the essential factors that determine the
responsibility of the employer;" and in Wabash R. R. Co.
v. Hayes, 234 U. S. 86, 89, it is said: "Had the injury
occurred in interstate commerce, as was alleged, the Federal act undoubtedly would have been controlling and a
recovery could not have been had under the common or
statute law of the State; in other words, the Federal act
would have been exclusive in its operation, not merely
cumulative [citing cases]. On the other hand, if the injury occurred outside of interstate commerce, the Federal
act was without application and the law of the State was
controlling."
The act is entitled, "An Act Relating to the liability of
common carriers by railroad to their employees in certain
cases," and the suggestion is made that the words "in

NEW YORK CENTRAL R. R. CO.v. WINFIELD.
244 U. S.

153

Opinion of the Court.

certain cases" require that the act be restrictively construed. But we think these words are intended to do no
more than to bring the title into reasonable accord with
the body of the act, which discloses in exact terms that
it is not to embrace all cases of injury to the employees of
such carriers, but only such as occur while the carrier is
engaging and the employee is employed in "commerce
between any of the several States," etc. See Employer8'
Liability Cases, 207 U. S.463.
Only by disturbing the uniformity which the act is designed to secure and by departing from the principle which
it is intended to enforce can the several States require such
carriers to compensate their employees for injuries in
interstate commerce occurring without negligence. But
no State is at liberty thus to interfere with the operation
of a law of Congress. As before indicated, it is a mistake
to suppose that injuries occurring without negligence are
not reached or affected by the act, for, as is said in Prigg
v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539, 617, "if Congress have a
constitutional power to regulate a particular subject, and
they do actually regulate it in a given manner, and in a
certain form, it cannot be that the state legislatures have
a right to interfere, and, as it were, by way of complement
to the legislation of Congress, to prescribe additional
regulations, and what they may deem auxiliary provisions
for the same purpose. In such a case, the legislation of
Congress, in what it does prescribe, manifestly indicates
that it does not intend that there shall be any farther
legislation to act upon the subject-matter. Its silence as
to what it does not do, is as expressive of what its intention is as the direct provisions made by it." Thus the
act is as comprehensive of injuries occurring without
negligence, as to which class it impliedly excludes liability,
as it is of those as to which it imposes liability. In other
words, it is a regulation of the carriers' duty or obligation
as to both. And the reasons which operate to prevent the

States from dispensing with compensation where the act
requires it equally prevent them from requiring compensation where the act withholds or excludes it.
It follows that in the present case the award under the
state law cannot be sustained.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BRADEIs, dissenting.
I dissent from the opinion of the court; and the importance of the question involved induces me to state the
reasons.
By the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908,
Congress provided, in substance, that railroads engaged
in interstate commerce shall be liable in damages for their
negligence resulting in injury or death of employees while
so engaged. The majority of the court now holds that
by so doing Congress manifested its will to cover the
whole field of compensation or relief for injuries suffered
by railroad employees engaged in interstate commerce;
or, at least, the whole field of obligation of carriers relating
thereto; and that it thereby withdrew the subject wholly
from the domain of state action. In other words the
majority of the court declares, that Congress by passing
the Employers' Liability Act prohibited States from including within the protection of their general Workmen's
Compensation Laws employees who without fault on the
railroad'spart are injured or killed while engaged in interstate commerce; although Congress itself offered them no
protection. That Congress could have done this is clear.
The question presented is: Has Congress done so? Has
Congress so willed?
The Workmen's Compensation Law of New York here
in question has been declared by this court to be among
those which "bear so close a relation to the protection of
the lives and safety of those concerned that they properly

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

may be regarded as coming within the category of police
regulations." New York Central R. R. Co. v. White, 243
U. S. 188, 207. And this court has definitely formulated
the rules which should govern in determining when a
federal statute regulating commerce will be held to supersede state legislation in the exercise of the police power.
These rules are:
1. "In conferring upon Congress the regulation of commerce, it was never intended to cut the States off from
legislating on all subjects relating to the health, life, and
safety of their citizens, though the legislation might indirectly affect the commerce of the country." Sherlock
v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, 103.
2. "If the purpose of the act cannot otherwise be accomplished-if its operation within its chosen field else must
be frustrated and its provisions be refused their natural
effect-the state law must yield to regulation of Congress
within the sphere of its delegated power.
"But the intent to supersede the exercise by the State
of its police power as to matters not covered by the Federal legislation is not to be inferred from the mere fact
that Congress has seen fit to circumscribe its regulation
and to occupy a limited field. In other words, such intent
is not to be implied unless the act of Congress fairly interpreted is in actual conflict with the law of the State."
Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 533.
3. "The question must of course be determined with
reference to the settled rule that a statute enacted in
execution of a reserved power of the State is not to be
regarded as inconsistent with an act of Congress passed
in the execution of a clear power under the Constitution,
unless the repugnance or conflict is so direct and positive
that the two acts cannot be reconciled or stand together."
Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S.

The following cases show that Congress, in legislating upon a particular subject of interstate commerce, will not be held to have inhibited by implication the exercise by the States of their reserved
police power, unless such state action would actually frustrate or impair the intended operation of the federal legislation.
1. In Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S. 52, 62, it was held that the Federal
Food and Drugs Act, dealing, among other things with shipment in
interstate commerceof fruit in filthy, decomposed, or putrid condition,
did not prevent a State from penalizing the shipment of citrus fruits
"which are immature or otherwise unfit for consumption."
2. In Atlantic Coast Line R. R.Co. v. Georgia, 234 U. S.280, 293, it
was held that Congress did not, by the passage of the Federal Safety
Appliance Acts, dealing with the equipment of locomotives, as well as
of cars, and the Act to Regulate Commerce, preclude the States from
legislating concerning locomotive headlights, as to which Congress had
not specifically acted.
3. In Missouri,Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harris,234 U. S.412, 420,
it was held that the Carmack Amendment (34 Stat. 584, 595), regulating
the carrier's liability for loss of interstate shipments, did not prevent a
State from providing for the allowance of a moderate attorney's fee
in a statute applicable both in the case of interstate and intrastate
shipments.
4. In Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 529, it was held that the passage
by Congress of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, which, among other
things, prohibited misbranding, did not prevent the States from regulating the sale and requiring to be affixed a statement of ingredients
and minimum percentage of fat and proteins.
5. In Missouri Pacifid Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co., 211 U. S.
612, 623, it was held that Congress, by granting, in the Act to Regulate
Commerce, power to the Interstate Commerce Commission to compel
equal switching service on cars destined to interstate commerce, did
not, in the absence of the exercise by the Commission of its power,
prohibit States from legislating on the subject.
6. In Asbell v. Kansas, 209 U. S. 251, 257, 'it was held that Congress,
inproviding that a certificate of inspection issued by the National
Bureau of Animal Industry should entitle cattle to be shipped into any
State without further inspection, did not prevent a State from penalizing the importation of cattle which had not been inspected either by
the federal bureau or by designated state officials.

to prevent States from entering the specific field of compensation for injuries to employees arising without fault
7. In Crossman v. Lurman, 192 U. S. 189, 199, it was held that the
Act of Congress of August 30, 1890, 26 Stat. 414, prohibiting importation into the United States of adulterated and unwholesome food, did
not prevent the States from legislating for the prevention of the sale
of articles of food so adulterated, as come within valid prohibitions of
their statutes.
8. In Reid v. Colorado, 187 U. S. 137, 149, it was held that Congress,
by making it an offence under the Animal Industry Act for anyone to
send from State to State cattle known tobe affeoted with communicable
disease, did not prevent the States from penalizing the importation of
cattle without inspection by designated state officials.
9. In Missouri,Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Haber, 169 U. S. 613, 623,
it was held that the Federal Animal Industry Act, making it a misdemeanor for any person or corporation to transport cattle known to be
affected with contagious disease, did not prevent a State from imposing
a civil liability for damages sustained by owners of domestic cattle by
reason of the importation of such diseased cattle.
10. In Smith v. Alabama, 124 U. S. 465, 482, it was held that Congress did not, by the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce, prohibit the States from enacting laws requiring persons to undergo examination before being permitted to act as locomotive engineers.
11. In Sherlock v. Alling, 93 U. S. 99, it was held that Congress did
not, by the passage of many laws regulating navigation, with a view to
safety, and providing for liability in certain cases, prohibit the application to an accident in navigable waters of a State of a statute providing
for liability for wrongful death.
The following cases, holding that the Federal Employers' Liability
Act supersedes the common or statutory laws of the States relating to
the liability of railroads for negligent injuries to their employees while
engaged in interstate commerce, are, of course, wholly consistent witb
the cases above referred to, the "field" of both federal and state laws
there under consideration being identical: Second Employers' Liability

on the. railroad'spart, for which Congress made no provision.
To ascertain the intent we must look, of course, first
at what Congress has said; then at the action it has taken,
or omitted to take. We look at the words of the statute
to see whether Congress has used any, which in terms
express that will. We enquire whether, without the use
of explicit words, that will is expressed in specific action
taken. For Congress must be presumed to have intended
the necessary consequences of its action. And if we find
that its will is not expressed, or is not clearly expressed,
either in words or by specific action, we should look at the
circumstances under which the Employers' Liability Act
was passed; look, on the one hand, at its origin, .scope and
purpose; and, on the other, at the nature, methods and
means of state Workmen's Compensation Laws. If the
will is not clearly expressed in words we must consider
all these in order to determine what Congress intended.
First-As to words used: The act contains no words
expressing a will by Congress to cover the whole field of
compensation or relief for injuries received by or for death
of such employees while engaged in interstate commerce;
or the whole field of carriers' obligations in relation thereto.
The language of the act, so far as it indicates anything in
this respect, points to just the contrary. For its title is:
"An Act Relating to the liability of common carriers by
railroad to their employees in certain cases." 1
Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Ry. Co. v. Craft, 237 U. S. 648;
Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Devine, 239 U. S.52, 54;

1The title of this act may be profitably compared with that of the
bill (not enacted) prepared by the Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Commission pursuant to Joint Resolution No. 41,
approved June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 884, proposing a Federal Workmen's
Compensation Law, which reads: "A bill to provide an exclusive remedy

Second-As to specific action taken: The power exercised by Congress is not such that, when exercised, it necessarily excludes the state action here under consideration.
It would obviously have been possible for Congress to
provide in terms, that wherever such injuries or death
result from the railroad's negligence, the remedy should
be sought by action for damages; and wherever injury
or death results from causes other than the railroad's
negligence, compensation may be sought under the Workmen's Compensation Laws of the States. Between the
federal and the state law there would be no conflict whatsoever. They would, on the contrary, be complementary.
Third-As to origin, purpose and scope of the Employers' Liability Act and the nature, methods and means
of state Workmen's Compensation Laws: The facts are
of common knowledge. Do they manifest that, by entering
upon one section of the field of indemnity or relief for
injuries or death suffered by employees engaged in interstate commerce, Congress purposed to occupy the whole
field?
(A) The origin of the Federal Employers' Liability Act:
By the common law as administered in the several
States, the employee, like every other member of the
community, was expected to bear the risks necessarily
attendant upon life and work; subject only to the right
to be indemnified for any loss inflicted by wrongdoers.
The employer, like every other member of the community,
was in theory liable to all others for loss resulting from
his wrongs; the scope of his liability for wrongs being
amplified by the doctrine of respondeat superior. This
legal liability, which in theory applied between employer
and employee as well as between others, came, in course of
and compensation for accidental injuries resulting in disability or death,
to employees of common carriers by railroad engaged in interstate or
foreign commerce, or in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes." Sen. Doc. 338, p. 107, 62d Cong. 2d sess.

time, to be seriously impaired in practice. The protection
it provided employees seemed to wane as the need for it
grew. Three defenses-the doctrines of'fellow servant's
negligence, of assumption of risk and of contributory negligence-rose and flourished. When applied to huge organizations and hazardous occupations, as in railroading, they
practically abolished the liability of employers to employees; and in so doing they worked great hardship and
apparent injustice. The wrongs suffered were flagrant;
the demand for redress insistent; and the efforts to secure
remedial legislation widespread. But the opponents were
alert, potent and securely entrenched. The evils of the
fellow-servant rule as applied to railroads were recognized
as early as 1856, when Georgia passed the first law abolishing the defense. Between the passage of that act and the
passage of the first Federal Employers' Liability Act
(Act of June 11, 1906, 34 Stat. 232), fifty years elapsed.
In those fifty years only four more States had wholly
abolished the defense of fellow servant's negligence. Furthermore, in only one State had a statute been passed
making recovery possible, where the employee had been
guilty of contributory negligence.' Meanwhile, the numIAt the time the first Federal Employers'- Liability Act was passed
the so-called common law defenses remained in force, in large part, in
most of the States, as to railroad employees.
A. The Fellow Servant Rule. (See Compilation of Statutes in
"Liability of Employers," Senate Hearings, 1906, pp. 183-288; and
in Senate Document No. 207, 60th Congress, 1st sess.)
(1) It had been completely abolished as to railroad employees
in only 5 States: Georgia (1856), Kansas (1874), North Carolina
(1897), Colorado (1901), North Dakota (1903).
(2) It remained in full force, or substantially so, in 25 States or
Territories: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho,
Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Maryland,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee,

ber of accidents to railroad employees had become appalling. In the year 1905-6 the number killed while on duty
was 3,807, and the number injured 55,524.1 The promoters of remedial action, unable to overcome the efficient opposition presented in the legislatures of the several
States, sought And secured the powerful support of the
President.2 Congress was appealed to and used its power
(3) In 16 other States it had been modified; abolished either as
to certain more dangerous kinds of work, or as to certain classes of
employees: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Oregon,
South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin.
(4) The passage of the first federal act immediately stimulated
further state legislation. In 1907 the fellow-servant rule was
abolished as to railroads in Arkansas, Nevada, Oklahoma, South
Dakota; and largely in California, Nebraska, Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin.
B. Contributory Negligence. (See compilations cited, supra.)
(1) In all but 1 State there had been no statutory change of the
rule that contributory negligence constituted a complete defense.
Georgia (1895) had substituted the comparative negligence doctrine. In Kansas and Illinois early cases at common law seeming
to apply this doctrine had been repudiated. The common law of
Tennessee also contained some traces of the doctrine.
(2) During the year following the passage of the f&st federal
act, which adopted the rule of comparative negligence, with mitigation of damages proportionate to the degree of plaintiff's negligence, several States introduced this modification: Nebraska,
Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin.
C. Assumption of Risk. (See the compilations cited, supra.)
The harshness of this rule had been mitigated by statute or
other statutory action taken in only 14 States: Alabama, California, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina,
Texas, Virginia. In 1907 Iowa abolished the rule as to employees
giving notice of a known defect.

over interstate commerce to afford relief. The promotion

of safety was of course referred to in the Committee's
report as justifying congressional action; but the moving
cause for the Federal Employers' Liability Act was not
the desire to promote safety or to secure uniformity, as in
standardizing equipment by the Safety Appliance Acts.'
There was, in the nature of things, no more reason for
providing a federal remedy for negligent injury to employees than there would have been for providing such a
remedy for negligent injury to passengers or to other members of the public. The Federal Employers' Liability Act
was, in a sense, emergency legislation. The circumstances
following facts are significant as showing that employers'
liability was not deemed a factor in safety to employees or the public,
or a matter in which uniformity was desirable, or as otherwise presenting a railroad problem:
(1) The Annual Reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission
to Congress for the eleven years ending December, 1908, deal each
year at large with accidents, casualties to employees, and the promotion of safety. These reports contain numerous recommendations
for legislation concerning safety appliances, hours of labor, block
signals, train control, inspection and accident reporting; but no
recommendation or even mention of employers' liability.
(2) The National Convention of Railroad' Commissioners, an
association comprising the commissioners of the several States, is
formed for the purpose of discussing and aiding in the solution of
American railroad problems. Likewise, in its reports for eleven years
ending October, 1908, no reference has been found, either in the
annual President's address, or in the report of the Committee on
Legislation, or in the discussions, to the subject of employers' liability; or any mention of the passage by Congress of the two Employers'
Liability Acts, or of the decision of this court on the first act.
The absence of such reference is particularly noteworthy in the
legislative report for the year 1908, pp. 218-233, which is devoted to
a consideration of harmonious or uniform legislation. It contains a
r6sum6 of the legislation in Congress recommended and supported
by the National Convention of Railroad Commissioners during a
period of 19 years and attendances at congressional hearings on
safety appliances, block signal, and hours of labor legislation.

attending its passage were such as to preclude the belief,
that thereby Congress intended ,todeny to the States the
power to provide for compensation or relief for injuries
not covered by it.
(B) The scope of the FederalEmployers' iiability Act:
(1.) The act leaves uncovered a large part of the injuries which result from the railroads' negligence. The
decision of this court in the first Employers' Liability
Cases, 207 U. S. 463, had declared that Congress lacked
power to legislate in respect to any injuries occurring
otherwise than to employees engaged in interstate commerce. Later decisions disclose how large a part of the
injuries resulting from the railroads' negligence are thus
excluded from the operation of the federal law. For the
act was held to apply only to those directly engaged in
interstate commerce. This excludes not only those engaged in intrastate commerce, but also the many whowhile engaged on work for interstate commerce, as in
repairing engines or cars-are not directly engaged in it.
Likewise it excludes employees who, though habitually
engaged directly in interstate commerce, happen to be
injured or killed through the railroads' negligence, while
performing some work in intrastate commerce. 1
(2.) The act leaves uncovered all of the injuries which.
result otherwise than from the railroad's negligence,
though occurring when the employee is engaged directly
in interstate commerce.
The scope of the act is so narrow as to preclude the be- lief that thereby Congress intended to deny to the States

the power to provide compensation or relief for injuries
not covered by it.
(C) The purpose of the Employers' Liaility Act:
The facts showing the origin and scope of the act discussed above indicate also its purpose. It was to end
the denial of the right to damages for injuries due to the
railroads' negligence-a right denied under judicial decisions through the interposition of the defenses of fellowservant, assumption of risk and contributory negligence.
It was not the purpose of the act to deny to the States the
power to grant the wholly new right to protection or relief
in the case of injuries suffered otherwise than through
fault of the railroads.
The Federal Employers' Liability Act was, in no respect,
a departure from the individualistic basis of right arid of
liability. It was, on the contrary, an attempt to enforce
truly and impartially the old conception of justice as between individuals. The common-law liability for fault
was to be restored by removing the abuses which prevented
its full and just operation. The liability of the employer,
under the federal act as at common law, is merely a
penalty for wrong doing. The remedy assured to the
employee is merely a more efficient means of making the
wrongdoer indemnify him whom he has wronged. This
limited purpose of the Employers' Liability Act precludes
the belief that Congress intended thereby to deny to
the States the power to provide compensation. or relief
for injuries not covered by the act.
(D) The nature of Workmen's Compensation Acts:
In the effort to remove abuses, a study had been made
of facts; and of the world's experience in dealing with industrial accidents. That study uncovered as fiction many
an assumption upon which American judges and lawyers
had rested comfortably. The conviction became widespread, that our individualistic conception of rights and
liability no longer furnished an adequate basis for dealing

BRANDEIS,

with accidents in industry. It was seen that no system
of indemnity dependent upon, fault oil the employers'
part could meet the situation; even if the law were perfected and its administration made exemplary. For in
probably a majority of cases of injury there was no assignable fault; and in many more it must be impossible of
proof. It was urged: Attention should be directed, not
to the employer's fault, but to the employee's misfortune.
Compensation should be general, not sporadic; certain,
not conjectural; speedy, not delayed; definite as to amount
and time of payment; and so distributed over long periods
as to insure actual protection against- lost or lessened
earning capacity. To a system making such provision,
and not to wasteful litigation, dependent for success upon
the coincidence of fault and the ability to prove it, society,
as well as the individual employee and his dependents,
must look for adequate protection. Society needs such
a protection as much as the individual; because ultimately
society must bear the burden, financial and otherwise, of
the heavy losses which accidents entail. And since accidents are a natural, and in part an inevitable, concomitant of industry as now practiced, society, which is served
thereby, should in some way provide the protection. To
attain this end, co6perative methods must be pursued;
some form of insurance-that is, some form of taxation.
Such was the contention which has generally prevailed.
Thus out of the attempt to enforce individual justice,
grew the attempt to do social justice. But when Congress passed the Employers' Liability Act of April 22,
1908, these truths had gained little recognition in the
'Jnited States. Not one of the thirty-seven States or
Territories which now have Workmen's Compensation
Laws had introduced the system. Yet the conception
and value of compensation laws was not unknown to
Congress. It then had under consideration the first Compensation Law for Federal Employees which was enacted

in the following month (Act of May 30, 1908, 35 Stat.
556). The need of its speedy passage had been calledto the attention of Congress by the President in the same
special message which urged the passage of this Employers' Liability Act.
Can it be contended that Congress by simply passing
the Employers' Liability Act prohibited the States from
providing in any way for the maintenance of such employees (and their dependents) for whose injuries a railroad, innocent of all fault, could not be called -uponto make
indemnity under that act? It is the State which is both
primarily and ultimately concerned with the care of the
injured and of those dependent upon him; even though
the accident may occur while the employee is engaged
directly in interstate commerce. Upon the State falls the
financial burden of dependency, if, provision be not otherwise made. Upon the State falls directly the far heavier
burden of the demoralization of its citizenry, and of the
social unrest, which attend destitution and the denial of
opportunity. Upon the State also rests under our dual
system of government the duty owed to the individual
to avert misery and promote happiness so far as possible.
Surely we may not impute to Congress the will to deny
to the States the power to perform either this duty to
humanity or their fundamental duty of self-preservation.
And if the States are left free to provide compensation,
what is there in the Employers' Liability Act to show an
intent on the part of Congress to deny to them the power
to make the provision by raising the necessary contributions, in the first instance, through employers?
(E) Methods and means of Workmen's Compensation
Laws:
The principle underlying Workmen's Compensation
Laws is the same in all the States. The methods and
means by which that principle is carried out vary mate
rially. The principle is that of insurance, the premiums

BRANDEIS,

J., dissenting.

to which are contributed by employers generally. How
the insurance fund shall be raised and administered; what
the scale of compensation or relief shall be; how the contributing groups of employers shall be formed; whether
or not a state fund shall be created; whether the individual
employer shall be permitted to become a self-insurer;
whether he shall be permitted to deal directly with the
employee in making settlement of the compensation to be
awarded; on all these questions the laws of the several
States do and properly may differ radically.
What methods and means the State shall adopt in order
to provide compensation for injuries to citizens or residents
where Congress has left it free to legislate, rests (subject
to constitutional limitations) wholly within the judgment
of the State. It might conclude, in view of the hazard
involved, that no one should engage in the occupation of
railroading without providing against the financial consequences of accidents through contributing an adequate
amount to an accident insurance fund. It might conclude that it was wise to make itself the necessary contributions to such a fund, out of monies raised from general
taxation. Or it might conclude, as the State of Washington did, that the fairest and wisest form of taxation for
the purpose was to impose upon the employer directly
the duty of making the required contributions-relying
upon the laws of trade to effect, through the medium of
transportation charges, an equitable distribution of the
burden. The method last suggested is pursued in substance also by the State of New York. In its essence the
laws of the States are the same in this respect, as is shown
in Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219. It
is misleading to speak of the new obligation of the employer to contribute to compensation for injuries to workmen as an increase of the."employer's liability." It is not
a liability for a violation of a duty. It is a direct-a
primary-obligation in the nature of a tax. And the right

of the employee is as free from any suggestion of wrong
done to him as the new right granted by Mothers' Pension Laws.
(F) Federal and State legislation are not in conflict.
The practical difficulty of determining in a particular
case, according to presence or absence of railroad fault,
whether indemnity is to be sought under the Federal
Employers' Liability Act or under a state compensation
law-affords, of course, no reason for imputing to Congress
the will to deny to the States power to afford relief through
such a system. The difficulty and uncertainty is, at
worst, no greater than that which now exists in so many
cases where it is necessary to determine whether the employee was, at the time of the accident, engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce. 1 Expedients for minimizing
inherent difficulties will doubtless be found by experience.
All the difficulties may conceivably be overcome in practice. Or they may prove so great as to lead Congress
to repeal the Federal Employers' Liability Act and leave
to the States (which alone can deal comprehensively
with it) the whole subject of indemnity and compensation for injuries to employees whether engaged in interstate or intrastate commerce, and whether such
injuries arise from negligence or without fault of the
employer.
We are admonished also by another weighty consideration not to impute to Congress the will to deny to the
States this power. The subject of compensation for

number of cases on the October 1915 term of this court was
1069. Of these 93 involved one or more questions arising under the
Federal Employeir' Liability Act of April 22, 1908. Of these 93 cases,
37 presented the question whether or not the employee was engaged in
interstate commerce or intrastate commerce. In 52 of the cases the
question was presented whether there was evidence of negligence on the
part of defendant. In 24 of the cases the question was also presented
whether or not the employee had assumed the risk.

accidents in industry, is one peculiarly appropriate for
state legislation. There must, necessarily, be great diversity in the conditions of living and in the needs. of the injured and of his dependents, according to whether they
reside in one or the other of our States and Territories, so
widely extended. In a large majority of instances they
reside in the State in which the accident occurs. Though
the principle that compensation should be made, or relief
given, is of universal application, the great diversity of
conditions in the different sections of the United States
may, in a wise application of the principle, call for differences between States, in the amount and method of
compensation, the periods in which payment shall be
made, and the methods and means by which the funds
shall be raised and distributed. The field of compensation for injuries appears to be one in which uniformity is
not desirable, or at least not essential to the public welfare.
The contention that Congress has, by legislating on one
branch of a subject relative to interstate commerce,
preempted the whole field-has been made often in this
court; and, as the cases above cited show, has been repeatedly rejected in cases where the will of Congress to
leave the balance of the field open to. state, action was far
less clear than under the circumstances here considered.
Tested by those decisions and by the rules which this court
has framed for its guidance, I am of opinion, as was said
in Atlantic Coast Line R. R. Co. v. Georgia, 234 U. S. 280,
294, that: "The intent to supersede the exercise of the
State's police power with respect to this subject cannot
be inferred from the restricted action which thus far has
been taken. ' The field covered by Congress was a limited
field of the carrier's liability for negligence, not the whole
field of the carrier's, obligation arising from accidents. I
find no justification for imputing to Congress the will to
deny to a large class of persons engaged in a necessarily
