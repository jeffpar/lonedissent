Syllabus.

tween the New York Workmen's Compensation Act and
the acts of Congress for limiting the liability of shipowners (Rev. Stats., §§ 4283-5; Act of June 26, 1884, c. 121,
§ 18, 23 Stat. 53, 57). So long as the aggregate liabilities
of the owner, including that under the New York law,
do not amount to as much as the interest of the owner
in the vessel and freight pending, the act of Congress does
not come into play. Where it does apply, it reduces all
liabilities proportionally, under whatever law arising;

the liability under the New York law along with the others.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Norman B. Beecher, with whom Mr. Ray Rood
Allen was on the briefs, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. E. Clarence Aiken, with whom Mr. Egburt E. Woodbury, Attorney General of the State of New York, and
Mr. Harold J. Hinman were on the brief, for defendant in
error.
MR. JUSTICE MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the
court.
Purporting to proceed under the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York (c. 67, Consolidated Laws), the
State Commission, on September 3, 1914, made an award
to defendant in error, Walker.
It found:
"1. William Alfred Walker, a claimant, is a longshoreman, residing at 151 West 133rd Street, New York City.
Prior to July 1, 1914, he was employed in the City of New
York by the Clyde Steamship Company for longshore
work. He was injured on July 1, 1914, while in the employ
of the Clyde Steamship Company as a longshoreman.
"2. The Clyde Steamship Company is a corporation
organized and existing under the Laws of Maine, where it
has its principal office. It also has an office at Pier 36
North River.
"3. During the discharge of the Cherokee and at the
time of the accident, the claimant was on board the steamship Cherokee, owned and operated by the Clyde Steamship Company. During the year prior to the accident,
Walker .had been employed from time to time by the
Clyde Steamship Company and could have been assigned
to work upon the pier. .The Cherokee was, at the time
of the accident, moored to and alongside Pier 37, North

River, New York City, lying in navigable waters of the
Hudson River. Said pier is leased by Clyde Steamship
Company from the City of New York.
"4. While claimant was hooking the rope of a derrick
into a load of lumber in the between decks of said vessel
for the purpose of unloading it from that vessel, his hand
was jammed against the lumber, resulting in laceration
of the second finger of the left hand. Claimant was disabled by reason of the injury from July 1, 1914, to July 22,
1914, returning to work upon the latter date.
"5. The business of the Clyde Steamship Com.pany in
this state consists solely of carrying passengers and merchandise to New York from other states and carrying
passengers and merchandise from New York to other
states. All cargo on board the Cherokee, including the
lumber aforesaid, had been taken on board in the State
of North Carolina and carried by water to New York and
was there unloaded from the steamship Cherokee. The
claimant was engaged solely in handling said lumber.
"6. The injury was an accidental injury and arose out
of and in the course of the employment of claimant by the
Clyde Steamship Company. The injury did not result
solely from the intoxication of the injured employee while
on duty, and was not occasioned by the wilful intention
of the injured employee to bring about the injury or death
of himself or another.
"7. The average weekly wage of claimant was $17.30."
Without opinion the Appellate Division affirmed the
award, and this action was approveP by the Court of
Appeals. 215 N. Y. 529.
In Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, just decided,
ante, 205, we considered and disposed of the fundamental
question here involved. The legislature exceeded its
authority in attempting to extend the statute to conditions like those which the record discloses.
The judgment of the court below must be reversed and
