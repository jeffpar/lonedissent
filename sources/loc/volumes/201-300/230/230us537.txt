SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY AND OREGON &
CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMPANY v. CAMP-BELL ET AL., CONSTITUTING THE RAILROAD
COMMISSION OF OREGON.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON.
No. 428. Argued, April 9, 1912.-Decided June 16, 1913.
The enforcement of an oider of the State Railroad Commission prescribing rates of intrastate transportation will not be restrained at
the instance of a carrier on the ground that the rates are confiscatory
where the allegations of the bill are insufficient to show that the
.carrier would be deprived of just compensation in the business of
intrastate transportation by virtue of the operation of the order.
A,general charter provision, giving power to charge and collect tolls,
necessarily implies that the charges shall be reasonable, and does
not detract from the power of the State to prescribe reasonable rates.
The court should only override the decision of the 40dy which has been
given legislative authority to establish rates of transportation where
the action of such body is of such an arbitrary character as to constitute an abuse of powers.
This court follows the decision of the state court as to the constitutionality of a state statute conferring power on a Railroad Commission to establish intrastate rates.
Penal provisions of a state statute regulating railroad rates which are
separable furnish no ground for the courts denying effect to the
rates if the statute is otherwise valid.
189 Fed. Rep. 182, affirmed.
THE facts, which involve the constitutionality of an
order of the Railroad Commission of Oregon of Septem-ber 21, 1910, prescribing railroad freight rates, are stated
in the opinion.

Remote or indirect interference with interstate commerce by State is not inhibited by Federal Constitution.
Congress is without authority directly to regulate the
purely internal commerce of the States. See authorities
cited in brief in preceding case, p. 525, ante.
The Interstate Commerce Commission had declined
to assume jurisdiction of commerce which begins and ends
in a single State, even when it appeared that the local
rates touched upon or interfered with interstate commerce.

MR. JusncE' HUGHES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court
entered July 18, 1911, dismissing the bill, on demurreri
for want of equity. 189 Fed. Rep. 182.
The bill was filed by the complainants, the Southern
Pacific Company and the Oregon & California Railroad
Company, to set aside an order made by the Railroad
Commission of Oregon under date of September 21, 1910,
and to enjoin the defendants, the members of the commission and the Attorney-General of the State, from enforcing it. By this order, the comimission found, after
hearing, that certain freight rates maintained by the
Southern Pacific Company between Portland and other
places on its lines in Oregon were unreasonable- excessive
and discriminatory, and the commission required the
company, in lieu of the rates thus disapproved, to put
into effect the "just and reasonable and non-disc.riminatory
charges" set forth in the order.
The first, and principal, contention of the appellants, is
that this requirement was invalid as constituting a regula,tion of interstate commerce. The order, however, related
solely to intrastate traffic, and the question raised by the
bill, so far as its allegations bear upon the conditions of
interstate transportation, does not differ in its essential
features from that which was passed upon in the Minnesota
rate cases. Minnesota Rate Cases, ante, p. 352. This ob,
jection to the order cannot be sustained.
It is further insisted that the order was confiscatory.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

The railroad property in question was that of the Oregon
& California Railroad Company which was operated by
the Southern Pacific Company under lease made in 1887.
It was provided by the lease that the Southern Pacific
Company should keep the property in good condition,
"operate, maintain, add to, and better the same at its
own expense," and should pay over annually to the lessor
company the amount remaining of the net earnings, after
all charges and expenses incurred by the Southern Pacific
Company under the lease, and all taxes and interest,
current fixed charges and all indebtedness of the lessor to
the Southern Pacific Company, had been paid, save that
if such amount should exceed specified percentages of the
preferred and common stock of the lessor, the excess might
be retained by the lessee.
It was alleged that after payment of operating expenses,
taxes, interest, and other reasonable and legitimate
expenses, a deficit had accumulated representing an
indebtedness to the Southern Pacific Company and
amounting on June 30, 1906, to the sum of $6,222,037;
but it also appeared that this deficit was reduced in the
following years so that on June 30, 1909, it amounted to
$3,207,008.37.
The capital stock consisted of preferred stock of the par
value of $12,000,000, and common stock of the par value
of $7,000,000, and the bonded indebtedness amounted to
$17,745,000, making in the aggregate $36,745,000. In
one part of the bill it was alleged, without particulars,
showing the constituent items, that the total value of
the property in Oregon, held under the lease, consisting
of approximately 670 miles of road with rolling stock,
stations, terminals and appurtenances, amounted to
$43,594,886.73. But a later averment, in connection with
the allegations as to outlays and return, was that "the
properties ofithe Oregon & California Railroad Company
are of the reasonable value of. a sum representing the out-

standing bonded indebtedness and the deficit, as aforesaid
and the capital stock of the company"; and so valued, the
total would be $39,952,008.37.
The receipts from the entire property and the disbursements for several years were stated.. It was averred that
for the fiscal-year ending June 30, 1909, the total receipts
were $7,104,081 and the disbursements, $5,839,698. As
the court below pointed out, the bill was silent as to what
was embraced in the aggregate expenditures, and the
court thought it fair to assume tJat the total disbursements, as alleged, included not only the expenses of operation, but also interest on bonds and on open accounts and
thus, that the averment showed, for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1909, a net balance of $1,264,383 as a return on
the investment represented by $19,000,000 in par value of
capital stock. It was alleged that the "annual loss of
interstate and intrastate business combined," which would
result if the order in question were enforced, would amount
to $156,072.48. The court below concluded that on this
showing it could not be said in advance of actual experience, that the rates fixed by the commission would not
afford a fair return upon the value of the property.
The order, as already noted, Was made in September,
1910, and the bill was brought in October, 1910, but the
receipts and disbursements for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1910, were not given. In addition to this omission, the bill was destitute of any allegation showing the
expenses incurred in the conduct of the intrastate business
as distinguished from the interstate business, or the share
of the value of the property which was assignable to the
former. In short, the allegations of the bill were wholly
insufficient to show that the complainants would be
deprived of just compensation in their business of intrastate transportation by virtue of the operation of the
order.
In sustaining the demurrer, the court gave to the com-

plainants thirty days in which to plead further; and they
thus had opportunity for amending their bill so as to
present additional averments which would correct deficiencids in the original allegations and remove any
possible misapprehension as to the facts intended to beset forth. But the complainants informed the court
that they did not desire to avail themselves of this Opportunity and accordingly the bill was dismissed. We
think that it cannot be said that any error was cornmitted in thus disposing of the contention as to confiscation.
It is also urged that the railroad commission act (f
Oregon (February 18, 1907 Laws Of 1907, chap. 53, p. 67),
and the order in question, were void as against the Oregon
& California Railroad Company, and the lessee of its
propeuty, upon the ground that the act and order impaired
the obligation of the contract contained in the charter of
the first-mentioned company. That company was incorporated in 1870, under the general incorporation act of
Oregon, approved October 14, 1862, which, in §34, provided: "Every corporation formed under this act for
the construction of a railroad, as to such road shall be
deemed common carriers, and shall have power to collect
and receive such tolls or freight for transportation of
persons or property thereon as it may prescribe." Reference is also made to the following provision of the constitution of Oregon pursuant to which this incorporation act
was enacted: "Corporations may be formed under general
laws, but shall not be created by special laws except for
municipal purposes. All laws passed pursuant to this
section may be altered,. amended or repealed but not
so as to alter or destroy any vesied corporate rights."
(Art. Xi, § 2.)' The sole question.presented on this branch
of the case, it is said by counsel for the appellants, "is
whether the judgment of the carrier in fixing rates for
transportatidn of persons or property shall be supervised,

Opinion of the Court.

regulated ard supplanted by the judgment of the State

exercised through a Railroad Commission, or shall it
remain as it was at common law, within the exclusive
power and jurisdiction of the carrier to fix these rates,
subject only to the power of the courts upon judicial
inquiry, to denounce and decline to enforce rates that are
excessive and unreasonable?"
As to this question, it is sufficient to say that it is well
established that a general charter provision such as the
one quoted, giving power to charge and collect tolls, necessarily implies that the charges shall be reasonable and
does not detract from the power of the State through its
legislature, or the agency lawfully constituted thereby,
to prescribe reasonable rates to be observed by the carrier. State v. Southern Pacific Co., 23 Oregon, 424, 432,
433; Stone v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co,, 116 U. S. 307,
330; Dow v. Beidelman, 125 U. S.680, 688; Georgia R.R. &
Banking Co. v. Smith, 128 U. S. 174, 181; Chicago, M. &
St. P. Railway Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S.418, 455; CoVington & C. Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, 154 U. S. 204, 215;
Louisville & Nashville Railroad v. Kentucky, 161 U. S.
677, 696; Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co., 191
U. S. 358, 370. In the case of Stone v. Farmers' Loan-&
Trust Co., supra, where the charter empowered the railroad company "from time to time to fix, regulate, and
receive the toll and charges' by them to" b& received for
transportation of persons or property on their railroad,"
and it was insisted that a subsequent statute creating a
railroad commission with authority to fix maximum rates
was an impairment of contract obligation, the court said
(p. 330): "The claim now is that by § 12" (the provision
referred to) "the State has surrendered the power to fix
a maximum for this company, and has declared that the
courts shall be left to determine what is reasonable, free
of all legislative control. We see no evidence of any such
intention. Power is crant ed to fix reasonable charges,

Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

but what shall be deemed reasonable in law is nowhere
indicated. . . . Consequently, all the power which
the State had in the matter before the charter itretained
afterwards. The power to charge being coupled with
the condition that the charge shall be reasonable, the
State is left free to'act on the subject of reasonableness
within the limits of its general authority as circumstances
may require. The right to fix reasonable charges has been
granted, but the power of declaring what shall be deemed
reasonable has not been surrendered."
The remaining questions may be briefly disposed of.
The complainants were not entitled to have the court
below substitute its judgment for that of the commission
or determine the matters which properly fell within the
province of that body. The conditions of traffic, the
adjustment of rates with respect to the different commodities transported, and the appropriate basis for classification, were subjects for the consideration of the commission, and there was nothing shown which would have
warranted the court in overriding the decision of the
commission upon the ground that its action was; of such
an arbitrary character as to constitute an abuse of
power.
The criticism made in the bill that the railroad commission act violated the state constitution in conferring
upon the commission authority to exercise legislative,
executive and judicial powers, has been answered by the
decision of the state court, sustaining the statute. State v.
Corvallis & Eastern R. R. Co., 59 Oregon, 450; 117 Pac.
Rep. 980. The provision of the statute that suit might
be brought in the state court to set aside orders of the
commission upon the ground that the rates fixed were
unlawful, or that the regulation or practice prescribed
was unreasonable, did not infringe the rights of the complainants. The procedure permitted by the statute is
consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. Portland
