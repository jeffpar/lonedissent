JACKSON v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 720.

Submitted January 10, 1913.-Decided June 16, 1913.

This court considers it a grave error for the court charged with the
duty of making findings of fact to include mere conclusions of law.

Statements as to what the relation of the United States is to levee work
on the Mississippi River and what the pow6r of the Mississippi River
Commission over all such work is by whomsoever performed are conclusions of law and not of fact..
Congress did not, by the creation of the Mississippi River CoMAmission,
assume entire control of the levee work to the displacement of state
or local authorities who continued to construct levees for protec-

tion from overflow which combined with those constructed by the
United States for improvement of navigation, so that eventually a
..complete system would be evolved.
Damages, if any, by overflowing adjacent lands, occasioned by the
levee system of the Mississippi River Valley could only result from
concurrent. action of the United' States, the, States and their subordinate agencies and individuals all impelled by different considerations, but all working towards the common end of having an efficient
and continuous line of levees.

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

An individual owner has no right to insist that primitive conditions be
suffered to remain and thus all progress and development be rendered
impossible.
An individual owner protecting his own property from a commonnatural danger acquires no right thereby to insist that other owners
or the Government shall adopt the same method br that they
shall not adopt different methods for the protection of their respective properties or for the public good.
The United States is not responsible for damages by overflow or for
failure to construct additional levees along the Mississippi River
Valley, so as to afford increased protection from increased overflow
caused by the levees that were constructed by state and Federal authority at other points; nor do such damages amount to taking the
land overflowed for public use within the meaning of the Fifth
Amendment.
The rule that the United States has plenary power to legislate for the
benefit of navigation and is not liable for remote or consequential
damages causad by works constructed to that end has already been
directly applied to the work of the Mississippi River Commission.
Bedford v. United States, 192 U. S. 225.

THnE facts, which involve the question of liability of the
United States for damages alleged to have been sustained
by the owner of a plantation in the Mississippi River
Valley by reason of the improvement of the Mississippi
River under direction of the Federal Commission charged
with that work, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Waitman H. Conaway for appellants.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General John Q. Thompson and
Mr. J. Harwood Graves for the United States.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the
court.

This suit was brought to recover from the United States
the value of property asserted to have been totally de-

stroyed or rendered completely valueless as the result of

JACKSON v. UNITED STATES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

certain public work "done in pursuance of the acts of
Congress authorizing it, for the public benefit, under the
direction of the Mississippi River Commission and the
Secretary of War and the United States engineers." And
it was charged that under the circumstances stated and
the facts alleged, the property had- been taken by the
United States for public use "within the meaning of the
constitutional provision," and it was averred that, 'there
was consequently imposed "on the United States an implied obligation to make compensation for the property
so taken and destroyed."
It becomes necessary to give a brief description of the
topography of the country in which the property in question is situated, in order to make clear its relation to the
public work which it is asserted constituted a taking Within
the meaning of the Constitution.
The Valley of the Mississippi River, may in a broad
sense be said to commence at Cape Girardeau, Missouri,
and to extend from there to the mouth of the river at the
Gulf of Mexico. The river, however, in its course to the
ocean does not run through the center of the vast fert ile
and alluvial plains which in a comprehensive and g.neric
sense constitute the delta of the Mississippi. On the contrary the situation of the river in this respect varies, occasioned by the fact that at divers places the upland or hill
-country approaches to or constitutes the bank of the river.
The difference in this regard is marked between the west
and the east banks. The west bank is divided into four
great- basins the St. Franis Basin, which-extcnds froin
Cape Girardeau to Helena; the White .River Basin, which
extends from Helena to the mouth of the Arkansas; the
Tensas Basin, which extends from the mouth of the
Arkansas to the mouth of the Red River; and the Atehafalaya Basin, extending from the mouth of the Red River to
the Gulf. Practically in the long sweep from Ilelena,

begins, to the ending of the Atchafalaya Basin at the Gulf
there is no real topographical distinction between the
basins, the west bank of the river in that great distance
consisting of alluvial country having generally a very wide
though varying expanse. The division into basins putting
out of view the St. Francis Basin, is therefore merely the
result of a consideration of the watershed of each basin,
all the water, however, from each ultimately finding its
way to the Gulf of Mexico, either through the Mississippi.
River, or in the lower basins in part at least by the means
of streams flowing independently of the Mississippi River
to the Gulf of Mexico. On the east bank the situation is
different. In the long stretch from Cairo, Illinois, to a
point a short distance below Memphis, generally speaking,
the hills and uplands border the river and constitute its
bank. From the point below Memphis to which we have
referred to Vicksburg, Mississippi, this is not the case,
and there is a grpat basin known as the Yazoo Basin,
which, aside from peculiarities of its own, may be said to
possess the same general characteristics as the basins on
the west bank of the river. From Vicksburg where the
uplands come to the river and constitute its bank, down
to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where the hills or uplands permanently recede from the river a different condition from
that which exists on the west bank obtains. As we are
concerned only with the situation below Natchez we put
out of view any statement concerning the east bank between Vicksburg and Natchez, and refer only to the conditions'existing on the east bank between Natchez and
Baton Rouge.
From Natchez where the hills or uplands constitute the
bank of the river to Baton Rouge, the line of hill or upland
does not follow the course of the river, but recedes therefrom for a certain distance and then again abuts on the
river, this process being repeated from point to point
until Baton Rouge is reached. Of necessity therefore be--

Opinion of the Court.

tween the point of each departure of the uplands from the
river to the point of reapproach there is an area of alluvial
country bounded on the west by the river and constituting
its bank, on the east by the hills, which as it were like a
festoon or semicircle inclose the alluvial area between the
river, the base of the uplands or hills, and the points of
departure from and approach to the river as above stated.
These various areas constitute in the nature of things,
minor basins having their own watershed. And between
Natchez and Baton Rouge there are five of these minor
basins, one between Natchez and Ellis Cliffs, sixteen miles
below Natchez, another between Ellis Cliffs and Fort
Adams, thirty-nine miles below Ellis Cliffs, a third between Fort Adams and Tunica, seventeen miles below Fort
Adams, and two others between Tunica and Bayou Sara,
twenty-three miles below Tunica, and from Bayou Sara
to Baton Rouge, a distance of thirty-five miles. These
subordinate basins are included in a, general local levee
district known as the Homochitto district. A full and
accurate statement concerning these basins, of their relation to levee building, and overflow, will be found in Document No. 1010, House of Representatives, 63rd Congress,
third session, being a'letter of.the Secretary of War transmitting to the House of Representatives a full report of a
survey made by direction of Congress, by the Mississippi
River Commission, of these basins. Of the basin between
Ellis Cliffs and Fort Adams, the rePort of the Commission
makes the following statement:
"Between Ellis Cliffs and Fort Adams, a distance of
39 miles by river, lies a basin whose protection from floods
is greatly complicated by the presence of lakes, streams,
and swamps.
"It has a total area of 59,412 acres, including 9,781
acres of cleared and 49,631 acres of wooded land, the assessed value of which is $204,739.
"The systematic protection. of the basin as a whole is

impracticable without including drainage work of large
proportions.
"It will be observed that there is a large amount of
cleared land which is now being cultivated although
meagerly protected from floods by small private levees.
"Owing to the extent of swamp lands the cultivated
area could .not be greatly extended'by the construction of
a levee along the river front.
"The benefits to be derived from'the construction of a
levee are relatively small as compared with the cost, and
the work cannot be recommended."
In February, 1894, the appellants or their predecessors
in title for whom they have been substituted on the
record, filed their petition in the Court of Claims against
the United States, alleging themselves to be the owners
of various tracts of land in Adams County, Mississippi,
composing three plantations. It was alleged as follows:
"2. That before and prior to the year 1890 said plantation from its natural situation, was comparatively high
and exempt from overflow from the waters of the Mississippi river, except at long intervals, and the occurrence of
such overflows did ndt materially affect its productive
capacity, or its value.
"That said plantation was highly improved, well
stocked with laborers and tenants, yielded yearly large
crops of cotton, corn and other products, and was worth
the sum of fifty-thousand dollars.
"3. That about the year 1883 the officers and agents
of the United States, in pursuance of the act of Congress
creating the Mississippi River Commission, and of the
subsequent acts for the improvement of the navigation
of the Mississippi River, adopting the so-called Eads'
plan, projected, ,and have constructed, and are constructing,. a system of public works for the purpose of so confining the waters of .the river between lines of embankment,
or levees, as to Oive increased eleVation and velocity

and force to the current in order to scour and deepen the
channel, and have thus caused an increased and abnormal
elevation of at least four feet to the waters of the river
at the high water or flood stage; and for said purposes
have adopted and made use of systems of public and private levees, originally constructed for the reclamation of
overflowed lands, on the west bank from the highlands of
Arkansas to the mouth of the Red river, and from the
mouth of the Red river to the Passes, and on the east
bank from the highlands of Tennessee to the mouth of the
Yazoo river, and from Baton Rouge to the Passes; but
from the mouth of the Yazoo river to Baton Rouge,
instead of adopting and constructing levees, have made
use of the highlands skirting the river for said purpose,
and have thus placed the plantations of petitioners, and
others similarly situated between the lines of embankment, and exposed to the full force of the currents of the
river, with such increased and abnormal flood level.
"And are so raising, enlarging, strbngthening, adding
to and constructing such levees, as to cause the plantations
of petitioners, and others so situated to be flooded annually by the waters of the river, and to destroy the crops,
growing and grown thereon, and to drown the live stock,
and to undermine and wash away the buildings, fences and
other improvements, and to fill up the drains and ditches,
and to wash off the soil, and to cover the lands with sand
and gravel, and to render them unfit for cultivation, and
to entirely destroy their value.
"4. That in pursuance of the said plan for the improvement of the navigation of the river, the said officers and
agents of the United States have undertaken' to close the
Atchafalaya river, a natural outlet carrying off near onethird of the surplus waters of the Mississippi, and to
force the waters of the Red river and its tributaries, from
their natural course through the Atchafalaya river to the
Gulf of Mexico, into the channel of the Mississippi river,

and have so obstructed, and are so obstructing, the passage of the surplus waters through the Atchafalaya as
to cause the waters of the rivers at the flood stage to
annually back up and overflow the lands of petitioners,
and to destroy the crops, growing and grown thereon, and
to deposit thereon superinduced additions of water, earth,
sand and gravel, so as to render them unfit for cultivation,
and to entirely destroy their value.
"5 That by reason of the premises aforesaid the lands
of petitioners, which before, from their natural situation,
were comparatively high and secure from overflow, have
been flooded annually by the waters of the rivers thus
confined, in the years 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1893, and the
crops growing and grown thereon, have been each year
destroyed by said overflows, so caused, and the live stock
drowned, and buildings and fences and other improvements undermined and 'washed away, and the ditches
and drains filled up and the soil washed off, and covered
with sand, and earth and gravel, so as to render them unfit
for cultivation, and to entirely destroy their value, to
the injury and damage of' petitioners, as follows, towit:
Following an enumeration of loss of crops and personal
property in the years 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1893 and the
fixing of the value of the land at $50,000, recovery was
prayed of $107,257.50, asserted to-be due because under
the facts alleged there had been a taking of the property
by the United States for public use.
A demurrer to this petition was overruled on June 1,
1896. The nature of theruling is indicated by the following excerpt from the opinion, reported in 31 Ct. Cls. 318:
"The petition undoubtedly sets up losses which are in
the nature of consequentil damages, of which the court
has not jurisdiction. The Government may have increased the effect of the flood wrongfully or rightfully by
the erection of its levees; but it did not in the constitutional

sense of the term take the claimant's cotton, mules, corn,
cattle, and sheep for public use. Such a claim is not
founded on an implied contract, and of it the court has
not jurisdiction. But the petition does allege that 'the
value of the land and the improvements destroyed was
$50,000;' and that taking is presented by allegations
so closely resembling those in the Pumpelly v. Green Bay
Company. Case that this court does not feel at liberty to
say that they present no valid cause of action."
It is stated in the record that during the year 1908,
first, second and third supplemental petitions were filed,
although they are not reproduced, but the court below
in its opinion declares the aggregate damages claimed was
$569,702.50. To these petitions a demurrer-seems to have
been filed by the United States, which was passed upon
in 1910, the order on the subject reading as follows:
,Within the former ruling in this case (31 Ct. Cls., 318),
the demurrer to the original and supplemental petitions,
in so far as they or either of them aver a taking of real
estate-within six years from the date of filing of said
petitions-by overflow proximately caused by the construction of levees or other public works in the improvement of the navigation of the Mississippi River pursuant
to acts of Congress and within the ruling of the cases of
Pumpelly v. Green Bay Company (13 Wall., 166) and
United States v. Lynah (188 U. S., 445), is overruled.
But as to the alleged annual destruction of crops and
personal property on said land so taken by overflow the
demurrer is sustained."
Besides the supplemental petitions just referred to and
the action of the court thereon in the period of sixteen
years which elapsed between the entry of the order
overruling the first demurrer in 1896 and January 5,
1912, when what is styled a fourth supplemental petition
was filed, many proceedings were had, such as a hearing,

230 U. S.

filing of motions to set aside the same, to amend the findings, etc, etc., none of which we need particularly refer
to because in the first place, although mentioned, they
are not reproduced in the record and in the second place,
because we take it that the filing of the fourth supplemental
petition was by permission of the court and with the consent of the United States, permitted for the purpose of
restating the case of the claimants in its best possible
aspect so that in the light of what had'transpired a final
disposition of the controversy might be had. We so conclude because there is not the slightest indication in the
record of any objection having been made to the filing
of the fourth amended petition and because obviously
it had the significance which we attribute to it since the
findings of fact which the court made the basis of the
decree which is here under review in most important
particulars, but copies and reproduces the allegations in,
the fourth supplemental petition. It becomes important
therefore to exactly understand the issues presented by
this petition before coming to consider and dispose of the
case. And to this end, omitting all reference to averments relating to the mere description of the property
involved or its value, we shall endeavor, not following
the order of statement in the pleading, to accurately
summarize its contents.
First. As to the situation of the lands, it- was averred
that said "lands are situated at Jackson Point, in the
Alluvial Valley of the Mississippi, on the left bank of
the river, 40 miles below Natchez and 25 miles above
the mouth of Red River. That the basin in which the
Jackson lands are situated commences at Ellis Cliffs, about
20 miles below Natchez, and extends to Fort Adams,
about fifty miles below, with an average width of 2 miles
and a maximum width of 6 miles,- and is one of six (6)
small basins of the Homochitto Basin," a description which
beyond doubt-, fixes the location of the lands as within

JACKSON v. UNITED STATES.
230 U, S.

Opinion of the Court.

the minor basin lying between Ellis Cliffs and Fort Adams,
the area and description of which as given in the recent
report of the Mississippi River Commission we have
before reproduced.
Second. As to the condition of the property prior to
the doing of the acts complained of, it suffices to say
that it was alleged that by means of levee protection
resulting from work done by the owners of the property
along the river bank, the property had been protected,
that crops of large value had been raised thereon, and that
improvernents had been put thereon and that as a result
of this protection by the levees built by the owners, although the property was occasionally overflowed by breaks
in the levee, the overflow when it came was not destructive
or of such long duration as to prevent the making of a
crop, and that the property was highly improved, stocked
with implements, etc., as alleged in the original petition,
and was bf great productive capacity and of large value
to the owners.
Third. The facts from which it was alleged the property
had been so injured. or destroyed by work done by officers
of the United States as to constitute a taking of the property by the United States for which adequate compensation was due, are stated under the following headings:
a. That about the year 1883 the officers and agents of
the United States, "in pursuance of the Act of Congress
creating the Mississippi River Commission, and of :the
subsequent acts for the improvement of the navigation
of the Mississippi River, adopted the so-called Eads plan,
by Act of Congress approved March 3, 1881, in consequence whereof have projected, and have constructed,
and are constructing a continuous system of public
works, for the purpose of so confining the flood- waters
of the river between lines of embankment, or levees, as
to -give increased elevation and velocity and force, to
the currents, in order to scour and deepen the channel,

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

2.% U. S.

and have thus caused an increased and abnormal elevation
of at least nine feet to the waters of the river at the high
water or flood stage; and for said purpose have adopted
and made use of systems of public and private levees,
originally constructed for the reclamation of overflowed
lands, on the west bank from the highlands of Arkansas
to the mouth of the Red River, and from the mouth of
the Red River to the Passes. . .
b. That for time beyond the memory of man the flood
waters of the Mississippi River, passing Helena, Arkansas,
where the highlands abut on the river, had escaped into
the White River and Upper Tensas Basins, and passed
in part through various designated bayous, rivers or
streams which as we have previously said in describing
the White, River and Tensas basins on the west bank
carried to the Gulf independently of the Mississippi
waters which enter into or overflow these great watersheds. It being moreover, however, alleged that if theythat is, the waters passing Helena and which did n~t
escape into the White River and Tensas Basins--" ever
reached the lands of claimants in sufficient volume to
flow them were speedily reduced by crevasses on the west
bank, which allowed them to escape into the Atchafalaya
Basin, and thus relieved the lands of claimants."
That in executing, their plans as above described the
officers of the United States had by the levees which they
had constructed or maintained along the front of the
White River and Tensas Basins, prevented the flow of a
large volume of water into those basins which would
,have found its way to the Gulf without returning to the
Alississippi as above stated, and had thus increased largely
the volume of-water flowing past the claimants' land
and which therefore in time of flood would rest against
the levee, which protected their lands from overflow.
c: Thg0 for the purpose of carrying out their plans,
the officers had built a levee to close a very extensive

230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

break or crevasse in the levees on the west bank opposite
to, or nearly so to the lands of the claimants on the east
bank, known as the Bougere Crevasse, which carried off
a great volume of water and relieved the pressure on the
claimants' levee and thus additionally by retaining such
water in the river augmenting the risk of overflow by
increasing the danger of a break in the levees of claimants.
d. Because yet further to give effect to their plans, the
officers of the United States had prevented large quantities
of water which otherwise would have reached the Gulf
through the Atchafalaya river, from taking that course,
by works designed to retain water in the Mississippi,
thus causing the water to back up against claimants'
levee, and greatly increasing the danger of overflow.
e.That the plantations of petitioners are located within
the limits of a narrow strip of land lying between the low
water bank of the Mississippi River and the highlands
east of it between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge, where
the highlands skirt very closely to the river bank and are
not protected by levee construction other than that built
by the claimants, which has been destroyed and washed
away by the recent flood waters of said river after the levee
system had practically reached a state of completion
and the United States had closed the Bougere Crevasse,
as hereinafter alleged.
"That the United States has not attempted to connect
the levee line on the east side of said river by the construction of levees on said irregular and narrow strip of land
lying between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge for the reason
that the cost of said levee construction, as shown by the
Mississippi River Commission's Report for 1896, and the
report and survey of the small basins in the Homochitto
levee district between Ellis Cliff and Fort Adams, made
in 1895 by Col. Geo. B. McC. Derby, the engineer officer
in charge of said district, would exceed the value of the
land lying between the river and the foothills, (of which

OCTOBER TERM, 1912.
Opinion of the Court.

230 U. S.

petitioners' lands are a part), to the amount of $206,500.00,
it being more economical to use the foothills as levees,
as now being done, and pay for the land destroyed, than
to build levees on the east bank of said river between said
city of Vicksburg and the city of Baton Rouge. That the
Mississippi River Commission, in its report for the year
1910, in part says that the lands of petitioners are now
subject to perpetual inundation."
The court below made elaborate findings of fact, con'tained in twenty-five numbered paragraphs. The first
four relate to the title of the claimants to the land and we
need not review them. Findings 5; 6,7, 8, and 9 relate
to the condition of the river prior to the work done by
the Government, to the escaping of water into the White
River and Tensas Basins as alleged, and to the increased
pressure brought upon the levees protecting the lands of
the claimants, to the greater frequency of overflow of
such lands, etc., etc., some of these findings aswe have
said, being in the very words of the allegations of the
supplemental and amended petition of 1912. Concerning
the work done by the officers of the United States, findings
numbered 10, 11 and 15 contain the following:
"Prior to the yeur 1883 the States and local authorities
had constructed unconnected lines of levees for the protection and reclamation of lands subject to overflow from
the mouthfkof Red River to the mouth of Arkansas and
from the mouth of the Yazoo to the highlands below
Memphis. The flood waters of 1882 destroyed miles
of these levees.
"Beginning about the year 1883 and continuing to the
present time, the officers and agents of the United States,
pursuant to an act of Congress creating the Mississippi
River Commission and the other acts amendatory thereof,
and for the improvement of the Mississippi River for
navigation, adopted a plan, the so-called Eads plan,

JACKSON v. UNITED STATES.
230 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

and in consequence thereof have projected and constructed
and maintain-and are now engaged in constructing and
maintaining certain lines of levees on both sides of the
river at various places for various distances from Cairo,
Ill., to near the Head of the Passes, a distance of 1,050
miles by river from Cairo, and the local authorities or
organizations of the States bordering along the river
on both sides from Cairo to the Gulf have before and
since 1883 constructed and are now constructing and
maintaining certain lines of levees at various places and of
various lengths for the purpose of protecting and reclaimiipg lands within their respective districts from overflow
in times of high water.
"The levee lines so constructed by the United States
and local authorities have been joined, thus giving a continuous line of levees, as contemplated by the Eads plan,
with the result that the flood waters of the Mississippi
River to a great extent are confined within and between
said levee lines and encompassed within a narrower scope
than heretofore, acquired an increased velocity and higher
elevation and the current thereof has become stronger
and more forceful.
"The plan of the officers and agents of the United States
so acting was to increase said velocity and scouring power
of the water and to scour and deepen the channel of the
Mississippi River and thereby improve it for navigation,
and the purpose of the officers and agents of the State and
local authorities constructing lines (if levees at, various
points along and on both sides of the river was to reclaim
and to protect land from overflow in times of high water.
By so doing, the waters being thus confined within a narrower compass, as above indicated, have attained a higher
elevation of approximately 6 feet in times of high water.

leveed on both sides, except on the east side, where the
highlands abut on or near the river in Kentucky and
Tennessee (from Port Jefferson, Ky., to a short distance
south of Memphis, Tenn.) and thence on the west side
to near the Head of the Passes,.or to a point 1,050 miles
by the river from Cairo, and on the east side from Baton
Rouge to the same point near the Head of the Passes,
leaving a gap in the line of levees of 234 miles in length,
from the mouth of the Yazoo River to Baton Rouge, unleveed, where the foothills in some places hug closely to
the east bank of the river, and at other points are from
2 to 6 miles from the river, in which strip of territory the
lands of claimants are located between the highlands and
the river, as before stated.
"The extension of the general levee system by the
United States and the local authorities, since the United
States adopted to its use and assmned 'permanent control'
of the levees theretofore. constructed by State and local
authorities, has resulted in an increased elevation of the
general flood levels, which subjects the claimants' lands
to deeper overflow than they were subject to formerly, or
would be subject to now, if the levee system were not in
existence, and consequently has destroyed its value for
agricultural and grazing purposes, causing its abandonment for that purpose since the year 1908. The immediate
cause of the deeper overflow of claimants' land is the increased elevation of flood heights which is the result of
the general confinement of the flood discharge by the
levee system as a whole.
"Xv.
"Before the creation of the Mississippi River Commission by act of Congress, and the adoption of the Eads
plan as aforesaid, the levee lines along the Mississippi
River theretofore constructed by State and local authorities consisted of a broken chain of levees of insuffieicnt
height and strength to confine the flood waters, and had

JACKSON v. UNITED STATES.
230 U. S.

Opinion ( kae Co irt.

been built without regard to a uniform grade line. The
United States then caused a survey and report to be made
,byits officers and agents showing the condition and location of levee lines theretofore constructed by State and
local authorities as they then existed. This survey suggested a proposed continuous system of levees from Cairo
to the Head of the Passes. In many instances it was a
blanket survey which encompassed and took in the lines
of levees theTetofore constructed by State and local authorities as above stated. The project recommended by
the Mississippi River Commission adopting the Eads plan
for the systematic improvement of the river from Cairo to
the Head of the Passes was practically adopted by act
of Congress approved March 3; 1881. The United States
then undertook the projection and completion of a continuous line of levees from Cairo to the Head of the Passes,
as suggested by this survey and th6 Eads plan, and as
recommended by the Mississippi River Commission, and,
in furtherance of that plan and as part of and supplementary thereto, adopted to its use, and is now using, the
levees theretofore constructed by'State and local authoritics, thereafter making them much larger and stronger.
Since that'time, levee construction, whether done by the
United States or State and local authorities, has been in
conformity with the grades and methods of construction
adopted by the Mississippi River Commission, and the efficiency of the levee system has been largely due to this fact.
"The extension of this levee system by the United

part of the Untied States, basing its views on this subject
upon Bedford V. United States, 192 U. S. 217, 225. The
petition was therefore dismissed.
Before we take up the contentions advanced by the
appellants to establish that the court below was wrong
in deciding that there was no liability on the part of the
United States, we consider it necessary, lest misconception
otherwise might result, to refer to what we deem to be
grave errors committed by-the court in certain particulars,
even although in passing upon the merits we shall consider
the case in such an aspect as to cause it to be unnecessary
to review the errors in question for the purpose of passing
on the merits. In the first place it is apparent that in
many important respects 'matters which the court below
has stated as findings of fact are mere conclusions of law.
This is true for instance of the broad conclusion embodied
in the findings -of fact as to the relation of the United
States to levee work and the power of the Mississippi
River Commission over all such work by whomsoever
performed. In the second place, treating it as a question
of law, we think the error is apparent from a consideration
of the statutes and the official reports relating to the subject, which we may judicially notice. It is true indeed
that when the Eads theory, illustrated by the successful
jettying of the mouth of the river under a contract made
with Captain Eads, came to be understood and it also
came to be appreciated that the most efficient way to improve the navigation of the river was to ultilize the vast
power of the river, by confining its waters within its banks,
thus directing its energies to cutting out a deeper channel,
Congress legislated to the accomplishment of such result
by the creation of the Mississippi River Commission, and
by conferring the power upon that body to improve the
navigation of the river and to build levees for that purpose
with the appropriations which were made from time to
time to carry out these great purposes. But nothing in

that legislation justifies the conclusioin that, irrespective
of navigation, Congress assumed control of the entire
work of protection from overflow by levees, to the displacement of the state or local authorities, On the contrary, the reports of the Commission and the public documents and history connected with the same leave no room
to doubt that as necessarily the levees built by the United
States in aid of navigation at the same time afforded protection from overflow and thus served a twofold purpose
that thereby renewed energy was stimulated in state and
local authorities to undertake the work of building levees
for protection, so that otie continuous and complete system of protection would be evolved. It is of course true,
also, that the intelligent work of the Mississippi River
Commission furnished a standard which served in a sense
to control and direct the ,co6perating energies of others.
The gravity of the error, as expressed in the findings of
the court below, is illustrated by the fact that it treated
the injury alleged to have been suffered as arising alone
from the acts of the United States, when in, truth, if there
was such injury, it could only have resulted from the concurrent action of the United States, the States and their
subOrdinate agencies, including individuals, all acting to
the realization of a common end, that is, an efficient tnid
continuous line of levees, although action was impelled
by different considerations. This is illustrated by the
statement made by the MIississippi River Commission in
its annual report for 1894, pp.-2713-2715, where, in referring either to the claim of damage made in this case or to
one like it, it was said:
"The injury will not be traceable to levees built by the
United States any more than to those built by the States

and local organizations. Neither can it be attributed to
the levees on any particular or linited portions of the
river. Itwill be a result of the system as a whole."
But passing, for the sake of argument, these considera-

tions, let us look at the case in the light of the findings as
nade.
It is apparent, taking the broadest possible view in favor
of the claimants, that the grievance which they allege
they have suffered, can only rest upon three grounds:
.1st. The building by the officers of the United States of
lines of levees along the bank of the river for the purpose
of retaining the water in the river, treating, for the sake
of the argument, all acts done by the local authorities in
building levees or closing breaks as acts of the United
States.
2nd. The failure of the United States to build on the
east bank of the river along the minor basins which we
have fully described, a line of levees so as to afford means
of protection from the increased danger of overflow arising
from the fact that the lines of levees along the river on
the west bank and elsewhere had been raised and strengthened andextended, thus at least beyond doubt temporarily increasing the level of the flood in times of high
water.
3rd. The performance of work by the United States
tending to diminish the outflow of water from the river
through streams which flowed from it, to the end that a
more efficient body of water might remain in the stream
for the purpose of accomplishing the deepening of the
channel and thus more effectively improving the navigable capacity of the river.
Let us primarily test th merits of the first ground of
complaint, that is, the building of levees. It is not averred
that the land of the claimants bordering on the east bank
of the river in the absence of all levees and in a state of
nature would not in seasons of high water, be overflowed;
and if it had been so alleged it is certain there.would be no
right on the part of an individual to insist that primitive
conditions be suffered to rmain and thus all progress and
development be rendered impossible, When accurately

fixed, the complaint is but this, that because the claimants
had built a levee for the purpose of protecting their lands
and which answered that purpose if levees were not built
by others to protect their lands, actionable injury would
be occasioned claimants when anybody else sought to protect his land from overflow, since to so do would increase
the volume of water in the river and raise the flood level
to the detriment of claimants. In its essence, however,
this but amounts to saying that because the claimants
have built a levee along their property for the purpose of
protecting it from overflow in times of high water, they
have acquired the right to stereotype the conditions existing at the time they built their levee even to the extent of
preventing any one from .subsequently exerting his right
to build a levee to protect his land. Nothing could more
completely illustrate the accuracy of this statement than
the averments in the supplemental petition concerning
the closing of the Bougere Crevasse, since those averments
in their last analysis but charge that there was a right on
the part of the claimants to subject a vast area of country
on the west bank to the devastation resulting from the
existence of so extensive a crevasse, simply because to
close it would subject the levee of claimants across the
river, to a greater pressure consequent on the retaining of
the flood water of the river within its banks. And indeed
a like illustration is afforded by the averments as to the
escape of water from the river on the west bank, and the
spread of that w ater through the White River and Tensas
Basins until it ultimately reached the Gulf, by emptying
into remote streams. To make the demonstration, if possible, clearer, let us suppose that by the acts of individuals
for their own protection sanctioned by the local laws, a
complete line of levees had been built accomplishing the
very result which it is insisted brought about the injury
here complained of. Would it be said that the claimants
would have a resulting right of action in damages because

other owners bad exerted the very right which the claimants had previously resorted to for the purpose of protecting their own land? If not, upon what imaginary
ground can it be said that because a work which was lawful
in and of itself, was done by the United States, therefore
responsibility in favor of the claimants was entailed ,
Coming to the second contention, we think it is disposed
of by the following considerations:
In the first place-by the report of the Commission to
which we have referred the impossibility was pointed out
of building a levee along the line of the minor basin in
which the land of claimants is situ: ted, without dhstroying
said land, because of its peculiar situatio , unless there was
a permanent system of pumping to take out the water
which would gather in the watershed. In the second place
-looked at from the point of individual right and corresponding responsibility, it is impossible to conceive by
what principle it can be said that because an individual
having a right to do so has built a levee to protect his land
from overflow, and because his levee has accomplished that
result by retaining the water in the river, that thereby
there arose a duty on his part to build a levee to protect
the land of another or in the alternative to pay for such
land.
Indeed, the propositions but assert on the one hand that
the United States is liable because it did that which it had
a right to do.and on the other that it is liable because it,
abstained from doing that which it was under no duty to
do. Both the fundamental errors which the contentions
inv(ve are exemplified in the arguments ued to sustain
them since, it is urged that because the levees construced
on the bank of the river operated to keep the water in the
river from flowing out, that thereby they served to bring
water into the river from without, and that the mere abstention from building levees at a particular place or on
a particular line operated to transfer the bank of the river

Opinion of the Court.

over to the foot of the hills or to move the hills over to the
river so as to cause them to become its banks.
The third consideration, that is, the preventing of the
outflow of water by work done in the tributaries and the
consequent increase in the volume of water in the river,
cannot be tested from the point of view of individual authority, as the power to so do involves necessarily the
exercise of governmental power. We therefore come to
consider the proposition in that aspect. In doing so, however, it is to be observed that even if all the previous considerations which we have stated concerning the nonliability to result from building levees, measured by the
right of an individual to build a levee to prevent the water
of a river from overflowing its banks and destroying his
property, be put out of view, and the case therefore in all
its aspects be tested by the scope of the governmental
authority possessed by the United States, the absence of
merit in all the claims is too clear to require anything but
statement. We say this because the plenary power of the
United States to legislate for the benefit of navigation and
to construct such works as are appropriate to that end,
without liability, for remote or consequential damages,
has been so often decided as to cause the subject not to be
open. It was directly ruled as to work done by the Mississippi River Commission in Bedford v. United States, 192
U. S. 217, 225, upon the authority of which case, as we
have said, the court below placed its ruling, and as the
underlying principles which controlled the decision in the
Bedford Case and which govern the subject were again at
this term with much elaboration stated and applied, we
think it unnecessary to do more than refer to that ruling
(United States v. Chandler-DunbarWater Power Co., 229
U. S. 53), and to direct that the judgment below be
Affirmed.
