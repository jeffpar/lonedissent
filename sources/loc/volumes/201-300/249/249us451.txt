v. ATCHISON, TOPEKA &

SANTA FE RAILWAY COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 201.

Argued March 11, 12, 1919.-Decided April 14, 1919.

The Act of March 4, 1913, e. 143, 37 Stat. 791, 797, authorizing the
Postmaster General to add, not exceeding 5 per cent. per annum,
to the compensation of railroads, under certain pending contracts
for transportation of mail, left the increases, within that limit, to
his discretion; the plain import of the words used must control.
P. 454.
52 Ct. Clms. 338, reversed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Brown, with whom Mr.
Leonard Zeisler was on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. Alex. Britton, with whom Mr. Evans Browne and
Mr. Francis W. Clements were on the brief, for appellee,
invoked the legislative history of the act to prove that
an extra allowance of full 5 per cent. was intended, without giving any discretion to the Postmaster General to
fix a smaller amount. This was so plain, especially if the
act be taken as a whole and with others in pari materia,
that it ought even to prevail against the letter of the
enactment. (1) Blake v. National Banks, 23 Wall. 307;

In making this substituted provision, Congress used
language legally identical with that employed in the
basic statute fixing railway-mail rates, which language
for more than forty years has been construed as requiring
the payment by the Postmaster General of the rates
named in the statute which he was "not to exceed"from all of which the conclusion is irresistible that Congress intended that the Act of March 4, 1913, should
operate the same as had the Act of March 3, 1873. Wisconsin Central R. R. Co. v. United States, 164 U. S. 190,
205.
If any discretion was vested in the Postmaster General,
it was to fix a flat increase not exceeding 5 per cent. for
all routes. There appears no support for the theory that
he was to increase the pay of one route 2 per cent.,
another 4 per cent., and so on. In allowing 5 per cent.
increase to certain routes, the Postmaster General exercised whatever discretion was reserved to him, and
he was bound by the law to make an equal allowance
to all routes.
The method pursued by the Postmaster General of
fixing the.percentage of increase was not a valid exercise
of discretion.
Memorandum opinion by MR.JUSTICE McRYNOLDS.
During 1910 aaid 1911 the appellee railway company
entered into customary arrangements with the Post Office
Department to carry mail over a number of routes for
quadrennial terms ending June 30, 1914, and 1915, com-

Opinion of the Court.

pensation to be based upon ascertained weights. While
these were in force, by Act of August 24, 1912, c. 389,
37 Stat. 557, Congress directed establishment of the
parcel post service without providing for any additional
compensation on account of the large increase in weights
which would surely follow.
The Postmaster General called attention to the matter
January 20, 1913; and after much consideration the
following clause was incorporated in the Act of March 4,
1913, c. 143, 37 Stat. 791, 797:
"That on account of the increased weight of mails
resulting from the enactment of section eight of the Act
Df August twenty-fourth, nineteen hundred and twelve,
the Postmaster General is authorized to add to
the compensation paid for transportation on railroad
routes on and after July first, nineteen hundred and
thirteen, for the remainde" of the contract tc,'rms, not
exceeding five per centum thereof per annum, excepting
upon routes weighed since January first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and to be readjusted from July first,
nineteen hundred and thirteen, until otherwise provided
by law."
Acting under this provision, the Postmaster General
refused to allow increased compensation of five per centum
upon all routes, but apportioned payments among themnever in excess of five per centum-according to a carefully worked out formula which he deemed appropriate.
Appellee sued for the difference between amount actually
received and what it would have received if five per
centum had been added. Considering history of the
legislation and intent of Congress supposed to be indicated
thereby the Court of Claims held that the act "required
the Postmaster General to add 5 per cent. to the compensation being paid on all of said routes, and he having
failed to do so that the plaintiff is entitled to recover
the difference sued for." 52 Ct. Clms. 338, 361.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

We are unable to agree with this conclusion. :The
language of the enactment is clear and we think it vested
in the Postmaster General a discretion which, so far as
shown by the record, has not been abused. We are not
unmindful of the burden imposed upon appellee nor of
the circumstances which lend color to a different conclusion; but these are not sufficient to justify a disregard
of the plain import of the words which Congress deliberately adopted.
The judgment below must be reversed and the cause
remanded with direction to dismiss the petition.
Reversed and remanded.

ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
GEORGIA.
No. 191.

Submitted January 24, 1919.-Decided April 14, 1919.

One who-acquires liquor after approval and before the effective date
of a state law making its possession unlawful is not deprived by the
law of his property without due process. P. 459.

It must be presumed that the liquor was acquired between those dates
when the date of acquisition is not shown. Id.
Whether such a law would be constitutional as applied to one who
acquired liquor before its enactment-not decided. P. 460.
A federal question which was not decided by the State Supreme Court
