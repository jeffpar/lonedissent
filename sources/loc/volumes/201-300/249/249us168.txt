widow and children under the New York Workmen's
Compensation Law.
If the deceased was employed in interstate commerce
when the accident occurred, consequent rights and liabilities arose under the Federal Employers' Liability Act
and the state statute did not apply. New York Central
R. R. Co. v. Winfield, 244 U. S. 147; Erie R. R. Co. v.
Winfield, 244 U. S. 170.
The evidence showed and the State Workmen's Compensation Commission found: "Lewis M. Porter resided
at Camden, N. Y., and upon the date of the accident,
December 17, 1914, was in the employ of The New York
Central Railroad Company as a laborer. On said date,
while engaged in shoveling snow upon the premises of
The New York Central Railroad Company between the
west bound track and a platform near the intersection of
said tracks and Mexico Street in the Village of Camden,
he was struck by the engine of a passenger train known
as train No. 49, which was proceeding northerly on the
west bound track, receiving injuries from which he died
immediately. The tracks of The New York Central
Railroad Company at the point where the deceased was
working, were used for the purpose of transporting both
interstate and intrastate cars and both interstate and intrastate commerce."
Considered in connection with our opinions in Pedersen
v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., 229 U. S.
146; Southern Ry. Co. v. Puckett, 244 U. S. 571, and cases
there cited, we think the circumstances here presented
make it quite clear that when killed Porter was employed
in interstate commerce. Accordingly, the judgment
below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
