GILCREASE v. McCULLOUGH ET AL.
CERTIORARI

TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA.

No. 167.

Argued January 21, 1919.-Decided March 3, 1919.

In declaring the enrollment records of the Commission to the Five
Civilized Tribes conclusive evidence of age, the Act of May 27, 1908,
c. 199, ยง 3, 35 Stat. 312, 313, does not exclude other evidence on the
subject consistent with the records and enrollment. P. 180.
Hence, where the enrollment record purported to show the age of an
Indian, at time of application for enrollment, in years only, evidence
that he was several months older was andmisible. Id.
162 Pac. Rep. 178, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. A. J. Biddison for petitioner.
Mr. James B. Diggs, with whom Mr. Frederick deC.
Faust, Mr. F. C. Proctor,Mr. D. Edward Greer, Mr. Rush
Greenslade and Mr. W. C. Liedtke were on the brief, for
respondents.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the court.

Thomas Gilcrease, a Creek Indian of one-eighth blood,
received, under date of December 15, 1902, an allotment
of surplus land under Act of Congress, March 1, 1901,
c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, as amended by Act of June 30, 1902,
c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500. On February 8, 1911, his twentyfirst birthday, he executed to McCullough and Martin
an oil and gas lease thereof. Later he brought suit in a
state court of Oklahoma to set it aside, insisting that,
under the applicable enrollment record of Creek citizenship, he must be assumed to have been under age at the
time the lease was executed, although he had in fact

ittained his majority. The trial court entered judgment
.or the defendants which was affirmed by the Supreme
Court of the State; and a rehearing was denied, January 9,
1917. 162 Pac. Rep. 178. The case comes here on writ
of certiorari. 243 U. S. 653.
The only substantial question submitted is this: Did
the entry concerning Gilcrease's age made in the enrollment record of Creek citizenship preclude defendant from
showing that he was actually of age when the lease was
executed? The decision of that question depends wholly
upon the construction to be given ยง3 of the Act of May 27,
1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, 313, as applied to the record.
Section 3 provides:
"That the rolls of citizenship and of freedmen of the
Five Civilized Tribes approved by the Secretary of the Interior shall be conclusive evidence as to the quantum of
Indian blood of any enrolled citizen or freedman of said
tribes and of no other persons to determine questions arising under this Act and the enrollment records of the Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes shall hereafter be conclusive evidence as to the age of said citizen or freedman."
The enrollment record introduced in evidence, so far as
material, is as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion Qf the Court.

249 U. S.

Gilcrease insists that the entry "June 9/99," near the
lower right-hand corner of the enrollment card, signifies
that the application for .his enrollment was made on June
9, 1899; that in giving his age as "9," the roll declared him
to be exactly nine years old on June 9, 1899; and that,
consequently, in the absence of other evidence to the
contrary in the enrollment record, he must be deemed to
have been under age on February 8, 1911.
But there was no declaration or finding of fact by the
Commission that Gilcrease was. exactly 9 years old on
June 9, 1899. The declaration that a person is 9 years
of age signifies, in the 'absence of conditions -requiring
exact specification, merely that he has reached or passed
the ninth anniversary of his birth and is still less than
ten years old. There was neither.a statute nor a regulation of the Commission which required an exact specification of age. Nor did the printed blank used for the
enrollment provide a space either for entering the date
of applicant's birthday or for entering the number of
months and days by which his age exceeded a full year.
Furthermore, the enrollment card itself bears positive
evidence that it did not purport to represent the applicant
as being exactly 9 years old on the day of application.
For this same card records, in like mamner, on. the asisumed date of application, also the ages of his mother,
of three brothers, and a sister. Is the court expected to
believe that the Commission found, that the six members
of the family were all born on the ninth day of June?
Gilcrease insists, however, that the act makes the-enrollment record not merely "conclusive," but the exclusive "evidence as to the age' of the citizen; or, in other
words, that Congress has provided, not a rule of evidence,
but the following rule of substantive law: Whenever a
member of the Five Civilized Tribes is stated in the enroll*mentrecord to be a certain number of years old and the
day of his enrollment is stated therein, he shall be unable

Opinion of the Court.

to convey his lands so long as the rolls do not show affirmatively that he is 21 years old. For this contention
there is no support in -the words of the statute; nor is there
any in reason. As well might it be contended that where
the record states the number of the applicant's years,
but gives only the yeiar and not the day or the month of
the application of enrollment, evidence could not be introduced to show that the application was made before
December 31st of the year given; or that, if no age whatever appeared in the enrollment record, the citizen must
for 21 years after the date of enrollment be conclusively
presumed to be a minor. The enrollment record is, of
course, conclusive as to that which it in terms recites or
which is necessarily implied from the words and figures
used. But there is no indication of an intention on the
part of Congress that facts not inconsistent with the recitals of the record shall not be proved, whenever relevant.
The roll had already been held to be practically conclusive
as to facts, the determination of which was a condition
precedent to enrollment. Compare United States v. Wildcat, 244 U. S. 111. The purpose of ยง 3 of the Act of Miy
27, 1908, seems to have been simply to make the record
conclusive as to age in so far as it purports to state age.
The cases in the lower federal courts, the recent decisions
in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, and the great weight
of all the authorities support the proposition that, when
the age is stated simply in years or whenever the age is
not stated definitely by the addition of the months or
days, other evidence imay be introduced to supplement
the'record by proving these and thus establish the exact
date of birth."
