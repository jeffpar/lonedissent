UNITED STATES v. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD
COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 199.

Argued January 30, 1919.-Decided March 31, 1919.

The term "troops of the United States," as used in land grant acts,
and in the agreement of the Union Pacific Company, in relation to
transportation for the Government, held not to embrace any of the
following classes of persons, when trayeling separately and not as
part of a moving body or detachment of soldiers, viz: Discharged
soldiers, discharged military prisoners, and rejected applicants for
enlistment; applicants for enlistment, provisionally accepted, but
subject to final examination and not sworn in; retired enlisted men;
and furloughed soldiers en route back to their stations.
52 Ct. Clms. 226, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Assistant Auorney General Brown, with whom Mr.

Charles H. Weston was on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. William R. Harr, with whom Mr. Charles H.
Bates was on the brief, for appellee.
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
Most of the acts of Congress which granted lands in
aid of railroads provide that they shall be "free from
toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States." I This clause was

construed in Lake Superior & Mississippi R. R. Co. v.
United States, 93 U. S. 442, as conferring only the free use
of the roadbed as a highway. Since then, under appropriate legislation, payment has come to be made by the
Government for the transportation of property and
troops at rates equal to fifty per cent. of those charged
private parties. The Union Pacific, having entered into
an agreement to that effect, claimed payment at the full
rate for certain persons carried as passengers upon the
request of the Government. The Auditor of the War
Department refused to allow payment for these passengers at more than half-fares, on the ground that they
were within the provision, for transporting "troops of
the United States"; and his ruiing was sustained by the
Comptroller of the Treasury. (21 Decisions of the Comptroller, 651.) Thereupon this suit was brought in the
Court of Claims fot the amount disallowed; and judgment was rendered for the railroad. 52 Ct. Chins. 226.
The case is here on appeal. The questions presented are

the grant is "subject to such regulations as Congress may impose
government transportation."

Act of July 27, 1866, c. 278, § 11, 14 Stat. 292, 297. The Army Appropriation Acts make provision for payment-under both classes of statutes, payment in neither case to exceed fifty per cent. of the rates
charged private parties. See Act of July 16, 1892, e. 195, 27 Stat.
174, 180; Act of March 2, 1913, c. 93, 37 Stat. 704, 715. Fifty per
cent. has been adopted by the War Department as the standard rate
of payment. The Union Pacific on May 15, and June 3, 1911, became
a party to the so-called "Land-Grant Equalization Agreements"
entered into hv the Quartermaster General of the United States with
most of the important roads of the Tnited States in other than New
England or Trunk Line territories. By these agreements, the several
roads consented (with certain exceptions) to accept the same net rate
on both passenger and freight traffic via their respective lines as are
effective via land-grant lines. "Freight and Passenger Land-Grant

OCTO3ER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

249 U. S.

whether any of the following classes of persons are to be
deemed "troops of the United States" within the provision of the land-grant acts:
1. Discharged soldiers; that is, former enlisted men
of the Army en route to their homes after discharge.
2. Discharged military prisoners; that is, discharged
enlisted men en route to their homes or elsewhere after
serving sentence as military prisoners.
3. Rejected applicants for enlistment in the Army;
that is, men who having passed the required tests at the
recruiting stations and having been forwarded to the
recruiting depots for final examination and enlistment,
were there rejected and were being returned to the recruiting stations from which they came.
4. Accepted applicants for enlistment in the Army;
that is, applicants examined at general recruiting stations, found mentally, morally, and physically fit for
service, and being forwarded to recruiting depots for
final examination and enlistment.
5. Retired soldiers; that is, enlisted men ef the Army
en route to their homes after retirement.
6. Furloughcd soldiers; that is, enlisted men of the
Anny on furlough en route back to their proper stations.
None of these persohis travelled as part of a moving
army, troop, or body of soldiers. That is, they travelled
separately as individuals, and (with few exceptions)
each on a different day and to widely scattered destinations. Under recent acts of Congress and Army Regulations,' the transportation of persons of some of these
classes is paid for by the Government.
In defining the transportation rights secured to the
United States, these land-grant acts draw a broad distinction between freight and passengers. All "property"

Opinion of the Court.

of the Government, whatever its character and intended
use, is to be carried "free of toll or other charge;" but
of the many persons in its service, only "troops." The
history of the legislation shows that both the broad term,
"any property," and the narrower one, "troops," was
adopted deliberately. The earliest land-grant act in
which the provision appears is that of September 20,
1850, c. 61, § 4, 9 Stat. 466, 467, under which the Illinois
Central was constructed. The bill as introduced I provided for the free transportation of "troops and muni.tions of war." It was amended so as to read "any property or troops." There had been an earlier act granting
land to the State of Illinois for the construction of a
canal (Act of March 30, 1822, c. 1.4, 3 Stat. 659) which
was amended (Act of March 2, 1833, c. 87, 4 SLat. 662)
bo as to permit, on the same terms, the use and disposition
of the land for railroads. That act provided for the free
transportation of "any property of the United States,
or persons in their service."
In 1850 the word "troops" had (and it has ever since
had) an established meaning :-namely, "soldiers collectively,-a body of soldiers." Thus the Army Appropriation Act of that year (Act of September 28, 1850,
c. 78, § 1, 9 Stat. 504, 506) provides for the "transportation of the army, including the baggage of the troops
when moving either by land or water" and for "mileage,
or the allowance made to officers for the transportation
of themselves and baggage when travelling on duty
without troops." The contemporary legislation draws
a clear distinction also between troops, that is, those then
having the status of soldiers, and those who once had
been in, or were seeking to enter, the military service.
Thus the Army Appropriation Act of TMarch 2, 1847, c.
35, 9 Stat. 149, 151 (which provides in substantially the
'Cong. Globe, 1850, 31st Cong., 1st sess., vol. 19, pt. 1, p. 844.

same terms as that of 1850 for the transportation of
troops) makes specific provision for "forwarding destitute
soldiers to their homes," for the "comfort of discharged
soldiers," and for "expenses of recruiting," which include the cost of transportation. See Army Regulations,
1857, § 1321. And the Resolution of March 3, 1847,
[No. 7], 9 Stat. 206, authorizes the refund of moneys
expended by the States and individuals "in organizing,
subsisting, and transporting volunteers previous to their
being mustered and received into the service of the United
States for the present war, and for subsisting troops in
the service of the United States." In view of the established meaning of the term "troops" as used by Congress
the duty of the court is merely to apply the provisions
of the act to the several classes of persons described
above.
First. The first three classes, namely, discharged
military prisoners, discharged enlisted men, and rejected
applicants for enlistment, are clearly not "troops of the
United States." Their status is that of the civilian. They
form no part of the military establishment. They may
go where they please and do what they please, subject
to no more interference by the military authorities of the
Government, than if they had never been, or had never.
sought to be, connected with the Army. They' were
travelling for their own personal ends. Congress recognizes the distinction between those forming part of the
Army and those who do not, because they are recruits or
have been discharged; and it makes special provision
for their transportation.' Such had formerly been also
the opinion of the Comptroller of the Treasury. Compare Digest, Second Comptroller's Decisions, vol. 4,
§§ 354 and 355.
'E. g., Act of March 2$ 1913, c. 93, 37 Stat. 704, 715; Act of April 27,
1014, c. 72, 38 Stat. 351, 364; Act of March 4, 1915, c. 143, 38 Stat.

Opinion of the Court.

Second. Applicants for enlistment who have been
accepted provisionally, but have yet to be subjected to
the final examination at the recruiting depots and to
take the oath before they become a part of the soldiery
of the Nation, are not "troops of the United States."
It is the actual enlistment, the oath of allegiance, that
changes the status from a civilian to soldier. Compare
In re Grimley, 137 U. S. 147, 156-157; Tyler v. Pomeroy,
8 Allen, 480; 19 Decisions of the Comptroller, 367; Army
Regulations, 1913, § 847. The officers at the recruiting
stations are expressly forbidden to administer this oath.
Army Regulations, 1913, § 841. Such applicant is then
not even a potential soldier; for he may be rejected on
final examination.' And it is the actual and not the
potential status that must govern. Compare Alabama
Great Southern R. R. Co. v. United States, 49 Ct. Cims.
522, 537. The fact that under the Army Regulations he
receives the same rations as an enlisted man, and that he
is subject to the same medical attention,2 does not effect
a change of status. And the fact that the transportation
is for the purposes of the Government in connection with
its military establishment is immaterial. Workmen in
armor plants and civilian clerks in the War Department
at Washington travel for purposes of the Government,
but are obviously not "troops of the United States"
within the meaning of the land-grant legislation. The
Army Appropriation Acts make specific provision for
the transportation of "troops" and of "recruits." I
I Of the 45,111 applicants in the several recruiting districts of the
United States provisionally accepted in the year ending June 30, 1915,
5,866 were finally rejected at the recruiting depots; 3,993 provisionally
accepted applicants are recorded as having "declined to enlist at depots or eloped en route." Report of the Adjutant General, War Department, Annual Reports, 1915, vol. 1, pp. 202, 203.

Third. Retired enlisted men en route to their homes
after retirement are also not "troops of the United
States." They travel for their own purposes. Congress
has declared that such retired men shall for certain purposes be deemed a part of the Army (Act of February 2,
1901, c. 192, § 1, 31 Stat. 748); but they may be employed
only after Congress has authorized the raising of volunteer forces; and not even then for field duty. Act of
April 25, 1914, c. 71, § 11, 38 Stat. 347, 350. The Army
Regulations for 1913 make no provision requiring any
service from retired enlisted men. Practically they have
retired from, and not simply into a different branch of
the Army. Compare Murphy v. United States, 38 Ct.
Clms. 511, 522; Army Regulations, 1913, Article. XX.
See also United States v. Tyler, 105 U. S. 244. The fact
that they may thereafter be called into the Army does
not make them "troops of the United States." Any male
citizen may at some time be called into the service. Compare Alabama Great Southern R. R. Co. v. United States,
supra.
Fourth. The furloughed soldier is, of course, a part of
the Army or troops of the United States; but his transportation back to the proper station, is not "transportation of troops" within the meaning of the land-grant acts.
The furloughed soldier travels for' his own purposes.
The Government merely advances to him the cost of
transportation and subsistence while on furlough; and
does this, only if the soldier lacks funds to bear the expense himself. The advance must be repaid. Army
Regulations, 1913, § 110.
We have no occasion'to consider whether persons not
enlisted as soldiers, but forming a part of a moving army
or detachment are to be deemed "troops of the United
States" within the provision of the land-grant acts; nor
whether a soldier travelling for the purposes of the Government, but not for any purpose connected with war

NARD, v. UNITED STATES.
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 214. Argued March 11, 1919.-Decided March 31, 1919.
In a contract for the construction of two government laboratory
buildings, it was provided that, in case the completion of the work
should be delayed beyondi a period allowed, the United States, in
view of the difficulty of estimating the resulting damages with
exactness, and for the cost of extra inspection and rents, salaries
and other expenses that would be entailed, might deduct $200 for
each day of delay, until the work should be completed, not as a
penalty, but as liquidated damages, computed, estimated and
agreed upon. There was such delay, as to both buildings, that the
amount, thus computed, exceeded $20,000. Held, that the fact that
the amount specified was to be the same whether both buildings
were delayed or only one was not a sufficient reason for considering
it a penalty, nor was there other ground for not giving effect to the
agreement as a genuine pre-estimate of loss. P. 364. Sun Printing
& Publishing Association v. Moore, 183 U. S. 642.
Whether a party should be relieved from a plain stipulation for liquidated damages upon the ground that a penalty was really intended,
will depend upon the facts of the case and not upon a conjectural
situation that might have arisen under the contract. Id.
