adopted the contrary view and upon it rested the conclusion that the Public Commissions were interfering with
establishment of compensatory rates by the receivers in
violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The challenged orders related directly to prices for gas
at burner-tips and only indirectly to the receivers' business. They were under no compulsion to accept unremunerative prices; even the original supply contracts
had not been adopted and were subject to rejection. See
N,wark Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. Newark, 242 U. S.
405. Our conclusion concerning relationship between the
receivers and local companies renders it unnecessary
to discuss the effect of rates prescribed for the latter. The
receivers were in no position to complain of them.
The decrees below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this
opinion.
Reversed and remanded.

bankrupt was insolvent throughout the four months and that, during that period, he gave illegal preferences to such creditor, among,
others. Id.

the right, he remains a stralger to the proceedings. P. 249.

MR. JUSTICE BRAMDnEIs delivered the opinion of the
court.

The trustee in bankxuptcy of the St. Louis Chemical
Company brought suit in a state court of Michigan against
the Gratiot County State Bank to recover, as illegal preferences, payments made to it within four months before
the filing of the involumtary petition. The Bank denied
the allegation that the Chemical Company was insolvent
when the payments were made. To establish that fact,
the Trustee offered in evidence the adjudication together
with the petition on which it was based and the special
umster's report. which it confirmed. The latter found

that the debtor had been insolvent for four months cr
more before the filing of the petition and had made, *hile
so insolvent, certain preferences. The Bank vas not
actually a party to the bankruptcy prt.ceedings And- had
taken no part therein. The trial court held that this evidence was not only admissible but established conclusively that the debtor was insolvent throughout the four
months; and it entered judgment for the Trustee which
was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Michigan (193
Michigan, 452). The case comes here on writ of certiorari
(243 U. S. 645). The only question presented is whether
the state courts erred in holding that the record of the
adjudication made the fact of insolvency at the time of
the payments resjudicataas against the Bank.
First. The Trustee contends that adjudication in
bankruptcy, being in the nature of a judgment in rem,
establishes not only the status of the debtor as a bankrupt,
but also the essential findings of fact on which that judg*ment was based. The adjudication is, for the purpose
of administering the debtor's property, that is, in its
legislative effect, conclusive upon all the world. Compare
Shawhan v. Wherritt, 7 How. 627, 643. So far as it declares the status of the debtor, even strangers to the decree may not attack it collaterally. Michaels v. Post,
21 Wall. 398, 428; New. Lamp Chimney Co. V. Ansonia
Brass & Copper Co., 91 U. S. 656, 661-662.' Compare
Hebert v. Crawford, 228 U. S. 204, 208-209. But an adjudication in bankruptcy, like other judgments in rem,
is not res judicata as to the facts or as to the subsidiary
questions of 'law on which it is based, except as between
parties to the proceeding or privies thereto. Manson v.
Williams, 213 U. S. 453, 455.1, This court applied the

principle in Wood v. Davis, 7 Cranch, 271, where a judgment that a mulatto woman was born free was held, as
between strangers, not conclusive that her children were
free. The rule finds abundant illustration in cases dealing
with decedents' estates, Tilt v. Kelsey, 207 U. S. 43, 52;
Brigham v. Fayerweather, 140 Massachusetts, 411; and
-in cases involving the marriage status, Luke v. Hill, 137
Georgia, 159; Burlen v. Shannon, 3 Gray, 387; Wilson v.
Mitchell, 48 Colorado, 454, 469; Corry v. Lackey, 105
Michigan, 363; Belknap v. Stewart, 38 Nebraska, 304;
Gill v. Read, 5 R. I. 343.
Second. The Trustee contends, however, that since by
§§ 18b and 59fI of the Bankruptcy Act, any creditor is
entitled to intervene in the bankruptcy proceedings, the
Bank should be considered a party thereto. These sections are permissive, not mandatory. They give to a
creditor, who fears that he will be prejudiced by an adjudication of bankruptcy, the right to contest the petition. Whether he does so or not, he will be bound, like
the rest of the world, by the judgment, so far as it is
strictly an adjudication of bankruptcy. But he is under
no obligation to intervene, and the existence of the right
is not equivalent to actual intervention. Unless he exercises the right to become a party, he remains a stranger
to the litigation and, as such, unaffected by the decision
of even essential subsidiary issues. In re McCrum, 214
Fed. Rep. 207, 213; Cullinane v. Bank, 123 Iowa, 340,
342. The rule is general that persons who might have

Section 18b provides: "The bankrupt, or any creditor, may appear
and plead to the petition within five days after the return day, or within
such further time as the court may allow." (As amefnded by the Act of
February 5, 1903, c. 487, § 6, 32 Stat. 797, 798.)
Section 59f provides: " Creditors other than original petitioners may
at any time enter their appearance and join in the petition, &r file an
answer and be heard in opposition to the prayer of the petition."

made themselves parties to a litigation between ptrangers,
but did not, are not bound by the judgment.' Compare
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, 247 U. S. 105, 115.
No good reason exists for making an exception in the case
of bankruptcy proceedings.
The purpose of Congress in expressly authorizing creditors, as well as the debtor, to answer an involuntary
petition in bankruptcy was to guard against an improvident adjudication and to protect those whose peculiar
interests might be prejudiced by establishing the status
of bankruptcy. See Blackstone v. Everybody's Store,
207 Fed. Rep. 752, 756; Jackson v. Wauchula Mg. &
Timber Co., 230 Fed. Rep. 409, 411. The grant of this
right of intervention was harmonized with the general
purpose of Congress to secure a prompt adjudication, by
-requiring that the appearance and answers of creditors
be made within five days after the return day on the petition. Had the adjudication been made determinative
also of claims of the several creditors- against the estate
or of claims of the estate against individual creditors,
such expedition in proqeedings would be impossible, if
each of the many widely scattered creditors is to be afforded a fair opportunity to be heard. Furthermore,
to require every creditor to acquaint himself with the
issues raised in every proceeding in bankruptcy against
his debtors, in order to determine whether a decision on
any such issue might conceivably affect his interests;
and, if so, either to participate in the litigation, or, at his
peril, suffer the decision of every question therein litigated
to become res judicataas against him, would be an intolerable hardship upon creditors. And the resulting volume
of litigatioii would often so delay the adjudication as to
defeat the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act.

GRATIOT STATE BANK v. JOHNSON.
246.

Opinion of the Court.

The unreasonableness of the rule contended for by
the Trustee is well illustrated in cases of alleged fraudulent preference. The claim may be made in respect to
any creditor paid off within four months of the filing of
an involuntary petition, that he received a fraudulent
preference. Is every such former creditor to .be deemed
an existing creditor within the meaning of §§ 18b and 59f
and a party to the bankruptcy proceeding? Compare
Keppel v. Tiffin Savi Ts Bank, 197 U. S. 356. 'And shall
the decision of the bankruptcy court be binding on all
these former crediton in respect to individual claims,
although that court could not (without consent) obtain
jurisdiction of any creditor who is not a resident of the
district in which it sits, Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman
Lumber Co., 222 U. S. 300, 311; and would not (prior to
the Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487, §§ 8 & 13, 32 Stat.
797, 798, 800) have had jurisdiction, even as against a resident creditor, of a cla:im to recover a fraudulent preference; such claim being enforceable (without consent)
only in courts of general jurisdiction; Bardes v. Hawarden
Bank, 178 U. S. 524; ,Wall v. Cox, 181 U. S. 244; Jaquith v.
Rowley, 188 U. S. 620; and, even now, only by plenary
suit, Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, 184 U. S. 18; Babbitt v. Dutcher, 216 U. S. 102, 113.
The decisions of the lower federal courts upon which
the state court relied tin holding that §§ i8b and 59f
made all creditors parties to the proceeding so as to render
'Cook v. Robinson, 194 Fed. Rep. 785; In re American Brewing Co.,
112 Fed. Rep. 752; Bear v. Chase,' 99 Fed. Rep. 920. See also Lazarus
v. Eagen, 206 Fed. Rep. 518. In re Hecox, 164 Fed. Rep. 823, also
relied upon, is a case of a different character. There, as in sShawhan
v. Wherritt, 7 How, 627, 643, one not actually a party to the proceeding sought to attack the legislative effect of the adjudication-and
it *as properly held to be conclusive. Hackney v. Hargreaves Bros.
(Hackney v. Raymond Bros. Clarke Co.), 68 Neb. 633, 639, irvolved
only the admissibility of the schedule of liabilities as evidence tending
to prove insolvency.

the., adjudication binding on them as to all essential issues,
clearly misconceived the intention of Congress. The allegation in the involuntary petition that the Bank was
among those who had received preferences, did not impose upon it the duty to appear and answer; and since it
did not do so, even a finding to that effect by the bankruptcy court would not have bound it. The Supreme
Court of Michigan erred in holding that the adjudication
in bankruptcy established conclusively as against the
Bank that the debtor was insolvent at the time the payments were made. We have no occasion to consider
whether the record introduced was admissible merely as
evidence of insolvency.

OF RICHMOND.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.
No. 169.

Argued January 22, 1919.-Decided March 17, 1919.

The City of Richmond is authorized by its charter and the statutes of
Virginia to impose an occupation or license tax on the business of a
telegraph'company done within the city. P. 257.

Under its police power, a State may impose a license tax upon a telegraph company, which has accepted the Act of Congress of July 24,
1866, and is doing both an interstate and a local business, provided
the tax is, restricted in terms to the local business and does not in
effect burden or discriminate against the interstate business. Id.
Where a State requires a telegraph company to engage in intrastate
business, and taxes that business more than the amount of the net
receipts therefrom, so that payment, if compelled, must come in
part from receipts from interstate business, semble, that the tax must
