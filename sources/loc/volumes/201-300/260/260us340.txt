NEW YORK CENTRAL & HUDSON RIVER RAILROAD COMPANY v. KINNEY.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK.

No. 110. Argued November 21, 1922.-Decided December 4, 1922.
Where a: complaint in an action for personal injuries alleges facts
which may, constitute the wrong either under the state law or the
Federal Employers' Liability Act, according to the nature of the
employment, an amendment alleging that the parties at the time
of injury were engaged in interstate commerce does not introduce
a new cause of action, and may be allowed after the two-year
limitation prescribed by ยง 6 of the act has run. P. 345.

CERTIORARI to a, judgment of the Supreme Court of
Newro York, entered on remittitur from the Court of Appeals, affirming a judgment for the plaintiff, Kinney, in
an action for personal injuries against the Railroad Company. There we're several trials in the New York courts
before the amendment passed upon here was made. See

Mr. Mau e C. Spratt, with whom Mr. Herbert W.

tluntindton was' oi the briefs, for petitioner.
The amendment to the complai&t alleging, engagement
of the plaintiff and defendant in interstate commerce
introduced an entirely new cause of action, and hav'ing
been made more than two years after the cause of action
accrued was barred by the statute of limitations contained
in ยง 6 of the federal act. The statute having been

pleaded and proven the defendant was entitled to judgment.
While this Court has upheld amendments where the
original complaint pointed, although imperfectly, to a
cause of action under the laws of Congress, as in Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. Renn, 241 U S. 290, or where the
amendment involved merely the substitution of the personal representative of the deceased, as in Missouri,
Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf, 226 U. S. 570, we do not
find that this Court has yet passed upon the question
where the facts were as here, except that the logic of the
opinion in the Renn Case leads unerringly to the conclusion that under facts similar to those in this case the
amendment would not have been permitted.
No claim has been or can be made that the plaintiff
attempted to maintain or commence any action under the
federal statute for eight years after the cause. of .action
accrued.
The cause of action was based squarely upon the New
York Employers' Liability Act. There was not only an
allegation in the complaint of the service of a notice under
the provision of said act, but a copy of the notice alleged
to have been so served was attached to the complaint.
Furthermore, upon none of the first three trials of this
case was any proof given of interstate commerce nor was
it even suggested that either might have been so engaged.
Nor did the defendant's answer set up engagement in interstate commerce as a defense. For eight years this suit
was absolutely silent as to interstate commerce.
If plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce, then
his original complaint failed to state any cause of action
under the state act, the Federal Employers' Liability Act
being exclusive and superseding all state laws upon the
same subject. By coming into court and alleging that the
plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce, the plaintiff
admits that the action. as brought and three times tried

could not be maintained. It is not merely the addition
of further grounds of liability. It is even more than a
substitution of one cause of action for another. It is the
substitution of the right to maintain an action barred by
the express limitations of the federal statute, in place of
a cause of action in which plaintiff has been substantially
defeated.
Assume that by final judgment the plaintiff had been
defeated in his action under the state act, could he then,
eight years after the accident, successfully institute and
maintain suit under the federal statute?
The original complaint by its plain language excluded
all suggestion of right under the federal statute. The
amended complaint excludes all rights under the state
statute., The cause of action originally pleaded was
wholly inconsistent with the cause of 'action set forth
in the ,amended complaint. Each excludes the other.

sue to recover for the wrong done; and the law to be administered, whether state or federal, is determined by the
facts proved. A sufficient allegation to establish a cause
of action in tort does not necessarily involve the mention
of any statute. Where an action is duly commenced by
the proper party within the time fixed by the statute of
limitations, amendments which do not set up a new cause
of action are within the discretion of the court and are
not controlled by the statute of limitations. A recovery
may be had, where the facts proved warrant it, under the
Federal Employers' Liability Act without an express allegation in the pleadings that the parties are engaged in
interstate commerce, if such proof be made upon the trial
and the defendant be not surprised thereby. An amendment setting up the fact that the parties "at the times and
in the manner above set forth were then and there engaged in interstate commerce" does not set up a new
cause of action..

If the federal law would havd been applied without the
amendment, upon proof of interstate commerce, it would
seem idle to ask this Court to say that the allowance of
guch an amendment, which was justified by the proof,
and which was merely in support of the cause of action
originally alleged, justifies this Court in setting aside the
verdict and granting a new trial. Smith v. Atlantic Coast

MR. JUsTIcm

HOdLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a suit for personal injuries to the plaintiff, the
respondent in this Court, caused by the collision of a train
upon which he was employed by the defendant, the petitioner, as an engineer, with a train of the Michigan Central Railroad Company. After several trials and about
sevenyears and a half after the suit was begun the plaintiff was allowed to amend his complaint by alleging that
at the time of the collision the plaintiff and defendant
were engaged in interstate commerce. He got the present
judgment under the Employers' Liability Act of April 22,
1908, c. 149, 35 Stat: 65; the jury having found that the
parties were so engaged. The defendant contended that
the amendment introduced a mew cause of action and
under ยง 6 of the act could not be allowed after the two
years' limitation had run. See also Act of April 5, 1910,

Opinion of the Court.

c. 143, 36 Stat. 291. A writ of certiorari was granted to

dispose of this doubt.
The original complaint set forth facts that would have
given a cause of action at common law, under the statutes
of New York or the act of Congress, as one or another law
might govern. It alleged a notice, required by the New
York statute and to that extent pointed to that. The
amended complaint, against the petitioner alone, while it
introduced the allegations objected to, retained the allegation as to notice, and was treated by the trial Court,
seemingly with the approval of the higher Courts of the
State, as warranting a recovery under either law as the
jury should find. There is nothing in the statutes of the
United States to prevent this form of pleading, as is indicated incidentally in the case that we are about to cite
upon the main point.
In Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Wulf, 226 U.
S. 570, the declaration was by the mother as sole heir and
next of kin of an employee of the plaintiff in error, in
terms referring to a statute of Kansas giving her a right
of action for injuries resulting in death. An amendment
was allowed, more than two years after the injury, in
which the plaintiff declared both as sole beneficiary and
next of kin, and as administratrix and relied both on the
Kansas law and on the act of Congress. The plaintiff got
a judgment under the act of Congress which was sustained by this Court although the original declaration by
the plaintiff could not be attributed ,to the Employers'
Liability Act, beeausethe plaintiff suied 'nly in her personal capacity and relied for that, as she had to, upon the
Kansasla-T. 226 U. S. 576. It is true that the fact of the
injury arising in interstate commerce was pleaded by the
defendant. But it was pleaded as a bar to the action as it
then stood and only makes more marked the changes that
the amendment introduced. We do not perceive that the
effect of the amendment in that case distinguishes it from

346

260 U.S.

this. It really is a stronger case, because, as we have
said, here the declaration was consistent with a won
under the law of the State or of the United States as the
facts might turn out. The amendment "nmerely expanded or amplified what was alleged in support of the
cause of action already asserted . . . and was not
affected by the intervening lapse of time." Seaboard Air
Line Ry. v. Rennr, 241. U. S. 290, 293. "The facts constituting the tort were the same, whichever law gave them
that effect." Seaboard Air Line Ry.v. Koennecke, 239
U. S.352,354. See also St. Louis, San Francisco& Texas
Ry.Co. v. Smith, 243 U. S. 630. Of course an argument
can be made on the other side, but when a defendant has
had notice from the beginning that the plaintiff sets up
and is trying to enforce a claim against it because of
specified conduct, the reasons for the statute of limitations do not exist, and we are of opinion that a liberal
rule should be applied.
We shall not discuss at length other points that technically are open but that did not induce the granting of
the writ', such as the sufficiency of the evidence that the
parties were engaged in interstate commerce, the instruction as to assumption of risk, &c. We see no sufficient
reason for disturbing the judgment and it must stand.
Judgment affirmed.'
