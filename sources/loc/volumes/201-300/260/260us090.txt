MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the
Court..
Ryan, the claimant and' appellant, by his amended petition in the Court of Claims, sought to recover from the
United States $3,465, being $1.00 per diem from April
16, 1910, to and including October 10, 1919. 'He was
during that period a customs inspector at New York, and
received: $4.00 per day. He says that by law he was
entitled to $5.00 per 'day, and he brings suit to recover the
difference. The Court of Claims gave judgmnent:for the.
Government. The question for our decision is what was

RYAN v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

Ryan's lawful compensation during this period of nine
and a half years.
Ryan entered the customs service as a probationary
junior clerk, Class C, in 1899, after passing a civil service
examination. He was promoted from one place to another
in the service until as the result of a promotion examination he became inspector, Class 2, at $4.00 a day, and
executed an oath as such on April 16, 1910. This appointment was made in pursuance of authority granted
by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Collector at New
York to appoint three inspectors of customs at $4.00 a
day, Class 2. By the same authority 22 more inspectors
of the same class were appointed before Jvly 1, 1910. On
that day, the Collector at New York, with the approval of
the Secretary, effected a reorganization by which 74 inspectors were appointed to Class 2, at $4.00 a day-296
to Class 4 at $5.00 per day, and 52 to Class 5, at $6.00 per
day. The appointment of the claimant and others in
April, 1910, as inspectors of Class 2, $4.00 per day, marked
their entrance into the service, and they were not reappointed under the reorganization but remained as' inspectors of Class 2 under their original appointments.
Was this appointment of Ryan at $4.00 a day authorized by law? Section 2733, Rev. Stats., provides that
each inspector of customs shall receive for every day he
shall be actually e'mployed in aid of customs, $3.00. Section 2737 provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may
increase the compensation of inspectors of cust6ms in
such ports as he may think it advisable so to do, and may
designate, by adding to the present compensation of such
officers, a sum not exceeding $1.00 a day. By Act of
March 3, 1881, c. 132, 21 Stat. 429, the Secretary was given
authority to appoint inspectors of customs at a compensation less than $3.00 per day when in his jidgment the
public service would permit.- There is certainly nothing
in the foregoing provisions, still in force, which prevented

the Secretary from appointing inspectors in New York at
$4.00 a day. By virtue of this authority, before 1902, he
had iiicreased the pay of all inspectors at New York to
$4.00.
By Act of December 16, 1902, _c. 2, 32 Stat. 753, the
Secretary was authorized to increase the compensation of
inspectors of customs at the port of New York as he
might think advisable and proper, by adding to their then
compensation a sum not exceeding $1.00 per day, such
additional compensation to be for work performed at
unusual hours for which no compensation was then
allowed, and as reimbursement of expenses for meals and
transportation while, in, the performance of official duties.
Under the foregoing, in 1903, the Secretary increased the
pay of inspectors then in office in New York to $5.00 per
day, Class 4. The Act of 1902 is wholly permissive in its
language. It does not require an increase of $1.00 a day
or any part of it- to inspectors in New York. It only
authorizes it.
It ig contended, however, that the Act of 1902 has been

construed by Congress in two deficiency appropriation acts,
to be mandatory and to require that -all inspectors ap-

pointed in New York shall receive $5.00 a day. The acts
relied on are that of June 30, -1906, c. 3912, 34 Stat. 634,
636, and that of March 4, 1907, c. 2919, 34 Stat. 1371, 1373.
In" substantially the same language they appropriated
money to pay inspectors of the port of New York -"the
difference between the per diem salary of four dollars
paid them during the months of October, November, and
December, nineteen hundred and five, and their proper
per diem salary for,. the- same period (five dollars per
diem), in accordance with the Act of Congress approved
December sixteenth, nineteen hundred and two." These
deficiency appropriations related to 331 inspectors at New
York whose pay had been fixed at $5.00 a day under the
Act of 1902, prior to October 1, 1905, and which on. that

Opinion of the Court.

date was reduced by the Secretary -bf the Treasury to
$4.00. On January 1, 1906, their pay was increased again

to $5.00.
It wotld be straining provisions of a deficiency act
applying to special instances to hold that it was intended
to change a plainly permissive statute into a mandatory
one. The much more natural interpretation of the language used is that Congress thought that the pay of these
inspectors which had been increased to $5.00 a day under
the Act of 1902 by the Secretary, had thus become fixed
by law and so that the Secretary had no power to reduce
them. This fully satisfies the- words relied on without
amending the statute or making it mean what it plainlydoes not mean.
Counsel for appellant press upon the Court, also, its
decision in Cochnower v.- UnitedStates,248 U. S. 405, as
a basis for recovery here. 'In that case, the claimant, a
customs inspector in New York, had been, with all his
fellows, advanced to $5.00 a day (Class 4), under the Act
of 1902. The Secretary had, thereafter, reduced him and
his fellows to $4.00 a day (Class 2), and counsel for the
Government asserted authority to do this under the Act
of March 4, 1909, c. 314, 35 Stat. 1065, by which the
Recretary was empowered to "increase and fix the compensation of inspectors of customs, as he may think advisable, not to exceed in any case the rate of six dollars per
diem." The Court held-that authority to-increase did not
give authority to decrease, and that as the pay of the
inspectors in that case had been fixed at $5.00, it was the
legal pay and they could recover the balance due. The
Court took the same view which before the Act of 1909
Congress seemed to have taken in the deficiency acts we
have just discussed. Neither the language of Congress
in the deficiency acts nor the Cochnower Case has any
application to the one before us, because here the claimant entered the service as a new appointee at $4.00 a day

-(Class 2), which, as we have seen, the Secretary had full
authority to fix, and his pay was not increased during the
period for which he seeks recovery..

any other question in the record.
