Opinion of the Court.

T, first and third of these cases came on writs of error
sued out by -the United States to review judgments of
District Courts sustaining demurrers to counts of indictments based on sections of the Revised Statutes relating to internal revenue. The, second arose upon. questions certified by the Circuit Court of Appeals in a similar
ease inwhich the-defendant, Brooks, had been convicted.
-Mrs. Mabel Walker' Willebrandt, Assistant Attorney
General, with whom Mr. Solicitor General Beck and Mr.
Howard T. Jones-were on the brief, for the United States.
Mr. Samuel Herrick,with whom Mr. George L. Taylor

was on' the brief, for Brooks.
Mr.,Elijah N. Zoline for defendants-in error in No. 403.
No appearance for defendant in error in No. 26.
MR. JusTcE. HoLmEs- delivered the opinion of the
Court.
In the first of these cases Stafoff was indicted with
another for having had in their possession a still intended
for the production of distilled spirits for beverage and
commercial purposes, without having registered it with
the Collector of Internal Revenue, as required by Rev.
Stats. § 3258; and in a second count for having unlawfully manufactured on premises other than an authorized
distillery a mash fit for theproductiQno_f distilledcspirits,
to wit, whiskey, contrary to Rev. Stats. § 3282. A demurrer to these counts was sustained, 268 Fed. 417, and
the United States brings the case here under the Criminal
Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246.
The case of Brooks comes here on -a certificate. from
the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
Brooks was convicted under. the above mentioned § § 3258
and 3282, and also under Rev. Stats. § 328i for having

Opinion of the. Court.

carried on the business of a distiller without having given
bond as required by law. The third and fourth counts
under § 3282 respectively charged the making of a mash
as above and the separating by distillation of alcoholic
spirits from a fermented mash. The questions certified
are whether the three sections mentioned are repealed by
the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, c. 85,
41 Stat. 305; and whether if they are repealed the cause
should be remanded with directions to enter judgment
and impose sentence under the last named act.
In the third case Remus and his associates were charged
in six counts with having carried on the business of a
wholesale liquor dealer, that of a retail liquor dealer, and
that of a rectifier, without having paid the special tax as
required by law. Rev. Stats. § 3242. A demurrer to
these counts was sustained. 283 Fed. 685. The United
States took a writ of error under the Criminal Appeals
Act.
In United States v. Yuginovich, 256 U. S. 450, it was
decided that §§ 3281 and 3282 were repealed by the later
law, at least as to the production of. liquor for beverage
purposes. Since that decision and with reference to it,
as appears from the House Report, No. 224, 67th Cong.,
1st sess., and the debates, 61 Cong. Rec., Part 3, pp. 3095,
3096, the Act Supplemental to the National Prohibition
Act was passed. Act of November 23, 1921, c. 134, § 5,
42 Stat. 222, 223. By § 5 of this statute "all laws in'
regard to the manufacture and taxation of and traffic in
intoxicating liquor, and all penalties for violations of such
laws that were in force when the National Prohibition
Act was enacted, shall be and continue -in force, as to
both beverage and nonbeverage liquor, except such provisions of such laws as are directly in conflict with any
provision of the National Prohibition Act or of this Act."
(But if an act violates both the former and the latter a
conviction under one is a bar to prosecution under the

other.) This section is not declaratory even in form. It
does not purport to construe the National Prohibition
Act as leaving in force what this Court has declared to
have been repealed. It could not in this way give a
retrospective criminality to acts that were done before it
was passed and that were not criminal except for the
statutes held to have been repealed. Ogden v. Blackledge, 2 Cranch, 272, 277.' Koshkonong v. Burton, 104
U. S. 668. Of course -a statute purporting"to declare the
*inteht of an earlier one might be of great-weight in assisting a Court when 'in doubt, although not entitled to con"trol judicial action. But that is not this case. The decision-in United States'v. Yuginovich must stand- for the
law before November 23, 1921. In -that case, besides
what we hae mentioned, it was held also that the penalty
imposed by R~v. Stats. § 3257. on a distiller for defrauding the United States-of the tax on-'the spirits distilled
b y him was repealed. So far as the liquor is for b'everage
purposes the same reasoning must apply to the penalty
jn § 3242 for carrying on the business of rectifier or.whole"sale or.retail liquor dealer without having paid the special
tax imposed by law.
But the Supplemental Act that we have quoted puts a
ifew face upon later dealings. From the time that it
went into effect it had the same operation as if instead of
saying that the laws referred to &hall'continue in force it
had enacted them in terms. The form of words is not
material when Congress manifests its will that certain
rules 'shill 'govern' henceforth. Swvigart v. Baker, 229
U. S.187, 198. Of course Congress may tax what it also'
forbids: 256 U. S.462. For offenses committed after the
new law, United States v. Yuginovich can not be-relied
upon. Three counts in..the Remus case charge carrying
on the b.simss mentioned up to April 1, 1922, and.therefore are 'governed in part by the Supplemental Act. So
far as the decision- of the Court below neglected this dis-

UNITED STATES v. STAFOFF.

Opinion of the Court.

tinction it was wrong.' The decision in Stafoff's case dealt
with conduct before the date of the SupplementalAct and
was right. The kee pig of a still to make liquor for beverage purposes contrary to § 3258 is within the principle
of the Yuginovich Case, and the addition of the words
"and commercial" to the statement of the purposes -does.
not seem to us enough to take it out. The reference to
this section in Title III, § 9, of the Prohibition Act may
have been inserted simply for greater caution. It is one'
of the several considerations tending to a different conclusion in United States v. Yuginovich, but as they did
not prevail then they cannot prevail now.
There remain the questions certified in Brooks v.
United States. They are somewhat broader than we indicated in our summary statement, as they include the
Revenue Laws generally as well as the §§ -3258, 3281 and.
3282. The general question manifestly is top broad to
require an answer. From the summary given of ,the indictment we infer that what we have said is- sufficient
with regard to the sections named. The fourth questibn,
whether, in view of what we have decided, the case sh6uld
be remanded for judgment and sentence under the National Prohibition Act, must be answered, No. The indictment plainly purported to be drawn under the old law
and it would be unjust to treat the conviction s covering an offense under a law of fundamentally different
policy if facts could be spelled out that might fall within
the latter, although alleged"with no thought of it or any
suggestion to the accused that he must be prephred to
defend against the different charge.
No. 26.. Judgment affirmed.
No. 403. Judgment on counts 2, 4 and 6 affirmed.
Judgment on counts 3, 5 and 7 reversed.
No. 197. Questions 1, 2 and 3, as limited above answered, Yes. Question 4 answered, Nb.
