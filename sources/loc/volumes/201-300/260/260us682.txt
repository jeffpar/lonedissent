transferee of bills of lading for failure to deliver the full
weight of cotton covered by them.
Mr. Edgar Watkins for plaintiff in error.
The Transportation Act 1920, § 206 (a), makes the
limitation in this case "within the periods of limitation
now prescribed by state or federal statutes but not later
than two years from the date of the passage of this Act."
The only fedeial statute that could apply is that contained in Jud. Code, § 24, par. 20. If the federal statute
does not apply, that of the State of the forum must
apply both by the terms of § 206 (a) and under the
decisions of this Court. Chattanooga Foundry & Pipe
Works v. Atlanta, 203 U.- S. 390; § 1538, Rev. Stats.
The shortest applicable Georgia statgjte is four years.
Code § 4368; Southern Express Co. v. Sinclair, 135 Ga.
155. The applicable Alabama statute prescribes a limitation of six years. Code §§ 2615, 4832, 4835 (4); Alabama, etc., R. R. Co. v. Eichofer, 100 Ala. 224. Apply
any of these statutes, and the case is not barred.
Section 206 (a) of the Transportation Act supersedes
all other limitations. To deprive plaintiff in error of its
rights under this section by holding that the time within
which it had to bring suit was governed by a clause in the
bills of lading, would require this Court in effect to read
into the section words which are not there.
No convincing justification can be advanced for an interpretation which ignores the express words used and
deprives plaintiff in error of its rights. Bearing in mind
that the purpose of the section was to afford relief to citizens for damages done them by their government, it is
clear that a liberal construction is more consonant with
justice and more in keeping with the purpose of Congress
than an interpretation which deprives citizens of their
just rights under a plain statute and defeats the expressed
object of Congress.

Argument for Pltainfiff in Error.

260 U. S.

The carriers have filed their tariffs including bills of
lading with Ahe Interstate Commerce CoimnissiOn and
the provisions thereof are binding on all contracts of shipinents of property, whether or not a bill of lading is actuilly issued.. Lazarus v. New York -CentralR. R. Co.; 271
Fed. 93; 278 Fed. 900. Therefore, if the narrow interpretation of the lower courts is affirmed, § 206 (a) can ap.)ly
-Onlly to:" causes of action " for pcrsonal injuries tind for
damagcs to property arisiog other than in transportation.
Such an interpretatioh results in causes of action being
excluded from the section although included in the e'xpress words of'the statute..
Contracts mnade bythe ])irector General and slippers
liswere between tihe government 'nd 'the shippers
souri Pacific R.-B. Co. v. Ault, 256 U. S. 554. 11he lower
-courts in this case have not taken this fact into consid-eration. Lazarus v. New York Central R. R. Co., 271
Fed. 93; 278 Fed. '900, distiniguished.
This Court judicially knows that prior to the Transporlation Act, 1920, shipper with claims against the -Government arising out, of federal control of the railroads wereuncertain how and where to bring suit against''the" Government, as is reflected by the conflicting decisions of the
lower federal courts." At, the time the original suit in
this case was filed marly courts had held that the statu-tory venue fixed by §10 of the FAderal Control Act controlled, while other courts had held that' General Order
No. 18 of the Director General controlled. This co nflilt
was not finally settled by tihis Court until its decision in
Alabama & Vicksbueq Ry. Co. V. Jotrney, 257 U. S. 111.
Thesefacts were before Congress when it piassed § 206
(a),_and since Congress granted the right to .ue and in the
same statute prescribed ' limitation period, it is a proper
assumption that Congress thought a longer period of limnitations on claims arising during federal control was desirable to afford all claimants an adequate opportunity to

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

enforce their rights. The intention of Congress was to fix
a general statute of limitations appli'able to all claims
against the Government arising out of federal cofitrol so
that equal justice might be meted out to all.
The suit here is not. for a failure to deliver property received by a carrier, but for the wrong of the carrier in
issuing a false bill of lading.
The words "loss" and "damage" are broad in their
might itself be broad
signification, and "damage"
enough to include the right to recover for any breach
of a legal duty. These words, however, in transportation, have d conventional meaning clearly, apparent from
the context, and the particular contract sued on here
shows definitely such a meaning and a definite limitation.
If there be any doubt as to the construction of the.
limitation clause, the doubt should be resolved against
the limitation. Lynchburg Cotto . Mill Co. v. Travelers
Insurance Co., 140 Fed. 718; Express Co. v. Caldwell, 21
Wall: 264.
The contract provision limiting the time for suit is
under the facts pleaded unreasonable and void. Decker
& Sons v. Director General, 55 I. C. C. 453. The effect
of the decision of. the Interstate Commerce Commission
is *tonullify all contract limitations then and theretofore
contained in the bills of lading.
It is not doubted and has frequently been held, that
the period of two years in which suits may be filed is
ordinarily a reasonable provision, but the peculidr circumstances in this case, which are similar to the facts
considered by the Commission, show that even if the
contract limitation is applied, it is unreasonable. The
Director General, whom the present agent of the United
States succeeds, and all the railroads of the country were
parties to the judgment of the Commission in' the Decker
Case, supra.
The decision of the Commission holding the particular
contract limitation here relied upon to be unreasonable,

void and in violation of the Act to Regulate Commerce,
becomes the law unless set aside in a direct proceeding.
No such proceeding has been brought and that decision
is now the law binding on all courts- Iiterstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., 222 U. S.
541; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v--. United
States, 232 U. S. 199.
The United States, the real party in interest, by act of
Congress, fixed the'statute of limitation and granted the
right to file this suit. By that statute the United States
disregarded, repealed and set aside any contract limitation. Further, the United States waived the limitation
by" the representations made by the Director General in
Decker v. Director General, 55 I. C. C. 455, 456.
The filing of a former suit containing essentially the
same allegations as this 'suit tolled the statute of limitations. Plaintiff filed its first suit within two years from'
the dates of the bills of lading. The first suit was dismissed because in fixing the venue, § 10 of the Federal
Control Act was literally followed and the orders of the
Director General were not. Ellis v. Atlanta, B. & A.
Ry. Co., 270 Fed. 279. The false bills of lading were
issued March 25,1 26, 1918. A claim for the amount sued
on was filed April 23, 1918. That claim was finally denied July 28, 1919. The suit now before the Court was
fied January 29, 1921. Semmes v. Insurance Co., 13
Wall. 158; Rogers v. Home Insurance Co., 95 Fed. 109.
If the facts found by the Commission are true,--and
we think the law conclusively presumes they are,-the
claimed limitation provisions are, void; if the findings
of the Commission are not conclusive, the issue is one
for a jury.
Order bills of lading are made negotiable by act of
Congress. Act of August 29, 1916, c. 415, 39 Stat. 538;

Sections 20 and 21 of the Bills of Lading Act, suvra,
were inapplicable to these shipments.
If the words "weight (subject to correction)" had any
meaning in the bills of lading sued on, they meant only
such reasonable differences in named and actual weights
as would ordinarily 'occur in twice weighing the same
commodity.
Undr the facts, it was error to dismiss the case because if the law is not as contended for by plaintiff in
error, the facts pleaded require submission to a jury of
both issues.
Mr. Walter T. Colquitt, with whom Mr. Morris Brandon, Mr. John A. Hynds and Mr. A. A. McLaughlin were
on the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JusTIcu HOLmES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a suit upon two bills of lading for failure to deliver the full amount of cotton covered by them. The
plaintiffs allege that they purchased the bills at a rate
determined by the number of pounds specified in the bills
but that on delivery it turned out that the weight of one
hundred bales covered- by one of the bills was 15,312

688

pounds short, and that of two hundred bales coyered by
the, other- was 11,527 pounds short.. The two hundred
bales were delivered to the carrier on ,March 25, 1918,
and the one hundred on March 26, 1918, when the railroads were under federal control. A claim fo this loss
was -made, to the Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic Railroad-, the road over which the cotton was sent, on April
25,. 1918, and, denied by the Road bn July 28, 1919,
This suit ws begun on January 29, 1921, more than two
years and a day after the' short delivery. The bills of
lading which were in the same general form provided that
"suits for loss, damage or delay shall -be'instituted only
within two years and one day after delivery of the prop-.
erty, or in case. of failure to make delivery, then within
two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed." They also stated the weight "'subject to correction.", The -District Court -after careful
consideration dismissed the petition upon demurrer, on
the ground that the suit was too late under the quoted
words of the contract, and also, on the merits. 274 Fed.
443. :The Circuit Court -of Appeals aTirmed the judgment, adopting the opinion below as to the time within
which the suit 'mustbe brought. 276 Fed. 400.
We find it unnecessary to consider other defences besides the contract limitation, as we agree with the Courts
below that that disposes of the case. The main objection
urged is that the contract is overridden by § 206(a) of
the Transportation Act, February 28; 1920, c. 91, 41
Stat. 456, 461, giving actions in cases like this against
an agent designated by the President, and providing that
they may be. brought within the periods of limitation
now prescribed by state or federal statutes, but not later
than two years from the date of the passage of the act.
supported- with some ingenuity but.
The. contention ,.i

was to"-linit not t-o extend rights of action and that we

cannot suppose that it was intended to invalidate existing
contracts good when made. New York Central R. R. Co.
v. Lazarus, 278 Fed. 900; William F. Mosser Co. v. Payne
(W. Va.), 114 S. E. 365; Northern Milling Co. v. Davis
(Wise.), 190 N. W. 351. In our opinion this contract
was good when made. The time allowed was reasonable.
Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co. v. Harriman, 227
U. S. 657, 672. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Leatherwood,
250 U. S. 478, 481. We agree with the District Court
that Decker &.Sons v. Director General, 55 I. C. C. 453,
should not be understood or allowed to contravene our
conclusion, upon the facts here. The statutes of the
States where the goods were shipped and the suit was
brought do not affect the contract, and the reasonableness of the limitation is a matter of law; Missouri, Kansas
& Texas Ry. Co. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657, 672, so
that the bringing of a previous suit, alleged in the declaration, does not save the case. Riddlesbargerv. Hartford
Insurance Co., 7 Wall. 386.
The only other argument that seems to us to need
notice is that the claim is not within the words of the
limitation. But- it is of the kind that the clause "suits
for loss, damage or delay" manifestly intended to limit
and we see no reason why it should not be included under
the head of loss.
