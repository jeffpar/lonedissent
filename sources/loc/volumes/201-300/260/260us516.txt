Statement of the Case.

260 U. S.

,The method of calculation adopted by the Treasury
follows the clear language of the act, and its correctness
is conEfirmed by the statement, and the illustrative tables,
preseted by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in submittmg the Conference Report on the bill.
55 Cong. Rec., 65.th:'Cong., 1st sess., Part 7 pp. 75807593. As the language of the act is clear, there is no
room for the argument of plaintiff drawn from other
revenue measures. Nor is there anything in La-'Belle
Iron Works v United-,States, 256 U S. 377 383-388,
which lends support-to plaintiff's contention.
Affirmed.

THE -WESTE I _DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

No. 102. Argued November 16, 1922.--Decided January 2, 1923.
1. An order of the District Court quashing the summons in an action
against a foreign corporation upon the ground that the defendant
was not found m the State is m effect a final judgment, reviewable
here under Jud. Code, ยง 238. P 517'
2. Purchases of goods by a foreign. corporation for sale at its domicile, and visits by its, oicers on business related to such purchases,
are not enough to 'warrant the inference that it is present within
the 3urisdiction of the State where such purchases and visits are
made; and service of summons on its president while temporarily
in that State on such business is, therefore, void. P 517
3. The fact that the'cause of action arose in the State of suit will
-not-confer jurisdiction of, a foreign corporation not found there.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. George H Haris for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Jacob H. Corn, with whom Mr. IsaacSiegel was on
the brief, for defendant in error.
MR. JusTicE, BR-AN.Is delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Rosenberg Bros.*& Company, Inc., a New York corporation, brought this suit in the Supreme Court of that
State against Curtis Brown Company, an Oklahoma corporation. The only service of process made was by delivery of a summons to defendant's president while he was
temporarily in New York. Defendant appeared specially; moved to quash the summons on the ground that
the corporation was not found within, the State; and,
after evidence was taken but before hearing on the motion, removed the case to the federal court for the Western District of New York. There, the motion to quash
was granted, upon the ground i at the defendant was not
amenable to the process of the state court at the time, of
the service of the summdns. A writ of error wassued out
under ยง 238 of the Judicial Code; and the question of
jurisdiction wqs'duly certified. The order entered below,
although in form an order to quash the summons and not
a dismissal of the suit, is a final judgment; and the case is
properly here. Goldey v. Morning News, 156 U. S., 518;
Conley v. Mathieson Alkali Works,' 190 U. S.406. Compare The Pesaro, 255 V. S. 216, 217.
The sole question for decision is whether, at the time
of the service of process, defendant was doing business
within the State of New York in such manner and to such
extent as to warrant the inference that it was present
there. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibbin,
243 U. S.264, 265. The District Court found that it was
not. That decision was clearly correct. The Curtis Brown

Opinion of th_ Court.

260 U.S.

Company is a- small retail lealer in mens,,clqthing and
furnishings at Tulsa, Oklahoma. It never applied, under
the: foreign corporation laws, for a license-fto do business
'in New York; nor did it at: any time authtize suit to be
brought, againstl-it there. It never had an established
place of business in New York; nor did it, without having
such established -place, regularly carry on business -there.
It -had no property in New York;, and had ,no officer,
agent or,stockholder resident there. -Its- 'nly connection
with New-York appears-to have benithe purchase there
frbm, time to time-of a-large part-of.the merchandiso to be
store in Tulsa. The purchases were made,
sold',-4 tisometimes -by corr sp-0ndence, , inetimes through: visits
to NewYork of one of 'itsofficers.,-: Whether, at the time
its president ,was served with process, he was in New York
oiybusinessor forpleasure; whether he was then authorized to transact any bufsiness there; and to what extent
he, did transact bdsiness-,"while there, ar_ questions on
:which-much -eviden.6e was introduced; and 8ome pf it-is
conflicting. Butthe issues so raised are not of-legalsignificanc. The only business. alleged to have been transiacted by the company Iin; New York, either then or
theretofore, related to-such purchaseK of goods by officers
aforeign corporation. Visits on'such business, even
:.of:
if occurring at xegujar intervalsj, would not warrant the
,inference that, the -corporation was present within the
-jurisdiction of the -State. Compare International Harvester Co. v. Kentucky; 234 U; S. 579; People's Tobacco
Co. v.,America, Tobaceo Co.,-246 U. S.79. And as it was
not found there, thefact that the alleged cause of action
immaterial. Compare, Chipman,
arose in New .York -is
,Limited v. Thomas B. Jeffery Co., 251 U.- S. 373, 379.
Affirmed.
