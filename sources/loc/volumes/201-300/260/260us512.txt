fundamaental purpose of the Sherman Act was to secure
equality of opportunity and to protect the public against
evils commonly incident to destruction of competition
through monopolies and -combinations in restramt of
trade. The alleged actioois of defendants are directly
opposed to this beneficent -purpose and are denounced by
the statute.
We find no adequate support for the clain that plaintiffs were parties to. the combination of which they now

The Greenport Company had, in 1917, an invested
capital of $215,615.55. Its net income was $76,361.20 in
the taxable year ending October 31, 1917. Its prewar
annual net income, calculated on a 7 per cent. basis, Was
$15,093.08; and the fixed statutory deduction $3,000.
The company was thu subject (for five-sixth of the year)
to the excess profits tax imposed by the Revenue Act of
October 3, 1917, c. 63, §§ 201, 203, 40 Stat. 300, 303, 304.1
The Government, following Treasury Regulation No. 41;
Articles 16, 17, and form 1103, assessed the tax at $16,837.76. The company insisted that the correct amount
was $12,417.36; paid the tax as assessed, under protest;
and brought this suit for the difference, $4,420.40, in the
'Section 201: "That in addition to the taxes under existing law
and under this act there shall be levied, assessed, collected, and paid
for each taxable year upon the income of every corporation, partnership, or individual, a tax . . . equal to the following percentages of the net income:
"Twenty per centum of the amount of the net income in excess
of the deduction (determined as hereinafter provided) and not in

U.S '489; J. Homer Fritch, Inc. v. 'United States, 248
U. S. 458. The sole question presehid for decision IS.
whether the method of calculating the taxes adopted by
the Treasury is in harmony with the provisions of the
Reyenue Act.; :-,.
The rate ,ofexaction impqsed by the excess profits tax
grows in stages, with the- increase in the percentage
earned oi, the capital. In the first stager-net income up
tq45 per cent, on capital-the rate of exaction is fourtwentieth.:, In the second-stage-net income frgo- 15 to
20 per cent.--the,,rate is five-twentieth. In the third
stage.net-come from 20 to 25 per cent.-the rate is
seven-twentieth. In the fourth stage-net income from
25 to 33 per cent,-the rate is, ine-twentieth. In the
last stag-,-,net incpme, over 3-3- per cent.-the rate is
twelve-twentieth. What the net income is to which the
respective rates of exaction applylis the question for decision-.iThe- comp-any +contends,' ii_effect,_th&t _net in-"Forty-five per centum of the amount of the net income in excess
of twenty-five per centum and not in excess of, thirty-three per

come as -used concerning each stage,. means not the whole
net income-but the balance remaining after deducting
from the net income the allowance for prewar profits and
the fixed deduction. Under this contention the base to
which the exactions should be applied would be, not
$76,361.20, but that sum less $18,093.08, or $58,268.12.
The Government insists that the exaction should be applied to the whole net income, except that from the net
income prescribed for the first stage the allowances specifically provided for are to be deducted.- The differences
in detail resulting from the two methods of calculation
are shown in the margin.'

Statement of the Case.

260 U. S.

,The method of calculation adopted by the Treasury
follows the clear language of the act, and its correctness
is conEfirmed by the statement, and the illustrative tables,
preseted by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in submittmg the Conference Report on the bill.
55 Cong. Rec., 65.th:'Cong., 1st sess., Part 7 pp. 75807593. As the language of the act is clear, there is no
room for the argument of plaintiff drawn from other
revenue measures. Nor is there anything in La-'Belle
Iron Works v United-,States, 256 U S. 377 383-388,
which lends support-to plaintiff's contention.

here under Jud. Code, § 238. P 517'
2. Purchases of goods by a foreign. corporation for sale at its domicile, and visits by its, oicers on business related to such purchases,
are not enough to 'warrant the inference that it is present within
the 3urisdiction of the State where such purchases and visits are
made; and service of summons on its president while temporarily
in that State on such business is, therefore, void. P 517
