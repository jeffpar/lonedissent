delivered the opinion of the

Court.
These five cases were heardtogetlier anid present largely
the same questions of law. Each is an appeal from a
decree entered by a federal District Court for North Carolina under § 266 of the Judicial Code denying an interlocutory injunction. In each a railroad company engaged
in interstitte commerce seeks to enjoin the taxing officials
from collecting the ad valorem property taxes for the year
1921, imposed for local purposes, and the franchise tax
imposed for state purposes. Some of the corporations
plaintiff are foreign; some, domestic. One has its lines
wholly within the State; four have lines also in other
States. But these differences are without legal significance in this connection. The property taxes are assailed
on the ground that, as assessed, they violate the equal
protection clause, the due process clause, and the coinmerce clause of the Federal Constitution, the uniformity
provision of the state constitution, and the statutory
method of valuation. The franchise taxes are assailed oti

the ground that the statute under which they are laid
violates the commerce clause, the equal protection clause,
and the due process clause of the Federal Constitution, as
well as-the uniformity clause of the state constitution;
that the amounts of these taxes were illegally calculated,
in violation of the statutes of the State; and that since
they are fixed by a percentage of the ad valorem valuations, they must fall because those valuations were
illegally made. Many of the objections made raise questions as to the meaning and effect of recent statutes of
the State which have not yet been construed by its courts;
and we are reluctant to pass upon these questions. Some
of the objectionsraise issues of fact on which the evidence
is. submitted by affidavit and is in certain respects conflicting. But in all the cases jurisdiction rests upon: substantial federal questions. The objections to the validity
of the legislation and of the assessments, whether -arising.
out of the Federal Constitution or out of the constitution
or statutes of the State, may be presented in a single suit.
We must, therefore, determine state, as well as federal,
questions.. Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Powers, 201

All the objections urged have been considered. We are
of opinion- that none of them should be sustained. The
more important ones will be discussed.
The controversy arose in this way.1 By the constitution of North Carolina taxation of real and personal
property must be uniform and ad valorem "according to

its true value in money." In the assessments made prior
to 1920 nearly all classes of property had been grossly
undervalued; but the undervaluation varied greatly in
degree. The Revaluation Act of 1919, Public Laws, 1919;
c. 84, was passed in order to provide for new and fundamentally changed valuations of all property at full values.
The valuation of real estate was to be made by county
officials; that of railroad property by a state board under
an application of the unit rule; and the assessment so
made was to be allocated by the state board to the counties
on a mileage basis.2 By that act the valuations made by
these taxing boards were to become effective as assessments only upon approval by the legislature. When so
approved, they were to be the basis of the taxation for the
years 1920 to 1923 inclusive. Revaluations of real estate
and ot railroads were made under that act and were approved by the legislature in August, 1920. Public Laws,
1920, c. 1. Through these revaluations the assessments
of railroad property were, on the average,, doubled, as
compared with the assessments prevailing in 1919;3 and

1921; Act of December 19, 1921, to refund tax illegally assessed.
'Prior to 1921 railroad property was valued and assessed (apart
from the action by the legislature in 1920) by the State Tax Commission. In 1921 the powers of the State Tax Commission were
transferred to the Department of Revenue under a Commissioner
of Revenue. In this opinion "state board" is used throughout to
refer to state authorities as distinguished from county boards which
assessed local real estate.
'The increases were: Southern Railway $46,869,942 to $96,605,694;
Atlantic & Yadkin Railway, $1,975,806 to $4,104,710; Seaboard Railway, $20,191,720 to $34,768,440; Atlantic Coast Line Railway,

those -of real estate were quadrupled. The aggregate
assessrhent of all the railroad properties as revalued in
1920 was $250,587,158; the aggregate of the real estate
$2,006,124,997; that of the personal property $807,866,443; "and that of'industrial and financial institutions
$444,748,145.
The-relatively larger increase in'the revaluations of real
estate and of other property resulted ih railroad' taxes for
1920 lower than had prevailed theretofore; and these
taxes were duly paid.. But widespread objection to continuing the 1920 revaluations as'a basis for the taxation of
real estate developed in-the latter part of 1920. A severe
depression in business had occurred; there was an abrupt
decline in commodity prices, particularly farm products ,
and real estate values were affected by this decline. The
legislature, thereupoi, made provision, Public Laws, 1921,
c. 38, § 28, under which, upon application ,of taxpayers,
the 1920 revaluations of real estate could be reviewed by
county boaids and those of railroad property by the state
board. These boards were authorized to make corrections
w herever, assessments were found to exceed existing
values. By proceedings under the Act of 1921 reductions
were made in 67 counties, varying from 1 to 50 per cent.
in'the valuations of real estate (including that belonging
to the railroads not used in, the transportation service).
In 33 counties no reduction in the valuations of real estate
was allowed. The -legislature of 1921 had made no provision for reviewing the revaluations of personal property; and the assessments thereon remained unchanged,
although the valuations of 'personalty had* also been
greatly increased in 1920. Under the Transportation Act,
1920, the Interstate Commerce Commission issued, in the
latter part of 1920, orders pursuant to Ei parte 74, Increased Rates, 58 I. C. C. 220; raising freight rates in
North Carolina 25 per cent. and passenger rates 20 per
cent. over those prevailing when the revaluatio'n of 1920

was made. Thereafter, the five railroads applied to the
state board for reduction of their valuations as the basis
for taxation in 1921 and .subsequent years. The application of the Norfolk & Southern was granted in part;
and its assessment was reduced. from $27,023,462 to
$22,840,932. But, after due hearing, and rehearings, the
state board refused to modify the assessments of the other
four railroads which had been fixed by the legislature of
1920. Thereupon these suits were begun.
The contention of the railroads that the property taxes
as assessed are obnoxious to the Federal Constitution was
rested here mainly on the claim that there is a denial of
equal protection of the laws. This claim is asserted on
several grounds. It is contended, in the first place, that
the Act of 1921 providing for the review of valuations is
void. The argument is that the railroads were discriminated against, because real estate owners are given an
appeal on assessments from the county board to the State
Board of Equalization, but that no such appeal is provided from the assessment of railroads. It is also argued
that there is discrimination in this: While c. 38, § 28g,
provides for reduction by the state board in the valuation
of", railroad only where it applies therefor, reductions
in the value of all real estate within the county were,
under § 28a,to be made provisionally, if the county board
determined that the 1920 valuation was, as a whole, in
excess of a fair value; and that in such event the percentage of the average excess would be applied to each
parcel in the county, unless and until the assessment of
individual real estate owners should be revised by the
State Tax Commission. The differences in the classes of
property, and in the conditions of ownership, obviously
made difference in treatment unavoidable. Differences in
the machinery for assessment or equalization do not constitute 'a denial of equal protection of the laws. New
York State v. Barker, 179 U. S.279.

6OCTOBER TERM,. 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

260 U. S.

The claim that plaintiffs have been denied equal protection of -the laws appears, to rest more largely on the
charge _that discrimination has been practiced against
them in administering the tax laws. - It is urged that
county boards, proceeding under ,§ 28a'of the-Act of 1921,
reduced real estate valuations quite generally, _but that
the state bqard, acting: under § 2 8$g, refused to reduce the
valuation of any railroad except tat of the Norfolk &
Southern. The rule. is well settled- that a taxpayer, although assessedon not more. than full value, :may be
unlawfully,- discriminated -against by undervaluation of
property_ of the same, class belonging to.others. Raymond v. Chicago Union Traction Co.) 207 U. S. 20. This.,
may be- true- although the discrimination is j racticed
through the action-of different officials. Greene V. Louisville & InterurbanR. R.,Co., 244 U. $. 499. But, unless
it is-shown that therundervaluati6n was intentional and
systematic; unequal assessment will not be held to violate
the equality clause. Sunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield,
247 U. S. 350, 353; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Ry. Co.
v. Babcock, 204 U. S. 585; Coulter v. Louisville & Nashyue R .
O.,. 196 U. S-,,599; Sioux City Bridge Co. v.
Dakota County, ante, 441. Plaiftiffs have clearly failed
to, establish that the.e, was intentional and systematic
undervaluation by the county boards. Strong-evidence
to the contrary is furnished by the fact that in 33
counties, including those in which the largest cities are
located, no reductioniwas made in the valuation of real
estateand that in the renaining 67 counties the reduction varied from,1 to, 50 per cent. Plaintiffs have failed,
likewise, in showing_ systematic refusal on the part of
the state board to allow a -proper reduction in the valuation of:; any railroad. The further contention that
by reduction of the Norfolk & Southern's assessment
the other plaintiffs ,were discriminated against is also
unfounded.

52T,

Opinion of the Court.

The claims that the assessments made by the legislature
in 1920 violate the due process and commerce clauses of
the Federal Constitution and the true value and uniformity clauses of the state constitution, rest largely upon
the contentions that the valuations were made on wrong
principles and are excessive. There was ample opportunity to be heard; and the opportunity was availed of.
There is no suggestion of bad faith. At the most there
have been errors of judgment; and mere errors of judgment are not subject to review in these proceedings.
Pittsburg, -Cincinnati,Chicago & St. Louis Ry- Co. v.
Backus, 154 U. S. 421; Brooklyn City R. R. Co. v. New
York, 199 U. S. 48, 52. There was no taxation of interstate commerce. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams,
Tdggart,
155 U. S.688; Western Union Telegraph C6, !..
163 U. S. 1. There is not shown any taxation of property
without the State as in Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66.
Because these several. constitutional objections are, in our
opinion, unfounded, we do not deem it necessary to consider the contention of defendants that tlere was open to
plaintiffs the opportunity of reviewing the assessments in
the state courts by writ of certiorari, and that, unless and
until such remedy had been exhaasted, there was no right
to seek relief by these bills in equity. See Keokuk &
Hamilton Bridge Co. V. Salm, 258 U. S.122, 125. _
The claim that the railroads' property taxes are void
under the statutes of the State seems to rest, in th e main,
on the charge that in valuing them in 1920, and in passing
upon the application for reduction under the Act of 1921,
the state board failed to follow the method of valuation
prescribed. It is argued, among other things, that there
was no separate assessment, of tangible and intangiblo
property; or if so, that plaintiffs were not notified as to'
,what that separation was; that there was no due consid,
eration of the actual cost of replacement of the property,
uith just allowance for depreciation of rolling stock; that.

the franchise ior intangible value was not assessed by. a
due consideration of the gross earnings as compared with
operating expenses, -or of the market value of 'the stocks
and bonds,; that the particular method presciibed by the
statutes for' assessing interstate roads was not followed;
and thatierroneous methods,-of valuation were-adopted.
To these. contentions, there appedr. 'to be several answers.
The Revaluation Act -did -not make mandatory any particilar'. method of :valuation, The legislature recognized

The data
like 'the methods 'of valuation referred to -in earlier. and
later :lkgislation,, are among those ,commonly used 'Vhen,"
an attempt is' made to ascertain the value of a railroad.
But they 'are merely aids. Such data; are commonly in
the possession ofthe railroad companies; and are often
not, readily- accessible, to others., -The legislature by the
Revaluation Act authorized the state board to require the
railroads to furnish the information. But it did not undertake to prescribe to what-extent or how the information should be used-by them.: Their duty was merely'to
exercise an informed and honest judgment in fixingvalues
for purposes of taxation. Compare Minnesota Rate
Cases, 230 U. S,. 352, 434. Another answer to plaintiffs'
contention is that mere failure to follow methods 'of valuation referred t*6 in earlier statutes could not, in any event,
render illegal the revaluation made by the state board in
1920P since itwas,:by the Revaluation Act, made tentative
merely. That tentative valuation became an assessment
by the legislature, and, hence the law, through approval
by c. 1, Laws Extrat Session, 1920, which made it the assessment for the'next four years. The state board, when
applied to in1921, had power to reduce the statutory
'assessment;'but in acting on the applications it was not,

as we read the statutes, required to make a new valuation,
or to apply any particular method of-valuation.4
The railroad franchise tax, equal to one-tenth of one
per cent. of the value of the company's property within
the State, .is imposed wholly for the support of the state
government. Such taxes are expressly authorized by the
state constitution, Article V. Before 1920, the contribution of railroads toward the expenses of the state, government was made partly by a small privilege tax dependent
on gross earnings per mile, partly from a percentage of
the ad valorem property tax paid by them; and in valuing
railroad property there was included among the intangibles what is frequently called the franchise or the corporate excess. In 1920 this mileage privilege tax was
abolished; payment for general state purposes of a percentage of the property tax was discontinued; and by § 82
(612) of c. 1, Laws Extra Session, 1920, and Revenue Act
4The following statutory provisions show that no assessment was
made by the State Tax Commission in 1920 or 1921 or by the Commissioner of Revenue in 1921, but that the assessment was made by
the legislature in 1920. The only power of the Commissioner of
Revenue in 1921 was to make reductions in certain cages.
Revaluation Act, Public Laws, 1919, c. 84, § 6, provided that all
real property should be valued as of May 1, 1919, and such value
should be used for all tax purposes for 1920, 1921, 1922, and 1923.
Section 31 provided for a complete, revaluation of all railroad companies to be used as the basis for computing taxes for such companies
for 1920, 1921, 1922 and 1923. Section 3 provided that the assessment made under said act was not to be used as a basis for computation of taxes until it had been approved by the legislature.
Act of Special Session, 1920, c. 1, § 1, approved the "assessment orvaluation" made under Revaluation Act of 1919 and adopted it as
the basis for levy of tax rates by the State and all subdivisions thereof
for 1920, and the valuation of real property so fixed was adopted
for 1921, 1922 and 1923, "except as such valuations may be hereafter changed according to law."
Machinery Act, Public Laws, 1921, o. 38, § 64, 'provided for the
valuation of railroads (laying down rules therefor) "at such dates
as real estate is required to be assessed for 'taxation."

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

260 U. S.

of 1921, c. 34, the so-called franchise tax here in question
was imposed. It is argued that this franchise tax is an
additional property tax, which is not imposed on others,
and that, consequently, it violates the uniformity clause of
the, state constitution and the equal protection clause of
the Federal Cdnstitution. It is true that the franchise tax
is measured by-the value of property already subjected to
the-ad vaiorem tax. But a privilege tax is not converted
into a propergy tax: because it is meAsured by the value of
property (compare Clark v. Titusville, 184 U. S. 329, :333,
334); nor by the':fac t that in this measure is included
property not: used iii'the transportation service. Railroads-differ in so mainy respects from other properties that
they may, as a class, be -aked differently or additionally, if
that is not inconsistent with the constitution 6f :the State.
Nor is there any basis for .the claim that the franchise
tax act violates' the commerce clause. The-tax appears to
be-up-n .he- privile-ge of doifli an -Ttratte-husiness.
Compare Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, 200-U. S 226. It
is not of the charactpr which is held a burden upon interstate commerce., St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co,-v. ,Arkansas, 235, U. S. 350-. Underwood Typewriter Co. v.
Chamberlain,254 U. S.113, 119, 120;- St. Louis-Sant Francisco Ry-Co. v. Middlekamp, 256 U. S. 226. Payment of
the tax is not made a'condition precedent to granting 'a
railroad permissioh to do interstate business. Compare
Leloup v. Mobile, 1271U. S.-640. Underwo6d Typewriter
Co. y., hamberlain 254, U. S.113, 119. And there is no
basis for the contention that the: aggregate burden imposed by the property .tax,-the franchise -tax,and the income tax, operates to-obstruct interstate commerce, .
The Temaining objections to the franchise taxes relate
merely to the amounts!'at which they Are calculated>- It
is insisted that § 82 (3 ) of the Revenue Act of 1921
applies, and-that therefore upon the facts stated tIe 'tax
should be for one-twentieth, not for one-tenth, of one
per cent. of the value of the company's property within

Opinion of ihe Court.

the State. The Norfolk & Southern, insisting likewise
that the section applies, argues that the taxes assessed
upon others thereunder would be only one-half the percentage it is required to pay, and, therefore, contends that
the act denies to it equal protection of the laws. Upon
ihis question of statutory construction the courts of the
State have not yet passed. The taxing officials insist that
§ 82 (31) has no application to railroads; and in support
of their contention point to the history of the legislation.
We think that they are right.
A further objection' peculiar to the Atlantic & Yadkin
Railway should be mentioned. This road is located
wholly within North Carolina. Its entire capital stock
is owned by the Southern; and it is operated as a part
of the Southern System. The state board assessed all
the lines operated by the Southern System at 8101,*;
960,413, and then apportioned to the Atlantic & Yadkin
the sum of $4,104,710, a sum..alleged to be grossly excessive. Defendants aver that the amount represents the
actual value of the property. They say, further that
the apportionment was made in accordance with the plan
suggested by the tax commissioner of the Southern System; that neither the Southern Railway nor the Atlantic
& Yadkin was, in any way, prejudiced by assessing the
property together; or by allocating this amount to the
latter; that if the Atlantic & Yadkin was overassessed,
the Southern was, to that extent, underassessed; and that
the company is estopped by its conduct from questioning
the assessment on this ground. A doubt is raised whether
the taxes assessed upon this plaintiff should be sustained.
But even if the objection can be availed of in this suit,
the state of the record is not such as to justify us in reversing, on this ground, the decree denying an interlocutory injunction to the Atlantic & Yadkin. It will,
of course, be open to thisplaintiff to renew the objection
upon the final hearing.A
