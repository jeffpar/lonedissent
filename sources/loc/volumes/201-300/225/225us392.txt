BROWN v. ELLIOTT, UNITED STATES MARSHAL IN AND FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, et al.
MOORE v. ELLIOTT, UNITED STATES MARSHAL
IN AND FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF
CALIFORNIA.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.

Nos. 201, 202.

Argued October 19, 1911. Reargued May 1, 1912.-Decided June 10, 1912.

If the indictment under § 5440, Rev. Stat., sufficiently charges the
.commission of overt acts within the district, it is sufficient even
if it states that the place where the conspiracy formed is unknown.
The Sixth Amendment, to the Constitution -does not preclude the
place of trial of conspirators indicted under § 5440, Rev. Stat., being
in any State where an -overt act was performed. Hyde v. United
States, ante, p. 347.
A conspiracy entered into in violationt of § 5440, Rev. Stat., may
be a continuous crime, and, if it. was designed to be, and was, continuous, every overt act was the act of all the conspirators by reason
of the terms of their unlawful plot.
Where there are successive overt acts during the existence of the conspiracy, the period of limitation must be computed from the date
of the last of them properly specified in the indictment, although
some of them may have occurred more than three years before the
indictment was found.
The Constitution of the United States is not intended as a facility
for crime, but to prevent oppression; its letter and its spirit are satisfied if where a criininal purpose is executed that criminal purpose be
punished. The criminal himself makes the venue of his trial.

THE facts, which involve the validity of an indictment

under §5440 Rev. Stat., are stated in the opinion.

225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

The Solicitor General for appellee.
MR.

JUSTICE

MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the

court.
These appeals involve the action of the Circuit Court in
dismissing petitions for writs of habeas corpus to discharge
appellants from the custody of appellee, United States
Marshal for the Northern District of California. Both
appellants were held under a warrant of removal made by
the District Court of that district upon an order of commitment made by a United States commissioner in proceedings for the removal of appellants to the District Court
of Nebraska.
There was an indictment found against appellants in
the District Court of the Omaha Division of the District
.of Nebraska for the crime of conspiracy, in which it was
charged that they and others whose names, aliases and
the numbers by which they were designated as part of
the means of effecting the scheme, and who in the indictment are called "conspirators," "on the fifth day of April,
in the year of 6ur Lord one thousand nine hundred and
seven, did then and there" conspire with Ernest Fenby
*and other persons to the grand jurors unknown "to commit the acts made offenses and crimes by §.5480 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended by an
Act of Congress enacted March 2, 1889 (25 Stat. 873,
c. 393) entitled 'An Act to punish dealers and pretended
dealers in counterfeit money and other fraudulent devices
for using the United States mails.'" And it is charged
that appellants and the other persons conspired in devising
and intending to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud
various persons'out of their money and property, to be
effected by means of the post-office establishment of the
United States, and particularly to defraud certain persons
who were named. To avoid repetition, they are called in

the indictment "victims," and they were to be defrauded
of their money and property by the conspirators "agreeing
to organize, institute, conduct and manage certain horse
races and athletic contests

.

.

. as wagering contests

upon which money should be bet," at Council Bluffs, in
Iowa, and in certain places in Missouri, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana and Washington, and other places to
the grand jurors unknown, and "at Omaha, district
aforesaid." The races and contests were to be conducted
in a fraudulent, unfair and dishonest manner and to be
controlled solely by the conspirators so that the outcome
was known in advance, with intention thereby to defraud
the victims. The charge is made with much circumstance
and detail which it is not necessary to repeat except to say
that the conspirators were to be represented as millionaires traveling through the United States making investments in municipal, county and city bonds, and in other
projects, and having with them horses, and athletes for
their private amusement which they would match with
those of strangers. One of the conspirators was to be
represented to be the secretary to the others and as having
charge of the contests which he had theretofore always
managed with great financial profit and gain as well as
to the amusement of his employers, but that he had become aggrieved at the treatment he had received and
would so manage the contests that the horses and athletes
of the millionaires would lose, and that he was desirous
of betting against them and thereby win their money for
himself and for such other persons as would bet for him as
his secret agents. Others of the conspirators were to represent themselves to the victims to be friends and relatives of,
the "secretary" and had been requested by him to procure
men of financial standing to act as his secret agents in
betting money against his employers, the millionaires,
and it was to be represented that it was necessary for him
to procure such persons of financial standing and respon-

Opinion of the Court.

sibility to represent him and bet his money in order to
conceal his disloyalty to his employers. Such
persons
were not to bet their own money but the secretary's
money, and be paid a percentage of the winnings. The
victims were to be induced to bring letters of credit or
negotiable paper for large sums of money and thereby
establish credit in the bank of the town where the races
and contests were to be conducted. And when they,
relying on the fraudulent representations of the secretary,
should bet and wager money. furnished by him they were
to be informed that the money was not in fact his but was
his employers' money; that they, the employers, had or
might become suspicious that the money was not that of
the victims and the secretary not the stakeholder, and to
prevent criminal prosecutions the races and contests
would be called off; that therefore it would be necessary
for the victims to come to his (the secretary's) rescue
and bet their money for him and allay such suspicions
and to insure the races and contests proceeding to a finish
as arranged, the money to be returned after the races
and contests. And it was to be represented that the races
and contests terminated unfortunately through an unusual
and deplorable accident, to wit, a serious injury to one
of the jockeys or one of the athletes and in such way that
it would be unfair to declare themselves winners, and
additional races and contests were to be conducted in the
same manner and an opportunity afforded to win back
the money lost. Finally it was to be represented to the
victims that they had been engaged in a criminal transaction, which had resulted in a serious injury to a person,
and to avoid arrest and criminal prosecution they (the
victims) were to depart from the scene, and lave the
money bet With the secretary, who was to convert it to
the use and gain of the conspirators. And this was alleged
to be fraudulent and done with intention to deceive, etc.
The manner- of- carrying out the scheme was alleged

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

to be to rent a United States post-office box for the delivery of the mail in the United States post-office at Omaha,
Nebraska, and in other cities throughout the United States
where any of the conspirators should establish headquarters in furtherance of the scheme and artifice to defraud, and the conspirators were to assume and request
to be addressed by the number of such boxes respectively
and carry on their correspondence with each other through
and by means of the post-office establishment of the United
States by the use of such assumed title numbers without
the use of their own proper names, and to assume other
names and request their victims to address them by such
assumed names through and by means of the post-office
establishment of the United States. And it is charged
that the conspirators, in further execution of their scheme,
were to take and receive letters so addressed from and
out of the United States post-office at Omaha and other
places which were mentioned and that they were to write
and send letters to one another by means of the post-office
establishment which were to contain and set forth their
fraudulent and deceitful schemes and were to be shown
to the other victims for the purpose of inducing the latter
to turn over to the conspirators large sums of money.
The conspirators, it is charged, also used the post-office
establishment to open correspondence with the victims
and to procure them to open correspondence with two
of the conspirators, whose names are given, in pursuance
of the conspiracy.
It is alleged "that the said wicked and corrupt conspiracy, combination, confederation and agreement was
originally formed and entered into by the said conspirators
during the year 1905, the exact date whereof is to the
grand jurors unknown, in the United States of America,
the exact place'and district whereof is to the grand jurors
unknown, and until the twenty-third day of February,
in the year nineteen hundred and nine, continuously and

225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

at all times during the four years next preceding the said
twenty-third day of February," it, the conspiracy, "was
continuously in existence and in the process of execution
and operation and including all of said times, and the said
conspirators did knowingly, falsely, wickedly and corruptly conspire, combine, confederate and agree together
as aforesaid, and with said Ernest Fenby and said divers
other persons to the grand jurors unknown, as aforesaid."
Overt acts are alleged, one of which is the renting by
one of the conspirators under an assumed name of a postoffice box at Omaha, Nebraska, and the receiving and
sending of letters to the "victims," which set forth the
scheme in detail by which the "millionaires" were to be
imposed on and the ease of its accomplishment and as,surance of success displayed. The indictment contains
copies of the letters.
. The second count of the indictment alleged the conspiracy to have been formed on the first of April, 1907,
and the scheme of fraud and deception was set forth in a
more general way.. The use of the post-office establishmentwas alleged, as in the first count.
The original formation of the conspiracy was alleged,
as in the first count, to have been in a place and district
to the grand jurors unknown, but was continuously in
existence and in process of execution for four years next
preceding the twenty-third of 'February, 1909. The overt
act alleged was the depositing of a letter by one'of the conspirators in the post-office at Omaha, Nebraska, which
letter concerned the-scheme and artifice to defraud and
to effect the object of the conspiracy.
It will be observed that it is charged that appellants
and those named in the indictment as "conspirators,"
"on April 5 ,' r 1907 (first count), "did then and there,"
and "on April 1," 1907 (second count),. "did then and
there" conspire with Ernest Fenby and others, and that
races and contests upon which money was to be bet were

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

to be organized "at Council Bluffs, in the State of Iowa,"
and that the conspirators "further then and there, and
at Omaha, district aforesaid," were to execute their
scheme. And it is charged that the conspiracy was to be
effected in the manner described and that the conspirators,
further to effect the object of the conspiracy, were "to
rent a United States post office box for the delivery of
mail, in the United States post office at Omaha, in the
State of Nebraska, district aforesaid," and in other places.
The first overt act charged in pursuance of the conspiracy on the fifth of April, 1907, is the renting of such
box. To effect the Object of the conspiracy formed on
April 1, 1907, the first overt act is alleged to have been
done in July, 1907, at Omaha.
It is, however, also alleged that the conspiracy was
originally formed and entered into during the year 1905
in the United States, the exact date and place being unknown, and was continuously in existence and in the
process of execution and operation during the four years
preceding the twenty-third of February, 1909.
The assignments of error present the contentions that
the indictment is essentially deficient in the following
particulars:
1. It does not allege that the conspiracy was formed in
Nebraska, but, on the contrary, alleges that it was formed
at some place unknown to the grand jury.
2. It does not allege in any of its counts that the first
overt acts were done in Nebraska, but that they were done
in a place and district unknown.
3. The indictment shows that the conspiracies were
formed more than three years prior to the finding of the
indictment.
4. It does not allege that appellants consciously participated in any overt act within three years next preceding
the finding of the indictment.
The first two contentions involve the jurisdiction of the

BROWN v. ELLIOTT.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

court under the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of
the United States requiring a crime to be tried in the
State and district where it was committed. The third and
fourth contentions raise the question of the statute of limitatiQns.
First, as to what the indictment shows as to the formation of the conspiracy and the commission of overt acts.
The appellants consider these propositions entirely upon
the assumption' that the only allegation that can be regarded is that which charges the formation of the conspiracy originally in 1905, and not the allegation of the
formation of a conspiracy in 1907.
But nothing is specifically alleged as having been done
to execute the conspiracy as originally formed. It is true,
there is an allegation that the conspiracy was in existence
and in the process of execution and operation, which is
somewhat vague but is certainly 'not inconsistent with
the fact that whatever was done, if anything, was done at
Omaha.
It is charged that on Aprir 5, 1907 (first count), and on
April 1, 1907 (second count), the appellants and other
persons "did then and there" conspire (we omit the adverbs). This might well be contended, so far as removal
proceedings are concerned, as an allegation of the formation of the conspiracy in the district of Nebraska, or certainly a distinct and explicit renewal of it. And it would
seem like giving technicality too much effect to consider
that the agreement made in 1905, rather than its specific
and formal renewal in 1907, should determine the jurisdiction of its trial. Besides, its continued 'existence and
operation are alleged, and we have seen if overt acts were
done prior to 1907 they may have been done at Omaha
and constituted, with those done afterwards, a part of an
entire scheme, to be executed by a succession of acts.
It is only by the assumption and insistence that the
conspiracy was formed in 1905 that appellants give their

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

contentions any foundation whatever. If the conspiracy
was forned at Omaha in 1907, upon the supposition that
the conspiracy constitutes the offense and the State and
district of its origin are the State and district of its trial,
the District Court of Nebraska had jurisdiction. And
again, upon the supposition that the first overt act completes the offense commenced by the conspiracy and by
completing it determines the place of its trial, the District
Court of Nebraska had jurisdiction. This follows, no
matter where the overt act was done. We have pointed
out, hvowever, that the indictment does not show that the
first overt act was done at a place and district unknown.
The first overt act may have been performed at Omaha.
If either view, therefore, be accepted, the judgment of
the Circuit Court dismissing the petitions for habeas corpus
must be affirmed.
If, however, we assume with .appellants that the indictment charges that the conspiracy was formed in 1905 and
at a place unknown to the grand jurors, the same result
must be pronounced, upon the authority of Hyde v.
The United States, just. decided, ante, p. 347. We. there
held that the place of trial could be any State and district
where an overt act was performed. And we further held,
following United States v. Kissel; 218 U. S. 601, that conspiracy might be a continuous crime. We there said, distinguishing a crime from its results: "But when the plot
contemplates bringing to pass a continuing. result that
will not continue without the continuous co6peration of
the :conspirators to keep it up, and there is such continuous co6peration, it is a perversion of natural thought
and of natural language to call such continuous cooperation a cinematographic series of distinct conspiracies,
rather than to call it a single one." These remarks are
especially pertinent to the case at bar. It is alleged in the
indictment that the conspiracy set forth was designed to
be and was continuous, and, being so, every overt act

BROWN v. ELLIOTT.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

was the act of all the conspirators, made so by the terms
and force of their unlawful plot.
In Lonabaugh v. United States, 179 Fed. Rep. 476, the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit considered
the relation of the overt acts to the conspiracy and their
effect in determining the application of the statute of
limitations. The court said (p. 478), by Mr. Justice Van
Devanter, then Circuit JudgE: "While the gravamen of
the offense is the conspiracy, the terms of section 5440
are such that there also must be an overt act to make the
offense complete (Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 76); and so
the period of limitation must be computed from the date
of the overt act rather than the formation of the conspiracy. And where during the existence of the conspiracy
there are successive overt acts, the period of limitation
must be computed from the date of the last of them of
which there is appropriate allegation and proof, and this
although some of the earlier acts may have occurred more
than three years before the indictment was found. Lorenz
v. United States, 24 App. D. C. 337, 387; S. C., 196 U. S.
640; Ware v. United States, 84 C. C. A. 503, 154 Fed. Rep.
577, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1053; S. C., 207 U. S. 588; Jones
v. United States, 89 C. C. A. 303, 162 Fed. Rep. 417;
S. C., 212 U. S. 576."
If, however, the conspiracies may De regarded as distinct, then one is charged as having been formed at Omaha
in April, 1907, and that overt acts were performed there
to effect its object within three years of the finding of
the indictment; to wit, October 7, 1909. These allegations
establish the jurisdiction of the District Court of Nebraska
and exclude the application of the statute of limitations.
As the place of the overt act may be the place of jurisdiction, it follows that the exact place where the conspiracy was formed need not be alleged. This case illustrates the evil which a contrary ruling would cause.
The place where the conspiracy was formed was unknown

to the grand jurors (and might be so in many cases), but
it was intended to be executed in a number of States of
the Union, and yet, under the rigor of the contention
of appellants, the conspirators could not be tried in any of
them. In other words, not the place of the activities of
the conspiracy and where it incurs guilt, but the place of
its formation, which no one may know or can find out,
is the place of the jurisdiction of its trial. And what
compels this? It is answered: The Sixth Amendment of
the Constitution of the United States. We have determined otherwise in Hyde v. United States, ante, p. 347.
The Constitution of the United States is not intended
as a facility for crime. It is intended to prevent oppression, and its letter and its spirit are satisfied if where a
criminal purpose is executed the criminal purpose be
punished. It is there that its victims are sought and defrauded. It is there that its perpetrators should be brought
to the bar of justice for their acts; not for the mere conception of them, but for the actual execution of them.
The venue of his trial is thus made by the criminal himself, not determined by reasons or interests which may be
adverse to him and used to his injury.
Orders dismissing petitions affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES, dissenting.

These are appeals from orders denying writs of habeas
corpus on the same state of facts, which can be set out
in a few words. The petitioners were taken into custody
in California for removal to Omaha, in the District of
Nebraska, for trial before the District Court there, and
severally petitioned for habeas corpus on the ground that
the indictment showed that the Omaha court had no
jurisdiction of the alleged offence. The indictment is
under Rev. Stat. § 5440,. amended by. Act of May 17,
1879, c. 8, 21 Stat. 4, for conspiring to commit an offense

BROWN v. ELLIOTT.
225 U. S.

HOLMES, J., dissenting.

against the United States, namely, to send and receive
letters through the post-office in pursuance of a complex
scheme to defraud various people, contrary to Rev. Stat.
§ 5480; amended by act of March 2, 1889, c. 393, 25 Stat.
873. The scheme contemplated the hiring of post-office
boxes at Omaha and other places, in six different States;
and the hiring of a box there and the posting and receiving
of letters in that place by conspirators other than the petitioners are alleged as overt acts done in pursuance of the
scheme. But it is alleged that the place where the conspiracy was formed is unknown, no place is laid for its
continuance, and the petitioners are not shown to have
been engaged in it in Omaha or ever to have been in the
place. Therefore no jurisdiction is shown unless the averment of the above-mentioned overt acts makes up for all
that is left out.
To deny the jurisdiction, however, I must go farther
than was necessary in Hyde v. United States, just decided.
For in this case the offense against the United States
named as the proximate object of the conspiracy, viz.
the sending of letters through the post-office in aid of the
ultimately intended fraud, is alleged to have been accomplished, and indeed is laid a the overt act. But all the
parties to the conspiracy could have been indicted in
Omaha for the use of the post-office there in pursuance of
their plan by some of their number, and it naturally may
be asked how it can be possible that the petitioners should
be collectively guilty of unlawfully using the mails in
Omaha, but not guilty of being combined there for that
purpose.
The answer has been suggested at least by what I have
said in the case of Hyde. The parties are liable to punishment where the prohibited act is done, not on the ground
of a fiction that they were present, but in spite of the fact
that they were not present. And they well may be dealt
with there if they can be reached, for bringing about what

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

is deemed a harm in that place. But when they are punished for being and not for doing, when the offence consists in no act beyond the osmose of mutual understanding, they should be punished only where they are, only
where the wrongful relation exists. The United States
can reach them equally, it is true, in either case, but as it
can try them only where the crime has been committed,
the test to be applied is the same that would be applied
if the crime arose under the law of one of the States. It
does not follow from the defendants' liability in Omaha
for certain results of their conspiracy that they can be
tried there for the conspiracy itself. I assume for purposes
of decision, whatever misgivings may be felt as to the
justice of indicting for a conspiracy to do what actually
has been done, that an indictment will lie. Reg. v. Button,
11 Q. B. 929. United States v. McDonald, 3 Dillon, 543.
United States v. Rindskopf, 6 Biss. 259. United States v.
De Grieff, 16 Blatchf. 20. R. v. Spragg, 2 Burr. 993. But
I am of opinion that Omaha is not the proper jurisdictionin which to bring it.
If the case were decided on the narrow ground that for
the purposes of removal an allegation of conspiracy 'then
and there' in the middle of the indictment was to be taken
to refer to the caption and the place where the indictment
was found, I should say nothing. But as general principles are thought to be involved, I think it proper to
state my opinion about them.
MR. JUSTICE LURTON, MR. JUSTICE HUGHES and MR.
JUSTICE LAMAR concur in these views.
