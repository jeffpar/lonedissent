the terms of the dontract or that it was not duly certified
under ยง 2104, and so it does not appear that the payment
was not in accordance with the decree as construed oil the
prior appeal.
What really was sought by the supplemental petition
was a modification of the decree in a particular wherein
it had been affirmed by this court. But the Court of
Claims was without power to grant any such relief, for it,
like any other court whose judgment or decree has been
reviewed by this court, was bound to give effect to the
rule stated in In re Sanford Fork and Tool Co., 160 U. S.
247, 255:
"When a case has been once decided by this court on

appeal, and remanded to the Circuit Court, whatever was
before this court, and disposed of by its decree, is considered as finally settled. The Circuit Court is bound by
the decree as the law of the case; and must carry it into
execution, according to the mandate. That court cannot
vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution;
or give any other or further relief; or review it, even for
apparent error, upon any matter decided on appeal; or
intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has
been remanded."

Decree affirmed.

APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
No. t1. Argued November 9, 1911.-Decided June 10, 1912.

Under ยง 2 of the act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489, c.120,-and other

.provisions of that act, the predecessor in title of the Union Pacific
Railroad Company acquired a right of way four hundred feet in

width across the lands in Kansas, within the Delaware Diminished
Indian Reservation, those lands having been assigned in severalty
to individual Delawares under the treaty of May 30, 1860, 12 Stat.
1129, providing for such right of way.
Quwre. Whether the individual Delaware Indians, to whom the lands
were assigned under the treaty of 1860, obtained a better or different
right in them than the tribe had in the lands in common.
QL/xre. Whether under ยง 2 of the act of July, 1862, the United States,
in extinguishing the Indian title to lands through which the railroads
were given rights of way, is to bear the burden by compensating the
Indians, or only by assisting in the negotiations.
While the phrase "public lands" is a term ordinarily used to designate
lands subject to sale under general laws, it is sometimes used in a
larger sense, and as used in ยง 2 of the act of July, 1862, it includes
lands within Indian reservations. Congress so intended and such
has been the construction placed on the words by the Interior De-.
partment.
Where an Executive Department has constantly given the same construction to a statute affecting title to real estate, rights acquired
thereunder will not be lightly disturbed after a lapse of many years.
Purchasers of land, over which a railroad has been constructed and
operated, cannot claim that they purchased without notice of the
claim of the railroad to own the right of way.
Where a railroad company enters upon the land of another and constructs a railroad thereover, under a statute entitling it to do so on
condition that compensation be made to the owner, and the latter
permits the construction and operation of the railroad without compliance with that cohdition, a subsequent vendee of the owner
takes the land subject to the burden of the right of way, and ihe
right to exact payment therefor from the railroad company belongs
to the owner at the time of entry and construction.
168 Fed. Rep. 648, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the right of the Union Pacific
Railroad Company to certain portions of its right of way
within the Delaware Diminished Reservation, are stated
in the opinion.
Mr. Edward D. Osborn, with whom Mr. A. M. 'Iarvey

the lands in question. See treaty proclaimed March 24,
1831, 7 Stat. 357; treaty of 1854, 10 Stat. 1048; treaty of
1860, 12 Stat. 1129.
The design of the treaty of 1854, as accomplished by the
treaty of 1860, was to vest the individual Delawares with
property right in the lands allotted to them in severalty.
The quality of descendibility to successors was imparted
to the land. There was, as in all land treaties with Indians,
an understood, even if unexpressed, intent to educate the
Indians into the habits of civilized life by individual
ownership instead of communal occupancy. A full equitable title to the allotted lands became vested in the individual Delawares. Jones v. Meehan, 175 U. 5. 1; Francis
v. Francis,203 U. S. 233.
Where a grant is made to one "and his heirs" a restriction on alienation either partial or entire does not debase
the grant to a mere right of occupancy, but a vested interest passes thereby under the cover and protection of
the constitutional guaranties of property right. Libby v.
Clark, 118 U. S. 250; United States v. Paine Lumber Co.,
206 U. S. 467; S. C., 154 Fed. Rep. 263; United States v.
Cook, 19 Wall. 591; Shiver v. United States, 159 U. S. 491.
As an Indian allottee's interest in the land is a vested
property right, Congress is. lacking the power to make a
grant through it of a railroad right-of-way without making
provision for compensation therefor. Jones v. Meehan,
175 U. S. 1; Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. R.
Co., 135 U. S. 641.
The act does not purport or intend to grant a right-ofway through the lands in question, but only "through the
public lands." At the time of its enactment the lands involved were not public lands nor were they merely lands
conceded and guaranteed to the Indians as a perpetual
home by express treaty; they had but a few months before
been allotted in severalty to the individual members of
the tribe. The question is not, "Could Congress grant

KINDRED v. UNION PACIFIC R. R. CO.
225 U. S.

Argument for Appellants.

the right-of-way over these lands?", but "Did Congress
do so?"
Congressional grants of land are not to be regarded as
including lands which have been reserved or appropriated
by the United States for any purpose whatever, even
though they be not expressly excepted by the language.of
the grant. L. L. & G. R. Co. v. United States, 92 U. S. 733;
M., K. & T. Ry. Co. v. United States, 92 U. S. 760; Beecher
v. Wetherly, 95 U. S. 717; Spokane Falls & N. Ry. Co. v.
Ziegler, 61 Fed. Rep. 392; United States v. Sioux City Ry.
Co., 46 Fed. Rep. 502; Scott v. Carew, 196 U. S. 100.
Grants of lands or rights out of the "public lands" are
to be construed as excluding lands otherwise reserved or
appropriated, unless a contrary intent is clearly and positively expressed. Wilcox-v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498; Bardon
v. Nor. Pac. R. Co., 145 U. S. 535; Northern Lumber Co. v.
O'Brien, 71 C. C. A. 598; 139 Fed. Rep. 614, affirmed,
204 U. S. 190.
To give the act of July 1, 1862, the effect contended
for by the appellee is to abrogate the treaty of 1860 with
the Delaware Nation. A treaty of the United States,
whether made with a foreign nation or with an Indian
tribe, has the force of law equally with an act of Congress.
Congress may abrogate such treaties, ag it may, repeal
statutes, but in neither case is repeal or abrogation by
implication favored. Unless the intent of Congress toabrogate the treaty is. clear and undoubted from the
language of the act, unless it admits of no other reasonable
construction, it will not be construed as abrogating the
treaty. Chew Heong v. United States, .112 U. S. 536;

This rule of construction applies to right-of-way grants.
Washington & I. R. Co. v. Osborn, 160 U. S. 103; Union
Pac. R. Co. v. Harris, 215 U. S. 386.
Appellee's authorities do not support its contention
that a different rule of construction is applicable to rightof-way grants. See Railroad Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125;
Bybee v. Oregon Ry. Co., 26 Fed. Rep. 586.
The extinguishment clause is not an adequate expression
of the intent of Congress to deprive the Indians of a part
of the land that had been set apart and granted for their
separate perpetual use, and to give it to the railroad company. Atl. & Pac. R. Co. v. Mingus, 165 U. S. 413.
The generally accepted construction put upon such extinguishment clauses is that its effect is to extend the
grant to wild, unceded Indian lands occupied by the Indians under their original right of occupancy, but not to
lands expressly reserved for their occupation or use by
treaty. Buttz v. Nor. Pac. R. Co., 119 U. S. 55; Caldwell

States, 92 U. S. 733; Nor. Pac. R. Co. v. Hinchman, 53

This is the settled ruling of the Department of the
Interior as to the similar extinguishment clause in the
Northern Pacific grant. Dillone v. Nor. Pac. R. R. Co.,

The construction given to a statute by those charged
with its execution has much weight and ought not to be
overruled without cogent reasons. The decisions of the
Department of the Interior in regard to the construction
and effect of statutes relating to congressional grants of
the public domain, especially when followed consistently
for many years, will be accepted by the courts as correct,
unless obviously wrong. United States v. Hammers, 221

The predecessors in title of the appellee accepted the
benefits of the act of July 1, 1862, and thereby became
subject to its limitations, as well those upon the original
grant of July 1, 1862, as those upon the grants contained
in the amendatory act itself. See Humbird v. Avery, 195
U. S. 480; Heydenfeldt v. Davey G. & S. Mining Co., 93
U. S. 634.
By accepting an additional grant of powers or franchises,
a corporation becomes subject to new restrictions imposed
by the granting act. St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Chadwick, 6

Verde Canal Co., 27 Land Dec. 421.
Mr. Maxwell Evarts for appellee:
At the time of the Pacific Railroad Act of July 1, 1862,
the Delaware Indians were the wards of the Nation and
had only a right of occupancy to the lands in the Delaware
Reservation, and such lands were at the time public lands
of the United States within the meaning of the second
and ninth sections of said act of 1862.
Moreover, the policy of the General Government
has
always been that the United States, and the United States
alone, should have dealings with the Indians-its wards.
Neither the railroads nor individuals were permitted to
extinguish, by purchase or in any other way, any right of
occupancy which the Indians might have in the lands of
the United States. For this reason, therefore, such lands
must be deemed to be public lands, so far as the people of
the United States are concerned, with the right in the
Government alone to extinguish the Indian title whenever
such lands were necessary for purposes other than the
occupancy thereof by the Indians. Johnson v. M'Intosh,
8 Wheat. 543, 585; Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet.
1, 17; Jones V. Meehan, 175 U. S. 1, 8.
The expression "Indian title" is perhaps misleading,
and was not intended to convey the idea that the Indians
had title to their lands in the usual meaning of the term,
but only a right to live on them, subject to whatever
disposition the United States might see fit to make of
them. Veale v. Maynes, 23 Kansas, 1, 23; Cherokee Nationv. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1.
To understand the peculiar relations of the United
States and of the Indians to the wild lands of the country,
the treaties with the Delawares must be considered. See

Stat. 327; May 6, 1854, 10 Stat. 1048; May 30, 1860,
12 Stat. 1129.
. The treaties in Veale v.Maynes, (23 Kansas) with the
Pottawatomie Indians were substantially the same as the
treaties with the Delaware Indians, and the question
then before Mr.Justice Brewer was precisely the question
which is now presented to this court.
The Pottawatomie Treaty of 1867, 15 Stat. 531, is
practically similar to the Delaware Treaty of 1866, 14
Stat. 793.
Mr. Justice Brewer held that, the allotment of the land
to the Pottawatomie Indians under the Treaty of 1861
made no change in the relation of the Indians of that
Tribe to the land in controversy, except that the land
instead of being held in tribal occupancy was to be held
in personal or individual occupancy, and that no enlargement of the right of the Indians to occupy the land was to
be found until the right to a patent in fee simple was given
to them under the treaty of 1867.
The argument of Mr. Justice Brewer in the Veale Case
is precisely the argument of appellees, that the Delaware
Indians had no other, further or greater right to their
lands by reason of the Treaty of 1860 than they had before.
. The treaties with the Delaware Tribe show
that up to
the time of the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 the Delawares
had no claim whatever to the land in 'question except
a right of occupancy at the will of the United States.
See Ninth Article, Treaty of July 4, 1866, 14 Stat. 793,
796.
The question, however, of the right of the Leavenworth
Company and its successors to the right of way across the
lands of the Delawares is no longer open for determination

under the language of the treaties, but has long since-become an established rule of property in the State of Kansas, under the decisions of its highest court. Grinter v.

Kansas, 556; S.C., 35 Kansas, 717; Union Pacific Ry. Co.
v. Kindre4 43 Kansas, 134, 135.
The Iha4as to whom the allotments were made under
the treaty oi 1860, 12 Stat. 1129, have already been paid
for the right of way granted to the Leavenworth Company
and they and their successors in title have no claim of any
kind to the lands in question. See Art. 3 of Delaware
Treaty of 1860; act of July 1, 1862, supra; act of July 13,
1892, 27 Stat. 120, 126; United States v. Un. Pac. Ry. Co.,
84 Fed. Rep. 1022; United States v. Un. Pac.Ry. Co., 168
U. S.505.
No right of way by adverse possession has been acquired by the appellants or any of them to any portion
of the right of way granted to the Leavenworth Company
under the act of July 1, 1862.
Congress alone was the judge of the width of the right
of way required by the grantee corporation. Nor. Pac.

whether the appellee, the Union Pacific Railroad Company, has a right of way 400 feet in width across certain
lands in the State of Kansas, formerly within the Delaware

Opinion of the Court.

Diminished Indian Reservation. The facts out of which
the question arises are these::
By the treaty of 1829, 7 Stat. 327, with the Delaware
Indians it was provided that certain lands in the fork of
the Kansas and Missouri rivers should be "conveyed and
forever secured" to those Indians "as their permanent
residence." By the treaty of May 6, 1854, 10 Stat. 1048,
parts of the reservation so established were relinquished
and the remainder retained for a "permanent home."
Article 11 of this treaty decla:red that at the request of the
Delawares the diminished reservation should be surveyed
and each person or family assigned such portion as the
principal men of the tribe should designate, the assignments to be uniform; and Art. 12 provided that railroad
companies, when their lines of railroad necessarily passed
through the diminished reservation, should have a right
of way on payment of a just compensation. The treaty
of May 30, 1860, 12 Stat. 1129, after reciting such a request as was contemplated by the preceding treaty, provided that 80 acres of the diminished reservation should
be assigned and set apart for the exclusive use and benefit
of each Delaware and his heirs; that the tracts assigned
should not be alienable in fee, [eased or otherwise disposed.
of, except to the United States or to other members of the
tribe, and should be exempt from levy, taxation, sale or
forfeiture until otherwise provided by Congress; and that
if any Delaware should abandon the tract assigned to
him the Secretary of the Interior should take such action
in respect of its disposition as in his judgment might seem
proper. Article 3 of this treaty gave to the Leavenworth,
Pawnee & Western Railroad Company, a Kansas corporation, a preferred right to purchase the unassigned
lands in the reservation, and declared: "It is also agreed
that the said railroad company shall have the perpetual
right of way over any portion of the lands allotted to the
Delawares in severalty, on the payment of a just compen-

sation therefor, in money, to the respective parties whose
lands are crossed by the line of railroad."
The act of July 1, 1862, 12 Stat. 489, c. 120, relating to
the location, construction and maintenance of the Union
Pacific and other railroads, authorized the Leavenworth,
Pawnee & Western Railroad Company, before mentioned,
to locate, construct and maintain a railroad from the
Missouri river, at the motith of the Kansas river in Kansas,
to a connection with the Union Pacific Railroad on the
100th meridian of longitude in Nebraska, and granted to
it, as also to other companies named in the act, a right of
way in the following terms:
"SEC. 2. That the right of"Way through the public lands
be, and the same is hereby, 'granted to said company for
the construction of said railroad and telegraph line; and
the right, power, and authority is hereby given to said
company to take from the public lands adjacent to the
line of said road, earth, stone, timber and other materials
for the construction thereof; said right of way is granted
to said railroad tothe extentof two hundred feet inwidthon
each side ofsaid railroad where it may pass over the public lands, including all necessary grounds for stations, buildings, workshops, and depots, machine shops, switches, side
tracks, turntables, and water stations. The United States
'shall extinguish as rapidly as may be the Indian titles to all
lands falling under the operation of this act and required
for the said right of way and grants hereinafter made."
Other portions of the act required the Leavenworth,
Pawnee & Western Railroad Company to file with the
Secretary of the Interior within six months after the date
of the act an acceptance of its conditions and within two
years after such date a map of the general route of its road,
and to complete 100 miles, commencing at the mouth of
the Kansas river, within two years after such acceptance,
and 100 miles per year thereafter until completion; and
made provision for an official examination and approval

KINDRED v. UNION' PACIFIC R. R. CO.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of the completed road in sections of 40 consecutive miles.
The company seasonably filed an acceptance of the conditions of the act and a map of the general route of its road
showing that the route extended from the mouth of the
Kansas river to and across the Delaware Diminished
Reservation. That part of the road was constructed on
that route and put into operation within two years from
tho date of the act, and was duly examined and approved
by the proper officers of the United States. Under congressional authority the route for the remaining part of
the road was subsequently changed so that the connection
with the Union Pacific Railroad would be made at a point
farther west than was originally intended, and the later
construction conformed to this change, but this has no
bearing here. The appellee, the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, became in 1898, and now is, the successor in
interest and title of the Leavenworth, Pawnee & Western
Railroad Company.
By the treaty of July 4, 1866, 14 Stat. 793, provision
was made for the removal of the Delawares from their
home on the diminished reservation to lands secured for
them in the Indian Territory, and for the sale by the
United States of the lands in the reservation, whether held
in common or assigned in severalty, with the qualification
that assignees electing to dissolve their tribal relations
and become citizens of the United States might retain the
tracts assigned to them and ultimately receive patents in
fee simple with power of alienation. On receiving payment for the lands sold the United States was to issue
patents therefor to the purchaser or his assigns, and apply
the proceeds to the benefit of the tribe or the assignees,
depending upon whether the particular lands were held
in common or had been assigned in severalty. The intended removal was effected, the reservation was extinguished, and the lands therein, including most of those
assigned in severalty, were sold as intended.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

The lands through which the asserted right of way here
in controversy extends were within the diminished reservation at the date of the act of 1862, had then been assigned in severalty to individual Delawares under the
treaty of 1860, were sold by the United States under the
treaty of 1866, and are now claimed by the appellants
through mesne. conveyances under the patents issued to
the purchaser at that sale. The railroad was located and
constructed across these lands without the payment of
any compensation for the right of way. But, so far as
appears, no attempt was made by the tribe, the individual
assignees, or the United States to prevent the location
and construction, and no controversy arose between them
and the railroad company, save as there was a dispute as
to whether the assignees were entitled to compensation,
and, if so, as to who should pay it. See Grintnerv. Kansas
PacificRailway Co., 23 Kansas, 642; Id. 659; United States
v. Union Pacific Railway Co., 168 U. S. 505. In 1892
Congress recognized the right of the assignees to be compensated for the right of way, and made an appropriation
to pay them, accompanying it with a direction to the
Attorney General to institute proceedings against the
railroad company to compel it to reimburse the Government. See 27 Stat. 120, 126, c. 164; United States v. Union
Pacific Railway Co., supra.
The Circuit Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals
sustained the railroad company's claim to a right of way
400 feet in width, 168 Fed. Rep. 648, and the present owners of the tracts affected prosecute this appeal.
It was contended in the courts below, and the contention is repeated here, that the individual Indians to whom
the lands were assigned in severalty obtained no better
or different right in them than the tribe had in the lands
held in common; in other words, that the right was one of
possession or occupancy only, the United States remaining
the real proprietor and having full power to terminate the

KINDRED v. UNION PACIFIC R. R. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

Indian right at will. But, without passing upon that
contention, we think it may well be assumed for the purposes of this case that the assignees, although not possessing the legal title and not promised a conveyance of it,
had something more than the ordinary right-of possession
or occupancy of tribal Indians in lands set apart for tribal
use. We say this, because the right of the assignees, whatever it may have been, was acquired and held under the
treaty of 1860, wherein it was agreed that the Leavenworth, Pawnee & Western Railroad Company should have
a perpetual right ofway over any of the lands assigned in
severalty, on the payment of a just compensation to those
whose lands were crossed by its railroad. It therefore is
not as if Congress had undertaken to grant a right of way
through these lands without either the assent of the assignees or any provision for compensating them. As respects these lands, the right-of-way section in the act of
1862 did not stand alone, but was to be taken in connection with the treaty provision. The two, together, meant
that the right of way was granted, not merely by the
United States, but with the assent of the Indian assignees,
and that the latter were to be justly compensated. The
only uncertainty, if any, introduced into the situation
arose from the presence in the right-of-way section of the
promise on the part of the United States that it would
as rapidly as might be extinguish the Indian title to all
lands required for the right of way. This seems to have
given rise to a question, whether the United States was
to bear the burden of extinguishing the title, as by compensating the Indians therefor, or only to assist in obtaining it, as by conducting negotiations with the Indians
in respect of the compensation to be paid to them. But
we are not here concerned with that question, because the
right under the treaty to have the compensation seasonably ascertained and paid by whomsoever was liable
therefor was not insisted upon.. No steps to that end

were taken, but, on the contrary, the construction of the
railroad was permitted to proceed and the road was
completed and. put into operation as a public highway at
least three years before the lands were sold under the
treaty of 1866.
But it is said that the right-of-way section was inapplicable because it was confined to "public lands," a term
used to designate such lands as are subject to sale or other
disposal under general laws. No doubt'such is its ordinary meaning, but it sometimes is used in a larger and different sense. We think that is the case here, first, because
the provision in the same section, that the United States
should extinguish as rapidly as might be the Indian title
to all lands required for the right of way, implies that
Indian lands as to which Congress properly could grant
a right of way were intended to be included, and, second,
because the section was so interpreted by the Executive
Department charged with the administration of the act,
as also of affairs pertaining to the Indians and public
lands,, and rights acquired thereunder ought not lightly
to be disturbed after the lapse of so many years.
It results that the sole irregularity in respect of the
acquisition of the right of way contemplated by the treaty
provision and the statute, taken together, was the failure
to make compensation therefor to the Indian assignees
when the railroad was constructed or until after the lands
had been sold for their benefit to the remote grantor of
the appellants. The railroad was in existence and being
operated across the land at the time of the sale, as ever
since, and therefore there can be no claim that that or
any subsequent purchase was made without notice of the
right of way.
So, if the appellants be regarded as claiming under the
Indian assignees, which is the most favorable view for the
appellants, the case still falls within the general rule, that
where a railroad company enters upon the land of another

and constructs a railroad thereover under a statute entitling it so to do on condition that compensation be made
to the owner, and the latter permits the road to be constructed and put into operation without a compliance
with that condition, a subsequent vendee of the owner
takes the land subject to the burden of the right of way,
and the right to exact payment therefor from the railroad
company belongs to the owner at the time the company
entered and constructed the road. Roberts v. Northern
Pacific Railroad Co., 158 U. S. 1, and cases cited.
At an early stage of the case it appears to have been contended that the appellants acquired title to parts of the
right of way by adverse possession, but as the contention
is expressly abandoned in the brief, evidently in view of
the ruling in Northern Pacikc Railroad Co. v. Smith, 171
U. S. 260; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Townsend, 190
U. S. 267, and Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Ely, 197
U. S. 1, it need not be considered..We conclude that the decree of the Circuit Court of
Appeals was right.
Decree affirmed.

FLANNELLY v. DELAWARE AND HUDSON CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 132.

Argued December 19, 20, 1911.-Decided June 10, 1912.

The law requires of one going upon or over a railroad crossing the
exercise of such care for his own protection as a reasonably prudent
,person ordinarily would take in the same or like circumstances, including the use of his faculties of sight and hearing.
Whether such care has been exercised is generally a quest'on of fact
for the jury, especially if the evidence be conflicting or such that
different inferences may reasonably be drawn from it.
