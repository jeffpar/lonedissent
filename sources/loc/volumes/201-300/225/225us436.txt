Syllabus.

225 U. S.

We express no opinion whether to cut this telephone
company down to six per cent. by legislation would or
would not be confiscatory. But when it is remembered
what clear evidence the court requires before it declares
legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when
it is considered how speculative every figure is that we
have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion
that the result is too near the dividing line not to make
actual experiment necessary. The Master thought that
the probable net income for the year that would suffer
the greatest decrease would be 8.60 per cent. on the values
estimated by him. The Judge on assumptions to which
we have stated our disagreement makes the present earnings 51°/17 per cent. with a reduction by the ordinance to
3'/17 per cent. The whole question is too much in the air
for us to feel authorized to let the irijunction stand.
Decree reversed without prejudice.

MESSENGER v. ANDERSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT. OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 150.

Argued January 19, 22, 1912.-Decided June 2, 1912.

Where the Circuit Court of Appeals has before it in the second trial
of the same case, a will previously construed by it, and meanwhile
the highest court of the State in which the real estate affected is
situated has construed the will differently,'the Circuit Court of Appeals is not bound to adhere to its previous decision as being the law
of the case. It may follow, and in such a case it should lean toward
an agreement with, the state court.
In the absence of statute, the phrase "law of the case," as applied to
the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering
them in the same case, mercly-expresses the practice of courts gen-

erally to refuse to open what ha; been decided-not a limit to their
power.
In a conflict between decisions of the state and Federal courts, this
court is free when the case come:; here.
In this case, in which the Circuit Court of Appeals construed a will as
giving testator's son a life interest only with remainder that he
could not affect, and the state court construed it .as giving him the
estate subject to the divesting clause, held, that the construction
given by the state court was right and that the Circuit Court of Appeals should have followed it.
Qwsre whether the decision of the state court did not finally adjudicate the question of title af between the parties so as to be
binding upon every court before which the title might subsequently
be discussed.
171 Fed. Rep. 785, reversed.

THE facts, which involve the construction of a will affecting real estate in Ohio, and the question of whether
the Federal courts should follow the state court in such
a case, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Harry E. King and Mr. Clayton M. Everett, with
whom Mr. Oliver B. Snider was on the brief, for petitioner:
The first and second judgments of the Circuit Court of

Appeals each reversed the preceding judgment of the
Circuit Court, and remanded the case generally, without
other direction, and therefore, until the last judgment of
the Circuit Court, no final judgment was rendered. Aurora

The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that under
the will respondent took an estate in remainder upon the
decease of his father, is contrary to long settled rule of
property in Ohio. Abbot v. Essex Co., 18 How. 202; Parrish v. Ferris, 6 Ohio St. 563; Niles v. Gray, 12 Ohio

The Federal courts must look to the law of the State
in which land is situated for the rules which govern its
descent, alienation and transfer and for the effect and
construction of wills and other instruments conveying title
thereto, and in trials at law must regard the state law as
a rule of decision. Section 721, U. S. Rev. St.; Brine v.

The construction given the will by the Circuit Court
of Appeals, 146 Fed. Rep. 929,. rests largely upon three
cases, one from Ohio, one from Georgia and the third
from South Carolina, each of which has been discredited or
overruled. The rule in Ohio is not as declared in Shaw v.
Hoard, 18 Ohio St. 228, but the opposite as in Anderson v.
United Realty Co., 79 Ohio St. 23, and cases therein cited.
In Georgia, not as in Wetter v. United &c. Co., 75 Georgia,

The decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is also opposed to the decisions of the highest court of Mississippi,
where the testator resided when his will was drawn, executed and took effect. Jordon v. Roach, 32 Mississippi,

contrary to the, decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio
is also opposed to the decisions of the highest courts of all
the States comprising the Sixth Circuit. Hart v. Thompson, 42 Kentucky, 482; Daniel v. Thompson, 53 Kentucky,

It is the duty of courts to construe wills as they find
them, and not to make them. While the doctrine of implication must be resorted to cautiously in the construction
of wills, the courts should not hesitate to resort to that
doctrine, when thus only can the manifest intention of
the testator be carried out. Holton v. White, 23 N. J. L.

at bar.
It is essential to a complete and effectual delivery of an
instruiment intended to operate as a present deed, that
the grantor should part with all control and dominion
over it. If he retains the right to recall the deed, it cannot be considered as delivered. The same principle applies to an escrow. 1 Devlin on Deeds, § 324, p. 578, citing Campbell v. Thomas, 42 Wisconsin, 437; Miller v.
Sears, 91 California, 282; Prutsman v. Baker, 30 Wisconsin, 644; In re Cornelius' Estate, 151 California, 550. And

brought by the respondent, Anderson. The case went
three times to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and ended
in a judgment for the plaintiff. 146 Fed. Rep. 929; 77 C. C.
A. 179. 158 Fed. Rep. 250; 85 C. C. A. 468. 171 Fed.
Rep. 785; 96 C. C. A. 445. The facts that need to be
stated are these: In 1841 Charles Butler assigned an overdue mortgage of the land to Henry Anderson as security
for a note of his own. He made default, Anderson brought
a bill to foreclose, (Butler not being served with process),
got a decree, bought in, and got the sale confirmed. For
the purposes of this decision it may be assumed that Anderson got the land in fee simple, subject to some question
as to Butler's rights. The plaintiff below, the respondent
here, claimed as remainderman under the will of Henry
Anderson, who was his grandfather. The petitioner claims
under a conveyance from Butler. If the plaintiff's title
is bad that is an end of the case.
In 1846 Henry Anderson, then domiciled in Mississippi,
made his will and died, leaving two sons William and
James. These sons executed deeds declaring that their
father Henry held and intended to hold the land intrust
to secure the payment of Butler's note, and Butler subsequently made such payments on the same that itmay
be assumed that unless the plaintiff has a title that his
father James could not affect by the above-mentioned
deed, he has none. Whether he has such a title depends
on the terms of Henry's will. That instrument, after
creating a general trust of substantially all the testator's
property, went on thus: "Item. Itismy will that when my
son William arrives at the age of twenty-one years the
trustees . . . shall deliver to him a settlement of the
affairs of the trust, and ifmy debts are then paid, and as
soon as that takes place, they shall put him inpossession
of one-half of my property reserving thereout two-fifth
parts of said moiety, by valuation which my said trustees
shall hold in trust and properly invest and pay over to

MESSENGER v. ANDERSON.
225 U. S.

Opinion of ihe Court.

him at the age of twenty-five years
And it is
my will that my said trustees hold and invest and pay over
the remaining moiety of my estate to my son James at
the respective periods of twenty-one and twenty-five
years of age being governed as to the amounts to be
paid at each of the respective periods by the same rules
and directions as are above laid down in the bequest to
William," &c..
If these clauses were all, there would be no doubt that
William and James got an absolute title when they reached
the age mentioned. But a following paragraph reads, "If
either of my sons die without lineal descendants the one
surviving shall take his estate above bequeathed, and if
the survivor die without lineal descendants then" over to
brothers and sisters of the testator. Later in the paragraph the testator says: "I make the following explanation: The limitations over on the death of my surviving
son without lineal descendants is intended to take effect if
there be no lineal descendants living at the time of the
decease of such son. Nothing: in the foregoing will shall
be construed as to deprive either of mysons of disposing of
their portions by will on their attaining the age of twentyone years respectively. The above limitations over shall
give way to the provision of such wills." The testator's
son William died in 1850, unmarried and intestate. The
other son James died in 1902, intestate and leaving the
plaintiff his only child.
The Circuit Court of Appeals when this case first came
up held that James took only a life estate and that the
plaintiff got a remainder that his father could not affect.
146 Fed. Rep. 929. But pending the proceedings another
case was tried in the state courts between these same
parties concerning other parcels of land in Toledo depending on the same title, in which it was decided by the
lower court and affirmed on writ of error by the Supreme
Court of Ohio that James took a fee subject to be defeated

only by his leaving no lineal descendant. Anderson v.
United Realty Co., 79 Ohio St. 23. S. C., 222 U. S. 164.
The judgment of the lower court was pleaded, but it
was held by the Circuit Court of Appeals after the affirmance by the Supreme Court that its own previous decision
was the law of the case and that it was not at liberty to
reverse the judgment even if the matter was res judicata
on the principle laid down in New Orleans v. Citizens'
Bank, 167 U. S. 371, 396. See Parrishv. Ferris,2 Black,
606. In the absence of statute the phrase, law of the case,
as applied to -the effect of previous orders on the later
action of the court rendering them in the same case,
merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse
to reopen what has been decided, not a limit to their
power. King v. West Virginia, 216 U. S.92, 100. Remington v. Central Pacific R. R. Co., 198 U. S. 95, 99, 100.
Great Western Telegraph Co. v. Burnham, 162 U. S. 339,
343. Of course this court, at least, is free when the case
comes here. PanamaR. R. R. Co. v. Napier Shipping Co.,
166 U. S.280. United States v. Denver & Rio Grande R. R.
Co., 191 U. S. 84. In our opinion even apart from the
effect of the state judgment as an adjudication it should
have been followed, if for no other reason, because at
least as against the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
it was right.
The later clauses that we ,have quoted from the will
make a difference, it is true, according to whether the sons
leave lineal descendants at their death or not. But the
interest thus exhibited in descendants is satisfied by the
probability that they would inherit the property or be
provided for out of it. It is not shown to be so definite
and paramount as to cut down the gifts imported by the
previous words except in the single event in which the
will does so in terms. On the contrary the still later provision that nothing shall be construed to 'deprive' the
sons of the power to dispose of 'their portions' by will

ZECKENDQRF v. STEINFELD.

Syllabus.

indicates that the testator meant the sons to be owners
of his estate, subject to the divesting clause.
We should lean toward art agreement with the state
courts, especially in a matter like this. In the present
instance we see no sufficient reason for refusing to follow
their judgment, even if, for any cause not pointed out to
us, it did not finally adjudicate the question of title as
between these parties in such wise as to be binding upon
every court before which that title subsequently might
be discussed.
Judgment reversed.

Argued March 15, 1912.-Decided June 7, 1912.

One of the parties interested in and having control of a mining company purchased a neighboring group of mines and agreed that the
company should have the opportunity of taking them on reimbursing him for outlay; if not availed of, he to keep them for his own.
Subsequently the combined groups being sold he claimed the agreement had by reason of certain resolutions been rescinded and that
he was entitled to the proceeds of the purchased group. The case
was twice lefore the Supreme Court of the Territory: on the first
appeal that court held that the agreement had been rescinded. Held
that:
The findings of fact sent up from the territorial court must alone
