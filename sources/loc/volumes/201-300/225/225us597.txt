At an early stage of the case it appears to have been contended that the appellants acquired title to parts of the
right of way by adverse possession, but as the contention
is expressly abandoned in the brief, evidently in view of
the ruling in Northern Pacikc Railroad Co. v. Smith, 171
U. S. 260; Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Townsend, 190

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

THIRD CIRCUIT.

No. 132.

Argued December 19, 20, 1911.-Decided June 10, 1912.

The law requires of one going upon or over a railroad crossing the
exercise of such care for his own protection as a reasonably prudent
,person ordinarily would take in the same or like circumstances, including the use of his faculties of sight and hearing.
Whether such care has been exercised is generally a quest'on of fact
for the jury, especially if the evidence be conflicting or such that
different inferences may reasonably be drawn from it.

Argument for Petitioners.

225 U. S.

In this case, held that the evidence on the queslion of contributory
negligence of a woman crossing a dangerous railroad crossihg was
properly submitted to the jury, and that there was evidence from
which the jury could well have found, as they did, that she was not
negligent.

of a railroad company and degree of care required by one

petitioners:
No question of law was before the Circuit Court of

Bedford, 3 Pet. 443-448; Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,174 U. S. 1-3.
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of

the court.
This was an action to recover damages for injuries and
loss occasioned, as was alleged, by negligence of a railroad
company resulting in the collision of one of its trains
with a vehicle passing over a grade crossing in Pennsylvania. The negligence charged against the defendant
was the failure to give due and timely warning of the
approach of the train, and the defense interposed was the
freedom of the defendant from the negligence charged,
and the failure of one of the plaintiffs, who was driving
the Vehicle, to take reasonable precautions, before attempting to drive over the crossing, to ascertain whether she
could do so in safety. In the Circuit Court there was
a verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs, and the defendant took the case on a writ of error to the Circuit Court
of Appeals. That court treated the record as presenting,
in substance, two questions: First, whether there was
any substantial evidence of actionable negligence on the
part of the defendant, and, second, whether the evidence
conclusively established the defense of contributory

negligence. Upon examining the evidence purporting
to be set out in the record, the Circuit Court of Appeals
answered the first question, favorably to the plaintiffs
and the second favorably to the defendant, and accordingly
reversed the judgment. 172 Fed. Rep. 328. The case
was then brought here on a writ of certiorari granted on
the petition of the plaintiffs.

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court,

225 U. S.

Assuming, but without so deciding, that the state of
the record was such as to justify the Circuit Court of
Appeals in examining the evidence and determining
whether it conclusively established the defense of contributory negligence, we come ,to consider whether that question was rightly decided.
As is often true in such cases, some matters were not
disputed at the trial, while others were the subjects of
conflicting testimony or of testimony from which different
inferences reasonably could be drawn. The matters
not disputed were these: The injury occurred in the
daytime, at a grade crossing in a small country village.
The defendant's tracks, which were three in number,
ran in a northerly and southerly direction and crossed
the highway at right angles. About 700 feet south of
the crossing the tracks curved to the west, and when cars
were occupying the east track south of the crossing a
traveler on the highway east of the crossing could not
see a train approaching from the south on either of the
other tracks. Mrs. Flannelly, one of the plaintiffs and
wife of the other, had occasion to drive along the highway
from her home, a few miles east of the railroad, to a point
on the other side of it. Seated in the vehicle with her
were two small boys. As she neared the crossing a freight
train was approaching on the east track from the north.
She stopped about 40 feet from that track and waited for
the train to pass, which took some time, as it was long
and moving slowly. Before this train obscured the view
she looked along the tracks to the south and observed
that no train was in sight coming from that direction.
After the rear of the freight train passed about 150 feet
beyond the crossing she drove to the first track, or near
it, and, on looking in both directions and seeing no train
approaching, started to drive over the tracks. Her view
at that time extended 300 feet or more to the south
along the second track. As she was passing over that

FLANNELLY v. DELAWARE & HUDSON CO. 603
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

track a passenger train approaching thereon from the
south sounded a sharp danger signal, and soon struck
a rear wheel of her vehicle, thereby wrecking the latter,
inflicting bodily injuries on her, and killing one of the
boys. The train was moving at a rate of from 50 to 60
miles an hour, or from 73 to 88 feet per second. There
was also testimony, more or less disputed, from which

the jury reasonably could have found that no whistle
was sounded by the passenger train at the place where
such a warning of its approach was usually and properly
given; that the freight train came to a stop before Mrs.
Flannelly drove on the tracks; that she listened attentively for signals given by approaching trains, but heard
none, other than the danger signal which came too late
to be of avail; that her horse became restive and nervous
before she advanced to the crossing; that when the danger
signal was sounded by the passenger train the horse
halted, reared and delayed their progress between five
and ten seconds; and that as that signal was sounded
she saw 'the passenger train emerge from a volume of
smoke or steam which was hanging over the tracks to the
south.
The law requires of one going upon or over a',railroad
crossing the exercise of such care for his own protection
as a reasonably prudent person ordinarily would take in
the same or like circumstances, including the use of his
faculties of sight and hearing. And, generally speaking,
whether such care has been exercised is aquestion of fact
for the jury, especially if the evidence be conflicting or
such that different inferences reasonably may be drawn
from it.
We think the evidence in this case, when tested by these.
standards, required that the defense of contributory
negligence be submitted to the jury as a question of fact,
as was done by the Ci1-cuit Court. The conclusion to the
contrary in the Circuit Court of Appeals was rested upon

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.

225 U. S.

the theory that the freight train did not stop after clearing the crossing but continuedr in a southerly direction,
thereby giving promise that the obstruction to the view
along the tracks on that side of the crossing would quickly
disappear. But a careful examination of the record
satisfies us that there was evidence from which the jury
could well have found that the train came to a full stop
about 150 feet south of the crossing before Mrs. Flannelly
started to cross over. If it did, she hardly could be
declared negligent for failing to await its further movements, of which she knew nothing. Besides, if the action
of her horse was as described, she ought not to be charged
with negligence in not anticipating it.
Other questions were discussed at bar and in the briefs,
but as, in the view which we take of the evidence examined
by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the judgment of the
Circuit Court should have been affirmed, the other questions need not be considered.
Judgment reversed.
