SHULTHIS v,McDOUGAL.
BERRYHILL v. SHULTHIS.
APPEALS FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.
Nos. 156, 157.

Argued January 23, 24, 1912.-Decided June 7, 1912.

Where a petition of intervention is entertained and disposed of in
virtue of jurisdiction already invoked, if the decree of the Circuit
Court of Appeals is final in respect of the original suit, it is equally
so in respect of the intervention.
Whether jurisdiction depends alone on diverse citizenship or on other
grounds as well, must be determined from complainant's own statement in the bill of his cause of action, regardless of what may be
brought into the suit by answer or in subsequent proceedings.
Jurisdiction of the Federal court can only rest on grounds distinctly
and affirmatively set forth; grounds of jurisdiction, other than those
of diverse citizenship alleged, cannot be inferred argumentatively
from statements in the bill.
A case is not one arising under the laws of the United States unless it
.really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting
the validity, construction or effect of such a law upon the determination whereof the result depend,,. This rule applies peculiarly to
suits respecting rights to land acquired under laws of the United
States; otherwise all suits to establish title to land which had been
part of the public domain would be cognizable in the Federal courts.
The fact that the controversy might have arisen under the laws of
the United States does not give the Federal court jurisdiction, if the
bill does not allege the facts in that particular, and the controversy
might have arisen in another way independent of those laws.

statutes of Arkansas were, under authority of Congress, in force in
that Territory is not for that reasoa a Federal corporation, but is to
be regarded for jurisdictional purposes as one of Oklahoma. Kansas

been adopted by a Territorial legislature.
In this case held, that as the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court dependd
solely upon diverse citizenship, the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals was final; and, notwithstanding the case involved conflicting claims to allotted lands in the Creek Nation, it was not one
arising under the laws of the United States.
Appeals from 170 Fed. Rep. 529, dismissed.

THE facts, which involve the determination of the
question of finality of judgments of the Circuit Court
of Appeals under the act of 1891, in a suit brought to
determine conflicting. rights to a tract of land in the
Creek Nation, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. C. L. Thomas, with whom Mr. Edgar A. de Meules

was on the brief for appellant in No. 156, and appellee
in No. 157:
This court has jurisdiction.
The effect of the patent issued to the lessor of appellant,
by the United States and the Creek Nation, requires an
interpretation of ยง7 of the act of June 30, 1902, 32 St.
L. 500, and necessarily presents a Federal question.

The defendant, Kiefer Oil & Gas Company, being, as
alleged in the bill, "a corporation duly organized
under and by virtue of the laws of the United States in
force in the Indian Territory," this suit is one arising
under the laws of the United States, and, therefore, the
jurisdiction of this court exists in this case. Osborn v.

As it appears from the bill that the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was not dependent entirely upon
diverse citizenship, the judgment of the Circuit Court
of Appeals was not final, and the right of appeal to this
.court exists. Nor. Pac. Ry. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U. S.

depended solely upon the diversity of citizenship must be
determined from an examination of the plaintiff's bill to
the exclusion of all other parts of the record. Colorado

Court by the defendants setting up a Federal question,
or making a claim to the title under some Federal law.

Where jurisdiction is claimed on the ground that there
is a Federal question involved, it is not sufficient that
jurisdiction may be inferred argumentatively under averments, and the allegations showing the Federal question
must be positive, and the Federal question must clearly
'appear. Handford v. Davies, 163 U. S. 274; Iowa v.

Plaintiff's allegation that he bases title to the oil and
gas in the land, and the right to operate the same and
have the defendants enjoined from operating for oil and
gas, is not sufficient to show a Federal question, although
the plaintiff alleges that his rights exist under an oil and
gas lease executed by a Creek Indian and approved by
the Secretary of the Interior, as required by act of Con-

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
These are appeals from decrees of the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirming a decree of
the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma
dismissing on the merits a bill in equity, as also a petition in intervention, brought to determine conflicting
claims to a tract of allotted land in the Creek Nation.
The allegations of the bill may be summarized as follows:
The complainant, Shulthis:. is a citizen of Kansas. One
of the defendants, the Kiefer Oil and Gas Company,
the Indian Territory under
is a corporation organized in'
the Arkansas statutes which were put in force therein
by an act of Congress, and since the admission of Oklahoma as a State "has been and now is a citizen and
resident of said State" and of the Eastern District
thereof. The other defendants are citizens of that State,
resident in that district. The intervenor, George Franklin
Berryhill, is a member by blood of the Creek Nation,
duly enrolled as such, and his wife is not a member.
A son, named Andrew J. Berryhill, was born to the

Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

intervenor and his wife in May, 1901, and died in November following, leaving no brother or sister surviving.
In October, 1902, the deceased son's name was placed on
the roll of the Creek Nation by the Commission to the
Five Civilized Tribes, and thereafter an. allotment, including the tract in controversy, was made to his "heirs"
from the lands of the Nation, and a deed or patent was
issued to such heirs with the approval of the Secretary
of the Interior. Subsequently, and in March, 1906,
George Franklin Berryhill and his wife, claiming to be
the sole heirs of Andrew J. and the owners in fee of this
tract, executed to the complainant a lease thereof, granting to him the right to explore for and extract oil and gas
from the land for the term of fifteen years. The lease was
made conformably to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, was filed with the United States
Indian Agent at Muskogee, in the Indian Territory,
March 21, 1906, and was approved by the Secretary of
the Interior April 19, 1907. The complainant complied
with the regulations, duly paid the advance royalty provided for in the lease, and claims the sole and 'exclusive
right to prospect for and extract the deposits of oil and
gas existing in and under the land, which are said to be
extensive and to have a value many times in excess of
$2,000. Respecting the claims and acts of the defendants
the bill alleges:
"Your orator further shows that the defendants and
each of them claim and assert some right, title and interests in and to said lands anl particularly to the said
oil and natural gas deposits adverse to your orator, but
the nature of said claims of said defendants is to your
orator unknown; but your orator states that they have
no such right, title or interest in the said deposits of
oil and natural gas or any part thereof; that whatever
claimed rights the said defendants or any of them have
therein, were acquired long subsequent to the right of

SHULTHIS v, McDOUGAL.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

your orator hereinbefore set forth; and further were acquired with notice and knowledge of the lease to your
orator so executed, filed and approved as aforesaid; and
also of facts and circumstances sufficient to put them
and each of them upon inquiry with reference thereto.
"Your orator further states that the said defendant
Kiefer Oil and Gas Company, combining and confederating with the other defendants named herein, have disregarded and still disregard the rights of your orator, and
in violation thereof, and without right, unlawfully .and
wilfully on or about the first day of April, 1907, entered
upon the said above described lands, and have stationed
thereon divers agents, servants and employ6s; whose
names are to your orator unknown, and with force and
arms exclude and have excluded your orator and his
agents, servants and .employ6s therefrom; and further
that. said defendants have bored and drilled oil and gas
wells on said premises, and have, and still are allowing
large quantities of oil and natural gas to escape therefrom
and be wasted. That by reason thereof your orator has
been damaged in the sum of $25,000. And further, said
defendants threaten to, and will unless restrained by this
court, drill other and further wells on said land for oil and
natural gas, and have and are threatening to, and will
unless restrained, by means of such wells, extract said oil
and gas deposits from said land and convert the same to
their own use and benefit against the manifest right .of
your orator."
The prayer of the bill is that the defendants be decreed
to have no interest or estate in the deposits of oil and gas,
save as any defendant may have an 'interest in the land
and be thereby entitled to the royalties secured by the
lease; that the cloud cast upon the complainant's title and
rights under the lease by the claims of the defendants be
removed and his title and rights thereunder be quieted,
and that a receiver be appointed to take possession and

568

Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

proceed with the extraction and disposal of the oil and
gas for the benefit of whomsoever may prove to be entitled
to it. After the filing of the bill, A receiver was appointed,
who took ppssession and proceeded as suggested. Thereafter George Franklin Berryhill, who had not been made
a party to the bill, was permitted to file in the suit a petition in intervention, wherein he asserted full title in himself to the land, subject only to the lease to the complainant, specifically set forth the claims of the defendants,
assailed those claims as invalid and clouds upon his title,
and sought a decree establishing the latter as against the
former. Answers and replications were filed, proofs were
taken, and on the final hearing a decree was entered for
the defendants. 162 Fed. Rep. 331. The complainant
and the intervenor separately appealed to the Circuit
Court of Appeals, where the decree was affirmed, 170 Fed.
Rep. 529, and then the case was brought here.
Our jurisdiction is challenged by a motion to dismiss
the appeals. Section 6 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26
Stat. 826, c. 517, declares that "the judgments or decrees
of the circuit courts of appeals shall be final in all cases in
which the jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the opposite parties to the suit or controversy being .
citizens of different States," and this refers to the jurisdiction of the Federal court of first instance. Thus, it becomes necessary to consider whether the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court depended entirely upon diversity of
citizenship. If it did, the appeals must be dismissed.
The question is not affected by the petition in intervention, for it was entertained and disposed of in virtue of
the jurisdiction already invoked; and if the decree is final
in respect of the original suit, it is equally so in respect of
the intervention. Rouse v. Letcher, 156 U. S. 47; Gregory
v. Van Ee, 160 U. S.643; Pope v. Louisville &c. Co., 173
U. S.573; St, Louis, K. C. & C. R. R. Co. v. Wabash Railroad Co., 217 U. S.247, 250.

SHULTHIS v. McDOUGAL.
225 U. S.

569

Opinion of the Court.

In opposing the motion the appellants contend that the
case, arose under certain laws of the United States, presently to be mentioned, and therefore was not one in which
the jurisdiction depended entirely on diversity of citizenship. The consideration of the contention will be simplified
if, before taking up the specific grounds on which it is
advanced, the rules by which ib must be tested are stated.
They are:
1' Whether the jurisdiction depended on diverse citizenship alone, or on other grounds as well, must be determined from the complainant's statement of his own cause
of action as set forth in the bill, regardless of questions
that may have been brought into the suit by the answers
or in the course of the subsequent proceedings. Colorado
Central Mining Co. v. Turck, 150 U. S. 138; Tennessee v.
Union and Planters'Bank, 152 U. S. 454; Spencer v. Duplan
Silk Co., 191 U. S. 526; Devine v. Los Angeles, 202 U., S.
313, 333..
2. It is not enough that grounds of jurisdiction other
than diverse citizenship may be inferred. argumentatively
from the statements in the bill, for jurisdiction cannot
rest on any ground that is not affirmatively and distinctly
set forth. Hanford v. Davies, 163 U. S. 273, 279; Mountain View Mining Co. v. McFadden, 180.U. S. 533; Bankers,
Casualty Co. v. Minneapolis &c. Co., 192 U. .S. 371, 383,
385.
3. A suit to enforce a right which takes its origin in the
laws of the United States is not necessarily, or for that
reason alone, one arising under those laws, for a suit does
not so arise unless it really and substantially involves a
dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of such a law, upon the determination of
which the result depends. This is especially so of a suit
involving rights to land acquired under a law of the
United States. If it were not, every suit to establish title
to land in the central and western States would so arise,

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

as all titles in those States are traceable back to those
laws Little York Gold-Washing and Water Co. v. Keyes,
96 U. S. 199; Colorado Centrdl Mining Co. v. Turck, supra;
Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S. 571;
Florida Central & P. Railroad Co. v. Bell, 176 U. S. 321;
Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S. 505; De Lamar's
Nevada Co. v. Nesbitt, Id. 523.
To sustain the contention that the, suit was one arising
under the laws of the United States, counsel for the appellants point out the statutes (Acts March 1, 1901, 31
Stat. 861, c. 676; June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500, c. 1323;
April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, c. 1876, ยง 22) relating to the
allotment in severalty of the lands of the Creek Nation,
the leasing and alienation thereof after allotment, the
making of allotments to the heirs of deceased children,
and the rights of the heirs, collectively and severally,
under such allotments; but the bill makes no mention of
those statutes or of any controversy respecting their
validity, construction or effect. Neither does it by necessary implication point to such a controversy. True, it
contains enough to indicate that those statutes constitute
the source of the complainant's title or right, and also

shows that the defendants are in some way claiming the
land, and particularly the oil and gas, adversely to him;
but beyond this the nature of the controversy is left un-

stated and uncertain. Of course, 'it could have arisen in
different ways wholly indepeident of the source from
which his title or right was derived. So, looking only to

the bill, as we have seen that we must, it cannot be held
that the case as therein stated was one arising under the
statutes mentioned. As was said in Blackburn v. Portland
Gold Mining Co., supra, a controversy in respect of lands
has never been regarded as presenting a Federal question
merely because one of the parties to it has derived his
title under an act of Congress.
It next is insisted that the bill shows that the Kiefer Oil

Opinion of the Court.

and Gas Company, one of the defendants, is a Federal
corporation, and therefore that under the decisions of this
court in Osborn v. Bank, 9 'Wheat. 738; Pacific Railroad
Removal Cases, 115 U. S. 1, and Matter of Dunn, 212 U. S.
374, the case was one arising under the laws of the United
States. The bill states that this company was incorporated in the Indian Territory under the Arkansas statutes, which were put in force therein by an act of Congress,
and then adds that since the admission of Oklahoma as a
State the company "has been and now is a citizen and
resident of said State." Evidently, the pleader did not
anticipate the present insistence, but proceeded on the
theory that the company became an Oklahoma corporation when that State was admitted into the Union.
The corporation laws of Arkansas were put in force in
the Indian Territory by the act of February 18, 1901, 31
Stat. 794, c. 379, which was but one of a series of acts of
that character. Congress was then contemplating the
early inclusion of that Territory in a new State, and the
purpose of those acts was to provide, for the time being,
a body of laws adapted to the needs of the locality and
its people in respect of matters of local or domestic concern. There being no local legislature, Congress alone
could act. Plainly, its action was intended to be merely
provisional and not to encroach upon the powers which
rightfully would belong to the prospective State. The
situation, therefore, is practically the same as it would
be had the corporation laws of Arkansas been adopted and
put in force by a local or territorial legislature. United
States v. Pridgeon, 153 U. S. 48, 52-54.
In Kansas Pacific Railroad Co. v. Atchison, Topeka &
Santa Fe Railroad Co., 112 U. S. 414, this court had occasion to consider the effect of the admission of a Territory
.as a State on corporations existing at the-timeunder the
territorial laws, and it was there said (p. 415):
"The admission of Kansas as a State into the'Union,

-25 U. S.

and the consequent change of its form of government, in
no respect affected the essential character of the corporations or their powers or rights. They must after that
change be considered as corporations of the State, as
much so as if they had derived their existence from its
legislation. As its corporations they are to be treated, so
far as may be necessary to enforce contracts or rights of
property by or against them, as citizens within the clause
of the Constitution declaring the extent of the judicial
power of the United States."
Adhering to the principle of that ruling, we hold that
the corporate defendant here is an Oklahoma, and not a
Federal, corporation, and therefore must be regarded as a
citizen of that State for jurisdictional purposes.
It follows from what has been said that the case is one
in which the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court depended
entirely on diverse citizenship, and so the decrees of the
Circuit Court of Appeals are final.
