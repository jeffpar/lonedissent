JORDAN v. MASSACHUSETTS.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

JORDAN v. COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.
ERROR TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE COMMONWEALTH
OF MASSACE[USETTS.
No. 519.

Argued April 16, 1912.-Decided May 27, 1912.

Subject to the requirement of due process of law, the States are under
no restriction as to their methods of procedure in the administration of public justice. Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 111.
Due process of law implies a tribunal both impartial and mentally
competent to afford a hearing; but due process is not denied when a
competent state court refuses to set aside a verdict because the
sanity of one of the jurors which has been questioned is established,
after an inquiry in accordance with the established procedure of the
State, only by a preponderance of evidence.
In this case held, that one convicted by a jury and sentenced to death
was not denied due process of law because after the verdict one of
the jurors became insane and the court, after an inquiry had-in accordance with the established procedure of the State, found by a
preponderance of evidence that the juror was of sufficient mental
capacity during the trial to act as such and therefore refused to set
the verdict aside.
The practice of the Massachusetts courts in this case was not inconsistent with the rules of the common law in regard to determining
the mental capacity of jurors.
207 Massachusetts, 259, affirmed.

THE facts, which involve the question of whether one
convicted in a state court by a jury, a member of which
was possibly insane at the time, was denied due process
of law, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Harvey H. Pratt and Mr. Arthur Thad Smith, with
whom Mr. Charles W. Bartlett and Mr. Jeremiah S. Sulli-van were on the brief, for plaintiff in error:

prived defendant of one of those fundamental rights, the
observance of which is indispensable to the liberty of the
citizen.
A defendant cannot be deprived of any of his fundamental rights by a form of procedure. There is a limit
beyond which state courts cannot go. Fayerweather v.
Ritch, 195 U. S. 276; Chicago, B. &c. R. R. v. Chicago, 166
U. S. 226; Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175.
Due process of law requires an unquestionably competent tribunal before whom a citizen is tried; a tribunal unquestionably incompetent to render judgment upon him
because it contains among its members a person who was
unqualified mentally to render a verdict does not constitute due process. Chicago, B. &c. R. R. v. Chicago, supra.
Any matter relating to the character of the tribunal
before which a person is to be tried is one of substance
and not one of form. Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343.
The refusal of the trial court to set aside the verdict
and sentence of death based upon the verdict of a jury,
one of the members of which was incompetent mentally,
deprived defendant of one of his fundamental rights.
There is the clearest line of demarcation between the
mental disqualification of a juror and the disqualifications
and irregularities that have been declared by this court to
be within the power of the States to pass upon, and with
which this court will not interfere. Kohl v. Lehlback, 160
U. S. 293; Wassum v. Feeney, 121 Massachusetts, 93;
Commonwealth v. Wong Chung, 186 Massachusetts, 231,
do not apply.
In Massachusetts there are certain grounds for a new
trial that require a new trial to be granted as matter of
law and which if they exist do not permit the court to
refuse a new trial as a matter of discretion. Read v.
Cambridge, 124 Massachusetts, 567; Sargent v. Roberts,

Nary, 10 Allen, 16.

Argument for Pla'intiff in Error.

Under the Fourteenth Amendment the duty of seeing
to it in the first instance thatb due process of law is observed in the trial of the citizen, devolves, necessarily, on
the State. The conduct of the courts and the procedure
therein is placed exclusively in the power of the State and
to the State is entrusted the duty of seeing to it that the
constitutional rights of citizens are retained for them.
Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S.138, 140; Chicago &c. R. R. v.
Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 234, 235; Thompson v. Utah, 170

West Virginia v. Cartwright, 20 W. Va. 32, 45; State v.
Prescott, 7 N. H. 287, 292.
Upon the voir dire, if the prisoner challenges a juror,
even for a disability extrinsic -of his mental qualifications,
all that is necessary for him to do is to introduce evidence
that is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the mind
of the court; and it is then the duty of the Government
to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the juror is a
proper one. Hol v. People, 13 Michigan, 224, 226, 227.
If it appears that a situation exists in which there is any
possibility that the jurors were not mentally in condition
to perform their duties, the verdict must as a matter of law
be set aside. Commonwealth v. Roby, 12 Pick. '496, 512,

Due process of law is not observed if a defendant in a
capital case be tried before a less than the constitutional
number of jurors, even though the defendant himself consent to such procedure. Hill v. People, 16 Michigan, 351,
358; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 349.
The duty to furnish a constitutional tribunal and to see
that due process of law within the meaning of the Constitution is followed throughout the whole proceeding,
rests solely upon the State; and where the jury ceases to
be a constitutional tribunal, at the suggestion of the
prisoner or anyone else, even though the State has at the
outset furnished a competent and constitutional tribunal,
it is the duty of the State, of its own motion, whether the
defendant acquiesce affirmatively or does nothing to stop
the proceeding, to undo what has been done. See Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 143; Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574,
590; Cancemi v. People, 18 N. Y. 128; Dickinson v. United
States, 159 Fed. Rep. 801; Hill v. People, 16 Michigan, 351.
Mr. James M. Swift, Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, with whom Mr. Walter A.
Powers, Assistant Attorney General, was on the brief, for
defendant in error:
The state court cannot be charged with error in its
findings of fact, King v. West Virginia, 216 U. S., 92, 100;
nor in its interpretation of the Massachusetts law of procedure in criminal trials, Tvining v. New Jersey, 211
U. S. 78,91; but the contention thatwhen in a capital case
the question. of a juror's sanity is, raised aftdr verdict,
unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt
that the juror was sane, the due process clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment requires that the accused be
granted a new trial, is .not valid.
The words "due process of law" do not prescribe
particular rules or forms of procedure for state trials,
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, nor afford a trial by

jury, Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581; Hallinger y. Davis,
146 U. S. 314; Howard v. Kentucky, 200 U. S. 164. See
also Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22, 31; Louisville &
Nashville R. R. Co. v. Schmidt. 177 U. S. 230, 236.
Due process of law requires only that the conduct of the
case be in accordance with the regular procedure of the
State, and that such rirocedure shall not deprive the
accused of a fundamental right. Walker v. Sauvinet, 92
U. S. 90, 93; Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138, 140; Howard
v. Kentucky, 200 U. S. 164, 173.
Conformance to the Massachusetts law of procedure
does not afford an accused a right to have a new trial
unless the juror's sanity is proved beyond .a reasonable
doubt. This pronouncement of the law of Massachusetts
by its"Supreme Judicial Court is conclusive. Twining V.
New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 90; Howard v. Kentucky, supra;
Leeper v. Texas, 139 U. S. 462, 467.
By this settled course of procedure the plaintiff in
error has not been deprived of one of those fundamental
rights, the observance of which is indispensable to the
liberty of the citizen, for, that an accused should be
granted a new trial unless the juror's sanity is proved
beyond a reasonable doubt, is not a fundamental right.
Allen Y. Georgia, supra; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S.
78, 110.
A State may regulate the number of challenges in
criminal cases, Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 68; may prescribe the qualifications of jurymen in criminal cases,
In re Jugiro, 140 U. S. 291; and the number of jurors in
criminal cases, Maxwell v. Dow, supra; and if it is within
the power of the State to say both the number and qualifications of jurors in a criminal case, it may well prescribe that eleven jurors and one who qualifies by a fair
preponderance of the evidence as to his sanity shall constitute the trial jury. Hayes v. Missouri, supra.
In the Federal courts, the denial of a new trial is not

assignable error. Pickett v. United States, 216 U. S. 456;
Bucklin v. United States, 159 U. S. 682.
There is no rule of the common law which prescribes
that in a capital case, unless it be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the juror was sane, a new trial shall be
granted. In England at common law a person convicted
of a capital felony had no right to a new trial. 4 Blackstone's Com. 375, 376. This rule continued in force as
to capital felonies until after the Revolution in America.
See Rex v. Mawbey, 6 Term. R. 638; Commonwealth v.
Green, 17 Massachusetts, 515, 533.
In Massachusetts, although the rule was changed and
it was decided in 1822, in Commonwealth v. Green, supra,
that a new trial could be granted in capital cases, yet
there was no intimation as to what species of irregularity
would operate as a ground for a new trial. See Commonwealth v. Roby, 18 Pick. 496.
The common-law rule in America, as evidenced by the
decisions of the other States where this question has
arisen, does not afford a new trial as claimed by the
plaintiff in error. State v. Howard, 118 Missouri, 127;
State v. Scott, 1 Hawks (8 N. Car.), 24; Surles v. State, 89
Georgia, 167; Wall v. State, 126 Georgia, 549;'Burik v.
Dundee Woolen Co., 66 N. J. L. 420. Hogshead v. State,
6 Humph. 59, distinguished.
It appears that the rule of procedure in force in Massachusetts conforms to the settled usage of the common
law, and this has always been held to fulfill the constitutional requirement of "due process." Hurtado v. California, supra; Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land Co., 18
How. 272, 280.
MR. JUSTICE LURTON

delivered the opinion of the court.

The plaintiff in error was convicted of the crime of
murder in the first degree and sentenced to death, and the
judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court

JORDAN v. MASSACHUSETTS.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The case is
brought here upon a single question, namely, that the
plaintiff in error has been denied due process of law under
the Fourteenth Amendment, because he was tried by a
jury which included one Willis A. White, concerning
whose sanity it is said there existed reasonable doubt.
The jury had been selected .n the usual way, and White
had, been accepted without knowledge by the State or the
defendant of any question concerning his mental fitness.
It was impanelled on April 20, 1909. On May 4 it was
charged, and on the same day returned a verdict. On
May 10, a motion for a new trial was made, based upon
the suggestion by counsel for the prisoner that the juror
White, during the hearing and at the time the verdict was
agreed upon, was insane and incompetent to participate
as a juror. The motion wa:; heard by tN{o of the trial
Justices of the Superior Court, and much oral evidence
bearing upon the sanity of the juror was introduced, all
of which has been preserved by a bill of exceptions. At
the conclusion of the evidence the prisoner presented no
less than seventy-two requests for rulings and findings,
made part of the record. The court found and ruled as
follows (207 Massachusetts, 274):
"We find by a fair preponderance of all the evidence as
a fact that the juror Willis A. White was of sufficient
mental capacity during the entire trial of Chester S. Jordan
until after the verdict was returned, to intelligently consider the evidence, appreciate the arguments of counsel,
the rulings of law, the charge of the court, and to arrive at
a rational conclusion, and therefore we deny the motion.
"Having found the above fact, we deem it unnecessary
to consider the requests for rulings."
The numerous requests for rulings and special findings
all relate to the burden of proof and the rules for the
weighing of evidence upon the issues presented.
The Supreme Judicial Court, after a consideration of

OCTOBER TERM, 19i1.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S.

the evidence upon which this finding was based, ruled
that it could not be said that there was not evidence
warranting the conclusion of the trial'judge.
We shall assume that both the trial court and the
Supreme Judicial Court have sustained the verdict of the
jury because they were of opinion that it was not essential
that the sanity of the juror under the circumstances of
this case should be established by more than a fair preponderance of the evidence. The insistence is that thereby
the constitutional guarantee of due process of law found
in the Fourteenth Amendment has been violated.
That the procedure in this case was in conformity with
the constitution and law of Massachusetts is determined
by the judgment and opinion of the Supreme Judicial
Court.
Subject to the requirement of due process of law, the
States are under no restriction as to their method of procedure in the administration of public justice. That the
court had jurisdiction and that there was a full hearing
upon the issue made by the suggestion of the insanity of
the juror is not questioned. "Subject to these two fundamental conditions, which seem to be universally prescribed
in all systems of law, this court has up to this time sustained all state laws, statutory or judicially declared, regulating procedure, evidence and methods of trial, and held
them to be consistent with due process of law." Twining
v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 111.
In Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138, 140, it is said:
"Without attempting to define exactly in what due
process of law consists, it is sufficient to say that, if the
Supreme Court of a State has acted in consonance with
the constitutional laws of a State and its own procedure,
it could only be in very exceptional circumstances that
this court would feel justified in saying that there had
been a failure of due legal process. We might ourselves
have pursued a different course in this case, but that is not

JORDAN v. MASSACHUSETTS.

Opinion of the Court.

the test. The plaintiff in error must have been deprived
of one of those fundamentaL rights, the observance of
which is indispensable to the liberty of the citizen, to
justify our interference."
In Felts v. Murphy, 201 U. S. 123, it appeared that a
deaf person was tried and convicted of murder. It was
claimed that he had-been denied due process of law because he had not heard a word of the evidence, and that
the evidence should have been repeated to him through
an ear trumpet, although it was not clear that he could
have been made to understand by that means. After
saying that the.state court had jurisdiction of the person
and of the subject-matter, this court said (p. 129):
"The appellant was not deprived of his liberty without
due process of law by the manner in which he was tried,
so as to violate the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. That amendment, it
has been said by this court, 'did not radically change the
whole theory of the relations of the state and Federal
Governments to each other and of both governments to
the people.' In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436. 448; Brown
v. New Jersey, 175 U. S. 172, 175.
"We are unable to see how jurisdiction was lost in this.
case by the manner of trial. The accused was compos
mentis. No claim to the contrary is made. He knew he
was being tried, on account of the killing of the deceased.
He had counsel and understood the fact that he was on
trial on the indictment mentioned, but he did not hear the
evidence. He made no objection, asked for nothing, and
permitted his counsel to take his own course. We see no
loss of jurisdiction in all this and no absence of due process
of law. It is to be regretted that the testimony was not
read or repeated to him. But that omission did not affect
the jurisdiction of the court."
•In Louisville & NashvilleR. Co. v. Schmidt, 177 U. S.
230, 236, it was said:

OCTOBER TERM, 1911.
Opinion of the Court.

225 U. S..

"It is no longer open to contention that the due process
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States does not control mere forms of procedure in state courts or regulate practice therein. All its
requirements are complied with, provided in the proceedings which are claimed not to have been due process of
law the person condemned has had sufficient notice and
adequate opportunity has been afforded him to defend.
Iowa -Central Railway v. Iowa, 160 U. S. 389; Wilson v.
North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586."
Due process implies a tribunal both impartial and
mentally competent to afford a hearing. But to say that
due process is denied when a competent state court refuses to set aside the verdict of a jury because the sanity
.of one of its members was established by only a preponderance of evidence, would be to enforce an exaction
unknown to the precedents of the past, and an interference with the discretion and power of the State not
justified by the demands of justice, nor recognized by any
definition of due process.
In criminal cases due process of law is not denied by a
state law which dispenses with a grand jury indictment
(and permits prosecution upon information, nor by a law
cwhich dispenses with thenecessity of a jury of twelve, or
unanimity in the verdict. Indeed the requirement of due
process does not deprive a State of the power to dispense
with jury trial altogether. Hurtado v. California, 110
U. S. 516; Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581. When the
essential elements of a court having jurisdiction in which
an opportunity for a hearing is afforded are present, the
power of a State over its methods of piocedure is substantially unrestricted by the due process clause of the
Constitution.
Touching the power of the States over their procedure
for the administration of their police power, Mr. Justice
Moody, in Twining v. New Jersey, cited above, said (p. 114):

JORDAN v. MASSACHUSETTS.
225 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

"The power of their people ought not to be fettered,
their sense of responsibility lessened, and their capacity
for sober and restrained self-government weakened by
forced construction of the Federal Constitution. If the
people of New Jersey are not content with the law as declared in repeated decisions of their courts, the remedy is
in their own hands."
The proceeding here in question was in absolute conformity to the Massachusetts law of criminalprocedure,
and no fundamental principle of justice was violated by a
determination of the mental capacity of the juror by a
preponderance of the evidence. Neither is there any
established rule of the common law inconsistent with the
practice adopted in this case. There are many decisions
in accord with the Massachusetts view of the law, among
them being: State v. Scott, 1 Hawks. N. C. 24; Burik v.
Dundee Woolen Co., 66 N. J. Law, 420; State v. Howard,
118 Missouri, 127; Surles v. State, 89 Georgia, 167.
In Hogshead v. State, 6 Humphrey (Tenn.), 59, the
Supreme Court of Tennessee held that the trial court
erred in not granting a new txial when it appeared "probable" that a juror was insane. But in Tennessee the
denial of a new trial is assignable as error and reversible
upon writ of error.
, Our conclusion is that the plaintiff in error has not been
denied due process of law, and the judgment is,
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE PITNEY took no part in the hearing or
consideration of this case.
