Having remitted him to a writ of error as a remedy,
it would be a contradiction of the ruling, he not having
availed himself of the remedy, to permit him to prosecute
habeas corpus. The ground of the decision was that there
was an orderly procedure prescribed by law for him to
pursue, in other words, to set up his defenses of fact and
law, whether they attacked the indictment for insufficiency
or the validity of the law under which it was found, and,
if the decision was against him, test its correctness through
the proper appellate tribunals. It certainly cannot be
said that the District Court of Delaware did not have
jurisdiction of the case, including those defenses, or that
its rulings could not have been reviewed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals or by this court by writ of error. It
would introduce confusion in the administration of
justice if the defenses which might have been made in an
action could be reserved as grounds of attack upon the
judgment after the trial and verdict..

CITY OF LOUISVILLE v. CUMBERLAND TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH COMPANY.
APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY.
No. 761.

Argued March 7, 8, 1912.-Decided June 7, 1912.

Quwre, and not determined, whether an ordinance cutting the earnings
of a telephone company down, to six per cent per annum, would, under the circumstances of this case be confiscatory and unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.
This court requires clear evidence before it will declare legislation,
otherwise valid, to be void as an unconstitutional taking of property
by reason of establishing rates that are confiscatory.

Argument for Appellant.

In this case the evidence is not sufficient to justify enjoining enforcement of an ordinance fixing rates of a telephone company and the
decree granting an injunction is reversed, but without prejudice.

THE facts, which involve the question of whether an ordinance of the City of Louisville fixing rates for telephone
service in that city, was unconstitutional as confiscatory
of the property of the companies, are stated in the opinion.
Mr. Clayton B. Blakey and Mr. Huston Quinn, with
whom Mr. Joseph S. Lawton was on the brief, for appellant:
Questions referred to a master cannot in turn be referred to an accountant in such a manner that the report
of the accountant will bind the parties, the master or the
court. Kimberly v. Arms, 129 U. S. 512.
The court should assume that a telephone company will
charge the same rates to all of its subscribers
having the
same class of service. Knoxville v. Water Co., 212 U. S. 16.
A telephone company without a franchise or privilege
to occupy the streets of a city is a trespasser and should
not be permitted to question a rate regulating ordinance.

In determining the value of a telephone plant when it
charges that a rate ordinance confiscates its property the
true method is to ascertain what it would cost to reproduce a plant, then deduct from the reproduction cost the
amount the plant in question has depreciated. Knoxville
v. Water Co., 212 U. S. 1.
In determining the value of a telephone plant where it
claims that a city rate ordinance confiscates its property
the value of the franchise should not be considered.

Co., 99 Maine, 371.
Rates charged by telephone companies in other cities of,
substantially the same size and similarly located as the
city in question are a fair criterion in determining the
reasonableness of telephone rates. Interstate Corn; Comm.

MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill to prevent the enforcement of an ordinance,
of the City of Louisville fixing telephone rates, passed in
1909, after the attempt of the city to deprive the appellee
of its franchise, when that seemed likely to fail. See
Louisville v. Cumberland Telephone-& Telegraph Co.; 224

fiscation. In consequence of the conclusion to which we
have come we shall make a much more summary statemient of the facts than in other circumstances might be
necessary. The case was referred to a Master and he reported in favor of the city. He was of opinion that in
the first year after the ordinance should go into effect
there would be a loss of $30,000, but that in another year
or so, in view of the probable increase of subscribers, the
company would get back to its former net revenue with
a probable continuous increase thereafter, and would earn
a sufficient return. The judge was of a different opinion,
and for the purposes of the present decision only we shall
adopt his figures subject to the changes that we shall
state which leave us unprepared to sustain the decree
without giving the ordinance a trial to show its actual
effect.

Syllabus.

225 U. S.

We express no opinion whether to cut this telephone
company down to six per cent. by legislation would or
would not be confiscatory. But when it is remembered
what clear evidence the court requires before it declares
legislation otherwise valid void on this ground, and when
it is considered how speculative every figure is that we
have set down with delusive exactness, we are of opinion
that the result is too near the dividing line not to make
actual experiment necessary. The Master thought that
the probable net income for the year that would suffer
the greatest decrease would be 8.60 per cent. on the values
estimated by him. The Judge on assumptions to which
we have stated our disagreement makes the present earnings 51ยฐ/17 per cent. with a reduction by the ordinance to
3'/17 per cent. The whole question is too much in the air
for us to feel authorized to let the irijunction stand.
Decree reversed without prejudice.

MESSENGER v. ANDERSON.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT. OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 150.

Argued January 19, 22, 1912.-Decided June 2, 1912.

Where the Circuit Court of Appeals has before it in the second trial
of the same case, a will previously construed by it, and meanwhile
the highest court of the State in which the real estate affected is
situated has construed the will differently,'the Circuit Court of Appeals is not bound to adhere to its previous decision as being the law
of the case. It may follow, and in such a case it should lean toward
an agreement with, the state court.

the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering
them in the same case, mercly-expresses the practice of courts gen-
