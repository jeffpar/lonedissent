UNITED STATES v. NEDERLANDSCH-AMERIKAANSCHE STOOMVAART' MAATSCHAPPIJ
(HOLLAND-AMERICA LIJN.)
APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
No. 53. Argued January 28, 1920; restored to docket for reargument
October 11, 1920; reargued November 17, 1920.-Decided December 6, 1920.
A foreign steamship company alleged that, under duress practiced by
the immigration authorities, it paid bills rendered by them under
color of the Immigration Act, for maintenance and medical care
furnished by the United States to certain immigrants who, after
landing from the company's ships, were temporarily detained before
being admitted to the country, and it claimed reimbursement under
the Tucker Act, upon the ground that the exactions were in violation
of its rights as an alien subject, secured by the Constitution, treaties
and laws of the United States. Held, that the claim, being founded
on alleged torts of federal officials, was not within the Tucker Act or
the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. P. 155.
53 Ct. Chns. 522, reversed.
THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis for the United
States.
Mr. Howard Mansfield, with whom Mr. Lucius H. Beers

and Mr. Franklin Grady were on the briefs, for appellee:

The claim sued on is founded both upon a law of Congress and upon a regulation of an execitive department of
the Government, and the Court of Claims clearly had

jurisdiction. Patton v. Brady, 184-U. S. 608, 611; Dooley
v. United States, 182 U. S. 222; United States v. Lynah,

Argument for Appellee.

The cases cited by the Government hold, what is not
disputed, that Congress has not permitted suits against
the Government for mere torts, nor for tortious acts of its
representatives, unless the. claim is founded upon the
Constitution, some law of Congress, or some regulation of
an executive department. Attention is not drawn to any
decision of this court holding that when an officer or other
representative of the United States, professing to act
under a law of Congress, wrongfully exacts money from an
individual, and pays the money into the United States
Treasury, the United States has not authorized a suit for
the recovery of such money. Distinguishing: Ball IEngineering Co. v. White & Co., 250 U. S. 46; Tempel v.
United States, 248 U. S. 121; Basso v. United States, 239
U. S. 602; United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., 234 U S.
228; Peabody' v. United States, 231 U. S. 530; Crozier v.
Krupp, 224 U. S. 290; Harley v. United States, 198 U. S.
229; Russell v. United States, 182 U. S. 516; Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163; Langford v.
United States, 101 U. S. 341; Gibbons v. United States, 8
Wall. 269.
These cases hold no more than that the United States
cannot be sued for a tort, unless the case arises (1) under
the Constitution, (2) under a law of Congress, or (3) under
a regulation of an executive department.'
No liability was imposed by law upon claimant to pay
the hospital expenses of aliens ultimately admitted to the
United States.
Claimant was under no contract obligation to pay such
expenses.
These expenses were'payable out of the head tax fund,
pravided by Congress for that purpose, and ample in
amount.
The payments having been involuntarily made under
compulsion and duress, claimant is entitled to recover the
amounts paid.

OCTOBER TERM, 1920.
Opinion of the Court.

254 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE DAY delivered the opinion of the court.
A suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the
Holland-American Line to recover from the United States
for the cost of the maintenance and medical care furnished by the United States for certain aliens brought by
the plaintiff to this country on the steamers of its line
which it had been required to pay.
The petition sets forth that the United States, immigration officials temporarily detained some aliens in hospitals
because they were alleged to be suffering from temporary
illness, or accompanied aliens who were so suffering, and
subsequently permitted them to enter the country; the
aliens were detained and subsequently admitted under
the act of Congress known as the Immigration Act, passed
February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898. It is stated that
the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the Commissioner General of Immigration, and their subordinates,
claiming to act under the authority of the Immigration
Act, rendered to the petitioner from month to month bills
for the hospital treatment and maintenance of the aliens
so detained and subsequently admitted. Certain regulations of the Commissioner General of Immigration are
cited; and it is alleged that the United States officials
threatened that, if the bills were not paid, thereafter all
aliens so brought to this country would be held on board
ship until their application for admission to the United
States should be finally adjudicated. It is set forth that on
all vessels arriving in the port of New Yoilk there were
aliens who were temporarily detained and subsequently
admitted; that detention on board ship would have delayed the sailing of petitioner's vessels for periods varying from a few days to several weeks. The threats were
actually carried out,'at least in one instance, and if vessels
were so detained the result would have been not merely
great inconvenience and financial loss to the petitioner,

Opinion of the Court.

but a complete disruption of oceanic commerce in the
port of New York and the United States. "Consequently,
the petitioner paid, under duress and involuntarily, the
bills, when rendered."
It is alleged that the exaction of such payments of the
petitioner, and the making of such threats, were entirely
without warrant of law; that the Immigration Act provides that, where a suitable building is used for the detention and examination of aliens, the immigration officials
shall there take charge of such aliens and the transportation companies shall be relieved of the responsibility for
their detention thereafter; that there was in the port of
New York a suitable building for the detention and
examination of aliens; that the Immigration Act required
petitioner to pay the United States $4.00 for each alien
entering the United States on its vessels; that the aliens
whose hospital and maintenance expense bills were
rendered to and paid by the petitioner, were detained and
examined and subsequently admitted to the United States
pursuant to the requirements of the Immigration Act;
that special appropriations have been made for all expenses of the enforcement of the laws regulating the
immigration of aliens into the United States, so that there
has always been an available fund in the United States
Treasury for the payment of the expenses of regulating
the immigration of aliens into the United States, including
the hospital bills referred to above.
Petitioner recites disagreement, as to such charges,
between the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the
steamship companies transporting aliens to the United
States, and sets forth that an action was brought by the
United States in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York against the petitioner, to
recover hospital charges for aliens brought to the port of
New York and temporarily detained and subsequently
admitted. A judgment in favor of the Company was

254 U. S.

subsequently reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals
and was there affirmed. (See 212 Fed. Rep. 116, affirmed
by an equally divided court, 235 U. S. 686.)
It is further alleged that the exaction from the claimant
of the above mentioned hospital charges under duress was
in violation of its rights and privileges secured to petitioner as a subject of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
under the Constitution of the United States, by the
treaties between the United States and the Kingdom of
the Netherlands and the laws of the United States; that
the amounts thus unlawfully exacted from the claimant
were remitted to the Commissionet of Immigration at the
port of New York as required by him.
There being no demurrer, plea, answer, counterclaim,
set-off, claim of damages, demand, or defense in the
premises on the part of the United States, the Court of
Claims directed a general traverse under the rules of the
court, and afterwards made findings of fact, and, substantially following the decision of the Circuit Court of
Appeals, supra, held the United States liable for the
payments exacted.
As to the claim that the plaintiff had bound 'itself by
contract to pay these charges, the court held that the
claimant was coerced into makiig the contract by threats
of the defendant which would have destroyed the plaintiff's business if ever executed.
The Government contends that-the claim thus presented
was one sounding in tort, and, consequently, not within
the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and that the
petition should have been dismissed.
The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims rests upon ยง 145
of the Judicial Code, reenactment of the Tucker Act of
March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. 505, The jurisdiction
conferred includes:
"All claims (except for pensions) founded upon the
Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress,

UNITED STATES v. HOLLAND-AMERICA LIJN.
148.

153

Opinion of the Court.

upon any regulation of an Executive Department, upon
any contract, express or implied, with the Government of
the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which
claims the party would be entitled to redress against the
United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty
if the United States were suable."
We think that the statement of the substance of the
petitioner's claim, as above set forth, shows that it rested
upon payments alleged to have been made under duress
because of the wrongful and tortious acts of officials of
the United States Government acting without authority
of law in coercing the claimant to pay the sums demanded.
In many decisions of this court it has been held that by
the provisions of the Tucker Act the Government did not
subject itself to liability for the torts or wrongful acts of its
officers. Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall. 269; Morgan v.
United States) 14 Wall. 531; Hill v. United States, 149 U. S.
593; Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163; United
States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., 234 U. S.228; Tempel v. United
States, 248 U. S.121; Ball EngineeringCo. v. White & Co.,
250 U. S. 46.
The appellee relies upon and quotes certain expressiens
found in the opinion delivered in Dooley v. United Stazd,
182 U. S. 222. In Basso v. United States, 239 U. S.602,
suit was brought in the Court of Claims for the illegal
arrest and imprisonment of the claimant upon a charge
of having imported goods from the United States into
Porto Rico without having made entry of the same
under an act of Congress which the appellant alleged was
not in force in Porto Rico. It was alleged that the
court was without jurisdiction, and that, therefore, the
trial, conviction and sentence of imprisonment deprived
him of, his liberty Without due process of law in violation
of the Constitution. The United States filed a general

154

254 U. S.

traverse of the petition, and subsequently moved to dismiss upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction as
the action sounded in tort. This motion was sustained in
the Court of Claims, and an appeal taken to this court.
Speaking of the contention of the appellant that the Court
of Claims had jurisdiction, this court said:
"He, however, contends that the Court of Claims has
jurisdiction under the Tucker Act over claims ex delicto
founded upon the Constitution of the United States. 'And,
this, he further contends, is supported by the recent decisions of this court, and relies especially upon Dooley v.
United States, 182 U. S. 222.
"But that case did not overrule Schillinger v. United
States, 155 U. S. 163, which, counsel says, holds directly
contrary to his contention and that he has not the ingenuity to suggest how the court can now decide the case at
bar in appellant's favor without at least by implication
overruling the Schillinger Case. We are not disposed
to overrule the case, either directly or by implication.
"The Dooley Case and cases subsequent to it which are
relied upon by appellant concerned the exaction of duties
or taxes by the United States or its officers or property
taken by the Government for public purposes. In such
cases jurisdiction in the Court of Claims for the recovery
of the duties and taxes or for the value of the property
taken was declared.
"In the case at bar (assuming as true all that is charged)
there was a wrong inflicted, if a wrong can be said to have
been inflicted by the sentence of a court legally constituted
after judgment upon issues openly framed by the opposing
parties both of fact and the applicable law, whether that
law was ยงยง 2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes or the
Constitution of the United States. But conceding that a
wrong was inflicted through these judicial forms, the case
nevertheless is of different character from the Dooley

UNITED STATES v. HOLLAND-AMERICA LIJN. 155
'148.

Opinion of the Court.

Case, as was also the Schillinger Case. The latter case
passed upon the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in
actions founded on tort and declared the general principle
to be, based on a policy imposed by necessity, that governments are not liable (155 U. S., p. 167), 'for unauthorized
wrongs inflicted on the citizen by their officers, though
occurring while engaged in the discharge of official duties.'
And it was further said (p. 168): 'Congress has wisely
reserved to itself the right to give or withhold relief where
the claim is founded on wrongful proceedings of an officer
of the Government.' Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall.
269, 275; Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531, 534."
The principle, reaffirmed in the case just quoted, is
applicable here for the reason that the claim presented
sounded in tort, and was in substance an action to recover
for the wrongful acts of the United States officials in
compelling the claimant to pay under duress and without
authority of law the sums sued for. Following the wellestablished construction of the Tucker Act, as declared
in many cases in this court, we think that the Court of
Claims should have dismissed the petition because it
presented a claim not within its jurisdiction. The judginent of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause
remanded to that court with instructions to dismiss the
petition.
Reversed.
