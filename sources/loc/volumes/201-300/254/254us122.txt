Third. It is stated in the brief, doubtless inadvertently,
that the assignment of errors includes the objection that

the tax was void under the Fourteenth Amendment also
on the ground that the company, a foreign corporation,

had made large permanent investments in Connecticut
before the statute of 1915 was enacted. No such error
appears to have been specifically assigned and the objection was not pressed in brief or oral argument. It is
clearly unsound. To the facts presented here the principle
discussed in Southern Ry. Co. v. Greene, 216 U. S. 400, 414,

has no application.

WATSON ET AL., EXECUTORS OF WATSON, v.
STATE COMPTROLLER OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK.
ERROR TO THE SURROGATE' S COURT OF NEW YORK COUNTY,
STATE OF NEW YORK.
No. 266. Argued October 13, 1920.-Decided November 15, 1920.
In imposing transfer or inheritance taxes, a State may distinguish
between property which has borne its fair share of tax burden in the
decedent's lifetime and property of the same kind and passing to the
same class of transferees, which has not. P. 124.
The additional tax imposed in New York (Cons. Laws, c. 60; Laws
1917, c. 700), on the transfer of certain kinds of securities held by
a decedent at his death on which neither the general property tax
nor the alternative stamp tax has been paid during a fixed period
prior thereto, is based upon a reasonable classification of property
and does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Id.
This tax is neither a property tax nor a penalty. P. 125.
226 N. Y. 384, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.

Opinion of the Court.

and Mr. Edward R. Greene were on the brief, for plaintiffs
in error.

Mr.-John B. Gleason for defendant in error.
MR. JUsTiCE BRANDIs

delivered the opinion of the

court.
The New York Tax Law (Consolidated Laws, c. 60)
provides (Article 1, ยง 9) that personal property shall be
assessed and taxed to the ownefi-at the place where he
resides, bit exempts (Article 15) from' such taxation
certain bonds and other obligations, called in the adt
investments, on which there has been paid an optional
tax at a lower rate, which payment is evidenced by a
stamp affixed. The Tax Law also provides (Article 10)
for an inheritance or transfer tax which varies, among
other things, according to the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent. By ยง 221-b, Laws of 1917, c. 700,
ยง 2, an additional tax equal to 5 per cen. of the appraised
value of the investment is imposed 6n the transfer of
investments held by the decedent .at his death on which
neither the general property tax nor the stamp tax above
described has been paid during a fixed period prior thereto,
provided that the estate is larger than the exemptions to
relatives and charities.
Watson, a resident of New York City, held, at his
death in 1917, certain bonds on which neither the general
property tax nor the stamp tax had been paid. The
transfer tax appraiser, appointed by the Surrogate's
Court, reported that there was payable by the executors
in respect to those bonds the additional transfer iax
prescribed by the Act of 1917. The Surrogate disallowed
the tax on the ground that the statute violated the state
constitution; and his decision was affirmed by the Appel-

late Division of the Supreme_ Court, 186 App. Div. 48.
The Court of Appeals of New York held that the act
violated neither the state nor the Federal Constitution,
226 N. Y. 384; and the',case comes here on writ of error.
The contention is that the tax imposed denies to Watson's
estate equal protection of the laws.
The occasion and the purpose of the statute are shown
by the Court of Appeals. An owner of investments is not
required either to list them for assessment locally under
the general property tax law or to present them for stamping under the investment tax law. Whether the investments of a resident are taxed during his life depends either
upon his own will or upon the vigilance and discretion of
the local assessors. This condition led to loss of revenue
by the State and to inequality in taxation among its
citizens. To remedy both evils this additional transfer
tax was imposed upon investments of a decedent which
had wholly escaped taxation. It is insisted that the tax
is discriminatory because under it other property of the
same kind bequeathed to persons standing in the same
relationship to the decedent will not be taxed. But the
power to classify for purposes of taxation is fully established. The executors admit, as they must, that a
classification is reasonable if made with respect to the
kind of property transferred; or, to the amount or value of
property transferred; or, to the relationship of the transferees; or, to the-character of the transferee, for instance
as engaged in charity. Magoun v. Iinois Trust & Savings
Bank, 170 U. S. 283, 300; Billings v. Illinois, 188 U. S.
97; Campbell v. California, 200 U. S. 87. But their list
does not exhaust the possibilities of legal classification.
See Beers v. Glynn, 211 U. S. 477, 484; Keeney v. New

York, 222 U. S. 525; Maxwell v. Bugbee, 250 U. S.
525. Compare Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152. Any
classification is permissible which has a reasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action. It

Opinion of the Court.

is not necessary, as the plaintiff in error seems to contend,
that the basis of the classification must be deducible from
the nature of the things classified,-here the right to
receive property by devolution. It is enough, for instance,
if the classification is reasonably founded in "the purposes
and policy of taxation." Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert,
142 U. S. 339, 354; Kidd r.Alabama, 188 U. S. 730, 732;
Clement National Bank v. Vermont, 231 U. S. 120, 136137; Farmers Bank v. Minnesota, 232 U. S. 516, 529-530.
And what classification could be more reasonable than to
distinguish, in imposing an inheritance or transfer tax,
between property which had during the decedent's life
borne its fair share of the tax burden and that which had
not? 1
It does not follow, as is also argued, that the act in
question imposes a property tax, merely because its
existence may induce owners of investments to present
them for taxation under the Investment Tax Law. Nor
is it to be deemed a law imposing'a penalty merely because
the decedent's estate may under it be required to pay
more in taxes than the deceased would have paid if he
had presented his property for taxation under the Investment Tax Law. Whether this additional transfer tax
would be obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment if it
could be deemed a property tax or a penalty, we have
no occasion to consider.
The judgment of the Surrogate's Court entered on the
remittitur from the Court of Appeals of New York is
Affirmed.
Connecticut kGen. Stats. 1918, ยง 1190) and Louisiana (Constitution,
1898, Arts. 235, 236; Act 45 of 1904) also impose a special inheritance
tax on the transfer of property which has not borne its share of taxation
during a period prior to the owner's death. The latter statute has been
frequently before the courts, Succession of Mathias Levy, 115 La.
377, 385; aff'd Cahen v. Brewster, 203 U. S. 543; Succesgion of Pritchard, 118 La. 883;.Succession of Westfeld&, 122 La. 836.
