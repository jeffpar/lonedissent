No. 133. Submitted January 13,1921.-Decided January 24, 1921.
1. By the law of Panama, a railroad company is liable for the negligence of its servants and damages are recoverable for pain in a case

by the jury on conflicting evidence of experts. Id.
3. Due care may require a railroad company to keep a flagman at a
dangcrous street crossing. Id.
4. Conduct that would be contributory negligence as a matter of law

deliVered the opinion of the court.

This is an action brought in the District Court of the
Caital Zone for the Division of Cristobal to recover from
the Panama Railroad Company for personal injuries suffered by the minor, Pigott, in the City of Colon, Republic

PANAMA R. R. v. PIGOTT.
552.

Opinion of the Court.

of Panama. Pigott recovered a judgment which was
affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 256 Fed. Rep.
837. The case is brought to this Court under the Panama
Canal Act, August 24, 1912, c. 390, ยง 9, 37 Stat. 560, 566.
The facts may be stated in a few words. The minor, a
boy of seven, was run over when attempting to cross the
railroad track on a street in Colon. There was evidence
that the crossing was much used and that, especially in
the afternoon, the time of the accident, there usually
were many children about; there were, however, neither
gates nor a watchman at the place. A hedge higher than
the child somewhat obstructed the view. The engine was
backing a box car and did not have the'lookout required
by the company's rules There was evidence also that it
gave no warning by bell or whistle. In short by the criteria
of the common law the plaintiff had a right to go to the
jury with his case.
The fundamental argument for the plaintiff in error is
that the law of Panama was not applied in determining
the principles of liability or in fixing the rule of damages.
It is contended that if, as there was evidence to prove,
due care had been used in the selection of servants- by
the railroad, the company was not answerable for their
negligence, and that in any event there could be no recovery for pain. Both of these contentions are simply
attempts to reargue what was decided in Panama R. R.
Co. v. Toppin, 252 U. S. 308. The plaintiff in error certainly did not get less than it Was entitled to when, in
view of contradictory testimony from lawyers on the two
sides, the Court left the law of Panama to the jury. The
Court was warranted in also leaving to the jury the question whether proper care required the company to have
a flagman or gate at the crossing and the other safeguards
that we have mentioned. Grand Trunk Ry. C6. v. Ives,
144 U. S. 408. In view of the extreme youth of the plaintiff we cannot say that the court erred in allowing the jury

to attribute his misfortune to the defendant's conduct
alone, whatever difficulties there might be in the case of
an older person; and we perceive no other ground for not
allowing the verdict and the decision of the two courts
below to stand.
