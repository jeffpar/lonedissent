HELVERING v. CANFIELD.
Syllabus.

138

We think it may fairly be said that the improvements
here in question on the Pigeon River constituted structures and uses which had been permitted by the Parties
prior to the treaty of 1909 and were recognized by that
treaty. It does not appear that any action has been taken
by either Government or by the International Joint Commission inconsistent with this view.
We conclude that it was error to sustain the demurrer
to the amended complaint. The judgment of the Circuit
Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded
for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
Reversed.

No. 158.

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

CIRCUIT.

Argued December 13, 1933.-Decided January 15, 1934.

The Revenue Act of 1921, ยง 201 (a) (b), provides that any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders out of profits
accumulated since February 28, 1913, is taxable; and, for the
purposes of the Act, every distribution is regarded as made from
the most recently accumulated profits to the extent that they
have accumulated since that date; but profits accumulated prior to
March 1, 1913 may be distributed exempt from tax after profits
accumulated since February 28, 1913, have been distributed. A
corporation with a surplus on March 1, 1913, made a distribution
after ensuing years in the earlier of which it suffered losses and in
the later of which it made profits. Held that, to determine the
amount exempt under the statute, the losses should be deducted
from the surplus of March 1, 1913, not be charged against the
subsequent profits. P. 166.
62 F. (2d) 751, reversed.
65 F. (2d) 234, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 611, to review two judgments rendered upon appeals taken by two stockholders of the same
corporation, in different circuits, from a decision of the
Board of Tax Appeals, 24 B.T.A. 480.

Mr. H. Brian Holland, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs and Messrs. Sewall Key and Andrew D. Sharpe were
on the brief, for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Mr. Edwin H. Cassels, with whom Messrs. Barry
Gilbert and Adolphus E. Graupner were on the brief,
for Canfield and Thorsen.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
These cases present the question of the construction
of the following provisions of ยง 201 of the Revenue Act of
1921, 42 Stat. 228:
"Sec. 201. (a) That the term 'dividend' when used
in this title . . . means any distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders or members, whether in cash
or in other property, out of its earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, . . .
"(b) For the purposes of this Act every distribution is
made out of earnings or profits, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits, to the extent of
such earnings or profits accumulated since February 28,
1913; but any earnings or profits accumulated or increase
in value of property accrued prior to March 1, 1913, may
be distributed exempt from the tax, after the earnings
and profits accumulated since February 28, 1913, have
been distributed. . ....
The respondent in No. 158 and the petitioner in No. 212
are stockholders of the West Side Lumber Company, a
California corporation. The question is as to the amount

properly taxable against them as their respective shares
of a dividend of $5,100,000 paid by that company on April
14, 1923.
The findings.of fact state that in addition to its original
capital of $1,500.000, the company had a surplus on
March 1, 1913, of $4,332,684.78. Its profits and losses in
the following years-ending on February 28 in each
year-were as follows: 1914, a profit of $4,594.62; 1915, a
loss of $193,139.67; 1916, a loss of $211,707.32; 1917 to
1923, inclusive, and from February 28, 1923 to April 14,
1923, profits aggregating $2,450,688.30. Prior to the dividend here involved, and for the years 1918 to 1923, the
company had paid dividends amounting to $1,290,000.
The question is as to the proper treatment of the losses
of 1915 and 1916. If these losses, over the profits of
1914, are not treated as reducing the surplus of March 1,
1913, but are charged against the subsequent profits, the
entire amount of that surplus, or $4,332,684.78 was distributable exempt from the tax after the profits subsequent to February 28, 1913, had been distributed. On
this basis, for which the taxpayers contend, the profits
accumulated after February 28, 1913, would be deemed
to amount to $2,050,435.93, leaving subject to the tax,
after deducting prior dividends, the sum of $760,435.93.
If the losses of 1915 and 1916, over the profits of 1914,
are treated as reducing the surplus of March 1, 1913,
there remained of that surplus, on February 28, 1916, the
sum of $3,932,432.41, which was distributable exempt
from the tax after the subsequent profits had been distributed. With this application of the losses of 1915 and
1916, the subsequent profits subject to tax, after deducting prior dividends, amounted to $1,160,688.30.
The Board of Tax Appeals adopted the latter view and
directed the determination of deficiencies accordingly. 24

B.T.A. 480. That decision was overruled by the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit as to the respondent Canfield in No. 158, 62 F. (2d) 751, and was
sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit as to the petitioner Thorsen in No. 212, 65 F. (2d)
234. The cases come here on certiorari.
In deciding between these conflicting views, the outstanding, and we think the controlling, fact is that on
February 28, 1916, the surplus of March 1, 1913, had actually been diminished by losses. The company continued in business after March 1, 1913, and exposed its
accumulated profits to the hazard of that business. On
February 28, 1914, the company still had those profits
and an additional profit of $4,594.62. But in the next
two years the company lost $404,846.99, so that the surplus of March 1, 1913, was invaded. It is inaccurate to
say that this was merely a matter of bookkeeping. Under the findings of fact the losses must be deemed to have
been actual losses, not mere bookkeeping entries. Hence,
the decrease of the preibxisting surplus was actual-as
real as the prexisting surplus itself, as real as the subsequent profits. The surplus of March 1, 1913, was the
amount of net assets over liabilities including capital
stock.' When the losses of 1915 and 1916 were suffered,
the net assets of March 1, 1913, shrunk accordingly.
In the presence of that inescapable fact, the question is
not whether the company could distribute, as being surplus of March 1, 1913, what no longer remained of that
surplus-a manifest impossibility-but whether the
statute entitled the company to treat subsequent profits
as restoring what had been lost of the surplus of March 1,
1913, so that, to the extent of that replacement, the subsequent profits could be distributed to stockholders free

of tax. That the question is one of such a replacement
would be strikingly evident if the whole of the surplus of
March 1, 1913, had been lost and an attempt had been
made to treat later profits as restoring it. The fact that
only a part of the surplus was lost does not alter the
question as related to that part.
The argument that the surplus of March 1, 1913, constituted capital is unavailing. We are not here concerned
with capital in the sense of fixed or paid-in capital, which
is not to be impaired, or with the restoiation of such
capital where there has been impairment.2 No case of
impairment of capital is presented. We are dealing with
a distribution of accumulated profits. Nor is it important that the accumulated profits, as they stood on March
1, 1913, constituted capital of the company as distinguished from the gains or income which the company
subsequently realized.3 When a corporation continued
in business after March 1, 1913, the dividends it later
declared and paid to its stockholders, whether out of
current earnings or from profits accumulated prior to
that date, constituted income to the stockholders, and
not capital, and were taxable as income if the Congress
saw fit to impose the tax. Lynch v. Hornby, 247 U.S.
339. The provision of the Act of Oongress under consideration was a "concession to the equity of stockholders " with respect to receipts as to which they had no
constitutional immunity. There is no question here of
the receipt of "capital."
The fundamental contention of the taxpayers is that
the statute created two distinct periods for tax purposes;
that the accumulations for each period constituted "a

fixed and static amount, not to be changed by happenings
after the end of the period." That the statute does relate
to two periods, the dividing line being March 1, 1913, and
that the periods are distinct, is obvious. But it does not
follow because there are two distinct periods that the accumulations for each period constitute "a fixed and static
amount" and are to remain unaffected despite the vicissitudes of business. To attribute to the accumulated
profits or surplus of March 1, 1913, embarked in a continued business, such a static condition is to ignore the
course of business and to impute to the Congress an intention to consider, for tax purposes, the existence of that
surplus as still continued notwithstanding its actual diminution or exhaustion. Such an intention to disregard
realities so as to afford immunity from a tax is not lightly
to be ascribed to the taxing authority. The "equity of
stockholders," which we said in Lynch v. Hornby, supra,
the Congress probably had in view, might reasonably require freedom from taxation on receiving a distribution
of the accumulated profits of March 1, 1913, where those
profits remained intact, but that equity is not apparent
when those profits had been lost in whole or in part and
immunity is sought from the taxation of an equivalent
amount of profits subsequently earned.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of ยง 201 disclose a single purpose and are to be construed in harmony with each other.
They show that the Congress was careful to arrange its
plan so that the right to receive, free of tax, a distribution
of surplus accumulated prior to March 1, 1913, should not
be exercised in such a fashion as to permit profits accumulated after that date to escape taxation. To that end
the Congress provided that "every distribution is made
out of earnings or profits, and from the most recently accumulated earnings or profits, to the extent of such earnings or profits accumulated since February 28, 1913."
Then follows the exemption which is strictly limited to a

distribution of profits accumulated prior to March 1, 1913.
Nothing is said as to a restoration of those profits out of
subsequent earnings if the former have been lost.
The argument for the stockholders stresses the word
"accumulated."
We think that the expression is made
to carry too heavy a burden. The argument is substantially the same as that which is based on what seems to
us to be an artificial conception of the two periods. What
had been "accumulated" prior to March 1, 1913, was
obviously not immune from the risk of loss. It is urged
that the same rule should be applied whether the losses
in the subsequent years preceded or succeeded the making
of profits. But the actual course of events is not to be
ignored. If there had been profits immediately after
March 1, 1913, sufficient in amount to absorb later losses
incurred before the time of distribution, it is manifest
that the profits accumulated prior to March 1, 1913,
would have remained intact. The case is different where,
in the absence of such profits, losses necessarily diminish
the prior accumulations. Thus, in the instant case there
were no profits accumulated after March 1, 1913, and
prior to February 28, 1916, except the small amount in
1914 which was wiped out by the losses of the two succeeding years. The profits from February 28, 1916, to
February 28, 1919, amounted to .327,134.45. If there
had been a distribution of these profits on February 28,
1919, it could not have been maintained that they constituted part of the surplus existing on March 1, 1913, or
that they should escape taxation on the theory that they
made good prior losses which had actually reduced that
surplus. And the same is true of the profits subsequently
made. Administrative practice appears to have been in
accord with this view. See A.R.M. 82, 3 Cumulative
Bulletin 36 (1920).
Our conclusion is that the judgment of the Circuit

v. UNION CENTRAL LIFE INSURANCE CO.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 208. Argued December 14, 1933.-Decided January 15, 1934.
1. A paid-up addition to a policy of life insurance is an amount added
to the face of the policy, paid for by a single premium, for which
there must be a legal reserve. P. 173.
2. This is the meaning of the term "dividend additions," as used in
Art. 7432, Par. 7, Rev. Civ. Stats. of Texas, 1925. P. 181.
3. A paid-up addition is distinct from extended insurance. P. 173.
4. The policy provided: "In the event of the death of the insured
during the days of grace, the current premium being unpaid, if no
other option has been elected, or if the policy shall lapse, the dividend then due shall be paid in cash." Held applicable where the
policy lapsed and the insured died after the days of grace. P. 174.
5. A level premium participating policy provided that upon lapse
for non-payment of premium, if the insured failed to exercise specified options, the dividend due him for the current year should be
paid him in cash, and the surrender value of the policy (defined
as equal to the reserve at the end of the policy year, less surrender
charges), together with the value of any paid-up additions, and
accumulations of dividends at interest, should be applied to the
extension of the policy as term insurance from the date to which
premiums had been paid, first deducting any indebtedness or advances on the policy. Held:
(1) That a current dividend as to which the insured had exercised no option, was inapplicable to increase the extension of
insurance but was payable in cash. P. 176.
(2) A dividend is no part of the surrender value. P. 176.
(3) The provisions as to paid-up additions and accumulations of,
dividends at interest have no relation to such current dividend or
to earlier dividends applied in reduction of premiums. P. 178.
