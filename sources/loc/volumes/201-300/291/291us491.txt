LANDRESS v. PHOENIX INS. Co.

Syllabus.

That Congress, with consent of the taxpayer, has power
to reinstate his tax liability and to authorize assessment
of the tax cannot be doubted. Graham& Fosterv. Goodcell, 282 U.S. 409, 426; Mascot Oil Co. v. United States,
282 U.S. 434. The taxpayer cannot complain that Congress has availed itself of the consent which he has given,
and cannot object that it did so by revival of the tax "liability," rather than by removing the bar of the statute as
in McDonnell v. United States, supra, and Stange v.
United States, supra; see Wm. Danzer & Co. v. Gulf &
S. I. R. Co., 268 U.S. 633, 636; Home Insurance Co. v.
Dick, 281 U.S. 397, 409.
We have considered, but do not discuss respondent's
arguments based on the construction of the waiver of
November 6, 1926, which are without merit. We do not
doubt that rightly construed the waiver conformed to the
requirements of §§ 278 and 280 of the Act of 1926, and
that by it respondent consented to the deficiency
assessment.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT.

No. 295.

Argued February 5, 1934.-Decided March 5, 1934.

1. A death resulting from sunstroke, the insured having under normal
conditions voluntarily exposed himself to the sun while playing
golf, is not within the meaning of a policy insuring against death
effected solely by external and accidental means. P. 495.
2. That an injury was accidental in the understanding of the average
man-that the result was something unforeseen or extraordinaryincongruous results are avoided by treating § 1106 ,(a) as though it
had never been a part of the 1926 Act, as § 612 directs. See United
States v. Katz, 271 U.S. 354.

is not enough to establish liability under a policy which limits
liability to such injuries as are effected by external accidental
means. Pp.*495, 497.
65 F. (2d) 232, affirmed.

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 614, to review a judgment affirming a judgment against the claimant on policies of insurance in two cases which were consolidated for trial in the
district court.

Mr. William L. Frierson, with whom Mr. R. P. Frierson was on the brief, for petitioner.
The decision below is based squarely on the view that
the death resulted from the voluntary act of exposure to
the heat of the sun and hence the injury was not effected
through accidental means.
I In other words, because insured did only what
he intended in the way he intended, it follows that the resulting injury was not brought about by accidental means.'
This ignores (1) the rule that when one does an intentional act he is deemed to intend only the consequences
which naturally and in ordinary course of things result
from such an act, and (2) the fact that death is not one
of the things which can reasonably be expected to result
from playing golf.
The Court must determine which of two lines of cases
has correctly interpreted Mutual Accident Assn. v. Barry,
131 U.S. 100.
The court below and some other courts hold, in effect,
that the intervening accidental cause can not be inferred
or presumed from the fact that the result of the intentional act is out of all proportion to what was reasonably
to be expected from the act. According to them, it is necessary to show, in some affirmative way, just what the
intervening cause was. These cases recognize that an unexpected, and unintended result may properly be, and
usually is, called an accidental result, but draw a distinc-

Argument for Petitioner.

tion between an accidental result and a result brought
about by accidental means. And so, in this case, counsel
seem to agree that insured suffered an accidental death,
but insist that the declarations do not show that it was
brought about by accidental means. This, it seems to
us, is a plain contradiction of terms. How is it possible
for any result to be accidental unless there is, an element
of the accidental in the means by which it is produced?
Certainly the distinction is too fine to be perceived by
the ordinary policyholder who, giving the language used
its ordinary meaning, naturally supposes he is insured
against accidental results.
The distinction has been rejected by most of the federal courts. They hold, in effect: (1) That when a result
is one which does not, in the usual course of things, follow and is not reasonably to be expected to follow, from a
given act, it is an accidental result. (2) That every accidental result is necessarily brought about by some accidental means or cause. (3) That when it appears that a
result was accidental, it is not necessary to show which of
the many accidental causes that might have produced it
did actually intervene.
This is the sound and rational construction to be put
on policies of this kind.

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

But even under the rule invoked by opposing counsel,
the demurrers to the third counts should have been overruled. Those counts alleged that the intervening accidental means or cause was the condition, unknown to the
insured, which, for the time being, rendered him supersensitive to the heat of the sun. This makes a case under
the sound rule that a voluntary act is an accidental act
if performed under conditions which, if known, would
have deterred from performance.
If one in sound health receives an accidental blow which
prqduces a disease followed by death, that death has resulted, independently of all other causes, from an accidental blow (Ryan v. Continental Casualty Co., 47 F.
(2d) 474; Order of United, etc. v. Edwards, 52 F. (2d)
187; Lower v. Metropolitan Ins. Co., 111 N.J.L. 426.)
But sunstroke should not be held to be a disease. It
does not have that meaning in the popular mind. Richards v. Standard Accident Ins. Co., 58 Utah 622; Lower

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case comes here on certiorari to review a judgment
of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 65 F. (2d)
232, which affirmed a judgment of the district court, denying recovery on two policies of accident insurance. Separate suits brought by petitioner, the beneficiary of the
policies under which her deceased husband was the insured, were consolidated and were heard and decided on
demurrer. The insured, while playing golf, suffered a
sunstroke, from which he died. Petitioner sought recov-

ery of amounts stipulated, in one policy, to be paid if
death should result
"directly and independently of all other causes from
bodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means, and not directly or indirectly, wholly or
partly from disease or physical or mental infirmity,"
and, in the other policy, if death should result
"from bodily injuries effected directly and independently
of all other causes through external, violent and accidental
means."
Both declarations, in each of four counts, alleged that
the deceased in the month of August, while in good health
and while playing golf in his accustomed manner at a
place where many others were playing without injury, was
suddenly and unexpectedly overcome from the force of
the sun's rays upon his head and body and that shortly
afterward he died; that an autopsy revealed that there
was no bodily infirmity or disease which could have been
a contributing cause of his death. In one count of each
declaration it was alleged that at the time the insured received the injury resulting in his death there was, unknown, to him, a temporary disorder or condition of his
body, not amounting to a physical or mental infirmity
within the meaning of the policies, which, for the time
being, rendered him more than ordinarily sensitive to the
heat of the sun and that this temporary and unknown
condition" intervened between his intentional act of playing golf, which he intended and expected to perform
safely and which others did perform safely at the same
time and place, and the injury which followed."
Petitioner argues that the death, resulting from voluntary exposure to the sun's rays under normal conditions,
was accidental in the common or popular sense of the
term and should therefore be held to be within the liability clauses of the policies. But it is not enough, to establish liability under these clauses, that the death or injury

was accidental in the understanding of the average manthat the result Qf the exposure "was something unfore,een, unsuspected, extraordinary, an unlooked for mishap,
and so an accident," see Lewis v. Ocean Accident & G.
Corp., 224 N.Y. 18, 21; 120 N.E. 56; see also Aetna Life
Ins. Co. v. Portland Gas & Coke Co., 229 Fed. 552-for
here the carefully chosen words defining liability distinguish between the result and the external means which
produces it. The insurance is not against an accidental result. The stipulated payments are to be made only if the
bodily injury, though unforeseen, is effected by means
which are external and accidental. The external means
is stated to be the"rays of the sun, to which the insured
voluntarily exposed himself. Petitioner's pleadings do
not suggest that there was anything in the sun's rays, the
weather or other circumstances, external to the insured's
own body and operating to produce the unanticipated injury, which was unknown or unforeseen by the insured.
We do not intimate that injuries resulting from as impalpable a cause as the inadvertent introduction into the
body of noxious germs may not be deemed to be effected
by external accidental means. See Western Commercial
Travelers Assn. v. Smith, 85 Fed. 401; Jensma v. Sun Life
Assur. Co., 64 F. (2d) 457. Nor do we say. that in other
circumstances an unforeseen and hence accidental result
may not give rise to the inference that the external means
was also accidental. Compare Jensma v. Sun Life Assur.
Co., supra; Gustafson v. New York Life Ins. Co., 55 F.
(2d) 235. But, in the light of such knowledge as we have,
no such inference can arise from the bare allegation of
death by sunstroke, compare Pope v. PrudentialIns. Co.,
29 F. (2d) 185; Ryan v. Continental Casualty Co., 47 F.
(2d) 472, with no indication that some unforeseen or unintended condition or combination -of circumstances, external to the state of the victim's body, contributed to the

accidental result. The petitioner has thus failed to plead
facts establishing the liability defined by the policy.
In U.S. Mutual Accident Assn. v. Barry, 131 U.S. 100,
the insured suffered an internal injury caused by his
jumping voluntarily from a platform to the ground, a distance of four or five feet. Recovery was allowed of
amounts stipulated by the policy to be paid upon proof
of bodily injury "effected through external violent and
accidental means." There was evidence from which the
jury might have inferred that the insured alighted in a
manner not intended, causing a jar or shock of unexpected
severity. This Court held that the trial judge correctly
left to the jury the question whether the insured jumped
or alighted in the manner he intended and properly
charged that, if he did not, it might find that the injury
was caused by accidental means, pp. 109, 110, 121.
This distinction between accidental external means and
accidental result has been generally recognized and applied where the stipulated liability is for injury resulting
from an accidental external means. See Aetna Life Ins.
Co. v. Brand, 265 Fed. 6; Lincoln National Ins. Co. v.
Erickson, 42 F. (2d) 997; Jensma v. Sun Life Assur. Co.,
supra; Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Shane,
64 F. (2d) 55; contra, Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Dodge, 11
F. (2d) 486. And injury from sunstroke, when resulting
from voluntary exposure by an insured to the sun's rays,
even though an accident, see Ismay, Imrie & Co.v. Williamson [1908] A: C. 437, has been generally held not to
have been caused by external accidental means. Nickman v. New York Life Ins. Co., 39 F. (2d) 763; Paist v.
Aetna Life Ins. Co,., 54 F. (2d) 303; Harloe v. California

Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO, dissenting.

I am unable to concur in the decision of the Court.
1. A cause does not cease to be violent and external because the insured has an idiosyncratic condition of mind
or body predisposing him to injury. Silverstein v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 254 N.Y. 81; 171 N.E. 914; Leland
v. Order of U. C. Travelers, 233 Mass. 558, 564; 124 N.E.
517; Collins v. Casualty Co., 224 Mass. 327; 112 N.E.
634; Taylor v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 176 Minn. 171; 222
N.W. 912. Under a policy phrased as this one, the insurer
may be relieved of liability if the predisposing condition
is so acute as to constitute a disease. See cases supra.
Here the complaint alleges that the idiosyncrasy was not
a physical or mental disease, and that it appeared from
an autopsy that there was no bodily infirmity or disease
which could have been a contributing cause of death.
Since the case is here on demurrer, those allegations must
be accepted as true. The plaintiff may be unable to prove
them at the trial. She should have the opportunity.
There has been no failure to " plead facts establishing the
liability defined by the policy."
2. Sunstroke, though it may be a disease according to
the classification of physicians, is none the less an accident in the common speech of men. Ismay, Imrie & Co.
v. Williamson, [1908] A.C. 437, 439. Lane v. Horn & H.
Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329; 104 AtI. 615. The suddenness
of its approach and its catastrophic nature (Connally v.
Hunt FurnitureCo., 240 N.Y. 83, 87; 147 N.E. 366) have
•made that quality stand out when thought is uninstructed
in 'the mysteries of science. Lower v. Metropolitan Life

Ins. Co., 111 N.J.L. 426; 168 Atl. 593, collating the decisions. Violent it is for the same reason, and external
because the train of consequences is set in motion by the
rays of the sun beating down upon the body, a cause operating from without.
" In my view this man died from an accident. What
killed him was a heat-stroke coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon him while at work. Such a stroke is an
unusual effect of a known cause, often, no doubt, threatened, but generally averted by precautions which experience, in this instance, had not taught. It was an unlooked
for mishap in the course of his employment. In common
language, it was a case of accidental death." Per Loreburn, L. C., in Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, supra.
3. The attempted distinction between accidental results
and accidental means will plunge this branch of the law
into a Serbonian Bog. " Probably it is true to say that in
the strictest sense and dealing with the region of physical
nature there is no such thing as an accident." Halsbury,
L. C. in Brintons v. Turvey, L.R. [1905] A.C. 230, 233.
Cf. Lewis v. Ocean Accident & Guaranty Corp., 224 N.Y.
18, 21; 120 N.E. 56; Innes v. Kynoch, [1919] A.C. 765,
775. On the other hand, the average man is convinced
that there is, and so certainly is the man who takes out
a policy of accident insurance. It is his reading of the
policy that is to be accepted as our guide, with the help
of the established rule that ambiguities and uncertainties
are to be resolved against the company. Mutual Life
Ins. Co. v. Hurni Packing Co., 263 U.S. 167, 174; Stipcich v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 277 U.S. 311, 322. The
proposed distinction will not survive the application of
that test.
When a man has died in such a way that his death is
spoken of as an accident, he has died because of an accident, and hence by accidental means. So courts of high
authority have held. Lower v. MetropolitanLife In Co.,

supra (a case of sunstroke); Gallagher v. Fidelity & Casualty Co., 163 App. Div. 556; 148 N.Y.S. 1016; 221 N.Y.
664; 117 N.E. 1067 (sunstroke); Jensma v. Sun Life Assurance Co., 64 F. (2d) 457; Western Commercial Travelers' Assn. v. Smith, 85 Fed. 401; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.
Dodge, 11 F. (2d) 486; Leus v. Ioa State Traveling
Men's Assn., 248 Fed. 602.' So the holder of this policy
might reasonably assume.
If he had thought about the subject, he might have had
his impressions fortified by the ruling of the House of
Lords that a workman who suffers a heat-stroke has a
.claim for relief under the Workmen's Compensation Act:
Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, supra. The British
Act (6 Edw. 7, c. 58, § 1) gives compensation for personal
injury "by accident" arising out of and in the course of
the employment. Injury by heat-stroke was held to be
injury "by accident." The result would hardly have
been different, certainly one insured would not have
looked for any difference, if for the phrase "injury by accident" the lawmakers had substituted the words injury
"by means of accident," or injury by accidental means.
The principle that should govern the interpretation of
the policy in suit was stated with clarity and precision by
Sanborn,
J., in a case quoted in the margin.2
The insured
did not do anything which in its ordinary
consequences was fraught with danger. The allegations

The decisions are collated in 17 A:L.R. 1197, with the comment
that by theweight of authority sunstroke suffered unexpectedly is
'within the coverage of a policy insuring against injury by external,

of the complaint show that he was playing golf in the same
conditions in which he had often played before. The
heat was not extraordinary; the exertion not unusual.
By misadventure or accident, an external force which had
hitherto been beneficent, was transformed into a force of
violence, as much so as a stroke of lightning. The opinion of the court concedes that death "from sunstroke,
when resulting from voluntary exposure to the sun's
rays," is "an accident." Why? To be sure the death
is not intentional, but that does not make it an " accident"
as the word is commonly understood, any more than death
from indigestion or pneumonia. If there was no accident
in the means, there was -none in the result, for the two
were inseparable. No cause that reasonably can be styledan accident intervened between them. The process of
causation was unbroken from exposure up to death.
There was an accident throughout, or there was no accident at all.
The judgment should be reversed.
'Western Commercial Travelers' Assn. v. Smith, supra, p. 405:
"An effect which is the natural and probable consequence of an act
or course of action is not an accident, nor is it produced by accidental
means. It is either the result of actual design, or it falls under the
maxim that every man must be held to intend the natural and probable consequence of his deeds. On the other hand, an effect which
is not the natural or probable consequence of the means which produced it, an effect which does not ordinarily follow and cannot be
reasonably anticipated from the use of those means, an effect which
the actor did not intend to produce and which he cannot be charged
with the design of producing under the maxim to' which we have
adverted, is produed by accidental means. It is produced by means
which were neither designed nor calculated to cause it. Such an
effect is not the result of design, cannot be reasonably anticipated, is
unexpected, and is produced by an unusual combination of fortuitous
circumstances; in other words, it is produced by accidental means."
The principle thus formulated has been accepted in many of the
decisions cited in footnote 1, supra.
