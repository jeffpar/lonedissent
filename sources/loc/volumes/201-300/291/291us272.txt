UNITED STATES v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.,
ADMINISTRATOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No..224.

Argued January 11, 12, 1934.-Decided February 5, 1934.

1. In determining the value of a devise to charities of a remainder
contingent upon the death without issue of a female life tenant
in order that such value may be deducted from gross income
in computing the federal estate tax, it is permissible to prove that
before the death of the testator the life tenant became incapable of
having issue, as the result of a surgical operation by which her
procreative organs were removed. P. 281.
2. The ancient rule that a woman is conclusively presumed to be
capable of bearing children as long as she lives, was, like other irrebuttable presumptions, a rule of expediency or policy, based upon
the belief that to permit proof of the facts would result in injuries
of greater consequence than the predominance of truth over error
in the cases to which it applied. P. 281.
3. Applicability of this presumption remains a proper subject of
judicial inquiry in the light of modern knowledge and experience.
Pp. 282, 285.
4. Application of a conclusive presumption of possibility of issue in
the present case would be subversive of the policy of th estate tax
statute to encourage bequests to charitable organizations. P. 286.

272

Argument for the United States.

Solicitor General Biggs, with whom Assistant Attorney
General Wideman and Mr. Paul A. Sweeney were on the
brief, for the United States.
The amount subject to tax is to be ascertained as of
the date of the decedent's death. Ithaca Trust Co. v.
United States, 279 U.S. 151. No deduction will be allowed
for a charitable bequest dependent upon a condition unfulfilled at that date. Humes v. United States, 276 U.S.
487; Regulations 37, Art. 56.
By the overwhelming weight of authority in the United
States, evidence is not admissible to show that a woman,
after reaching adult age, is incapable of bearing children.
Whether the courts use the words "conclusive presumption of law," "presumption of law," or some other expression, the result is the same, the rule being one of
substantive law rather than one governing the burden of
proof or the duty of going forward with evidence.
The following cases involved the rule against perpetuities, holding that remoteness could not be avoided by
allegation, agreement or proof that a woman was, by
reason of age, incapable of bearing children: White v.
Allen, 76 Conn. 185; Taylor v. Crosson, 11 Del. Ch. 145;
Reasoner v. Herman, 191 Ind. 642; Beall v. Wilson, 146
Ky. 646; Brown v. Columbia Finance & Trust Co., 123

The following involved determination of title and
the right to distribution or partition under wills and
deeds. Presumption in favor of child-bearing capacity
held conclusive: Bowen v. Frank, 179 Ark. 1004; Williams v. Frierson, 150 Ga, 797; Dustin v. Brown,, 297 Ill.

In the following cases it has been held that the presumption in favor of issue made it impossible for a
vendor to convey clear title, and specific performance was
denied: Weberpals v. Jenny, 300 Ill. 145; Aulick v. Summers, 186 Ky. 810; Azarch v. Smith, 222 Ky. 566; Brown

Argument for the United States.

In the following cases the presumption was discussea
in connection with the determination of the intent of a
testator: Ansonia Nat. Bank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744;
Oleson v. Somogyi, 93 N.J.Eq. 506; Flora v. Anderson, 67
Fed. 182.
The presumption was also discussed in Sims v. Birden,
197 Ala. 690; State v. Lash, 16 N.J.Eq. 380.
See also 48 L.R.A. (N.S.) 865; 67 A.L.R. 538; 23 Col.L.
Rev. 50.
In England the same rule has been strictly enforced in
cases involving the rule against perpetuities (Jee v.
Audley, 1 Cox Ch. Cas. 324; Griffiths v. Deloitte, [1926]
Ch. 56), but in distributing estates the courts have been
more liberal when the proof of incapacity seemed persuasive and distribution would deprive no living person,
of a possible interest. In re White, [1901] 1 Ch. 57( ;
Carr v. Carr, 106 L.T.Rep. 753. Cf. Perkin v. Bland, 1 2
L.T.Rep. 181.
With relatively few exceptions, the courts have regarded the principle as so firmly established that departures from precedent should be prohibited, if only for the
sake of certainty and uniformity. See In re Dougan, 139
Ga. 351, 355.
The cases holding that evidence can be admitted to
show that a woman is in fact incapable of having issue
are few. Johnson v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana 70, has not
been followed in Kentucky. See May v. Bank of Hardinsburg, 150 Ky. 136. Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33;
Riley v. Riley, 92 N.J.Eq. 465; Gowen's Appeal, 106 Pa.
288; List v. Rodney, 83 Pa. 483; Sterrett's Estate, 300 Pa.

App.D.C. 496, were cases involving specific performance
of contracts for the sale of real estate. It can be inferred
in all of them that the courts concluded that the possibil-

291 U.S.

ity of issue being born to a woman long past the age
for child-bearing was too remote to render unmarketable
the title offered by the vendor.
There are two cases in which the capacity of a woman
to bear children has arisen in connection with tax matters-Farringtonv. Commissione 30 F. (2d) 915, cert.
den., 279 U.S. 873; and Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550, now pending on appeal to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Both
involved the federal estate tax, and in both the presumption of capacity was held to be conclusive and irrebuttable. See also Pennsylvania Co. v. Brown, E.D.Penna.,
decided July .18, 1933, reported in Prentice-Hall Federal
Tax Service, 1933, Vol. 1A, par. 1761.
The reasons usually given for excluding evidence of the
incapacity of a woman to bear children are: (1) that the
age at which ability to procreate ceases can not be ascertained with any degree of certainty; (2) that the subject
is one of such delicacy that it should not be investigated in
judicial proceedings; (3) that consideration of such evidence might encourage the performance of surgical operations to prevent birth of issue; and (4) that the prevailing
rule tends to eliminate confusion in titles to property.
See Hill v. Sangamon Loan & Trust Co., 295 Ill. 619,
621-622.
It happens that the great majority of the cases wherein
the presumption has been held conclusive involved only
old age or the physiological changes incident thereto, but
the rule makes no distinction between incapacity due to
age and incapacity due to artificial causes. In two cases
testimony has been offered to show that the capacity to
bear children had been terminated by medical treatment.
Both involved the same surgical operation as was proved
here (hysterectomy), and in both the evidence was held
inadmissible. Byers v. Beddow, 106 Fla. 166; Guaranty
Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.
272

Argument for Respondent.

Courts may well be reluctant to permit inquiry into
matters so steeped in unceltainty as the efficacy of the
various methods used to destroy child-bearing capacity.
The rule which has survived for many years should not
be discarded upon a showing of hardship in. individual.
cases.
Mr,Joseph Carson, with whom Mr. George M. Morris
was oh the brief, for respondent.
Modern medical knowledge and scientific certainty
have made the rule contended for by the United States
obsolete and inapplicable in this case.
No legal writer :before Littleton refers to the rule.
Littleton's Tenures (1592 ed.), fol. 8; Coke on Littleton,
28; 2 Blackstone's Commentaries, 125. The comments
of these writers are made in connection with estates
tail for the purpose of showing that a fee tail gtneral can
not become a fee tail with possibility of issue extinct and
that a fee tail special arises only upon the death of one
of the spouses. They appear to be the product of
logicians in tenure and have an extremely remote, if any,
connection with a federal estate tax dispute arising under
modern American statutes. Cf. United States v. Provident Trust Co., 281 U.S. 497.
In the then state of medicine and surgery, it was impossible to determine as a fact that either the male or
female was incapable of procreation,-hence the rule.
The modernity of medical knowledge is emphasized by
the fact that of all the cases cited involving incapacity of
a woman to bear children, it appears that only three involved surgical operations. Byers v. Beddow, 106 Fla.
166; Guaranty Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 27 B.T.A. 550;
and the present case. The absence of such cases makes
it evident that the chief practical difficulty in the cases
which have heretofore come before the courts has been
the inconclusiveness of the evidence offered.

278

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Respondent.

291 U.S.

That the rule has rested on ignorance and uncertainty
and not on knowledge, will best be demonstrated by reading the cases cited by petitioner. In every case the character of the evidence tending to show incapacity appears
-to have been considered, and the 'judgments of the courts
will be seen in large measure to have been formed from
the facts appearing in the evidence offered. Uncertain
as to the impossibility of issue from the evidence presented, the courts have fallen back on the ancient formula
as a safer guide. See Hill v. Sangamon Loan & Trust Co.,
295 Ill. 619; Bowlin v. R.I. Hospital Trust Co., 31 R.I.
289.
Nevertheless courts in the United States have frequently recognized incapacity to bear children where the
evidence was less conclusive than here. Whitney v. Groo,
40 App.D.C. 496; Johnson v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana 70;
Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33; Gowen's Appeal, 106
Pa. 288; Bacot v. Fessenden, 130 App. Div. 819; Ansonia
National Bank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744. See also Apgar
v. Apgar, 38 N.J.Eq. 549; In re Staheli, 78 N.J.Eq. 74, 77.
And the British courts have, except where the property
interests of living persons would be adversely affected,
regularly admitted such evidence. Mackenzie v. King,
17 L.J. Ch. N.S. 488 (1848); In re White, 1 Ch. 570
(1901); Leng v. Hodges, Jac. 585 (1822); Edwards v.
Tuck, 3 De G. M. & G. 39 (1853); Brown v. Pringle, 4
Hare 124 (1845); Haynes v. Haynes, 35 L.J. Ch. 303
(1866). Moreover, in the field of law pertaining to damages for personal injury, it appears to be the universal
rule that evidence will be received to show that the injury destroyed the power to have issue. This Court has
in fact so held. Denver & R. G. Ry. v. Harris, 122 'U.S.
597. See also Normile v. Wheeling T. Co., 57 W.Va. 132;
Sedgwick on Damages, 9th ed., vol. 1, § 41a; Partridgev.
Boston & M. R. Co., 184 Fed. 211; Alabama G. S. R. Co. v.
Hill, 93 Ala. 514.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.

279

Opinioii of the Court.

272

Petitioner relies upon a presumption, the product of the
artificial reasoning necessary to round out an intricate
medieval concept. With the appearance of modem abdominal surgery the ancient presumption has become a
demonstrable fiction-a bar to the truth-to be continued
only if overwhelmingly desirable in the public interest.
No such desirability exists here.
None of the reasons underlying the frequent refusal of
the courts to hold that a woman is incapable of bearing
children are applicable here.
Without the evidence as to incapacity the true value of
the estate for tax purposes can not be computed.
The wisdom, as a matter of public policy, of admitting
evidence concerning the impossibility of issue, is not involved where the question to which the evidence goes is
one of valuation by a party (the Government) not directly
concerned with anything more than the size of the testa,tor's estate under the statute. It was the province of the
court to pass upon the weight of all evidence pertinent
to value.
It is the purpose of the statute to encourage charitable
bequests (Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U.S. 61), and to require no more certainty in the evidence of value than is
generally found in "human affairs" (Ithaca Trust Co. v.
United States, 279 U.S. 151).
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Provident Trust Company is the administrator,
with will annexed, of the estate of the deceased, who died
in 1921, leaving a will thereafter duly admitted to probate. Subsequent to the filing of the federal estate tax
return, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue imposed
an additional estate tax, amounting with interest to something over $21,000. The trust company paid the amount
and filed a claim for refund of $18,404.05, on the ground

280

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

that under the provisions of the will the value of the
residuary estate, less the value of the life estate of the
daughter of deceased, should have been but was not
allowed as a deduction from the gross estate. The
commissioner rejected the claim and this action was
brought.
The will, after making certain bequests, devised the remainder of the estate to the trust company, in trust to
pay the income thereof to deceased's daughter during hei
natural life, and upon her death to her lawful issue; and
further provided that upon the death of the daughter
without issue, the testator's residuary estate should be
distributed among designated charitable institutions and
societies-all belonging to that class of organizations, bequests to which are deductible from the gross estate under
the provisions of § 403 (a) (3) of the Revenue Act of
1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1057, 1098. At the time of deceased's
death, the daughter was fifty years of age. She had been
in poor health and under a physician's care; and on February 9, 1914, upon medical advice, an operation was
performed removing her uterus, Fallopian tubes, and both
ovaries. The court below specifically found-" The operation and removal of the organs were necessary to prevent further impairment of her health. After the operation she could not have become pregnant nor could she
have given birth to a child. She died on March 12, 1927,
unmarried, and without ever having given birth to a
child." Following her death, a state orphans' court
awarded the residue of the estate, subject to payment of
transfer or inheritance taxes which might be due, to the
charitable organizations named in the will.
Upon the foregoing facts, the court below held that respondent was entitled' to recover, and accordingly awarded
judgment in the sum of $17,204.66. 77 Ct. Cls. 37;
2 F.Supp. 472.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.
272

Opinion of the Court.

Section 403 (aL) (3), supra, so far as it is pertinent here,
provides that for the purpose of determining the value of
the net estate to be taxed there shall be deducted from the
value of the gross estate-" (3) The amount of all bequests, . . . to or for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes .....
" Article
.53, Treasury Regulations 37, declares that the amount of
the -deduction in such case is the value at the date of
decedent's death of the remainder interest in the money or
property which is devised or bequeathed to charity. Com-,
pare Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151. It
follows that in making a deduction for that interest, the
value thereof must be determined from data available at
the time of the death of decedent. Compare Humes v.
United States, 276 U.S. 487, 494.
The government contended in the court below, as it
contends here, that, in view of the restriction in respect
of issue contained in the will, the value could not be thus
determined, since the law, without regard to the fact, conclusively presumes that a woman is capable of bearing
children as long as she lives; and that this presumption
controls where the organs of reproduction have been completely removed and inability to bear children admits of
no valid dispute, no less than where the question turns
upon the circumstance of age alone, or upon conflicting
evidence or medical opinions. The lower court held
otherwise for the reason that the facts established, as of
the (late of decedent's death, forbade any other conclusion than that the daughter was incapable of bearing children, and a presumption to the contrary could not be
indulged.
The rule in respect of irrebuttable presumptions rests
upon grounds of expediency or policy so compelling in
character as to override the generally fundamental re-

291 U.S.

quirement of our system of law that questiOfr of fact must
be resolved according to the proof. Mr. Best, writing
more than ninety years ago when the force of th cle was.
more strictly regarded than it has come to be since, said
that modern courts of justice (that is to say, the courts of
that day) were slow to recognize presumptions as irrebuttable, and were disposed to restrict rather than extend
the number.
"Many presumptions," he says, "which, in earlier
times, were deemed absolute and irrebuttable, have, by
the opinion of later judges, acting on more enlarged experience, either been ranged among praesumptionesjuris
tantism, or considered as presumptions of fact, to be made
at the discretion of a jury. . . . By an arbitrary rule, to
preclude a party from adducing evidence which, if received, would compel a decision in his favour, is an act
which can only be justified by the clearest expediency and
soundest policy; and it must be confessed that there are
several presumptions still retained in this class which
never ought to have found their way into it, and which, it
is to be feared, often operate seriously to the defeat of
justice." Best, Presumptions of Law and Fact (London,
1844), § 18.
Certainly the world has gained in experience since that
was written; and the binding effect, in respect of particular situations, of the ancient rule precluding proof of facts
to the end of avoiding supposed injurious results thought
to be of greater consequence than the predominance of
truth over error, still remains a proper subject of judicial
inquiry to be made and resolved in the light of such further experience and knowledge. Compare Funk v. United
States, 290 U.S. 371.
The foregoing observations are peculiarly apposite to
the phase of the subject now under review; for, as suggested by counsel for respondent, the presumption here

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.
272

Opinion of the Court.

involved had its origin at a time when medical knowledge\
was meager, and many centuries before -the discovery of
anaesthetics and, consequently, before surgical operations
of the kind here involved became practicable. It was not
until a comparatively recent period, therefore, that the
effect of such an operation was disclosed to observation,
and the incontrovertible fact recognized that a woman
subjected thereto was permanently incapable of bearing
children.
The government argues that the rule is one of substantive law and evidence to overcome it is inadmissible.
Whether in particular instances so-called irrebuttable presumptions are, in a more accurate sense, rules of substantive law rather than crue presumptions, is a matter in
respect of which a good deal has been said by modern
commentators on the law of evidence. 2 Chamberlayne
on Evidence, §§ 1086, 1087, 1159, et seq.; 5 Wigmore on
Evidence, 2d ed., § 2492. Compare Heiner v. Donnan,
285 U.S. 312, 328-329; 2 Thayer, Evidence, 351-352, 540541, 545-546. But it is unnecessary to consider that interesting distinction, since, as will appear, the presumption in
questioii in this instance must be dealt with as open to
rebuttal and, therefore, in any aspect of the matter, as a
true presumption.
The presumption generally has been held to be conclusive when the element of age alone is involved, albeit
Lord Coke's view that the law seeth no impossibility of
issue, even though both husband and wife be an hundred
years old (Coke on Littleton, 551; 2 Blackstone Commentaries 125), if now asserted for the first time, might
well be put aside as a rhetorical extravagance. But the
presumption, even where age alone is involved, has not
been universally upheld as conclusive or applied under
all circumstances. It has been followed to a greater extent in this country than in England, though even here

exceptional cases are to be found; 1 and in England su(
cases are very numerous.' It does not seem necessai
to review the decisions in either jurisdiction. It is enougi
to say that the English courts have treated the rule ,-;
possessing a considerable degree of flexibility and have
refused to give it a conclusive effect in a large number of
cases; while the American courts, adhering to a more rigid
view, have applied the rule more generally. See extended
note, 67 A.L.R. 538, et seq., where the decisions are classified and digested. Few cases have arisen where elements
other than, or in addition to, that-of age were present, and
the conclusive character of the rule in such cases is by no
means established. Thus in Hill v. Spencer, 196 Ill. 65,
70; 63 N.E. 614, the Supreme Court of Illinois held meaningless an allegation that a woman was past the age of
childbearing, but was careful to add, " unless more than
a mere matter of age is stated in the bill." See Denver
& R. G. Ry. v. Harris,supra, note 1. And speaking generally this court has said, Lincoln v. French, 105 U.S. 614,
616-617-" But all presumptions as to matters of fact,
capable of ocular or tangible proof, such as the execution
of a deed, are in their nature disputable. No conclusive
character attaches to them.. They may always be rebutted
and overthrown."
The basis for the interposition of an irrebuttable presumption is embodied in the general statement of Mr.
'Male v. Williams, 48 N.J.Eq. 33, 36; 21 At. 854; Ansonia National
Bank v. Kunkel, 105 Conn. 744, 753; 136 Ati. 588; Moore's Executor
v. Beauchamp, 5 Dana (Ky.) 70, 72; Bacot's Case, MS. (N.J.), cited
in note to Apgar's Case, 37 N.J.Eq. 502; Apgar v. Apgar, 38 N.J.Eq.
549, 552; Carney v. Kain, 40 W.Va. 758, 811; 23 S.E. 650. And in
Denver & R. G. Ry. v. Harris, 122 U.S. 597, 608, a personal injury
case, this court sustained without question the admission of evidence
that the injured person had been rendered impotent as a result of the
physical injury.

'See note to Apgar's Case, supra, note 1.

U.S. v. PROVIDENT TRUST CO.
272

Opinion of the Court.

Wigmore, quoted by the court below, that evidence of
certain kinds of facts is excluded "because its admission
would injure some other cause more than it would help
the cause of truth, and because the avoidance of that injury is considered of more consequence than the possible
harm to the cause of truth." 1 Wigmore on Evidence, 2d
ed., § 11. Relating this obviously correct view to the
presumption here invoked, not only do we perceive no
grounds of expediency or policy that call for its hard and
fast application to a particular physical condition, when
ignorance has been supplanted by knowledge so as to put
beyond the range of doubt the destructive effect of that
condition upon the capacity for childbearing, but we
conclude affirmatively that the policy of the statute under
review as applied to the case in hand is quite to the
contrary.
The important point to be emphasized is that the question arises with respect to a surgical operation, the inevitably destructive effect of which upon the power of
procreation is established by tangible and irrefutable
proof. Moreover, the case does not involve the rule
against perpetuities, the devolution of property, the rights
or title of living persons in or to property, or any other
situation such as constituted the background of practically all the decisions which have suitained the conclusiveness of the presumption. We have'for consideration
simply a statutory provision exempting from a prescribed
tax the value of all bequests, etc., made to or for the use
of charitable organizations and those which are akin,
plainly evincing a legislative policy to encourage such bequests. Edwards v. Slocum, 264 U.S. 61, 63. And, in
that view, we well may assume that Congress could not
have meant to leave its aim to be diverted by a purely
arbitrary presumption, which, whether applicable or not
to sustain another or different policy, would deny the

truth and subvert the policy of this particular legislation.
Compare Huprcs v. United States, supra, at p. 494.
The sole question to be considered is-What is the
value of the interest to be saved from the tax? That is
a practical question, not concluded by the presumption
invoked but to be determined by ascertaining in terms of
money what the property constituting that interest would
bring in the market, subject to such uncertainty as ordinarily attaches to such an inquiry. See Ithaca Trust Co.
v. United States, supra. Thus stated, the birth of a child
to the daughter of the deceased after his death was so
plainly impossible that, as a practical matter, the hazard
disappears from the problem. Certainly, in the light of
our present accurate knowledge in respect of the subject,
if the interest had been offered for sale in the open market
during the daughter's lifetime, a suggestion of the possibility of such an event would have been ignored by every
intelligent bidder as utterly destitute of reason.
