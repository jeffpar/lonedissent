MANHATTAN PROPERTIES, INC. v. IRVING
TRUST CO., TRUSTEE IN BANKRUPTCY.*
CERTIORARI

No. 505.

TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
SECOND CIRCUIT.

FOR THE

Argued January 10, 1934.-Decided February 5, 1934.

1. The claim of a landlord for future rents based on a covenant to
p'ay rent in a lease terminated by reintry on the bankruptcy of the
tenant, is not a provable debt under ยง 63 (a) of the Bankruptcy
Act. P. 332.
So held in view of the great weight of judicial authority construing that section and similar provisions of earlier Acts, and in
view of the legislative history of the subject.
2. The fact that a provision of a statute which has received a settled
construction from federal courts has remained unaltered notwithstanding that Congr6ss has repeatedly amended the statute inother
respects, is persuasive that the construction accords with the legislative intention. P. 336.
3. Sections 73-76, added to the Bankruptcy Act by the Act of
March 3, 1933, were enacted to permit extensions and compositions
not theretofore possible, for individuals only; and the clause of
ยง 74 (a) providing that "A claim for future rent shall constitute a
proval le debt and shall be liquidated under ยง 63 (b) of this Act,"
is to be related to this novel procedure and not taken as an amendment of ยง 63 (a) or as declaratory of its meaning. P. 336.
4. A covenant by a tenant to indemnify the landlord for loss of rent
he may suffer during the residue of the term after reintry by the

landlord upon the bankruptcy of the tenant, and which can come
into operation only after the bankruptcy, and only if the landlord
sees fit to regnter on that ground, is not a basis for a debt provable
in the bankruptcy proceedings. P. 338.
5. Such a covenant is not the equivalent of an agreement that bankruptcy shall be a breach of the lease and that the consequent damages to the lessor shall be measured by the difference between the
present value of the remainder of the term and the total rent to
fall due in the future. P. 338.

the rejection of claims for loss of future rents, in two
bankruptcy cases.
Mr. William D. Mitchell, with whom Messrs. C. Dickerman Williams, Rollin Browne, Ralph Montgomery
Arkush, and Amos J. Peaslee were on the brief, for petitioners.
The lower courts have become involved in a maze of
technicalities and distinctions based on ancient maxims
of the law of landlord and tenant and developed by indemnity clauses, reentry clauses, ipso facto clauses, acceleration clauses, liquidated damage clauses, and a variety
of other covenants contained in modern leases. They
have to a large extent lost sight of fundamentals and of
the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act, and of the fact that
Congress may have intended that such claims should be
allowed, the tenant discharged from liability for future
rents, and the landlord allowed to share with other creditors in the distribution of assets.
The correct rule is to be found in the Bankruptcy Act
and in the decisions of this Court. Williams v. U.S.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Petitioners.

291 U.S.

To deny provability of such claims defeats the purposes
of the Act. It leaves the bankrupt liable indefinitely,
while denying the landlord the right to participate with
other contract creditors.
If the tenant be a corporation, it rarely is rehabilitated
after bankruptcy; and if the claim be not allowed in bankruptcy, the landlord is left to pursue the empty husk of a
corporation without assets. For all practical purposes
his claim is discharged. It is true he may resume possession, but the value of what he resumes is depreciated
below the rent contracted, otherwise he would have no
claim. The persons interested in the corporation may
organize a new one to take over the assets at bankruptcy
sale at a price which will satisfy other creditors or pay
them in full, and then continue the business and leave
the landlord to pursue a defunct corporation, with only
the possibility of mitigating his loss by renting the property for less than the original lease provided. How this
system works is well stated in an article on "Rent Claims
in Bankruptcy," 33 Col.L.Rev. 213. See 7 Univ.Cin.L.
Rev. 162.
Claims have been allowed on instalment contracts to
buy ice (In re Stern, 116 Fed. 604); contracts to buy cotton bagging (Lesser v. Gray, 236 U.S. 70); instalment
contracts to sell rubber (In re Portage Rubber Co., 296
Fed. 289); contracts to buy stock (In re Pettingill & Co.,
137 Fed. 143); employment contracts (Re Schultz &
Guthrie, 235 Fed. 907); annuities (Cobb v. Overman, 109
Fed. 65); and on contracts t o make monthly payments
similar to rents for the privilege of handling baggage at a
hotel (Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Assn.,
240 U.S. 581).
There should be no distinction between leases having
special indemnity or ipso facto covenants and those which
have not.

MANHATTAN PROP. v. IRVING TR. CO. 323
320

Argument for Petitioners.

The special covenants have been relied on to remove
the element of contingency, to endeavor to make claims
absolute at the time of the filing of the petition, and also
to avoid the objection that a covenant to pay rent is
extinguished by the landlord's resumption of possession.
On the latter theory, these special covenants have been
said to substitute for the covenant to pay rent a personal
covenant of indemnity, the liability to perform which is
not extinguished as is the rent obligation by reintry.
There is supFort for this theory in Gardinerv. Butler, 245
U.S. 603, and in other decisions.
The resumption of possession is not the voluntary act of
the landlord; it is forced upon him by the bankruptcy.
For the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act the argument that
the obligation to pay rent no longer forms a basis for
awarding damage because the consideration for rent is the
possession of the land, is no more forcible than the argument that the obligation of the bankrupt to pay for goods
on future delivery is extinguished because the goods will
not be delivered to an insolvent purchaser.
The argument that reentry cancels the covenant to pay
rent,. the only covenant on which a claim could be based,
unless there is a special indemnity covenant, ignores the
fundamental purpose of the Bankruptcy Act as announced in Williams v. U.S. Fidelity & G. Co., and Maynard v. Elliott, supra. Cf. Central Trust Co. v. Chicago
Auditorium Assn., 240 U.S. 581.
On the narrower view as to the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, the claims involved in these cases are provable
because of the special indemnity covenants. In both
leases the parties expressly contracted for personal liability of the tenant to indemnify the landlord for loss of
rent consequent upon default or bankruptcy leading to
reentry and stipulated that resumption of possession of
the leased premises by the landlord would not discharge
that liability.

324

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Petitioners.

291 U.S.

The lease in No. 506 contains an indemnity clause in
substantially the form involved in the Filene case, except
that in the latter case the lease contained a liquidated
damage clause adopting the formula which is the ordinary
rule for computing the damage, and which is the rule
which may be adopted even where some other rule has
been contracted for. Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Assn., supra; Sweatman's Appeal, 150 Pa. St. 369.
The lease in No. 505 contains an indemnity clause in
which the tenant agreed to reimburse the landlord from
month to month. In so far as such a covenant contemplates a continued liability of the tenant after discharge
in bankruptcy, it could not be operative, but nevertheless
the covenants of that lease sufficiently reserve a claim
against the tenant notwithstanding reentry.
Although the covenants in both leases provide the same
formula in case of bankruptcy as is provided in case of
default without bankruptcy, if the provision for future
liability of the tenant after bankruptcy is discarded, there
still remains the covenant for indemnity in case of default, which satisfies the rule in the Filene case. The
result is that in both cases the covenant for indemnity
may form the basis of the claim as a substitute for the
covenant for rent, and the objection that has sometimes
been offered to the provability of such claims, that a
rent covenant is extinguished by reentry, disappears from
the case.
The agreement of the tenant to indemnify his landlord
is itself an existing contractual obligation susceptible of
present valuation. Williams v. U.S. Fidelity & G. Co.,
236 U.S. 540; In re Buzzini, 183 Fed. 827, cited with approval by this Court in Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U.S. 273.

based theoretically on the doctrine of anticipatory breach

to remove doubt as to the construction of the prior law,
and confirms our position.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Respondent.

291 U.S.

Mr. Frederick H. Wood, with whom Messrs. Harold L.
Fiermanand William D. Whitney were on the brief, for
respondent.
The legislative and judicial history of the Bankruptcy
Act is persuasive, if not conclusive, that Congress did not
intend that claims for damages for loss of future rent
should be provable in bankruptcy.
Moreover, only compelling language in the Act itselfwhich is wanting therefrom-would warrant the rejection
of the construction placed upon the Act by the courts below, which is a construction accepted and followed with
substantial unanimity by bench and bar practically ever
since the enactment of the statute.
The amendment of March 3, 1933, was not, as asserted
by petitioners, declaratory of the intent of the Act as
originally passed.
The long accepted interpretation of the Act upon which
the decisions below are based, is consistent with the decisions of this Court and is supported by well established
and long recognized principles of law.
With regard to the law of England, it is pertinent to observe that it took an Act of Parliament to abolish the distinction based upon: what petitioners concede to be "the
technical law of landlord and tenant" and the law governing contracts relating to personalty or to the performance
of personal services.
The "technical law of landlord and tenant" is to be
found in the rule that, while breaches of executory contracts relating to personalty and to the performance of
personal services give rise to claims for damages, the landlord by reentry terminates all liability of the tenant to
pay rent, and that upon such reentry and termination no
cause of action in favor of the landlord for the recovery
of damages for the consequent loss of future rent arises.

covenant to pay rent, followed by reentry and termination
by the landlord, would give rise to no cause of action in
favor of the landlord were the tenant solvent. Consequently, it gives rise to no claim where the breach of such
covenant is the result of bankruptcy. This being so, the
claim asserted is not even a contingent claim, since all
liability of the tenant, whatever the occasion for the default, is extinguished by reentry and termination of the
lease on the part of the landlord.
Distinguishing: Williams v. U.S. Fidelity & G. Co., 236
U.S. 549; Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U.S. 273; Kothe v.
R. C. Taylor Trust, 280 U.S. 224. Wm. Filene's Sons Co.
v. Weed, 245 U.S. 597, was in equity. The opinion intimates that the claim would not have been allowable in
bankruptcy. Cf. Gardinerv. Butler, supra.
The specific claims presented in these cases, arising
out of the particular covenants contained in the leases
before the Court, are in no event provable in bankruptcy.

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

MR. JusTIcE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.

These cases present the question whether a landlord
may prove in bankruptcy for loss of rents payable in the
future, where the claim is founded upon the bankrupt's
covenant to pay rent, and, in the alternative, upon his
breach of a covenant that in event of bankruptcy, the
landlord may re~nter, and if he does, the tenant will
indemnify him against loss of rents for the remainder
of the term.
In No. 505 it appears that Oliver A. Olson Co., Inc.,
was the lessee of premises for a term of nine years and
eight months beginning February 1, 1928, and expiring
October 1, 1937. Defaults in payment of rent due February and March, 1932, were followed by an involuntary
proceeding in which the company was, on March 18, 1932,
adjudicated a bankrupt. The total rent reserved for the
portion of the term subsequent to bankruptcy was
$58,000, and, as the claimant asserted, the present rental
value of the leased premises for the remainder of the
term was $33,000. The lessor filed its claim, one item
being damages for loss of future rentals, which it asked
to have liquidated at $2&,000, the difference between the
rent reserved and the present rental value.
The lease contained a covenant that if the tenant
should default in the payment of rent, or abandon the
premises, or if they should become vacant, the tenant become insolvent, or make an assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or if bankruptcy proceedings should be instituted by or against the tenant, the landlord might without notice reenter the premises; and after obtaining possession, relet as agent for the tenant, for the whole or any
part of the term, and from time to time, and:
"The Tenant further agrees to pay each month to the
Landlord the deficit accruing from the difference betweenthe amount to be paid as rent as herein reserved and the

MANHATTAN PROP. v. IRVING TR. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

amount of rent which shall be collected and received from
the demised premises for such month during the residue
of the term herein provided for after the taking possession
by the Landlord; the overplus, if any, at the expiration
of the full term herein provided for shall be paid to the
Tenant unless the Landlord within a period of six months
from the termination of this lease as provided herein shall,
by a notice in writing,, release the Tenant from any and
all liability created by this provision of the lease, which
it is agreed the Landlord shall, at the Landlord's option,
have the right to do, in which event it is agreed that the
Landlord and the Tenant shall have no further rights and
liabilities hereunder."
The peferee expunged so much of the claim as sought
damages for loss of future rents, holding that it did not
constitute a provable debt. The District Court and the
Circuit Court of Appeals were of the same opinion.1
In No. 506 premises owned by the petitioners were held
by the bankrupt under a lease dated June 14, 1920, for a
term to expire June 30, 1945. There was a covenant that
on default by the lessee, or if it should be adjudicated
a bankrupt, the lessor might enter and repossess the
premises,
and upon entry as aforesaid this lease shall determine, and the Lessee covenants that in case of such
termination it will indemnify the Lessor against all loss
of rent which the Lessor may incur by reason of such
termination, during the residue of the term above
specified."
A voluntary petition was filed and an adjudication
entered August 29, 1932. November 23, 1932, the trustee
disaffirmed the lease, and three days later the lessors took
possession and proceeded to collect rents from the occupants of the demised premises; and January 13, 1933,

they filed a proof of claim which as amended included an
item of $4,404.40, representing the difference between
the rent accrued to the date of reentry and the collections
from occupants during that period, and an item of $143,615.80, representing the -difference between the alleged
rental value for the remainder of the term after reentry
and the rent reserved in the lease. Petitioners made application for liquidation of their claim under ยง 63 (b) of
the Bankruptcy Act. The trustee moved to have the
claim expunged and disallowed. The referee disallowed
both items, and his action was affirmed by the District
Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals.2
The controversy hinges upon the interpretation of the
following sections of the Bankruptcy Act:
"Sec. 63. Debts which may be proved. (a) Debts of
the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his
estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a
judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing
at the time of the filing of. the petition against him,
whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon
which would have been recoverable at that date or with
a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable
and did not bear interest; ... (4) founded upon an open
account, or upon a contract express or implied; . . .
"(b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may,
pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such
manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved
and allowed against his estate."

331

Opinion of the Coirt.

A majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals felt bound
to follow its earlier decision in Re Roth & Appel, 181 Fed.
667, which denied a landlord's right to prove a claim for
future rents arising under a similar lease. The view there
expressed was that the occupation of the land is the consideration for the rent, and if the right to occupy terminates, the obligation to pay ceases; and the covenant to
pay rent creates no debt until the time stipulated for
payment arrives. Since many events may occur which
will absolve the tenant from further obligation for rent,
the claim is said to be too contingent, both because of the
uncertainty at the date of adjudication that the lessor will
reenter, and the doubt as to his suffering loss of rent if
-he should reenter.
In the present case one of the judges of the Court of
Appeals held that Maynard v. Elliott, 283 U.S. 273, has
settled the provability of claims contingent in the sense
that no sum is presently payable, thus destroying the
principal ground of decision in Re Roth & Appel, and that
the estimation of the present worth of payments to be
made in the future is no obstacle to the proof of a claim
based upon an anticipatory breach. Central Trust Co. v.
Chicago Auditorium Assn., 240 U.S. 581.
The petitioners say the provability of claims for future
rent is a subject on which the lower federal courts have
been in disagreement. They argue that a claim, for rent
is founded upon a lease which is an express contract
within the words of ยง 63 (a) (4). They rely upon the
purpose of the bankruptcy law to bring in all contract
creditors and to discharge all debts of the bankrupt, so that
he may start afresh unembarrassed by old indebtedness,
and point to the hardship to an individual bankrupt of
not discharging claims for rent which might well prevent
his financial rehabilitation, and the unfairness to the landlord of a corporate bankrupt who, under the decision below, cannot prove upon his lease along with other cred-

itors, but must look solely for redress for loss of future
rents to a corporate debtor whom bankruptcy has stripped
of all assets.
The respondent asserts a substantial difference between
rent and other kinds of indebtedness, and presents equitable considerations thought to weigh in its favor, but
especially stresses the legislative history of the bankruptcy
laws passed by Congress, and insists that the preponderant
construction of them by the courts excludes claims for
future rents from the class of provable debts.
The issue is not one of power, for plainly Congress may
permit such claims or exclude them. The sole inquiry
is the intent of the Act. The construction for which the
petitioners contend is, as a matter of logic, an admissible
one. But that construction is contrary to the great weight
of authority as to the effect of similar provisions in earlier
Acts, and ยง 63 of the present Act.
In England such claims were not provable under the
Act of 7 Geo. I, c. 31; Mayor v. Steward, 4 Burr. 2439;
and a discharge could not be pleaded in defense of an
action for rent accruing subsequent to bankruptcy.
Boot v. Wilson, 8 East 311. The landlord's claim for loss
of future rent was made provable by the Act of 32 and
33 Vict., c. 71, ยง 23 (1869), and more explicit provisions
to the same effect were embodied in that of 46 and 47
Vict., c. 52, ยงยง 37 and 55 (1883).
The Act of Congress, approved April 4, 1800,' permitted
proof of a limited class of contingent claims, but did not
mention rents. Apparently the latter were not considered provable debts under that statute. Hendricks v.
'2 Stat. 19, Sec. 39. ". . . the obligee of any bottomry or respondentia bond, and the assured in any policy of insurance, shall be admitted to claim, and after the contingency or loss, to prove the debt
thereon, in like manner as if the same had happened before issuing
the commission; and the bankrupt shall be discharged from such securities, as if such money had been due and payable before the time
of his or her becoming bankrupt . .

held that claims for future rent or for damages for breach
of covenant.to pay rent were not provable under the act,
though differing as to the reason; some holding them
not contingent claims within the statutory definition, and
others thinking the express permission of proof for rent
past due at the date of bankruptcy impliedly excluded
claims for rents thereafter falling due. Ex parte Houghton, Fed. Cas. 6725; Ex parte Lake, Fed. Cas. 7991; In re.

In the year 1880 Circuit Judge John Lowell, of Massachusetts, at the suggestion of several mercantile associations, drafted a proposed bankruptcy law, which, after
revision, was introduced in Congress, but failed of passage. It contained a section (60) which allowed proof
of damages suffered by a landlord by reason of the trustee's rejection of a lease, and another (61) permitting any
creditor to compel the trustee to elect to accept or decline
any lease, and upon declination the landlord was to have
"any damages he shall suffer thereby assessed, as the court

Schall v. Camors, 251 U.S. 239, 250), Congress adopted
the Act now in force, that of July 1, 1898."0 The committee reports do not disclose the origin of the phraseology of ยง 63, nor discuss the, classes of claims intended
to be included. But it is clear that Congress was familiar
with analogous sections of the earlier Acts and the court
decisions interpreting them, and with the text of the

Lowell Bill and the English act then in force. In view of
the extended consideration and discussion which preceded
the passage of the Act, the failure to include a provision
for claims for loss of rent or for damages consequent on
the abrogation of leases, is significant of an intent not
to depart from the precedents disallowing them. Schall
v. Camors, supra,pp. 250, 251.
Soon after the passage of the Act several federal courts!
were called upon to decide the question, and they uniformly held such claims were not provable debts under
ยง 63. In re Ells, 98 Fed. 967; In re Mahlcr, 105 Fed.
428; Atkins v. Wilcox, 105 Fed. 595. Since 1900 the
Circuit Courts of Appeals in six circuits, and the District
Courts in another, have agreed with these early adjudications. Slocum v. Soliday, 183 Fed. 410; McDonnell v.
Woods, 298 Fed. 434 (C.C.A. 1); In re Roth & Appel,
supra; In re Mullings Clothing Co., 238 Fed. 58; In re

v., Cobb, 100 Fed. 270; In re Hook, 25 F. (2d) 498. The
decisions in the Third Circuit turn upon a special' form
of lease drawn to take advantage of a local statutory
provision, and while establishing a rule differing from
that elsewhere recognized, are not inconsistent with it.
See Wilson v. Pennsylvania Trust Co., 114 Fed. 742;
South Side Trust Co. v. Watson, 200 Fed. 50; In re H. M.
Lasker Co., 251 Fed. 53; Rosenblum v. Uber, 256 Fed.

not discussed the question at length, but at least one of
its decisions supports the view that a claim for loss of
future rentals may be proved. In re Chakos, 24 F. (2d)

This court has never had occasion to pass upon the
precise point. It has not, however, expressed disapproval
of the rulings of the great majority of the lower federal
courts, and has cited many of their decisions with apparent approbation. See Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium Association, 240 U.S. 581, 589-590; Win. Filene's
Sons Co. v. Weed, 245 U.S. 597; Gardinerv. Butler & Co.,

In accord with the well-nigh unanimous view of the
federal courts reiterated for over thirty years are statements of leading text writers. Collier, Bankruptcy, Vol.

What of the activities of the Congress while this body
of decisions interpreting ยง 63a was growing? From
1898 to 1932 the Bankruptcy Act was amended seven
times " without alteration of the section. This is persuasive that the construction adopted by the courts has
been acceptable to the legislative arm of the government.

In this situation "only compelling language in the statute itself would warrant the rejection of a construction so
long and so generally accepted." Maynard v. Elliott,

so declare.
The petitioners call attention to the last clause of ยง
74 (a), which is one of the sections, added to the Act
in 1933: " "A claim for future rent shall constitute a

provable debt and shall be liquidated under section 63 (b)
of this Act." Sections 73 to 76 inclusive were enacted
to permit extensions and compositions not theretofore possible. They apply only to individuals. It is
highly unlikely that if the quoted sentence had been intended as an amendment of ยง 63 (a) it would have been
placed in contextdealing only with the novel procedure
authorized by the new sections. Moreover, the discussion
-on the floor of the Senate relative to the insertion of the
sentence, indicates that it was not intended to alter ยง 63
(a) as it then stood. 13 The petitioners insist the clause
is declaratory of the law, as understood by the Congress;
but there is no evidence to support this view, and it is
inconsistent with the long standing contrary judicial
construction.
It remains to consider the effect of the indemnity covenants in the leases. These do not provide for liquidation
of damages (compare Wm.Filene's Sons Co. v. Weed,
supra), nor indeed for any right to damages for breach of
the covenant to pay rent.
In No. 505 the agreement is, in the event of reentry and
reletting by the landlord, to pay each month the deficit
accruing from the difference between the amount to be
paid as rent under the lease and the amount received by
the landlord from the premises throughout the residue of
the original term; and further, that the overplus, if any,
at the expiration of the term, shall be paid to the tenant,
unless the landlord, within six months from reentry, release the tenant from all liability under the covenant,
authorized to do, thus terminating
which the landlord 'is
all rights and liabilities under the agreement of lease.
In No. 506 the stipulation is that upon bankruptcy the
landlord may reenter and thereby terminate the lease, and

the lessee covenants that, in such case, "it will indemnify
the Lessor against all loss of rent which the Lessor may
incur by reason of such termination, during the residue
of the term . . ."
In both cases the lessor has the choice whether he will
terminate the lease. Neither the bankrupt nor the trustee has any such option, except as the trustee may be entitled by law to disclaim. And upon the exercise of the
option by the landlord, a new contract, distinct from that
involved in the original letting, becomes operative.
While there is some color for the claim that bankruptcy
is an anticipatory breach of the lease contract, entailing a
damage claim against the estate, this cannot be true as
respects these independent covenants of indemnity. For
here, the landlord does not rely upon the destruction of
his contract by th, bankruptcy; he initiates a new contract of indemnit v by the affirmative step of reentry.
And this new contract comes into being not by virtue of
the bankruptcy proceeding, but by force of the act of reentry, which must occur at a date subsequent to the filing
,of the petition. Obviously this contract of indemnity is
not breached by bankruptcy, and cannot be breached until
the duty of indemnifying the landlord arises. That obligation cannot be complete until the expiration of the original term. There can be no debt provable in bankruptcy
arising out of a contract which becomes effective only at
the claimant's option and after the inception of the proceedings, the fulfilment of which is contingent on what
may happen from month to month or up to the end of
the original term. Compare In re Ells, supra; Slocum v.
Soliday, supra; In re Roth & Appel, supra. Such a covenant is not, as petitioners contend, the equivalent of an
agreement that bankruptcy shall be a breach of the lease
and the consequent damages to the lessor be measured by
the difference between the present value of the remainder

office within the meaning of ยง 1 of Art. III of the Constitution,
and his compensation may not be diminished. P. 348.

provision for the appointment of a "successor"
can not be
construed as vacating the office. P. 351.
3. A diminution after an increase of compensation, even though not

with whom Mr. Carl Taylor was on the brief, for petitioners.

To resign an office is to give it up. To retire from active
service is something less. To retire from regular active
service is still further removed from resignation.

By re-

tiring, a federal judge does not retire from office or wholly
from active service, but in the words of the statute, only
"from regular active service."
