Syllabus.

'United States v. Unzeuta, 281 U.S. 13$,i affirmed the
exclusive jurisdiction of the United States over crimes
committed within a reservatiqn lying within Nebraska;
Jurisdiction hadbeen ceded by the State.
Surplus Trading.Co. v. Cook, 281 U.S. 647, ruled-that
land within Arkansas purchased by the United States for
military purposes with the State's consent was under their
exclusive jurisdiction. Private personal property therein
was declared not subject to taxation by the State.
The principle approved in those cases applies here. A
State can not legislate effectively concerning matters beyond her jurisdiction and within territory subject only to
control by the United States.
The judgment of the Supreme Court must be reversed.
The cause will be remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
Reversed.
TEXAS &, PACIFIC RAILWAY CO. v. POTTORFF,
RECEIVER.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 128.

Argued December 7, 1933.-Decided February 5, 1934.

1. A national bank has no power to pledge its assets to secure a
private deposit. P. 253.
2. Such pledges are neither customary nor necessary in the business
of such banks, and are inconsistent with provisions of the National
Banking Act designed to sccure uniform treatment of depositors
and ratable distribution of assets in case of disaster. Pp. 254-255.
3. The Acts of Congress authorizing national banks to give security
for deposits of specified publie funds, do not impart or imply
power to pledge assets to secure private deposits. P. 257.
4. rTe contention that since the relation of bank to depositor is that
of debtor and creditor, and since a national bank may borrow

money upon a pledge of assets, it may likewise pledge assets to
secure a private deposit,-is untenable. The difference between'
deposits and loans is fundamental and far-reaching. P. 259.
5. A national bank is not estopped to deny the legality of an ultra
vires pledge of assets by which it obtained deposits; still less is its
receiver when the bank has become insolvent. P. 260.
6. The fact that a general deposit was obtained by the bank on the
'faith of an ultra vires pledge of its assets does not create a constructive trust or confer upon the depositor a preference over other
creditors in the event of the bank's insolvency. P. 261.

CERTIORARI, 290 U.S. 609, to review the affirmance of
a decree dismissing a bill brought by the Railway against
the receiver of a national bank, and granting relief to the
receiver on a cross bill.

Mr. M. E. Clinton, with whom Messrs. Del W. Harrington and T. D. Gresham were on the brief, for petitioner.
The relationship between a bank and its depositors
often has been stated by this Court. N.Y. County Nat.
Bank v. Massey, 192 U.S. 145; Auten v. U.S. Nat. Bank,
174 U.S. 141, 142; Marine Bank v. Fulton County Bank,
2 Wall. 256.
While recognizing that the power to borrow money is
not expressly given, this Court nevertheless has upheld
pledges to secure such loans because a national bank has
the implied power "to incur liabilities in the regular
course of its business," Aldrich v. Chemical Nat. Bank, 176
U.S. 626, and because "it is not in terms prohibited by
the National Banking Act," Wyman v. Wallace, 201 U.S.
243. Since a deposit is a loan and a loan may be secured
by a pledge of assets, it follows that deposits may be so
secured. Morse, Banks and Banking, 6th ed., Vol. 1,
§ 63, p. 182; Paton's Digest of Banking Law, 1926,
Vol. 1, § 641.
Such implied power is clearly conferred by § 24 of the
Act. First Nat. Bank v. National Exchange Bank, 92

Argument for Petitioner.

U.S. 127. In that section, the word "necessary" does
not mean " indispensable." Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland,
4 Wheat. 316, 412, 413.
It should be presumed that Congress used the word
"necessary " in its liberal sense' and intended it to convey
the meaning ascribed to it in McCulloch v. Maryland,
supra. " Employing this definition and applying it to the
opinion in First Nat. Bank v. National Exchange Bank,
92 U.S. 122, we find that the power conferred upon national banks was two-fold: (1) " To-transact such a business as is specified," i.e., the business of "receiving deposits "; and (2) " all such incidental powers necessary,"
i.e., convenient, useful, or essential, " to carry it on," i.e.,
the business of procuring deposits, and securing them. It
should be observed that the implied power thus granted,
to use other language of Chief Justice Marshall, "is
placed among the powers . . ., not among the limitations
on those powers. Its terms purport to enlarge, not to
diminish the powers. It purports to be an additional
power, not a restriction on those already granted." 4
Wheat. 419, 420.
"Subject to law" means "subject to whatever law"
the legislative body might think fit to pass. Head v.
University, 19 Wall. 530.. But we find nothing in the
Act prohibiting national banks, while solvent, from pledging a part of their assets to procure or retain deposits.
The plain implication of § 52 is to the contrary.
If a bank be solvent, there can be no valid objection to
its giving in good faith a dollar security for a dollar
gained by deposit, for the bank at any time can fully discharge all of its obligations. Cf. Scott v. Armstrong, 146
U.S. 510; 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 341; Burrowes v. Nimocks,
35 F. (2d) 152.
There is no valid distinction between the giving of
security for a public and a private deposit. Schumaker

248

OCTOBER TERM, 1933.
Argument for Petitioner.

291 U.S.

The pledging of a bank's securities as protection for
a deposit for the purpose of saving bond premiums is a
reasonable exercise of the authority of a bank's vice presL-dent to procure such deposit and within the principle announced by this Court in First Nat. Bank v. National
Exchange Bank, 92 U.S. 122
What the bank did in the case at bar amouirced to a
compromise. By it the. bank would be able to keep the
railway company's account, whiich carried an average daily
deposit balance of approximately $50,000, and at the same
time save the bond premiums. This the bank clearly had
authority to do. It was "a reasonable incident to the
business of receiving deposits."
The National Bank Act does not require every act of a
national bank to "accord with national banking practices
and customs" before such act is legal. Those banks are
authorized-to exercise all incidental powers which are convenient or useful (if not prohibited) in carrying on the
business of banking, which includes the business of receiving deposits. A transaction, therefore, which comes
within this implied power is valid even when performed
for the first time by a national bank. And it is manifestly improper for the courts, as was done in this case, to
place a burden of proof upon the railway company greater
than the Act itself required. The facts raised a presumption in favor of the validity of the pledge under the rule
that corporations are presumed to contract within their
powers, and, in the absence of proof to the contrary, their
contracts are presumed to be valid when not foreign to the
purposes for which the corporation is created. Ohio &
M. R. Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U.S. 258; Union Pacific R. Co.
v. Chicago, R. I. & P R. Co., 163 U.S. 564. Moreover., the
pledge agreement being on its face valid, the receiver,
who asserts that it was ultra vires, had the burden of
proving its invalidity. Clews v. Jamieson, 182 U.S. 490.
The power to receive deposits is indispensable to the

Argument for Petitioner.

conduct of banking, and the practice of giving security
for deposits is a practice followed by many banks.
Grigsbyv. Peoples Bank,.158 Tenn. 193. Properly, therefore, it should be held that the means by which deposits
are to be secured, not being limited or restricted by statute, should be left to the discretion of the bank's officers
and directors who know best what is convenient. Whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to, or consequential upon those things which the legislature has authorized, ought not, unless expressly prohibited, to be held,
by judicial construction, to be ultra vires. Jacksonville,
3l. P. R. & N. Co. v. Hooper, 160 U.S. 514.
The receiver's powers are enumerated in .. 191 and
192 of the National Bank Act, and are not broad enough
to authorize the receiver to challenge the validity of the
pledge agreement. Even in the case of ultra vires contracts, no one but the sovereign or some one authorized
by statute is permitted to assert that a corporation's contract-is ultra vires. Jones v. N.Y. Guaranty & I. Co.,
101 U.S. 622; Sioux City Terminal Co. v. Trust Co., 173
U.S. 110; Thompson v. St. Nicholas Nat. Bank, 146 U.S.
251; Blair v. Chicago, 201 U.S. 451. The receiver " does
not in any sense represent the Government." Case v.
Terrell, 11 Wall. 199.
If the receiver, as a representative of the bank, can
question the validity of the pledge agreement, he must
first return or tender to the railway company its deposits
made in reliance upon that agreement, as the bank would
be required to do.
The creditors now represented by the receiver are those
whose deposits no doubt were made since the bonds were
pledged. Under these circumstances it is difficult to
understand how those creditors or their representative, the
receiver, acquired any special property interest in the
pledged bonds superior to that of the bank itself, and
especially so since the railway company thereafter de-

posited a total of $148,765.75 relying on the pledge agreement, of which sum more than $54,000 on deposit when
the bank failed would be distributed by the receiver to

those creditors upon delivery of the pledged bonds to
the railway company. But the receiver acquired no
greater right in the pledged bonds than the bank had.
Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U.S. 507; Fourth Street Nat. Bank
v. Yardley, 165 U.S. 653
The bank could not have disaffirmed the agreement
without returning the bonds. California Nat. Bank v.
Kennedy, 167 U.S. 362; Union Pacific Ry. v. Chicago,

Co. v. McCarthy, 96 U.S. 258; Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co.
v. Howard, 7 Wall. 392.
The pledge was known to the national bank examiners
and was therefore sanctioned by the Comptroller. See
Brown v. Schleier, 118 Fed. 981, aff'd, 194 U.S. 18.
When a solvent national bank induces a depositor to
cancel or surrender corporate surety bonds protecting its
deposits and to accept in lieu thereof other security
which the bank is without authority to furnish, moneys
thereafter deposited in reliance upon that security are
received by the bank as special deposits which it holds
in trust for the use and benefit of the depositor.
The courts will enforce an implied agreement on the
part of the bank to return the moneys deposited with it
in reliance upon the invalid security, and those deposits
never become general assets of the bank which its subsequently appointed receiver may distribute ratably
among the bank's unsecured creditors. Scott v. Armstrong, 146 U.S. 499; Central TransportationCo. v. Pullman Car Co., 139 U.S. 24; Aldrich v. Chemical Nat. Bank,

Opinion of the Court.

Messrs. Henry E. Hackney and Thornton Hardie, with
whom Messrs. Ben R. Howell, F. G. Awalt, and George
P. Barse were on the brief, for respondent.
By leave of Court, Messrs. Charles N. Burch and Edward W. Smith filed a brief on behalf of the Illinois Central Railroad Co., as amicus curiae.
MR.

JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The main question for decision is whether a national
bank has power to pledge a part of its assets to secure
a priv ate deposit.
The First National Bank of El Paso, Texas, failed on
September 4, 1931, and S. 0. Pottorff was appointed receiver. The Texas & Pacific Railway Company was then,
and long had been, a depositor. To secure it as such the
bank had, in January, 1931, pledged $50,000 Liberty
Bonds and held them for the Railway in the Trust Department of the bank. The balance in the Railway's regular checking account at the time of the failure was
$54,646.94. Of this claim it made proof as a secured
creditor. The receiver approved the amount of the claim,
but denied the validity of the pledge; and he tendered
a dividend check only for the amount to which the Railway would have been entitled as an unsecured creditor.
Thereupon, the Railway brought, in the federal court
for western Texas, this suit against the receiver, praying,
in the alternative, that the bonds be delivered to it; or
that they be sold for its benefit; or that the claim be
paid in full with interest. The receiver filed a cross-bill
praying that the bank's title to the bonds be quieted.
The case was first heard upon motions to dismiss the
bill and the cross-bill. *The decision on the motions
was postponed until after hearing the case upon the evidence. Thereupon the court dismissed the bill and en-

291 U.S.

tered a decree for the receiver upon the cross-bill, holding
that the pledge was void and that the Liberty Bonds
constituted assets to be administered for the benefit of the
general creditors of the bank. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree. 63 F. (2d) 1. This Court
granted certiorari. The Railway contends that the bank
had power to make the pledge; that even if the bank
did not have such power, the receiver is not in a position
to question the validity of the pledge; and that even if
he is not estopped from doing so, he may not disaffirm
it without returning the consideration therefor received
by the bank. We are of opinion that none of these contentions is sound.
The District Court found the following additional facts.
The relation between the Railway and the bank began in
1922 when the Railway was in receivership. Then, an
order was entered appointing the bank a depositary upon
condition that it should furnish a bond with solvent sureties. An acceptable bond was then given in the sum of
$25,000. When, in 1924, the receivership terminated, the
Railway continued its deposit account; and a bond in like
amount was given with the National Surety Company as
surety. When, in 1927, the average deposits had increased
to about $50,000, an additional bond of $25,000 was given
with the Maryland Casualty Company as surety. While
these bonds were in full force and effect and the bank was
solvent, it requested the Railway to accept, in substitution for the surety bonds, the pledge of the $50,000 Liberty Bonds, giving as its reason for the request that the
premiums payable on the surety bonds were a burden
from which it wished to be relieved. The Railway expressed willingness to assent to the substitution, but only
on condition that thereby it would be as fully protected
as by the surety bonds. The bank and its attorney gave
this assurance; and thereupon the pledge was substituted

245

253

Opinion of the Court.

for the surety bonds and these were cancelled. Without
that assurance, the Railway would not have consented to
the cancellation of the surety bonds; or if they had been
cancelled without its consent, would have immediately
withdrawn all of its deposits. In reliance upon the
assurances and the pledge, the Railway continued until
the failure to make deposits; and in fact increased its
deposits.
National bank examiners commenced on August 6, 1931,
an examination of the bank. Within a few days, they
learned from the bank's books that the pledge had been
made; but neither the examiners nor the Comptroller of
the Currency advised the bank's officers that the pledge
was beyond the powers of the bank or that it was irregular
or otherwise objectionable. The bank had frequently secured private deposits by surety bonds; but never before
by a pledge of assets. The examiners concluded their investigation on August 20, 1931. The failure occurred on
September 4, 1931.
First. National banks lack power to pledge their assets
to secure a private deposit. The measure of their powers
is the statutory grant; and powers not conferred by Congress are denied.1 For the Act ' under which national
banks are organized constitutes a complete system for
their government, Cook County National Bank v. United
States, 107 U.S. 445, 448; California Bank v. Kennedy,

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

167 U.S. 362, 366; First National Bank v. Missouri, 263
U.S. 640. Confessedly the power to pledge assets to secure a private deposit was not granted in specific terms.
The contention is that this power is incidental to the general grant of powers "necessary to carry on the business
of banking . . . by receiving deposits"; and, hence, is
implied.'
There is no basis for the claim that the power to pledge
assets is necessary to deposit banking. The record is
barren of evidence that the practice of so pledging assets
has ever prevailed among national banks. And facts of
which we take judicial notice indicate that among national
banks such action must have been deemed contrary to
good banking practice. From the establishment of the
system in 1864 to March 1, 1933, 2159 national banks
failed ' and there has been much litigation arising from
their insolvency; but only two other reported cases have
been found involving a pledge of assets to secure a private
deposit, and in those cases, very recent ones, the existence
of the power was denied.' Smith v. Baltimore & 0. R.
"Compare Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, 251 U.S. 264, 301.
"No mention of securing a private deposit in a national bank by a
pledge of assets or otherwise has been found in any published report
of the Comptroller (compare note 6); or in any of the 52 available
treatises or textbooks on banks and banking practice published since
1900; in any of the annual proceedings of the American Bankers Association or in any issue of the American Banker's Journal; or in any
issue of The Commercial and Financial Chronicle since 1900; or in
the New York Times Index since 1913. Compare "Contemporary
Banking," by Willis, Chapman & Robey (1933), p. 336.

Co., 48 F. (2d) 861; 56 F. (2d) 799; Illinois Central R.
Co. v. Rawlings, 66 F. (2d) 146. In the case at bar, there
is a specific finding that the transaction challenged was
the only instance in which this bank had ever pledged
assets to secure a private deposit. 'Surely action cannot
be deemed a necessary incident of a business when only
a single instance has been found in which it was taken.
Moreover, even a practice commonly pursued may not be
a necessary one."
To permit the pledge would be inconsistent with many
provisions of the National Bank Act which are designed
to ensure, in case of disaster, uniformity in the treatment
of depositors and a ratalble distribution of assets. Compare Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, 161 U.S. 275, 290.
This policy of equal treatment was held to prdclude, in
case of a national bank, even the preference under
§ 3466 of the Revised Statutes which otherwise is
accorded to the United States when its debtor becomes insolvent. Cook County National Bank v. United States,
107 U.S. 445. The effect of a pledge is to withdraw for
the benefit of one depositor part of the fund to which all
look for protection. Thereby the legitimate expectations
of a great body of the depositors are defeated and confidence in the fairness of the national banking laws
and administration is impaired. It is no answer to
say that the other depositors are benefited by the increased resources which- the pledge brings to the bank,
or at least are not harmed, since the new funds take the
place of the securities pledged and are available to meet
stance the Comptroller disapproved of such pledges by stating that
in his opinion national banks had no such power."
'Compare Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, 264 U.S. 160, 167. A
practice is not within the incidental powers of a corporation merely
because it is convenient in the performance of an express power.
Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U.S. 673, 692; compare Beaty v. Knowler's

291 U.S.

liabilities.' The immediate safety of unsecured creditors
depends on the bank remaining open and solvent; the
pledge reduces the fund of quick assets available to meet
unusual demands without any assurance that the deposit
will be used to replenish this fund.
The fact that this bank had frequently secured private
deposits by surety bonds lends no support to the contention that the power to pledge assets is necessary to carrying on the business of deposit banking. Such a practice would likewise be a departure from the policy of
equal treatment of depositors; but the loss to other depositors resulting from such action would be far less serious. A pledge withdraws capital assets, while the giving of a surety bond merely increases the bank's expenses.
There is, however, no finding that among national banks
8 These

arguments seem to ign6re the realities of the banking busi-

ness. The primary interest of a depositor is that the bank shall be
able to pay as and when he demands payment. The ability to do so
depends not on the bulk of the assets but on their liquidity. The law
applicable to national banks requires them to maintain as reserves in
the form of cash or of cash balances with a federal reserve bank, fixed
Percentages of their demand deposits in order to assure ability to
meet probable demands as they arise; but such reserve is commonly
deemed insufficient to meet possible emergencies. Because of this,
soundly managed banks maintain so-called "secondary reserves," usually in the form of government obligations which can be liquidated
quickly with little or no loss. The effect of pledging quick assets for
particular deposits is to reduce the fund available for meeting current demands of an unexpected nature. The funds received from the
deposit are not necessarily an equivalent for the securities withdrawn
from available resources. In the first place the deposit, in the process
of clearing and collection, may serve merely to cancel liabilities against
the bank. This may mean that there will be fewer competing claims
in case of insolvency, but it will still be true that the reserves have
been depleted considerably beyond what would be justifidd by reason
of the cancellation of the liability. In the second place, to the extent
that the deposit represents free funds, it is not probable that the
deposit will be used to buy other low yield quick assets to take the
place of those which have been pledged.

TEXAS & PACIFIC RY. v. POTTORFF.

Opinion of the Court.

there exists the practice of securing by surety bonds some
private deposits. If there has been such a practice, it must
have been a secret one; for reference to it has not been
found in either official reports, or the books on banking
or other publications dealing with financial affairs.'
Whether a national bank could legally engage in such a
practice we have no occasion to decide."
The Railway insists that Congress in providing that
the Secretary of the Treasury might deposit public money
in national banks upon receiving satisfactory security by
"the deposit of United States bonds or otherwise," Act of
June 3, 1864, c. 106, § 45, 13 Stat. 113," assumed a gen' See note 4. However, combare Lunt, Surety Bonds (1930), 206.
"Nebraska v. First National Bank of Orleans, 88 Fed. 947, and Interstate National Bank v. Ferguson, 48 Kan. 732; 30 Pac. 237, held in
the case of a deposit of public funds that the practice was legal. Two
Attorneys General have expressed the opinion that national banks
lacked the power to pay for guaranteeing all depositors. 27 Op. Atty.
Gen. 37, 40; 272, 279. But see 30 Op. Atty. Gen. 341, contra.
' The original national bank act of 1863 had provided merely that
the Secretary of the Treasury might deposit public moneys in national
banks. By legislation subsequent to 1864 national banks have been
made depositaries of moneys of bankrupt estates, Act of July 1, 1898,
c. 541, § 61, 30 Stat. 562; of Indian moneys, March 3, 1911, c. 210,
§ 17, 36 Stat. 1070; May 25, 1918, c. 86, § 28, 40 Stat. 591; of funds in
the hands of the receivers of insolvent national banks, May 15, 1916,
c. 121, 39 Stat. 121; of postal funds, May 18, 1916, c. 126, § 2, 39 Stat.
159; of proceeds from the sale of bonds, Sept. 24, 1917, c. 56, § 8,
40 Stat. 291; April 4, 1918, c. 44, § 5, 40 Stat. 504; July 9, 1918,
c. 142, § 4, 40 Stat. 845; and of a number of other public funds. In
all of these statutes the depositor is required to take security; but
therein likewise nothing is said as to the power of the bank to pledge
the required securities. Two of these statutes, those relating to deposits of the funds of insolvent banks and of bankrupt estates, have
reference to the deposit of private funds. In sbme of the legislation,
not only national, but state, banks also are made depositaries. It is
true that Congress cannot make valid a pledge by a state bank, but
that does not make it any the less likely that Congress intended to
make valid every pledge by a national bank that would be called for

eral power in national banks to pledge their assets to secure deposits; and that the assumption indicates that it
intended this power to be among the "incidental" powers
granted by § 8. But without such assumption, the duty
of the Secretary to demand a pledge authorizes a national
bank to make it.' 2 We may not import into § 8 a meaning not derivable from the words of that section and inconsistent with other provisions of the Act. Moreover,
if the Railway's argument were sound it would have been
unnecessary to amend § 45 as was done by the Act of
June 25, 1930, c. 604, 46 Stat. 809, which provides:
"Any association may, upon the deposit with it of
public money of a State or any political subdivision
thereof, give security for the safe-keeping and prompt
payment of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is
authorized by the law of the State in which such association is located in the case of other banking institutions in
the State."
This amendment indicates that Congress believed that
the original Act had not granted general power to
pledge assets to secure deposits. 13 The fact that the
amendment was made to § 45 indicates that the
power to pledge was granted only as an incident of the
public officer's duty to demand a pledge. If, as is sugunder the statute. It would be the duty of a public officer depositing
in a state bank to make sure that it had the power to give the security

Opinion of the Court.

gested, the 1930 amendment was passed merely in order
to settle doubts as to the power of a national bank to
pledge its assets to secure deposits, the amendment would
naturally have been made not to § 45, but to § 8 which
contains the grant of "incidental " powers.
The Railway urges also that since the relation of the
bank to its depositors is that of debtor to creditor, and
since a national bank may borrow money, Aldrich v.
Chemical National Bank, 176 U.S. 618; Auten v. U.S.
National Bank, 174 U.S. 125, and pledge its assets therefor, Wyman v. Wallace, 201 U.S. 230, it may likewise
pledge assets to secure a private deposit. The fallacy of
this contention has been many times exposed.14 The difference between deposits and loans is fundamental and
far-reaching. The amount of the deposits is commonly
accepted as a measure of the bank's success; an increase
of deposits as evidence of increased prosperity. The depositor does not think of himself as lending money to the
bank. The modern deposit grew out of the older form
of deposit in which the fund was held separate and intact,
and the sole purpose of the deposit was safe-keeping.
Safe-keeping is still a very important function of deposit
banking; and from the point of view of most depositors the
chief one.'
Borrowing by a bank (as distinguished from
a re-discount) is commonly regarded as evidence of weak" Farmers & Merchants Bank v. Consolidated School District, 174

" Though large deposits frequently represent loans by the bank to
the depositor, this is less-likely to be true of small accounts. Out of
30,556,105 accounts reported by 5,500 licensed member banks of the
Federal Reserve System, 29,482,384 were under $2,500 and the average size of these accounts was $189. Federal Reserve Bulletin, July

ness.16 Often the loan is made in the hope of averting
insolvency. Loans made by one bank to another commonly involve a pledge of assets, since only upon such a
condition is the transaction possible. Wyman v. Wallace,
supra.
Second. The receiver is not estopped to deny the validity of the pledge. The Railway's argument is that the
bank could not set up the defence of ultra vires since it
had the benefit of the transaction; and that the receiver,,
as its representative, can have no greater right. Neither
branch of the argument is well founded. The bank itself
could have set aside this transaction. It is the settled
doctrine of this Court that no rights arise on an ultra
vires contract, even though the contract has been performed; and that this conclusion cannot be circumvented
by erecting an estoppel which would prevent challenging
the legality of a power exercised. California Bank v.
Kennedy, 167 U.S. 362; McCormick v. Market Bank, 165
U.S. 538; Central TransportationCo. v. Pullman Co., 139
U.S. 24." But even if the bank would have been estopped from asserting lack of power, its receiver would be
free to challenge the validity of the pledge. The unau"oThe Comptroller of the Currency has insisted on the distnction
between deposits and borrowings and has stated that to list borrowings as deposits-e.g., as certificates of deposit-is a grave misrepresentation of the condition of the bank. Annual Report 1890, p. 13;
1892, p. 39.

thorized pledge reduced the assets available to the general
creditors. It is the duty of the receiver of an insolvent
corporation to take steps to set aside transactions which
fraudulently or illegally reduce the assets available for the
general creditors, even though the corporation itself was
not in a position to do so. 8
Third. The receiver may assert the invalidity of the
pledge without making restitution by paying the pledgee's
claim in full. The Railway's argument to the contrary is
that when as a result of an ultra vires contract one of the
parties is enriched at the expense of the other, the law
creates an obligation to repay ex aequo et bono to the
extent of the enrichment. The argument if applicable
would not help the Railway. Such claim under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is assimilated to an obligation
of contract; and does not, in the absence of an identifiable
res I' and a constructive trust based on special circumCo., 130 U.S. 1; Concord First Nat. Bank v. Hawkins, 174 U.S. 364;
