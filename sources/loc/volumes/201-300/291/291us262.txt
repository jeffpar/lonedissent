CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 400. Argued December 7, 8, 1933.-Decided February 5, 1934.
1. Under the national banking laws, a national bank has no power to

Argument for Petitioner.

Pope, and R. T. Cook were on the brief, for petitioner.
Mr. William Cattron Rigby also participated in the oral
argument in behalf of petitioner.
Solvent national banks have always had the power
to pledge assets as security for deposits of public funds.
Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 101; Rev. Stats.,
§ 5136; 12 U.S.C., § 24; Smith v. Lansing, 22 N.Y. 520;
United States v. Robertson, 5 Pet. 641; Planters Bank v.
Sharp, 6 How. 300; § 45, Act of June 3, 1864, supra;
Rev. Stats., § 5153; National Bank v. Graham, 100 U.S.
699.
The power is likewise necessarily implied from the
provision in the National Bank Act forbidding transfers
of assets by an insolvent bank with a view to a preference
of one creditor to another. § 52.
Congress further recognized the power, as incidental to
the right to receive deposits, in statutes requiring custodians of public funds to obtain collateral security from
the state or national banks in which such funds are deposited. See Rev. Stats., § 5234, as amended by 12 U.S.C.,
§ 192; Federal Reserve Act, § 9, as amended by 45 Stat.
492; 12-U.S.C., § 332;'39 U.S.C., § 759; 25 U.S.C., §§ 156,
162; 31 U.S.C., § 771. In each of these Congress has
assumed that not only national banks, but state banks
as well, have general power to pledge their assets as
security for deposits of public money and that the exeir
cise of such power is merely an ordinary incident of the
business of banks of deposit. See opinion by Sparks, J.,
in the court below in this case.
The Comptroller of the Currency has consistently taken
the position that national banks have the right to secure
deposits of public money. Pottorf] v. Road District, 62
F. (2d) 498; Smith v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 48 F.

State banks in Illinois have this general power. 'There
is no constitutional or statutory prohibition of any kind.
Ward v. Johnson, 95 Ill. 215, upholds the power. This
decision has never been questioned, but long been relied upon. No subsequent legislation has been inconsistent with it.

Opinion of the Court.

291 U.S.

In any event, the Receiver of the Bank can not, after
the pledge has been fully executed and deposits made in
reliance thereon, come into a court of equity and disaffirm
the transaction consummated in good faith while the Bank
was solvent.

Mr. Charles C. Murrah was on the brief, for respondents.

Mr. Leland K. Neeves.
MR. JUSTIcE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The Act of June 25, 1930, c. 604, 46 Stat. 809, amends
§ 45 of the National Bank Act of 1864 ' by adding thereto
the following:
"Any association may, upon the deposit with it of public money of a State or any political subdivision thereof,
give security for the safe-keeping and prompt payment
of the money so deposited, of the same kind as is' authorized by the law of the State in which such association
is located in the case of other banking institutions in the
State."
The controlling question is whether Illinois has conferred upon banks organized under its laws power to
pledge assets as security for deposits of public moneys of
political subdivisions of the State.
In 1931, the city of Marion, Illinois, was operating
under the "Commission Form of Government." Cahill's
1931 Rev. Stat., Chap. 24. Pars. 323-384. That statute
'Act of June 3, 1864, c. 106, § 8, 13 Stat. 101; R.S. 5336; 12 U.S.C..

Opinion of the Court.

required the treasurer of a city to give a bond; and to
"make his daily deposits of such sums of money as shall
be received by him from all sources of revenue whatsoever,
to his credit, as treasurer of said city.., in one or more
banks to be selected by the president of said council, the
commissioner of accounts and finance, and the treasurer
of such city ...or any two of them, and any such bank
before any such deposit is made therein . . .shall also
execute a good and sufficient bond with sureties to be approved by the president of said council and conditioned
that such bank will safely keep and account for and pay
over said money.. ." (Par. 374.)
Carroll having been appointed treasurer of Marion,
applied to the Fidelity and Casualty Company of New
York to become surety on his official bond. Although
Marion has a population of 9,000, it was then without
a bank. The Fidelity Company agreed to become surety
on Carroll's bond provided he would get elsewhere a bank
which would give satisfactory collateral security for the
repayment of his deposits of the public moneys. The City
National Bank of Herrin agreed to do this. Thereafter,
it delivered to the Continental Illinois National Bank
and Trust Company of Chicago, as escrow agent, negotiable bonds of the par value of $23,000, under an agreement so to secure the City's deposit; the Fidelity Company executed Carroll's official bond; and he made his
initial deposit in the Herrin bank of the City's moneys.
That bank was then solvent. On October 31, 1931, it
failed and a receiver was appointed. At the time of the
failure the City's deposit was $16,430.00.
Ben Sneeden, the receiver, brought, in the federal court
for eastern Illinois, this suit against the City, its treasurer,
the surety and the escrow agent. Setting forth the above
facts, he prayed that the pledge be declared ultra vires
and void; that the bonds be delivered to hin as receiver;
and that, meanwhile, the defendants be enjoined from dis-

posing of them. The District Court dismissed the bill.
58 F. (2d) 341. Its decree was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals. one judge dissenting. 64 F. (2d) 721.
This Court granted certiorari.
The petitioners contend that the pledge is valid because
the Act of 1864, as originally enacted, conferred upon
national banks, as a necessary incident of the business of
deposit banking, the power to pledge assets to secure deposits; and that the amendment of June 25, 1930, did not
limit the power so originally conferred. They contend
further that even if the 1930 amendment be construed as
denying to a national bank power to make such a pledge
unless it is located in a State which grants the power to
its state banks, the pledge here challenged is valid, because
in Illinois, state banks have the power to pledge assets as
security for deposits of public moneys of any political subdivision of the state. The petitioners contend also that
even if the pledge was without authority in law, the bill
was properly dismissed by the District Court, because the
bank could not have required return of the bonds without
repaying the deposit and that it would be inequitable to
permit the receiver to do so. We think these contentions
are unsound.
First. For the reasons stated in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co.
v. Pattorff, decided this day, ante, p. 245, we are of opinion
that the Act of 1864 did not confer the power to pledge
assets to secure any public deposits except those made under § 45 by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United
States. The power conferred by each later act, except
that of 1930, was limited to securing specific federal
funds.2 A national bank could not legally pledge assets
to secure funds of a State, or of a political subdivision
thereof, prior to the 1930 amendment; and since then it
'See Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Pottorff, ante, p. 215, note 11.

MARION v. SNEEDEN.
262

Opinion of the Cofirt.

can do so legally only if it is located in a State in which
state banks are so authorized. In some States national
banks had, prior to the 1930 amendment, frequently
pledged assets to secure public deposits of the State or of
a political subdivision thereof; comptrollers of the currency knew that this was being done; and they assumed
that the banks had the power so to do. But the assumption was erroneous. The contention that such power is
generally necessary in the business of deposit banking has
not been sustained.
Second. Banks organized under the laws of Illinois do
not appear to possess the power of pledging assets to secure the deposit of public moneys of a political subdivision
of the State. Illinois corporations have only such powers
as are conferred by statute either expressly or by implication; and only those powers are conferred by implication
which are reasonably necessary to carry out the powers expressly granted, People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130
Ill. 268; 22 N.E. 798; Calumet Dock Co. v. Conkling, 273
Ill. 318; 112 N.E. 982. No Illinois statute confers in express terms upon banks organized under its laws either
the general power to pledge assets to secure a deposit; or
the general power to pledge assets to secure public deposits. A statute confers in terms the power to pledge
assets to secure deposits of the State but there is none
which so confers the power to pledge assets to secure
public deposits of a political subdivision of the State.8 No
In the Banking Act of 1919, Cahill's 1931 Ill. Rev. Stats., c. 16a,
Par. 1, which, reenacting the law of 1887, provides for the organization of banks "for the purpose of . . . deposit" there is complete
silence on this subject. The only references in any Illinois statute concerning the pledge of assets to secure a deposit are the following:
(a) Section 10 of the State Depositary Act of 1919 (Cahill's 1931
Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 130, Par. 29) provides: "No moneys in the State
Treasury shall be deposited in any bank approved- as a depositary

291 U.S.

reported decision rendered by any Illinois court since the
enactment of the General Banking Law of 1887 holds that
the alleged power exists as one incidental to the business of
deposit banking. Nor is there any evidence that in Illinois such power is necessary in the conduct of the business
of deposit banking.
Ward v. Johnson, 95 Ill. 215, 217, decided in 1880, is
relied upon as authority for the proposition that Illinois
banks have power to pledge assets to secure deposits.
That case arose under the charter of "The Merchants,
Farmers and Mechanics Savings Bank," which was
granted long before the General "Bankin Act of 1887.
The pledge involved therein was given to secure a transaction which appears to have been a loan as distinguished
from a deposit. The transaction dealt with private funds.
The statement was there made that banks have authority
to pledge assets to secure deposits. If that statement expresses the law of the State, Illinois banks have had for
more than half a century power to pledge their assets to
secure private deposits as well as deposits of public moneys
of its political subdivisions. But the case has never been
referred to since on this point in any reported opinion of
any Illinois court. 4 During that period, many state
under the terms of this Act until such bank shall have deposited security with the State Treasurer equal in market value to the amount
of moneys deposited.
(b) Section 11 of the Banking Act as amended in 1929 (Cahill's
1931 Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 16a, par. 11) provides that a receiver of a
closed bank:
"Shall deposit daily all moneys collected by him in any state or national bank selected by th6 auditor who shall require of such depository satisfactory securities or satisfactory surety bond for the safe
keeping and prompt payment of the money so- deposited."
'Courts of other States have referred to it as -authority for the
proposition that banks have the power to pledge assets to secure deposits. See Williams v. Earhart, 34 Ariz. 565; 273 Pac. 728; First

Opinion of the Court.

banks have failed;5 and there must have been much litigation arising therefrom; but no exertion of the alleged
power on the part of any state bank has been showA.
An authoritative determination of the question whether
Illinois banks have power to pledge assets to secure the
deposit of public moneys of a political subdivision of the
State can be given only by its highest court. The District Court discussed, but did not decide, that question.
Its decision dismissing the bill was rested on the ground
that the National Bank Act as enacted in 1864 had conferred the general power to pledge assets to secure deposits; and that the power so granted had not been lessened by the later legislation. The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals being of opinion that national
banks lacked the power to pledge assets to secure deposits
(except so far as conferred by the 1930 amendment) necessarily passed upon the applicable Illinois law. After
careful consideration, it reached the conclusion that Illinois had not conferred upon its banks the power to
pledge assets to secure deposits of political subdivisions
of the State. Its reasons are set forth fully and persuasively; and the decisions of the courts of other States

since. Of these 26 had charters granted prior to Dec. 6, 1888; and
1,840 were organized thereafter under the general law. The number
of banks in operation Dec. 31, 1932 was 742. The number then in receivership was 444. Between Dec. 31, 1932 and March 1, 1933, 32

reached.
Third. Since the Herrin bank was without power t9
make the pledge of bonds here in question, its receiver
is entitled to recover them unconditionally in order that
they may be administered for the benefit of the general
creditors of the bank. See Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v.

1. In determining the value of a devise to charities of a remainder
contingent upon the death without issue of a female life tenant
in order that such value may be deducted from gross income
in computing the federal estate tax, it is permissible to prove that
before the death of the testator the life tenant became incapable of
having issue, as the result of a surgical operation by which her
procreative organs were removed. P. 281.
2. The ancient rule that a woman is conclusively presumed to be
capable of bearing children as long as she lives, was, like other irrebuttable presumptions, a rule of expediency or policy, based upon
the belief that to permit proof of the facts would result in injuries
of greater consequence than the predominance of truth over error
in the cases to which it applied. P. 281.
3. Applicability of this presumption remains a proper subject of
judicial inquiry in the light of modern knowledge and experience.
