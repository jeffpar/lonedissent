finding is explicit that "some collections from premiums
were made in January and February, 1921 " and "Huff
was unable to determine the amount of Huff & Mabry's
assets before the close of 1920." In February, 1921, the
firm assets were found to amount to $3,228.65 and this
sum was paid to the association, with the amount paid
by Huff as above stated. Upon these facts we find no
basis for the conclusion that Huff sustained a deductible
loss in 1920.
Second. The respondents make an alternative claim
upon the ground that the amount due Huff by his firm
was a debt "ascertained to be worthless" and hence deductible under § 214 (a) (7) of the Revenue Act of 1921.
This claim was not passed upon by the Circuit Court of
Appeals, but it was considered and rejected, properly as
we think, by the Board of Tax Appeals. The facts as
found show that the results of the firm's business were
not known prior to 1921 and that no portion of the debt
was ascertained to be worthless within the preceding taxable year.
Judgment reversed.
VOEHL v. INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY
OF NORTH AMERICA.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA.

No. 315.

Argued January 13, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. In a case under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, as applied to employment in the District of
Columbia, the issue before the deputy commissioner was whether
the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment.
This turned on the general nature and scope of the employee's
duties, the particular instructions he had received, the practice
that obtained as to work in extra hours or on Sundays, and the
purpose of a journey in which he was injured. Held:

VOEHL v. INDEMNITY INS. CO.

Argument for Respondent.

(1) That Congress had power to invest the deputy commissioner
with authority to determine these questions after proper hearing
and upon proper evidence; and
(2) That the findings of fact made by the deputy commissioner
in the course prescribed by the statute and upon sufficient evidence,
are conclusive. Crowell v. Benson, 285 U. S. 22. P. 166.
2. When by agreement, either express or implied in the course of
business, the service of an employee in extra hours or on special
errands begins when he leaves his home on the duty assigned and
continues until his return, the hazards of the journey may properly
be regarded as hazards of the service and hence within the
Compensation Act. P. 169.

his employment. Collins v. Brooklyn Union Gas Co.,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES delivered the opinion of
-the Court.

By the Act of Congress of May 17, 1928 (45 Stat. 600,
D. C. Code, Tit. 19, §§ 11, 12), the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33
U. S. C., §§ 901-950) are made applicable to employees,
as stated, in the District of Columbia. Petitioner, Karl
F. Voehl, an employee of the National Electrical Supply
Company, which was engaged in business in the District,
filed a claim for compensation for an injury sustained
through an automobile accident while he was on his way
to his employer's place of business on Sunday, April 6,
1930, for the purpose, according to his contention, of
performing the duties assigned to him. The employer
was notified and hearing was had before the deputy commissioner. Respondent, the insurance carrier of the employer, contested the claim. Admitting that the relationship of employer and employee existed on the date
of the injury and that the employer was subject to the
Compensation Act, respondent defended upon the ground
that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of
the employment. The deputy commissioner received the
evidence offered, which -ncluded the testimony of the
employer's manager with respect to the petitioner's duties,
and made a compensation order setting forth detailed
findings of fact supporting the claim and awarding
compensation.
Respondent then filed a bill of complaint in the Supreme Court of the District to obtain an injunction restraining the enforcement of the compensation order and
annexed to the bill, as a part thereof, the full record of

the proceedings and evidence before the deputy commissioner. Respondent charged that the compensation
order, findings and award, were not in accordance with
law and were not supported by the evidence. Petitioner
was permitted to intervene. Motion by the deputy commissioner to dismiss the bill of complaint was granted
and decree was entered accordingly. On appeal, the
Court of Appeals of the District, taking a different view of
the evidence, reversed the decree, 58 F. (2d) 1074, and
the case comes here on certiorari.
The relation of master and servant admittedly existed.
The business of the employer, carried on within the District, and the nature of the petitioner's employment, were
such that both were subject to the Compensation Act.
D. C. Code, Tit. 19, §§ 11, 12. By the express provisions
of the Act, the deputy commissioner was authorized to
entertain the claim of the employee and "to hiear and
determine all questions in respect of such claim." 33 U. S.
C., § 919 (a). The proceedings of the deputy commissoner conformed to the statute. The precise issue,
whether the injury arose out of and in the course of the
employment, turned on the general nature and scope of
the employee's duties, the particular instructions he had
received and the practice which obtained as to work in
extra hours or on Sundays, and the purpose of the journey
in which he was injured. We think that there can be no
doubt of the power of the Congress to invest the deputy
commissioner, as it has invested him, with authority to
determine these questions after proper hearing and upon
sufficient evidence. And when the deputy commissioner,
following the course prescribed by the statute, makes such
a determination, his findings of fact supported by evidence
must be deemed to be conclusive. Crowell v. Benson, 285
U. S. 22, 46, 47; L'Hote v. Crowell, 286 U. S. 528.
The deputy commissioner found that petitioner was
injured while on his way to the employer's warehouse for

VOEHL v. INDEMNITY INS. CO.

Opinion of the Court.

the purpose of clearing it of debris in accordance with his
duties, and that when so engaged on Sunday the terms of
his employment covered the period of service from the
time he left his home until his return, his compensation
for this service being at an agreed rate per hour for the
entire time with an allowance for his transportation. We
think that these findings were supported by the proof.
From the testimony of the employer's manager, who had
supervision of petitioner's work, it appeared that petitioner, being employed in the 'refrigeration division' of
the Supply Company, had charge of the maintenance and
operation of the company's warehouse and of the maintenance of service on refrigerators in customers' homes. He
was the "head of the products division." With other
matters, it was his duty to see that the buildings and stock
were kept in proper order and that there was compliance
with the fire rules. He had strict instructions with respect to the disposition of debris and their prompt removal. Voehl was a trusted employee who had been with
the company for sixteen years and the company relied
upon him to attend to whatever was necessary in the line
of his work without specific or detailed instructions. His
regular hours at the company's building were from 7:30
A. M. to 5:30 P. M. The manager testified that, in additioi to these hours, Voehl was " on duty all of the time, on
our call. That is to say, he was a very willing employee
and we kept him purposely for taking care of emergencies
and seeing that all details were cleaned up properly." By
reason of the 24-hour service which the company maintained, Voehl was always subject to the calls of customers,
responding either personally or through one of the service
men under his direction. He had access to the warehouse
at all times. Voehl used his own automobile, and when
he was at work for the company outside of "office hours"
and on Sundays he was paid a mileage rate of five cents
a mile for the use of his car and at the rate of 75 cents per

hour from the time he left his home until his return. As
the one in charge of the warehouse and service, Voehl
submitted weekly a memorandum of the overtime of the
employees under him and his own. The company had
found him to be honest in his statements and his overtime
account was never questioned.
Respondent's contention was that Voehl was going
to the warehouse for a purpose of his own,-to obtain
ashes to place in front of his house, being accompanied
by his brother-in-law to assist him in their removal. The
evidence showed that the company did not object to the
employees taking ashes but their removal was not part
of Voehl's work. Voehl's statement was that the purpose
of his Sunday trip was to remove an unusual accumulation of trash, which it was his duty to remove, and that
under his orders it was necessary for him to do this on
Sunday in order that the building might be in proper
condition on the following morning. He said that he
often had "to come down on Sundays to finish cleaning
up "; that the manager inspected the warehouse "every
Monday morning to see that it was free of all trash "
and that he (Voehl) did his utmost "to have the building clean for inspection." While his brother-in-law
testified as to the intention to take the ashes, he also
said that Voehl "went there specifically to straighten
up the warehouse and bring the ashes back home when
he came back." Voehl's statement as to the necessity
of his trip on the particular Sunday, in the course of his
duties, finds corroboration in the testimony of the manager. The latter said that Voehl had authority to go to
the plant on the Sunday in question and that he could
have made a charge for his service on that day and for
his mileage. While the manager did not himself know
the condition of the plant on the day of the accident, or
the day before, he did know that there had been an
unusual amount of unpacking of refrigerators during the

VOEHL v. INDEMNITY INS. CO.
162

Opinion of the Court.

three days before the accident and that such work was
"always attended by a large accumulation of trash and
litter which must be cleared up." He said that "two
or three days prior to the accident" he had called Voehl's
attention "to the necessity of keeping it better cleared
up "; he knew that the warehouse at that time "was in
a badly littered condition." The manager also had information as to Voehl's work on previous Sundays and,
on respondent's request, furnished a statement of what
the manager described as an "exactly parallel instance "
for which Voehl had been paid, and he believed that if
the records of the busy season from April to August were
available, they would show other similar instances.
Upon this evidence and the findings of the deputy commissioner, the compensation order did not violate any
principle of law. The general rule is that injuries sustained by employees when going to or returning from
their regular place of work are not deemed to arise out of
and in the course of their employment.' Ordinarily the
hazards they encounter in such journeys are not incident
to the employer's business. But this general rule is subject to exceptions which depend upon the nature and circumstances of the particular employment. "No exact
formula can be laid down which will automatically solve
every case." Cudahy Packing Co. v. Parramore,263 U. S.
418, 424. See, also, Bountiful Brick Co. v. Giles, 276 U. S.
154, 158. While service on regular hours at a stated place
generally begins at that place, there is always room for
agreement by which the service may be taken to begin
earlier or elsewhere. Service in extra hours or on special

errands has an element of distinction which the employer
may recognize by agreeing that such service shall commence when the employee leaves his home on the duty assigned to him and shall continue until his return. And
agreement to that effect may be either express or be shown
by the course of business. In such case the hazards of the
journey may properly be regarded as hazards of the seryice and hence within the purview of the Compensation
Act.2
