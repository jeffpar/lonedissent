recast the pleadings would have been proper and helpf il.
The petition here for certiorari does not mention the
conflicting view in respect of the Exhibits or deal with
them as parts of the record. It failed adequately to advise
us concerning the real situation. But to avoid possible
misunderstanding, it has seemed best to retain jurisdiction
rather than to dismiss the writ because improvidently
granted.
The judgment of the Supreme Court affirmed by the

COOK v. UNITED STATES.
CERTIORARI

TO THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF APPEALS

FOR THE

FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 82. Argued December 7, 1932.-Decided January 23, 1933.
1. The Treaty of May 22, 1924, with Great Britain, as both its
language and its history show, was intended to deal completely
with the search and seizure beyond our territorial limits of British
vessels suspected of smuggling intoxicating liquors into this country.
P. 112.
2. Article II of the treaty declares that His Britannic Majesty " will
raise no objection " to the boarding of private vessels under the
British flag outside of the three mile limit of territorial waters in
order that inquiries may be made of those on board and an examination be made of the ship's papers, for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the vessel or those on board are endeavoring to import,
or have imported, alcoholic beverages into the United States, in
violation of the laws there in force. When this shows reasonable

ground for suspicion, a search is permitted; and if there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel, has committed, or is committing or attempting to commit, an offense against the laws of the
United States prohibiting importation of alcoholic beverages, she
may be seized and taken into a port for adjudication. But it expressly provides that the rights conferred by this Article shall not
be exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the United
States than can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected, etc.
Held that the treaty not only permits boarding, etc., beyond the
three mile limit, if the vessel is within one-hour's sailing distance,
but also forbids it beyond the three mile limit as to vessels not
within such sailing distance. Pp. 111, 118.
3. The treaty is self-executing, in that no legislation was necessary
to authorize executive action in pursuance of its provisions; and
it had the effect, (and was so interpreted in practice,) of superseding, so far as inconsistent with it, the authority conferred by
ยง 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 upon officers of the Coast Guard to
board, search and seize within four leagues of the coast. P. 118.
4. The treaty was not abrogated by reiinacting ยง 581 in the Tariff
Act of 1930 in the identical terms of the Act of 1922. P. 119.
5. A treaty will not be deemed to have been abrogated or modified
by a later statute unless such purpose on the part of Congress has
been clearly expressed; and here the contrary appears, in that
the committee reports and the debates upon the Act of 1930, like
the reenacted section itself, make no reference to the treaty.
P. 120.
6. Any doubt as to the construction of ยง 581 in this regard is resolved
by the consistent departmental practice existing before the reenactment. P. 120.
7. Section 581 continued in force, except as modified by treaties.
P. 120.
8. A British ship with unmanifested intoxicating liquors for illegal
importation was seized beyond the three-mile limit, and not within
one hour's sailing distance of the coast, and was brought into port,
where ship and cargo were libeled. Held:
(1) That the libels should be dismissed because, by reason of the
treaty, this Government lacked the power to seize the ship 'and the
power to subject her to our laws. P. 121.
(2) The doctrine that permits the United States to enforce forfeitures for violation of its laws against property of which it has
gained possession through the wrongful act of an individual, applies
where the act was such as it might have authorized beforehand,

The question concerns the venue; and the United States
by filing its libel for forfeiture may ratify what would
otherwise have been an illegal seizure. The treaty did
not change any law of the United States prescribing penalties and forfeitures. It related merely to the arrest of

persons and the seizure of property suspected of offending
against the laws designed to prevent the smuggling into
this country of intoxicating liquor. Ford v. United
States, 273 U. S. 593. The seizure, if contrary to the
treaty, could not relieve the District Court of the duty
to determine whether the res had offended against a law
of the United States and to condemn the res as forfeited.
Instead of questioning the power of the court to consider the causes alleged in the libels the claimant filed
answers which made defense upon the merits of the case.
By so doing, it would seem that he waived the right, if
any was afforded to him under the treaty, to object that
the court was without jurisdiction.
If the question of the legality of the seizure is material
and was properly raised, it becomes necessary to consider
the effect of the treaty upon the provisions of the tariff
acts. The court below held that the treaty did not repeal the clause fixing a four-league zone in the federal
customs and revenue laws, and, therefore, that the validity of the seizure beyond the treaty limits but within four
leagues of the coast was not affected. The opinion does
not discuss the decision of this Court in Ford v. United
States, 273 U. S. 593, 618-619.
The Department of Justice, since 1926, has entertained
a contrary view of the treaty in its relation to the tariff
acts.
The Commandant of the U. S. Coast Guard was advised in 1927 that all seizures of British vessels captured
in the rum-smuggling trade should be within the termsof the treaty and that seizing officers should be instructed
to produce evidence, not that the vessel was found within
the four-league limit, but that she was apprehended
within one hour's sailing distance from the coast. This
construction of the treaty finds support in the following
cases: The Frances Louise, 1 F. (2d) 1004, appeal dis-

United States v. Cargo ex British Schooner Patara,40 F.
(2d) 74. After the passage of the Tariff Act- of 1930 the
Department continued to follow this construction. The
view of the treaty taken by the Department of Justice
is in accord with that of the District Court in this case.
If that view is correct and if the question of the legality
of the seizure is material and was properly raised in the
District Court. the judgment of the court below should be
reversed.
Lawyers for the Government other than those employed in the Department of Justice take a different view
of the treaty in its relation to the tariff acts. In their
view the result reached by the court below was correct.
The contention is that the treaty was not a limitation
upon the right to search and seize British vessels within
the twelve-mile limit, but was an extension of the right
always conceded to search and seize within the three-mile
limit so as to permit seizures beyond territorial waters,
provided the vessel was within one hour's sailing distance;
that there was no intention on the part of the United
States or Great Britain to surrender claims of sovereign
right, except that Great Britain waived its right to protest seizures beyond the three-mile limit in a very limited
number of cases defined in the treaty, in return for which
her ships were permitted to transport intoxicating liquors
within the territorial waters of the United States as part
of their stores.

COOK v. UNITED STATES.
102

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The main question for decision is whether ยง 581 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, c. 497, 46 Stat. 590, 747, is modified,
as applied to British vessels suspected of being engaged in
smuggling liquors into the United States, by the Treaty
between this country and Great Britain proclaimed May
22, 1924. (43 Stat. 1761.) That section-which is a reenactment in identical language of ยง 581 of the Tariff
Act of 1922, c. 356, 42 Stat. 858, 979--declares that officers
of the Coast Guard are authorized to stop and board any
vessel at any place within four leagues (12 miles) of the
coast of the United States " to examine the manifest and
to inspect, search and examine " the vessel and any merchandise therein; and if it shall appear that any violation of any law of the United States has been committed
by reason of which the vessel or merchandise is liable
to forfeiture, it shall be the duty of such officers to seize
the same.
On the evening of November 1, 1930, the British motor
screw Mazel Tov-a vessel of speed not exceeding 10
miles an hour-was discovered by officers of the Coast
Guard within four leagues of the coast of Massachusetts
and was boarded by them at a point 111/ miles from the
nearest land. The manifest Was demanded and exhibited.
Search followed, which disclosed that the only cargo on
board, other than ship stores, was unmanifested intoxicating liquor which had been cleared from St. Pierre, a
French possession. The vessel ostensibly bound for Nassau, a British possession, had, when boarded, been cruising
off our coast with the intent that ultimately the liquor
should be taken to the United States by other boats. But
the evidence indicated that she did not intend to approach
nearer than four leagues to our coast; and, so far as ap-

108

Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

peared, she had not been in communication with our
shores and had not unladen any part of her cargo. The
boarding officers seized the Mazel Tov at a point more
than 10 miles from our coast; took her to the Port of
Providence; and there delivered the vessel and cargo to
the customs officials.
The Collector of Customs, acting pursuant to ยง 584 of
the Tariff Act of 1930, assessed against Frank Cook, as
master of the Mazel Tov, a penalty of $14,286.18 for
failure to include the liquor in the manifest. By ยง 584, if
merchandise not described in the manifest is found on
board a vessel "bound to the United States," the master
is subject to a penalty equal to its value, and the merchandise belonging or consigned to him is subject to forfeiture.
By ยง 594, whenever a master becomes subject to a penalty,
the vessel may be seized and proceeded against summarily
by libel to recover the penalty. The Government proceeded, in the federal court for Rhode Island, to collect
the assessed penalty by means of libels against both the
cargo and the vessel. The cases were consolidated.
Cook, claiming as master and bailee of the vessel and
as consignee and claimant of the cargo, alleged that the
Mazel Toy was of British registry and owned by a Nova
Scotia corporation. He answered to the merits; and
excepted to the jurisdiction on the ground that the
"vessel was not seized within the territorial limits of any
jurisdiction of the United States, but, on the contrary,
was captured and boarded at a point more than four (4)
leagues from the coast," and that-" it was not the intention at any time to enter any of the territorial limits of
the United States."
The District Court, having found the facts above stated,
dismissed the libels. 51 F. (2d) 292. The Government
appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that
the Treaty did not "effect a change in the customsrevenue laws of the United States wherein Congress had

fixed a four league protective zone"; reversed the judgments; and remanded the cases to the District Court for
further proceedings. 56 F. (2d) 921. This Court
granted certiorari.'
Cook contends, among other things, that by reason of
the Treaty between the United States and Great Britain
proclaimed May 22, 1924 (43 Stat. 1761), the seizure was
unlawful under the laws of the United States; that the
authority conferred by ยง 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 to
board, search and seize within the four league limit, was,
as respects British vessels, 2 modified by the Treaty so as

view that the Treaty modified the limits within which British

vessels might be seized for violation of the laws 'prohibiting alcoholic
liquors is supported by the following cases: The Frances Louise, 1 F.

11 F. (2d) 673, 675; The Over the Top, 5 F. (2d) 838, 844; Ford v.

925, 926; United States v. Schouweiler, 19 F. (2d) 387; compare
United States v. Cargo ex British Schooner Patara,40 F. (2d) 74. In
other cases the view has been expressed that the treaties did not restrict, at all events, the right of seizure. The Vinces, 20 F. (2d) 164,
174, affirmed sub nom. Gillam v. United States, 27 F. (2d) 296 (compare id., p. 301); The Panama, 6 F. (2d) 326, 327; The Resolution,
30 F. (2d) 534, 537-538; The Pescawha, 45 F. (2d) 221, 222. Compare, also, the following cases in which seizure was made within twelve
miles but in which it does not appear whether it was made within an
hour's sailing distance or whether the question of the effect of the
treaties was raised. The Mistinguette, 27 F. (2d) 738; United States
v. 63 Kegs of Malt, 27 F. (2d) 741; The Newton Bay, 30 F. (2d) 444,

to substitute for four leagues from our coast, the distance
which "can be traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense "; that Congress by re-enacting ยง 581 in the Tariff Act of 1930 intended to continue in force the modification effected by
the Treaty; and, hence, that the Mazel Tov, being a British vessel of a speed not exceeding 10 miles an hour, could
not be lawfully boarded, searched and seized at a distance
of 111/2 miles from the coast because suspected of " endeavoring to import or have imported alcoholic beverages
into the United States in violation of the laws there in
force."
The Government insists that the Treaty did not have
the effect of so modifying ยง 581 of the Act of 1922; and
that, if it did, the re-enactment of ยง 581 without change,
by the Act of 1930, removed the alleged modification. It
contends further that the validity of the seizure was not
material; and if ever material had been waived.
The Treaty provides, among other things, as follows:
"Article I. The High Contracting Parties declare that
it is their firm intention to uphold the principle that 3
marine miles extending from the coast line outwards and
measured from low-water mark constitute the proper limits of territorial waters.
"Article II. (1) His Britannic Majesty agrees that he
will raise no objection to the boarding of private vessels

Poland, August 8, 1930 (46 Stat. 2773); Chile, November 26, 1930
(46 Stat. 2852). The only substantial difference in these treaties is in
Article One, dealing with the general principle of a three-mile limit;
in the treaties with Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Cuba,
Panama and Japan, the principle is declared to be accepted, while
in the others rights and claims in that regard are declared to be
reserved.

waters by the authorities of the United States, its territories or possessions in order that enquiries may be addressed to those on board and an examination be made of
the ship's papers for the purpose of ascertaining whether
the vessel or those on board are endeavoring to import or
have imported alcoholic beverages into the United States,
its territories or possessions in violation of the laws there
in force. When such enquiries and examination show a
reasonable ground for suspicion, a search of the vessel may
be instituted.
"(2) If there is reasonable cause for belief that the vessel has committed or is committing or attempting to commit an offense against the laws of the United States, its
territories or possessions prohibiting the importation of
alcoholic beverages, the vessel may be seized and taken
into a port of the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with such laws.
"(3) The rights conferred by this article shall not be
exercised at a greater distance from the coast of the
United States, its territories or possessions than can be
traversed in one hour by the vessel suspected of endeavoring to commit the offense. In cases, however, in which
the liquor is intended to be conveyed to the United States,
its territories or possessions by a vessel other than the
one boarded and searched, it shall be the speed of such
other vessel and not the speed of the vessel boarded, which
shall determine the distance from the coast at which the
right under this article can be exercised."
We are of opinion that the decrees entered by the District Court should have been affirmed.
First. It is suggested on behalf of the Government that
the power to search and seize within the twelve-mile zone
conferred upon officers of the Coast Guard by ยง 581 of
the Tariff Act of 1922, was unaffected by the Treaty, save
that the British Government agreed not to protest where
the seizure was within an hour's sailing distance of the

112

288 U.S.

coast. The argument is that the Treaty settled the validity of the seizure only for those cases where it was made
within the limits described in the Treaty; and that since
this seizure was made beyond one hour's sailing distance
from the coast the Treaty did not apply.' In construing
the Treaty its history should be consulted. Compare
United States v. Texas, 162 U. S. 1; Oklahoma v. Texas,
260 U. S. 606; Nielsen v. Johnson, 279 U. S. 47, 52. Both
its language and its history show that the high contracting
parties did not intend so to limit its operation. The
preamble states that they entered into the Treaty "being
desirous of avoiding any difficulties which might arise
between them in connection with the laws in force in the
United States on the subject of alcoholic beverages." The
history reveals that serious differences had arisen between
the two Governments in that connection; and that, for
the purpose of resolving them, the parties determined to
deal completely with the subject of search and seizure, beyond our territoria' limits, of British vessels suspected of
smuggling liquors.
Prior to the Eighteenth Amendment the United States
had never attempted, in connection with the enforcement
of our customs laws, to board foreign vessels beyond the
three-mile limit except where consent was implied from
the fact that the vessel, being hailed, answered that she
was bound for the United States, or where a vessel had
been discovered violating our laws within the three-mile
limit and, while endeavoring to escape, was hotly pursued.
Although Hovering Acts conferring authority to board
and search vessels, foreign and domestic, "within four
leagues of the coast," had existed since the foundation of
our Government, see Act of August 4, 1790, c. 35, ยง 31,
The argument was advanced by the Solicitor General as representing the view not of the Department of Justice but of other
lawyers for the Government.

1 Stat. 145, 164,' the authority therein conferred had,
prior to the Tariff Act of 1922, been in terms limited to
inbound vessels; and no statute had purported to confer
authority to seize foreign vessels beyond our territorial
waters for violation of any of our laws, except in those
few instances in which Congress acted pursuant to specific
treaties.' But soon after the Eighteenth Amendment
took effect (January 16, 1920), vessels of British registry
were found to be engaged in smuggling intoxicating
liquors into the United States in violation of our laws.'
In the effort to prevent such violations British vessels
were being boarded, searched and seized beyond the threemile limit;" and by ยง 581 of the Tariff Act of 1922 Con'Re-enacted by Act of March 2, 1799, c. 22, ยง 71, 1 Stat. 627, 668;
and see Rev. Stat. ยง 3067.
The model for the American statutes was the British Hovering Act
of 1736, 9 Geo. II, c. 35, ยง 23, which provided for the forfeiture of
vessels under 100 tons into which foreign goods were taken within
four leagues of the coast. Compare the earlier British Hovering Acts
of 1709 and 1718: 8 Anne, c. 7, ยง 17; 5 Geo. I, c. 11. In 1876 all
existing hovering acts were repealed by the Customs Consolidation
Act, 39 & 40 Vict., c. 36, which provides in ยง 159 for the forfeiture of
vessels belonging in whole or in part to British subjects or having half
the persons on board British subjects, where the vessel is found, or
discovered to have been, within three leagues of the coast; and for the
forfeiture of other vessels found, or discovered to have been, within
one league of the coast. For the development of the British law, see

gress undertook to sanction such action through enlarging
the authority to board, search and seize beyond the threemile limit so as to include foreign vessels although not

Both before and after the passage of the Tariff Act of
1922 it was the consistent policy of our Government to
release, upon protest, all British vessels seized beyond the
three-mile limit and not bound to the United States, unless it appeared that the hovering vessel had, by means
of her own small boats and crew, assisted in landing there
contraband goods.' Our Government deemed that exFidelity & Surety Co., unreported, decided August 13, 1923, in the

resulting in adjudication, see Philip C. Jessup, The Law of Territorial
Waters and Maritime Jurisdiction, pp. 254-256.
In reply to a question in the House. of Commons on June 6, 1923,
concerning the number of British vessels seized, the Undersecretary of
State for Foreign Affairs replied: "Broadly speaking, some 20 or 25
cases are known to His Majesty's Government where vessels, mostly
of Canadian registry, have been seized. The seizures have occurred
at varying distances from the shore, some within and some without
the three-mile limit. The crews have nearly always been detained for
varying periods. His Majesty's Embassy at Washington have acted
repeatedly, and in the strongest possible manner, to secure the release
of vessels seized outside the three-mile limit, or inside it when a genuine case of distress seemed to be made out." 164 Parliamentary Debates (Commons), 5th series, col. 2212.

seizing vessels under those circumstances was not in harmony with the-law of nations;1 1 protested against the
seizure of any British vessel outside of the three-mile
limit;1" and stated that insistence upon the practice would
be regarded as creating " a very serious situation." 18
With a view to removing the British objections, the
Secretary of State proposed, on June 26, 1922, that a
treaty be entered into " under which the authorities of
each nation would be authorized to exercise beyond the
delivery of the cargo to the ports named in the clearance papers.
Ibid. The class of vessels not released was extended, in the case of
the Henry L. Marshall, to include a vessel beyond the three-mile limit,
where, although the small boats were not the vessel's own, there was
unity of control over the vessel and boats. 286 Fed. 260, affirmed,

the National Prohibition Act applied to all merchant vessels, foreign or domestic, within the territorial waters of
the United States, and that the carrying of intoxicating
liquors, either as cargo or as sea stores, through the territorial waters or into the ports and harbors of the United
States is forbidden by that Act and the Eighteenth
Amendment. The embarrassment to British vessels A.nd

two Governments which would permit the conduct by
the British of legitimate trade and remove this obstacle
to the operation of their vessels in the accustomed manner, the Secretary of State submitted to Great Britain,
on June 11, 1923, the draft of a treaty designed to remove
the friction between the two Governments. The draft
did not refer specifically to intoxicating liquors. Article
I provided, in general terms, that the authorities of each
country should " within the distance of twelve geographical miles from its coasts" be permitted to board and
search private vessels of the other to ascertain whether
such vessels were engaged in an attempt to violate its
laws "prohibiting or regulating the unloading near, or
importation into its territories of any article; " and "if
there is reasonable cause for belief" that the vessel is so
engaged to seize it. Article II, likewise, in general terms,
provided that articles on private vessels of either nation
listed as sea stores, or as cargo destined to a foreign port,
the importation of which is prohibited, might be brought
within the territorial waters of the other on condition
that they be sealed "upon arrival of the vessel so destined
within twelve geographical miles of the coasts" and be
kept sealed continuously thereafter while within the
territorial waters.
This proposal of the Secretary of State also failed to
meet with the approval of the British Government because it was regarded as involving an extension of the

however, continued; and ultimately the British Government submitted a counter-proposal, which sought to
achieve the same results by different means. The British draft provided that the high contracting parties should

declare "their firm intention to uphold the principle that
three marine miles measured from low water mark
constitute the proper limits of territorial waters "; and
avoiding all language which could possibly indicate a contrary purpose, it made no reference to the twelve-mile
limit. Moreover, the arrangement, instead of applying
generally to merchandise subject to prohibitory or regulatory laws, was to be limited specifically to intoxicating
liquors; and no reciprocal rights were to be conferred.
Each country was to secure the immunity required to
satisfy its peculiar need. The need of the United States
was to be met by providing that His Britannic Majesty
"will raise no objection to the boarding," etc., outside the
territorial waters at no "greater distance from the coast
of the United States than can be traversed in one hour
by the vessel suspected of" smuggling. The need of
Great Britain was to be met by our allowing "British
vessels voyaging to or from the ports or passing through
the waters of the United States to have on board alcoholic
liquors listed as sea stores or as cargo destined for a
foreign port, provided that such liquor is kept under seal
while within the jurisdiction of the United States." "I
The draft of treaty submitted by the British Government was accepted with a few purely verbal changes.
Thereby, as stated in Fordv. United States, 273 U. S. 593,
609-610, this country secured "a definite fixing of the
zone of legitimate seizure of hovering British vessels seeking to defeat the laws against the importation of liquor
into this country from the sea."
Second. The Treaty, being later in date than the Act of
1922, superseded, so far as inconsistent with the terms of
the Act, the authority which had been conferred by
ยง 581 upon officers of the Coast Guard to board, search

and seize beyond our territorial waters. Whitney v.
Robertson, 124 U. S. 190, 194. For in a strict sense the
Treaty was self-executing, in that no legislation was
necessary to authorize executive action pursuant to its
provisions."9
The purpose of the provisions for seizure in ยง 581, and
their practical operation, as an aid in the enforcement of
the laws prohibiting alcoholic liquors, leave no doubt that
the territorial limitations there established were modified
by the Treaty. This conclusion is supported by the
course of administrative practice. Shortly after the
Treaty took effect, the Treasury Department issued
amended instructions for the Coast Guard which pointed
out, after reciting the provisions of ยง 581, that " in cases of
special treaties, the provisions of those treaties shall be
complied with "; and called attention particularly to the
recent treaties dealing with the smuggling of intoxicating
liquors.'* The Commandant of the Coast Guard, moreover, was informed in 1927, as the Solicitor General states,
that all seizures of British vessels captured in the rumsmuggling trade should be within the terms of the Treaty
and that seizing officers should be instructed to produce
evidence, not that the vessel was found within the fourleague limit, but that she was apprehended within one
hour's sailing distance from the coast.
Third. The Treaty was not abrogated by re-enacting
ยง 581 in the Tariff Act of 1930 in the identical terms of the
"Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593. Such was the view of the
Secretary of State, expressed in a letter of March 3, 1924, to the

Act of 1922. A treaty will not be deemed to have been
abrogated or modified by a later statute unless such purpose on the part of Congress has been clearly expressed.
Chew Heong v. United States, 112 U. S. 536; United
States v. Payne, 264 U. S. 446, 448. Here, the contrary
appears. The committee reports and the debates upon
the Act of 1930, like the re-enacted section itself, make
no reference to the Treaty of 1924. Any doubt as to the
construction of the section should be deemed resolved by
the consistent departmental practice existing before its reenactment.
Compare United States v. G. Falk &
Brother, 204 U. S. 143; Nagle v. Loi Hoa, 275 U. S. 475,
481; Brewster v. Gage, 280 U. S. 327, 337; McCaughn v.
Hershey Chocolate Co., 283 U. S. 488, 492; United States
v. Ryan, 284 U. S. 167, 175. No change, in this respect,
was made either by the Department of the Treasury or
the Department of Justice after the Tariff Act of 1930.
Searches and seizures in the enforcement of the laws
prohibiting alcoholic liquors are governed, since the 193&
Act, as they were before, by the provisions of the Treaty.
Section 581, with its scope narrowed by the Treaty, remained in force after its re-enactment in the Act of 1930.
The section continued to apply to the boarding, search
and seizure of all vessels of all countries with which we
had no relevant treaties. It continued also, in the enforcement of our customs laws not related to the prohibition of alcoholic liquors, to govern the boarding of vessels
of those countries with which we had entered into treaties
like that with Great Britain.
Fourth. As the Mazel Toy was seized without warrant
of law, the libels were properly dismissed. The Government contends that the alleged illegality of the seizure is
immaterial. It argues that the facts proved show a violation of our law for which the penalty of forfeiture is
prescribed; that the United States may, by filing a libel

Opinion of the Court.

for forfeiture, ratify what otherwise would have been an
illegal seizure; that the seized vessel having been brought
into the Port of Providence, the federal court for Rhode
Island acquired jurisdiction; and that, moreover, the
claimant by answering to the merits waived any right to
object to enforcement of the penalties. The argument
rests upon misconceptions.
It is true that where the United States, having possession of property, files a libel to enforce a forfeiture resulting from a violation of its laws, the fact that the possession
was acquired by a wrongful act is immaterial. Dodge v.
United States, 272 U. S. 530, 532. Compare Ker v.
Illinois, 119 U. S. 436, 444. The doctrine rests primarily
upon the common-law rules that any person may, at his
peril, seize property which has become forfeited to, or
forfeitable by, the Government; and that proceedings by
the Government to enforce a forfeiture ratify a seizure
made by one without authority, since ratification is equivalent to antecedent delegation of authority to seize.
Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 246, 310; Taylor v. United
States, 3 How. 197, 205-206. The doctrine is not applicable here. The objection to the seizure is not that it
was wrongful merely because made by one upon whom
the Government had not conferred authority to seize at
the place where the seizure was made. The objection is
that the Government itself lacked power to seize, since
by the Treaty it had imposed a territorial limitation upon
its own authority. The Treaty fixes the conditions under
which a "vessel may be seized and taken into a port of
the United States, its territories or possessions for adjudication in accordance with " the applicable laws. Thereby, Great Britain agreed that adjudication may follow a
rightful seizure. Our Government, lacking power to
seize, lacked power, because of the Treaty, to subject the
vessel to our laws. To hold that adjudication may follow
a wrongful seizure would go far to nullify the purpose

and effect of the Treaty. Compare United States v.
Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407.
The case differs from The Richmond, 9 Cranch 102, and
The Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, where forfeitures of vessels
wrongfully seized by our Navy were upheld."' There, the
vessels seized were of American registry; and the seizures
did not violate any treaty, but were merely violations of
the law of nations because made within the territory of
another sovereign. In those cases it was held that the illegality of the seizures did not affect the venue of the action or the process of the court. Here, the objection is
more fundamental. It is to the jurisdiction of the United
States. The objection is not met by distinguishing between the custody of the Coast Guard and the subsequent
custody of the marshal. Nor is it lost by the entry of an
answer to the merits. The ordinary incidents of possession of the vessel and the cargo yield to the international
agreement.

are of opinion that in respect of British vessels engaged
in smuggling intoxicating liquor into the United States
the treaty of 1924 was not intended to cut down the rights
claimed by the United States under the hovering statutes
in force since the organization of our government, but that
it was the purpose of both countries to extend and enlarge such rights to enable the United States more effectively to enforce its liquor laws and that therefore the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.
