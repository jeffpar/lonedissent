CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 388.

Argued January 19, 20, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.

1. When instalments of war-risk insurance and disability compensation are paid to the guardian appointed under the state law, the

money ceases to be money of the United States; and if it be deposited by the guardian in a bank that becomes insolvent, R. S.
3466, giving priority of payment to debts due the United States,
does not apply. P. 433.
2. In respect of such moneys so paid and deposited, the guardian is
not an agency or instrumentality of the United States. P. 436.

the installments due his ward. The guardian deposited
them in the Hargis Bank and Trust Company. It became
insolvent and February 5, 1930, conformably to the laws
of the State, all its assets were taken over by respondent
acting as special deputy banking commissioner and
liquidating agent. At that time the guardian had on
deposit $6,070.80 derived from such payments. The
assets of the bank were not sufficient to pay more than
one-half the total owing to depositors. Claiming priority
under R. S. § 3466,2 the guardian demanded payment of
his deposit in full. Respondent held that petitioner was
only entitled to share ratably with other creditors and
refused to pay.
Petitioner brought this suit in the circuit court,,of
Breathitt county to enforce the asserted priority. That
court gave him judgment as prayed. The court of appeals reversed on the ground' that the bank was not indebted to the United States on account of the deposit
made by the guardian. 244 Ky. 68; 50 S. W. (2d) 64.
The question has not been considered here and, decisions
upon it in the state courts being in conflict, 8 we granted
a writ of certiorari. 287 U. S. 590.
"Whenever any person indebted to the United States is insolvent,
or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the
executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due
from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first
satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to
cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his
debts, makes a voluntary' assignment thereof, or in which the estate
and effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached
by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is
committed." 31 U. S. C., § 191.

Opinion 6f the Court.

Petitioner relies upon the clause of § 3466 declaring
that whenever any person indebted to the United States
is insolvent the debts due to the United States shall first
be satisfied. He asserts that, under Acts of Congress later
to be considered, the war risk insurance and disability
compensation paid to a guardian of an incompetent
veteran remains the money of the United States so long
as it is subject to his control and suggests that the guardian is a mere instrumentality of the United States for the
disbursement of such money for the benefit of the veteran.
And he maintains that the deposit here involved is money
of the United States and that the bank is indebted to it
therefor.
The pertinent substance of the provisions invoked by
petitioner follows. Section 21 (1) and (2) of the World
War Veterans' Act, 1924, provides that where any payment under the Act is to be made to a person mentally
incompetent, it may be made to the person who is constituted guardian by the laws of the State or is otherwise
legally vested with responsibility or care of the claimant or his estate. It authorizes the director to suspend
payments to a guardian who shall neglect or refuse to
render to the director from time to time an account showing the application of such payments for the benefit of
the incompetent.4 Section 22 declares that such payments shall not be assignable or subject to the claims of
creditors and that they shall be exempt from taxation, but
makes them subject to claims of the United States under
the Act against the veteran.5 Sections 21 (3) and 26 provide that in specified cases insurance and disability comCf. State ex rel. Sorenson v. Security Bank, 121 Neb. 521; 237 N. W.

pehsation remaining unpaid or in the hands of a guardian
at the death of the veteran shall escheat to the United
States." Section 214 provides that where an incompetent
veteran receiving disability compensation disappears, the
director may make payments to his dependents." Section
505 provides for punishment of guardians who shall
embezzle such funds.$
The guardian, appointed by the county court, was by
the laws of the State given the custody and control of
the personal estate of his ward and was authorized to
collect and receive the money in question. Ky. Stats.,
§ 2030. .And unquestionably payment to the guardian
vested title in the ward and operated to discharge the
obligation of the United States in respect of such installments. Taylor v. Bemiss, 110 U. S. 42, 45. Lamar v.
Micou, 112 U. S. 452, 472. Maclay v. Equitable Life

6th ed., § 892.
The provisions for exemption, non-assignability and
suspension of payments plainly imply the passage of title
from the United States to the veteran. The denunciation
of embezzlement by guardians is not inconsistent with
that intention. These regulations, like many to be found
in pension laws, disclose a purpose to safeguard to bene*Section 21 (3) added by § 5, Act of July 3, 1930, 46 Stat. 993.

ficiaries the appropriations and payments made for their
benefit (United States v. Hall, 98 U. S. 343, 353. Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256) and evince special
solicitude for the protection of veterans who by reason of
mental incompetency are unable to protect themselves.
The clauses subjecting such payments to claims of the
United States against the veteran and providing for escheat to the United States make against petitioner's claim.
Neither would be appropriate or necessary if the money
paid to such guardian continued to belong to the United
States until actually disbursed by him for the veteran's
benefit.
,. Petitioner cites United States v. Hall, supra. The question there was whether Congress has power to prescribe
punishment for the embezzlement by guardians of pension money paid them in behalf of their wards. The
indictment showed that the money alleged to have been
embezzled was the property of the accused guardian's
ward. The court held that to insure transmission unimpaired to the beneficiary the United States might annex
such conditions to the donation as it deemed appropriate
and that the guardian was bound to accept the payment
subject .to the terms of the grant and that Congress had
power to protect its gift until it passed into the hands
of the beneficiary. There is no suggestion in the opinion
that the United States had any interest as owner in the
money embezzled. The power of Congress to punish
such misappropriation is not limited to acts causing loss
to the United States. Westfall v. United States, supra,
258-259. Petitioner also cites Bramwell v. U. S. Fidelity
& G. Co., 269 U. S. 483. But in that case the United
States itself was the guardian and through its officer, the
superintendent of an Indian reservation, made the deposit which upon insolvency of the bank was held a preferred claim under § 3466. The case is not in point, as
here the guardian was appointed pursuant to state law

agent or instrumentality of the United States. Shippee v.

results that the deposit in question does not belong to
the United States. and, as indebtedness to it is essential
to priority, the guardian's claim under that section is
without merit. Other contentions made by petitioner are
so plainly inapplicable here as not to require discussion.

SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 466.

Argued February 9, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.

1. Section 301 (a) of the Revenue Act of 1926 imposes a tax "upon
the transfer of the net estate of every decedent" and § 302 requires that in computing the tax there shall be included in the gros
estate the value at the time of death of all property,
"(a) To the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the
time of his death," and
"(d) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent
has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, where the
enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any
change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent
alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or
revoke... ." Held:
(1) Subdivision (d) is not limited by (a) to interests of decedent
at time of his death. P. 442.
(2) Under subdivision (d), where the decedent had transferred
property by deeds of trust reserving power in himself to make a
complete revision of the trusts, even to the extent of taking the
property from the trustees and beneficiaries named and transferring

it absolutely or in trust for the benefit of others, although the
