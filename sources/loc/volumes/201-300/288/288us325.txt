Syllabus.

Disguise has been found to be impossible when the producers are but two or three. The phrase "trade secrets
and processes" is not a new one in the law. It occurs in
statutes and judicial decisions as well as in the rule. The
Commission was without competence by any decision it
might make to fix the meaning of the phrase as used by
Congress or the courts. It had power, however, to interpret its own rules and any phrase contained in them.

INDIAN TERRITORY ILLUMINATING OIL CO. v.
BOARD OF EQUALIZATION OF TULSA COUNTY.CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OKLAHOMA.

No. 356. Argued January 17, 18, 1933.-Decided February 13, 1933.
1. The owner of oil extracted by him from restricted Indian lands
under leases approved by the Secretary of the Interior, is not
immune from taxation of it under the general laws of the State
for ad valorem taxation, when it has been removed from the
restricted lands and stored in the owner's tanks and the Indians
have no further interest in it. P. 326.
2. There is a recognized distinction between a non-discriminatory tax
upon the property of an agent of government, albeit the property
is used in, or has relation to, the business of the agency-where
there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the
functions of government-and a tax which is deemed to impose a
direct burden upon the exertion of governmental powers. P. 327.

CERTIORARI, 287 U. S. 594, to review judgments sustain-

ing state taxes on stored oil which had been extracted
under leases from restricted Indian allotments.

was on the brief, for petitioner.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE HUGHES

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
These cases present the question of the validity of
ad valorem taxes upon crude oil belonging to petitioner,
Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Company, and held by
it in its storage tanks in Tulsa County and Payne County,
Oklahoma. In each case, the tax was challenged upon
the ground that the oil was exempt because in its production petitioner was operating as an instrumentality of
the United States. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma
sustained the taxes 159 Okla. 15, 13 P. (2d) 585; 159
Okla. 6, 14 P. (2d) 929, and the cases come here on writs
of certiorari.
The facts are shown by agreed statements. The oil in
question was assessed under the general laws of the State
for annual ad valorem taxes as a part of the personal property of petitioner within the respective counties. It constituted petitioner's share of oil which petitioner had
produced from restricted Indian lands in Seminole
County, Oklahoma, under leases which had been approved
by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of
Congress of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312. In the Tulsa
County case (No. 356) the assessment was for the year

1929 and included 51,630 barrels of crude oil which had
been produced from the restricted lands above mentioned
during the period from March 31, 1927, to June 16, 1927.
This oil on production had been commingled with oil from
petitioner's " commercial" or unrestricted leasehold properties in Seminole County and had been immediately
piped into petitioner's storage tanks in Tulsa County
where it had remained. At the time of the removal of
the oil, petitioner paid to the Superintendent of the Five
Civilized Tribes for the lessors the agreed royalty of
121/2 per cent. of the gross proceeds, and the Indians
owned no part of the oil in storage on January 1, 1929,
the date of assessment, nor will they receive any part of
the proceeds when the oil is sold by petitioner. In the
Payne County case (No. 357) the question concerns
383,307 barrels of crude oil produced from the restricted
lands prior to January 1, 1928 (the assessment date) and
piped, with other oil, into petitioner's storage tanks in
Payne County and there held.
In Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U. S. 609, an ad
valorem tax upon ores mined under a lease of restricted
Indian land and in the bins on that land on the assessment date was held to be invalid. The tax "was assessed
on the ores in mass; and the royalties or equitable interests of the Indians had not been paid or segregated." Id.
p. 612. In these circumstances the tax was regarded as
an attempt to tax an agency of the federal government.
That decision is not controlling in the instant case. Here,
payment had been made for the share of the Indian lessors
and they had no further interest in the oil. It had been
commingled with other oil,-had been transported from the
restricted lands to petitioner's storage tanks in the taxing
counties, and was there held exclusively in the interest and
for the convenience of petitioner.

ment, albeit the property is used in, or has relation to, the
business of the agency-where there is only a remote, if
any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government-and a tax which is deemed to impose a direct
burden upon the exertion of governmental powers.

286 U. S. 123, 130; Broad River Power Co. v. Query, ante,
p. 178. In this instance, the tax is not on the oil leases
(Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240
U. S. 522, 530), or upon the privilege of extracting the oil
or upon the income derived therefrom. Choctaw, 0. & G.
R. Co. v. Harrison,235 U. S. 292, 298, 299; Gillespiev. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, 506. See Burnet v. Coronado Oil &
Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 399. Such immunity as petitioner
enjoyed as a governmental instrumentality inhered in its
operations as such, and being for the protection of the
Government in its function extended no farther than was
necessary for that purpose. The holding of the oil in
question, which had been segregated and withdrawn from
the restricted lands as petitioner's exclusive property,
awaiting disposition at petitioner's pleasure, was for its
sole advantage and cannot be said to be so identified with
its operations as a governmental instrumentality as to entitle it to exemption from the general property taxes imposed by the State in return for the protection the State
afforded. With respect to these taxes, this oil was in no
different case from that of the other oil of petitioner with
which it was commingled.
Judgments affirmed.
