places of business as the "off track" stations specified in
the contract, and the continued exclusive employment of
that company to render the stipulated service, both matters within the jurisdiction of the Commission. True, a
contract may precede and have existence apart from the
several acts required to perform it, and conceivably all
of those acts might be done if no contract or agreement
to perform them had ever existed. But when they are
done in performance of an agreement, there is no way
by which the agreement itself can be assailed by injunction except by restraining acts done in performance of
it. That, in this case, the statute forbids, not because the
contract is within the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, but because the acts done in performance of it, which must necessarily be enjoined if any
relief is given, are matters subject to the jurisdiction of
the Commission. See Wheeling & Lake Erie Ry. Co. v.

PUERTO RICO v. RUSSELL & CO.

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.

No. 492. Argued February 10, 13, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.

1. A sociedad en comandita under -the laws of Puerto Rico is not a
limited partnership in the common-law sense, but is a juridical
person with a personality like that of a corporation. P. 478.
2. A suit against a sociedad en comandita of Puerto Rico can not be
removed by its members from the Insular Court to the United
States District Court for Puerto Rico, under §§ 41 and 42 of the
Organic Act, upon the ground that the members are not citizens
of or domiciled in Puerto Rico. P. 482.
3. A suit by the People of Puerto Rico to recover insular taxes is
not to be classed as a suit arising under the laws of the United

Opinion of the Court.

States, within the meaning of the jurisdictional statutes governing
removal of causes, either (a) because authority to bring it comes
from an Act of Congress, or (b) because the plaintiff is recognized
as a political entity by the Act of Congress under which its
government is organized. Pp. 482, 484.
4. The doctrine that a suit by a corporation organized under an Act
of Congress is within the jurisdiction of the federal courts as a
suit arising under the laws of the United States, has been limited
by precedent and by Acts of Congress, and is not to be extended.

CERTIORARI, 287 U. S. 593, to review the affirmance of
a decree of the United States District Court for Puerto
Rico, dismissing on the merits a suit removed from the
Insular District Court.
Messrs. William Cattron Rigby and Fred W. Llewellyn,
with whom Messrs. Charles E. Winter, Attorney General
of Puerto Rico, and Blanton Winship were on the brief,
for petitioner.
Mr. Francis E. Neagle for respondents.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
The people of Puerto Rico, the petitioner, brought this
suit in the Insular District Court of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, against the respondent, Russell & Co., a sociedad
en comanditaorganized under the laws of Puerto Rico, to
recover certain assessments levied on lands of Russell &
Co., under an act of the legislature of Puerto Rico. The
individual respondents, members of the socledad, none
of whom are citizens of Puerto Rico or domiciled there,
were not named as defendants. They appeared specially
in the Insular Court and removed the cause to the United
States District Court for Puerto Rico. That court derried
a motion to remand and gave its decree for respondents
on the ground, first raised by the answer, that the assess-

ments sued for were levied in violation of § 2 of the
Organic Act of Puerto Rico, March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat.
951, forbidding the enactment of any law impairing the
obligation' of contract. On appeal the Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit affirmed, 60 F. (2d) 10; this Court
granted certiorari. 287 U. S. 593.
Section 41 of the Organic Act confers on the United
States District Court for Puerto Rico "jurisdiction of all
cases cognizable in the district courts of the United
States," and also "jurisdiction of all controversies where
all of the parties on either side of the controversy are
citizens of a foreign State or States, or citizens of a State
Territory or District of the United States not domiciled
in Puerto Rico, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds,
exclusive of interest or cost, the sum or value of $3,000."
By § 42 "the laws of the United States relating to . . .
removal of causes, and other matters or proceedings as between the courts of the United States and the courts of
the several States, shall govern in such matters and proceedings as between the district court of the United States
and the courts of Porto Rico . . ." Thus suits arising
under the Constitution or laws of the United States are
within the jurisdiction of the District Court for Puerto
Rico (§ 24, Judicial Code; 28 U. S. C., § 41), and civil
suits begun in the Insular Court over which the federal
court has original jurisdiction may be removed in accordance with the provisions of § 28 of the Judicial Code
(28 U. S. C., § 71).
Admittedly, if the individual members of the sociedad
are "parties" within the meaning of the Organic Act,
§ 41, supra, the suit is one within the jurisdiction of the
District Court because of their nonresidence, diversity of
citizenship being unnecessary. See Porto Rico Ry. Light
& Power Co. v. Mor, 253 U. S. 345. And if the nonresidence of the individual members would confer jurisdiction upon the federal court in a suit against the sociedad

Opinion of 'the Court.

originally instituted there, we will assume, for present
purposes, that it would also suffice to justify removal by
the individuals, even though the Insular Court refuses to
recognize them as parties. Compare McLaughlin Bros.
v. Hallowell, 228 U. S. 278, 290. The petitioner argues,
nevertheless, that. the suit was not removable because of
citizenship for the reason that the sociedad is a juridical
entity under Puerto Rican law and, as in the case of a
corporation, its domicil rather than that of its members
determines citizenship for purposes of federal jurisdiction. If the petitioner's contention is sound, the District
Court was without jurisdiction unless the suit was, as the
respondents argue, one arising under the laws of the
United States. The questions raised by these contentions
must therefore first be answered.
For almost a century, in ascertaining whether there is
the requisite diversity of citizenship to confer jurisdiction
on the federal courts, we have looked to the domicil of a
corporation, not that of its individual stockholders, as
controlling. Louisville, C. & C. R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How.
497; Rundle v. Delaware & Raritan Canal Co., 14 How.
80; Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314;
Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404; Covington Drawbridge Co. v. Shepherd, 20 How, 227; St. Louis
& San FranciscoRy. Co. v. James, 161 U. S. 545; Patch v.
Wabash R. Co., 207 U. S. 277. In its final form this rule
of jurisdiction was stated in terms of a " conclusive presumption " that the stockholders are citizens of the state
of the corporate domicil, see Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio
R. Co., supra, 328; Covington Drawbridge Co. v. Shepherd, supra, 233; St. Louis & San Francisco Ry. Co., v.
James, supra, 554, but even those who formulated the
rule found its theoretical justification only in the complete legal personality with which corporations are endowed. Fictitious that personality may be, in the sense
that the fact that the corporation is composed of a plu-

rality of individuals, themselves legal persons, is disregarded, but "it is a fiction created by law with intent
that it should be acted on as if true." Klein v. Board of
Supervisors, 282 U. S. 19, 24. This treatment of the
aggregate for other purposes as a person distinct from its
members, with capacity to perform all legal acts, made it
possible and convenient to treat it so for purposes of federal jurisdiction as well. But status as a unit for purposes
of suit alone, as in the case of a joint stock company, see
Chapman v. Barney, 129 U. S. 677, 682; Levering &
GarriguesCo. v. Morrin, 61 F. (2d) 115, 117, or a limited
partnership, not shown to have the other attributes of a
corporation, Great Southern Fireproof Hotel Co. v. Jones,
177 U. S. 449 (compare Thomas v. Board of Trustees, 195
U. S. 207) has been deemed a legal personality too incomplete; what was but an association of individuals for so
many ends and a juridical entity for only a few, was not
easily to be treated as if it were a single citizen.
The tradition of the common law is to treat as legal
persons only incorporated groups and to assimilate all
others to partnerships. Chapman v. Barney, supra; Great
Southern FireproofHotel Co. v. Jones, supra. The tradition of the civil law, as expressed in the Code. of Puerto
Rico, is otherwise. 1 Therefore to call the sociedad en
'Compare the decision of the United States and Chilean Claims
Commission, established by virtue of the Convention of May 24, 1897,
in Chauncey v. The Republic of Chile, No. 3, that a claim by a society
en comandita, organized by citizens of the United States under Chilean
law was not a claim by "corporations, companies or private individuals, citizens of the United States." And see Pie, Soci6t6s Commerciales (2d ed. 1925), v. 1, pp. 107, 118, 137, 194, 216; Lastig, Die

PUERTO RICO v. RUSSELL & CO.

Opinion of the Court.

comandita a limited partnership in the common law sense,
as the respondents and others have done, is to invoke a
false analogy. In the law of its creation the sociedad is
consistently regarded as a juridical person. It may contract, own property and transact business, sue and be sued
in its own name and right. Civil Code (1930), §§ 27 to
30; Code of Commerce (1930), §§ 95, 97, 123, 124. Its
members are not thought to have a sufficient personal interest in a suit brought against the entity to entitle them
to intervene as parties defendant. See People v. Rivera
Zayas, 29 P. R. 423, 430. It is created by articles of association filed as public records. Code of Commerce, §§ 95,
98; compare Civil Code, §§ 1558, 1560. Where the articles so provide, the sociedad endures for a period prescribed by them regardless of the death or withdrawal of
individual members. Civil Code, §§ 1591, 1596, 1598;
Code of Commerce, § 141. Powers of management may
be vested in managers designated by the articles from
among the members whose participation is unlimited, and
they alone may perform acts legally binding on the
sociedad. Civil Code, §§ 1583, 1589; Code of Commerce,
§§ 102, 106, 125. Its members are not primarily liable for
its acts and debts (Code of Commerce, § 156), and its
creditors are preferred with respect to its assets and property over the creditors of individual members, although
the latter may reach the interests of the individual members in the common capital. Civil Code, § 1590; see
Quintana Bros. & Co. v. S. Ramirez & Co., 22 P. R. 707,
716. Although the members whose participation is unlimited are made contingently liable for the debts of the
sociedad in the event that its assets are insufficient to
satisfy them (Code of Commerce, §§ 125, 156; see Successors of M. Lamadrid& Co. v. Torrens, Martorefl & Co.,
28 P. R. 824), this liability is of no more consequence for
present purposes than that imposed on corporate stockholders by the statutes of some states. Compare Louis-

ville, C. & C. R., Co. v. Letson, supra, 557, 558; Liverpool
Insurance Co. v. Massachusetts, 10 Wall. 566, 575. These
characteristics under the Codes of Puerto Rico give content to their declaration that the sociedad is a juridical
person. That personality is so complete in contemplation of the law of Puerto Rico that we see no adequate
reason for holding that the sociedad has a different status
for purposes of federal jurisdiction than a corporation
organized under that law. In neither case may nonresidents of Puerto Rico, who have taken advantage of its
laws to organize a juridical entity for the purpose of
carrying on business there, remove from the Insular
Courts controversies arising under local law.
Respondents' contention that the suit is one arising
under the laws of the United States, and therefore removable, irrespective of the citizenship of the defendant, rests
upon two grounds: first, that the suit was brought pursuant to an Act of Congress of April 23, 1928, 45 Stat. 447,
and, second, that the plaintiff in the District Court, The
People of Puerto Rico, derives its power as a sovereign
political entity from the Organic Act, under which the
Insular government was organized.
The Act of Congress first mentioned was adopted as a
result of earlier litigation with respect to the present tax.
Respondent and others originally brought suits in the
Federal District Court of Puerto Rico to enjoin collection
of the tax, pending which, Congress, by Act of March 4,
1927, 44 Stat. 1421, forbade the maintenance of any suit
in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico to
restrain the collection of any tax imposed by the laws of
Puerto Rico. Following that prohibition, this Court, in
Smallwood v. Gallardo, 275 U. S. 56, held that all such
injunction cases then pending in the federal courts, were
abated by the statute and the suit brought by respondents
was accordingly dismissed. Gallardo v. Havemeyer, 21 F.
(2d) 1012. Subsequently, Congress passed the law of

PUERTO RICO v. RUSSELL & CO.
476

Opinion of the Court.

April 23, 1928, by which it was provided that in cases
where the taxpayer had by such suits obtained an injunction restraining collection of the tax, the Treasurer of
Puerto Rico should "enforce the collectio:i of the tax so
enjoined . . . by a suit at law instead of by attachment,
embargo, distraint or any other form of summary administrative proceeding . . ." Respondents argue that as the
authority to recover the tax by suit rather than by attachment or other summary method was conferred by act of
Congress,. the suit is one arising under the laws of the
United States.
We do not stop to examine the answering contention of
petitioner that the Act of Congress was not an enabling
act, but operated only to preclude resort by the Insular
government to the summary remedies otherwise available
for the collection of the tax. For we think that even
though petitioner derived its authority to maintain the
suit from the Act of Congress, it did not arise under the
laws of the United States within the meaning of the
jurisdictional statutes.
The suit was brought to recover assessments levied
under the Act of the Puerto Rican legislature, but not to
enforce a right created by a law of the United States. No
question of interpretation or enforcement of the federal
statute appears upon the face of the complaint. Federal
jurisdiction may be invoked to vindicate a right or privilege claimed under -a federal statute. It may not be invoked where the right asserted is non-federal, merely
because the plaintiff's right to sue is derived from federal
law, or because the property involved was obtained under
federal statute. The federal nature of the right to be
established is decisive-not the source of the authority to
establish it. Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S.
505; Blackburn v. Portland Gold Mining Co., 175 U. S.
571; Gold-Washing & Water Co. v. Keyes, 96 U. S. 199,
203; see McGoon v. Northern Pacific Ry. Co., 204 Fed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

998, 1001; compare Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487.
The case is analogous to those involving rights to land
granted under laws or treaties of the United States.
Where the complaint shows only that such was the source
of the plaintiff's title, the case is not one within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Barnett v. Kunkel, 264
U. S. 16, 20; Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561; Devine
v. Los Angeles, 202 U. S. 313, 337; compare Hopkins v.
Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 489; Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co.,
241 U. S. 551; Wilson Cypress Co. v. Del Pozo, 236 U. S.
635, 643; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Soderberg, 188
U. S. 526.
For similar reasons the case stands in no different aspect because The People of Puerto Rico is a political
entity, recognized as such by the Act of Congress under
which its government is organized. A state brought into
the federal Union by act of Congress is likewise a political
entity, and although not a citizen of the United States
within the meaning of the statutes conferring jurisdiction
on federal courts, Stone v. South Carolina,117 U. S. 430;
Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Alabama, 155 U. S. 482;
see Arkansas v. Kansas & Texas Coal Co., 183 U. S. 185, a
suit brought by it presenting a federal question is within
the jurisdiction of the district courts. Railroad Co. v.
Mississippi, 102 U. S. 135, 140; Ames v. Kansas, 111 U. S.
449; Southern Pacific R. Co. v. California,118 U. S. 109.
But, a suit does not arise under the Constitution or laws
of the United States merely because a state is the plaintiff, though the state derives its authority to maintain
the suit from the Federal Constitution and laws. Postal
Telegraph Cable Co. v. Alabama, supra, 487; Minnesota
v. Northern Securities Co., 194 U. S. 48; Germania Insurance Co. v. Wisconsin, 119 U. S. 473, 475; Arkansas v.

We do not overlook the point that a suit by a corporation organized under an act of Congress has been held to
be within the jurisdiction of the federal courts as one
arising under the laws of the United States. Osborn v.
Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738; Pacific Railroad
Removal Cases, 115 U. S. 1. Whether or not- these cases
are distinguishable from others on the ground, usually
urged in their support, that a corporation has no powers
and can incur no obligations except as authorized by federal law, Osborn v. The Bank, supra, 823; see Pacific Railroad Removal Cases, supra, 13, their doctrine has not
been extended to other classes of cases and has been
restricted by successive statutes (Act of July 12, 1882,
c. 290, § 4, 22 Stat. 162, 163, 28 U. S. C. A., § 41 (16);
Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, § 5, 38 Stat. 803, 804; Act
of February 13, 1925, c. 229, § 12, 43 Stat. 936, 941, 28
U. S. C. A., § 42), the last of which limits it to cases of
government owned corporations alone. We should fly in
the face of this legislative policy and disregard precedents
which we think controlling were we to extend the doctrine
now.
The judgment below will be reversed and the cause
remanded with instructions to remand it to the Insular
Court from which it was removed.
