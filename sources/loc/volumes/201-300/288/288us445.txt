action at law for the damages resulting from the death, and a lien
on the vessel.
Held that the cause of action was enforceable in admiralty in rem
against the vessel. P. 447.
60 F. (2d) 793, affirmed.

CERTIORARI,

Mr. Erskine Wood for petitioner.
The Oregon "death statute," under which the suit
was brought, is not a "survival act," and no right of
action arises under it until death actually occurs. Death
occurring, the right which the injured man had dies with
him, and a new, distinct and different cause of action
arises in the person of his administrator for the benefit
of his estate. Since in this case that new cause of action
arose on land death occurring ashore), and the tort and
damages were thus consummated there, the admiralty
court was without jurisdiction. Hughes, Admiralty, 2d

The proceeding, being in rem, must rest upon a maritime lien or hypothecation. A maritime lien is "stricti
juris and can not be extended by construction, analogy
or inference." Osaka Shosen Kaisha v. Pacific Export
Lumber Co., 260 U. S. 490.
Mr. Arthur I. Moulton submitted for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner is the owner of the steamship City of Vancouver. December 1, 1929, she was at Westport, Oregon,
in navigable waters of the Columbia taking on a cargo
of lumber. Respondent's intestate was employed by contracting stevedores who were loading her. While upon
the deck of the ship helping in that work he was struck
by a falling sling-load of lumber and mortally injured.
He was taken ashore where he died an hour later. Respondent was appointed his administratrix and, electing
under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U. S. C., ยง 933) to assert her claim
against a third party, filed a libel in admiralty in the
district court of Oregon against the ship, claiming on
'behalf of his estate damages in the sum of $10,000. The
libel alleged in substance that intestate's death was caused
by reason of petitioner's negligence in respect of the ship's
winch which was being used to hoist the lumber.

VANCOUVER S. S. CO. v. RICE.
445

Opinion of the Court.

Petitioner excepted to the libel, asserting that the cause
of action arose on land and not upon the water and that
therefore the case is not within the admiralty jurisdiction.
The district court so held and dismissed the libel. The
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 60 F. (2d) 793.
The Oregon statute creating a cause of action for death
by wrongful act provides: "When the death of a person
is caused by the wrongful act or omission of another, the
personal representatives of the former may maintain an
action at law therefor against -the latter, if the former
might have maintained an action, had he lived, against
the latter, for an injury done by the same act or omission."
Oregon Code (1930), ยง 5-703. And the Oregon Boat Lien
Law declares that every boat or vessel shall be subject to
a lien "for damages or injuries [done] by such boat or
vessel resulting in the death of any person." ยง 51-601.
Admiralty courts have jurisdiction to enforce such liens.
The Corsair, 145 U. S.335, 347. The Anglo-Patagonian,
235 Fed. 92, 94.
The libel alleges no cause of action that accrued to the
deceased. The only cause of action here involved is that
created by the Oregon statute and it did not arise until
the intestate died. The sole question is whether the happening of the fatal event upon navigable waters gave the
admiralty court jurisdiction notwithstanding death occurred on land. The right to recover for death depends
upon the law of the place of the act or omission that
caused. it and not upon that of the place where death
occurred. Van Doren v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 93 Fed.

of cargo and knocked into the water where he died, this
court held that the state compensation act and not the
maritime law governed. Smith & Son v. Taylor, 276
U. S. 179. Defendant conceded that the state law would
apply if the deceased had been killed on the land. But
it argued that as no claim was made for injuries there
sustained and as the suit was solely for death, the case
was exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. We
said (p. 182): " But this is a partial view that cannot be
sustained. The blow by the sling was what gave rise to
the cause of action. It was given and took effect while
deceased was upon the land. It was the sole, immediate
and proximate cause of his death." Mutatis mutandis,
what was there said is applicable here.
The substance and consummation of the occurrence
which resulted in intestate's death and so gave rise to
respondent's cause of action took place on the deck of the
ship lyirng in navigable waters. The damages allowed by
the Oregon statute are those resulting solely from the
death. The foundation of the right to recover is a wrongful act or omission taking effect aboard the ship and
resulting in death upon the land. This is a maritime tort,
and upon it the respondent's claim rests. The admiralty
court has jurisdiction. The Chiswick, 231 Fed. 452. The
