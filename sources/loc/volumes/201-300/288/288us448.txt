of cargo and knocked into the water where he died, this
court held that the state compensation act and not the
maritime law governed. Smith & Son v. Taylor, 276
U. S. 179. Defendant conceded that the state law would
apply if the deceased had been killed on the land. But
it argued that as no claim was made for injuries there
sustained and as the suit was solely for death, the case
was exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. We
said (p. 182): " But this is a partial view that cannot be
sustained. The blow by the sling was what gave rise to
the cause of action. It was given and took effect while
deceased was upon the land. It was the sole, immediate
and proximate cause of his death." Mutatis mutandis,
what was there said is applicable here.
The substance and consummation of the occurrence
which resulted in intestate's death and so gave rise to
respondent's cause of action took place on the deck of the
ship lyirng in navigable waters. The damages allowed by
the Oregon statute are those resulting solely from the
death. The foundation of the right to recover is a wrongful act or omission taking effect aboard the ship and
resulting in death upon the land. This is a maritime tort,
and upon it the respondent's claim rests. The admiralty
court has jurisdiction. The Chiswick, 231 Fed. 452. The

tion in time of shortage, which does not challenge the reasonableness
or validity of the rule itself, may be maintained under § 9 of the
Interstate Commerce Act without action or finding by the Commission. P. 455.
2. But if the shipper elects, under § 9, to proceed first before the
Commission and secures an order for reparation which he sues to
enforce under § 16 (2), he is bound by the Commission's award and
can not claim more upon the ground that the Commission erred
as a matter of law in reducing damages. P. 456.
3. The fact that the Act merely makes the findings and report of
the Commission prima facie evid(nce, and so preserves the defendant's right to contest the award, gives no support to the contention that the award does not bind the plaintiff. P. 458.
4. Facts alleged held sufficient to show unlawful discrimination in
distribution of coal cars and sufficient to sustain judgment for the
amount of the award together with interest, costs and a reasonable

Here, acting in its administrative capacity, the Commission found that petitioners' acts and practices were
unlawful. It also laid down the standard of service that
should have prevailed. But pursuant to the further hear-

ing granted for the sole purpose of determining the
amount of respondent's damages on the basis of this
standard, the Commission proceeded to treat as lawful
the very "offer" which, in its administrative capacity, it
had found unlawful because it was arbitrary and made
without regard to the requirements of. respondent's
business.
A finding made by the Commission without evidence,
or contrary to the indisputable character of the evidence,
is void. Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Louisville &
N. R. Co., 227 U. S. 88, 91-2; Interstate Commerce
Comm'n v. Union Pacific R. Co., 222 U. S. 541, 547-8.
The claim is not for a penalty but for compensation, "a property right." Spiller v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co.,
252 U. S. 117, 135. By requiring the injured shipper to
elect between two remedies, Congress clearly intended
that each of the two was to comprehend whatever measures are necessary to secure recovery of the statutory
standard of full compensation. Each was to be as adequate and complete as the other, and its equal in,final
results. This is so because the fundamental principles
of equality (the "primary purpose of the Act," Atchison,
T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Robinson, 233 U. S. 173, 181) and
uniformity (the "paramount purpose of the Commerce
Act," Great Northern R. Co. v. Merchants Elevator Co.,
259 U. S. 285, 290) permeate § 9 no less than the other
provisions. Pursuant to this view, this Court has held
that whether complaint is filed with the Commission or
suit is brought in court, the same period of limitation
applies (Phillips Co. v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 236 U. S.
662, 667); the cause of action accrues at the same time
(U. S. ex rel. Louisville C. Co. v. Interstate Commerce
Com m'n, 246 U. S. 638, 644); the same starting basis, a
finding by the Commission on the administrative question, is required (Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Abilene Cotton

Argument for Respondent.

Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426, 436-7, 441-2, 446); and the same
rules of law prevail,-" the' rule of damages in one hardly
can be different from that proper for the other." Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., 242 U. S. 288, 291.
But to make certain that both methods of procedure
will be controlled by the same rules of law and hence
culminate in like final results, they must be construed as
subject also to the same judicial machinery for correcting
errors and mistakes.
The suit under § 16 (2) is an adjunct of the "method
of procedure" before the Commission referred to in § 9,
and part and parcel of that particular "remedy." It is a
trial de novo of the action with the same corrective function, scope and power as the new trial in the alternative
method of procedure in a District Court.
The suit is not on the award, as such. Lewis-SimasJones Co. v. SouthernPacific Co., 283 U. S. 654, 661. It is
for damages actually, incurred by the plaintiff. The Commission's findings and order are available as evidence. If
they were regularly and properly promulgated (and it is
so presumed until the contrary appears), they are conclusive so far as they determine the administrative questions, if any, in the case, but only prima facie correct so
far as they determine the fact and amount of damages.
Mitchell Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 230 U. S. 247,
257-8. The plaintiff may show that the Commission
erred in its mathematical calculations, in the formula used
in arriving at the amount, and in the application of rules
of law. Meeker v. Lehigh Valley-R. Co., 236 U. S. 412,
430.
In the § 16 (2) phase of the alternative method of
procedure, which "suit shall proceed in all respects like
other civil suits," the Commission's report and order
on amount of damages is like an auditor's report. Cf.
Matter of Walter Peterson, 253 U. S. 300, 311.

Argument for Itespondent.

288 US.

The § 16 (2) right of further procedure in a federal
or state court is not the § 9 right of initial procedure in
a federal court. The § 16 (2) suit per se is not either
of the § 9 methods of procedure; it is merely supplemental
to one of them and that one the method initiated by
complaint to the Commission. Each method is the equal
of the other in final results. Pennsylvania R. Co. v.
Clark Bros. Co., 238 U. S. 456, 472; Standard Oil Co. v.
United States, 283 U. S. 236, 241.
While this Court has never directly and specifically
decided the precise question here involved, it has sustained in one case a greater recovery than the Commission's award correctly computed, and has clearly intimated in other cases that the shipper's right of action
and the District Court's jurisdiction are not limited in
maximum amount to the Commission's award. Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Jacoby Co., 242 U. S. 89, 99; Pennsylvania
R. Co. v. Weber, 257 U. S. 85, 90-1. See Pennsylvania R.
Co. v. Clark Bros. Co., 238 U. S. 456, 472-3; Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Minds, 250 U. S. 368, 371-5; Louisville &
N. R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., 242 U. S. 288, 291.
If the administrative determination is delayed beyond
the two-year period for bringing suit, the shipper must
recover his damages before the Commission or not at all.
A construction of § 16 (2) that in such cases the shipper
is limited to the awai'd, even though the amount was
arrived at by error of law or mathematical computations,
would be manifestly unjust.
Respondent was deprived of his right to a voluntary
election of § 9 remedies in this case. He was compelled
to proceed for damages before the Commission or not at
all.
There is no implication in the decisions of this Court
that a reparation order less in amount than the sum
claimed is, as to the diminution, an unreviewable nega-

Section 16 (3f) merely limits the time within which

of, a greater amount than the Commission's award, are

MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is an action brought by respondent in the federal
district court for northern West Virginia against petitioners in consequence of their failure to comply with a
reparation order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
It directed them to pay to plaintiff $12,838.31 damages
found to have been sustained by reason of undue prejudice
to which they had subjected him in respect of furnishing
cars for the transportation of coal from his mine. He
sought judgment for $57,735.11 together with interest,
costs and an attorney's fee. Defendants demurred to the
complaint generally and also specifically upon the ground.
that plaintiff was not entitled to recover more than the
award. The demurrers were overruled and, issue having
been joined, there was a trial by jury which resulted in a
verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff for $63,048.60,
not including attorney's fee, as to which all questions were
reserved. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 61 F.

OCTOBER TERM, 1932.
Opinion of the Court.

288 U.S.

There is no bill of exceptions,' and' we are called on to
decide whether the facts alleged in the complaint, of
which the reports and order of the Commission are a part,
are sufficient to sustain the judgment. The substance of
plaintiff's claim as thus shown is as follows:
Between October 14, 1922, and April 1, 1923, he operated a coal mine on a branch of the Baltimore & Ohio
railroad over which the Western Maryland had trackage
rights. His mine was located between two mines operated
by a competitor and served by both defendants. During
that period there was a shortage of coal cars.
For the rating of, and the distribution of coal cars
among, mines on their respective lines, each of the
defendants established and maintained in force certain
rules and regulations. These required that during periods
of coal-car shortage the cars available for loading should
be distributed pro rata among the mines in accordance
with their ratings. They also permitted the operator of
"any mine reached by two railroads to order 100 per cent
or less of its rating from either of the said railroads, or to
divide the orders between the two railroads in any way
which the judgment of the operator dictated, provided
the combined orders did not exceed 100 per cent of the
rating of the mine; and the mine was entitled to receive
its pro rata share of the available cars on the basis of such
orders and to ship the coal loaded therein via the railroad
which furnished the cars."
The Baltimore & Ohio furnished a smaller percentage
of cars ordered than did the Western Maryland. Plaintiff's mine was being served exclusively by the former.
Desiring to be served by the latter, he regularly ordered

from it 100 per-cent. of his rating but with a single exception was furnished no cars. He complained to the defendants and was informed that his competitor was ordering
20 per cent. from the Baltimore & Ohio and 80 per cent.
from the Western Maryland and that such a division of
his orders would be acceptable to them. He rejected the
offer, claiming the right to order from either or both as
from time to time he might see fit. But he was denied
the right so given his competitor.
He complained to the Commissioi that defendants thus
subjected him to undue prejudice. The Commission so
found.' And it held the case open to permit him to file
a petition for further hearing as to the amount of damages, if any, sustained by him. 112 I. C. C. 244. And see
102 I. C. C. 19. Plaintiff upon such hearing claimed that
the cost of mining the coal that he shipped had been
increased $9,283.14 and that his loss of profits was
$48,451.97, making a total of $57,735.11. Defendants
while denying liability did not controvert these figures.
The Commission found that if plaintiff had accepted
defendant's offer his increased mining costs would have
been only $2,225.49 and his loss of profits but $10,612.82,
making in all $12,838.31, and that he was entitled to
reparation in that amount together with interest. It
directed that, within 60 days, defendants pay that sum.

fendants' offer. It asserts that the reduction of his claim
upon that ground was beyond the power of the Commission and therefore null and void.8
The Interstate Commerce Act declares it unlawful for
a carrier to subject any person or traffic to any undue
or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage (§ 3) and imposes upon carriers liability for the full amount of damages sustained by any person in consequence of any such
violation of the Act. § 8. A person so injured may either
make complaint to the Commission or bring suit for damages in a district court; but he shall not have the right to
pursue both remedies, and must elect which method he
will adopt. § 9. If the Commission shall determine that
complainant is entitled to an award of damages it shall
make an order directing the carrier to pay to him the sum
to which he is entitled on or before a day named. § 16
(1). If the carr'er does not comply with such order, the
complainant may file in the United States district court
or in any state court a petition "setting forth briefly the
causes for which he claims damages, and the order of the
commission in the premises. Stch suit in the district
court of the United States shall proceed in all respects
like other civil suits for damages, except that on the trial
of such suit the findings and order of the commission shall
be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated."
§ 16 (2).
Questions as to the reasonableness of rules and regulations governing the distribution of coal cars in periods
of shortage are for the Commission. And until found
unreasonable by it, a shipper may not maintain an action
in any court against a carrier upon the claim that any
such rule or regulation was unreasonable and that through

its enforcement he sustained loss or damage. Morrisdale
Coal Co. v. Penna. R. Co., 30 U. S. 304, 313. But if the
rule, regulation or practice of the carrier is not attacked
and the shipper's claim is grounded upon its violation or
discriminatory enforcement, there is no administrative
question involved. In such cases the court is required
merely to decide whether the carrier has departed from its
established standard. The decision does not concern the
reasonableness or validity of the rule itself and it has no
tendency against uniformity or other purpose of the Act.
Suits for damages upon such grounds may be prosecuted
without action or finding by the Commission. Penna.
R. Co. v. Puritan Coal Co., 237 U. S. 121, 131-134. I1.
Cent. R. Co. v. Mulberry Coal Co., 238 U. S. 275, 282-283.
Penna.R. Co. v. Sonman Coal Co., 242 U. S. 120, 124.
The facts stated in the complaint clearly show that
there was no question in this case requiring the exercise
of the Commission's administrative powers. Plaintiff's
mine was in the same class as the mines of its competitor.
It was entitled to have a supply of cars from either or
both defendants as it saw fit. Cf. United States v. New
River Co., 265 U. S. 533, 542. His claim for damages does
not rest upon defendants' adherence to or enforcement of
their rule but upon their refusal to furnish him cars in
accordance with the rule. Therefore, without any prior
action on the part of the Commission, plaintiff was entitled under §§ 8 and 9 to maintain an action at law for
the full affiount of damages sustained by him on account
of the undue prejudice to which he claims to have been
subjected by defendants.
But having elected to seek relief through the Commission, plaintiff is not entitled to recover more than the
amount of the award.
This is not a suit authorized by § 9 but one brought
under § 16 (2) because of defendants' refusal to comply
with the Commission's order. Subject to the right of

contestation preserved by the Act (Meeker v. Lehigh
Valley R. Co., 236 U. S. 412, 430) it is a suit for the
enforcement of the award. § 16 (3) (f). Lewis-SimasJones Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., 283 U. S. 654, 661.
Section 16 (2) does not permit suit in the absence of an
award, and if the Commission denies him relief, a claimant is remediless. Standard Oil Co. v. United States,
283 U. S. 235. Brady v. United States, 283 U. S. 804.
Bartlesville Zinc Co. v. Mellon, 56 F. (2d) 154. No suit
is permitted if the carrier pays the award. Louisville &
N. R. Co. v. Ohio Valley Tie Co., 242 U. S. 288. Cf. Penna.
R. Co. v. Clark Coal Co., 238 U. S. 456. Plaintiff may
not adopt the award as the basis of his suit and then
attack it. Cf. Mitchell Coal Co. v. Penna. R. Co., 230
U. S. 247, 258.
The fact that the Act merely makes the findings and
report of the Commission prima facie evidence and so
preserves the defendant's right to contest the award gives
no support to plaintiff's contention that it does not bind
him. It is to be remembered that, by electing to call on
the Commission for the determination of his damages,
plaintiff waived his right to maintain an action at law
upon his claim. But the carriers made no such election.
Undoubtedly it was to the end that they be not denied
the right of trial by jury that Congress saved their right
to be heard in court upon the merits of claims asserted
against them. The right of election given to a claimant
reasonably may have been deemed an adequate ground
for making the Commission's award final as to him. Confessedly, it is final save when carriers refuse to pay within
the time allowed. If by such a suit plaintiff may obtain
a trial de novo or a revision of the award, the provisions
of § 9 requiring election and prohibiting pursuit of both
remedies would be set at naught in cases in which carriers refuse to pay and would be given effect in all other
cases. There is no support for such a distinction. The

construction for which plaintiff contends cannot be
sustained. He is bound by the award.
Defendants insist that plaintiff not only was limited in
recovery by the amount of the award but that he suffered no discrimination. The latter contention is without merit. The allegations of the complaint comply with
the requirements of § 16 (2) and are clearly sufficient to
sustain a judgment against the defendants for the amount
of the award together with interest, costs and a reasonable
attorney's fee to be taxed and collected as a part of the
costs of the suit.
The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is
reversed. The case is remanded to the district court for
proceedings in accordance with this opinion.

UNITED STATES v. DAKOTA-MONTANA OIL CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 434.

Argued February 8, 1933.-Decided March 13, 1933.

Section 234 (a) (8) of the Revenue Act of 1926, provides that, in
the case of oil wells, the taxpayer shall have, as a deduction from
gross income, "a reasonable allowance for depletion and for depreciation of improvements, according to the peculiar conditions of
each case," to be made under departmental rules and regulations.
Section 204 permits the taxpayer to calculate depletion on the basis
of cost alone, or else to deduct an arbitrary allowance, fixed by
the statute, without reference to cost or discovery value, at 27'%
of gross income from the well. Held, construing these in the light
of earlier provisions and administrative construction, that the capitalized cost of drilling, as distinguished from cost of physical property such as machinery, tools, equipment, pipes, etc., is subject to
depletion allowance and not to depreciation allowance. Pp. 460,
