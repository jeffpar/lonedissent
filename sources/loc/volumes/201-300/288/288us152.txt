SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 163.

FOR THE

Argued December 13, 1932.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. Where one corporation has legally enforceable control of substantially all of the stock of another, the two are " affiliated" and must

make a consolidated return, under § 1331, Revenue Act of 1921,
and § 240, Revenue Act of 1918. P. 153.
2. In determining whether the control is of substantially all of the
stock, there is no ground for excluding preferred stock outstanding
with voting rights, even though it be redeemable at any time and
have a limited interest in dividends. P. 154.
3. Ownership by the one corporation of all the common stock and
none of the preferred stock of the other, giving control of only 77%
of all stock outstanding, held insufficient for affiliation. P. 156.
57 F. (2d) 186, affirmed.

delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The question presented is whether the petitioner, Atlantic City Electric Company, was affiliated with the
American Gas and Electric Company so that the federal
taxes for 1917, 1918, and 1919 should be determined upon
the basis of consolidated returns under § 1331 of the Reve-

Opinion of the Court.

nue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 319), as applicable to the year
1917, and § 240 of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1081,
1082). The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the order
of the Board of Tax Appeals (15 B. T. A. 1084), upheld
the ruling of the Commissioner that the corporations were
not affiliated and must make separate returns. 57 F.
(2d) 186. The case comes here on certiorari.
The following facts were found by the Board of Tax
Appeals: The petitioner, Atlantic City Electric Company, is a public service corporation. During -the years
in question, it had outstanding 12,500 shares of common
stock, of the par value of $100 per share, and 3702 shares
of preferred stock. Holders of preferred stock" were entitled to vote and that stock was preferred to the extent
of an annual cumulative dividend of six per cent. and on
final liquidation. The preferred stock was redeemable at
any time and had no interest in dividends except as above
stated. The American Gas and Electric Company was a
holding company. It owned all the common stock of the
Atlantic City Electric Company and none of its preferred
stock. 655 to 761 shares of that preferred stock were
owned by stockholders of the American Gas and Electric
Company, but the finding is that the control exercised by
that Company resulted "from its absolute ownership of
the entire common stock of its subsidiaries and not from
control or ownership of preferred stock by its stockholders." Of the total outstanding stock of the Atlantic City
Electric Company, preferred and common, the American
Gas and Electric Company owned approximately 77 per
cent.
With respect to control of stock, as creating the affiliation which affords a basis for a consolidated return, § 1331
of the Revenue Act of 1921 is to the same effect as § 240
of the Revenue Act of 1918. The requirement of control, in the absence of legal title or beneficial ownership,
is not *satisfied by acquiescence or by business considera-

tions without binding force.

There must be a control

that is legally enforceable. Handy & Harman v. Burnet,

284 U. S. 136, 140, 141. And it must be control of "substantially all the stock." In Handy & Harman v. Burnet,
supra, legally enforceable control of somewhat more than
75 per cent. of the stock was held to be insufficient. The
question, then, is whether in the instant case the entire
voting stock, preferred and common, should be considered
in determining whether there was affiliation, or the common stock alone.
The purpose of the Congress was to secure substantial
equality among stockholders who ultimately bear the
burden of taxation and to prevent evasion through the
manipulation of intercompany transactions. Handy &
Harman v. Burnet, supra. See, also, Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Mfg. Co., 287 U. S.544. The requirement of

consolidated returns was "based upon the principle of
levying the tax according to the true net income and
invested capital of a single business enterprise, even
though the business is operated through more than one
corporation." Treasury Regulations No. 45, Art. 631.1
'Article 631 of Regulations No. 45 is as follows:
"Affiliated corporations.-The provision of the statute requiring
affiliated corporations to file consolidated returns is based upon the
principle of levying the tax according to the true net income and invested capital of a single business enterprise, even though the business
is operated through more than one corporation. Where one corporation owns the capital stock of another corporation or other corporations, or where the stock of two or more corporations is owned by the
same interests, a situation results which is closely analogous to that
of a business maintaining one or more branch establishments. In the
latter case, because of the direct ownership of the property, the invested capital and net income of the branch form a part of the invested capital and net income of the entire organization. Where such
branches or units of a business are owned and controlled.through the
medium of separate corporations, it is necessary to require a consolidated return in order that the invested capital and net income of the
entire group may be accurately determined. Otherwise opportunity

Opinion of the Court.

In establishing ownership or control of substantially all
the stock as the criterion of a business unit, the statute
made no distinction between preferred and common stock.
It referred simply to "stock" and we perceive no ground
upon which stock with voting right can be treated as
excepted. The Treasury Regulations under the Revenue
Act of 1918 regarded the statutory requirement as relating to the "outstanding -,oting capital stock (not including stock in the treasury) at the beginning of and during
the taxable year." Regulations No. 45, Art. 633. The
same construction was given by the Department to the
corresponding provision of the Revenue Act of 1921.
Regulations No. 62, Art. 633. The Congress, in the
Revenue Act of 1924, embodied this construction in the
statute itself.2 § 240 (c) (1), 43 Stat. 288. See, also,
Revenue Act of 1926, § 240 (c) (d), 44 Stat. 46; Revenue
Act of 1928, § 141 (d), 45 Stat. 831; Revenue Act of
1932, § 141 (d), 47 Stat. 213. Compare Schlafly v.
United States, 4 F. (2d) 195, 200; Ice Service Co. v. Commissioner, 30 F. (2d) 230, 231; United States v. Cleveland, P. & E. R. Co., 42 F. (2d) 413; Commissioner v.
City Button Works, 49 F. (2d) 705.
Nor are we able to conclude that in the instant case the
preferred stock with voting right should be excluded because it was redeemable at any time and had a limited
interest in dividends. Compare Commissioner v. Shillito
would be afforded for the evasion of taxation by the shifting of income
through price fixing, charges for services and other means by which
income could be arbitrarily assigned to one or another unit of the
group. In other cases without a consolidated return excessive taxation might be imposed as a result of purely artificial conditions existing between corporations within a controlled group."
*With respect to this provision, the report of the Committee on
Ways and Means of the House of Representatives said: "The requirement that the stock held must be 'voting' stock merely embodies in.
the law the present rule of the Treasury Department." House Rep.
No. 179, 68th Cong., 1st sess., p. 24.

Syllabus.

Realty Co., 39 F. (2d) 830; United States v. Cleveland,
P. & E. R. Co., 42 F. (2d) 413. Despite redeemability
and the limitation of dividends, the owners of the preferred stock were not in the position of creditors, but
were stockholders with a proprietary interest in the corporate undertaking and with a corresponding relation,
through the voting right, to the direction of that undertaking. The voting right remained unimpaired until
actual redemption. The statute is not concerned with a
failure to exercise existing rights, but with what is deemed
to be a more certain and adequate test of a unitary enterprise. According to this test, petitioner failed to show
affiliation. Burnet v. Howes Brothers Hide Co., 284 U. S.
583, 584.
Judgment affirmed.

BURNET, COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, v. HUFF ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 58.

Argued December 6, 1932.-Decided February 6, 1933.

1. Under the Revenue Act of 1918, to permit deduction of loss incurred "in trade or business" or "in any transaction entered into
for profit," the loss must have been "sustained during the taxable
year,"-it must be actual and present in that year; the mere existence of a liability, afterwards liquidated, is not enough. P. 159.
2. One of two partners, in 1920, embezzled money from a trust fund
held by the firm, and paid it to the other (who was innocent) in
discharge of the firm's indebtedness to him. The other discovered
the theft that year; and in the year following, when the firm ceased
business and was settled up, he restored to the fund the full amount,
paying part with the firm's remaining assets and the rest from his
own pocket. Held:
(1) That, under the Revenue Act of 1918, the amount so repaid
was not deductible as a loss incurred by him in 1920. P. 161.
