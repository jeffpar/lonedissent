recurring instalments of the income, payable under a
revocable conveyance which had been made by a settlor
before the passage of this statute, should be exempt, when
collected, from the burden of the tax.
The judgment is
Reversed.

The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND and MR. JUSTICE BUTLER
are of opinion that the termination of the donor's power
of revocation was not a transfer by gift of any property

NEW YORK v. MACLAY

RECEIVERS,

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 374. Argued January 18, 19, 1933.-Decided February 6, 1933.
Under R. S. § 3466, debts due by an insolvent corporation to the
United States have priority over claims of a State for franchise
taxes due but not liquidated, although by the state law such taxes
are a lien in the sense*that, when liquidated, they take precedence,
by relation, over other intervening claims. Pp. 289-294.
59 F. (2d) 979, affirmed.
CERTIORARI, 287 U. S. 590, to review the affirmance of an
order granting priority to the United States in the payment of income taxes and of a claim for damages, over
the claim bf the State of New York for franchise and
gross earnings taxes, in the liquidation through a receivership of the assets of an insolvent corporation.

Bennett, Jr., Attorney General of New York, and

MR. JUsTIcE

CAmuozo delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The controversy is one between the United States and
a state as to priority of payment out of the assets of an
insolvent corporation.
Receivers of the corporation were appointed by a consent decree in January, 1927, and creditors were directed
to file their claims. The decree had the effect of a general assignment. Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492,
502. The United States filed with the receivers a claim
for additional taxes in the sum of $33,663.97 due from the
insolvent for the years 1917 and 1918, and also a claim
for $516.46 expenses incurred in the replacement of a
buoy run into by the insolvent's tug. The State of New
York filed a claim for franchise taxes due for the years
1921 to 1925, but not assessed or liquidated till after the
receivership. It filed another claim afterwards for taxes.
due for later years. The District Court held that under
§ 3466 of the Revised Statutes (31 U. S. Code, § 191), the
debt owing to the United States had a preference over the
debt owing to the state in the distribution of the fund.
Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for. the
second circuit, the decree was affirmed. 59 F. (2d) 99.
The case is here on certiorari.
The decision of this court in County of Spokane v.
United States, 279 U. S. 80, upheld the power of Congress
to give priority to debts due to the People of the United
States, though the debts thereby subordinated were due
to the People of a State, or its political subdivisions. To

that decision we adhere. The hardship to the state, if
there is any, "is the necessary consequence of the supremacy of the laws of the United States on all subjects
to which the legislative power of congress extends." Marshall, C. J., in United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 396.
Cf. Florida v. Mellon, 273 U. S. 12, 17.
The tax held to have been subordinated in the Spokane
County suit was not a perfected lien upon the property
of the insolvent at the date of the receivership. 279 U.'S.
80, 93, 94. The question was reserved whether a different
conclusion would have been necessary if such a lien had
been proved. 279 U. S. 95. Certiorari was granted in this
case because .of the claim of the petitioner that by the
statutes of New York franchise taxes become liens in advance for the years in which they are due, though the
amount is not fixed and must be liquidated thereafter.
Liens in a sense they unquestionably are, but, we think,
not so perfected or specific as to change the rule of distribution. The receivers were appointed, as we have
seen, in January, 1927; and the petitioner, if not preferred
at the time of the appointment, did not win itself a
preference by anything done thereafter. United States v.
Oklahoma, 261 U. S. 253, 260. By the statutes of New
York, "every such tax or fee [including the annual franchise tax to be paid by corporations] shall be a lien and
binding upon the real and personal property of the corporation . . . liable to pay the same until the same is
paid in full." N. Y. Tax Law, Consolidated Laws, c. 60,
§ 197. The lien thus created is effective for many purposes though its amount is undetermined. It is notice to
mortgagees or purchasers, who are held to loan or purchase at their own risk if they take their mortgages or
deeds before the tax has been assessed or paid. Carey v.
Keith, Inc., 250 N. Y. 216; 164 N. E. 912; Engelhardt v.
Alvino Realty Co., Inc., 248 N. Y. 374; 162 N. E. 287. In
that respect it is similar to the lien of a transfer tax or

duty upon the estate of a decedent. Midurbai" Realty
Co. v. F. Dee & L. Realty Corp., 247 N. Y. 307; 160 N. E.
380; Stock v. Mann, 255 N. Y. 100, 104; 174 N. E. 76. It
will even be superior, at all events after assessment (N. Y.
Terminal Co. v. Gaus, 204 N. Y. 512, 514; 98 N. E. 11)
to mortgages already made, and will thus prevail against
a purchaser who buys at a foreclosure sale. N. Y. Terminal Co. v. Gaus, supra. Cf. Marshall v. New York, 254
U. S. 380, 384. All this is settled in New York by reiterated judgments.
The problem here is different. To hold that a lien has
progressed to such a point as to be a warning to mortgagees and purchasers of a contingent liability, like a
notice of lis penden8, is far from holding that while the
liability is unliquidated and unknown the lien thus created is perfect and specific. By the terms of the hypothesis it is nothing of the kind. If the state were to stand
upon the warning and omit to ascertain the debt, it would
never be able to sell anything, for it would not know how
much to sell. Against mortgagees and purchasers a lien
perfected afterwards may take effect by relation as of the
date of the inchoate lien through which mortgagees and
purchasers became chargeable with notice. The doctrine
of relation will not divest the United States of the preference that accrued when receivers were appointed.
In what has been written there has been an assumption
in favor of the petitioner that the tax would have priority
if its amount had been liquidated before rights and interests became static through insolvency proceedings. The
assumption is hardly to be reconciled with a judgment of
this court pronounced a century and more ago. Thelusson
v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396, 426. The ruling there was that
the general lien of a judgment upon the lands of an insolvent debtor is subordinate to the preference established
by the statute unless seizure by a marshal or some other
equivalent 'act has made the lien specific and brought

about a change of title or possession. Later cases have
drawn a distinction between the liens of judgments and of
mortgages. These last have been thought to have the
effect of a conveyance, divesting the debtor of his title and
leaving nothing but an equity to which a preference can
attach. Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Co., .1 Pet. 386;
Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 Pet. 596, 611, 612; Savings Society v. Multnomah County, 169 U. S. 421, 428.
We do not now determine whether the holding in the
mortgage cases is to be applied in jurisdictions where a
mortgage upon real estate is a lien and nothing more
(Trimm v. Marsh, 54 N. Y. 599), nor whether, if so applied, it imports a modification of the holding in the
Thelusson case as to the lien of a judgment. Cf. United
States v. Canal Bank, 3 Story 79, 81; United States v.
Duncan, 4 McLean 607, 630. A mortgage, even though
a lien, is one much more specific than a judgment or a tax,
much closer to ownership. Conard v. Atlantic Insurance
Co., 8upra, p. 443; In re Boyd, 4 Sawyer 262, 264. Into
these refinements and their consequences, there is no need
to enter now. Enough for present purposes that the statutory preference must prevail against the lien of a tax not
presently enforcible, but serving merely as a caveat of a
more perfect lien to come.
The judgment is
Affirmed.
