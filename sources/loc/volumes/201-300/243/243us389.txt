Syllabus.

But, considering the doctrine now affirmed by a majority of the court as established, it follows as of course
that Congress has power to fix a maximum as well as a
minimum wage for trainmen; to require compulsory arbitration of labor disputes which may seriously and
directly jeopardize the movement of interstate traffic; and
to take measures effectively to protect the free flow of such
commerce against any combination, whether of operatives,
owners, or strangers.

APPEALS FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH.
Nos. 202-207.

Argued October 11, 12, 1916.-Decided March 19, 1917.

The power to regulate the use of the lands of the United States, and
to prescribe the conditions upon which rights in them may be acquired by others, is vested exclusively in Congress.
The inclusion of such lands within a State does not diminish this power,
or subject the lands or interests in them to disposition by the state

power; and, therefore, such lands, within a State, or ways across
them, are not subject to be occupied or used for private or quasipublic purposes, under state laws, save such laws as have been
adopted or made applicable by Congress.
The Act of May 14, 1896, c. 179, 29 Stat. 120, relating exclusively to
rights of way and the use of land for electric power purposes, covering
the subject fully and specifically and containing new provisions, was
evidently designed to be complete in itself, and therefore, by necessary implication, superseded the provisions of Rev. Stats., §§ 2339
and 2340 (derived from the Acts of 1866 and 1870), in so far as they
were applicable to such rights of way.
The legislation embodied in Rev. Stats., §§ 2339 and 2340, granted
rights of way for ditches, canals and reservoirs only, and did not
cover power-houses, transmission lines, or subsidiary structures.
Sections 18-21 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, relate
to rights for ditches, canals and reservoirs for the purpose of irrigation and call for the filing of maps, to be effective when approved
by the Secretary of the Interior; the Act of May 11, 1898, c..292,
30 Stat. 404, permits the rights so approved under the Act of 1891
to be used for certain purposes, including power development, as
subsidiary to the main purpose of irrigation; but neither act applies
where no maps have been filed or approved, where the rights claimed
include power-houses, subsidiary buildings and transmission lines,
and where irrigation is neither the sole nor the main purpose of the
use.
Whether or not the Act of February 15, 1901, c. 372, 31 Stat. 790,
superseded other earlier right of way provisions, it obviously took
the place of the Act of May 14, 1896, supra.
The Act of February 1, 1905, c. 288, 33 Stat. 628, makes no provision
for electric power-houses, transmission lines or structures subsidiary
thereto, the rights of way granted being only for ditches, canals and
reservoirs for diverting, storing and carrying water.
The purposes for which rights of way may be obtained under the Act
of February 1, 1905, supra, viz., municipal or mining purposes and
for milling and reduction of ores, do not include the generating of
electricity for general, commercial disposition even though some
part of the current is sold in adjacent or distant towns for power,
lighting and heating, or to persons engaged in mining, milling or
reducing ores.
The United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers
or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or
cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit. So held

in regard to an alleged agreement for the use of federal lands by a
power company.
As a general rule, laches or neglect of duty on the part of government
officers is no defense to a suit to enforce a public right or protect
a public interest.
If this rule has exceptions, they in turn are limited by the principle
which places on different planes an ordinary private suit over title
and a suit maintained by the United States to enforce its policy
respecting land held in trust for all the people. Causey v. United
States, 240 U. S. 399, 402.
The discretion of Congress to control the use of federal lands through
administrative regulations is not narrowly confined.
Where such regulations exceed the power of or authorization by Congress, they may be disregarded as void, but not so where they are
merely illiberal, inequitable or unwise.
Parties whose occupancy and use of federal lands can be legitimated
only by complying with the Act of February 15, 1901, supra, may
not be heard to complain of the regulations adopted in its execution
until they seek a license or permit under the act and conform, or
appropriately offer to conform, 'to all of the regulations which are
lawful.
The acts of Congress providing or recognizing that rights to the use
of water in streams running through public lands and reservations
may be acquired in accordance with local laws do not authorize
the appropriation of rights of way through lands of the United
States.
In a suit by the United States to ertjoin unlawful occupancy and use of
its reserved lands, compensation measured by the reasonable value
of the occupancy and use, considering its extent and duration,
should be included in the decree.
The compensation should not be measured by the charges prescribed
for like uses by governmental regulations when the regulations have
not been accepted-or assented to by the defendants.
THE case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. William V. Hodges and Mr. Graham Sumner, for
the Utah Power & Light Co.
Every State has the power of eminent domain as an
attribute of sovereignty. The essence of the power is
the right to take property for a public purpose. It depends
upon the jurisdiction of the sovereign over the property

and not its jurisdiction over the owner. Kohl v. United

Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., 153 U. S. 525; Adirondack Ry. Co. v. New York State, 176 U. S. 335, 346.
The rights and powers of the United States as the owner
of land within a State which is not used or needed for a
governmental purpose, are the same as those of other
owners of similar land within the same State. Section 3
of Article IV of the Federal Constitution does not create
or define the rights or powers of the United States as an
owner of land. It relates only to property owned by the
United States and confers upon Congress only such rights
and powers as are incidents of ownership. The nature and
scope of such rights and powers must be determined by
the general law of the State in which the land is located.

so intended. The United States has no power to interfere with- the governmental operations of the States.

The immunity of the United States or any other sovereign from interference extends only to property which is
used or needed for a governmental purpose. The Davis,

The mere holding of land not used or needed for a governmental purpose is not a sovereign or governmental
function of the United States. The taking of such land
by a State in the exercise of its power of eminent domain
does not interfere with the governmental functions of the
United States. The purely proprietary interests of the
United States should yield to the sovereign powers and

public needs of the States.
The authorities sustain the power of eminent domain
of the States with respect to land of the United States
which is not used or needed for a governmental purpose.

The failure of Congress to provide for actions to condemn land of the United States does not affect the sub-

stantive rights or powers of the States. The United
States by bringing this suit 'has submitted to the jurisdiction of the court. When a public service corporation

constructs its plant upon the land of another without condemnation or agreement it will not be ousted at the suit
of the owner, but will merely be compelled to pay damages
measured by the reasonable value of the land. Roberts v.

R. R. Co. v. Smith, 171 U. S. 260; Donohue v. R. R. Co.,

The land involved in this suit was vacant, unoccupied,
unappropriated land, open to entry and settlement under
the general land laws. These laws amounted to a declaration by Congress that the land was not needed for any
governmental purpose. The reservation of this land later
as a national forest did not amount to a declaration that it
was needed for a governmental purpose.
The State of Utah has the power of eminent domain
for the purpose of developing hydro-electric power and
selling the same to the public and has authorized the defendant to use the land involved in this action for that
purpose. Act of Territory of Utah, approved Feb. 20,

The use of water for beneficial purposes may be declared by the laws of the State to be a public use.
General acts of Congress intended to aid and encourage
the development of the country should be liberally construed so as to effectuate their purpose.
The Acts of 1866 and 1870, now §§ 2339 and 2340,
Rev. Stats., are to be construed as recognizing and confirming, and not as granting, rights of way over the
public land for the beneficial use of water. Such rights are
acquired by appropriation under the local laws. Jennison

The Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1095, does not repeal

by said act; and rights of way under it may be reserved
by the filing and approval of maps, or may be acquired
by definite location and construction alone. In this respect the act is like the general railroad right-of-way act
of 1875. Jamestown R. R. Co. v. Jones, 177 U. S. 125;

or any other act of Congress, are attempts at the exercise
of legislative power, and are null and void.
The power of the United States by its own laws to protect its property from private waste or trespass does not
give it a general jurisdiction over vacant lands within a
State.
Section 2339, Rev. Stats., is not inconsistent with and
has not been repealed by any subsequent congressional
legislation, including the Acts of May 14, 1896, and February 15, 1901. Repeals by implication are not favored.
The Act of 1901, considered as a substitute for other
laws and as providing the only method under which rights
of way could be obtained, acquired or 'used over the public
lands for the purposes indicated, would be unconstitutional.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Knqebel for the United
States.
By leave of court, a brief was filed by the Attorneys
General of the States of Utah, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada
and Nebraska, and Messrs. Frank H. Short, Clyde C.
Dawson and S. A. Bailey, special counsel, as amici curie:
The act of Congress admitting a State operates as a
grant of the title to federal lands submerged by navigable
waters, subject to the commercial power of the federal
government. Likewise the jurisdiction over its internal
affairs, transferredto the new State by virtue of the act of
admission, carries with it the right to establish, control
and regulate local public uses and facilities over the vacant
public lands not subjected to federal jurisdiction for the
purposes enumerated or implied in the Constitution. Even
the grant of a privilege carries with it the rights to which
the privilege is attached and without which its exercise
would be impossible.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Argument of Amici Curie.

243 U. S.

The power of the United States to protect its property
by its own legislation from private trespass and waste does
not, and cannot, imply a general police power over the
vacant.public lands within a State.
The section in the Constitution relating to the admission
of new States, and the concomitant disposition of the
public lands, excludes,, by its express terms, any construction by which the United States may claim any additional
governmental or police powers within the States in which
such 'public land is situated.
The existence of easements of a public nature over
vacant federal lands does not interfere with the disposal
of such lands by the federal government, but is in aid
thereof; and the claim made by the States of the right to
control the creation and continuance of such easements,
within their respective territorial jurisdictions, does not
conflict with the power of Congress "to dispose of and
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the
territory or other property belonging to the United
States." Idaho-Iowa Lateral & Reservoir Co. v. Fisher,
27 Idaho, 695; Homer E. Brayton, 31 L. D. 364, 365;
Crane Falls Co. v. Snake River Co., 24 Idaho, 77.
The ninth section of the Act of July 26, 1866 (Rev.
Stats., § 2339), was an express recognition of the right of
the States to regulate the appropriation and use of water
for all purposes except navigation, and of the subordination of the proprietary interest of the United States in its
vacant public lands to that right. Broder v. Water Company, 101 U. S.274, 275; Butte City Water Co. v. Baker,
196 U. S. 119; Stowell v. Johnson, 7 Utah, 215.
Subsequent acts of Congress ton the subject not only
can, but should, be construed consistently with this right
of the States so recognized by the Act of July 26, 1866. As
an act intended to encourage the development of the
country, it should be liberally construed.

by the Land Department under the Act of March 3, 1891,
supra, and not to supersede, modify or repeal the ninth
section of the Act of July 26, 1866, nor to interfere with
the operation of the local laws on the subject of the beneficial use of water.
The rights of way mentioned in the Act of February 15,
1901, supra, are all permanent in their nature; and from
the body of the act it is plain that the only one which is
subject to purchase and termination after construction is
the right of way for telephone and telegraph lines, and that
this can only be terminated by paying the valuation to be
fixed in accordance with the prior statute referred to in
the act. The administration of the Act of February 15,
1901, remains, therefore, in the hands of the Secretary
of the Interior and was not transferred to the Secretary of
Agriculture in forest reservations by the Act of February 1,
1905.
The regulations of the Departments of the Interior and
of Agriculture, assuming entire control over the appropriation and use of water on the public domain, sought to be
enforced in this and similar cases, are unauthorized by
any Act of Congress, and are unconstitutional and void.
The laws and policy of a State may be framed and shaped
to suit its conditions of climate and soil. The State has

MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of
the court.
We are concerned here with three suits by the United
States to enjoin the continued occupancy and use, without its permission, of certain of its lands in forest reservations in Utah as sites for works employed in generating
and distributing electric power, and to secure compensation for such occupancy and use in the past. The reservations were created by executive orders and proclamations
with the express sanction of Congress. Almost all the
lands therein belong to the United States and before the
reservations were created were, public lands subject to
disposal and acquisition under the general land laws. The
works in question consist of diversion dams, reservoirs,
pipe lines, power houses, transmission lines and some
subsidiary structures. In the aggregate these are used in
collecting water from mountain streams, in conducting
it for considerable distances to power houses where the
force arising from its descent through the pipe lines is
transmuted into electric energy, and in transmitting that
energy to places beyond the reservations, where it is sold

Opinion of the Court.

to whoever has occasion to use it for power, lighting or
heating. In each case some part of the works is on private
lands, but much the greater part is on lands of the United
States. Part was constructed before and part after the
reservation was created, but all after 1896 and nearly
all after 1901. The entire works are conducted in each
instance as a commercial enterprise, and not as an incident to or in aid of any other business in which the defendant is engaged.
In occupying and using the government lands as sites
for these Works the defendants have proceeded upon the
assumption that they were entitled so to do without seeking or securing any grant or license from the Secretary
of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture under the
legislation of Congress, and, in truth, they have neither
applied for nor received such a grant or license from either.
But, notwithstanding this, they assert that they have acquired and are invested with rights to occupy and use
permanently, for the purposes indicated, the government
lands upon which the works are located.
The principal object of the suits, as is said in one of the
briefs, is to test the validity of these asserted rights and,
if they be found invalid, to require the defendants to conform to the legislation of Congress or, at their option, to
remove from the government lands. The District Court
ruled against the defendants upon the main question,
following a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in
another case, 209 Fed. Rep. 554, but refused the Government's prayer for pecuniary relief. Cross appeals were
then taken directly to this court.
The first position taken by the defendants is that their
claims must be tested by the laws of the State in which
the lands are situate rather than by the legislation of
Congress, and in support of this position they say that
lands of the United States within a State, when not used
or needed for a fort or other governmental purpose of the

243 U. S.

United States, are subject to the jurisdiction, powers and
laws of the State in the same way and to the same extent
as are similar lands of others. To this we cannot assent.
Not only does the Constitution (Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2) commit to Congress the power "to dispose of and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting" the lands of the
United States, but the settled course of legislation, congressional and state, and repeated decisions of this court
have gone upon the theory that the power of- Congress is
exclusive and that only through its exercise in some form
can rights in landF belonging to the United States be
acquired. True, for many purposes a State has civil and
criminal jurisdiction over lands within its limits belonging to the United States, but this jurisdiction does not
extend to any matter that is not consistent with full
power in the United States to protect its lands, to control
their use and to prescribe in what manner others may
acquire rights in them. Thus while the State may punish
public offenses, such as murder or larceny, committed on
such lands, and may tax private property, such as live
stock, located thereon, it may not tax the lands themselves
or invest others with any right whatever in them. United
States v. McBratney, 104 U. S. 621, 624; Van Brocklin v.
Tennessee, 117 U. S. 151, 168; Wisconsin Central R. R. Co.
v. Price Co., 133 U. S. 496, 504. From the earliest times
Congress by its legislation, applicable alike in the States
and Territories, has regulated in many particulars the
use by others of the lands of the United States, has prohibited and made punishable various acts calculated to
be injurious to them or to prevent their use in the way intended, and has provided for and controlled the acquisition of rights of way over them for highways, railroads,
canals, ditches, telegraph lines and the like. The States
and the public have almost uniformly accepted this legislation as controlling, and in the instances where it has been
questioned in this court its validity has been upheld and

Opinion of the Court.

its supremacy over state enactments sustained. Wilcox
v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 516; Jourdan v. Barrett,,4 How.
168, 185; Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92, 99; Canfield
v. United States, 167 U. S. 518; Light v. United States,
220 U. S. 523, 536-537. ,And so we are of opinion that
the inclusion within a State of lands of the United States
does not take from Congress the power to control their
occupancy and use, to protect them from trespass and
injury and to prescribe the conditions upon which others
may obtain rights in them, even though this may involve the exercise in some measure of what commonly
is known as the police power. "A different rule," as was
said in Camfield v. United States, supra, "would place the
public domain of the United States completely at the
mercy of state legislation.".
It results that state laws, including tho3e relating to the
exercise of the power of eminent domain, have no bearing
upon a controversy such as is here presented, save as they
may have been adopted or made applicable by Congress.
The next position taken by the defendants is that their
claims are amply sustained by §§ 2339 and 2340 of the
Revised Statutes, originally enacted in 1866 and 1870.
By them the right of way over the public lands was
granted for ditches, canals and reservoirs used in diverting,
storing and carrying water for "mining, agricultural,
manufacturing and other purposes." The extent of the
right of way in point of width or area was not stated and
the grant was noticeably free from conditions. No application to an administrative officer was contemplated, no
consent or approval by such an officer was required, and
no direction was given for noting the right of way upon
any record. Obviously this legislation was primitive.
At that time works for generating and distributing electric
power were unknown, and so were not in the mind of
Congress. Afterwards when they came into use it was
found that this legislation was at best poorly adapted

to their needs. It was limited to ditches, canals and reservoirs, and did not cover power houses, transmission lines
or the necessary subsidiary structures. In that situation
Congress passed the Act of May 14, 1896, c. 179, 29 Stat.
120, which related exclusively to rights of way for electric
power purposes, and read as follows:
"That the Secretary of the Interior be, and hereby is,
authorized and empowered, under general regulations
to be fixed by him, to permit the use of right of way to
the extent of twenty-five feet, together with the use of
necessary ground, not .exceeding forty acres, upon the
public lands and forest reservations of the United 'States,
by any citizen or association of citizens of the United
States, for the purposes of generating, manufacturing,
or distributing electric power."
We regard it as plain that this act superseded §§ 2339
and 2340 in so far as they were applicable to such rights
of way. It dealt specifically with that subject, covered
it fully, embodied some new provisions and evidently was
designed to be complete in itself. That it contained no
express, mention of ditches, canals and reservoirs is of no
significance, for it was similarly silent respecting power
houses, transmission lines and subsidiary structures.
What was done was to provide for all in a general way
without naming any of them.
As the works in question were constructed after §.§ 2339
and 2340 were thus superseded, the defendants' clair receive no support from those sections. No attempt was
made to conform to the Act of 1896, and nothing is claimed
under it.
Some reliance is placed upon §§ 18-21 of the Act of
March 3,1891, e. 561, 26 Stat. 1095, and the Act of May 11,
1898, c. 292, 30 Stat. 404. The first relate to rights of
way for ditches, canals and reservoirs for the purpose of
irrigation, and, differing from §§ 2339 and 2340, call for
the filing of maps of location which are to be effective

UTAH POWER & LIGHT CO. v. UNITED STATES. 407
243 U. S.

Olinion of the Court.

and noted upon the public records when approx 3d by the
Secretary of the Interior. The second permits rights of
way "approved" under the first to be used for certain
additional purposes, including the development of power,
"as subsidiary to the ma' purpose of irrigation." But
here no -maps of location have been filed or approved,
the rights of way are. not claimed merely for ditches,
canals or reservoirs, and irrigation is neither the sole nor
the main purpose for which any part of the asserted rights
of way is used. So it is apparent that the reliance upon
these acts is ill founded.
In the oral and written arguments counsel have given
much attention to the Act of February 15, 1901, c. 372,
31 Stat. 790. On the part of the Government it is insisted
that the comprehensive terms of the act and its legislative
history 1 conclusively show that it was adopted as a complete revision of the confused and fragmentary rightof-way provisions found in several earlier enactments,
including those already noticed, but this need not be
considered or decided now beyond observing that the act
obviously superseded and took the place of the law of
May 14, 1896, supra. The act empowers the Secretary
-of the Interior, "under general regulations to be fixed
by him," to permit the use of rights of way through the
public lands, forest reservations, 2 etc., for any one or more
of several purposes, including the generation and distribution of electric power, carefully defines the extent
of such rights of way and'embodies provisions not found
in any of the earlier enactments. But the defendants can
claim nothing under the set. They have not conformed

to its requirements and have not received any permission
or license under it.
Another statute upon which the defendants rely is the
Act of February 1, 1905, c. 288, 33 Stat. 628. But we
think it does not help them. While providing for rights
of way in forest reserves for ditches, canals, reservoirs and
the like "for municipal or mining purposes, and for the
purposes of the milling and reduction of ores," it makes no
provision for power houses, transmission lines or subsidiary structures such as the defendants have. And, in our
opinion, the purposes named do not include those for
which the works in question are used. It is not enough
that some of the electric energy is sold in adjacent or distant towns or to .those who are engaged in mining or in
milling or reducing ores. In an opinion rendered June 4,
1914, the Attorney General said of this act: "The rights
granted are described with particularity. The right of way
for transmitting and distributing electrical power is not
included expressly, nor is it so intimately related to any of
the rights-enumerated that a grant of the one must needs
be implied as esserntial to the enjoyment of the other."
30 Ops. A. G. 263. We regard this as the correct view.
In their answers some of the defendants assert that when.
the forest reservations were created an understanding
and agreement was had between the defendants, or their
predecessors, and some unmentioned officers or agents
of the United States- to the effect that the reservations
would not be an obstacle to the construction or operation
of the works in question; that all rights essential thereto
would be allowed and granted under the Act of 1905; that
consistently with this understanding and agreement and
relying thereon the defendants, or their predecessors, completed the works and proceeded with the generation and
distribution of electric energy, and that in consequence
the United States is estopped to question the right of the
defendants to maintain and operate the works. Of this

UTAH POWER & LIGHT CO. v. UNITED STATES. 400
243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court.

it is enough to say-that the United States is neither bound
nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering
into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to be
done what the law does not sanction or permit. Lee v.
Munroe, 7 Cranch, 366; Filor v. United States, 9 Wall.
45, 49; Hart v. United. States, 95 U. S. 316; Pine River
Logging Co. v. United States, 186 U. S. 279, 291.
As presenting another ground of estoppel it is said that
the agents in the forestry service and other officers' and
employees of the Government, with knowledge of what
the defendants were doing, not only did not object thereto
but impliedly acquiesced therein until after the works
were completed and put in operation. This ground also
must fail. As a general rule laches or neglect of duty on
the part of officers of the Government is no defense to a
suit by it to enforce a public right or protect a public
interest. United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, 735;
Steele v. United States, 113 U. S. 128, 134; United States
v. Beebe, 127 U. S. 338, 344; United States v. Insley, 130
U. S. 263, 265-266; United States v. Dalles Military Road
Co., 140 U. S. 599, 632; United States v. Michigan, 190
U. S. 379, 405; State ex rel. Lott v. Brewer, 64 Alabama,

Lunsford, 20 N. Car. 407; Humphrey v. Queen, 2 Can.
Exch. 38,' 390; Queen v. Black, 6 Can. Exch. 236, 253.
And, if it be assumed that the rule is subject to exceptions,
we find nothing in the cases in hand which fairly can be
said to take them out of it as heretofore understood and
applied in this court. A suit by the United States to enforce and maintain its policy respecting lands which it
holds in trust for all the people stands upon a different
plane in this and some other respects from the ordinary
private suit to regain the title to real property or to remove a cloud from it. Causey v. United States, 240 U. S.
399, 402.
By their answers the defendants assert that pome of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Opinion of the Court.

243 U. S.

administrative regulations promulgated under the Act
of February 15, 1901, go beyond what is appropriate for
the protection of. the interest of the United States and are
unconstitutional, unauthorized and unreasonable. The
regulations occupy many printed pages and the answers
do not adequately show which regulations are assailed
or the grounds upon which the invalidity of particular
ones is asserted. That Congress intends there shall be
some administrative regulations on the subject is plainly
shown in the act, and that its discretion in the matter is
not narrowly confined is shown by our decisions in United
States v. Grimaud, 220 U. S. 506, and Light v. United
States, ibid, 523. If any of the regulations go beyond
what Congress can authorize or beyond what it has authorized, those regulations are void and may be disregarded; but not so of such as are thought merely to be
illiberal, inequitable or not conducive to the best results.
In the nature of things it hardly can be that all are invalid, and this was conceded in argument. The defendants have not complied with any, or really offered to do
so, but have proceeded upon the theory that the act and
all the regulations are without application to their situation. In this they have been mistaken, and so are occupying and using. reserved lands of the United States without
its permission land contrary to its laws. Not until they
seek a license !or permit under the act and conform, or
appropriately offer to conform, to all lawful regulations
thereunder will they be in a position to complain that some
of the regulations are invalid. As we interpret the decrees
below, they enjoin the defendants from occupying and
using the lands of the United States until, and only until,
they acquire rights to do so by complying with some applicable statute and the lawful regulations. Of course,
we do not imply that any of the regulations axe invalid
but leave that question entirely open.
Much is said in the briefs about several congressional

UTAH POWER & LIGHT CO. v. UNITED STATES.

Opinion of the Court.

enactments providing or recognizing that rights to the use
of water in streams running through the public lands and
forest reservations may be acquired in accordance with
local laws, but, these enactments do not require particular
mention, for this is not a controversy over water-rights
but over rights of way through lands of the United States,
which is a different matter and is so treated in the rightof-way acts before mentioned. See Snyder v. Colorado
Gold Dredging Co., 181 Fed. Rep. 62, 69.
As the defendants have been occupying and using reserved lands of the United States without its permission
and contrary to its laws, we think it is entitled to have
appropriate compensation therefor included in the decree.
The compensation should be measured by the reasonable
value of the occupancy and use, considering its extent and
duration, and not by the scale of charges named in the
regulations as prayed in the bill. However much this
scale of charges may bind one whose occupancy and use
are under a license or permit granted under the statute,
it cannot be taken as controlling what may be recovered
from an occupant and user who has-not accepted or assented to the regulations in any way.
It follows that the decrees are right and must be affirmed,
save as they deny the Government's right to compensation for the occupancy and use in the past, and in that
respect they must be reversed.
It is so ordered.
