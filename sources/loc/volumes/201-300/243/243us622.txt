OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Order.

243 U. S.

STATE OF WYOMING v. STATE OF COLORADO
ET AL.
IN EQUITY.
No. 7, Original. Argued December 6, 7, 8, 1916.--Order entered.
March 6, 1917.

It is ordered that this case be restored to the docket for
re-argument.
1. Counsel are requested to specially direct their attention to the rule which they deem should properly be
applied to a solution of the controversy for decision: That
is, whether the rights asserted are to be tested and determined solely by the application of the general principles
of prior appropriation without regard to state boundaries,
or whether on the contrary the general principles of prior
appropriation are subject to be restricted or their operation limited in this case by state lines, and if so, by what
principles, under that assumption, the case is to be controlled.
2. They are moreover requested not merely by generalizations to state the facts relied upon, but specifically by
careful reference to the pages of the record, and to group
them under the various propositions relied upon including
the extent of the use of water in both States when the
work complained of was begun and when this suit was
commenced, and the extent of appropriation made or authorized in either or both States since its commencement.
3. In view of the legislation of Congress concerning reclamation and the extensive public works which have been
constructed under that legislation and the possible consequences which may result from the rule to be applied
in the solution of this controversy, the clerk is instructed
to notify the Attorney General of the United States of
this order for re-argument.
