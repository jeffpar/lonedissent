OCTOBER TERM, 1916,
Syllabus.

243 U. S.

The defenses were denials of the allegations of the complaint and an averment that the delay in delivery was
caused by a strike on the road, for which cause, under
the bills of lading issued by the initial carrier pursuant
to the Interstate Commerce Act, defendant was exempt
from liability for damages. This was one of the defenses
in No. 577; with which this case was submitted.
Judgment was entered for plaintiff by consent and that
plaintiff's damages be assessed at $1,841.13, "reserving
to defendant the right to reduce said judgment in accordance with its exceptions and objections pertaining to the
measure of damages and without prejudice to defendant
to appeal from said judgment pursuant to law."
The judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and
Appeals. 88 N. J. L. 235. Indeed, it was upon the opinion
in the latter case that the Court of Errors and Appeals
decided No. 577.
On the authority of No. 577 the motion to dismiss
which is made is overruled and the judgment is
Affirmed.
