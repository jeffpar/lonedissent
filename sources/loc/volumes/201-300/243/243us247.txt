Opinion of the Court.

HORN v. MITCHELL, UNITED. STATES MARSHAL
FOR THE DISTRICT. OF MASSACHUSETTS.
APPEAL -FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIRST CIRCUIT.
No. 679.

Argued January 11, 12, 1917.-Decided March 6, 1917.

A judgment of the.District Court refusing the writ of habeas corpus
is appealable directly to this court under § 238 of the Judicial Code
if the petition raises constitutional or treaty questions.
A judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgm ent of
the District Court refusing habeas corpus is not appealable to this
court under § 241 of the Judicial Code on the ground that constitutional and treaty questions are involved, since no pecuniary value
is in*controversy.
The provision made by Rev. Stats., § 764, as amended by the Act
of March 3, 1885, c. 353, 23 Stat. 437, for review in this court of the
appellate judgments of the Circuit Courts in habeas corpus cases,
was necessarily repealed by the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891 (see
§§ 4, 5, 6 and 14), and § 289 of the Judicial Code abolishing the
Circuit Courts.
Appeal to review 232 Fed. Rep. 819, dismissed.
THE

case is stated in the opinion.

Mr. Joseph F. O'Connell and Mr. Daniel T. O'Connell,
with whom Mr. James E. O'Connell was on the briefs, for
appellant.
Mr. Assistant Attorney General Warren for appellee.

indictment found in that district for a violation of the
Act of May 30, 1908, c. 234, 35 Stat. 554, now §§ 232-235
of the Criminal Code, c. 321, 35 Stat. 1088, 1134, in unlawfully transporting explosives from New York through
Massachusetts to Vanceboro, Maine, 'petitioned the
District Court for a writ of habeas corpus upon the ground
that the order of commitment was in violation of his
rights under the Constitution and laws of the United
States and existing treaties between the United States
and the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia,
for that (among other reasons) appellant is an officer of
the army of the German Empire;'that a state of war,
recognized by the President of the United States in an
official proclamation, exists between Great Britain and
Germany; that appellant is accused of destroying a part
of the international bridge in the Township of McAdam,
Province of New Brunswick, and Dominion of Canada;
that the charge of carrying explosives illegally upon which
he is held in custody is, if true, inseparably connected
with the destruction of that bridge; and that "he is a
subject and citizen bf the Empire of Germany and domiciled therein and is being held in custody for the aforesaid
act which was done under his right, title, authority, privilege, protection and exemption claimed under his commission as said officer."
After a hearing, the District Court refused the writ of
habeas corpus and dismissed the petition, 223 Fed. Rep.
549, and an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit resulted in an affirmance of the judgment, 232 Fed. Rep. 819. An appeal from the judgment
of affirmance to this court was then allowed.
There is a motion to dismiss the appeal, and this must
be granted. Assuming, as we do, that the petition for
habeas corpus raised questions involving the application
of the Constitution of the United States or the construction of a treaty made under its authority, appellant might

243 U. S.

Opinion of the Court,

have taken a direct appeal from the District Court to
this court under § 238, Jud. Code, Act of March 3, 1911,
c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087, 1157. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S.
309; Kelly v. Griffin, 241 U. S. 6; Bingham v. Bradley, 241
U. S. 511. Having appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, he cannot bring his case here except under some
provision of law allowing an appeal from that court to
this. Appeals of this character are regulated by § 241,
Jud. Code, 36 Stat. 1157, and are confined to cases
"where the matter in controversy shall exceed one thousand dollars, besides costs." It long has been settled
that the jurisdiction conferred by Congress upon any
court of the United States in a case where the matter
in controversy exceeds a certain sum of money, does
not include cases where the rights of the parties are incapable of being valued in money, and therefore excludes
habeas corpus cases. Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487, 498;
Lau Ow Bew v. United States, 144 U. S. 47, 58; Cross v.
Burke, 146 U. S. 82, 88; Whitney v. Dick, 202 U. S. 132,
135; Healy v. Backus, 241 U. S. 655.
Appellant seeks to sustain his appeal under §§ 763
and 764 of the Revised Statutes.1 They gave a right of
763. From the final decision of any court, justice, or judge
inferior to the circuit court, upon an application for a writ of habeas
corpus or upon such writ when issued, an appeal may be taken to the
circuit court for the district in which the cruse is heard:
1. In the case of any person alleged to be restrained of his liberty
in violation of the Constitution, or of any law or treaty of the United
States.
2. In the case of any prisoner who, being a subject or citizen of a
foreign state, and domiciled therein, is committed or confined, or in
custody by or under the authority or law of the United States, or of any
State, or process founded thereon, for or on account of any act done
or omitted under any alleged right, title, authority, privilege, protection, or exemption, set up or claimed under the commission, order, or
sanction of any foreign state or sovereignty, the validity and effect
whereof depend upon the law of nations, or under color thereof.
1Sec.

OCTOBER TERM, 1916.
Opinion of the Court.

243 U. S.

appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court in
two classes of habeas corpus cases, and an appeal from the
Circuit Court to this court in-cases of a class that includes
the present case. Section 764 was amended by Act of
March 3, 1885, c. 353, 23 Stat. 437, by extending the
right of appeal from the Circuit Courts to this court so
as to include the remaining cases described in the preceding section. But by § 4 of the Act of March 3, 1891, establishing Circuit Courts of Appeals (c. 517, 26 Stat.
.827), all appellate jurisdiction was taken from the Circuit
Courts, and by §§ 5 and 6 it was distributed between this
court and the Circuit Courts of Appeals. By § 14, all acts
and parts of acts relating to appeals or writs of error,
inconsistent with the provisions for review in §§ 5 and 6,
were repealed. Section 5 preserved a direct appeal from
the District Court to this court in cases involving the
construction or application of the Constitution of the
United. States, or the validity or construction of any treaty
made under its authority. In Cross v. Burke, 146 U. S.
82, 88, it was pointed out that the effect of this was that
appeals from the d~crees of the Circuit Court on Aabeas
corpus could no longer be taken to this court except in
cases of the class mentioned in the fifth section of that act.
And it was so held in In re Lennon, 150 U. S. 393, 399.
Even were it otherwise, an alJpeal from the Circuit
Court to this court was not the same as an appeal from the
Circuit Court of Appeals to this court. And the abolishment of the Circuit Courts by § 289, Jud. Code, removed
the last vestige of authority for an appeal to this court
under § 764, Rev. Stats.
Appeal dismissed.
See. 764. From the final decision of such circuit court an appeal may
be taken to the Supreme Court in the cases described in the last clause
of the preceding section.
