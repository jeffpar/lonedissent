was denying the validity of the judgment against him.
But the obligations of the judgment are reciprocal and
the fact that here the defendant is asserting and the plaintiff denying its personal effect does not alter the 6ase.

The personal judgment was not merely voidable, as was
assumed in the slightly different case of Henderson v.

PENNSYLVANIA FIRE INSURANCE COMPANY
OF PHILADELPHIA v. GOLD ISSUE MINING
AND MILLING COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.
No. 584.

Argued January 29, 1917.-Decided March 6, 1917.

A fire insurance company, to obtain a license to do business in Missouri, filed with the Superintendent of the Insurance Department
of that State, under Missouri Rev. Stats., 1909, ยง 7042, a power of
attorney consenting that service of process on him should be deemed
personal service on the company so long as it should have any liabilities outstanding in the State. The Missouri Supreme Court,
construing the statute, held that the consent covered service in an
action in Missouri on a policy issued in Colorado insuring buildingr
in the latter State. Held, that the construction had a rational basis
in the statute and therefore could not be deemed to deprive the
company of due process of law, even if it took it by surprise. O'Neil
v. Northern ColoradoIrrigationCo., 242 U. S. 20, 26.

tinguished.
A mere error of construction committed by a state court in a candid
effort to construe the laws of another State is not a denial of full
faith and credit (Const., Art. IV, ยง 1), entitling the complaining
party to come to this court.
267 Missouri, 524, affirmed.

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Fred.Herrington, with whom Mr. Mason A. Lewis,
Mr. James B. Grant and Mr. David H. Robertson were
on the brief, for plaintiff in error.
Mr. Patrick Henry Cullen, with whom Mr. Thomas T.
Fauntleroy and Mr. Charles M. Hay were on the brief, for
defendant in error.
MR. JUSTICE HOILES delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a suit upon a policy of insurance issued in Colorado by the defendant, the plaintiff in error, to the defendant in error, an Arizona corporation, insuring buildings in Colorado. The defendant insurance company
had obtained a license to do business in Missouri and to
that end, in compliance with what is now Rev. Stats. Mo.,
1909, ยง 7042, had filed with the Superintendent of the
Insurance Department a power of attorney consenting
that service of process upon the superintendent should
be deemed personal service upon the company so long as
it should have any liabilities outstanding in the State.
The present suit was begun by service upon the superintendent. The insurdnce company set up that such service
was insufficient except in suits upon Missouri contracts
and that if the statute were construed to govern the

Opinion of the Court.

present case it encountered the Fourteenth Amendment
by denying to the defendant due 'process of law. The
Supreme Court of Missouri held that the statute applied
and was consistent with the Constitution of the United
States. 267 Missouri, 524.
The construction of the Missouri statute thus adopted
hardly leaves a constitutional question open. The defendant had executed a power of attorney that made
service on the superintendent the equivalent of personal
service. If by a corporate vote it had accepted service in
this specific case there would be no doubt of the jurisdiction of the state court over a transitory action of contract.
If it had appointed an agent authorized in terms to receive
service in such cases, there would be equally little doubt.
New York, Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. Estill, 147
U. S. 591. It did appoint an agent in language that rationally might be held to go to that length. The language
has been held to go to that length, and the construction
did not deprive the defendant of due process of law even
if it took the defendant by surprise, which we have no
warrant to assert. O'Neil v. Northern ColoradoIrrigation
Co., 242 U. S. 20, 26. Other state laws have been construed in a similar way; e. g., Bagdon v. Philadelphia&
Reading Coal & Iron Co., 217 N. Y. 432. Johnston v.
Trade Insurance Co., 132 Massachusetts, 432.
The defendant relies upon Old Wayne Mutual Life
Association v. McDonough, 204 U. S. 8, and Simon v.
Southern Railway Co., 236 U. S. 115. But the distinction
between those cases and the one before us is shown at
length in the judgment of the court below, quoting a
brief .and pointed statement in Smolik v. Philadelphia &
Reading Coal & Iron Co., 222 Fed. Rep. 148; a statement
reinforced by Cardozo, J., in Bagdon v. Philadelphia &
Reading Coal & Iron Co., 217 N. Y. 432. In the above
mentioned suits the corporations had been doing business
in certain States without authority. They had not ap-

pointed the agent as required by statute, and it was held
that service upon the agent whom they should have appointed was ineffective in suits upon causes of action
arising in other States. The case of service upon an agent
voluntarily appointed was left untouched. 236 U. S. 129,
130. If the business out of which the action arose had
been local it was admitted that the service would have
been good, and it was said that the corporation would be
presumed to have assented. Of course, as stated by
Learned Hand, J., in 222 Fed. Rep. 148, 151, this consent
is a mere fiction, justified by holding the corporation estopped to set up its own wrong as a defence. Presumably
the fiction was adopted to reconcile 'the intimation with
the general rules concerning jurisdiction. Lafayette Insurance Co. v. French, 18 How. 404. Michigan Trust Co.
v. Ferry, 228 U. S. 346, 353. But when a power actually
is conferred by a document, the party executing it takes
the risk of the interpretation that may be put upon it by
the courts. The execution was the defendant's voluntary
act. The Eliza Lines, 199 U. S. 119, 130, 131.
The insurance company also sets up that the Supreme
Court of Missouri failed to give full faith and credit to the
public acts of Colorado. The ground is that one condition of the policy was that the insured was the owner in
fee simple of the land under the insured buildings; that
when the plaintiff bought the land, as it did, it had not
taken out a license to. do business in Colorado, and that
the laws of that State forbade the plaintiff to acquire any
real or personal property until the license fees should have
been paid. The Missouri court held that it was enough
if the plaintiff had paid the fees and got the license before
instituting this suit. There is nothing to suggest that it
was not candidly construing the Colorado statutes to the
best of its ability, and even if it was wrong something
more than an error of construction is necessary in order
to entitle a party to come here under Article IV, ยง 1.

The plaintiff suggests that the whole controversy is res

Missouri, 193, in which the insurance company is said

to have been one of the relators, and which followed the
decision in State v. Grimm, 239 Missouri, 135.

It also

urges that the defendant waived any objection it might
have had to the validity of this service by appearing and
pleading to the merits. As the facts hardly appear and
as the state court discussed the merits of the case we do
not pass upon these matters which in a different state of
the record might need at least a few words.
Judgment affirmed.
