UNITED STATES.
ERROR TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THIE FIFTH
CIRCUIT.

No. 300.

Argued February 28, March 1, 1923.-.Decided April 9,
1923.

1. Authority from Congress to condemn a particular canal for use as
part of a specified waterway, includes by implication so much land
on either side as is essential to that purpose. P. 584.
2. The Secretary of War, having been authorized to purchase the
Hanson Canal for use as part of the intracoastal waterway project
(Act of July 25, 1912, c. 253, 37 Stat. 212), could acquire it by condemnation, under the general authority given government officers
by the Act of August 1, 1888, c. 728, 25 Stat. 357, so to proceed
when authorized to procure real estate for the erection of a public
building or for other public uses. P. 585.
3. The Act of April 24,1888, c. 194, 25 Stat. 94, authorizing the Secretary of War to acquire by condemnation land, etc., needed to
enable him to maintain, operate or prosecute works for the improvement of rivers and harbors, does not operate to exclude the field
to which it relates from the purview of the Act of August 1, 1888,
supra. Id.
4. The fact that an act authorizing purchase of specific property
limits the price to be paid, does not preclude resort to condemnation under, a general statutory authority to proceed in that way,
subject to the owner's constitutional right to have just compensation
judicially ascertained and paid before his title passes and to retain
his right to possession until reasonable, certain and adequate provision has been made for obtaining just compensation. P. 586.
5. In a proceeding by the United States to condemn a canal with land
on each side--Held:
(a) That resolutions of the board of directors of the corporate
owner, reciting the necessity for the taking and an agreement with

the United States for a sale at a specified price and authorizing
a conveyance, with certain reservations, upon payment of that
sum, were not privileged, as an attempt to compromise, but admissions, admissible as evidence of the Government's right to
take, decided by the court, and of the value of the property, decided by the jury. P. 588.
(b) That instructions that the jury should consider the original cost
of the canal, the cost of reproducing it, and the reasons of the
owner for contracting to sell it at a certain price, but might find
a greater or less amount,-were unobjectionable. P. 589.
(c) That evidence of the original cost, of a much larger reproduction cost, and of the size, suitability for use, and condition of the
canal, sustained a verdict for the amount of the original cost.

The United States instituted condemnation proceedings
in the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana
to acquire the so-called Hanson Canal and a strip of land
three hundred feet wide including the canal. Plaintiff in
error was the owner and objected to the taking on grounds
hereinafter stated. Judgment was given condemning the
property and vesting title in the United States when the
amount found in favor of the owner shall have been paid.

is. here
The owner contends that the District Court
and Circuit
Court of Appeals erred in holding that the acts of Congress relied upon by the Government confer authority to
condemn the canal proper and the land adjacent to and
outside the limits thereof within a strip of a total width
of three hundred feet inclusive of the -canal.
The property is sought to be taken to constitute a part
of the intracoastal canal projected by the Government
extending from Boston to the Rio Grande. A number of
acts of Congress' must be considered. Prior to the Act
-'Act approved March 2, 1907, c. 2509, 34 Stat. 1089, makes appropriation for: "Improving Inland Witerway Channel from Franklin
to Mermentau, Louisiana,

..

"

Act approved March 3, 1909, c. 264, 35 Stat. 815, 81i, provides:
"That appropriations or authbizations for appropriations heretofore
made may . . . be diverted or applied upon modified projects
for the rivers and harbors hereinafter named, as follows: . .
"Inland waterway between Franklin and Mermentau, Louisiana:
To secure a suitable right of way for the proposed inland waterway
channel from Franklin to Mermentau, adopted by Congress in the
river and harbor Act of March second, nineteen hundred and seven,
the location of the eastern terminus of said channel may be changed
from the town of Franklin, on Bayou Teche, to *such other point on
'said bayou as the Secretary of War may select: Provided, That the
modification herein authorized shall not be made unless a valid title
to the necessary right of way be secured to the United States frea
of cost."
Act approved February 27, 1911, c. "166,,36 Stat. 942, 943, makes
appropriation lor: "Inland waterway between Franklin and Mermentau, Louisiana: To insure the selection of the most .uitable route
for the inland waterway channel from Franklin to Mermentau
adopted by Congress in the river and harbor act of March second,
nineteen hundred and seven, the Secretary of War is hereby authorized, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers, to make such
changes in the location of said channel as may be considered desirable: Provided, That no change shall be made under this authorization unless the necessary right of way is secured to the United States
free of cost."

approved July 25, 1912, it was contemplated that the
right of way necessary for the enterprise would be secured
to the United States free of cost. That act authorized
the Secretary of War to purchase the Hanson Canal for
use as a part of the waterway from Franklin to Mermentau, Louisiana, included in the intracoastal project,
at a cost not to exceed $65,000. September 29, 1913, the
board of directors of the owning company adopted resolutions which referred to the pertinent provisions of the
Acts of Congress respectively approved March 2, 1907,
and July 25, 1912, and recited that "it is necessary for
the United States to have and own a right of way three
hundred feet in width in order to improve and enlarge
said canal and make the same a part of the said Inland
Waterway;" that the United States has proposed and
agreed to purchase the canal, including a three hundred
feet wide strip of right of way and certain locks and other
constructions thereon, and authorized and empowered the
vice president who was the chief executive officer of the
corporation, upon the payment of $65,000 as compensation, to convey the property to the United States.
These resolutions and the other circumstances disclosed
by the record make it sufficiently clear that the land on
either side of the canha is essential to the enterprise. It
Act. approved July 25, 1912, c. 253, 37 Stat. 201-212.
Act approved April 24, 1888, c. 194, 25 Stat. 94-an act to facilitate the prosecution of works projected for the improvement of rivers
and harbors-provides: "That the Secretary of War may cause proceedings to be instituted, in the name of the United States, in any
court having jurisdiction of such proceedings, for the acquirement by
condemnation of any land, right of way, or material needed to enable
him to maintain, operate or prosecute works for the improvement of
rivers and harbors for which provision has been made by law; such
proceedings to be prosecuted in accordance with the laws relating to
suits for the condemnation of properiy of the States wherein the
proceedings may be instituted: . .
Act approved August 1, 1888, c. 728, 25 Stat. 357.

HANSON CO. v. UNITED STATES.
581

Opinion of the Court.

follows that if the condemnation of the canal, proper is
authorized, the land may also be taken.
For authority to condemn, the United States relies.on
the Acts of July 25, 1912, and August 1, 1888. The pertinent provisions are:
" Improving waterway from Franklin to Mermentau,.
Louisiana: The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to
purchase, for use as a part of said waterway, the so-called
Hanson Canal . . . at a cost not to exceed $65,000,
.
."
(c. 253, 37 Stat. 212.)
"That in every case in which the Secretary of the
Treasury or any other officer of the Government has been
or hereafter shall be, authorized to pro6ure real estate for
the erection of a public building or for other public uses
he shall be, and hereby is, authorized to acquire the same
for the United States by condemnation, under judicial
process, whenever in his opinion it is necessary or advantageous to the Government -to do so,
.
." and
jurisdiction is conferred upon the District Courts of priceedings for such condemnation, and the practice, pleadings, forms and proceedings are made to conform as near
as may be to those existing in like cases in the courts of
the State within which such District Courts are held
(c. 728, 25 Stat. 357.)
Plaintiff in error argues that the Act.of April 24, 1888,
cited in the margin, conferring power upon the Secretary
of War to condemn land, right of way and material needed
to enable him to carry on work ih connection with improvement of rivers and harbors, is exclusive and evidences an intention that the Act of August 1, 1888, shall
not .apply in that field, and that the Acts of 1907, 1909,
1911, and. 1912, engraft an exception on the Act. of April
24, 1888, to the effect that, as to the Hanson Canal property here sought to be taken, no power to condemn exast3,
and that it must be acquired, if at all, by contract of purchase at a price not in excess of the sum specified. It is

true that the authority granted by the Act of August 1,
1888, to some extent overlaps that granted by the earlier
statute, (April 24, 1888) but there is no conflict between
them. The earlier does not operate to limit the *effect of
the later act. The Act of 1912 specifically authorizes the
purchase of the property because deemed necessary for
public use. It would have been futile to authorize the
purchase of an essential part of a great project, withholding power to condemn, and so leave it within the power
of the owner to defeat the program by demanding a price
in excess of $65,000 or by refusing to sell at all. The argument is without force.
Another contention of plaintiff.in error is that the provision of the Act of July 25, 1912, limiting the authorized
purchase price to $65,000, negatives and necessarily excludes authority to condemn. This is not a case where
attempt is made by legislation to fix or limit the just compensation to be paid for private property condemned. It
is not like MonongahelaNavigation Co. v. United States,
148 U. S. 312, where Congress sought to exclude the value
of the owner's franchise right to exact tolls for service performed, thereby violating the Fifth Amendment. The
provision authorizing the Secretary to purchase at a cost
not to exceed a specified amount has nothing to do with
the judicial ascertainment of just compensation for the
property condemned. Shoemaker v. United States, 147
U. S. 282, 302. Neither the right of the owner to be put
in as good position pecuniarily as he would have been if
his property had not been taken,2 nor the right to have
ascertainment a:nd payment of just compensation as a
condition of the taking,8 is attempted to be impaired by
'Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co. v. United Stat s, ante, 299, and cases
there cited.

legislation here under consideration. It is not necessary
that the exact amount required shall be appropriated or
that legislation shall indicate no limit upon the expenditure for property to be taken. There is no declaration or
evidence of legislative purpose to violate the just compensation clause or to secure the property in question for less
than the full amount to which the owner was entitled4
The power of eminent domain is not dependent upon any
specific grant; it is an attribute of sovereignty, limited
and conditioned by the just compensation clause of the
Fifth Amendment. The owner is protected by the rule
that title does not pass until compensation has been ascertained and paid, nor a right to the possession until reasonable, certain and adequate provision is made for obtaining just compensation. Cherokee Nation v. Southern
Kansas Ry. Co., 135 U. S. 641, 659; Bauman v. Ross, 167
U. S. 548, 598, 599; Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot
Co., 169 U. S. 557, 568, 569; United States v. Jones, 109
U. S. 513, 518; Boom Co. v. Patterson,98 U. S. 403, 406.'
The authority to condemn is not negatived or affected by
the limit set upon cost in the authorization of the Secretary to purchase.
The Acts of July 25,1912, and of August 1, 1888, make
it obvious that the Secretary of War was authorized to
acquire the property by purchase or condemnation. The
authority to condemn. conferred by the last mentioned
act extends to every case in which an officer of the Government is authorized to procure real estate for public
uses. See United States vi Beaty, 198 Fed. 284 (reviewed

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

261 U. S.

Plaintiff in error contends that the court erred in receiving in evidence the resolutions of the directors, in
giving to the jury the instru ctions following:
"Coming to consider the value. You have heard what
it cost to dig, what it would cost to dig it now, this contract that they made to sell it, and the reasons that induced them to make the contract. All that evidence you
will consider.
"Now you are not. bound by the $65,000 that' they
agreed to; if you think they. ought to get more than that,
why you can award them more than that. If you think
they ought to get less than that, you can award them
less."
and also in holding that the verdict is supported by the
evidence.
There were two principal issues of fact: (1) the necessity of. taking the strip of land three hundred feet wide,
inclusive of the canal, and (2) the amount of compensation to which the owner was entitled.
The resolutions hereinbefore mentioned stated that it
is necessary for the United States to have and own a
right of way three hundred feet in width in order to
improve and enlarge said canal and make the same a part
of the said inland waterway, that the United States- had
agreed to purchase the property from the company for
$65,000, and authforized the conveyance of the same to
the United States upon payment of that sum, possession
to be retained until the purchase price was actually paid,
and the right to cut trees thereon for a specified time, and
right of ingress and egress from lateral canals to be
reserved.
Two grounds of objection are urged: (1) that the issue
of necessity was cognizable in equity and that the court,
sitting as a chancellor, should have determined the equity
issue prior to the trial of the law issue, and (2) that the
resolutions offered in evidence constitute, and tend

Opinion of the Court.

merely to prove, an attempt to compromise. The resolutions contained a distinct admission of fact that it was
necessary to take -the strip of land in question. This
admission was made for the purpose of showing the right
of the Secretary of War to purchase the property. They
were admissible in evidence for that purpose. The judge
rightly decided at the trial that the taking was for a public purpose and the Government had a right to take.
The only question submitted to the -jury was the
amount the owner was entitled to receive for the property. At the time of the adoption of the resolutions,
-condemnation pr'oceedings had not been commenced;
they were voluntarily adopted; the specified price was
. fixed with perfect freedom; they show a completed agreement of purchase and sale; and there is no reason why
they should not be considered as the owner's admission
of the then value of the property. The company had opportunity to and did introduce' evidence in explanation of
the circumstances -attending the adoption and the fixing
of the price therein. The court did not err in receiving
the evidence on the question of fact submitted to the
jury. Seaboard Air Line.Ry. v. Chamblin, 108 Va. 42;
O'Malley v. Commonwealth, 182 Mass. 196; Montana
Tonopah Mining Co. v. Dunlap,196 Fed. 612, 617; Spring
Valley Waterworks v. San Francisco, i92 Fed. "137, 164;
City of.Springfield v. Schmook, 68 Mo. 394; Froysell v.
Lewelyn (Eng.), 9 Price, 122; 147 Reprint, 41.
The court instructed the jury to consider what it did
cost and what it would cost now to dig the canal, the
reasons that induced the company to make the contract,
and that in reaching a verdict they were not bound by the
$65,000 agreed upon, and might find an- amount greater
or -less .than that. The objections urged against the
charge are not well founded.
The evidence tended to show that the original cost of
the canal was $65,000, and that it wiould cost $152,000 to

the canal, and its suitability for use, together with the
condition of the property. It cannot be said the verdict
for $65,000 is without support. Erie R. R. Co. v. Winter,
