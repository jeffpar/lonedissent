THE PUSEY & JONES COMPANY v. HANSSEN.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
THIRD CIRCUIT.
No. 431.

Argued February 27, 1923.-Decided April 9, 1923.

1. In the absence of a statute, a suit for a receiver of an insolvent
corporation cannot be maintained in the District Court by an unsecured simple contract creditor. P. 497.
2. A remedial right to proceed in a federal court in equity cannot be
enlarged by a state statute. P. 497.
3. Section 3883 of the Revised Code of Delaware, 1915, empowering
the Chancellor to appoint a receiver for an insolvent corporation,
"on the application and for the benefit of any creditor," etc.,
does not confer upon the creditor a substantive right but merely
provides a new remedy, which cannot affect proceedings of the.
federal courts in equity. P. 498.
4. A decree confirming and continuing a receivership of a corporation, entered without equity jurisdiction on the application of a
simple unsecured contract creditor, could not be cured by the mere
intervention afterwards of another party claiming to be a creditor
with a mortgage lien on the corporation's property. P. 501.

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Argument for Respondent.

261 U. S.

The question of the jurisdiction of a federal court to
proceed under the Delaware statute at the instance of a
creditor who has not reduced his claim to judgment is
not determinative of this proceeding, for two reasons:
(1) The respondent was a stockholder, as well as a creditor, and, as such, could proceed unhampered by any of
the obstacles urged by the petitioner; (2) the intervention of the United States Shipping Board Emergency
Fleet Corporation injected a party that had a direct lien
upon all of the valuable real estate owned by the petitioner.
It is claimed that the proceedings were so defective that
they could not be perfected by a subsequent intervention.
But the lower court had full jurisdiction over the original
parties and over the subject-matter of the proceeding,
any defect arising from the fact that the complainant had
not reduced his claim to judgment being one that could
be waived. And the proceeding was legitimately in court,
if for no other purpose than that of enforcing the transfer
of the preferred stock to the complainant's, name. The
petitioner's contention in this behalf seems to be in effect
that there was no proceeding and therefore none in which
the Emergency Fleet Corporation could intervene. This
is not the situation for the above reasons, if for no others.
Furthermore, it is not true that a defect of jurisdiction
arising from the lack of capacity of a party may not be
cured by the intervention of a party properly qualified.
This was a class action, brought for the benefit of all
stockholders and creditors. If the original complainant.
cannot qualify, the proceedings are perfected by the intervention of one of the prescribed class who can qualify..

Will, 21 Wall. 503; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v.
Western Union Tel. Co., 234 U. S. 369; Greeley v. Lowe,
155 U. S. 58. The only inquiry here is whether this statute creates a new right or remedy, equitable in character,
applicable to a situation for which there was no adequate
and complete legal remedy.
The statute creates a new right, namely, the right to a
receivership solely upon the insolvency of a corporation.
Jones v. Mutual Fidelity Co., 123 Fed. 506.
The right to a receivership is a substantial right and
oftentimes constitutes the only means of saving both the
creditors and stockholders immense values in the possession of insolvent corporations. The argument that ho
such relief is permissible as the only and ultimate relief
prayed for in a proceeding, is sufficiently answered by
reference to the many.cases in the federal courts in which
that relief only has been requested and granted. The
right is, of course, equitable. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal &
Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371; Williamson v. Wilson, 1 Bland's
Ch. (Md.) 418.
The District Court in the District of Delaware has proceeded for many years upon the above principles in the
enforcement of this statute. Wheeler v. Walton & Whann

The complainant had no adequate remedy at law and
the decision affording him relief was correct.
Nh. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Section 3883 of the Revised Code of Delaware, 1915
(which embodies the Act of March 25, 1891, c. 181, 19
Del. Laws, p. 359) provides:
"Whenever a corporation shall b6 insolvent, the Chancellor, on the application and for the benefit of any creditor or stockholder thereof, may, at any time, in his discretion, appoint one or more persons to be receivers of
and for such corporation, to take charge of the estate,
effects, business and affairs thereof, and to collect the outstanding debts, claims, and property due and belonging
to the company, with power to prosecute and defend, in
the name of the corporation or otherwise; all claims or
suits, to appoint an agent or agents under them, and to
do all other acts which might be done by such corporation
and may be necessary and proper; the powers of such
receivers to be such and continued so long as the Chan-

cellor shall think necessary; provided, however, that the
provisions of this Section shall not apply to corporations
for public improvement."
Whether the federal court sitting i equity has, by reason of the above statute, jurisdiction to appoint a receiver
of an insolvent Delaware corporation upon application of
an unsecured simple contract creditor is the main question
1
presented.
Invoking the power conferred by the statute, Hanssen,
a subject of Norway, brought in the federal court for the
District of Delaware this suit in equity against The Pusey
& Jones Company, a corporation organized under the
general laws of that State. The bill, which was prosecuted on behalf of all ceditors and stockholders, alleged
that the corporation was insolvent; that plaintiff was a
creditor, holding promissory notes issued by it; and that
he was also a stockholder. It prayed that a receiver be
It will be assumed that the Vords "any creditor" as used in the
statute include an unsecured simple contract creditor, it was so held
by the District Court and by' the Circuit Court of Appeals in this
case, 276 Fed. 296; 279 Fed. 488; and it had been previously so held
in the District Court. Jones v. Mutual Fidelity Co., 123 Fed. 506.
The question, which is one of construction, does not appear to have
been expressly decided by the courts of Delaware. The reported
cases do not disclose that it has been raised in the state courts. In
those cases in which jurisdiction was taken, the plaintiff was apparently a stockholder, Thoroughgood v. Georgetown Water Co., 9 Del.
Ch. 84; Ross v. South Delaware Gas Co., 10 Del. Ch. 236; Sill v.

appointed.2 The bill was filed on June 9, 1921; receivers
were appointed ex parte;and an order issued that the defendant show cause, on June 18, why the receivers should
not be continued during the pendency of the'cause. On
June 11, the defendant moved to vacate the receivership.
The motion was denied. Then, by answer, the defendant
objected that the court had no jurisdiction either at law
or in equity; denied that.plaintiff was either a creditor or
a stockholder; denied that defendant was insolvent; and
asserted that defendant was entitled under the Federal
Constitution to have determined in an action at law the
question whether plaintiff was a creditor.
Upon a hearing of the order to .show cause, had on bill,
answer, affidavits and exhibits, a decree was entered confirming the appointment of the receivers and continuing
them pendente lite, 276 Fed. 296. This decree was
affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for *the Third
Circuit, 279 Fed. 488. Neither the District Court, nor
the Cipiit Court of Appeals, passed upon the question
whethei..Hanssen was a stockholder. Both courts held
that, by reason of the state statute, the federal court sitting in equity had jurisdiction and power to appoint a
receiver of a Delaware corporation upon application of a
simple contract creditor, whose cliim had not been reduced to judgment and who had no lien upon the corporate property. Both courts held that the controverted
question whether the plaintiff was a creditor could be
determined in the equity suit. And both held (upon the
evidence submitted by affidavit) that the plaintiff was a
creditor. The case is here on writ of certiorari.
'It prayed, also, that the defendant be directed to issue to plaintiff
a certificate for the stock which he claimed to own; and that the
receiver be directed to institute appropriate proceedings to set aside
a large judgment recently entered against defendant in that court,
which was alleged to have been recovered collusively. The answer
denied the collusion,

PUSEY & JONES CO. v. RANSSEN.

497

Opinion of the Court.

That this suit could not be maintained in the absence
of the statute is clear. A receiver is often appointed upon
application of a secured creditor who fears that his security will be wasted. -Kountze v. Omaha Hotel Co., 107
U. S. 378, 395. A receiver is often appointed upon application of a judgment creditor who has exhausted his legal
remedy. See White v. Ewing; 159 U S. 36. But an unsecured simple contract creditor has, in the absence of..
statute, no substantive right, legal or equitable, in or to
the property of his debtor. This is true, whatever the
nature of the property; and, although the. debtor is a corporation and insolvent. The only substantive right of a
.simple contract creditor is to have his debt paid in due
course. His adjective right is, ordinarily, at law. He has
no right whatsoever in equity until he has exhausted his
legal remedy. After execution upon a judgment recovered at law has been returned unsatisfied he may proceed
in equity by a creditor's bill. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal
& Iron Co., 150 U. S. 371; Compare Swan Land & Cattle
Co. v. Frank, 148 U. S. 603; National Tube Works Co. v.
Ballou, 146 U. S. 517; Pierce v. United States, 255 U. S.
398, 403. He may, by such a bill, remove any obstacle to
satisfying his execution at law; or may reach assets equitable in their nature; or he may provisionally protect his
debtor's property from misappropriation or waste, by
means either of an injunction or a receiver. Whether the
debtor be an individual or a corporation, the appointment
of a receiver is merely an ancillary and incidental remedy.
A receivership is not final relief. The appointment determines no substantive right; nor is it a step in the
determination of such a right. It is a means of preserving
property which may ultimately be applied toward the
satisfaction of substantive rights.
That a remedial right to proceed in a federal court sitting in equity cannot be enlarged by a state statute is likewise clear, Scott v. Neely, 140 U. S. 106; Cates v. Allen,

149 U. S. 451. Nor can it be so narrowed, Mississippi
Mills v. Cohn, 150 U. S. 202; Guffey v. Smith, 237 U. S.
101, 114. The federal court may therefore be obliged'to
deny an equitable remedy which the plaintiff might have
secured in a state court.' Hanssen's contention is that the
statute does not enlarge the equitable jurisdiction or remedies; and that it confers upon creditors of a Delaware
corporation, if the company is insolvent, a substantive
equitable right to have a'receiver appointed. If this were
true, the right conferred could be enforced in the federal
courts, Scott v. Neely, -140.U.-S. 106, 109; 4 since the proceeding is in plesding and .practice conformable to those
commonly entertained by a court of equity.. But it is not
true that this statute confers upon the creditor a substantive right." .:The Bankruptcy Act of July 1, 1898, c.
541, §§ 3, 18,'30 Stat. 544, 546, 551,- does confer upon

creditors.of a corporation (or individual) the right, under
certain conditions, to have the property of an insolvent"
debtbr taken possession of"and administered by an officer
".of the court. Compare Acme Harvester Co. v. Beekman
Lumber Co., 222 U. S. 300, 309,-310; Vulcan Sheet Metal
Co. v. North Platte Valley Irrigation Co., 220 Fed. 106.
The Delaware statute does not confer upon creditors the
right to have a receiver appointed, although the insolvency
*of the corporation may be palpable, hopeless and attended
by indisputable fraud or mismanagement. - Insolvency is
made a condition of the Chancellor's jurisdiction; but it
doesnot give rise to any substantive right in the creditor.
Jones v. Maxwell Motor Co., 115 AtI. (Del.) 312, 314, 315.
It makes possible a new remedy because it confers upon
the Chancellor a new power. Whether that power is visitorial, (as the petitioner insists) or whether it is strictly
judicial, need not be determined in this case. Whatever
its exact nature, the power enables the Chancellor to
afford a remedy which theretofore would not have been
open to an unsecured. simple contract creditor. But because that which the statute confers is merely a remedy,
the-statute cannot affect proceedings in the federal courts
sitting in equity.
The case is wholly unlike Louisville & Nashville R. R.
Co. v..Western Union Telegraph Co., 234 U. S. 369; and
other cases in which federal courts, because of a state statute, entertained suits to remove a cloud upon title, which
otherwise'-must have been dismissed. In those cases, as
pdinted out in Clark v. Smith, i3 Pet. 195, 203, the statute
changed a rule of substantive law. For instance, a statute
provides that a-deed, void on its face, shall be deemed a
cloud, whereas theretofore it 'was-not. It declares "what
shall form a cloud on titles." As stated in Reynolds v.
Crawfordsville First National Bank, 112 U. S. 405, 410,
the federal court looks "to the legislation of the State in
which the cQurt sits [and the land is situated] to ascer-

61 U. S.

tain what constitutes a cloud upon the title, and what
the state laws declare to be such the courts of the United
States sitting in equity have jurisdiction to remove." In
such cases, as the statute confers upon the landowner a
substantive right, he is entitled to the aid of the federal
court for its enforcement. But where a state statute relating to clouds upon title is held merely to enlarge the
equitable remedy, it will not support a bill in equity in
the federal court. Thus, in Whitehead v. Shattuck, 138
U. S. 146, the statute relied upon authorized a suit in
equity by one out of possession against one in possession.
As an action at law in the nature of ejectment afforded
an adequate legal remedy, the bill to quiet title was dismissed.
The case at bar is also unlike Re MetropolitanRailway
Receivership, 208 U. S.90, 109, 110, and many others, in
which there was express consent by the corporation to the
appointment of the receiver, or where the indebtedness
to plaintiff and the corporation's insolvency were admitted, or the lack of jurisdiction in equity was waived.
The objection that the bill does not make a case properly
cognizable in a court of equity does not go to its jurisdiction as a federal court. Smith v. McKay, 161 U. S.355;
Blythe v. Hinckley, 173 U. S. 501. The objection may, as
pointed out in Reynes v. Dumont, 130 U. S. 354, 395, be
taken by the court of its wn motion. But, unlike lack of
jurisdiction as a federal court, Mansfield, Coldwater &
Lake Michigan Ry. Co. v. Swan, 111 U. S.379, 382, lack
of equity jurisdiction (if not objected to by a defendant)
may be ignored by the court, in cases where the subjectmatter of the suit is of a class of which a court of equity
has jurisdiction. And where the defendant has expressly
consented to action by the court or has failed to object
seasonably, the objection will be treated as waived.

491

Dissent.

U. S. 341, 349. In cases relied upon by respondent there
was such waiver. But, here, the company strenuously
insisted throughout upon the absence of jurisdiction and
denied every material allegation on which it is sought to
support the bill.
Respondent contends that, even if there was originally
lack of equity jurisdiction, the defect was cured on October 8, 1921, when the intervention of the United States
Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation was filed
and allowed. That corporation claimed to be a creditor
and to have a mortgage lien on all the real estate of The
Pusey & Jones Company. The contention is that the
original defect in jurisdiction was thus cured, because the
existence of a direct lien gives equity jurisdiction for the
appointment of receivers, unhampered by the obstacles
that confront unsecured simple contract creditors. The
contention is clearly unsound; among other reasons, because the intervention did not occur until two months
after entry of the decree here under review.
Respondent contends, also, that even if there was no
jurisdiction of the suit as a creditor's bill, it should be
sustained now as a stockholder's bill. The answer denied
that Hanssen was or ever had been a stockholder; denied
that any certificate of stock ever had been assigned or
transferred to him; denied that any certificate ever became his property; and denied that he was the holder or
owner of any stock. The bill prayed that the corporation be directed to issue to plaintiff a certificate for the
stock which he claims to own. Both the District Court
and the Circuit Court of Appeals left undetermined this
claim that he was or should be made a stockholder. We
do not decide it. And we have no occasion to consider
whether the bill could be sustained, if Hanssen proved tb
be a stockholder.
