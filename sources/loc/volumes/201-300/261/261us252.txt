RANDALL ET AL. v. BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
OF TIPPECANOE COUNTY, INDIANA.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF INDIANA.

No. 274. Argued January 25, 1923.-Decided February 19, 1923.
A writ of error to the highest court of a State must be dismissed
when the judgment is one of an intermediate court which the
highest court has declined to review for want of jurisdiction.
Writ of error to review 131 N. E. 776, dismissed.

Mr. Otto Gresham for plaintiffs in error.
Mr. Clyde H. Jones, with whom Mr. D. P. Flanagan
was on the brief, for defendant in error.
Memorandum opinion by MR. JusTICE SUTHERLAND.
This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Indiana,
'when, clearly, it should have been to the State Appellate
Court.
The action was brought in the Superior Court for Tippecanoe County. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained. An appeal was allowed to the Supreme Court
but that court, of its own motion, entered an order transferring the cause to the Appellate Court, for want of
jurisdiction. The Appellate Court thereupon took the
case, received the briefs of counsel, heard oral arguments
and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. A petition
for rehearing was submitted and denied. Plaintiffs in
error then applied to the Supreme Court for an order to
vacate its former order of transfer, or, in the alternative,
for a writ of error coram nobis, which the Supreme Court
denied.
It therefore appears that the Supreme Court refused to
take the case on appeal for want oOf: jurisdiction, and the
judgment of the highest court of the State in which a deci-

IN EQUITY.

No. 25, Original.

Argued on motion to dismiss January 2, 1923.Decided February 19, 1923.

1. The right to priority of payment provided for by Rev. Stats.,
§ 3466, attaches when the conditions specified by the section come
into existence; and it cannot be impaired or superseded by a
state law. P. 259.
2. The State of Oklahoma acquires no lien on the assets of a state
bank under § 303 of c. 6, Rev. Laws Okla. 1910, before possession of the bank has been taken by the state bank commissioner. P. 260.
3. The word "insolvent," as used in Rev. Stats., -§ 3466, and the
Bankruptcy Law, applies only where a debtor's property is insufficient to pay all his debts. P. 260.
4. But "insolvent," in the sense of the Oklahoma statute, supra,
where it authorizes the bank commissioner, upon becoming satisfied
of a bank's insolvency, -to take possession and wind up its affairs,
is a broader term, applicable where a bank is unable to pay
depositors in the ordinary course of business, though its assets may
exceed its debts. Id.
5. Such a taking over of a bank by the act of the coamissioner
upon a finding by him of its insolvency, does not establish the
right of the United States to priority of payment under Rev.
Stats., § 3466. because it does not imply insolvency within the
