unless he took what the testator already had. We should
not have derived that notion from the section, which
seems to us to have the broad intent that we have expressed, and the words specially applicable seem to ud
plainly to -import that if there is no widow or child the
executor may exercise the power that the testator might
have exercised if he had been alive. The executor represents the person of his testator, Littleton, ยง 237, and

Nos. 143-148, and 149.

Argued December 4, 5, 1922.--Decided
March 12, 1923.

1. A State may tax that part of the property of a carrier engaged in
interstate and local business which is permanently located or commonly used within the State, according to its fair value as part of
a going concern, measured with reference to the gross receipts from
both local and interstate business. P. 338.
2. A tax, measured in this way, which is called a property tax, which
is imposed in lieu of all other taxes upon the carrier's property in

the State, which is not in excess of what would be a legitimate tax

on such property, valued as part of a going concern, nor' relatively
higher than 'taxes on other classes of property, does not discriminate against interstate commerce. P. 339.
3. A state statutory provision'that a foreign corporation failing .to
pay a tax shall be excluded from doing business in the State would
be void as ajplied to interstate commerce. P. 339.
4. The tax here involved, based on the California Constitution (Art.
XIII, ยง 14, as amended, 1910) and on subsequent statutes, was
not intended to reach income from property situated or business
done outside of the State. P. 340.

cases, the taxes were paid while the business of the Company was under feaeral control, -and the action brought
by the Company and the Director General of Railroads.
Mr. Cordenio A. Severance, with whom Mr. Gustavus
A. Fernald and Mr. Burke Corbet were on the brief, for
plaintiffs in error.
There is no doubt that a State is entitled to- tax instrumentalities of interstate commerce within the State
and that, in so doing, it may take into account "intangible values" accruing from their Use as part of a unit
system of transportation. The so-called unit system of
taxation approved in Adams Express Co. v. Ohio,. 165
U. S. 227, and other cases, need' only be referred to. It is
but one method of ascertaining a fair. valuation of the
property taxed. Gross-receipts or gross-earnings systems
of taxation may be used as a method of arriving at the
same result; but the State may not tax interstate commerce itself, or the earnings therefrom, or property situated without the State'; and if, under the circumstances,
the tax may'be said to be so directly aimed at interstate

earnings as to evidence an intention to levy upon them,
as such, the tax will be declared void as an unlawful burden upon interstate commerce. In determining this question, the controlling matter is not the expressed intention
of the legislature, nor the manner in which the law is administered, but the effect of the act.
The difficulty has been in applying the foregoing principles to the particular case.
However, the expressed intention of the legislature, as
well as the manner in which the law is administered, may
be, and should be, considered to such extent as it is or may
be an indication' that the gross receipts are aimed at and
the purpose of such aim, in a particular case.

This tax is aimed so directly at gross receipts as to constitute an unlawful burden on interstate commerce and a
tax upon the income-of property and business without the
State.
No reference was made to the value of the property in
ascertaining the tax. The theoretical method alleged to
haye been adopted by the Tax Commission for determining whether the gross receipts tax is equivalent to an ad
valorem tax is fallacious and misleading.
The situation isexactly like that in Fargo v. Michigan,

protest as state taxes. Each action related to a designated part of the tax for a distinct year and was brought
on the theory that the part designated was invalid because
imposed under constitutional and statutory provisions repugnant to the Constitution of the United- States. The
Treasurer prevailed in the court, of first instance and in
the Supreme Court of the State. 185 Cal. 484. The
Pullman Company then brought the cases here on writs
Z
of error.
In 1910 California adopted an amendment to her constitution, ยง 14 of Article XIII, one purpose of which was
to effect a separation of state from local taxation by subjecting public service corporations to a designated tax for
state purposes and relieving them from taxation for
county and municipal purposes. Referring to this feature
of the amendment, the Supreme Court of the State said
in San Francisco v. Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co.,
166 Cal. 244, 248: "Under the old system, the property
and franchises of the corporations above referred to were
taxed for both state and local purposes. The amendment
creates a new mode of taxing such property and franchises, and appropriates the revenue so raised to state
purposes solely. The new method, by which taxes are
collected exclusively for the state, is substituted for the
former system, under which the same subjects were taxed
for both state and local purposes."
The pertinent parts of the amendment are, as follows
(Laws 1910-11, p. xliv):
"Sec. 14 (a). . . . all sleeping car, dining car,
drawing-room car, and palace car companies, . .
operating upon-the railroads in this State; . . . shall
annually pay to the State a tax upon their franchises,
. . . rolling stock, . . . and other property, or
any part thereof used exclusively in the operation of their
business in this State, computed as follows: Said tax
shall be equal to the percentages hereinafter fixed upon

PULLMAN CO. v. RICHARDSON.
330

Opinion of the Court.

the gross receipts from operation of such companies and
each thereof within this State. When such companies are
operating partly within and partly without this State, the
gross receipts within this State shall be deemed to be 'all
receipts on business .beginning and ending within this
State, and a proportion, based .upon the proportion of the
mileage within'this State to the' entire mileage over which
such business is done, of receipts on all business passing
through, into, or out of this State.
"The percentages above mentioned shall be as follows:
... . on all sleeping car dining car, drawing-room car,
palace car companies;
. .
three per cent; ; . .
Such taxes shall be in lieu of all other taxes and licenses,
State, county and municipal, upon the property above
enumerated of such companies except as otherwise in this
section provided;
"(e) . . . In the event that the above named revenues are at any time deemed insufficient to meet the
annual expenditures of the State, including the above
named expenditures for educational purposes, there may
be levied, in the manner to be provided by law, a tax, for
State purposes, on'all the property in the State, including
the classes of property enumerated in this section, sufficient to meet the deficiency.
"(f) All the provisions of this section shall: be selfexecuting,'and the Legislature shall pass all laws necessary
to carry this section into effect, and shall provide for a
valuation and assessment of the property enumerated in
this section, . . . The rates of taxation fixed in this
section shall remain in force until changed by the Legislature, two thirds of all the members elected to each of
the two houses voting in favor thereof."
Several acts to carry the amendment into effect were
adopted from time to time, but it suffices here to say of
them, first, that the computing percentage applicable to
sleeping car, dining car, drawing-room car, and palace car

companies was increased to four per cent. in 1913 (c. 6,
Laws 1913) and reduced to three and ninety-five hundredths per cent. in 1915 (c. 2, Laws 1915); secondly, that
provision was made for enforcing the tax by either the
usual tax sale or a suit in the name of the State (c. 335,
ยงยง 20, 21, 24, Laws 1910-11; c. 6, ยง 5, Laws 1913), and,
thirdly, that there was further provision that if the tax
was not paid within a designated period the delinquent
company, if a domestic corporation, "will forfeit its
charter" and, if a foreign corporation; "will forfeit its
right to do business in this State," and that the transaction of any business in the State on behalf of a company.
incurring any such forfeiture, except to settle its affairs,
should be punished by substantial fines. Laws 1911,
c. 335, ยง 24; Laws 1913, c. 6, ยง 5, and c. 320, ยง 9.
The taxes in question were levied under the new system
in 1911 and six subsequent years. All were alike, save in
particulars not material here; so it will be enough to state
the facts relating to the tax levied in 1911.
The Pullman Company is an Illinois corporatiqn engaged in operating sleeping and parlor cars on the railroads of the country. Some of its cars are operated between points in California, some between points within
and points without that State and some through the State
between points outside. In 1910 the company's gross receipts from all its operations within the State were
$1,905,302.97. Of this sum $938,786.80 came from operations which began and ended in the State and $966,516.17
came from that part of the interstate operations which
was withtn the State. The latter amount was arrived at
by taking every service performed partly within and
partly without the State and determining on a mileage
basis what portion- of the sum received therefor was attributable to the part of the service within the State. To
illustrate: If a passenger was carried in a sleeping car
from Oakland to Chicago for $14.00, and one-seventh of

PULLMAN CO. v. RICHARDSON.
.330

Opinion of the Court.

the mileage was in California, $2.00 was deemed the gross
-receipt for so much of the service as was rendered in that
State.
The gross receipts were calculated and reported by the
company and the state officers accepted the calculation.
The amount of the tax was computed by applying to the
gross receipts the percentage rule prescribed by the
amendment to the state constitution. 'In this way a tax
of $57,159.08 was levied in 1911. Had the gross receipts
from intrastate business alone been considered the tax
would have been $28,163.61,-that is, $28,995.47 less than
the actual levy.
The company objected to the consideration of the
*gross receipts from the interstate business, although they
came only from service within the State, and objected to a
corresponding part of the tax--the $28,995.47. That part
was paid under protest and the first of these actions was
brought to recover it,-an admissible course under the
state law. Laws 1910-1911, c. 335, ยง 23; Laws 1913,
c. 320, ยง 7. The other part was paid voluntarily and is
not in controversy.
The company insists that the tax in question and the
provisions therefor in the state constitution and statutes
are invalid under the commerce clause of the Constitution
of the United States, because (a) the' tax is laid on gross
receipts from interstate commerce, and (b) its payment is
made a condition to continuing an interstate business
within the State, and are invalid under the due process of
law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because the tax
* is intended to reach income from property situated and
business done without- the State.
The state court holds that the tax is not a tax on gross
receipts as such, but is in both name and essence a tax on
property *ithin the State, and that it iscomputed with
reference to the gRoss receipts only as a means. of adjust-

ing it tjo the real value of the property in the relation in
which the same is used.
The principles to be applied in cases of this class repeatedly have been considered by this court and are now
'settled.
A State can neither tax the act of engaging in interstate commerce nor lay a tax on gross receipts therefrom.
In either case the tax would be a restraint or burden on
such commerce and its imposition an invasion of the
power of regulation confided to Congress by the commerce clause of the Constitution. Fargov. Michigan, 121
U. S. 230; Philadelphia& Southern S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326; Galveston, Harrisburg& San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217; Meyer v. Wells,
Fargo & Co., 223 U. S. !98.
The rule is otherwise with property used in interstate
commerce. A State within whose limits such property is
permanently located or commonly used may tax it. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, 246 U. S. 450, 453; Wells,
Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, 248 U. S. 165, 167; Union Tank
Line Co. v. Wright, 249 U. S. 275, 282. And, if the property be part of a system and have an augmented value by
reason of a connected operation of the whole, it may be
taxed according to its value as part of the system, although the other parts be outside the State;-in other
words, the tax may be made to-cover the enhanced value
which comes to the property in the State through its
organic relation to the system. Fargo v. Hart, 193 U. S.
490, 499; Galveston, Harrisburg& San*,Antonio Ry. Cd.
v. Texas, supra,p. 225; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, 223 U. S. 335, 337; Union Tank Line Co. v.
Wright, supra.
In taxing property so situated and used. a State may
*select and employ any appropriate means of reaching its
actual or full value as part of a going concern,-such as
'treating the gross receipts from its use in both intrastate

PULLMAN CO. v' RICHARDSON.
330

Opinion of the Court.

and interstte commerce as an index or measure of its
value,-and if the means do not involve any discrimination against interstate commerce and the tax amounts to
no more than what would be legitimate as an ordinary tax
upon the property, valued with reference to its use, the
tax is not open to attack as restraining or burdening such
commerce. Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, supra;
St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, 235 U. S.
350, 367; United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, supra;
Galveston, Harrisburg& San Antonio Ry. Co. v. Texas,
supra, p. 227; Union Tank Line Co. vi Wright, supra.
An examination of the tax in question in the light of
these principles shows that the chief objection urged
against it is not tenable. The provisions under which the
tax is imposed call it a property tax, specify the property
subjected to it and declare that it is in lieu of all other
taxes on such property. The Supreme Court of the State
holds it is a tax on'the property stecified. In.no material
respect does it differ from the tax which was recognized
by this Court as a property tax in United States Express
Co. v. Minnesota and Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minfiesota,
above cited. True, it is computed with special regard to
the gross receipts, but this, as is fairly shown, is done
merely as a means of getting at the full value of the property, considering its nature and use. The tax is not
claimed to be in excess of what would be legitimate as
an ordinary tax on the property valued as part of a going
concern, nor to be relatively higher than the taxes on
other kinds of property. There is no ground for thinking
that it operates as a discrimination against interstate
commerce.
The statutory jrovision that a foreign corporatioh
which fails to pay the tax shall be excluded from doing
business in the State requires but brief notice. ft is not
sought to be enforced here. The Pullman Company has
not failed to pay the tax. The provision has not been

construed by the state court. If it be construed as covering interstate commerce it is void, for the right to engage
in such commerce is not within the State's control. See
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, 125 U. S.
530, 554; Leloup v. Port of Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, 645;
Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688, 695696. The state court may construe it as confined to
intrastate business. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v.
Arkansas, 235 U. S. 350, 368-369. In neither event would
it affect the validity of the tax before us.
We find nothing in the provisions under which the tax
was levied, in the decision of the state court, or in the
record, which gives any support to the contention that
the tax is intended to reach income from property situated
or business done without the State.
