Four of these orders were held invalid by the circuit, courts
of appeals for the third and seventh circuits in the above
entitled causes-276 Fed. 686; 282 Fed. 81; and like ones
have been set aside by the circuit courts of appeals for the
second and sixth circuits-Standard Oil- Co. v. Federal

essential facts and points of law disclosed by the four records now before isare so similar that it will suffice to consider No. 213, as typical of all.
July 18, 1919, the Commission issued a complaint
charging that respbident, Sinclair Refining Company, was
purchasing and selling refined oil and gasoline and leasing
and loaning storage tanks and pumps as part of interstate
commerce in competition with numerous other concerns
similarly engaged; and that it was violating both the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 717, and the Clayton
Act, 38 Stat. 730.
The particular facts relied on to show violation of the
Federal Trade Commission Act are thus alleged"Paragraph Three. That respondent in the conduct of
its business, as aforesaid, with the effect of stifling and
suppressiig. competition in the sale, of the aforesaid products and in the sale, leasing, or loaning of the aforesaid devices and other equipments for storing and handling the
same, and with the effect of injuring competitors who sell
such products and devices, has within the four years last
past sold, leased, or loaned and now sells, leases, or loans
the said devices and their equipment for prices or considerations which do not represent reasonable returns on the
investments in such devices and their equipments; that
many such sales, leases, or loans of the aforesaid devices
are made at prices below the cost of producing and vend-

ing the same; that many of such contracts for the lease or
loan of such devices and their equipments provide or are
entered into with the understanding that the lessee or
borrower shall not place in such devices, or use in connection with such devices and their equipments, any refined oil or gasoline of a competitor; that only a small
proportion of the dealers in gasoline and refined oil under
such agreements and understandings deal also in similar
products of respondent's competitors and that only a
small proportion of such dealers require or use more than
a single pump outfit in the conduct of their said business;
tht there are numerous competitors in the sale of such
products who are unable to enter into such lease agreements or understandings because of the large amount of
investment required to carry out such lease agreements
as a competitive method of selling refined oil and gasolie; that there are numerous other competitors of respondent engaged in the manufacture and sale of devices and their equipments who do not deal in refined oil
and gasoline, and therefore do not sell or lease said devices
and their. equipments for a nominal consideration on a
condition or understanding that their products only are
to be used therein; that the said numerous competitors
who were unable to enter into such lease agreements or
understandings, as aforesaid, have lost numerous customers in the sale of refined oil and gasoline to respondent
b1ecause of the business practices of respondent hereinbefore set forth. 'That the said numerous other competitors
of respondent who manufacture and sell said devices.and
their equipments, but do not, sell refined oil and gasoline,
as aforesaid, have* lost numerous customers and pros-'

their equipments to be used within the United States, and
has fixed and is now fixing the price charged therefor on

Respondent answered and evidence was taken. In
October, 1919, the Commission announced its report, findings and conclusions, the substance of which follows.
"1. That the respondent is a corporation organized,
existing, and doing business under and by virtue of the
laws of the State of Maine, with its principal business
office located at the City of .Chicago, in the State of Illinois, and is now and has been engaged in the business of
purchasing and selling refined oil and gasoline, hereinafter referred to as products, and is largely engaged in
refining crude petroleum, and that it is now and has been
since January 25, 1917, in connection with the aforementioned business, engaged in the leasing and loaning, but
not in the manufacture, of oil pumps, storage tanks, and
containers and their equipment, hereinafter referred to
as devices, in various States of the United States, but not
in the District of Columbia, in competition with numerous other persons, firms, corporations, and copartnerships
similarly engaged; that prior to the 25th day of January,
1917, the corporate name of respondent was the Cudahy
Refining Company.
"2. That the respondent, in the conduct of its business,
as aforesaid, and as hereinafter more particularly de-

selling, leasing or loaning such devices, the, same are constantly moved from one State to another by respondent
and there is Conducted by respondent a constant current

respondent do not represent reasonable returns upon the

investment in such devices and equipment; and also that

whatever means effected, the lessee may purchase the

"4. That the contracts mentioned in the preceding
paragraph also provide that such equipments shall be
used by the lessee only for the purpose of holding and

proportion of such lessees handle similar products of respondent's competitors; and that only a small proportion
of such lessees as handle similar products of respondent's
competitors require or use more than a single pump outfit
in the conduct of their said business; that the practice of
leasing such devices requires a large capital investment;
that many competitors of respondent do not possess sufficient capital and are not able to purchase and lease devices as respondent does as Aforesaid, partly by reason of
which such competitors have lost numerous customers to
respondent; that the effect of the practice of leasing by
contract such equipments, where such contracts contain
the said provision restricting the use of the same to the
storage and handling of respondent's products as aforesaid, may be to substantially lessen competition and tend
to create for the respondent a monoply in the business of
selling petroleum products.
" Conclusions. That the methods of competition and
the business practices set forth in the foregoing findings
as to the facts are, under the circumstances set forth
herein, unfair methods of competition, in interstate commerce, in violation of the provisions of section 5 of an act
of Congress, approved September 26, 1914, entitled 'An

Opinion of the Court.

261 U. S.

Thereupon the Commission ordered that respondent
cease and desist from"1. Directly or indirectly leasing .pumps or tanks or
both and their equipments for storing and handling petroleum products in the furtherance of its petroleum business, at ,a rental which will not yield to it a, reasonable
profit on the cost of the same after making due allowance
for depreciation and other items usually considered when
leasing property for the purpose of obtaining a reasonable
profit therefrom, and from doing any matter or thing
which would have the same unlawful effect as that resulting from the practice herein prohibited and by reason
of which this order is made.
"2. Entering into contracts or agreements with dealers
of its petroleum products or from continuing to operate
under any contract or agreement already entered into
whereby such dealers agree or have an understanding that
as a consideration for the leasing to them of such pumls
and tanks and their equipments the same shall be used
only for storing or handling the products of respondent,
and from doing anything having the same unlawful effect
as that resulting from the practice herein prohibited and
by reason of which this order is made."
The Clayton Act provides"Sic. 3. That it shall be unlawful ;for any person engaged in commerce; in the course of such commerce, to
lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods, wares,
merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities,
whether patented or unpatented, for use, consumption
or resale within the United States or any territory thereof
or the District of Columbia or any insular possession or
other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or
fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate
upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use
or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, sup-

Opinion of the Court.

plies or other commodities of a competitor or competitors
of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease,
sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement or
understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
Respondent's written contract does not undertake to
limit the lessee's right to use or deal in the goods of a
competitor of the lessor, but leaves him free to follow his
own judgment. It is not properly described by the complaint and is not within the letter of the Clayton Act.
But counsel for the Commission insist that inasmuch as
lessees generally--except garage men in the larger
places-will not encumber themselves with more than one
equipment, the practical effect of the restrictive covenant
is to confine most dealers to the products of their lessors;
and we are asked to hold that, read in the light of these
facts, the contract falls within the condemnation of the
statute. StandardFashion Co. v. Magrane-HoustonCo.,
258 U. S. 346; and United Shoe Machinery Corporationv
United States, 258 U. S. 451, are relied upon.
In the Standard Fashion Co. Case the purchaser expressly agreed not to sell or -permit sale of any other make
of patterns on its premises. It had a retail store in Boston
and, sales elsewhere were not within contemplation of the
parties. This Court construed the contract as embodying an undertaking not to sell other patterns. In United
Shoe Machinery Corporation v. United States, when
speaking of certain "tying" restrictions, this Court
said"While the clauses enjoined do not contain specific
agreements not to use the machinery of a competitor of
the lessor, the practical effect of these drastic provisions
is to prevent such use. We can entertain no doubt that
such provisions as were enjoined are embraced in the
broad terms of the Clayton Act which cover all condi-.

474

OCTOBER TERM, 1922.
Opinion of the Court.

261 U.S.

tions, agreements or understandings of this nature. That
such restrictive and tying agreements must necessarily
lessen competition and tend to monopoly is, we believe,
equally apparent. When it is considered that the United
Company occupies a dominating position in supplying
shoe machinery of the classes involved, these covenants
signed by the lessee and binding upon him effectually
prevent him from acquiring the machinery of a competitor of the lessor except at the risk of forfeiting the
right to use the machines furnished by the United Company which may be absolutely essential to the prosecution
and success of his business. This system of 'tying' restrictions is quite as effective as express covenants could
be and practically compels the use of the machinery of
the lessor except upon risks which manufacturers will not
willingly incur."
There is no covenant in the present contract which
obligates the lessee not to sell thegoods of another; and
its language cannot be so construed. Neither the findings
,nor the evidence show circumstances similar to those surrounding the "tying" covenants of the Shoe Machinery
Company. Many competitors seek to sell excellent
brands of gasoline and no one of them is essential to the
retail business. The lessee is free to buy wherever he
chooses; he may freely accept.and use as many pumps
as he wishes and may 'discontinue any or all of them. He
may carry on business as his judgment dictates and his
means permit, save only that he cannot use the lessor's
equipment for dispensing another's brand. By investing
a comparatively small sum, he can buy an outfit and use
it without hindrance. He can have respondents gasoline,
with the pump or without the pump, and many competitors seek to supply his needs.
The cases relied upon are not controlling.
Is the challenged practice an unfair method of competition within the meaning of § 5 of the Federal Trade

Commission Act? 1 Reviewing the circumstances, four
circuit courts of appeals have answered, no. And we can
find no sufficient reason for a contrary conclusion. Certainly the practice is not opposed to. good morals because
characterized by deception, bad faith, fraud or oppression.
Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, 253 U. S. 421, 427.
It has been openly adopted by many competing concerns.
Some dealers regard it as the best practical method of preserving the integrity of their brands and securing wide
distribution. Some think it is undesirable. The devices
are not expensive-300 to $500--can be purchased
readily of makers and, while convenient, they are not
essential. The contract; open and fair upon its face, provides an unconstrained recipient with free receptacle and
pump for storing, dispensing, advertising and protecting
the lessors brand. The stuff is highly inflammable and
the method of handling it is important to the refiner. He
is also vitally interested in putting his brand within easy
reach- of consumers with ample assurance of its genuineness. No purpose or power to acquire unlawful monopoly
has been disclosed, and the record does not show that the
probable effect of the practice will be unduly to lessen
competition. Upon the contrary, it appears to have promoted the public convenience by inducing many small
dealers to enter the business and put gasoline on sale at
the
crossroads.
. The
powers of the Commission are limited by
the statutes. It has no general authority to compel competitors
to a common level, to interfere with ordinary business
methods or to prescribe arbitrary standards for those en'Sec. 5. That 'unfair methods of competitidn in commerce are

The great purpose of both statutes was to advance the
public interest by securing fair opportunity for the play
of the contending forces ordinarily engendered by an honest desire for gain. And to this end it is essential that
those who adventure their time, skill and capital should
have large freedom of action in the conduct of their own

affairs.

is sterile and requires no serious discussion.

Argued March 7, 1923.-Decided April 9, 1923.

1. The lack of power in a state court to interfere in the management of an insurance company of another State or to control the
discretion of its officers, does not deprive it of jurisdiction to render a pecuniary judgment, in an action by an insured to recover
amounts collected through assessments exceeding the maxima specified in the contract of insurance. P. 478.
So held where the company appeared and contested the jurisdiction,
upon the ground that the proceedings involved its internal affairs
and the validity of its action relative to its Safety Fund Department, over which matters the courts of its domicile had exclusive
jurisdiction, and that the enforcement of the judgment would deprive it of property without due process of law. Hartford Life
