construed by the state court. If it be construed as covering interstate commerce it is void, for the right to engage
in such commerce is not within the State's control. See
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, 125 U. S.
530, 554; Leloup v. Port of Mobile, 127 U. S. 640, 645;
Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, 155 U. S. 688, 695696. The state court may construe it as confined to
intrastate business. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v.
Arkansas, 235 U. S. 350, 368-369. In neither event would
it affect the validity of the tax before us.
We find nothing in the provisions under which the tax
was levied, in the decision of the state court, or in the
record, which gives any support to the contention that
the tax is intended to reach income from property situated
or business done without the State.

Partial Decree.

This cause having been heard and submitted.upon certain questions, and the Court having considered the same
and announced its conclusions in an opinion delivered
January 15, 1923, [260 U. S. 606]
It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed:
1. The boundary between the States of Oklahoma and
Texas, where it follows the course of the Red River from
the 100th meridian of west longitude to the eastern
boundary of the State of Oklahoma, is part of the international boundary established by the treaty df 1819 between the United States and Spain, and is on and along
the south bank of that river as the same existed in 1821,
when the treaty became effective, save as- hereinafter
stated.
2. Where intervening changes in that bank have occurred through the natural and gradual processes known
as erosion and accretion the boundary has followed the
change; but where the stream has left its former channel
and made for itself a new one through adjacent upland
by the process known as avulsion the boundary has not
followed the change, but has remained on and along what
was the south bank before the change occurred.
3. Where, since 1821, the river has cut a secondary or
additional channel through adjacent upland on the south
side in such a way that land theretofore on that side has
bcime. an island, the boundary is along- that part of the
south bank as theretofore existing which by the change
became the northerly bank of the island; and where by
accretion or erosion there have been subsequent changes
in that bank the boundary has changed with them.
4. The rules stated in the last two paragraphs will be
equally applicable to such changes as may. occur im 'th6,
future.
5. The south bank of the river is the water-washed and
.relatively permanent- elevation or acclivity, commonly
called a cut bank, along the southerly side of the river

261 U. S.

which separates its bed from the adjacent upland, whether
valley or hill, and usually serves to confine the waters
within the bed and to preserve the course of the river.
6. The boundary between the two States is on and
along that bank at the mean level attained by the waters
of the river when they reach and wash the bank without
overflowing it.
7. At exceptional places where there is no well defined
cut bank, but only a gradual incline from the sand bed
of the river to the upland, the boundary is a line over such
incline conformink to the mean level of the waters when
at other places in that vicinity they reach and wash the
cut bank without overflowing it.
8. The area known as the Big Bend, which lies within
a northerly bend of the river between a southerly extension of the east line of range thirteen west in Oklahoma
and a southerly extension of the west line of range fourteen west in that State, has been since before 1821 fast
upland on the southerly side of the river, is within the
State of Texas and never was owned by the United States.
The northerly border of that area is part of the south
bank of the river on and along which the state boundary
extends.
9. Burke Bet Island and Goat Island, both of which
are in the vicinity of the Big Bend Area, are islands in
the river, have been islands since before 1821, are within
the State of Oklahoma, and are the property of the
United States.
10. The island in front of the line between Hardeman
and Wilbarger Counties, in the State of Texas, was part
of the fast valley land on the south side of the river in
1821, and was severed from the land on that side by
avulsion in 1902. The island is within the State of Texas
and the state boundary is along its northerly bank.
11. The treaty of 1819 secures to the inhabitants of
the State of Texas a right of reasonable access to the

waters of the river along the state boundary, such as will
enable them to reach the waters at all stages and to use
the same for beneficial purposes in common with the
inhabitants of the State of Oklahoma and of other parts
of the United States.
12. The two States and the United States having joined
in a request that they be permitted to withdraw the prayer
in their pleadings that the boundary for its full length
along the river be run, located and marked upon the
ground, and having also joined in a further request that
the boundary be run, located and marked only at the
places hereinafter named, the requests are granted, and
Arthur D. Kidder and Arthur A. Stiles, both cadastral
engineers, are designated as commissioners torun, locate
and mark upon the ground the following portions of the
boundary in accordance with this decree and the principles
announced in the opinion delivered January 15, 1923:
(a) Along the Big Bend Area*as hereinbefore defined;
(b) From the Big Bend Area westward to a southerly
extension of the west line of range sixteen west in Oklahoma;
(c) Along all places where by avulsion since .1821 the
river has come to occupy a new channel whereby fast
upland theretofore on one side of the river has come to
be on the other side,-the, line in every such instance to
be run, located and marked on and along what was the
south bank before the change occurred; and
(d) Along any other places which either State or the
United States may designate in a request in writing approved by a member of this court.
13. The mode of marking those portions of the boundary shall be by establishing in the vicinity thereof permanent monuments upon the fast upland on the southerly
side of the river at suitable distances apart and carefully
taking the distances and courses from such monuments.

is done.. A description of the monuments and a statement
of such distances and courses shall be included in the
report of the commissioners:
14. Before they enter upon their work each commissioner shall take and subscribe an oath to perform his

the work with all convenient dispatch, shall have, authority to employ such assistants as may be needed therein,
and shall include in their final report a statement of the
work done and of the time employed and the expenses
incurred in its performance.
15. The boundary along the Big Bend Area as hereinbefore defined shall be run, located, monumented and reported to the court before the commissioners take up
other portions of the work. In running and locating that
part of the boundary the -ommissioners shall ascertain
the exact location of all oil wells which are within three
hundred feet of the same -and shall include a statement
thereof in their report.
16. The work of the commissioners shall be subject in
all its parts to-the approval of the court. Copies of their
reports shall be promptly delivered to the two States and

the United States, and exceptions or objections thereto,
if there be such, shall be presented to the court, or, if it
be not in session, filed with the Clerk, within forty days
after the report is made.
17. If for any reason there be a vacancy in the commission when th6 court is not in session the same may be
filled by the designation of a new commissioner by the
Chief Justice.
18. The cost -of executing this decree, including the
compensation of the commissioners, shall be borne in
equal parts by the State of Oklahoma, the State of Texas
and the United States.

MARCH 12, 1923.

Supplemental decree relating to certain lands in the, bed of Red River
and bordering its north side; declaring principles determining
ownership and riparian rights and specifying the limits of particular titles; and directing the receiver to surrender possession of
all patented and allotted tracts on the northerly side of the medial
line of the river, within the receivership area and having no oil
wells, such surrender to discharge them from the receivership.

On consideration of the several stipulations, suggestions and supporting briefs relating to the entry of a further decree to supplement the partial decree entered June
5, 1922, under the opinion delivered May 1, 1922, [258
U. S. 574]
It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed:
1. This supplemental decree relates only to the bed of
the Red River, and to lands bordering on the north side
of the same, between the 98th meridian of west longitude
and the mouth of the North Fork.
2. The several interveners who, under patents or Indian allotments by the United States, own lands bordering
on the north side of the river are severally the owners of
so much of the bed of the river as lies in front of their
lands and north of the medial line of the riveT, except as
is otherwise stated herein.
3. Where, under grants from the United States, the
State of Oklahoma owns lands bordering on the north
side of the river the State has the same riparian rights in

the river bed that an individual owning the same lands
under a patent or Indian allotment would have.
4. The full title and ownership of so much of the bed
of the river as lies south of its medial line are in the
United States.
5. In the sense intended herein, the medial line of the
river is a line drawn midway between the northerly and
southerly banks of the river, commonly called cut banks,
savethat, under a stipulation between the parties affected,
to which full effect must be given, this line, in so far as it
reaches and is in contact with patented or allotted tracts
which are within what is now the bed of the river, shall
be regarded and treated as fallig no farther north than
the southerly line of such tracts as the same were represented by the official survey according to which they were
patented or allotted.
6. Where tracts on the north side of the river, which
were not riparian when surveyed, were patented or allotted after they had become riparian, such disposals
carried the title to the medial line of the river, unless
other tracts between them and that line had been disposed of theretofore, in which event the later disposals
did not carry any right in, or affect the title to, such
intervening tracts.
7. Where tracts on the north side, which had come to
be in the river bed after survey and before disposal, were
patented or allotted as if they were upland, while the adjacent land behind them which was then actually riparian
was as yet unsold and unallotted, such disposals carried
the title to the medial line of the river, unless other tracts
between them and that line had been disposed of there-"
tofore, in which event the later disposals did not carry
any right in, or affect the title to, such intervening tracts.
8. The patenting and allotting .of lands 'bordering on
the north side of the river did not carry or give any right
to islands in the river which were in existence at that
time
