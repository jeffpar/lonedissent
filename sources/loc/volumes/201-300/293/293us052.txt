The authority of the Congress to enact legislation of
this nature was not limited by previous decisions as to the
extent of the admiralty jurisdiction. We have had abundant reason to realize that our experience and new conditions give rise to new conceptions of maritime concerns.
These may require that former criteria of jurisdiction be
abandoned, as, for example, they were abandoned in discarding the doctrine that the admiralty jurisdiction was
limited to tidewaters. The Genesee Chief, 12 How. 443,

The constitutional validity of the grant of jurisdiction

that a federal question was -necessarily decided in determining the
cause; and if it be uncertain whether the judgment was based upon
a federal ground, or upon a non-federal ground sufficient to sustain
it, this Court will not take jurisdiction. P. 54.

CERTIORARI, 292 U. S. 616, to review a judgment (263
N. Y. 533; 189 N. E. 684) affirming, without opinion, a
judgment of the-Appellate Division (237 App. Div. 763;
263 N. Y. S. 259) annulling a tax assessment.

Mr. Joseph M. Mesnig, Assistant Attorney General of
New York, with whom Mr. John J. Bennett, Jr., Attorney General, and Mr. Henry, Epstein, Solicitor General,

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE- HUGHES delivered the opinion of
the Court.
The State Tax Commission determined that rental received by the relator, a resident of :the State of New York,
from real property situated in the State of Ohio, should
be included as a part of relator's income for the purpose
of computing her income tax under the Tax Law of New
York. The relator sought review by the Supreme Court
of New York, invoking rights under the Constitution and
laws of the State of New-York and under the Fourteenth

293 U. S.

Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Department., annulled the determination of the State Tax
Commission. 237 App. Div. 763; 263 N. Y. S. 259. That
court, while citing decisions of this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment, did not state that its decision rested
upon the application of the Constitution of the United
States. The Court of Appeals of the State affirmed the
order of the Appellate Division, but without opinion, 263
N. Y. 533; 189 N. E. 684, and the grounds of its decision
are left to conjecture. It may be surmised, from the
quotations in its opinion, that the Appellate Division intended to rest its decision upon a determination of the
application of the Fourteenth fAmendment, and that the
affirmance by the Court of Appeals went upon the same
ground, and not upon the non-federal ground of the application of the Constitution and laws of the State. But
jurisdiction cannot be founded upon surmise. Nor can
claim of jurisdiction be sustained by reference to briefs
and statements which are not part of the record.
It is essential to the jurisdiction of this Court in reviewing a decision of a court of a State that it must
appear affirmatively- from the record, not only that a
federal question was presented for decision to the highest
court of the State having jurisdiction but that its decision
of the federal question was necessary to the determination
of the cause, and that it was actually decided or that the
judgment as rendered could not have been given without
deciding it. De Saussure v. Gaillard, 127 U. S. 216, 234;
Johnson v. Risk, 137 U. S. 300, 306, 307; Wood Mowing
& Reaping Machine Co. v. Skinner, 139 U. S. 293, 2951
297; Eustis v. Bolles, 150 U. S. 361, 366, 367; Whitney v'.
California, 274 U. S. 357, 360, 361; Mellon v. O'Neil, 275
U. S. 212, 214. Where the judgment of the state court
rests on two grounds, one involving a federal question
and the other not, or if it does not appear upon which of

two grounds the judgment was based, and the ground
independent of a federal questiop is sufficient in itself to
sustain it, this Court will not take jurisdiction. Allen v.
Arguimbau, 198 U. S. 149, 154, 155; Johnson v. Risk,
supra; Wood Mowing & Reaping Machine Co. v. Skinner,
supra; Consolidated Turnpike Co. v. Norfolk & Ocean
View Ry. Co., 228 U. S. 596, 590; Cuyahoga River Power
Co. v. Northern Realty Co., 244 U. S. 300, 302, 304.
Petitioners have made no effort to obtain an amendment by the Court of Appeals of its remittitur, and
although, on the oral argument in this Court,. attention
was directed to the practice in New York to entertain, in
proper :cases, an application for such an amendment in
order to show appropriately the basis of the determination
of the state court, no request was made for a continuance
to permit such an application.
As the record fails to show jurisdiction in this Court,
the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently
granted.
Dismissed.
