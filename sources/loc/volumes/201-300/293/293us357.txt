& Company had outstanding only $60,000 of capital stock,
90 per cent. of which was acquired by respondent for less
than par. During the affiliated period, its deductible
losses amounted to more than three times its capital.
While it is conceivable that, as suggested by respondent,
the losses do not necelssarily indicate that thereby Thane
& Company became unable to pay its debts, the circumstances tend strongly to indicate that they did cause its
breakdown, resulting in respondent's 1923 losses here
claimed. If these losses did -not cause, or are not reflected
in, those sustained by respondent in 1.923 as the result
of its investment in and advances to that company, it
reasonably may be presumed that respbndent would have
shown that fact.

on the ground that the federal courts were not bound by
a state court's construction of its own uniform laws.
The bearer bonds are negotiable instruments under arid
governed by the Negotiable Instruments Law in force in
Wisconsin at the time of their execution and delivery.
Their negotiable character is not destroyed by the reference to the trust deed securing their payment; for the reference is solely to the security and to the rights of the
bondholders in and to such security.
Petitioners, as pledgees, took in good faith and are holders in due course under the Wisconsin Negotiable Instruments Law. Under that law, bad faith alone and not constructive notice will defeat the rights of the holder of a
negotiable instrument. Neither the reference to the trust
deed nor the fact that the pledgor was named trustee of
the security was notice to petitioners that the pledgor held
the bonds themselves in a fiduciary capacity;- The burden
of proof was upon respondents to establish bad faith on
the part of petitioners in taking the bonds.
Mr. Irving A. Fish for respondents.
The language on the face of the bonds and the nature
of the pledge gave the bank actual notice of the breach
of trust. Schroeder v. Arcade Theater Co., 175 Wis. 79,

The question of notice has not been passed on by the
Wisconsin 'court. This point was not actually decided
in the Pollard case.
The Supreme Court of Wisconsin is not bound by
decisions where a point might have-defeated the action

-The Circuit Court of Appeals has discussed and severely criticized the opinion in the Pollard case on the
question of the negotiability of the instruments in question. The conclusion arrived at by the Wisconsin court
does seem strange, but we are not concerned with the.
question of negotiability. The trust deed contained, the
power in the trustees to sell the bonds and apply their
proceeds to the redemption of the outstanding mortgage.
If the bank had bought these bonds from these trustees
in good faith, whether they are negotiable or not, :they are good in the hands of the bank. It seems, however,
that the pledge of the bonds for the personal obliga.tion
of the trustee, contrary to the terms of the trUst, precludes the idea of good faith on the part of the bank.

MARINE BANK v. KALT-ZIMMERS CO. 361
357

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.
In bankruptcy proceedings pending in Wisconsin, the
petitioners, two Milwaukee banks, prayed an order of the
court for permission to sell collateral securities pledged
by the bankrupt. The subject of the pledge was bonds
payable to bearer, secured by a deed of trust. The' District Court refused the relief (6 F. Supp. 638), and the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. 70 F.
(2d) 815. Two questions are in the case, first, whether
the bonds are negotiable in form, and, second, whether the
petitioners are holders in good faith. We granted
certiorari.
On October 9, 1929, Kalt-Zimmers Manufacturing
Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, made its deed of trust
to Hackett, Hoff and Thiermann, Incorporated, trustee, to
secure bonds of the total amount of $115,000., The bonds
are payable to bearer. They are stated to- be secured by
a deed of trust to the above named trustee, " to which
deed of trust reference is hereby made with the same effect
as though recited at length herein, for the description of
the property mortgaged, the nature and extent of the
security, the rights of the holders of the bonds, and the
terms and conditions upon which the said bonds are issued, held and secured, and may, before their fixed maturities, be declared at once due and payable, and the
manner of prepayment before maturity." They are to
pass by delivery, but they are not to be valid for any purpose or be secured by the deed of trust until certified by
the trustee to be bonds covered by the mortgage.
The deed of trust thus referred to states the duty of the
trustee in thedisposition of the bonds and the application
of the proceeds. The directions are precise and full. As
soon as practicable after certifying the bonds the trustee is
to negotiate and sell them. The proceeds are to be used,
first, for the discharge of an underlying mortgage of
$35,000 on real estate in Milwuakee belonging to the mort-

gagor; second, to pay the cost f a building then about to
be constructed; "the balance," if any, "to be at the
disposal of the party of the first part," the mak4 of the
deed. "The trustee, or any of its officers, agents or stockholders may acquire, own and deal in said bonds and coupon's with the sans rights as if not trustee hereunder and
shall not be obliged to, account to any one for any profits
made thereby."
Hackett, Hoff and Thiermann, the trustee, did not dispose of the bonds in controversy in accordance with the
deed of trust. Instead it pledged them with the petitioners
($6000 of bonds with the Marine Bank and $8,500 with
the West Side Bank) as security for its own indebtedness,
receiving back in some instances additional loans and in
other instances securities of equal value previously
pledged. On June 8, 1931, the trustee was adjudicated.a
bankrupt, whereupon the banks petitioned for authority
to sell the bonds in their possession. The courts below
have ruled that upon the face of the bonds the bankrupt
held them not in its own right, but as trustee for the mortgagor or others, and that by reason of this disclosure the
pledgees had been put upon inquiry and were chargeable
with constructive notice of the provisions of the trust.
All the transactions took place in Wisconsin, where the
law of negotiable instruments is governed by statute.
Wisconsin Statutes, 1929, § 116.01 et seq.
First: Under the Wisconsifi statute, as construed by the
highest
court of that state, the bonds are negotiable.
Section
116.02 Wisconsin Statutes, 1929, provides
as
follows:
"An instrument tt be negotiable must conform to the
following requirements:
(1) It must be in writing and signed by the maker or
drawer.
(2) Must contain an unconditional promise or order to
pay a sum certain in money.

MARINE BANK v. KALT-ZIMMERS CO.
357

363

Opinion of the Court.

(3) Must be payable on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time.
(4) Must be payable to order or to bearer.
(5) Where the instrument is addressed to a drawee, he
must be named or otherwise indicated therein with
reasonable certainty." 1
The bonds in controversy are payable to bearer. They
are obviously negotiable, unless the reference, already
quoted, to the terms of the deed of trust makes the promise
of payment conditional. An identical provision was
considered by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in Pollard
v. Tobin, 211 Wis. 405; 247 N. W. 453. The ruling of
the court was that negotiability was not impaired. Cf.
Enoch v. Brandon, 249 N. Y. 263; 164 N. E: 45; Siebenhauer v. Bank of California,211 Cal. 239; 294 Pac. 1062;
Pflueger v. Broadway Trust & Savings Bank, 351 Ill. 170;
184 N. E. 318; Paepcke v. Paine,253 Mich. 636; 235 N. W.
871; Merchants National Bank v. Detroit Trust o., 258
Mich. 526; 242 N. W. 739; Bank of Californiav. National
City Co., 138 Wash. 517; 244 Pac. 690. This construction
of a Wisconsin statute is binding upon the national courts,
though the statute may have been intended to be declaratory of the rule at common law. Burns Mortgage Co. v.
Friqd, 292 U. S. 487.
Second: The bonds being negotiable, the petitioners
under the Wisconsin law have the privileges accorded
to holders in good faith.
Section' 116.61; Wisconsin Statutes, 1929, provides as
follows:
"Actual knowledge of infirmity necessary to notice. To,
constitute notice of an infirmity in the instrument or
defect in the title of the person negotiating the same, the
person to whom it is negotiated must have had actual

Opinioti of the Court.

293 U. S.

knowledge of the infirmity oi. defect, or knowledge of
such facts that his actio n in taking the instrument
amounted to bad faith."
The effect of this section was considered in. Pollard v.
Tobin, supra. There the same bankrupt, Hackett, Hoff
and- Thiermann, Incorporated, was truste6 under another
deed of trust, made by one Tobin. The bonds had the
same provisions contained in the bonds in suit. There,
as here, the bankrupt pledged the bonds with a bank as
security for loans. The court held that the bank was a
holder in due course. It was a holder for value, for it
had given up other collateral upon the pledge of the new
security (citing American Savings Bank & Trust Co. V.
Helgesen, 64 Wash. 54; 116 Pac. 837). It was a holder
in good faith, for there was "no evidence of actual
knowledge on the part of the bank of any infirmity in the
bonds or any defect in the Hackett Corporation's title to
them" (citing § 116.61, Negotiable Instruments Law of
Wisconsin).
We interpret that decision as a ruling that under the
Wisconsin statute notice of facts tending to put a cautious
buyer upon inquiry will not defeat the title of a holder
of negotiable paper, if in truth there was neither actual
knowledge of an infirmity nor conscious joinder in a fraud.
Cf. Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110, 121; Swift v. Smith,
102 U..S. 442, 444; Crittenden v. Widrevitz, 272 Fed. 871,
873; Cheever v. Pittsburgh,S. & L. E. R. Co., 150 N. Y.
59, 65, 66; 44 N. E. 701; Nickey Bros. v. Lonsdale Mfg.
Co., 149 Tenn. 1; 257 S. W. 403. As applied to the case
at hand, the reasoning, it seems, is this: A trustee under a
mortgage may or may not be a trustee of bonds payable
to bearer, accompanying the mortgage. The existence of
the one trust does not lead as a necessary inference to the
' The cases are assembled in Brannon's Negotiable Instruments Law,

Opinion of the Court.

existence of the other. If title or possession as .a fiduciary
is not apparent from the bonds themselves or is not otherwise made known, there is no duty resting upon the buyer
to examine the deed of trust, or explore other avenues Qf
inquiry, to discover the concealed relation. We are not
required for present purposes to approve this doctrine or
disapprove it. Enough that we accept it as the law of the
Wisconsin court. Whether the same result will follow if a
pledgee, making a loan upon bonds for the private use o
the pledgor, is aware that a trust has been attached to
what is taken as security, we do not now consider. There
are decisions at common law that acceptance of a pledge
upon such terms amounts to bad faith or to evidence thereof, or even to actual knowledge of an infirmity of title.
Cf. Duncan v. Jaudon, 15 Wall. 165; Manhattan Bank v.
Walker, 130 U. S. 267, 278; Smith v. Ayer, 101 U. S. 320,
328; Ward v. City Trust Co., 192 N. Y. 61, 69, 70; 84 N. E.
585; Newburyport v. Fidelity Mutual Life Ins. Co., 197
Mass. 596; 84 N. E. 111; Empire Trust Co. v. Cahan, 274
U. S. 473.1 We do not understand that any ruling yet
made as to the effect of the Wisconsin statute extends to
such a state of facts. Pollard v. Tobin, as we read it, is
authority for this: that a bond payable to bearer is not
sullied upon its face because tendered by a holder who is
known to be a trustee under the mortgage and to have
certified the issue. From that knowledge without more,
a buyer in Wisconsin is not chargeable with actual notice
that the title of the seller is subject to a trust, or with a
fraudulent participation in the abuse of-a trust relation.
What we have written as to the meaning of Pollardv.
Tobin is not at variance with the construction given to
that judgment in the opinion of the court below. Referring to the Wisconsin case, the Court of Appeals said
'The cases are brought together 'in Scott, Participation in a Breach
of Trust, 34 Harv. L. Rev. 454, 457 et seq.

293 U. S.

thatit " involved the identical question now under consideration, arising out of a transaction between the same
bankrupt and another bank, in which there were pledged,
under similar circumstances, bonds practically identical in
form and terms with the bonds herein involved." 70 F.
(2d:) ai 817. 'With this concession there was none the less
a refusal to follow the Wisconsin rule, thecourt expressing
the opinion that the rule had its origin in the misconstruction of a declaratory statute. "The federal courts are not
bound," it was said, "by a decision of a state court in the
interpretation or application of a provision of a uniform
law contrary to the weight of authority as established by
decisions of other states." 70 F. (2d) at 818. By our
judgment in Burns Mortgage Co. v;.Fried, supra, a case
decided shortly after the decision of this case below, the
law is settled to the contrary.
The p6int is made for the respondent that adherence is
not owing to Pollard v. Tobin; for the reason that at-the
date of the transactions in controversy the meaning of the
Wisconsin statute was still undetermined. Kuhn v. Fairmont Coal Co., 215 U. S. 349, is cited in support of that
contention. What was involved in that case was the
application of a local decision affecting interests in real
estate that were untouched by any statute.. The opinion
of thd-court.(p. 369) does not deny (citing Brine v. Insurance Co., 96 U. S. 627, 636), that the conclusion would
have been different if the contested interests had been
dependent upon a statute preceding their creation, though
not construed till afterwards. In that event the later construction would have been read into the act as if there'from
the beginning. Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Risty,
276 U. S. 567, 570; Sioux County v. National Surety Co.,

Statement of the Case.

357

The Negotiable Instruments Law of Wisconsin was part
of the law of that state. when the bonds in controversy
were pledged. This being so, the decision in Pollard v.
To]bin supplies the governing rule irrespective of the date
when the decision was announced. In that view, Kuhn v.
Fairmont Coal Co. is seen to be irrelevant. there is no
occasion in such circumstances to mark its limits more
precisely. Hawks v. Hamill, supra.
