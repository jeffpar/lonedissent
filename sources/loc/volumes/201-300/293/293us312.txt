CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 170. Argued November 15, 16, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934.
1. The legislative history of § 204 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of
1926 shows that this section does not grant a deduction for depletion but merely provides methods for computing the amount of the
deduction granted by § 234 (a) (8) of the Act. Pp. 315, 319.
2. The deduction for depletion in the case of a lease of oil and gas
wells must be apportioned between the lessor and lessee as provided
by § 234 (a) (8), irrespective of which of the methods prescribed
by § 204 for computing the amount of the deduction is chosen.

Opinion of the Court.

The last clause of § 204 (c) (2) providing that ".
in no case
shall the depletion allowance be less than it would be if computed
without reference to this paragraph," does not require a different
result. P. 319.
3. Under § 204 (c) (2) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which provides
that " In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion
shall be 271/! per centum of the gross income from the property
during the taxable year," the basis for computing the allowance in
the case of a taxpafyer operating under a lease requiring the payment of royalties, is the gross income from production less the
amounts which the taxpayer was obligated to pay as royalties,
whether the royalties were paid in kind, or their value in cash.
Pp. 320-321.
4. The provision of § 114 (b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1932, which
expressly excludes from the basis for computing the percentage
depletion for oil and gas wells "any rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property," was merely

and its apportionment between lessor and lessee where
the income is derived from operation under an oil and
gas lease.
During 1925, 1926 and 1927 the respondent, as assignee of the lessee named in an oil and gas lease, extracted substantial quantities of oil. By the terms of
the lease and the assignment it was obligated to pay royalties in cash or in kind, totalling one-quarter of the oil
extracted. The respondent claimed, that the gross proceeds of all the 'il produced should form the basis for
the computation of the allowance for depletion granted
by § 204 (c) (2), but the-petitioner ruled that the deduction should be limited to 271/ per cent. of gross production less royalties paid. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the ruling.2 The Circuit Court of Alpeals reversed the Board.' The case is here on writ of certiorari.4
The petitioner construes § 204 (c) (2) in pari materia
with § 234 (a) (8), and asserts the percentage deduction
permitted by the former is subject to the requirement of
equitable apportionment between the lessor and lessee

required by the latter. The respondent urges that § 204
(c) (2) is an independent and complete provision, to be
applied without reference to § 234 (a) (8). and that to
attempt to apportion the allowance granted by § 204 (c)
(2) in the manner indicated by § 234 (a) (8) would violate the plain terms of the statute.
Reference to the structure of the successive income tax
laws will aid in a solution of the problem. The Revenue
Act of 1916' imposed an income tax by Title I... It divided the provisions as to tax into two parts, Part I on
individuals, and Part II on corporations. In each part

the statute first lays the tax and in a subsequent section
grants certain deductions, those enumerated in § 5 of Part
I being available to individuals, and those specified in
§ 12 of Part II to corporations. Both sections include a
reasonable allowance for depletion in the case of oil and
gas wells. In the drafting of the Revenue Act of 1918 6
a new arrangement of the subject matter was adopted.
Title I is composed of definitions, Title II treats of income tax. Part I of this title consists of general provisions applicable alike to individual and corporate taxpayers. Sections under this part define taxable years
and dividends, and § 202 prescribes the "basis for determining gain or loss," but makes no reference to depletion
of mines, timber, or oil and gas wells. Additional sections have to do with inventories, net losses, and other
general. matters. Part II levies the tax on individuals,
defines net and gross income, and in § 214 specifies the
deductions allowed from gross income. The opening
sentence of subsectioti (a) (10) is:
"In the case of mines, oil and gas wells,. other natural
deposits, and timber, a reasonable allowance for depletion
and for depreciation of improvements, according to the
peculiar conditions in each case, based upon cost including cost of development not otherwise deducted."
Then follow two provisos, one directing how cost shall
be ascertained in the case of properties acquired prior to
MIVarch 1, 1913, and the other allowing an alternative
dismethod of calculating depletion upon the basis ofparawells. The

Opinion of the Court.

In Part III, levying the corporation tax, § 234 (a) (9)
allows a deduction for depletion in the identical phraseology employed with respect to individual taxpayers in
s 214 (a)(10).
The same method was followed in the Revenue Act of
1921.' The general provisions contain no reference to depletion, but under Parts II apd III of Title II -the tax is
fixed for individuals aid corporations and the allowable
'deductions from gross income are set forth. The paragraphs of the prior Act as to depletion of oil and gas wells
are literally retnacted, but there is inserted in § 214 (a)
(10) as to individuals and § 234 (a) (9) as to corporations, an additional proviso with respect to discovery
value.
In the framing of the Revenue Act of 1924 "the same
arrangement was observed. General definitions are found
in Title I; Title II treats of income tax, and in Part I of
that title are included general provisions applicable to
both individual and corporate taxes. Amongst such general provisions in the earlier acts there had been a section
entitled "Basis for determining gain or loss." In the
1924 Act the draftsman embodied paragraphs similar to
those of the earlier act in § 204, but enlarged the caption
to read "Basis for determining gain or loss, depletion, and
depreciation,"and transferred to this section that portion
of the depletion provision dealing with the basis of the
allowance which had formerly appeared under the heading " Deductions" in Part II, Individuals, and Part III,
Corporations. This added to the old § 204 a new subsection (c), which permits the use of cost or discovery
value as the basis of depletion in the case of mines and
oil and gas wells. Having transferred these provisions
from §§ 214 (a) (9) and 234 (a) (8), respecting individual

and corporate deductions, there* remained in those sections the language first found in the Act of 1918, above
quoted, including the concluding sentence relating to
equitable apportionment between lessor and lessee. The
thought apparently was that the authority for the deduction should remain in the sections dealing with all deductions and the formulae for calculating the deduction
should be relegated to a general provision applicable alike
to corporations and individuals.
The depletion allowance based on discovery value was
found difficult of administration, since it required a
separate valuation of each well,' and was abandoned in
the Revenue Act of 1926.10 There was substituted a flat
allowance of 271/ per cent. of gross income. In this Act
the same arrangement was followed as in that of 1924.
Under Title II, Income Tax, Part I was devoted to eneral provisions. As the basis for determining gain or loss,
depletion and depreciation, had been embodied in § 204
of the general provisions of the Act of 1924, in which was
the permitted use of discovery value as a basis for depletion, when that method was discarded in favor of the flat
percentage of gross income it was logical to insert the,
substituted paragraph in the place where the discarded *
one had been. Thus we find the new formula inserted as
paragraph (c) (2) of § 204. The authority for deduction
of depletion remains where it has always been since the
Act of 1918, namely, in § 214 (a) (9) of Part II, Individuals, and § 234 (a) (8) of Part III, Corporations, and
naturally there still remains in these paragraphs the
limitation -that the allowance shall be apportioned'
between lessor and lessee.'"

"In framing the Revenue Act of 1928 (45 Stat. 791) the draftsman
reverted to an arrangement similar to that found in the Revenue Act
of 1916. Thus under Title I an income tax is laid on both individuals
and corporations, and in subsequent portions of the Act general pro10

Opinion of the Court.

This outline of the framework of the legislation demonstrates that Congress did not insert § 204 (c) (2) as an
independent section granting an allowance or deduction
for depletion. In the earlier Acts both the grant and the
method of computation were embraced in a subsection under the title " Deductions." In the later Acts of 1924
and 1926 the grant remained in the deduction section
and the taxpayer was referred to a general provision in
§ 204 for the method of ascertaining its amount.
Respondent emphasizes the last clause of § 204 (c) (2),
which is: "except that in no case shall the depletion
allowance be less than it would be if computed without
reference to this paragraph." It is argued that as this
exception gives the taxpayer an option to compute the
allowance either on the cost basis or by the flat percentage method, if he elects the former he proceeds under
234 (a) (8). Thus it is said that section applies only in
case the' cost basis is chosen. But an examination of the
statute demonstrates the error of this position. No basis
or formula for computation of the allowance is found in
§ 34; on the contrary all permissible procedures are covered by § 204, whether cost depletion of ,mines. and oil
visions are contained. In this Act tho deductions from gross income
are found in § 23 under Part II, ' Computation of Net Income," and
the language of § 214 (a) (9) and § 234 (a) (10) of the Revenue Act
of 1926 is found only in this section, applicable to both sorts of taxpayers, corporate and individual, as subsection (1). A new subsection
(m) is added, which states: " The basis upon which depletion, exhaustion, wear and rear, and obsolescence are to be allowed in respect'
of any property shall be as provided in section 1.14." Section 114 is
found in SupPlement B,and so far as material here is the same with
res )ect to gas :ind oil wells as the analogous portions of § 204 (c) of
the Act of 1926
It is quite clear, therefore, from this cross-reference, that the
framers of the Act understood the deduction was allowed by § 23 (1)
but the method of calculating it was to be ascertained by reference to
a general provision on that subject, § 114.

wells, paragraph (c); discovery value basis in the case
of mines (c) (1); or flat percentage of gross income in
the case of oil and gas wells (c) (2). If, therefore, the
taxpayer does not compute under (c) (2) he must do so
in accordance with the cost method prescribed by the
earlier paragraph (c) of the same section, and not, as contended, under 234 (a) (8).
It follows that whichever method outlined in § 204 is
chosen for computing the allowance granted by § 234,
the deduction must be apportioned between lessor and
lessee.
We come, then, to consider the propriety of the procedure followed by the Commissioner. What he did, in
effect, was to treat the gross production less royalties as
the measure of the respondent's depletable interest in the
property, and the royalties as the measure of the depletable interest of those entitled to receive them. The respondent says, however, that under § 213 the gross production of the wells is respondent's gross income from the
property, must be reported as such, and § 204 (c) (2)
permits him an allowance of 271/2 per cent. thereof. It
must follow that the royalties (one-fourth of the same
gross production) are gross income to those receiving
them and are subject to depletion at the rate of 271/2 per
cent. The result would be a total allowance of 27'/2 per
cent. of five-fourths of the total production. Certainly
this would 'not be a single allowance, apportioned between
lessor and lessee. And we think § 204 (c) (2) does not
require such a result. The words used are, " the allowance for depletion shall be 271/2 per centum of the gross
income from the property during the taxable year." Is
the italicized phrase synonymous with the taxpayer's
gross income as defined in § 213? It cannot be if "property" signifies the tract of land in all its uses, others as
well as the extraction of oil and gas. Darby-Lynde Co. v.

Opinion of the Court.

Alexander, 51 F. (2d) 56. The phrase, we think, points
only to the gross income from oil and gas. Compare
United States v. Dakota-Montana Oil Co., 288 U. S. 459,
461; Greensboro Gas Co. v. Commissioner, 30 B. T. A.
1361. So restricted, it presents no difficulty where the
owner of the land is also the operator, and there is none
where the lessee turns over royalty oil in kind to the
lessor, for the retained oil, in that ease, is the base for the
lessee's computation of depletion and the royalty oil that
for the lessor's. We think Congress did not interd a different result where, as here, the lessee sells all the oil and
pays over the royalty in the form of cash.
At all events, as the section must be read in the light
of the requirement of apportionment of a single depletion
allowance, we are unable to say that the Commissioner
erred in holding that for the purpose of computation
"gross income from the property " meant gross income
from production less the amounts which the taxpayer was
obliged to pay as royalties. The apportionment gives respondent 271/2 per cent. of the gross income from production which it had the right to retain and the assignor and
lessor respectively 271/2 per cent. of the royalties they
receive. Such an apportionment has regard to the economic interest of each of the parties entitled to participate in the depletion allowance. Compare Palmer v.
Bender, 287 U. S. 551. 558.
The respondent insists that, so applied, the section may
work unjust and unequal results; but it is to be remarked
that this is likely to be so wherever a rule of thumb is applied without a detailed examination of the facts affecting
each taxpayer. No doubt, as the petitioner points out,
equally illogical results might ensue from the application
of the section as the respondent construes it. And it is
also to be remembered that depletion upon cost or Ma.ch
1, 1913 value is optional with the taxpayer, if that
proc6dure is more fav6rable to him.

293 U. S.

Finally, the respondent says that in the Revenue Act of
1932 ' the section corresponding to 204 (c) (2) was
amended so as to authorize such a procedure as the petitioner adopted in this case, and therefore the section as it
stood in the Act of 1926 could not have supported the
Commissioner's ruling. The amendment alters the section to read: " " In the case of oil and gas wells the allowance for depletion shall be 271/2 per centum of the gross
income from the property during the taxable year, excluding from such gross income an amount equal to any
rents or royalties paid or incurred by the taxpayer in respect of the property. . . ." The petitioner says that the
amendment was merely clarifying in purpose and declaratory of the existing law as administered. We think this is
so. When it was offered the chairman of the committee
having the bill in charge so stated," and the conference
report is to the same effect."
