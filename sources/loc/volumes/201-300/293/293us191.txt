HELVERING v. NORTHERN COAL CO.
190

Syllabus.

"Question 2. If question 1 should be answered in the
negative, should the order of this court be a dismissal
without prejudice?"
Where an appellant fails to file assignments of error as
required by the applicable rule (28 U. S. C. 862, 880; Rule
No. 11 of the Rules of the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit), the appeal may be dismissed. Compare Rules of this Court No. 9 and No. 27, pars. 4, 5. But
where an appeal is properly before the Court and, upon
hearing the appeal, the Court determines that such' assignments of error as have been duly filed have been abandoned, the Court may affirm the decree from which the
appeal is taken.
Question No. 1 is answered in the affirmative.

OCTOBER. TERM. 1934.
Argument for Petitioner.

293 U. S

These cases came up by certiorari, 289 U. S. 718, 719.
720 to review judgments sustaining decisions of the
Board of Tax Appeals overruling deficiency assessments
of income and profits taxes. 24 B. T. A. 307, 62 F. (2d)
742; 23 B. T. A. 872,64 F. (2d) 69; 24 B. T. A. 1346, 62 F.
(2d) 518. The judgments below were affirmed by an
equally divided Court October 23, 1933, 290 U. S. 591.
Petitions for rehearing in three of them were denied in
November, 1933, and the mandates in all four were issued
in that month. On May 21, 1934, the Term not having
ended, the Government asked leave to file the present
petition. By order of May 28, 1934, the petition was
entertained and attention was directed to § 1005 of the
Revenue Act of 1926. 292 U. S. 612.
Mr. Justin Miller, with whom Solicitor General Biggs
and Mr. Erwin N. Griswold were on the brief, for
petitioner.
. The Government advanced as ground for rehearing that
on March 5, 1934, in Helvering v. Newport Co., 291 U. S.
485, the Court had decided in the Government's favor the
precise question presented by the cases sought to be
reargued, viz., that tax assessment waivers, executed after
the statutory period for assessment had expired and while
the Revenue Act of 1926 was in effect, were valid. And it
contended that, apart from the provisions of § 1005 of
that Act,. there could be no question of the power of this
Court to set aside or modify its judgments upon application made at the Term in which they were entered. Tbis
is an inherent power vested in the Court by the Constitution. Congress can not eliminate such essential Judicial
characteristics of federal courts, even of those created by
its own Acts; and its Acts should not be construed as so
intending. See United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 31, 34;
Gordon v. United States, 117 U. S. 697, 701-702,- 704;
In re, Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594; Kansas v; Colorado, 206
U. S. 46, 82; United States v..Evans, 213 U. S. 297;

Per Curiam.

United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128, 146-147; Ross v.
United States, 8 App. D. C. 32, 37, 40; Stephens v.
Cherokee Nation, 174 U.S. 445, 478; Muskrat v.. United
States, 219 U.S. 346, 362; Keller v. Potomac Electric
Power Co., 261 U.S. 428, 444; Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103
U.S. 168, 190-191.
But, properly interpreted, neither the purpose nor the
effect of § 1005 was to limit this Court in its control of its
own judgments during the Term.
Mr. Paul F. Myers, with whom Mr. Edmund B. Quiggle
was on the brief, for respondents in Nos. 18 and 19.
Mr. W. W. Montgomery, with whom Mr. Robert P.
Smith was on the brief, for respondent in No. 20.
Mr. Douglas Swift for respondent in No. 21.
PER CURIAM.

In these cases, the judgments were severally affirmed on
October 23, 1933, by an equally divided Court. 290 U. S.
591. Petitions for rehearing in Nos. 18, 19, and 21 were
denied on November 20, 1933. The mandates of the
Court were severally issued in the four cases on November
29, 1933. The present petitions for rehearing were filed
on May 21, 1934.
Section 1005 (a) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27,
44 Stat. 9, 110, 111, U.S.C., Tit. 26, § 640, with respect to
decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals, provides:
"Sec. 1005 (a). The decision of the Board shall become
final- . . .
(4) Upon the expifation of 30 days from the date of
issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such
Court directs that the decision of the Board be affirmed
or thepetition for review dismissed."
In view of the authoritative and explicit requirement
of the statute and of its application to these cases, the
petitions for rehearing are severally denied.
