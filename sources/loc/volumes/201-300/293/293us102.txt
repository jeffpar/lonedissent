Affirmed.
ROWLEY, TREASURER OF CONVERSE COUNTY,
WYOMING, ET AL. v. CHICAGO &kNORTHWESTERN RAILWAY CO.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOlk THE
TENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 9. . Argued October 10, 1934.-DQcided November 5, 1934.
1. The Court is reluctant to place constructions upon statA Atutes of
doubtful meaning, or to decide other questions of state law as to
which there may be substantial controversy, in advance of decision
by the state courts of last resort. P. 104.
2. The ascertainment of the value'of a railway system is not a matter
of arithmetical calculation and is rt governed by any fixed and
definite rule. Facts of great variety and number, estimates that
are exact and those that are approximations, forecasts based on
probabilities and contingencies have bearing and properly may be
taken into account to guide judgment in determining what is the
money equivalent-the actual value-of the property. P. 109.
3. An apportionment of system. value of a railroad for taxation in one
of several States traversed by its lines can not be adjudged arbitrary merely because the mileage basis was used, although the average value per mile in that State was much less than for the system
as a whole, where the mileage ratio was applied not singly but combined with others, such as the ratios of the traffic units, use of rolling stock and average of gross and net operating revenue in that
State to the system totals; where -the computation was tested by
other criteria, such as the relations between cost of reproduction
less depreciation ol .the local property and system value and between operating.iet revenues derived from that property and those
earned by the system; and where there is nothing to show that. the
assessment was excessive. P. 110.

Opinion of the Court.

4. Overvaluation by state tax officials resulting from error of judg.
ment will not support a claim of discrimination. There must be
something that amounts to an intentin, or the equivalent of fraudulent purpose, to disregard the fundamental principle of uniformity.
P. Ill.
5. Upon finding in. an injunction suit that a state tax violates the
equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because of
discrimination in assessment, the federal court should leae the
State free to reassess; it is without jurisdiction to fix the base and
amount of the tax that may be lawfully exacted. P. 112.

CEATzoRAuI, 292 U. S. 618, to review the affirmance of
a decree of the District Court holding state taxes on the
Railway Company's property in Wyoming arbitrary and
excessive and enjoining collection upon the condition that
the Company pay taxes on a reduced valuation made by
the court.
Mr. Ray E. Lee, Attorney General of Wyoming, and
Mr. Jame. A. Greenwood, with whom Mr. George A.
Weedell was on the brief, for petitioners.
Mr. Robert R. Rose, with whbm Messrs. Samuel H.
Cady, William T. Faricy, and Vincent Mulvaney were on
the brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
This suit was brought in the district court for Wyoming
by the company against the treasurers of four counties
to enjoin collection of a part of the taxes for 1931 levied
upon its railroad property therein. The laws of that
State required all taxable property to be assessed on the
basis of its actual value. See State Constitution, Art.
XV, § 11. Wyoming Compiled Statutes, 1931, §§ 115119, 115-511, 115-1804. The complaint rests upon the

104

claim that for a number of: years, including the one here
involved, the State acting through its board of equalization and other taxing authorities systematically and in4
tentionally discriminated against respondent's railroad
and in favor of all other property, in violation of the equal
protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in) that
it regularly taxed the railroad at about 1331/3% while taxing all other property at about 60% of actual Value. Respondent tendered and paid to the treasurer of each
county the amount it claimed would have been levied
against it if all taxable property had been assessed upon
the same basis of valuation. The total claimed by the four
counties was $168,606.12; respondent paid $101,163.67,
-leaving in controversy $67,442.45.
Petitioners' answer denied discrimination. There was
a trial at which much evidence was introduced. The district court upon specific findings of fact concluded that respondent's railroad property, i' Wyoming had been substantially and arbitrarily overvalued. It found that,
with exceptions that are here immaterial, all other property had been assessed at its actual value. It entered
a decree requiring respondent to pay additional taxes
.amounting in all to $33,519.46 and enjoining collection of
any part of the balance.
Petitioners seek reversal upon the ground that respondent failed to exhaust an administrative remedy open to it
by appeal from the determinatioh of the state board of
equalization to the district court under § 115-512, Wyoming Compiled Statutes, 1931.' They also maintain that
under § 115-311 respondent had an adequate remedy at
law and therefore was not entitled to relief in equity.
These contentions depend upon serious questions of Wyoming law which have not been decided by its highest
court. This court is reluctant, in advance of decision
thereon by the state courts of last resort, to construe state

statutes of doubtful meaning or to decide other questions
of state law as to which there may be substantial controversy.
In this case it is not necessary, for, upon an analysis of
the grounds of the decision below, it is clear that respondent was not entitled to an injunction. Respondent does
not challenge the finding that other property was assessed
at actual value, and so there remains only the clain that
its railroad was intentionally and arbitrarily overvalued
by about 33/3%.
The company had 278.35 miles of main line track in
Wyoming and that constituted 3.29% of the main line
track included in its system extending into nine States.
Neither it nor the board dealt with that in Wyoming as a
separate line; both appraised -it as a part of the system.
They took the value of the whole, attributed to Wyoming
a portion and divided it among the four counties. The
only matter in controversy is the amount to be assigned
to that State.
To ascertain system value, respondent made calculations based on a five year period, ending with 1930. It
found the average market value of its stocks and bonds.
deducted non-operating property locally taxed, added the
remainder ($385,800,085) to an amount produced by
capitalizing at 6% average net operating income ($364,771,720). The sum divided by two produced $375,285,902 which the board accepted for the purposes of its calculation, though one of its members testified "there are
certain flaws in it."
To ascertain the value to be taxed in Wyoming respondent found for each year and also the average for the
five-year period the percentages that Wyoming traffic
units (ton miles and passenger miles) bore to the system
total, the corresponding relation of use of rolling stock
(car miles and engine miles) and of gross operating rev-

reference to the market value of such properties, or
of the stocks and bonds .. or the present earnings . . . or the present or future earning capacity or
possibilities of such properties. It is claimed that the
valuations stated in this return do not represent the fair
cash value of the property for purposes of taxation. The
value as to the system ... and as to the part in ...Wyoming is clearly and fairly set [forth] by the figures contained in the exhibits attached to this return . . .and
which ... show that the total true value.., in ...Wyoming, or properly allocated to the State does not exceed

$5,849,570."
After receiving the return, the board found cost of reproduction new less depreciation of respondent's railroad
properties in Wyoming on the basis of an appraisal by
the Interstate Commerce Commission as of 1917 plus
later betterments to be $11,724,126, depreciated that at
the annual rate of 2.5% for 13 years and so produced
$8,436,076; ascertained the Wyoming 1930 net operating
income to be 2.23%,of the total for that year, applied
that ratio to system value ($375,285,902) and produced
$8,368,876. Each of the two last'mentiohed indications
of value is substantially more than the reproduction cost
liss depreciation given by respondent in its return. The
boatd, in order to equalize the valuation of respondent's
property with other Wyoming railroad properties, made
the assessment $7,989,587 which is 2.13% of system value.
This is considerably less than the cost figures stated in
the return. After notice of the assessment there was a
hearing at which respondent presented' the theory and
bases of its appraisal. It appears that upon further consideration the board took into account the facts that for
the five-year period Wyoming net revenue was 2.114% of
the system total; respondent's estimated cost of reproduction less depreciation of the Wyoming property was 2.21%
of the system value, and that one-half the sum of these

per'centages is 2.162%. Of the percentages used by the
respondent, the board accepted those based on traffic units
and use, of rolling stock, rejected that based on gross operating revenues, substituted for it one-half of the sum'
of the gross operating revenue percentage plus. the net
operating reyenue percentage, introduced the percentage
that Wyoming mileage is of system mileage and divided
the total by four, producing 2.1%. Its ascertainment of
the ratio used follows:

The board applied this percentage to system value and
so established the final assessment, $7,881,003.94, which
is less than the earlier one by more than $100,000. This
is about 63% of the mileage proportion of agreed systemvalue.
The district court rejected as without support respondent'6-use of' the gross operating revenue percentage. It
found that the board used the mileage basis 3.29%, without taking into account the fact that respondent's property in Wyoming measured on a mileage basis, was
greatly less in quantity, quality, cost and value than the
portion of its operating system located outside that State.
It was upon that ground that the court concluded that respondent's property "was substantially and arbitrarily
overassessed." And it condemned as unreasonable and
arbitrary the board's use of the mileage percentage. Then
proceeding to correct what it held to be the error of the
board, the court found one-third of the, sum of the percentages based on Wyoming and sy'stem traffic units, roll-

The ascertainment of the value of a railway system is
not a matter of arithmetical calculation- and is not governed by any fixed and definite rule. Facts of great variety and number, estimates that are exact and those that
are approximations, forecasts based on probabilities and
contingencies have bearing and properly may be taken
into account to guide judgment in determining vhat is
the money equivalent-the actual value-of the property. Boom Co. v. Patterson,98 U. S. 403, 407 et seq.

tion is to be made in the exercise of a reasonable judgment based on facts so pertinent and significant as to be'
of controlling weight as indications of the value of the
property.
Where, as in this case, the evidence requires a finding
that the railroad in one of the States reached by the
system is clearly shown to be worth much less than the
average value per mile of the system, an apportionment
on mileage necessarily assigns an excessive amount to that
State, and the use :of that basis as the sole measure for
apportionment must be condemned as arbitrary. Fargov.
Hart, 193 U.S. 490, 500. Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright,
249 U. S. 275, 282-283. Wallace v. Hines, 253 U. S. 66, 69.
Cf. Chicago & N. W. Ry. Co. v. Eveland, 13 F. (2d) 442,
447. In arriving at the relation between value in Wyoming and system value, the State board did not confine
its calculation to relative mileage.. That percentage combined with the other ratios, used in the calculation, produced 2.1% finally adopted. Nor did it limit its. consideration of -the problem to th elements employed to make
that oomputation. Among other things it took into account the cost of reproduction less depreciation of the
*Wyoming property; the relations between that figure and
the agreed system value, and between operating net revenues derived from the .Wyoming property and -those
earned by the system for the five-year period and for 1930.
Each of these is an indication that the value of the Wyoming property is substantially more than the assessment
in question.
The record shows that the board considered respondent's calculation. Refusal to. accept that formula as the
measure was not arbitrary. Respondent's use of the average of three ratios indicates that it realized that there were
substantial objections against each as the sole test. It is
obvious, eveni when results of operation over a substantial'

period are considered, that as a,matter of fact the value
of respondent's Wyoming line does not rise and fall with
decline and increase of ton miles, passenger miles, car
miles, engine miles or gross revenue in any other State or
upon the balance of the system. Moreover, by the use
of its formula respondent failed to take into account facts
that justly may be considered to have significant bearing
upon the relation between Wyoming value dnd system
value. Such, for example, are the length of line to be
assessed and the net operating revenues. The other factors that are shown to have been considered by the board
give substantial support to the percentage finally adopted
as the basis of the assessment.
. There is nothing in this record to suggest any lack of
good faith on the part of the board. Overvaluation resulting from error of judgment will not support a claim
of discrimination. There must be something that
amounts to an intention, or the equivalent of fraudulent
purpose, to .disregard the fundamental principle of uniformity. Sunday Lake. Iron Co. v. Wakefield, 247 U. S.

Cumberland Coal Co. v. Board, 284 U. S. 23, 28. There
was no discrimination dgainst respondent by undervaluation of the property of others. We find no substantial
support in the findings of the district court or in the evidence for the conclusion that the use that the state board
made of relative mileage to ascertain the'value of respondent's Wyoming railroad property was arbitrary or unreasonable or indeed erroneous, or for its conclusion that the
property was substantially or arbitrarily overvalued.
Respondent was not entitled to an injunction.
