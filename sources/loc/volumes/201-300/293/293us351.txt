Moreover, the Government expressly disclaimed the assertion of a preferred position.- Additional reasons are suggested for affirming'the judgment of the Court of Appeals: That the Government cannot recover on the'guaranty of prior endorsements, because it has failed to show damage, from the alleged
breach. That it cannot recover the money as having been
paid under a mistake, because it has failed to show "that
the defendant cannot retain the money with good conscience." Compare UnitedStates v. Chase National Bank,
252 U. S. 485, 495. That recovery must be denied, regardless of the foreign law, because on the agreed facts, the
Government is, under § 24 of the Code of the District,
"precluded from setting up the forgery."

same losses for reduction of income. P. 355.
As gr'inM for an action by a corporation to recover the amoumt of
an incomp tax assessed on a !op lida ted return and voluntarily
paid by the plaintiff, the plaintiff claimed that losses that accrued
to it during the tax year by reason of the liquidation in that year
of one of its subsidiaries, viz., the loss of the plaintiff's investment
in the subsidiary's stock and of money advanced to it, amounting,
above all credit,,to more than the amount of the tax, should have
been deducted in" the tax computation. Held, that the burden was
upon the plaintiff to prove that the losses claimed were not the reflections of losses suffered by the subsidiary and which had been
allowed for in the returns and tax assessments for that and prior
yei ; and that, upon the evidence, the burden was not sustained,
and the defendant's motion for judgment.in his favor should have
been granted. P. 356.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

lVespondent brought this action, in the district court for
northern California, to recover $143,122.23 it had paid as
income tax for 1923. The complaint alleges facts upon
which respondent claims to have been overassessed in that,
sum as a result of failure to take into account deductible
losses: One loss (S479.625) resulted from the liquidation
in 1923 of A. F. Thane & Company,; a wholly owned subsidiary." The other ($953.1.4.49) was the indebtedness

of that company to respondent, ascertained to be worthless and charged off by the latter in that year. Petitioner's answer put in issue some, and admitted other, '
allegations of the complaint. The parties stipulated for
trial by the court without a jury. The evidence consisted
of an agreed statement of facts and the separate and consolidated tax returns for 1920 to 1923, inclusive, of respondent, Thane & Company, and Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois. At the close of the evidence each party
moved for judgment. The court denied petitioner's motion, granted that of respondent and gave it judgment in
the amount sued for with interest and costs. The Circuit
Court of Appeals affirmed; 66 F. (2d) 895.
The allegations of the complaint admitted by the answer, the agreed statement and the tax returns show:
During 1918, A. F. Thane & Company had outstanding
600 shares of capital stock of the par value of $100 each.;
respondent owned 540, for which it had paid $31,500, and
A. F. Than-e owned 60. In 1920, the company increased
its capital to 5,000' shares, respondent subscribed and paid
to the company par value, $100 per share, for 3,960, and
Thane took the remaining 440 shares. In 1921, respondr
ent bought these shares for $52,125, And so became the
6 se
owner of all, for which it had paid $479,625. At the cl
of 1923, Thane & Company was dissolved and itsremaining assets were. transferred to respondent. Between
March 17, 1921, and the end of 1923, respondent had advanced to it and paid for its account large sums. After
deducting the amount repaid plus the value of the assets
transferred at liquidation, Thane & Company was indebted to respondent in- the sum of $953,134.49. Before
the end of 1923. respondent charged this off as a debt
ascertained to be worthless in that year.
From 1920 to 1923, inclusive, respondent, Thane &
Company and the Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois
made separate income tax returns and also consolidated

returns as affiliated corporations. Their income taxes
were paid on the latter basis.- In each year respondent
had a large net income and Thane & Company lost
heavily; the Pacific Lumber Company of Illinois lost
in the first and had relatively small net income in each of
.the other years.' Their separate returns for .1923 respectively showed net income of $1,379,494.78, net loss
of '$229,942.15, and net income of $8,809.83. The consolidafed return reported net income of $1,158,362.46-, on
which respondent paid $144,795.31 as the total income
tax. Upon examiriation and audit in the Bureau, a'
greater deduction Was made for depreciation than was
claimed, in the return, overpayment, was found in the
ariiount of'$1,673.08, and that was refunded.
Insisting that the losses here in question were deducti
ble, respondent filed a claim for refund of the balance,
$143,122.23. The letter of the deputy commissioner notifying it that the claim would be rejected stated that,
since Thane & Company was affiliated with respondent
and allowance was made, in computing consolidated net
income, for all deductible losses sustained by the subsidiary during the several years, a further deduction reflect'The tabulation is:

ing directly or indirectly the same losses was not allowable. And the claim was disallowed.
Petitioner's mction, at the close of- the evidence, for
judgment in his favor raised the question of law whether
the evidence is sufficient to warrant judgment' for re-:
spondent; and the trial court's decision of that question
was reviewable in the Circuit Court of Appeals and is
here for decision. United States v.: Jefferson Electric
Co., 291 U. S. 386, 407.
Section 240 (a) of the"Revenue Act of 1921 declares:
"That corporations which are affiliated within the meaning of this section may . . .. make separate returns or,
under regulations prescribed . . ..make a consolidated
return of net income . . . in which case the taxes thereunder shall be computed and determined upon the basis of
such return." 42 Stat. 227, 260. Treasury Regulations
62 provide: "Consolidated returns are based upon the
principle of levying the tax according to the true net income* and invested capital of a single enterprise. " .
[Art. 631.] Subject . . to the elimination of intercompany transactions . . . the consolidated taxable net
income shall be the combined net income of the several
corporations consolidated." Art. 636.
If not inconsistent with its obligation under the statute
accurately to. report taxable income for 1923, respondent
may deduct the losses it sustained in that year as the
result of its investment in the stock of Thane & Company
and its advances to or for that company. Burnet v.
Aluminum Goods Co., 287 U. S.544, 550.. But a consolidated return must truly reflect taxable income of the unitary business, and consequently it may not be employed to
enable the taxpayer to use more than once the same losses
for reduction of income. Losses of Thane & Company
that were subtracted from respondent's incoi.me are not
directly or indirectly again deductible, Handy & Har-

Ludey, 274 U. S. 295, 301. Ilfeld Co. v. Hernandez, 292
U. S. 62, 68. Respondent voluntarily paid the tax.
When disallowing the claim for refund, the Bureau notified it that losses in 1923 reflecting other deductions would
not be allowed. Presumably respondent had within its
control the records showing facts that would fully disclose the glations between such losses and those reported
in the returns of Thane & Company. Thc Circuit Court
of Appeals states that there is no evidence of double deduction or any specific instance of such deduction. But
that absence of proof does noL support the judgment.
Respondent had the affirmative of the issue, and the burden was on it to show that allowance of the deduction
claimed.would not amount to twice subtracting the same
loss. That is an essential fact which cannot be assumed.
Respondent may not rely on mere assertion or speculation.
Cochran v. United States, 254 U. S. 387, 393. Fidelity
Title & Trust Co. v. -United States, 259 U. S. 304, 306.

Compahiia General v. Collector,279 U. S. 306,310. United
States v. Jefferson Electric Co., supra, p. 400.
The evidence not only fails to establish that essential
fact, but is little, if any, less than enough to show that
the allowance of the deductions claimed would be a second use of the same losses. The details, given in the
tabular statement printed in the margin of an earlier
page of this opinion, show that the losses of Thane &
Company, which operated through consolidated returns
to reduce respondent's income taxed, amciunt in all to
more than respondent's asserted 1923 losses and to more
than its income taxed in that year. Thane & Company's
statements attached to its separate tax returns show liabilities in excess of assets in each year of the affiliated
period, increasing annually until, by the end of 1923, the
deficit had become $1,453,134.49. Prior to 1920, Thane

& Company had outstanding only $60,000 of capital stock,
90 per cent. of which was acquired by respondent for less
than par. During the affiliated period, its deductible
losses amounted to more than three times its capital.
While it is conceivable that, as suggested by respondent,
the losses do not necelssarily indicate that thereby Thane
& Company became unable to pay its debts, the circumstances tend strongly to indicate that they did cause its
breakdown, resulting in respondent's 1923 losses here
claimed. If these losses did -not cause, or are not reflected
in, those sustained by respondent in 1.923 as the result
of its investment in and advances to that company, it
reasonably may be presumed that respbndent would have
shown that fact.
The trial court should have granted petitioner's motionfor judgment in his favor
