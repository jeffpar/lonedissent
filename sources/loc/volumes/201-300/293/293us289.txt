REVENUE.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
NINTH CIRCUIT.

No. 107. Argued November 13, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934
1. In consolidated income tax returns made by two affiliated corporations under § 240 of the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926, and
supplementary Treasury Regulations, there cannot be deductions
of amortized discount on bonds which were issued by one ot the
affiliates and were purchased and are held by the other, since the
anticipated payment of the face of the bonds at maturity, which.
alone gives occasion fur amortizing the discount, isan intercompany transaction. P. 290.
2. A Treasury Regulation construing § 234 (a) (1) of the Revenue
Act of 1'921 as permitting a corporation to deduct charitable donations from gross income, as an " ordinary and necessary -expense,"
when made to an institution conducted for the benefit of the donor's employees or when it is a consideration for a benefit flowing
directly to the corporation as an incident of its business,-held to
have the force of law', in view of subsequent reinactmentsof the same
statutory .provision, the regulation continuing unchanged. P. 293.
3. The question whether ii the particular case a 'contribution by a
corporation to a Community Chest represen.ted a consideration for
a benefit flowing directly to the corporation as an incident of its
business, is a question of fact, as to which a ruling by the Commissioner disallowing deductions of such contributions from gross income is presumably correct. P. 294.
4. Review by this Court of determinations of the Board of Tax Appeals is limited to questions of law raised by its findings or its failure to make findings required by the statute. P. 294.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

Mr. Robert N. Anderson, with whom Solicitor General
Biggs, Assistant Attorney General Widenan, and Messrs.
James 11. Morris, Sewall Key, and A. F. Prescott were on
the brief, for respondent.
MR.

JUSTICE STONE

delivered the opinion of the Court.

In this case certiorari was granted,. " limited to the
question of the right of the taxpayer to deductions (a) on
account of amortization of bond discount, and (b) on
account of contributions to the San Francisco Community
Chest."
During each of the years 1923 to 1926, inclusive, petitioner and two corporations affiliated with it filed consolidated income tax returns on the accrual basis. In each
year one of the affiliated corporations deducted, from gross
income, amortized discount allowed upon an issue of its
bonds in 1912. In computing the taxable income to beassessed to petitioner, the parent corporation, under the
applicable Revenue Acts of 1921 (c. 136, 42 Stat. 227),
1924 (c. 234, 43 Stat. 253) and 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9), the
Commissioner refused to allow the deduction of so much
of the amortized discount as was applicable to bonds,
issued by its affiliate, which petitioner had acquired by
purchase. He also refused to allow credit for the contributions to the Community Chest as not an ordinary
and ncessary expense, de(uction of which the statute
per'mits, His action was sustained both by the Board of
Tax Appeals, 25 B. T. A. 305, and the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, 69 F. (2d) 676.
1. It is no longer open to question that amortized bond
discount may be deducted in the separate return of a
single taxpayer. See No. 51, Helvering v. Union Pacific
R. Co., decided this (lay. ante, p. 282. But the Government insists that the deduction by one affiliate, in a consolidated return, of amortized discount upon its bonds;

Opinion of the Court.

which are owned by another affiliate, involves an "intercompany transac tion" which, under the applicable
statutes and regulations, mast be eliminated from .the
computation of the tax in order to arrive at the true
taxable income.
Section 240 of the Revenue Ats of 1921, 1924 and 1926
extends to affiliated corporate taxpayers the privilege of
making a consolidated tax return, subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by treasury. regulations.
The purpose of the section' was to provide a method of
computing the tax upon the true net income of whit is
in practical effect a single business enterprise, with substantially common ownership, as though it were that of
a single taxpayer, despite the fact that it is carried o n by
separate corporations whose tax would otherwise be independently computed. See Burnet v. Aluminum- Goods
Mfg. Co., 287 U. S. 544, 547; Handy & Harman v. Burnet, 284 U. S.136, 140; Atlantic City Electri'c Co. v. Commissioner, 288 U. S. 152, 154; Woolford Realty Co. v.
Rose, 286 U. S. 3i9; Appeal of Gould Coupler'Co., 5 B.
* T. A. 499, 514-516; cf. Treasury Regulations 62, Art.
636, under the 1921 Act; T. R. 65, Art. .636, under the
1924 Act; T. R. 69, Art. 635, under the 1926 Act.
.Each of the regulations controlling consolidated returns, under the applicable Revenue Acts, directs that*
only one specificcredit of $2,000, which § 236 (b) allows
to each individual taxpayer, shall be allowed to the consolidated group, and provides that " subject to the provisions covering the determination of taxable net income
of separate corporations,, and subject further to the elimination, of intercompany transactions (whether or not resulting:in any profit or loss to the separate corporations),
the consolidated taxable. net incojme shall be the combined 'net income of the several corporations consolidated." It is by the elimination of intercompany trans-

actions from the computation, in order to ascertain "the
combined net income of the several corporations consolidated." that the purpose of the statute is effected. See
Burnet v. Aluminum Goods Mfg. Co., supra, 549, 550.
The Government, having thus conferred upon groups of
affiliated taxpayers the privilege of computing their tax
as though they were a single taxpaying entity, it would
require plain language in statute and regulations to support the conclusion that it was also intended that they
should retain the advantages which, before affiliation, attached peculiarly to their status as independent tax computing entities. The regulations are aimed at the prevention 'of a double advantage, to be secured only if
affiliated taxpayers are allowed to treat themselves, at the
saine moment, as one or many, according to their convenience for purposes of tax computation.
Amortized bond discount is deductible from the taxpayer's gross income only by way of anticipation of payment of the bonds at maturity. It is then that the taxpayer. pays the difference, between the amount realized
upon the sale of the bonds and their par value, which is
the subject of the amortization. Helvering v. Union
Pacific R. Co., supra. Here the payment anticipated is
from one affiliate to another, an intercompany transaction. If we eliminate it from the computation of income
upon the consolidated return, as the regulation directs,,
there is no anticipated payment of the discount to be
amortized and no basis for the deduction.
A single taxpayer who had purolrsed his own bonds
before maturity could not afterwards deduct, from gross
income, the amortized discount on the bonds, in anticipation of their payment at maturity. This is equally the
case where the obligor and obligee are affiliated corporations'claiming the.benefit of a statute which permits them
to compute their tax as though they were one. It is true

OLD MISSION CO. v. HELVERING.

Opinion of the Court.

that in either case the bondholder may sell his bonds before maturity, and thus renew his obligation to pay them.
But.in neither is the taxpayer in a position to rectuire the
Government to anticipate an event which may never occur, by conferring upon him the benefit of a deduction to
which,. without its occurrence, he would not be entitled.
Having elected to take the benefit of affiliation, the taxpayer cannot complain of a burden Which is inseparable
from the benefit and which finds its source in the very
method of computing the tax from which the benefit is
derived.
2. The privilege of deducting charitable donations from
gross income, conferred on individual taxpayers by § 214
(a) of the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926, has not
been extended to corporations. A proposal to extend it
to them was rejected by Congress pending the passage of
the Revenue Act of 1918. Cong. Rec., House, Vol. 56,
Part 10, 10426-10428. Section 234 (a) (1) of the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924 and 1926 authorizes corporations
to deduct from gr6ss income "all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year
Article 562 of
in carrying on any trade or business."
Treasury Regulations 62, interpretatiie of the 1921 Act,
declared that corporations were not entitled to deduct
charitable donations. But it recognized the right to deduet donations "-made by a corporation for purposes connected with the operation of its business . . . when
limited to charitable institutions, hospitals or educational
institutions conducted for the benefit of its employees,"
and also donations " which legitimately represent a consideration for a benefit flowing directly to the corporation
as an incident of its business." These provisions were
retained, without substantial change, in the regulations
promulgated under the 1924, 1926 and 1928 Acts. Art.
562 of T. R. 65, 69; Art. 262 of T. R. 74. As § 234 (a)

(1) to which they pertain has been reenacted in several
revenue acts, the regulation now has the force of law.
McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., 283 U. S. 488, 492;
Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 288
U. S. 269, 273.
It is a question of fact in each case whether a donatipn is made to an institution conducted for the benefit
of the donor's employees or is consideration for a benefit
flowing directly to the donor as an incident of its business.
Here the ruling of the Commissioner, that the deduction
was not permissible under the statute and regulations,
presumably rests upon a correct determination of the
facts. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U. S. 111. 115. The
Board of Tax Appeals found that the gifts to the San
Francisco Community Chest were apportioned among the
charitable organizations of the City and that the gifts
of petitioner were made in the belief that " they resulted
in good will toward the petitioner and increased its business." But the Board made no finding of any direct
benefit to petitioner's employees or business which the
regulations contemplate. Nor was there evidence before
it to support such a finding. Our review of determina'tions by the Board is limited to questions of law raised by
its findings or its failure to make findings required by the
statute. See Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279
U. S. 716, 728; Phillips v.. Commissioner, 283 U. S. 589,
599. 600. C.omipare Kendrick Coal'(( Dock Co. v. Commissioner. 29 F. (2d) 559. 564 (C. C. A. 8th); Commissioner v. Langwell Real.Estate Corp., 47 F. (2d) 841, 842
(C. C. A.-7th).
Affirmed.
AIR. JUSTICE BUTLER and MR. JUSTICE ROBERTS think

that so much of the judgment as sanctions the Commissioner's refusal to deduct the bond discount should be
reversed.
