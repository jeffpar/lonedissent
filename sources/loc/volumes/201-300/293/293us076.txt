the court, has the right and power to determine for itself
who the receiver shall be and to make such distribution
of the funds realized within its own jurisdiction as will
protect the rights of local parties interested therein, and
not permit a foreign court to prejudice the rights of local
creditors by removing assets from the local jurisdiction
without an order of the court or its approval as to the
officer who shall act in the holding and distribution of
the property recovered." The nature of the rule of Booth
v. Clark is shown further by the fact that, when by statute the appointment of the receiver operates to transfer
title, the foreign receiver may sue in the federal court
for another State. See Bernheimerv. Converse, 206 U. S.
516; compare Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243;
Clark v. Williard, 292 U. S. 112.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and
the cause is remanded to it for the determination of the
questions relating to the liability of the defendants decided by the District Court and presented by the appeal
and cross-appeal.

LONG v. ANSELL.
CERTIORARI TO tHE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

No. 18.

Argued October 15, 1934.-Decided November 5, 1934.

1. A Senator of the United States, while in the District of Columbia
in attendance at a session of the Senate, is immune under Constitutioh, Art. I, ยง 6 , cl.1, from arrest in a civil case but not from the
service of a summons. P. 82.
2. This -constitutional privilege must not be confused with the common law rule that witnesses, suitors and their attorneys, while in
attendance in connection with the conduct of one suit, are immune
from service in another. P. 83.
63 App. D. C. 68; 69 F. (2d) 386, affirmed.

Argument for Petitioner.

CERTIORARI, 292 U. S. 619, to review the affirmance of
an order denying a motion to quash a summons and the
service thereof in an action for libel.

Mr. Seth W. Richardson, with whom Messrs. Joseph E.
Davies, Raymond N. Beebe, and Adrian F. Busick were
on the brief, for petitioner.
It seems clear that, prior to the enactment of 12 and
13 W. III and 10 G. III, the privilege from arrest of members of Parliament embraced privilege from service of civil
process. Cassidy v. Stewart, 2 M. & G. 437; State v.
District Court, 34 Wyo. 288; Bolton v. Martin, (Pa.) 1
Dall. 296. But, in view of those enactments and the difference in jurisdictional conditions, the status of the privilege in England affords little aid in the determination of
the question here submitted.
It would seem, however, that, in framing the constitutional provision, the framers must have had in mind the
broad meaning of the word "arrest," which, exclusive of
statute, had previously prevailed in England, because the
early cases in the United States all followed this broad
interpretation of the word "arrest."
Language similar to that of Constitution, Art. I, ยง 6,
cl 1, is found in nearly all of the constitutions of the
States, and has been the subject of diverse interpretations.
That the privilege referred to in the Federal Constitution applies only to civil cases, was settled by Williamson
v. United States, 207 U. S. 425. Consequently, the only
question remaining is whether the word "arrest" refers
only to those few remaining instances of civil arrest where
actual detention of the person exists, or, more broadly construed, applies to the service of civil process upon the
member of Congress, as originally in England, and as held
in early cases immediately following the adoption of the
Constitution.

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Argument for Petitioner.

293 U. S.

It is, of course, freely conceded that the authorities are
not now in accord. The decisions opposed are collected
in the opinion below.
Applicable decisions and dicta are to be found in: Miner
v. Markham, 28 Fed. 387; Bolton v. Martin, (Pa.) 1 Dall.
296; Geyer's Lessee v. Irwin, (Pa.) 4 Dall. 107, followed
in Gray v. Still, 13 W. N. C.- 59, and Ross v. Brown, 7 Pa.
Co. Ct. 142; Doty v. Strong, 1 Pinney 84; Anderson v.
Roundtree, 1 Pinney 115; Robbins v. Lincoln, 27 Fed.
342; Welsh v. Mooney, 33 Oh. Cir. Ct. 214; Note, 76 Am.
St. Rep. 534. These clearly support the rule that freedom
from arrest includes freedom from service of civil process.
It is believed that most of the opposing decisions present
various characteristic differences which should have careful consideration. Distinguishing: United States v.
Cooper, 4 Dall. 341; Case v. Rorabacker, 15 Mich. 537;
Peters v. League, 13 Md. 58; Respublica v. Duane, 4
Yeates 347; People v. Hofstadtor,258 N. Y. 425; Phillips
v. Browne, 270 Ill. 450.
A nonresident who is present in the jurisdiction as'suitor
or witness may not lawfully be served with process. This
privilege is not dependent upon constitution or statute;
it .has grown out of public policy in the public interest.
Stewart v. Ramsden, 242 U. S. 128; Wheeler v. Flintoff,
156 Va. 92&; Arnett v. Smith, 165 Miss. 53; Zimmerman
v. Buffington, 121 Neb. 670; State v. District Court, 34
Wyo. 288; Murrey v. Murrey, 216 Cal. 707; Higgins.v.
California Growers, 288 Fed. 550. It has been extended
to national bank officials while attending conferences in
other States upon the request of the Governor of a Federal
Reserve Bank. Filer v. McCormick, 260 Fed. 309. The
public nature of his service, its importance to his State,
and its presumed supreme necessity to the Government,
bespeak a greater need for this privilege in the case of a
member of Congress than for the other classes of persons
mentioned.

LONG v. ANSELL.
76

Argument for Respondent.

The defendant is only present in the District of Columbia as a member of Congress in attendance upon his official duties. His domicile and residence are in the Statc
of Louisiana,'where he abides. Courts of Louisiana stand
open to the plaintiff to litigate any cause of action which
he may have; and the law ought not to deny to the
defendant, as a member of Congress, either under the constitutional provision, or under the principles "of general
law, the privilege which it so freely extends to litigants,
witpesses, and even to individuals, on errands connected
with the public interest..
Mr. Samuel T. Ansell submitted, pro se.
We rest our case upon the opinion of the Court of Appeals and Article I, ยง 6, of the Constitution. "Arrest"
means actual detention of the person.
-An examinatipn of the cases cited by petitioner requires us to ,say that they are not of a character to merit
serious consideration or extended discussion.
The law, as we think it has ever been applied in this
jurisdiction from the earliest times, was long ago authoritatively declared in Merrick & Durant. v. Giddings, 1
McArthur & Mackey 55, and Howard v. Trust Co., 12
App. D. C. 222, in able and exhaustive opinions; and now
again by the Court of Appeals in the instant case. These
decisions are in entire accord with Williamson V. -United
States, 207 U. S. 425, in which this Court manifestly
saw no "supreme necessity to the Government" for
liberalizing the immunity beyond strict constitutional
requirement.
Petitioner's plea made to the courts below and now to
the highest of American tribunals seems, to us at least,
strikingly, almost disturbingly, strange and foreign-a
plea for senatorial prerogative that places the personal
wrongs done by a Senator to a private citizen beyond the
effective reach of the law. He contends for
a judicial

enunciation of a public policy rule under which the District of Columbia would become a retreat in which Senators, Representatives, and everybody else engaged here
in public service, would be free from answering for their
breaches of contract obligations and their tortious acts
done to the person or property of the citizen. He urges
that this Court should require the courts here to adopt
what he regards as more modern public policy, and, without constitutional or statutory provision, extend the fullest immunity from civil suit not only to suitors and witnesses, but to any person who comes, or is brought, into
a foreign jurisdiction of which he is not a resident, on a
judicial or public errand and, a fortiori, tO a Senator of
the United States. The "supreme necessity to the Government," it is said, to which private rights must yield,
requires that a Senator must not be "subject to the menace of being harassed by private litigation in the District
of Columbia." If a Senator, or any of the thousands engaged here in the service of the public, injure or destroy
the person, property, or reputation of a citizen, or flout
his obligations to merchant, tailor, butcher, baker, this
honorable Court is asked to say that the injured citizen
shall have no redress in the courts here where the wrong
is done, and must be content to follow the wrongdoing
Senator into his own bailiwick-poor right indeed.
Experience, we think, would suggest no judicial extension beyond the privileges and immunities fairly established by the specific provision of the Constitution. We
are insensible to. the argument that this Court should deduce out of the Constitution or its concept of public
policy the remarkable immunity contended for.

the District, an action for libel against Huey P. Long. of
Louisiana. The summons was served on the defendant
within the District. It directed him to answer and show
cause why the plaintiff should not have judgment for the
cause of action stated in his declaration. The defendant,
appearing specially, and solely for the purpose, filed on
April 25, 1933, a motion to quash the summons and the
service thereof on the following ground:
"The summons was issued on Monday, March 27, 1933,
and served on the defendant on Monday, April 3, 1933,
whereas the first session of the Seventy-third Congress
was convened on the ninth day of March, 1933, and has
remained continuously in session since that date and was
in session on the dates of the issuance and service of the
said summons (of which fact defendant prays the court
to take judicial notice), and the defendant as alleged is
a United States Senator who was in attendance upon the
meetings of the first session of the Seventy-third Congress
of the United States and the summons and service thereof
is invalid- and of no legal effect whatsoever because in
violation of Article I, Section 6, Clause 1, of the Constitution of the United States, which provides that Senators
and Representatives of the United States 'shall in all
cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace be
privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and returning from the same.'
On May 9, 1933, the Supreme Court of the District
denied the motion, but stayed further proceedings for
twenty days pending application to the Court of Appeals
of the District for a special appeal. That coirt allowed
the appeal. On February 5, 1934, it :affirmed the order
denying the motion to quash. 63 App. D. C. 68; 69 F.

gress, while in attendance within the District, immunity
in civil cases not only from arrest, but also from service
of process. Neither the Senate, nor the House of Representatives, has ever asserted such a claim in behalf of its
memblrs. Clause 1 defines the extent of the immunity.
Its language is exact and leaves no room for &'construction which would extend the privilege beyond the terms of
the grant. In Kimberly v. Butler, Fed. Cases No. 7,777,
Mr. Chief Justice Chase, sitting in the Circuit Court for
the District of Maryland, held that the privilege was
limited to exemption from arrest. Compare Mr. Justice
Grier, sitting in the Circuit Court of the District of New
Jersey in Nones v. Edsall, Fed. Cases No. 10,290. The
courts of the District of Colum4ia, where the question has
been raised from time to time since 1868, have consistently denied the immunity asserted, Merrick v. Giddings, McArthur & Mackey 55, 67; Howard v. Citizens'
Bank & Trust Co., 12 App. D. C. 222.1 State cases passing on similar provisions so hold.'
History confirms the conclusion that the immunity is
limited to arrest. See opinion of Mr. Justice Wylie in
Merrick v. Giddings. The cases cited- in support of the
contrary view rest largely upon doubtful notions as to
the historic privileges of members of Parliament before
the enactment in 1770 of the statute of 10 George III, c.
50. 3 That act declared that members of Parliament

should be subject to civil process, provided that they were
not "arrested or imprisoned." Whn the Constitution
was adopted, arrests in civil suits were still common in
America.' It is only to such arrests that the provision
applies. Williamson v.United States,'207 U. S. 425.
The constitutional privilege here asserted must not be
confused with the common law rule 'that witnesses, suitors
and their attorneys, while in attendance in connection
with the conduct of one suit, are immune from service
in another. That rule of practice is founded upon the
needs of the court, not upon the convenience or preference of the individuals concerned. And -the immunity
conferred by the court is extended or withheld as judicial
necessities require. โขSee Lamb v. Schmitt, 285 U. S. 222,

Pinney 115; Miner v. Markham, 28 Fed. 387. The first of these
cases relied upon a passage in Blackstone in which it is stated that
no member of either house may be "served with any process of the
courts of law ... without a breach of the privilege of parliament."
The passage appears as quoted in. the fourth edition of Blackstone
.(1771), v. 1, p. 165. In the fifth edition (1773), however, the phrase
"served with any process of the courts of law" is deleted and other
changes made in the same paragraph, so as to correspond with the
statute of 10 George III, c. 50. InMiner v. Markham, the passage is
quoted in its original form.'
