INTERNAL

CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 6.

Argued October 9, 10, 1934.-Decided November 5, 19 4.

1. The base for computing tne 15 per cent. deduction allowable for
charitable contributions under § 23 (n) 6f the Revenue Act of 1928
is the "net income" defined by § 21 and includes capital net gain,
even though the taxpayer elect to be taxed on capital net gain at
the reduced rate prescribed by § 101 (a). P. 150.
2. This construction of the Act is required by its language and legislative history. P. 147.
3. The right of the taxpayer in computing net income to make deductions for charitable contributions, as expressly provided by § 23 (n)
of the Act, is not modified by § 101, which merely prescribes a
method for taxing a portion of the net income (capital net gain) at
a special rate. P. 150.
4. The allowance of deductions on account of charitable contributions
and the reduction of the rate of tax on capital gains were liberalizations of the law in the taxpayer's favor, based upon considerations
of public policy, and are not to be narrowly construed. Pp.
150-151.

is the same in both, and statement of the facts in No. 6
will suffice.
In 1928 respondent haft a net 4ncome (before any deduction for contributions to charity) of approximately
$500,000. Some $211,000 of this was gain from the sale
of capital assets, upon which she elected to be taxed at
the rate of' 121/2 per cent. pursuant to § 101 of the Act.
During the year she made charitable contributions, as defined in the statute, to the amount of approximately $44,000. In her return she deducted the amount of the contributions from her total net income. She paid tax on
$211,000 of the net income, after the deduction, at the
rate of 121/2. per cent.- and on the balance at normal and
surtax rates. The Commissiqner of Internal Revenue
ruled the respondent could not use the $500,000 of net income as a base on which to calculate the 15 per cent. deduction for charitable contributions, but must first subtract the $211,000 of net gain on sale of capital assets
and use only the balance of $289,000 of ordinary net income. A reduction- of the allowable deduction for
charitable contributions to about $40,000, and a deficiency
in tax paid of about $1,000; resulted. The Board of Tax
Appeals sustained the Commissioner, but the Circuit
Court of Appeals, by a divided court, reversed the Board.'
We granted certiorari.

tions is to be calculated, the petitioner would substitute
"ordinary net income" as defined in § 101.

So to read

the Act would violate its plain terms and run counter to
the history of the legislation.
The scheme of all the Revenue Acts since that of 1916
has been to sweep all income Of every sort, including capital gains, into what is denomihated gross income and to
authorize certain deductions therefrom in &det tW arrive
at net income,-the base for calculation of the tax. In
the Act of October 3, 1917,8 Congress, in order to encourage gifts to religious, educational and other charitable objects, granted the privilege of deducting such gifts from
gross income, but limited the
deduction to 15 per
cent. of the taxpayer's net income, calculated in the first
instance without reference to the amount of such contributions. All of the later. Acts have contained a like
provision. .The Acts provide that the taxpayer shall first
deduct fror gross income the'total of all permissible deductions save that for. cofitributions, thus arriving at a
provisional net income, and then deduct therefrom hi!
contributions, but in no event to an amount greater than
fifteen per cent. of the provisional -net income: By the last.
mentioned operation the final net income-the base for
calculation of the tax-is ascertained. The relevant sections of the Act of 1928 are typical. They are copied in
the margin.'

Commencing with the Revenue Act of 1921 Congress,
in order to encourage realization of profits on capital
assets, saw fit to relieve- gain thus derived of the heavy
surtaxes then applicable, and to permit the payment of
tax at a flat rate of 12 per cent. on so much of the
taxpayer's income as represented the net gain from capital
transactions.5
The accomplishment of this purpose of applying two
rates to two different kinds of net income, required new
provisions as to the base for each rate. Section 101 of
the Revenue Act of 1928 prescribes the method to be followed. So far as material it is set forth in the margin6
or use of or interest in such property; also from interest, rent, divi.dends, securities, or the. transactioni of any business carried on for*
gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source
whatever.
Sec. 23. Deductions From Gross Income.
In 'computing net income there shall be allowed as deductions:
(n) Charitable and other contributions.-In the case of an individual, contributions or gifts made within the taxable year tb or for
the use of:
(2) any corporation,, or trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable,
scientific, literary, or educational purposes ...
to an amount which in all the above cases combined does not exceed
15 per centum of the'taxpayer's net income as computed without the
benefit of this subsection. . . . (45 Stat. 797, 799, 801.)

election of the taxpayer, be levied, collected, r,'4 paid, in lieu of all

Opinion of the Court.

In extending this relief to taxpayers, Congress might have
modified the privilege theretofore existing with respect
to charitable contributions, by directing that they should
other taxes imposed by this title, a tax determined as follows: a
partial tax shall first be computed upon the basis of the ordinary net
income at the rates and in the manner as if this section had not been
enacted and the total tax shall be this amount plus 12% per centum
of the capital net gain.
(b) Tax in case of capital net loss.--In the case of any taxpayer,
other than a corporation, who for any taxable year sustains a capital
net loss (as hereinafter defined in this section), there shall be levied,
collected, and paid, in lieu of ali other taxes imposed by this title, a
tax determined as follows: a partial tax shall first be computed upon
the basis of the ordinary -net income at the rates and in the manner
as if this section had not been enacted, and the total tax shall be this
amount minus 12Y per centum of the capital net loss; but in no case
shall the tax of a taxpayer who has sustained a capital net loss he
less than the tax computed without regard to the provisions of this
section.
(c) Definitios.-For the purposes of this title(1) "Capital gain" means taxable gain from the sale or exchange
of capital assets consummated after December 31, 1921.
1 (2) "Capital loss" means' deductible loss resulting from the sale
or exchange of capital assets.
(3)" Capital deductions" means such deductions as are allowed
by section 23 for the purpose of computing net income, and are properly allocable to or chargeable against capital assets sold or exchanged
during the taxable year.
(4) "Ordinary deductions" means the deductions allowed. by section 23 other than capital losses and capital deductions.
(5) "Capital net gain" means the excess of the total amount of
capital gain over the sum of (A) the capital deductions and capital
losses, plus (B) the amount, if any, by which 'the ordinary deductions exceed the gross income computed without including capital
gains.
(6) "Capital net loss" means the excess of the sum of the capital
losses plus the capital deductions over the total amount of capital
gain.
(7) "Ordinary net income" means the net income, computed in
accordance with the provisions of this title, after excluding all items
of capital gain, capital loss, and. capital deductions. (45 Stat. 811;
U. S. C. Tit, 26, § 2101.)

be deducted. solely from capital net gain or should be apportioned and deducted ratably from ordinary net income
and from capital net gain. The Acts, however, evince no
such purpose. In the Act of 1928, as will be seen by reference to §§ 21, 22 and 23 (supra, note 4), the statutory
concept of net income is preserved. These sections are
found in Part II of Title I, which deals with "Computation of Net Income." Section 101, on the other hand, is
found under "Supplemental Provisions," and is captioned
"Supplement A-Rates of Tax." It is obviously directed
to the matter of computation of tax on a portion of net
income as defined in § 21. There is nothing novel in such
a division of the statutory net income into parts for the
.purpose of applying different :.tates of tax, as witness the
provisions fixing the rates on those portions of the entire
net income attributable to dividends, earned income, interest on United States obligations, and gains from the
sale. of mines, and allowing credits for dependents.!
The plain requirements of § 101 are that in ascertaining ordinary net income there shall be excluded from the
computation only items of capital gain, capital loss, and
capital deductions. Charitable contributions covered by
§ 23 (n) obviously are not- capital deductions as defined
by § 101 .(c) (3), but on the contrary are "ordinary deductions" within the meaning of § 101 (.c) (4).
By the express words of § 23 (n) charitable contributions are to be deducted to ascertain net income as defined.
in § 21; and nothing in § 101, which prescribes merely a
method for segregating a portion of that net income for
taxation at a special rate, in any wise alters the right of
the taxpayer to take 'the:. deduction in accordance with
§ 23 (n).
If the meaning of the Act were doubtful, we should
still reach the same conclusion. The exemption of in7 See §§ 25, 31, and 102 of the Revenue Act of 1928, 45 Stat. 802,

come devoted to charity and the reduction of the ra-te of
tax on capital gains were liberalizations of the law in
the taxpayer's favor, were begotten from motives of public policy, and are not to be narrowly construed. Nor
should the reduction in the rate of tax on capital gain,
first granted in the Revenue Act of 1921, be held to circumscribe the privilege granted in the earlier Acts, and
retained in later ones, with respect to charitable contributions, unless that result be plainly required by the language used. As has been shown the statutes if read as
written lead to a contrary result. Moreover, from 1923
to 1932 the Commissioner uniformly ruled that the deduction for charitable cortributions was to be taken from
net income before computation of the tax and hence in
whole from ordinary net income.8 The reenactment in
later Acts of the sections permitting the deduction indicate Congressional approval of this administrative interpretation.
The judgments are
