SCHNELL ET AL. v. THE VALLESCURA.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 134.

Argued November 14, 1934.-Decided December 3, 1934.

1. The provision of § 3 of the Harter Act, relieving vessels and their
owners from the consequences of " fault or error in navigation or
management" of the vessels, does not relate to damage caused to
cargo by failure to care for it properly on the voyage, e. g., failure
to give proper ventilation to a shipment of onions, causing decay.
P. 303.
2. It is the general rule that a carrier by sea who delivers in bad
condition cargo that he received for shipment in good condition
must bear the loss unless he can bring himself within some common
law or stipulated exception to his general liability. P.303.
3. To such exceptions the law itself annexes a condition that they
shall relieve the carrier from liability for loss from an excepted
cause only if in the course of the voyage he has used due care to
guard against it; and this is recognized and continued in the first
section of the Harter Act, which makes it unlawful to insert any
clause in a bill of lading whereby the carrier shall be relieved of
liability for negligence. P. 304.
4. A stipulation in a bill of lading excepting liability for damage to
perishable cargo by " decay" relates tb decay due to inherent defects in the cargo or caused by excepted perils of the sea; it leaves
the carrier liable for decay resulting from negligent stowage of the
cargo or failure to care for it properly during the voyage. P. 305.

Argument for Respondent.

5. It appeared by the evidence that decay of a cargo of onions was
the result of poor ventilation caused by closure of hatches and
ventilators for-many hours during the voyage, and that for a specified part of this time the closure was proper because of bad weather,
but for the rest of the. time it was improper. Held that the
burden was on the carrier to show how much of *the damage was
due to the sea peril (excepted in the bill of lading); and that,
failing in this, the ship was liable for the entire loss. P. 306.

An exception in a bill of lading does not exempt the

Where the nature of the case precludes the ascertain-

ment of the amount of damages with certainty, or where
it seems impossible to distinguish between the consequences that were lawfully originated and those unlawfully imposed, the wrongdoer must .bear the entife loss,

by the exercise of due skill ahd care have averted the
decay.
Damage due to inherent vice, defect or disease of the
thing carried, independent of the act of man, is included
within damage resulting from Act of God, from liability
for 'which the carrier is exempted at common law. Warden
v. Greer, 6 Watts (Pa.) 424; Nugent v. Smith, 1 C. P. D.
19, 423, 441; Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 282.
Special contracts relieving the carrier from liability for
damage that generally happens, or as often as not may
happen, without negligence on his part or on the .part of
any other human actor, are deemed reasonable and liber.ally construed.. York Co. v. Central Railroad, 3 Wall.
107; Cau v. Texas & Pacific Ry. Co., 194 U. S. 427. And
particularly is that true of damage developing from within
the goods themselves, such as decay. Clark v. Barnwell,
supra, at p. 282; Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357,
380; The Florinda, 31 F. (2d) 262, 264; The Toyohashi
Maru, 13 F. (2d) 871.
In such case there is no room for the presumption of
the common law that the particular kind of damage complained of happened by reason of the negligence of the
carrier, or that because he or his servants had the goods in
their exclusive possession at the time the decay set in, they
were in any better position than the shipper himself to
explain the cause of such decay. It was particularly
appropriate, therefore, in the carriage on long ocean voyages of goods particularly susceptible to decay, that the
parties should by agreement substitute their own more
rational presumption for that of the common law.
In-view of the Spanish onion's high susceptibility to
decay, in view of the fact that such decay can only develop
from infection by, and rapid multiplication of, bacteria
and spores operating in mysterious and uncertain fashion
upon the inner tissues of. the onion, and in view of the fact

SCHNELL v. THE VALLESCURA.
296

Argument for Respondent.

that there is no way of determining whether the onion is
so infected or diseased by examining it from the outside,
until the decay is well advanced, all as shown by the uncontradicted proofs herein, it becomes at once obvious that,
for the carrier to have attempted their transportation
across the Atlantic under any other sort of an arrangement,
would have been most unreasonable. And certainly it was
at the very least fitting and proper that the carrier's common-law insurer risk of decay should be assumed by the
shipper, and by him placed, if he felt so advised, with an
insurance company especially organized and equipped to
bear such risks.
Once the damage has been shown to fall prima facie
within the exception, the burden is upon the goo" ,' owner
to show, not merely negligence on the part of the carrier,
even though concurring negligence, but, in addition, that
such negligence was the efficient cause of the loss; that the
loss could have been avoided or prevented by the exercise
of due skill and care on the part of the carrier. Clark v.

from a given wrong but is uncertain in amount, he that
has caused the damage must be content with an approximation thereof, or, if that be impossible, bear the whole
loss (Hamilton Shoe Co. v. Wolf Bros., 240 U. S. 251),
applies only where the damages are "definitely attributable 'to the wrong "; it has no application to "such as are
not the certain result of the wrong." Story Parchment

for which the carrier was relieVed under § 3 of the Harter
Act. This Court has held that the improper use at sea of
permanent appliances almost identical with hatch and
ventilator covers, constituted a fault in management of
ship, not in care of cargo. The Silvia, 171 U. S. 462, 466.

aff'd, 196 U. S. 589.
In the light of the legislative history of the Harter Act,
it would appear that the care of cargo for which the
owner was to be held in all events, was care relating particularly to the three sorts of cargo-handling specifically
named in § 1, viz., " loading," " stowage" and " delivery "; and that such want of care as might occur.at sea
in the prosecution of the voyage and in th, actual. transporting of the cargo was not to be included. See May v.
Hamburg Gesellschaft, 290 U. S.333, 345-346.
.The distinction sought to be made by the Harter Act
in §§ 1 and 3 is a distinction between the owner management and servant managemefht. The question is " when
management begins and ends" rather than the question,
once the servants' management has begun and the ship
is plowing the seas, whether the want of care is in respect
to the cargo or the " transport" of the 6argo or the ship.

SCHNELL v. THE VALLESCURA.
296

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.

Petitioners brought suit in admiralty in the district
court for Southern New York, to recover damages for"
injury to a shipment of onions on respondent's S. S. "Vallescura" from Spain to New York City. The onions,
receipt of which in apparent good condition was acknowl.
edged by the bill of lading, were delivered in New York
damaged by decay. The vessel pleaded as a defense a-,
exception, in the bill of lading, from liability for damage
by" decay" and " perils of the seas," and that the damage
"was not due to any cause or event arising through any
negligence on the part of the vessel, her master, owner
or agents."
On the trial there was evidence that the decay was
caused by improper ventilation of the cargo during the
voyage, and that the failure to ventilate was due in part
to closing of the hatches and ventilators made necessary
by heavy weather, and in part to the neglect of the master
and crew in failing to keep them open at night in fair
weather. The district court entered an interlocutory decree, adjudging that the libellants recover the amount of
the damage sustained by them, caused by closing the
hatches and ventilators during good weather, and appointing a special commissioner to ascertain and compute
the amount of damage.
The commissioner, after hearing evidence, found that
it was impossible to ascertain how much of the damage
was due to want of ventilation in fair weather and how
much to want of it in bad. But, after comparing the periods during which the ventilators were negligently closed
with those during which they were open or properly
closed,1 he stated: "It would seem, therefore, that the
I The voyage lasted twenty-three days. The commissioner found
that during the voyage, day and night together, the hatches and
ventilators were kept open only 170 hours, that they were properly
closed 144 hours, and improperly closed for 238 hours.

293 U. S.

greater part of the damage ntust have been due to improper shutting of the hatches and ventilators." He concluded that as the vessel had ,failed to show what-part of
the damage was due to bad weather, the petitioner should
recover the full amount of the damage. The district
court, accepting the report of the commissioner as presumably correct, as required by Admiralty Rule No. 431/2,
286 U. S. 572, found no basis for rejecting its conclusions
and gave judgment to libellants accordingly. The Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, 70 F. (2d)
261, holding that as the damage was within the clause of
the bill of lading exempting the vessel from liability for
decay, the turden was on petitioner to show what part
of the damage was taken out of the exception, because
due to. respondent's negligence.
Although certiorari was granted to review this ruling of
the court below, most of respondent's argument before us
was given over to the contention that the record discloses no finding, by either court below, that any part
of the damage was caused by respondent's negligence.
The decision of the District Court was made before the
promulgation of Rule 461/ in Admiralty, 281 U. S. 773,
requiring the trial court to make special findings of fact.
No formal findings were made, but in directing entry of
the interlocutory decree, anid after.reviewing the evidence
and commenting on the fact that the hatches and ventilators had been kept dosed at night in fair weather, a
circumstance which the trial judge declared established
negligence in-the care and custody.of the cargo, he stated:
"Thus it appears that this notoriously perishable cargo
of Spanish Onions (The Buckleigh, 1929 A. M. C. 449,
450) was deprived of all ventilation during the nighttime,
regardless of the state of the weather. Such treatment
was obviously ruinous and must have caused substantial
damage." We have no doubt that this was intended to

SCHNELL v. THE VALLESCURA.
296

303

Opinion of the Court.

be a finding that negligence in failing to provide proper
ventilation was the cause of some of the damage and
that, as such, it was adequately supported by evidence.
The commissioner and the court below assumed it to be
such and we so accept it.
The failure to ventilate the cargo was not a "fault or
error in navigation or management " of the. vessel, from
the consequences of which it may be relieved by § 3 of
the Harter Act of February 13, 1893, § 3, c. 105, 27 Stat.
445; § 192, Tit. 46, U. S. C. The management was of
the cargo, within the meaning of §§ 1 and 2 of the Act,
and not of the vessel, to which § 3 relates. The Germanic,
196 U. S. 589, 597; Knott v. Botany Mills, 179 U. S. 69,
73, 74; The Jean Bart, 197 Fed. 1002, 1006 (D. C.).
Hence, we pass to the decisive question whether, in view
of the presumptions which aid the shipper in establishing the vessel's liability under a Contract for carriage by
sea, it was necessary for the petitioners to offer .further
evidence in order to recover the damage which they have
suffered. If, in the state of the proof which the record
exhibits, recovery depends upon their ability to produce
evidence which would enable the court to separate the
amount of damage attributable to respondent's negligence from that attributable to the unavoidable failure
to ventilate in bad weather, they have failed to do so and
judgment must go against them. But if respondent can
relieve itself from liability only by showing what part of
the damage was dub to sea peril, in that,bad weather prevented ventilation, judgment must go against it for the
full damages.
In general the burden rests upon the carrier of goods
by sea to bring himself within any exception relieving
him from the liability which the law otherwise imposes
on him. This is true at common law with respect to
the exceptions which the law itself annexed to his under-

304

Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

taking, such as his immunity from liability for act of
God or the public enemy. See Carver, Carriage by Sea
(7th ed.) Chap. I. The rule applies equally with respect
to other exceptions for which the law permits him to
stipulate. Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 280; Rich
v. Lambert, 12 How. 347, 357; The Propeller Niagara v.
Cordes, 21 How. 7, 29; The Maggie Hammond, 9 Wall.
435, 459; The Edwin I. Morrison, 153 U. S. 199. 211;
The Folmina, 212 U. S.354, 361. The reason for the rule
is apparent. He is a bailee entrusted with the shipper's
goods, with respect to the care and safe delivery of which
the law imposes upon him an extraordinary duty. Discharge of the duty is peculiarly within his control. All
the facts and circumstances upon which he may rely to
relieve him of that duty are peculiarly within his knowledge and usually unknown to the shipper. In consequence, the law casts upon him the burden of the loss
which he cannot explain or, explaining, bring within the
exceptional case in which he is relieved from liability.
See Bank of Kentucky v. Adams Express Co., 93 U. S.
174, 184; Chicago & Eastern Illinois R. Co. v. Collins
Produce Co., 249 U. S. 186, 192, 193; Railroad 'Co. v.
Lockwood, 17 Wall. 357, 379, 380.
To such exceptions the law itself annexes a condition
that they shall relieve the carrier from liability for loss
from an excepted cause only if in the course of the voyage
he has used due care to guard against it. Liverpool &
Great Western Steam Co. v. Phenix Insurance Co., 129
U. S. 397, 438; Compania de Navigacion La Flecha v.
Brauer, 168 U. S. 104, 117. This rule is recognized and
continued in the first. section of the Harter Act, which
makes it unlawful to insert any clause in a bill of lading
whereby the carrier shall be relieved of liability f6r
negligence.
It is commonly said that when the carrier succeeds in
establishing that the injury is from an excepted cause,

SCHNELL v. THE VAILESCURA.
296

Opinion of the Court.

the burden is then on the shipper to show that that cause
would not have produced the injury but for the carrier's
negligence in failing to guard against it. Such we may
assume the rule to be, at least to the extent of requiring
the shipper to give evidence of negligence where the carrier has sustained the burden of showing that the immediate cause of the loss or injury is an excepted peril.
Clark v. Barnwell, 12 How. 272, 280; Railroad Company
v. Reeves, 10 Wall. 176, 189, 190; Transportation Co. v.
Downer, 11 Wall. 129, 134; The Victory & The Plymothian, 168 U. S. 410. 423; Cau v. Texas & Pacific Ry.
Co., 194 U. S. 427, 432; The Malcolm Baxter, 277 U. S.
323, 334.
But this is plainly not the case where the efficient cause
of the injury for which the carrier is prima facie liable is
not shown to be an excepted peril. The Mohler, 21 Wall.
230, 234; The Edwin I. Morrison, supra, 211. If he delivers a cargo damaged by eauses unknown or unexplained,
which had been received in good condition, he is subject
to the rule applicable to all bailees, that such evidence
makes out a prima facie case of liability. It is sufficient,
if. the carrier fails to show that the damage is from an
excepted cause, to cast on him the further burden of
showing that the damage is not due to failure properly
to stow or care for the cargo during the voyage. Rich v.
Lambert,.supra,357 ,The Maggie Hammond, supra, 459;
The Folmina, 212 U. S,354, 361; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry.
Co. v. Thdmpson Mfg. Cb.4 270 U. S. 416, 422, 423.
Here the stipulation was for exemption from liability
for a particular kind of injury,--decay. But the decay of a
perishable cargo is not a cause; it is an effect. It may be
the result of a number of causes, for some of which, such
as the inherent defects of the cargo, or, under the contract,
sea peril making it impossible to ventilate properly, the
carrier is not liable. For others, such as negligent stowage, or failure to care for the cargo properly during the

OCTOBER TERM, 1934.
Opinion of the Court.

293 U. S.

voyage, he is liable. The stipulation thus did not add
to the causes of injury from which the carrier could claim
immunity. It could not relieve him from liability for
want of diligence in the stowage or care of the cargo.
It is unnecessary for us to consider whether the effect
of the clause is to relieve the carrier from the necessity,
in the first instance, of offering evidence of due diligence
in caring for a cargo received in good condition, and delivered in a state of decay. See The Hindoustan, 67 Fed.
794, 795 (C. C. A. 2d); The Patria, 132 Fed. 971, 972
(C. C. A. 2d); Loma Fruit Co. v. International Navigation Co., 11 F. (2d) 124, 125 (C. C. A. 2d);,The Gothic
Star, 4 F. Supp. 240, 241 (D. C.). For 'here want of diligence in providing proper venilation is established and it
is found that the failure to ventilate has caused the damage. It is enough that the clause plainly cannot be taken
to relieve the vessel from bringing itself within the exception from liability for damage by sea peril where the
shipper has carried the burden of showing that the decay
is due either to sea peril, in that bad weather prevented
ventilation, or to the vessel's negligence. Where the state
of the proof is such as to show that the damage is due
either to an excepted peril or to the carrier's negligent
care of the cargo, it is for him to bring himself within the
exception or to show that he has' not been negligent.
The Folmina,supra.
Similarly, the carrier must bear the entire loss where it
appears that the injury to cargo is due either to sea peril
or negligent stowage, or both, and he fails to show what
damage is attributable to sea peril. Corsar v. J. D.

Co., 33 F: (2d) 337 (D. C.). In each of these cases the
carrier is charged with the responsibility for a loss which,
in fact, may not be due to his fault, merely because the
law, in pursuance of a wise policy, casts on him the
burden of showing facts relieving him from liability.
The vessel in the present case is in no better position
because, upon the evidence, it appears that some of the
damage, in an amount not ascertainable, is due to sea
peril. That does not remove the burden of showing facts
relieving it from liability. If it remains liable for the
whole amount of the damage because it is unable to show
that sea peril was a cause of the loss, it must equally remain so if it cannot show what part of the loss is due to
that cause. Speyer v. The Mary Belle Roberts, supra;
