CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.
No. 289.

Argued December 7, 1934.-Decided January 7, 1935.

1. In review by certiorari the Court is not called upon to consider
any question not raised by the petition for the writ. P. 511.
2. Where a taxpayer shows before the Board of Tax Appeals that a

tax is arbitrarily assessed and excessive, his relief from payment
of it is not conditional upon his showing also the correct amount
of tax or that none was assessable. Section 274 (e), Revenue
Act of 1926, and §§ 51 (a) and 54 (a), Revenue Act of 1928,
considered. P. 512.
3. The evidence before the Board of Tax Appeals showed that a
tax on income derived from sale of preferred stock which had been
acquired at the same time as common stock of the same corporaCf. United States v. Pollock, 68 F. (2d) 633, 634. United States

CERTIORARI * to review a judgment reversing a decision
of the Board of Tax App als, which sustained a deficiency
income tax assessment.
Assistant Attorney General Wideman, with whom
So!icitor General Biggs and Mr. Sewall Key was on the.
brief, for petitioner.
Mr. Truman Henson for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.
The commissioner determined a deficiency of $9,156.69
on account of respondent's 1928 income tax., The Board
of Tax Appeals made the same determination. The.
court held it excessive and that the evidence did not show
the correct amount, reversed the order of the board, and
remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance
with the opinion. 70 F. (2d) 619. The petition for our
writ states the question: "Whether the Circuit Court of
Appeals erred in remanding this case to the Board of Tax
Appeals for a new hearing on the ground that- the Commissioner's ditermination of the amount of income was
incorrect, Ilthough the taxpayer had failed to prove facts
from which a correct determination could be made."
In August, 1927, respondent acquired all the stock of
four utilities at a total cost of $96,030, organized a holding company and, October 13, transferred to it all the

utilities stock and received therefor all the shares of the
holding company: 1.000 of preferred having no par value,
entitled to a dividend of $6 annually, $100 on liquidation
and callable at $105 per share; 2,500 of no par value
class A common callable at $35 per share; 5,000 of no
par value class B common stock having the voting power.
As this transaction was " reorganization" under Revenue Act of 1926, § 203 (b) (2), 44 Stat. 12, notaxable
gain resulted.
In May, 1928, the holding company sold the stock of
the four utilities to the Colonial corporation for $194,930.16. Later in that year the holding company bought
or retired all the preferreZl and paid the taxpayer $99,000
therefor. In his 1928 return he assigned the $96,030 for
which he procured the utilities to the preferred stock of
the holding company, deducted that amount from-the
$99,000 received therefor, and reported the difference,
$2,970, as the gain derived from the sale. The applicable
statutory provisions are contained in Revenue Act of 1928.

§§ 11 (a) (d),. 112 (b) (3), 113 (a) (6). 45 Stat. 815-19.1

'"Sec. 111. (a) Except as hereinafter provided in this section, the
gain from the sale or other disposition of property shall be the excess
of the amount realized therefrom over the basis provided in section
113, and the loss shall be the excess of such basis over the amount
realized ...
"(d) In the case of a sale or exchange, the extent to which the
gain or loss determined under this section shall be recognized for the
purposes of this title, shall be determined under the provisions of
section 112.
"Sec. 112. (b) (3) No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or
securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, exchanged solely for stock or
securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to
the reorganization.
"Sec. 113. (a) The basis for determining the gain or loss from the
sale or other disposition of property acquired after February 28, 1913,
shall be the cost of such property; except that . . .
"(6) If the property was acquired upon an exchange described in
section 112 (b) to (e), inclusive, the basis shall be the same as in

They prescribe no rule that is applicable for the ascertainment of the cost of the preferred stock or the apportionment of the total cost between preferred and common.
But Regulations 74, Art. 58, declares: "Where common
stock is received as a bonus with the purchase of preferred
stock or bonds, the total purchase price shall be fairly
apportioned between such common stock and the securities purchased for the purpose of determining the portion of the cost attributable to each class of stock or securities, but if that should be impracticable in any case, no
profit on any subsequent sale of any part of the stock or
securities will be realized until out of the proceeds of sales
shall have been recoyered the total cost."
The Commissioner, holding the 'taxpayer not entitled
to charge the cost of all to the preferred, apportioned betwpen the preferred and common. He made his calculation upon the assumption that the cost, in 1927, attributable to the preferred shares bears the same relation to
cost of all the shares then acquired as the amount respondent received, in 1928, for the preferred bears to the
amount paid the holding company by Colonial corporation
for all the utilities shareg.2 On that basis, he found that
of the total 1927 cost, $96,030, there was chargeable to
the preferred only $48,771.16 which deducted from $99,000
received by respondent. for the preferred in 1928, leaves
$50,228.84 upon which he determined the deficiency of
$9,156.69.

money received by the.taxpayer and increased in the amount of gain
or decreased in the amount of loss td the taxpayer that was recognized upon such exchange under the law applicable to the year in
which the exchange was made." 45 Stat. 815-819.
'The figures are: X :$96,030 : : $99,000 : $194,930.17. The calculation stated in the opinion of the Board of Tax Appeals is:

$99,000.00

HELVERING v. TAYLOR..
507

Opinion of the Court.

Before the Boardo of Tax Appeals the taxpayer introduced evidence to show the details of the transaction and
that there was no change in value of the utilities stock between the time he got it in August, 1927, and the date,
October 13 of the same year, on which he transferred it
to the holding company in exchange for its shares and
that the entire increase in value came after that transfer.
No opposing'evidence was offered. On .the facts shown,
the taxpayer maintained that, as total cost was less than
$100 per share for the preferred having prior rights to that
extent on liquidation, the common stock had no value.
Rejecting that contention, the Board of Tax Appeals filed
a memorandum opinion in which it said: " It may. well be
that the properties acquired or all the classes of stocks
received by the petitioner were worth only $96,030...
and yet the preferred stock . . . may have had the value
of $48,771.16 . . . It is obvious that even if all the securities were, worth only $96,030 that the proportionate
value of the preferred stock to all the stocks would not
necessarily be different from that determined by the Commissioner. . . . The question . . . is one of fact to
be determined by testimony and not theory. It is conceivable that common stocks may actually sell On the market when preferred stocks in the same corporation are
selling at less than par." It was upon that basis without
specific findings of fact, that the board made the redeter-mination at the figure set by the commissioner.
The only question for consideration is that stated in
the petition for the writ of certiorari. Gunning v. Cooley,
281 U. S. 90, 98. That question in effect assumes, and
here it is taken as granted, that the court rightly held the
evidence sufficient to require a findiiig that the commissioner's apportionment of total cost as between preferred
and common stock was unfair and erroneous and that
therefore the commissioner's determination was exces-

sive. We also assume that the total purchase price is
susceptible of fair apportionment.and that upon anQther
hearing. the correct .amount may be found. 70 F. (2d)
619, 620. Regulations 74, Art. 58, supra. The point to
be considered is whether, the taxpayer having failed to
establish the correct amount to be assigned to the preferred stock as its cost to him, the court erred in reversing and remanding for further proceedings in accordance
with its opinion.
The commissioner does not contend that, in cases where
Circuit 'Courts of Appeals properly reverse determinations of the board, they are without power to remand for
further hearing in the nature of a new trial.' His contention is that in this case the -burden on the taxpayer
was not only to prove that the commissioner's determination is erroneous but to show the correct amount of the
tax. In substance he says that, because of the taxpayer's
failure to estabfish facts'on which a fair apportionment
may be made, the board's redetermination at the commissioner's erroneous figure was valid, and there being
no error of law, sh6uld have been sustained by the court.
And he maintains that, in the absence of error on the
part of the board, the court was without power to remand
for further hearing.
He cites Revenue Act of 1926, §.274 (e), 44 Stat. 56:
"The Board shall have ju risdiction to redetermine the
correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so
redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency,
§ 1003 (b), Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 110, 26 U. S. C. Supp. "
VII, § 641 (c) (1) provides: " Upon such review, such courts shall
have power to affirm or, if the decision of the Board is not in accordance with law, to modify or. to reverse the decision of the Board,

with or without remanding the case for a rehearing, as justice may
require."

HEIVERING v. TAYLOR.

Opinion of the Court.

notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, and to
determine whether any penalty, additional amount or
addition to the tax should be assessed, if claim therefor is
asserted by the Commissioner at or before the hearing or
a rehearing." The purpose of that provision is to define
the jurisdiction granted to the board; it does not prescribe any rule of evidence or burden of proof. Plainly
it does not support the commissioner's contention that
the taxpayer,' even though he has shown the determination to be arbitrary and excessive, must nevertheless pay
the added tax because he has not also shown that he owes
nothing or the correct amount, if any, that legally may
be laid upon him.
He also cites Revenue Act of 1928, §§ 51 (a) and 54
(a). 45 Stat. 807, 808. Neither givesany support to his
contention. The first requires the taxpayer to nmke
under oath a return stating specifically the amount of
his gross income and the amounts of deductions and
credits allowed. The other requires the taxpayer to keep
such records, render under oath such statements, make
such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations
as the commissioner may prescribe. These requirements
give no support to the'commissioner's contention. They
tend rather to suggest that taxpayer's returns are correct
and may not arbitrarily be set at naught.
He also cites Rule 30 adopted by the board: " The
burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except as
otherwise provided by statute and except-that in respect
of any new matter pleaded in his answer, it shall be 'upon
the respondent." But there is nothing in it to suggest
intention to require the taxpayer to prove not only that
a deficiency assessment laid upon him was arbitrary and
wrong but also to show the correct amount. Moreover,
the board held the evidence not sufficient to show the

apportionment erroneous and on that ground alone sustained the assessment. Necessarily the board did, not
come to the question that is here presented as to burden
of proof. The fact that the commissioner's determination of a deficiency was arbitrarily made may reasonably
be deemed sufficient to require the board to set it aside.
Cf. Bruce & Human Drug Co., 1 B. T. A. 342. Acorn
Refining Co., 2 B. T. A. 253. Index 1otion Co., 3 B. T. A.
90.
The commissioner cites United States v. Rindskopf, 105
U. S. 418;, United States v. Anderson, 269 U. S. 422, 443;
Reinecke v. Spalding, 280 U. S. 227, 232-233. The first
of these may be put aside without discussion as having
no bearing upon the point here in controversy. The other
two were' adequately distinguished by the Circuit Court
of Appeals. Each was an action to recover taxes paid.
Obviously the burden was on the plaintiff, in order to
establish a basis for judgment in his favor, specifically
to show not merely that the assessment was erroneous
but also the amount to which he was entitled. For
like reason the,burden is upon the taxpayer to establish
the amount of a deduction claimed. Burnet v. Houston,
283 U. S. 223, 227. Helvering v. Independent Life Ins.
Co., 292 U. S. 371, 381. New Colonial Co. v. Helvering,
292 U. S. 435, 440.
We find nothing in the statutes, the rules of the board
or..our decisions that gives any support to the idea that
the commissioner's determination, shown to be without
rational foundation and excessive, will be enforced unless
the taxpayer proves he owes nothing or, if liable at all,
shows the correct amount. While decisions of the lower
courts may not be harmonious, our attention has not

been called to any that persuasively supports the rule
for which the commissioner here contends.4
Unquestionably the burden of proof is on the taxpayer
to show that the commissioner's determination is invalid.
Lucas v. Structural Steel Co., 281 U. S. 264, 271. Wickwire v. Reinecke, 275 U. S. 101, 105. Welch v. Helvering,
290 U. S. 111, 115. Frequently, if not quite generally,
evidence adequate to overthrow the commissioner's finding is also sufficient to show the correct amount, if any,
that is due. See, e. g., Darcy v. Commissioner, 66 F. (2d)
581, 585. But, where as in this case the taxpayer's evidence shows the commissioner's determination to be arbitrary and excessive, it may not reasonably be held that'
he is bound to pay a tax that confessedly he does not owe,
unless his evidence was ufficient also to establish the
correct amount that lawfully might be charged against
him. On the facts shown by the taxpayer in this case, the
board should have held the apportionment arbitrary and
the commissioner's determination invalid. Then, upon

should have heard evidence to,show whether a fair apportionment might be made and, if so, the correct amount

Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE STONE,

dissenting.

I think the judgment should be reversed.
-As respondent failed to establish any amount by which
the deficiency fixed by the Commissioner should be reduced, the Board of Tax Appeals was without authority,
under the statute defining its jurisdiction, to disturb the
determinationof the Commissioner, c. 27, §§ 274 (b) (e),
906 (c) (d), 44 Stat. 9, 55, 56, 107; 26 U. S. C., §§ 1048a,
1048c, 1217 (c) (d). If, under § 906 (d), it wa's the duty
of the Board to dismiss the petition and enter on its.records a finding that it could not determine the amount of
the deficiency, these requirements are formal only. Its
failure to comply with them does iot require a reversal
of its order sustaining the action of the Commissioner or
in any case afford ground for decision on appeal that the
Board should have held the Commissioner's determination invalid or that it should now take further evidence.
