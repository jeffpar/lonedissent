the power to improve navigation. Held, that there was no ground
for implying a promise to compensate the owner; that his cause of
action, if any, was in tort; and that an action by him against the

THE case is stated in the opinion.
Mr. Thomas B. Lantry, with Whom Mr. Timothy F.
Mullen wasgon the briefs, for plaintiff in error:
A riparian owner may maintain his bank in its original..
condition, or restore it.
Prescription seems to be the test of determining whether
the owner loses his right to compensation.
The public has no proprietorship in soil under small
streams which are navigable only in a modified sense, for
the floatage of logs and lumber, as it has under navigable
waters at common law, where the tide ebbs and flows.
The statute of limitations does not run against the landowner's action for a taking until the work ha's been Completed.
Land is not taken,-in the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, until compensation is paid and the title passes from
the owner. The filing of the petition for compensation is
an acceptance of the taking, and the right of action accrues upon such acceptance.
The right of the public to improve the navigability of a
stream without compensation is confined to the natural
bed.
The commencement of a suit for damages is the acceptance of ihe taking of the property held for public use.
In this, case it is not questioned that the 4itle was in the
plaintiff, and that the Governinent had taken his prop-

The Solicitor General for the United States:
The Chicago River being a navigable stream in its
natural state, therewas no taking, because the submerged
lands were subject to the paramount right of the Government to improve navigation.
In improving navigation the Government was not confined to the channel shown by the survey of 1837, but
might dredge any portion of the river bed.
Such injury, if any, as claimant has suffered in this case
was occasioned by the act of his lessee, and the remedy is
in an action against him.
The District Court correctly held that it was without
jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, because the suit was
instituted more than six years after the alleged right of
action accrued.

floating of logs. The United States surveyed the river
in 1837, but made no improvement above its mouth until
1896. Before the latter date, however, extensive improvements had been made from thne to time by the city and
by riparian owners. The river had become the inner
harbor of Chicago and, measured by its tonnage, was one
of the most important waterways of the globe. In number
of arrivals and departures of vessels it led all the harbors
of the United States. In tonnage it was second only to
New York.1
In 1896 Congress made an appropriation "Fior inproving the Chicago River, in Illinois, from its mouth to the
stock yards on the South Branch and to Belmont avenue
on the North Branch, as far as may be permitted by
existing docks and wharves, to be dredged to admit
passage by vessels drawing sixteen feet of water." Act of
June 3, 1896, c. 314, 29 Stat. 202, 228. This act was
amended by the Act of June 4, 1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 11, 47,
which, as interpreted by the War Department, permitted
a slight widening of the stream in certain places. The
General Assembly of Illinois by resolution of April 22-23,
1897, [Laws, 1897, p. 3081 gave assent to the United
States' acquiring by purchase or condemnation "all lands
necessary tor widening the Chicago river and-its branches."
In 1899 Congress directed a survey with a view to creating
a deeper channel and adopting 21 feet "as the project
depth for the improvement in lieu of that fixed by the
Act of June third, eighteen hundred and ninety-six."
Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425, 30 Stat. 1121, 1156. No
widening beyond the banks of the de jure stream was
specifically authorized by this act, nor by any subsequent
act. From time to time other appropriations were made
by Congress for these improvements of the river, and work

was carried on thereunder.1 About 12.5 miles of the
river was improved by the Government; and of this
about 5 miles consisted of that part of the North Branch
which lies between the main river and Belmont Avenue.
Early in 1889 Tempel became the owner of certain land
on the bank of the North Branch below Belmont Avenue.
He leased his land for a brick yard; and by the terms of
the lease the lessee was permitted to dredge the biottom
of the river in front of the premises for the purpose of
making brick from the clay thereunder. But the lessee
was directed not to interfere with the upland; and he
covenanted to deliver up the premises in the condition

in which they were demised. Nevertheless, from time
to time during a ieriod of five years between 1889 and
1899, the lessee dug away, to a depth of from 6 to 14 feet,
a large strip of the upland, extending in some places to
a considerable width. In its natural state the stream
opposite the plaintiff's property varied in width from
probably fifty to a hundred and fifty feet, and could be
used only for floating logs and for travel by row boats
or canoes; but before 1889 riparian owners had dug a
channel and possibly greatly widened the stream; and
schooners navigated to a point beyond Belmont Avenue.
Between 1890 and 1899 boats drawing 5 to 8 feet of
water were navigating the North Branch up to Belmont
Avenue.

In 1896 the river in front of Tempel's property

was in varying depths of from 6 to 14 or 15 feet.
The United States did not do any dredging in front of

Tempel's property until 1899. Then it dredged a channel
to the depth of 17 feet, about 30 feet wide--the excavation
being made wholly in the then bed of the stream as submerged. Its next dredging there was in 1909, when this
channel was deepened to 21 feet and widened to 60 feet,
the excavation being again made wholly in the then bed
of the stream as submerged. All of the dredging, both
in 1899 and in 1909, which was not within the bed of the
river in its natural state, was done within the limits of
the strip of upland which had been submerged through
the dredging done by, the lessee prior to 1899. During
the period from 1889 to 1899, the stream in front of
Tempel's premises was in constant and increasing use
for the purpose of public navigation. The Government
does not appear to have had knowledge of the fact that
dredging had been done before 1899 by the lessee without
the consent of Tempel or that the river had been widened
by excavation. The reports of the Secretary of War show
that he never specifically authorized, for the purpose of
widening the river, the appropriation of any of the property herein involved and that the Government' believed,
when it dredged in front of Tempel's property in 1899"
and again in 1909, that the submerged land, in which
the dredging was done, was either a part of the natural
bed of the river, or that it had been dedicated by the
owner for purposes of navigation, or that it had in some
other manner become a part of the de jure stream.' No

show that, in the dredging under the project of 1896, the effort had
been to secure title to all property necessary for the proposed development and that it was believed that (with exceptions not here material)
this had been done. The property here involved was not included in
the land which it was proposed to acquire. The reports also show that

objection-was made by Tempel, until 1910, to the use,
for navigation, of the river in front of his property; and
he did not file any complaint as to the dredging of 1899.
He had no knowledge, until 1910, of the dredging which
had been done by his lessee, nor of that done by the
Government.
Promptly after learning of the dredging, Tempel demanded of the Government possession of that part of the
land submerged which had formerly constituted a part
of his upland. The demand was refused; and in 1911 he
brought, in the District Court of the United States for
the Northern District of Illinois, this suit, under the
Tucker Act (Judicial Code, ยง 24, par. 20), to recover the
value of property which he claimed had been taken by
the Government. The complaint alleged that the river
in front of his premises was, at the time he acquired the
same. and theretofore, a creek used only for surface drainage and was "hot a navigable stream either in law or in
fact"; that the Government "in the latter part of the
year 1909 completely excavated a channel through the
same" for the purpose of making said North Branch
navigable; and that it holds possession thereof by virtue
of the, resolution of the General Assembly of Illinois above
referred to; and that the reasonable value of the property
taken was $10,000. The complaint did not refer either
to the dredging done before 1889, when Tempel acquired
the property, or to that done between 1889 and 1899 by
Tempel's lessee, or to that done in 1899 by the Government. The answer denied that the stream in front of
accounting of the division of funds between different objeets none
were assigned to the securing of land for widening the river. Reports,

for 1913, p. 1119; for 1914, pp. 1157-1160. Nowhere does it appear
that the Secretary of War ever authorized the taking of the property
involved in this suit.

OCTOBER TERMII, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

248 U. S.

Tempel's land was non-navigable when he purchased it
or theretofore; asserted that all excavations by the Govermnent were made in the center of the stream and were
for the purpose of improving navigation; and denied that
it had taken any of Tempel's property under the resolution of the Illinois Assembly or otherwise.
The trial court found as a fact, "That by reason of the
changes in said river as aforesaid, the difference between
the value of the premises of the petitioner at the time
when he purchased the same as aforesaid, and the value
of the same at the time that the demand as hereinbefore
set forth was made, less the cost of reclaiming the same,
were he entitled to make reclamation thereof, is $7,547.00."
As conclusions of law the trial court found that the North
Branch was navigable in its natural state; that it was
navigable in fact as early as 1889; that Tempel, having
failed to complain of the use by the public of the stream
in front of his property for a period of at least ten years
prior to the first dredging by the United States, was
estopped from thereafter disputing the navigability of the
river; and that the river being then a navigable stream, the
dredging of the bed in 1899 and in 1909 did not constitute
a, taking of Tempel's property within the meaning of the
Fifth Amendment. Judgment was entered for the United
States; and the case comes here on writ of error.
First. This is a suit, like United States v. Lynah, 188
U. S. 445, and United States v. Cress, 243 U. S. 316, to
recover the value of property taken by the Government
in making a river improvement. The property alleged
to have been taken is land, part of which lies within the
30-foot channel first dredged by the Government in 1899;
the balance within the additional 30 feet dredged by it
in 1909, when the channel was widened to 60 feet; and
all of which formed part of the river bed and was submerged when the Government commenced its improvement and has been since. But the property of Tempel,

TEMPEL v. UNITED STATES.
121.

Opinion.of the Court.

if any, which the Government has taken, is only the right
to keep his land submerged, to navigate over it, and to
improve it further for purposes of navigation. This right
in the land the Government claimed and claims that it
already possessed at the time when it dredged on the
property in question; and it is the same right which the
Government possesses in that portion of the present river
bed lying within the original meander lines and which
originally constituted the whole river bed. Under the
law of Illinois, neither the United States nor the State
owns the lands under a navigable river. Riparian owners
own the fee to the middle of the stream, St. Louis v. Rutz,
138 U. S. 226, 242; subject to the paramount right of
the Government to use the same and to make improvements therein for purposes of navigation, without the
payment of compensation, West Chicago Street R. R. Co.
v. Chicago, 201 U. S. 506, 520; United States v. ChandlerDunbar Co., 229 U. S. 53, 62; Willink v. United States,
240 U. S. 572, 580. Included in such permissible improvement is dredging for the purpose of deepening the channel,
Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs, 229 U. S. 82. It is
only this right to use and improve for purposes of navigation that the Government claims here, a right which the
Government undoubtedly possessed, if the land in question had been a part of the bed of the de jure stream, as
was supposed.
If the plaintiff can recover, it must be upon an implied
contract. For, under the Tucker Act, the consent of the
United States to be sued is (so far as here material) limited
to claims founded "upon any contract, express or implied' ; and a remedy for claims sounding in tort is expressly denied. Bigby v. United States, 188 U. S. 400;
Hijo v. United States, 194 U. S. 315, 323. As stated in
United States v. Lynah, 188 U. S. 445, 462, 465: "The law
will imply a promise to make the required compensation,
where property to which the government a4sserts no title,

is taken, pursuant to an act of Congress, as private property to be' applied for public uses"; or in other words:
"Whenever in the exercise of its governmental rights it
takes property, the ownership of which it concedes to be
in an individual, it impliedly promises to pay therefor."
But in the case at bar, both the pleadings and the facts,
found preclude the implication of a promise to pay. For
the property applied to the public use is not and was not
conceded to be in the plaintiff.
Second. The answer, specifically denying that the
United States has taken plaintiff's land, excavated a
channel through it, and claims possession thereof under
the resolution of the Illinois Assembly or otherwise,
asserts that in 1909 it did "excavate a channel in the
Chicago river in the center of the stream and now claims
possession thereof for the purpose of making more navigable the north branch." The findings of fact made by
the trial court (amplified by the reports of the Secretary
of War, of which we take judicial notice) show that the
Government claimed at the time of the alleged taking
and now claims that it already possessed, when it made
its excavation in 1909, the property right actually in
question. It is unnecessary to determine whether this
claim of the Government is well-founded. The mere
fact' that the Government then claimed and now claims
title in itself and that it denies title in the plaintiff, prevents the court from assuming jurisdiction of the controversy. The law cannot imply a promise by the Government to pay for a right over, or interest in, land, which
right or interest the Government ,claimed and claims it
possessed before it utilized the same. If the Government's claim is unfounded, a property right of plaintiff
was violated; but the cause of action therefor, if any, is
one sounding in tort; and for such, the Tucker Act affords
n6 remedy. Hill v. United States, 149 U. S. 593, which
both, in its pleadings and its facts bears a strong resem-

'TEMPEL v. UNITED STATES.
121.

Opinion of the Court.

blance to the case at bar, is conclusive on this point.
See also Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163. The
case at bar is entirely unlike both the Lynah Case and the
Cress Case. In neither of those cases does it appear that,
at the time of taking, there was any claim by the Government of a right to invade the property in question without
the payment of compensation. Under such circumstances
it must be assumed that the Government intended to
take and to make compensation for any property taken,
so as to afford the basis for an implied promise. And
when the implied promise to pay has once arisen, a later
denial by the Government (whether at the time of suit
or otherwise) of its liability to make compensation does
not destroy the right in contract and convert the act into
a tort. In both of those cases the facts required the implication of a promise to pay. But here the Governnient has contended since the beginning of the improvement that, at the time of the dredging in 1899 and in
1909, it possessed the right of navigation over the land
in question; which right of navigation, if it existed, gave
it the right to dredge further in order to improve navigation. The facts preclude implying a promise to pay.
If the Government is wrong in its contention, it has committed a tort. The United States has not conferred upon
the District Court jurisdiction to determine such a controversy. See Cramp & Sons v. Curtis Turbine Cb., 246
U. S. 28, 40-41.
The District Court, instead of rendering judgment for
the United States, should have dismissed the suit for want
of jurisdiction.
Judgment reversed and case remanded to the DistrictCourt
with directions to dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.

eration and decision of this case.)
