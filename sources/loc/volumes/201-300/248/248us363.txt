Syllabus.

Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, 226 U. S. 491; Boston
& Maine Railroad v. Hooker, 233 U. S. 97; that it was the
intention of Congress to deal with the whole subject;
and that the rights of plaintiff in respect to personal injuries is governed by the federal law. But the Carmack
Amendment deals only with the shipment of property.
Its language is so clear as to leave no ground for the contention that Congress intended to deal with the transportation of persons. Furthermore, plaintiff was not even
a passenger on the railway. His claim rests not upon a
contract of carriage, but upon the general right of a human
being not to be injured by the negligence of another.
Compare Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, 227 U. S. 601,
613. The case presents io substantial federal question.
The writ of error is
Dismissed.

MISSOURI, KANSAS & TEXAS RAILWAY COMPANY v. SEALY ET AL., PARTNERS AS HUTCHINGS, SEALY & COMPANY.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF KANSAS.
No. 90. Argued December 18, 1918.-Decided January 7, 1919.
When a party neglects to present a federal question within the time allowed by the state procedure, and it is refused consideration by the
state court for that reason, writ of error will not lie under Jud. Code,
ยง 237.
A cause of action under an interstate bill of lading, which arose, if at
all, before the date of the Carmack Amendment, depends upon the
state law.
Writ of error to review 98 Kansas, 225, dismissed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1918.
Opinion of the Court.

248 U. S.

Mr. Joseph M. Bryson, for plaintiff in error, submitted.
Mr. W. W. Brown and Mr. James W. Reid were also on
the brief.
Mr. Maurice H. Winger, with whom Mr. F. M. Harris,
Mr. Arthur Miller and Mr. Samuel J. McCulloch were on
the brief, for defendants in error
MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
court.
In June, 1900, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway
Company issued bills of lading to shipper's order covering
27 carloads of grain to be shipped from Kansas City,
Missouri, to Galveston, Texas. No grain was in fact delivered to it for shipment; but before the fraud was discovered, the alleged shipper transferred the bills of lading
to Hutchings, Sealy & Co., who made advances thereon.
The advances were not fully repaid; and in 1905 they
brought suit against the railroad in a state district court
of Kansas. The railroad defended on the ground that,
since the bills of lading had been delivered in Missouri,
the transaction was governed by the Missouri law, and
that under the law of that State the railroad was not
liable. For more than eight years the record contained
no suggestion of a federal question, the case having
meanwhile been passed upon twice by the Supreme Court
of Kansas (Railway Co. v. Hutchings, 78 Kansas, 758;
Hutchings v. Railway Co., 84 Kansas, 479). Thereafter,
in 1913, the railroad presented the claim that the transaction was governed by the federal law; and that, by it,
the defendant was not liable. The Supreme Court of
Kansas, apparently as a matter of state practice, declared
that the contention came too late to be considered; and
entered judgment for the plaintiff. 98 Kansas, 225. The
case comes here on writ of error under ยง 237 of the Judicial Code.

MERCHANTS EXCHANGE v. MISSOURI.
363.

Syllabus.

The federal question was not seasonably raised. Bonner
v. Gorman, 213 U. S. 86, 91; Louisville & Nashville R. R.
Co. v. Woodford, 234 U. S. 46, 51. But it is also unsubstantial. Prior to the Carmack Amendment (Act of
June 29, 1906, c. 3591, ยง 7, 34 Stat. 584, 595) the rights of
the parties were governed by state law, Boston & Maine
Railroad v. Hooker, 233 U. S. 97, 109-110; Pennsylvania
R. R. Co. v. Hughes, 191 U. S. 477; Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. PaulRy. Co. v. Solan, 169 U. S. 133; and the Carmack
Amendment does not apply, as the cause of action, if any,
arose six years before the passage of that act. The writ of
error is
Dismissed.

MERCHANTS EXCHANGE OF ST. LOUIS v. STATE
OF MISSOURI AT THE RELATION OF BARKER,
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

No. 116. Argued December 19, 1918.-Decided January 7, 1919.
A state law forbade, under penalties, any person, corporation, or association, other than a duly authorized and bonded state weigher,
to issue any weight certificate for grain weighed at any warehouse
or elevator where state weighers were stationed, or to charge for
such weighing or certificates. Held: (1) consistent with the duc
process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment
as applied to a local corporation, having the usual powers of a board
of trade, which weighed grain and issued weight certificates, for a
charge, at the request of its members; (2) not a burden on interstate
commerce as applied to grain received from or shipped to points
without the State; (3) not superseded by or in conflict with the
Federal Grain Standards Act (August 11, 1916, c. 313, 39 Stat. 482,
Part B). Pp. 367-369.
269 Missouri, 346, affirmed.
