seems to be no sufficient reason why the writ of error

THE HEBE COMPANY ET AL. v. SHAW, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE OF OHIO, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO.
No. 664.

Argued December 11, 12, 1918.-Decided January 7, 1919.

The General Code of Ohio, § 12725, forbids, under criminal penalty,
the manufacture, sale, etc., of condensed milk, unless made from
unadulterated milk from which the cream has not been removed and
in which the milk solids are equivalent to 12% of those in crude milk
and 25% of them fat, and unless the container is distinctly labeled,
stamped or marked with its true name, brand and by whom and
under what name made; by § 5778 a food is adulterated if a valuable
ingredient has been wholly or in part abstracted; and § 12720 allows skimmed milk to be sold only under restrictions. Appellants'
product, assumed to be wholesome and nutritious, and consisting
of condensed skimmed milk combined with cocoanut oil, was imported from another State in cases each containing a number of the
one pound or six ounce cans in which it was retailed, each can being
labeled "Hebe A Compound of Evaporated Skimmed Milk and
Vegetable Fat Contains 6% Vegetable Fat, 24% Total Solids,"
with the place of manufacture and address of the company, and the
words "For Coffee and Cereals For Baking and Cooking."
Held: (1) That the product was within the prohibition of § 12725.
P. 302.
(2) That, as so construed and applied, the statute did not violate the
Fourteenth Amendment. P. 303.
(3) That, as applied to the cans containing the product, the prohibition

of local sale was not invalid as a direct burden on interstate commerce; in this aspect the cases in which the cans were shipped, and
not the cans, were the "original packages." P. 304.

The bill of complaint should be dismissed for want of
equity.
MR. JUSTICE

HOLI-ES delivered the opinion of the court.

This is a bill in equity brought to restrain prosecutions
threatened against the plaintiffs and their customers for
selling a food product of the plaintiffs called Hebe, the
bill being based upon the destruction of the plaintiffs'
business which it is alleged will ensue. The prosecutions
are threatened mainly or wholly under certain statutes
of Ohio which, the plaintiffs argue, do not bear the construction put upon them by the defendants, or, if they
do, are bad under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the Commerce Clause.
Article I, § 8. A similar case was heard before three
judges. By agreement the evidence in that case was made
the evidence in this. The District Judge adopted the
opinion of the three and dismissed the bill.
Hebe is skimmed milk condensed by evaporation to
which six per cent. of cocoanut oil is added by a process
that combines the two. It is sold in tin cans containing

Opinion of the Court.

248 U. S.

one pound or six ounces of the product and ,labeled
"Hebe A Compound of Evaporated Skimmed Milk and
Vegetable Fat Contains 6% Vegetable Fat, 24% Total
Solids," with the place of manufacture and address of
the Hebe Company. On the side of the label are the
words "For Coffee and Cereals For Baking and Cooking."
By § 12725 of the General Code of Ohio "Whoever manufactures, sells, exchanges, exposes or offers for sale or
exchange, condensed milk unless it has been made from
. . . unadulterated . . . milk, from which the
cream has not been removed and in which the proportion
of milk solids shall be the equivalent of twelve per cent.
of milk solids in crude milk, twenty-five per cent. of such
solids being fat, and unless the package, can or vessel
containing it is distinctly labeled, stamped or marked with
its true name, brand, and by whom and under what name
made," is subject to a fine, and for each subsequent offense to a fine and imprisonment. The first question is
whether Hebe falls within these words.
It is argued that, as Hebe is a wholesome or not unwholesome product, the statutes should not be construed
to prohibit it if such a construction can be avoided, and
that it can be avoided by confining the prohibition to sales
of condensed milk as such, under the name of condensed
milk, as was held with regard to ice cream in Hutchinson
Ice Cream Co. v. Iowa, 242 U. S. 153. But the statute
could not direct itself to the product as distinguished from
the name more clearly than it does. You are not to make a
certain article, whatever you call it, except from certain
materials-the object plainly being to secure the presence
of the nutritious elements mentioned in the act, and to
save the public from the fraudulent substitution of an
inferior product that would be hard to detect. Savage
v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501, 524. By § 5778 a food is adulterated if a valuable ingredient has been wholly or in part
abstracted from it, and the effect of this provision upon

HEBE CO. v. SHAW.
297.

Opinion of the Court.

skimmed milk is qualified only by § 12720, which states
the stringent terms upon which alone that substance can
be sold. It seems entirely clear that condensed skimmed
milk is forbidden out and out. But if so the statute cannot be avoided by adding a small amount of cocoanut
ofl. We may assume that the product is improved by the
addition, but the body of it still is condensed skimmed
milk, and this improvement consists merely in making
the cheaper and forbidden substance more like the dearer
and better one and thus at the same time more available
for a fraudulent substitute. It is true that so far as the
question of fraud is concerned the label on the plaintiffs'
cans tells the truth-but the consumer in many cases
never sees it. Moreover, when the label tells the public
to use Hebe for purposes to which condensed milk is
applied and states of what Hebe is made, it more than
half recognizes the plain fact that Hebe is nothing but
condensed milk of a cheaper sort.
We are satisfied that the statute as construed by us is
not invalidated by the Fourteenth Amendment. The
purposes to secure a certain minimum of nutritive elements and to prevent fraud may be carried out in this way
even though condensed skimmed milk and Hebe both
should be admitted to be wholesome. The power of the
legislature "is not to be denied simply because some innocent articles or transactions may be found within the
proscribed class. The inquiry must be whether, considering the end in view, the statute passes the bounds of
reason and assumes the, character of a merely arbitrary
fiat." Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S.
192, 204. If the character or effect of the article as intended to be used "be debatable, the legislature is entitled to its own judgment, and that judgment is not to
be superseded by the verdict of a jury," or we may add,
by the personal opinion of judges, "upon the issue which
the legislature has decided." Price v. Illinois, 238 U. S.

Opinion of tile Court.

248 U. S.

446, 452. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., 240 U. S.
342, 357. The answer to the inquiry is that the provisions
are of a kind familiar to legislation and often sustained
and that it is impossible for this Court to say that they
might not be believed to be necessary in order to accomplish the desired ends. See further Atlantic Coast Line
R. 'R. Co. v. Georgia, 234 U. S. 280, 288.
With regard to the other objection urged, the statute
"was not aimed at interstate commerce, but without discrimination sought to promote fair dealing in the described articles of food." Savage v. Jones, 225 U. S. 501,
524. The defendants disclaim any intention to interfere
with the sale of the goods in the original packages by the
consignee, and if the record is thought to raise a doubt
with regard to that it may be met by a modification of the
decree so as-to leave it without prejudice in case prosecutions should be threatened or attempted for such sales.
Some question was raised as to whether the individual
can was not to be regarded as the original package. But
it appears that the cans are brought from Wisconsin,
where Hebe is manufactured, into Ohio in fibre cases
containing forty-eight one-pound cans or ninety-six sixounce cans. The cases are the original packages so far
as the present question is concerned, Austin v. Tennessee,
179 U. S. 343, although no doubt, as shown by McDermott
v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115, 136, the power of Congress
to regulate interstate commerce would, extend for some
purposes to the cans. The Food and Drugs Act of June
30, 1906, c. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, dealt with in McDermott v.
Wisconsin, does not prevent state regulation of domestic
retail sales. Armour & Co. v. North Dakota, 240 U. S.
510, 517. Weigle v. Curtice Brothers Co., ante, 285. Indirect effects upon interstate commerce do not invalidate
the act. Sligh v. Kirkwood, 237 U. S. 52, 61. Savage v.

VAN DEVANTER and MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS, dissenting.
The right to prohibit the sale of plaintiffs' product in the
State of Ohio is mainly rested upon § 12725 of the General Code of that State. In the absence of a construction
by the Supreme Court of Ohio, we must interpret the statute ourselves. We have been unable to come to the conclusion, reached by the majority of the court, as to the
meaning of the law. As the result of this decision is to
exclude from sale in the State of Ohio a.food product not
of itself harmful, but shown to be wholesome, we shall
briefly state the reasons which impel the dissent.
Section 12725 of the General Code of Ohio reads:
"Whoever manufactures, sells, exchanges, exposes or
offers for sale or exchange, condensed milk unless it has
been made from pure, clean, fresh, healthy, unadulterated
and wholesome milk, from which the cream has not been
removed and in which the proportion of milk solids shall
be the equivalent of twelve per cent. of milk solids in
crude milk, twenty-five per cent. of such solids being fat,
and unless the package, can or vessel containing it is distinctly labeled, stamped or marked with its true name,
brand, and by whom and under what name made, shall
be fined not less than fifty dollars nor more than two
hundred dollars, and, for each subsequent offense, shall
be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
five hundred dollars and imprisoned not less than ten days
nor more than ninety days."
The statute defines a crime, and the question is not
different than it would be if the plaintiffs were indicted'
for its violation. While all statutes are to receive a reasonable interpretation, those of a criminal nature are not to
be extended by implication. Condensed milk, when this
statute was passed, was well known to be milk from which
a considerable portion of water had been evaporated.

248 U. S.

Condensed milk to be what its name imports must be
made from whole milk. If not so manufactured, the legislature has the right to provide that the public shall be
advised of the treatment to which it has been subjected.
Skimmed milk, conspicuously labeled as such, may be sold
in the State of Ohio. (§ 12720, Gen. Code, Ohio.) The legislature has shown no intention to condemn it as an unwholesome article of food. It is not less so when condensed.
We are unable to find in these statutes anything which
prohibits the sale of condensed, skimmed milk when it is a
part of a wholesome compound sold for what it really is,
and distinctly labeled as such. In the section under
consideration, 12725, the Ohio legislature was not dealing
with compounds. It was undertaking to assure the purity
of a well-known article of food-condensed milk. The
statute provides that such condensed milk so offered for
sale shall be made of pure, clean, fresh, unadulterated
and wholesome milk from which the cream has not been
removed, and that the can containing it shall be distinctl5
labeled with its true name. With deference to the contrary view, it seems to us that reading the statute in the
light of its purpose to require condensed milk tq be made
from whole milk and sold for what it is, the necessary
result is to exclude the plaintiffs' compound from the
words and meaning of the act. It is not evaporated milk,
and makes no pretense of being such. It is a food compound consisting in part of condensed, skimmed milk.
It is so labeled in unmistakable words in large print on the
can containing it. The label states with all the emphasis
which large type can give that it is a compound made of
"evaporated skimmed milk and vegetable fat." The proportions of the ingredients are stated. The striking label
does not describe condensed milk, and he who reads it
cannot be misled to the belief that he is buying that
article. It is shown to be wholesome and clean and free
from impurities.

HEBE CO. v. SHAW.
297.

DAY, VAN DEVANTER,

and

BRANDEIS,

JJ., dissenting.

It seems to us that the case is within the principle
stated by this court in Hutchinson Ice Cream Co. v. Iowa,
242 U. S. 153, in which a statute forbidding the sale as ice
cream of an article not containing a certain portion of
butter fat was sustained as within the police power of the
State. The statute was construed by the highest court of
the State where it was produced to include articles sold
as ice cream; thus interpreted, we held it to be a constitutional exercise of the police power of the State. So
here, we think the legislature of Ohio intended to deal
with condensed milk when sold as such, and to make
it an offense to sell it when of less than the required purity.
It may be conceded that the statute would include such
an article when not up to the standard, but sold for the
real thing. The public is entitled to protection from deception as well as from impurity. This principle seems to
have controlled the decision of the District Court. The
record discloses that in one or more instances dealers had
supplied this article as condensed milk. But an act or
two of this sort by fraudulent dealers ought not to be
the test of the plaintiffs' right, or control the meaning of
this statute. If such were the case, very few food compounds would escape condemnation. The few instances
of deception shown had not the sanction of plaintiffs'
authority. Such acts did violence to the plain terms in
which the plaintiffs' printed label disclosed that their product was a compound and defined its parts. The label so
truly expresses just what the substance is, that it is difficult to believe that any purchaser could be deceived into
buying the article for something other than it is.
The interdiction of the State Board is not against the
sale of this article as condensed milk, but of all sales of
this compound in the State of Ohio. In our view this
criminal statute, rightly interpreted, does not embrace
the laintiffs' product, and that reason alone should be
sufficient to warrant a reversal of the decree.
