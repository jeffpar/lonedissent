BANKRUPTCY.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 67. Argued November 20, 21, 1935.-Decided December 9, 1935.
A covenant in a lease provided that the landlord, upon reentry,
might relet and apply the resulting rents to rents due under the
lease, and that the tenant should not be entitled to any surplus,
but should remain liable for any deficiency, which, at the option
of the landlord, should become payable on demand or as it accrued from month to mo-.'h. Held no basis for a claim in bankruptcy against the tenant under § 63 of the Bankruptcy Act.

MR.

JUSTICE BUTLER

delivered the opinion of the Court.

-The question is as to provability of a claim growing out
of the termination of a lease by petitioner to the bankrupt and reentry before lessee filed his petition in voluntary bankruptcy. There is involved a construction of
§§ 1 (11), 17 and 63 (a) (b) of the Bankruptcy Act.* The
1 (11). " . . . 'debt' shall include any debt, demand, or
claim provable in bankruptcy." 11 U. S. C., § 1 (11).
Section 17. "A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt
from all of his provable debts . . ." 11 U. S. C., § 35

Opinion of the Court.

District Court for the Southern District of New York
held the claim not provable. 10 F. Supp. 733. The Circuit Court of Appdals affirmed, 77 F. (2d) 1012, following
its decision in Urban Properties Co. v. Irving Trust Co.,
74 F. (2d) 654, in which we granted a writ of certiorari,
295 U. S.725, dismissed on petitioner's motion, post, p. 658.
The decision in the case now before us conflicts with that
of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
in Lloyd Investment Co. v. Schmidt, 66 F. (2d) 371. To
resolve the conflict we granted this writ. 295 U. S. 729.
The lease covered a store building in Newark, New
Jersey, and was for a term of ten years commencing
August 1, 1928. The lessee occupied the premises until
April 27, 1932, when, by the above named court, an
equity receiver was appointed for it. The receiver, having disaffirmed the lease, vacated the premises July 18,
and the lessor took possession July 25;. the lessee filed its
petition in bankruptcy August 27. Later, the lessor relet
the premises for the balance of the term but for rents
less than those reserved in the lease to the bankrupt.
That lease provides that, if the premises shall become
vacant or the term shall end prior to the expiration date
because of any act of the tenant, the landlord may reenter, relet the premises and apply the rents received on
Section 63. "Debts which may be proved. (a) Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a
fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against
him, whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon which
would have been recoverable at that date or with a rebate of interest
upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest; ....
(4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or
implied; . ..
"(b) Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to
application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall
direct, and may thereafter be proved and allowed against his estate."

lease, and that the tenant shall not be entitled to any.
surplus, but shall remain liable for any deficiency which,
at the option of the landlord, shall become payable on
demand or as it accrues from month to month.
The petitioner filed a claim consisting of two items.
The first was for $600 filed as a priority claim covering
rent for March and April, 1932, and the second was for
$16,025 filed as a general claim for the difference between
the rent reserved in the lease and the fair rental value of
the premises for the balance of the term. The trustee
objected to the claim and sought to have it reduced to
$1,000 admittedly owing for past due rent at the time
of filing the petition in bankruptcy. The first item having been allowed and paid as a claim entitled to priority,
under New Jersey-law, the referee reduced the second
item to $400.
The covenant before us is like that considered in Manhattan Propertiesv. Irving Trust Co., 291 U. S. 320. The
difference between the cases is that here the reentry occurred before, while in that case there was no reentry until
after, bankruptcy. The petitioner's statement of claim
does not follow the covenant in his lease. It is made as
if it rested on a covenant providing for damages equal to
rents reserved less rental value for the rest of the term,
such as that on which the landlord prevailed in Irving
Trust Co. v. Perry Co., 293 U. S. 307. But petitioner's
claim must be adjudged on the basis of the covenant that
in his interest was inserted in the lease. The only measure available to him is the difference between the rents
reserved in the lease and what he might choose or happen
to get on reletting. Under the clause in question, it was,
at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, uncertain, a mere matter of speculation, whether any liability
ever would arise under it. § 63 (a). Riggin v. Magwire,

re Merrill & Baker, 186 Fed. 312; cf. Maynard v. Elliott,
283 U. S. 273, 278. The method here prescribed is not
governed by any rule or principle written into or derivable from the lease or recognized in law as governing in
such cases as this. Without transgressing the covenant,
he may make, terminate and renew leases covering the
premises without regard to rental value. He is free to
fix or control the amount of lessee's liability, at least
to the extent of the difference between free use and
reasonable rental value of the premises. It is clear that
the specified basis is not a valid one for the proving of
claims under § 63.
