CERTIFICATE FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT.

No. 32.

Argued November 12, 13, 1935.-Decided December 9,

1935.
1. A suit by or on behalf of a State upon a judgment for taxes is a
suit of a civil nature within the meaning of § 24, Jud. Code, defining the jurisdiction of the District Courts. P. 270.
2. The obligation to pay taxes is not penal; it is a statutory liability,
quasi-contractual in nature, enforcible, if there be no exclusive
statutory remedy, in the civil courts by the common-law action of
debt or indebitatus assumpsit. This was the rule established in
the English courts before the Declaration of Independence.
P. 271.
3. The objection that the courts in one State will not entertain a
suit to recover taxes due to another or upon a judgment for such
taxes goes not to the jurisdiction but to the merits, and raises
a question which District Courts are competent to decide. P. 272.
4. Even if full faith and credit are not commanded, there is nothing
in the Constitution and laws of the United States which requires
a court of a State to deny relief upon a judgment recovered in
'another State because it is for taxes. P. 272,

5. Where suits to enforce the laws of one State are entertained in
the courts of another on the principle of comity, the federal District Courts sitting in that State may and should entertain them,
if to do so will not infringe federal law or policy. P. 272.
6. Assuming that the courts of one State, nd federal courts therein,
are not required by the Constitution, Art. IV, § 1, and the Act of
Congress passed thereunder, to entertain suits to recover taxes
levied under the statutes of another State, they cannot deny full
faith and credit to judgments recovered in the other State for
such taxes. P. 275.
7. The opinion in Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S.
265, is disapproved insofar as it can be taken to suggest that full
faith and credit are not required with respect to a judgment unless
the original cause of action would have been entitled to like credit.

IN ANSWER to a question certified by the court below,
on an appeal from a judgment of the District Court dismissing an action in Illinois based on a judgment for
taxes recovered by the plaintiff County in Wisconsin.
Mr. Herbert H. Naujoks, Assistant Attorney General
of Wisconsin, and Mr. Clark J. A. Hazelwood, with whom
Mr. James E. Finnegan, Attorney General, and Mr. 0. L.
O'Boyle were on the brief, for Milwaukee County.
Mr. Irving Herriott, with whom Mr. W. Ward Smith
was on the brief, for M. E. White Co.
MR. JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes here under § 239 of the Judicial Code,
28 U. S. C. 346, on certificate of the Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit, which presents a question of law
concerning which the instructions of this Court are desired for the proper decision of the case.
The relevant facts, as stated by the certificate, are that
the appellant, Milwaukee County, a county and citizen
of Wisconsin, brought suit in the District Court for
Northern Illinois against M. E. White Company, appellee,

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

296 U.S.

a corporation and citizen of Illinois, to recover on a judgment for $52,165.84, which appellant had duly recovered
and entered against the appellee in the Circuit Court of
Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, a court of general jurisdiction. The judgment is said to be for taxes duly assessed against appellee, under Wisconsin statutes, upon
income received from its business transacted within the
state under state license. The district court dismissed
the cause on the ground that, as the suit was in substance
brought to enforce the revenue laws of Wisconsin, it could
not be maintained in the district court in Illinois.
The question certified is as follows:
"Should a United States District Court in and for the
State of Illinois, having jurisdiction of the parties, entertain jurisdiction of an action therein brought, based upon
a valid judgment for over $3,000 rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin against
the same defendant, which judgment was predicated upon
an income tax due from the defendant to the State of
Wisconsin?"
Appellee insists that the question should be answered
in the negative (1) because such a suit is not within the
judicial power conferred upon district courts by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and (2) because
a judgment for taxes constitutes an exception to the requirement of the Constitution and statutes of the United
States that full faith and credit be given in each state to
the public acts and judicial proceedings of every state.
1. By § 24 of the Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C., § 31, district courts are given original jurisdiction "of all suits
of a civil nature at common law or in equity," where there
is the requisite diversity of citizenship and the amount in
controversy exceeds $3,000. In this grant of jurisdiction
of causes arising under state as well as federal law the
phrase "suits of a civil nature" is used in contradistinction to "crimes and offenses," as to which the juris-

Opinion of the Court.

diction of the district courts is restricted by .§ 24 (2) to
offenses against the United States. Thus suits of a civil
nature within the meaning of the section are those which
do not involve criminal prosecution or punishment, and
which are of a character traditionally cognizable by courts
of common law or of equity. Such are suits upon a judgment, foreign or domestic, for a civil liability, of a court
having jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties, which
were maintainable at common law upon writ of debt, or
of indebitatus assumpsit.'
Even if the judgment is deemed to be colored by the
nature of the obligation whose validity it establishes and
we are free to reixamine it and, if we find it to be based
on an obligation penal in character, to refuse to enforce
it outside the state where rendered, see Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., 127 U. S. 265, 292, et seq.; compare
Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U. S. 230, still the obligation to
pay taxes is not penal. It is a statutory liability, quasicontractual in nature, enforcible, if there is no exclusive
statutory remedy, in the civil courts by the common law
action of debt or indebitatus asumpsit. United States
v. Chamberlin, 219 U. S. 250; Price v. United States, 269
U. S. 492; DollarSavings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall.
227; and see Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531,

Comyn's Digest (Title "Dett," A, 9); 1 Chitty on Pleading, 123; cf. Attorney General v. Sewell, 4 M. & W. 77.
The objection that the courts in one state will not
entertain a suit to recover taxes due to another or upon
a judgment for such taxes, is not rightly addressed to any
want of judicial power in courts which are authorized to
entertain civil suits at law. It goes not to the jurisdiction but to the merits, and raises a question which district
courts are competent to decide. See Illinois Central R.
Co. v. Adams, 180 U. S. 28; General Investment Co. v.
New York Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 228, 230; Becker
Steel Co. v. Cummings, ante, p. 74.
That defense is without merit if full faith and credit
must be given the judgment. But even if full faith and
credit is not commanded there is nothing in the Constitution and laws of the United States which requires a
court of a state to deny relief upon a judgment because
it is for taxes. A state court, in conformity to state
policy, may, by comity, give a remedy which the full faith
and credit clause does not compel. Young v. Masci, 289
U. S. 253; Bond v. Hume, 243 U. S. 15; cf. Tennessee
Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354; Clark Plastering Co. v. Seaboard Surety Co., 259 N. Y. 424; 182

(Mass.) 389; Schuler v. Schuler, 209 Ill. 522; 71 N. E. 16.
A suit to recover taxes due under the statutes of another
state has been allowed without regard to the compulsion
of the full faith ar-d credit clause. Holshouser v. Copper
Co., 138 N. C. 248; 50 S. E. 650. The privilege may be
extended by statute. See N. Y. Laws, 1932, . 333.
Where suits to enforce the laws of one state are entertained in the courts of another on the principle of comity,
the federal district courts sitting in that state may entertain them and should if they do not infringe federal law

418; Bond v. Hume, supra; Northern Pacific R. Co. v.
Babcock, 154 U. S. 190, 197, 198; Dennick v. Railroad
Co., 103 U. S. 11; see Bradford Electric Light Co. v.
Clapper, 286 U. S. 145, 161.
2. The faith and credit required to be given to judgments does not depend on the Constitution alone. Article IV, § 1, not only commands that "full faith and credit
shall be given in each state to the public acts, records and
judicial proceedings of every other state" but it adds
"Congress may, by general laws, prescribe the manner in
which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved
and the effect thereof." And Congress has exercised this
power, by Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U. S. C. 687,
which provides the manner of proof of judgments of one
state in the courts of another, and specifically directs that
judgments "shall have such faith and credit given to
them in every court within the United States as they have
by law or usage in the courts of the State from which
they are taken."
Such exception as there may be to this all-inclusive
command is one which is implied from the nature of our
dual system of government, and recognizes that consistently with the full faith and credit clause there may be
limits to the extent to which the policy of one state, in
many respects sovereign, may be subordinated to the
policy of another. That there are exceptions has often
been pointed out, Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642;
Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294
U. S. 532, 546; Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,

and in some instances decided. See Haddock v. Haddock,

say what their limits may be, we assume for present purposes that the command of the Constitution and of the
statute is not all-embracing and direct our inquiry to the
question whether a state to which a judgment for taxes
is taken may have a policy against its enforcement meriting recognition as a permissible limitation upon the full
faith and credit clause. Of that question this Court is
the final arbiter. See Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial
Accident Comm'n, supra, 547; Bradford Electric Light
Co. v. Clapper,supra, 157-162.
It is said that in answering it the court should examine
the record which supports the judgment and refuse to
give credit to the judgment, if the cause of action upon
which it is founded is one which it would not enforce,
and appellee urges that a suit for taxes imposed by state
statute will not be entertained outside the taxing state.
It has often been said,2 and in a few cases held, ' that
statutes imposing taxes are not entitled to full faith and
credit. Other obligations to pay money arising under the
statutes of one state must be given recognition in courts
of another. Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243; Broderick v. Rosner, supra; Bradford Electric Light Co. v.
Clapper, supra. But it is insisted that to this rule taxing
statutes constitute an exception, analogous to that relat'Henry v. Sargeant, 13 N. H. 321; Gulledge Bros. Lumber Co. v.

ing to penal laws, because the courts of one state should
not he called upon to scrutinize the relations of a foreign state with its own citizens, such as are involved in
its revenue laws, and thus commit the state of the forum
to positions which might be seriously embarrassing to
itself or its neighbors. See Moore v. Mitchell, 30 F. (2d)
600, 602, 604; Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 610.1.
Whether one state must enforce the revenue laws of
another remains an open question in this Court. See
Moore v. Mitchell, 281 U. S. 18, 24. But we d6 not stop
to inquire whether the considerations which have been
thought to preclude the enforcement of the penal laws
of one state in the courts of another are applicable to
taxing statutes; or whether the mere possibility of embarrassment in their enforcement should stay the hand
of the court of another state in cases where in fact such
embarrassment will not occur. For present purposes we
will assume that the courts of 'one state are not required
to entertain a suit to recover taxes levied under the statutes of another and confine our inquiry to the single
question whether they must nevertheless give full faith
and creditto judgments for such taxes.
A cause of action on a judgment is different from that
upon which the judgment was entered. In a suit upon
a money judgment for a civil cause of action the validity
of the claim upon which it was founded is not open to
inquiry, whatever its genesis. Regardless of the nature
of the right which gave rise to it, the judgment is an
obligation to pay money in the nature of a debt upon a
specialty. Recovery upon it can be resisted only on the
grounds that the court which rendered it was without
jurisdiction, Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714; D'Arcy v.
Ketchum, 11 How. 165; Tilt v. Kelsey, 207 U. S. 43; or
that it has ceased to be obligatory because of payment
or other discharge; Anderson v. Clark, 70 Ga. 362; Haggerty v. Amory, 7 Allen (Mass.) 458; First Nat. Bank v.

How. 437; McNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352; Cole v. Cunningham, 133 U. S. 107, 112.
Trial of these issues, even though the judgment be for
taxes incurred under the laws of another state, requires
no scrutiny of its revenue laws or of relations established
by those laws with its citizens, and calls for no pronouncement upon the policy of a sister state. It involves no
more embarrassment than the interstate rendition of
fugitives from justice, the constitutional command for
which is no more specific than that requiring full faith
and credit. Foreign judgments are not liens and are not
entitled to execution in the state to which they are
brought. See McElmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312; Cole v.
Cunningham, supra, 112; cf. Gasquet v. Fenner, 247 U. S.
16; Sistare v. Sistare, 218 U. S. 1, 26. They can no more
demand priority over domestic claims for taxes than a
judgment upon a simple contract debt, which is equally
a binding obligation of the judgment debtor where rendered, and to which full faith and credit must be accorded.
We can perceive no greater possibility of embarrassment in litigating the validity of a judgment for taxes
and enforcing it than any other for the payment of
money. The very purpose- of the full faith and credit

MILWAUKEE COUNTY v. WHITE CO.
268

Opinion of the Court.

clause was to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a
single nation throughout which a remedy upon a just
obligation might be demanded as of right, irrespective of
the state of its origin. That purpose ought not lightly
to be set aside out of deference to a local policy which,
if it exists, would seem to be too trivial to mqrit serious
consideration when weighed against the policy of the constitutional provision and the interest of the state whose
judgment is challenged. In the circumstances here disclosed no state can be said to have a legitimate policy
-against payment of its neighbor's taxes, the obligation of
which has been judicially established by courts to whose
judgments in practically every other instance it must
give full faith and credit. Compare Fauntleroy v. Lum,
supra.
In numerous cases this Court has held that credit must
be given to the judgment of another state although the
forum would not be required to entertain the suit on
which the judgment was founded; that considerations of
policy of the forum which would defeat a suit upon the
original cause of action are not involved in a suit upon
the judgment and are insufficient to defeat it. Full faith
and credit is required to be given to the judgment of another state although the original suit on which it was
based arose in the state of the forum and was barred
there by the Statute of Limitations when the judgment
was rendered; Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall.,290; Roche v.
McDonald, 275 U. S. 449; and where the original suit was
upon a gambling contract invalid by the law of the forum
where it was made; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra. It was
i-equired where the judgment was for wrongful death,
although it was thought that the statute giving the recevery was not entitled to full faith and credit. Kennea

v. Supreme Lodge, supra; compare Converse v. Hamilton, supra; Broderick v. Rosner, supra; see also American Express Co. v. Mullins, 212 U. S. 311.
Appellee especially relies upon the statement in the
opinion of this Court in Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance
Co., supra, that (292, 293):
"The essential nature and real foundation of a cause of
action are not changed by recovering judgment upon it;
and the technical rules, which regard the original claim as
merged in the judgment, and the judgment as implying a
promise by the defendant to pay it, do not preclude a
court, to which a judgment is presented for affirmative
action, (while it cannot go behind the judgment for the
purpose of examining into the validity of the claim,) from
ascertaining whether the claim is really one of such a
nature that the court is authorized to enforce it."
In that case it was held that this Court was without original jurisdiction of a suit brought by Wisconsin to recover
upon a judgment obtained in its own courts for a penalty
imposed by its statutes for the failure of an insurance
company to file an annual report. So far as the opinion
can be taken to suggest that full faith and credit is not
required with respect to h judgment unless the original
cause of action would have been entitled to like credit, it
is inconsistent with decisions of this Court already noted
and was discredited in Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, 36, 37,
and Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, supra, 414.
The precise question now presented appears to have
been decided in only a single case, New York v. Coe Manufacturing Co., 112 N. J. L. 536; 172 AtI. 198. In holding in that case that a New York judgment for taxes was
entitled to full faith and credit, the New Jersey Court
of Errors and Appeals pointed out that questions of the
construction and application of the New York tax laws
were not the subject of litigation in New Jersey, since

MILWAUKEE COUNTY v. WHITE CO.
268

Opinion of the Court.

they had been conclusively determined by the New York
judgment, which established liability for the tax.'
We conclude that a judgment is not to be denied full
faith and credit in. state and federal courts merely because it is for taxes.
We intimate no opinion whether a suit upon a judgment for an obligation created by a penal law, in the
international sense, see Huntington v. Attrill, supra, 677,
is within the jurisdiction of the federal district courts, or
whether full faith and credit must be given to such a
judgment even though a suit for the penalty before reduced to judgment could n~t be maintained outside of
the state where imposed. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., supra.
- The findings of the Wisconsin court, upon which the
judgment in the present case was predicated, are appended as an exhibit to the certificate. They indicate
that the judgment included interest and a "penalty" of
'The Restatement of Conflict of Laws of the American Law Institute, 1934, declares:
§ 610. "No action can be maintained on a right created by the law
of a foreign state as a method of furthering its own governmental
interests."
This is stated by Comment (c) to refer to claims for taxes. It also
declares:
§ 443. "A valid foreign judgment for the payment of money which
has been obtained in favor of a state, a state agency, or a private
person, on a cause of action creited by the law of the foreign state
as a method of furthering its own governm6ntal interests will not be
enforced."
Comment (b) states that the enforcement of such a judgment is not
required by the full faith and credit clause. But illustration 4 states
that a state judgment against a foreign corporation for a stipulated
fee for the privilege of doing business within the state is entitled to
full faith and credit.
These conclusions should be compared with New York v. Coe Manufacturing Co., supra. See Beale, Conflict of Laws, §§ 443.1, 610.2.

1. A decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia construing the Longshoremen's and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act-the Act being national in scope and
not confined in its operation to the District of Columbia, where
it applies as a workmen's compensation law-may present a question of general importance which this Court will review on certiorari. P. 285.

if the injury was occasioned solely . . . by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself . . ." Section

20 provides that in any proceeding to enforce a claim for compensation under the Act, "it shall be presumed, in the absence of

with accident and suicide. The deputy commissioner made a finding of suicide and denied an award. Held:
