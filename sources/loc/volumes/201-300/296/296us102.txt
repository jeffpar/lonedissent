a year later, the daughter resigned a new trustee could be
appointed only by the written nomination of the two remaining trustees with the approval of all the beneficiaries
of the trust. By such concerted action Mrs. Sargent was
again-appointed a trustee. She then acquired any power
for the future to participate.in a termination of the trust,
solely by virtue of the action of the other trustees and the
beneficiaries and not in any sense by virtue of any power
reserved to herself as settlor in the original declaration of
trust. We think, therefore, that neither technically nor
in substance does the power to terminate as it existed from
1921 to the date of Mrs. Sargent's death fall within

delivered the opinion. of the

Court.
These cases were brought here on writs of certiorari to
resolve a conflict between Circuits with respect to the application of § 101 of the Revenue Act of 1928,1 which permits taxpayers, at their option, to pay at the rate of twelve
and one-half per cent. on capital net gains. Subsection
(c) (8), so far as material, is: "'Capital assets' means
property held by the taxpayer for more than two years
."
Whether property acquired from a decedent
through intestacy, or a general bequest, is, within the
meaning of the clause, held by the taxpayer from the date
of the decedent's death or from the date of distribution, is
the matter. in dispute.
The taxpayers are: in Nos. i10, 111, and 494, residuary
legatees. in No 24 the donee of a widow who elected to
take against her husband's will, and in No. 439 one of

those entitled under the intestate laws. In each case the
taxpayer sold the asset more than two years after the
death of the decedent from whom title was .derived but
less than two years after distribution by the estate's representatives. In each a return was made of the profit on
the sale as capital net gain taxable at twelve and one-half
per cent., but the Commissioner refused to recognize the
correctness of the returns and calculated the. tax at the
normal and surtax rates payable on ordinary income.
The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner
in four of the cases.' In No. 110 the tax was paid and
judgment recovered in a suit for refund.' The Circuit
Courts of Appeals of the Third, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits affirmed the action of the Board; that of the First
Circuit reversed the Board in No. 111 and affirmed the
judgment of the District Court in No.

110.4

The Commissioner contends that until actual distribution property cannot be said to be held by one having
an interest in a decedent's estate, and, even if this be not
true, § 113 (a) (5), making value at the date of distribution the basis for calculating gain in such cases, requires that the word "held" in § 101 (a) (8) be construed to set the same date as the time at which the
holding shall begin.
The taxpayers on the other hand assert that property
is, in contemplation of law, held from the date of acquisition; and one deriving property from a decedent's estate
through devise, bequest or intestacy acquires the property at the date of death and holds it from that date; that
so all prior acts using similar phraseology have been interpreted:by the Treasury; that the re6nactment of these

without significant change constitutes a legislative confirmation of the administiative interpretation; and that
§ 113, having to do with the basis for the calculation of
the tax, cannot alter the plain meaning of § 101 which
prescribes the length of time property must be held to
constitute it a capital asset. We conclude that the date
of the decedent's death is that from which the period of
holding should be computed.
In the Revenue Act of 1921, the first which granted a
special rate of tax on capital net gain, § 206 (a) (6) defined capital assets as " property acquired and held by the
taxpayer . . . for more than two years."' From the corresponding sections of the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926,
and 1928, the word " acquired "'was omitted. "Acquired"
in the phrase "acquired and held " was mere surplusage
and doubtless was elided from the later acts for that reason. 6 As indicated in Helvering v., New York Trust Co.,
292 U. S. 455, 469, the omission did not change the meaning of capital assets as defined in the earlier act.
In connon understanding, to hold property is to own it.
In order to own or hold one must acquire. The date of
acquisition is, then, that from which to compute the duration of ownership or the length of holding. Whether
under local law title to personal property passes from a
decedent to the legatee or next of kin at death subject to
a withholding of possession for purposes of administration,7 or passes to the personal representative for the purposes of administration,-the title of the beneficiary,
though derived through the executor relating back to the

date of death, 8-is for present .purposes immaterial. In
either case, the date of acquisition within the intent of
the Revenue Act is the date of death.'
The Commissioner has heretofore administered the section upon this theory. As respects the Revenue Act of
1921, he so ruled in 1923,1" and again in a very full memorandum in 1924.11 It was stated in briefs and at the
bar that these rulings 'have never been cancelled or revoked, and the statement was not challenged. The repetition of the definition without material change in the subsequent acts, including that of 1928, amounts to a confirmation of the administrative interpretation. 2 There is
nothing in the section, its history, or the administrative
practice, to enlarge or alter the connotation commonly
ascribed to the word "held."
The Commissioner says, however, that Congress has
undoubted power to set the date of distribution as the
terminus a quo, and that an examination of the whole
statute discloses that the purpose was to alter the preexisting rule to that end.
In support of this argument it is pointed out that § 113,

N. W. 869. The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals in No. 494
discloses that the taxpayer asserted that the, law of California was
the same. The Court, however, did not discuss or decide the point,
and we are referred to no pertinent authorities.

Opinion of the Court.

which prescribes the basis for determining capital gain or
loss, radically altered preexisting law on the subject in
such a way as to show an intent to change the normal
meaning of the word "held" in § 101 (c) (8). In the
Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 the sections dealing with
the basis for calculating capital gain or loss provided that
in the case of property acquired by bequest, devise, or
inheritance, the basis should be the fair market price or
value of such property at the time of such acquisition. 3
As we have seen, in common understanding, with which
the administrative interpretation was in accord, the time
of acquisition in such cases is the time of the decedent's
death. The date for ascertaining the basic value, and the
date of commencement of the two year holding period
were, therefore, under these Acts, identical. Committee
Reports indicate that by reason of doubt as to what is in
fact the moment of acquisition by persons having various
relations to a decedent's estate, Congress resolved arbitrarily to fix the basis for the calculation of capital gain
or loss.
In consequence the Act of 1928, for the language used
in the earlier acts, substituted this:
' Property Transmitted at Death.-If personal property was acquired by specific bequest, or if real property
was acquired by general or specific devise or by intestacy,
the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at
the time of the death of the decedent. If the property
was acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent,
the basis in the hands of the estate shall be the fair
market value of the property at, the time of the death of
the decedent. In all other cases if the property was acquired either by will or by intestacy, the basis shall be the
fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer." § 113 (a) (5).

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

296 U. S.

No change was made in the phraseology of § 101 (c)
(8) from that used in prior acts defining capital assets as
"property held by the taxpayer . . . for more than two
years." The argument for the Commissioner is that the
alteration of the basis date necessarily implies an intent
to make a similar alteration in the origin date of the holding period. We think the argument cannot prevail. The
Committee Reports disclose no purpose to alter the rule
laid down in the earlier statutes and reenacted in § 101
(a) (8). Congress must be taken to have been familiar
with the existing administrative interpretation. The fact
that the two sections deal with the same general subject-capital gains-is cited in support of the Commissioner's position that they ought to be consistently applied. There is, however, nothing novel in the naming
of arbitrary "basis" dates differing from the admitted
dates of acquisition. The outstanding example is the use
of March 1, 1913, value in certain cases for property
theretofore acquired. Indeed, sub-paragraphs (A), (B),
and (C) of § 101 (c) (8) fix arbitrary dates for calculation of the period of holding of capital assets, which differ
from the time of actual acquisition, showing that Congress, had it desired to change the connotation of the
word "held," as used in § 101 (c) (8), could readily have
done so.
Counsel urge that Helvering v. New York Trust Co.,
supra, requires us to construe § 101 (c) (8) as fixing the
same date for the beginning of the holding period as § 113
(a) (5) sets for determining the basis. We think, however, that the case is not authority here. The Act of 1921
exhibited an inconsistency in that while a donee was not
permitted to tack his tenure to that of his donor, he was
required to. use his donor's basis. This inconsistency
flowed from a literal reading of the separate sections
dealing With these two subjects. Such a result the court
held would run counter to the very policy and purpose of

McFEELY v. COMMISSIONER.
102

Opinion of the Court.

the capital gains rate reduction, which was to encourage
sales of capital assets, and would penalize the taxpayer
making such sales. The departure from the strict terms
of the act was justified in order to secure him the benefit
intended to be conferred. The court was careful to say
"The rule that where a statute contains no ambiguity, it
must be taken literally and given effect according to its
language is a sound one . . ." That rule was held inapplicable for the reasons stated.
Here the rule obtains that a taxing statute, if of doubtful intent, should be construed favorably to the taxpayer. 4 To depart from the literal meaning of § 101 (c)
(8) would be to penalize the taxpayer by lengthening the
period during which the capital asset must be held in
what is really a single ownership to obtain the advantage
of the reduced tax. Under these circumstances we ought
not to depart from the plain meaning of the section in: an
effort to bring about a uniformity which it is claimed
Congress intended but failed to express.
The instant case is much closer to Helvering v. Bliss,
293 U. S. 144, where the Government asserted that a
section in terms applicable to the taxpayer's right to make
a deduction from gross income should be modified in
meaning and effect by another dealing with a related
topic,-related in the sense that both sections bore on
the ultimate amount of the tax-independent, however,
in the sense that one related to the deduction permitted
in ascertaining taxable income, while the other fixed the
rate of tax on a portion of such income. We refused to
modify the obvious meaning of the applicable section to
accord, as was claimed, with the other.5
Crooks v. Harrelson,282 U. S. 55, 61.
15 Compare Relvering v. Twin Bell Oil Syndicate, 293 U. S. 312,
14

where the taxpayer's plea for modification of the meaning of one section based upon the inconsistency with another was denied. In that
case both sections had 'to do with depletion, the one with the calculation of the amount thereof, the other with the apportionment of
depletion between the lessor and lessee.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

296 U. S.

A further argument of the Commissioner is that, since
under § 101 (c) (8) (B) the period for which the taxpayer has held property, however acquired, is to include
any period during which such property was held by any
other person if, under § 113, the property has, for purposes of determining gain or loss, the same basis in the
taxpayer's hands as it would have in the hands of such
other person, it is impossible to construe § 101 independently of § 113. It is said that Congress has clearly indicated the successor in title should not have the benefit of
his predecessor's tenure when he was not required to use
the predecessor's basis, and, therefore, tenure and basis
are so connected in the two sections that the one may not
fairly be construed without reference to the other. The
argument is not convincing.
The reference in sub-paragraph (B) is not to paragraph
(a) (5) of § 113 but to the entire section, which embodies
a number of instances of the arbitrary fixing of basis dates
for ascertaining capital gain or loss. Sub-paragraph (B)
has, on its face, no relevance to the facts in the cases here
for decision.
We are of opinion that § 101 (c) (8) is clear on its face;
that it deals solely with the tenure necessary to claim a,
rate of twelve and one-half per cent. on capital net gain
as distinguished from the normal and surtax rate upon ordinary gain; that § 113 (a) (5) deals only with the basis
for the calculation of the tax in cases falling under § 101
(c) (8); that the sections are not inconsistent and that
each should be read as affecting the subject to which alone
it applies.

SCHUYLKILL TRUST CO. v. PENNSYLVANIA.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA.
No. 3.

Argued October 14, 1935.-Decided November 11, 1935.

1. A corporation made liable in the first instance for a state tax on
its shares, which it may pay from its funds or collect from the
shareholders, but for which no lien is given either to the corporation or to the State, has a standing to contest the validity of the
tax. P. 118.
2. Much weight attaches to the characterization of a state tax, or
the interpretation of a state law, by the State Supreme Court, but
where a federal question is involved, this Court must determine for
itself the true nature of the tax by ascertaining its operation and
effect. P. 119.
3. A Pennsylvania tax, levied in the first instance on a trust company and in terms a tax upon its shares, was measured by so much
of the company's net assets as remained after deducting the
amounts represented by shares owned by it in Pennsylvania corporations which were already taxed or were exempted by the state
law. No corresponding deduction was made on account of nontaxable bonds of the United States and of its instrumentalities, or
on account of national bank shares already taxed as permitted by
R. S., § 5219. Held invalid as discriminating against the federal
securities and national bank shares. Pp. 119, 120.
4. Whether a federal question, urged to this Court on an appeal, from
the Supreme Court. of a State, was raised in that court, is itself a
federal question which this Court must decide by an examination
