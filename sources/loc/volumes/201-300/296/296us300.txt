an assessment against the executor personally as legatee under
the. will; the liability of the legatee, if any, must first be determined by the Commissioner in a new inquiry and expressed in a
new assessment. P. 305.
2. Assuming that executors, in petitioning for review of an assessment (Revenue Act 1926, § 280) against the estate, could by
waiver or estoppel subject themselves to being held liable in the

P. 307.
3. Assuming that, under § 281 (b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, an
executor, by failing to give notice of his discharge to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, renders himself liable qua executor
for an assessment under § 280 directed against the estate but made
after his discharge, the Act in this respect is not to be construed
as applicable to executors who were discharged from their fiduciary
liability before the Act was approyed. P. 308.

and in some of the States, an executor who has been discharged
after a full and fair settlement of the estate, is functus officio.

Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed, on appeal, a
decision of the Board of Tax Appeals overruling an assessment made against a decedent's estate as transferee of part
of the assets of a corporation which was dissolved while
liable for income and profits taxes. The assessment
against the estate was made after the executors, one of
whom is the petitioner in this case, had been discharged.

Opinion of the Court.

Mr. N. A. Townsend, with whom Solicitor General
Reed, Assistant Attorney General Wideman, and Messrs.
James 1V. Morris and Maurice J. Mahoney were on the
brief, for respondent.
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The controversy is one as to the liability of the executor
and legatee of a shareholder in a dissolved corporation
for a deficiency of income and profits taxes assessed
against the company.
In September, 1919, the Van Sicklen Company, an
Illinois corporation, sold all its assets to a Delaware corporation, the Van Sicklen Speedometer Company, and
was thereupon dissolved. In consideration of the sale it
received $250,000 in cash and 5,000 shares in the new
company, which it distributed forthwith among its own
shareholders. One of these shareholders was Charles H.
tIulburd. His distributive portion on the dissolution of
the company was $8,000 in cash and 160 shares of no-par
stock. He died on January 14, 1924, leaving a will by
which his son, De Forest Jiulburd, and Hugh McBirney
Johnston were appointed executors. The son, who is the
petitioner in this court, was also a legatee and devisee.
The coixecutor, Johnston, is dead.
In December, 1919, the Van Sicklen Company filed a
corporation income and profits tax return for the fiscal
year ending September 30, 1919. The return, however,
was inadequate. Accordingly, on November 17, 1924,
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made an additional assessment in the sum of $227,872.06, with penalties in the sum of $113,936.03. Unable to collect this deficiency from the company after the distribution of its
assets, he turned to the shareholders. On October 27,
1926, he mailed a letter to the "Estate of Charles H.

Opinion of the Court.

Hulburd, c/o De Forest Hulburd, 86 East Randolph
Street' Chicago, Illinois." In this he gave notice of a proposed assessment "against the estate" by reason of its
liability as transferee of the assets of the Illinois corporation. The amount of that liability was stated to be
$24,000, but was afterwards reduced to $8,000, the cash
received by the testator. In announcing this assessment,
the Commissioner acted in reliance on § 280 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 U. S. C. App. § 1069), which permits
an assessment against the transferee of a taxpayer upon
the taxpayer's default. Before the passage of that act
shareholders who had received the assets of a dissolved
corporation might be compelled to discharge unpaid corporate taxes, but only by bill in equity or action at law.

summary procedure was added by the statute. Phillips v.

the Commissioner is to apportion the deficiency among
the transferees of the property and to give notice accordingly. Revenue Act of 1926, § 274. If the transferee is
dissatisfied, he may petition the Board of Tax Appeals to
redetermine the existence of liability and its proper distribution.
On October 27, 1926, when notice of the proposed assessment was sent to the petitioner, the estate of Charles
H. Hulburd had been settled, the assets distributed and
the executors discharged. 1 The discharged executors sub1 The

mitted to the Board of Tax Appeals a petition for review
disclaiming liability. They stated in effect that they
were the persons who had been appointed executors by
the will of Charles H. Hulburd, but that their responsibilities as such were ended. Enumerating their objections to the assessment they alleged that the action of the
Commissioner was erroneous for the reason that the estate
had been "wholly distributed and settled and your petitioners duly discharged as executors thereof." Thus, as
early as December, 1926 (when the petition for review
was filed) and before the period of limitation under the
statute had run against a new assessment against legatees
or devisees (Revenue Act of 1926, § 280 (b) (2)), the
Commissioner was put upon notice that the deficiency
had been assessed against persons no longer liable and
was given the opportunity to impose it upon others. Instead of doing this he stood his ground and prayed for an
order that his determination be confirmed.
The Board of Tax Appeals held that "at the time the
notice was mailed there was no liability of the estate or
of the petitioners as executors." It put aside the consideration of a possible "liability of any of the beneficiarieE
with the estate of said decedent, showing that said estate has been
fully administered.
"And it now appearing to the court that more than one year has
elapsed since the granting of letters testamentary herein; that due
notice has been given to all of the heits at law, legatees and beneficiaries; that all assets of said estate have been collected; that no
claims have been filed against said estate; that specific legacies have
been paid; that the inheritance tax, federal estate tax, income tax,
court costs and all other costs and expenses of administration herein
have been paid, and that the balance of said estate has been distributed according to the last will and testament of said decedent, and
guardian ad litem consenting to the approval of said final account.
"It is therefore ordered by the court that said final account be approved and recorded, that the estate be and it is declared settled and
that the executors be and they are hereby discharged."

under the will or the distributees of the assets of the estate" on the ground that no such question was in the
case. 27 B. T. A. 1123; cf. 21 B. T. A. 23. The decision
of the Board was reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit. That court decided that the
executors were liable de bonis testatoris because they had
failed to give notice to the Commissioner that their fiduciary capacity had terminated. Revenue Act of 1926,
§ 281 (b). Besides this, the court held that De Forest
Hulburd was liable individually to the extent of $4,000
because in the record there was evidence, not confirmed
by any finding, that as legatee under the will he had received half of the $8,000 paid to his father on the dissolution of the company. The order of the Board was
accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded for proceedings to conform to the opinion. 76 F. (2d) 736. The
power was thus assumed to change a deficiency assessed
against the executors of an estate into a deficiency to be
assessed against a legatee who had shared in the estate.
To determine the validity of that assumption and to
settle other questions of statutory construction, a writ
of certiorari was granted by this court.
First: The petitioner is not chargeable in this proceeding with liability as legatee under the will of a deceased
ihareholder in the taxpayer, a corporation now dissolved.
The Act of 1926 (c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, § 280; 26 U. S. C.
App. § 1069), in supplementing by a summary procedure
the cumbrous remedy of suit, laid the duty of assessment
upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. "The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of
a taxpayer" was to be "assessed, collected, and paid in
the same manner and subject to the same provisions and
limitations" as in the case of any other tax deficiency.
Ibid. § 280 (a) (1). Pursuant to this mandate the Commissioner did assess a liability and gave notice to the
transferee accordingly. He assessed it to the estate rep33682*-36---20

resented by executors, and not to any one else. "As provided by Section 280 of the Revenue Act of 1926, there is
proposed for assessment against the estate the sum of
$24,000 constituting its liability as a transferee of the
assets of the Van Sicklen Company, Elgin, Illinois." The
Board of Tax Appeals upon petition for review had
power to redetermine the deficiency thus charged to the
estate (Revenue Act of 1926, § 274), but not to charge it
to another. Cf. 26 U. S. C. (1934 ed.) §§ 600, 601, 619;
Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, 277 U. S.
551, 562, 564. If some one else was to be charged, there
would be need of a new assessment, which the Commissioner might make at any time within a year after the
enactment of the statute. Revenue Act of 1926, § 280
(b) (2). In making it he would consider any facts material and relevant for arriving at a just apportionment
of benefits and burdens. The duty to inquire and determine was imposed by the statute upon him and not upon
an agency of government established for the purpose of
revising his decision. These restraints upon jurisdiction
were duly heeded by the Board. It disclaimed the power
or the purpose to pass upon the liability of legatees or
devisees or to assess a tax against them. The same restraints upon jurisdiction were binding upon the Court
of Appeals in reviewing the action of the Board, and
binding with greater emphasis, for the court was without
power to choose between conflicting inferences unless only
one was possible, or to try the case de novo. Helvering v.
Rankin, 295 U. S. 123. The adjudication of liability as
to Hulburd individually was made in seeming forgetfulness of these jurisdictional restrictions. It was error to
ignore them.
In so holding we are not unmindful of the argument for
the respondent that the form of the petition to review
the action of the Commissioner was effective in some way
to enlarge the scope of the proceeding and to subject the

HULBURD v. COMMISSIONER.

Opinion of the Court.

legatee to a new and different assessment. The argument will not stand. There is nothing in the petition
submitted to the Board whereby power was extended
beyond the statutory limits, if we assume provisionally
that consent might be effective, at least in certain circumstances, to bring that result about. The petitioners,
having been discharged as executors, were unwilling to
describe themselves as if they were still acting in that
capacity. What they did was to state the facts .and ask
the judgment of the Board thereon. Far from conceding
that the assessment ran against either of them personally, they protested that in form and in purpose it was
an assessment against the estate and hence was of no
validity after the estate had been settled and the executors discharged. The meaning of their protest was not
subject to misconstruction, nor in fact was it misconstrued, as the opinion of the Board shows, if the fact
might otherwise be doubtful. When the protest had been
made, the remedy available to the Commissioner was
obvious and ample. He had time even then as we have
already pointed out, to announce a new assessment, which
would have brought up the question whether the liability
once resting on the executors had devolved upon another.
For reasons not disclosed he determined not to do so. In
such circumstances the cases cited by the government,
where a formal defect has been ignored in circumstances
tending toward an inference of waiver or estoppel,2 have
no relation to the case at hand. We are not required at

this time to approve or disapprove them. In this case
there was neither waiver nor estoppel, but a steady insistence that the deficiency had been assessed against the
estate and no one else, and that the liability of the estate
had ended. To hold that by consent, either tacit or express, the proceeding had been turned into one to review
the validity of a different assessment, and one never in
fact made, would be a perversion of the record.
Second: The estate having been settled and the executors discharged, the petitioner was functus officio under
the law of Illinois, and was no longer subject to an assessment in his representative capacity.
The Court of Appeals in upholding the liability of the
executors as such put its ruling upon the ground that they
had failed to give notice to the Commissioner of the termination by decree or otherwise of 'theirfiduciary capacity. The notice was thought to be requisite inder § 281
(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926, which is qubted in the
margin. 8 But the Revenue Act of 1926 became a law in
February of that year (§ 286; 26 U. S. C. § 931), and the
executors were discharged in February, 1925. If their
liability as executors was ended at thaw time, the statute
will not be read as attempting to revive it. White v.

powers, rights, duties, and privileges of such person under such section (except that the liability shall be collected from the estate of
such person), until notice is given that the fiduciary capacity has
terminated."

309

Opinion of the Court.

Section 281 (b) being found to be inapplicable, we
have still to determine whether executors who have been
discharged after a full settlement of the estate are subject by the law of Illinois to assessment or suit in their
representative capacity.
By the common law of England an executor was deemed
to carry forward the persona of the testator. Holmes, The
Common Law, pp. 344, 345; Holdsworth's History of
English Law, vol. 3, pp. 563, 573, 574, 583; Littleton's
Tcnures, § 337; Co. Litt. 209, a, b; Mechanics' Savings
Bank v. Waite, 150 Mass. 234, 235; 22 N. E. 915; Chipman v. Manufacturers' National Bank, 156 Mass. 147,
149; 30 N. E. 610. Unless the appointment was qualified
in respect of time, it continued during life. Williams,
Executors, 12th ed., vol. 1, pp. 131, 147, 342. There was
no such thing as a discharge upon a showing of plene
administravit. There was no such thing as a resignation
because of mere unwillingness to go on. Rogers v. Frank,
1 Younge and Jervis 409, 414; In the Goods of Heslop, 1
Robertson's Ecclesiastical Rep. 457, 458; In the Goods of
Veiga, 3 Swabey & Tristram 13, 15. The power to act
might be suspended or revoked through the appointment
of a committee or a receiver if the executor was found
to be physically or mentally incapable. In the Goods of
Binckes, 1 Curteis 286; In the Goods of Newton, 3 Curteis

he had become insolvent after probate or had disappeared
or had misappropriated the assets or otherwise abused his
trust. In the Goods of Covell, [1889] 15 P. D. 8; Estate

Nothing short of clear necessity would cause him to be
ousted. In the absence of peril to the estate, responsibility and power were not to be renounced when once they
had been assumed. So the law of England continues even
now.

. The comnon-law rule is preserved in some of our
states
today, but in many has been abandoned, at times as the
result of statute, at times through the combined force of
statute and decision. The diversity of doctrine is surprising, and so, often, is its obscurity. The commentators tell us, however, and, as the cases show, correctly,
that the growing tendency in this country is away from
the English rule." Some states, though they make provision for an accounting, make none for a discharge, and
hold the executor suable after the estate has been distributed, upon the chance that other property may be
discovered later on. The judgment will be collectible out
of assets in futuro, or quando acciderint, as was said in
early days. Williams, supra, vol. 2, p. 1253; Mary Shipley's Case, 4 Coke, Part 8, p. 408; Noell v. Nelson, 2
Saund. 226. This in effect is the practice in New York
(Mahoney v. Bernhard, 45 App. Div. 499, 501; 63 N. Y. S.
642; aff'd, 169 N. Y. 589; 62 N. E. 1097; Willets v. Haines,

Lead Co., 162 App. Div. 766, 769; 147 N. Y. S. 989; Paff
v. Kinney, 1 Bradf. 1, 9), where a judicial settlement of
accounts is conclusive as to the past, but is never ultimate in the sense that it relieves the fiduciary from
liability for the future. See also Hazlett v. Estate of
'Cf. 14 Halsbury, Laws of England, 2d ed., pp. 171, 269, 287, 288,

48 Ohio St. 545, 551; 28 N. E. 670. On the other hand,
there are states where by express provision of the statutes
the executor is to be discharged upon a showing of full
administration, and others where the requirement of a
discharge has been read into the statutes by a process of
construction.'
The courts of Illinois, as we interpret their opinions,
maintain a middle ground, which is neither that of the
common law on the one side nor its opposite on t'he other.

support will be found for the strict rule of the common
law if what has been said in some of the opinions is taken
from its fiamework and consicjered without reference to
what was actually decided. See, e. g.. Starr v. Willoughby,
218 Ill. 485, 493; 75 N. E. 1029., The aspect becomes different, however, when attention is directed-to the setting
of the facts and to the provisions and implications of
the applicable statutes. What emerges, it would seem, is
this: A discharge upon an accounting will be vacated in
a direct proceeding if it appears that there were assets,
not inventoried by the executor nor included in his report,
for which, when the decree was passed, he was properly
accountable (Fraserv. Fraser,149 Ill. App. 186, 187, 195,
196; cf. Musick v. Beebe, 17 Kan. 47, 53, 54): in the
absence ?f such a showing, the discharge when decreed
upon a finding of full administration will relieve the executor fot the future of responsibility and power. Cf.
Reizer v. Mertz, 223 Ill, 555, 562, 564; 79 N. E. 283;

Z6 Ill. App. 55, 58, holds that a surety is liable on an executor's bond
where a balance available for creditors was wrongfully distributed;
Starr v Willoughby, 218 Ill. 485, 492; 75 N. E. 1029, holds that a
power in trust, unrelated to the office of executor, will survive a decree which purports to discharge him; and Maguire v. City of Macomb, 293 Ill. 441, 453; 127 N. E. 682, is substantially to the same
effect. No casc has been found where an executor whose discharge
had been decreed after a full and fair accounting has been held suable
thereafter in his representative capacity.

Opinion of the Court.

Whatever doubt may survive a reading of the cases is
dispelled or greatly attenuated when we pass to an examination of the statutes and the plan that they reveal.
First in order of importance is the statute regulating
the settlement of accounts.' An executor is required to
exhibit a report of his administration within thirty days
after the expiration of one year from the date of his letters. That being done, he must exhibit a report thereafter, whenever required by the court, "until the duties
of administration are fully completed." He may from
time to time at his own volition file "a final report of
his administration to a specified date," which, even if
approved, will not terminate his office. He may also
make a final report "at the conclusion of administration."' Such a report, if approved upon notice to all
parties in interest, shall be binding upon them "in the
absence of fraud, accident or mistake." A final report
"at the conclusion of administration" assumes that there
is a stage when administration is over. The executor is
functus officio when discharged by the court after that
stage has been attained.
Another statute of high significance is one that makes
provision for an appraisal of the assets.' ° If the executor
discovers after the making of an inventory and appraisal
that the assets of the estate do not exceed the amount of
the widow's allowance, after deducting necessary expenses,
he is to report the facts to the court. Thereupon the
court, if it finds the report to be true, shall order the assets
to be delivered to the widow, " and discharge the executor

or administrator from further duty." Plainly such a discharge is equivalent to a termination of the office. There
is not only exoneration for the past, but absolution for
the future. 1
The decree of the Probate Court discharging this executor must be read against the background of this statutory
scheme. It is too precise in its terms to be dismissed as
amounting to nothing more than a confirmation of the
report as submitted for approval. If words can express
an intention to declare administration ended, the expression is not lacking here. We may not put all this aside
as surplusage. If there was no power in the Illinois court
to give relief so comprehensive, the defect should be very
clear before a federal court will undertake to wrest the
words of the decree from their natural and ordinary
meaning or hold them to be futile. Especially is that so
in view of the growing tendency of probate courts
throughout the land to break the shackles of the ancient
rule. Weighty considerations of expediency and justice
explain this tendency and support it. In the thought of
many judges, an executor discharged after a full and fair
accounting is no longer to be vexed by the annoyance and
expense of defending fruitless suits with assets no longer
available for reimbursement or indemnity. If suitors or
tax-gatherers wish to go against the estate or against those
who have shared in it, they must either vacate the decree upon a showing of assets unaccounted for, or procure
upon a showing of necessity the appointment of an administrator, or pass over the estate and its representatives
and pursue the..legatees to the extent of benefits received.
There was no attempt to tread those paths, though the
last at all events was open.
Still

Another inroad upon the common-law rule is made by a stat-

ute allowing an executor to resign whenever it appears to the court
that a resignation is proper. Laws of 1872, p. 77, at p. 88, § 40; now

Revised Statutes, 1935, c. 3, § 41.

Syllabus.

The controversy in this aspect is one of local law,
which, once it is ascertained, must be accepted as controlling. Security Trust Co. v. Black River National
Bank, supra; Forrest v. Jack, 294 U. S. 158; Seabury v.
Green, 294 U. S. 165. The decree discharging the executo, s amounts to a construction of the Illinois statute by a
court of the state, and a court of special competence and
experience in disposing of such questions. There being
no satisfactory showing that the decision overpasses the
bounds of jurisdiction, we yield to its authority.
The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed
and the order of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF WISCONSIN.

No. 55. Argued November 18, 19, 1935.-Decided December 9, 1935.
1. The Federal Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933, § 5 (i), as amended,
must be construed as providing that any state building and loan
association which has become a member of a Federal Home Loan
Bank by subscribing to its shares, may convert itself into a Federal Savings and Loan Association upon the vote of a baremajority of its members and without the consent of the State that
created it. P. 332.
This construction is corroborated by a comparison of the Act
in its present form with its form before amendment, and with
other analogous legislation. P. 333.
2. Courts cannot ignore the plain meaning of a statute in order to

avoid a decision upon its validity, P. 334.
