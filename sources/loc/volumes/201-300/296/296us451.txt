APPEAL

from an order quashing an indictment charging

fraudulent use of the mails. See 4 F. Supp. 662.
Mr. Walter Brower, with whom Solicitor General Reed,
Assistant Attorney General Keenan, and Messrs. Lee A.
Jackson and W. Marvin Smith were on the brief, for the
United States.
Mr. John W. Davis, with whom Mr. Theodore W. Brazeau was on the brief, for appellees.
PER CURIAM.

Defendants were indicted in the Uni~d States District
Court for the Eastern District of Wi~consin for violations of ยง 215 of the Criminal Code, relating to fraudulent
use of the mails. 18 U. S. C. 338. Under order of the
court the Government filed a bill of particulars. 4 F.
Supp. 662. Defendants then moved to quash the indictment. The motion was based upon the indictment, the
bill of particulars, and an affidavit of. defendants' counsel.
The affidavit was an argumentative review of the bill of

296 U.S.

particulars for the purpose of showing that in view of
its statements the Government would be "unable to make
a case." The court granted the motion to quash, and the
Government brought this appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U. S. C. 682. Defendants' motion to dismiss
the appeal was postponed to the hearing on the merits.
The District Judge rendered no opinion, but certified
that his "decision and order quashing the indictment
herein were not based in any respect upon the invalidity
or construction of section 215 of the Criminal Code upon
which the indictment in said cause is founded."
We find no basis for the contention that defendants'
motion to quash was in substance a "special plea in bar"
within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act. See
United States v. Storrs, 272 U. S. 652, 654; United States
v. Murdock, 284 U. S. 141, 147. The motion and the
affidavit in its support challenged the sufficiency of the
indictment in the light of the bill of particulars. As it
does not appear that the decision of the District Judge
was based upon the construction or invalidity of the statute upon which the indictment is founded, and as it may
well be that the decision was based upon the construction
of the indictment and its insufficiency as a pleading, this
Court is without jurisdiction of the appeal. United States
v. Carter, 231 U. S. 492, 493, 494; ,United States v. Moist,
231 U. S. 701, 702; United States v. Colgate & Co., 250
U. S. 300, 301, 302; United States v. Hastings, ante, p. 188.
Dismissed.
