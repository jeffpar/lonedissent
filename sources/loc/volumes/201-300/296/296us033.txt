This suit, under the Urgent Deficiencies Act, October

answered. The District Court dismissed the bill. The
case is here on appeal.
The plaintiff is the company formed to take over, under

the properties of the Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic
Railway, upon its reorganization. Reorganization and

transfer-to it of all the common stock, to guarantee 5 -per
cent. dividends on the preferred and to agree to extingis all prior liens on the property, which aggregated
$4,248,413.76. gee United States v. Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R. Co., 282 U. S.522.

Opinion of the Court.

The accounting rules promulgated by the Commission
July 1, 1914, pursuant to § 20 6f the Interstate Commerce Act, provide generally that the investment account shall show the "actual money costs" to the "accounting carrier "; and specifically . as- to Account 41 ,
"Cost of Road Purchased ":
"This account shall include the 'cash cost of any road
or portion, thereof pu'rchased. . . . Where the consideration given for the property purchased is other than cash,
such consideration- shall be valued on a current cash
basis."
In opening its books of account as of January 1, 1927,
the company contended that the value of "Road and
Equipment" must be ascertained, in the usual manner;
and that the value should be entered at $24,010,135.47, "
which amount was (with net additions made thereafter)
the final single'sum value of the properties as of June 30,"
1914, found by the Commission in its report made in the
Valuation Proceeding (75 I. C. C. 645) in 1923; and it
presented to the Commission the following balance sheet:
Assets:
Account 701-Road and Equipment......... $24, 010,135.47
Other Assets..........................
.2,698,817.73
Total ....... I......................... $26,708,953.20
Liabilities:
Account 751-Capital stock account:
Preferred stock .....................
$5, 180,300.00
Common stock:.....................
21, 528, 653.20
Total...........................

$26, 708,953.20

The Commission refused to approve the balance sheet
proposed. Reorganization and Control of Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic Ry., '1581. C. C; 6. It insisied that
the item "Road and Equipment" be reduced to $6,729,896.03 and that the item "Common Stock" be reduced
to $4,248,413.76; and it held that these reductions were

required by the following condition incorporated in the
order of December 21, 1926, which authorized the issue of
the stock.
'.'Provided,however, and authority to issue said stock
is granted upon the express condition, that, for the purposes of the accounting, as provided in the classiication
of investment in road and equipment in the text of account 41, 'Cost of road purchased,' the cash value of the
preferred stock issued must, in stating the transactions in
the accounts, be reckoned on a -basis not in excess of its
par value; and that the cash value of the common stock
must be reckoned on a basis not in excess of the amount
received therefor."
The company then brought the suit described in United
States v. Atlantic, Birmingham & Coast R. Co., 282 U. S.
522. The District Court sustained in that case the plaintiff's claim; but we held that its decree must be reversed
and the bill dismissed for lack of. jurisdiction, since no
order requiring the accounting had been -entered by the
Commission.'
Thereafter, on March 26, 1932, the Commission instituted, of.its own motion, an enquiry into the methods
to be employed by the company in accounting for its
liability for capital stock and for its investment in road
and equipment. The company renewed the contentions
theretofore made by it. Much evidence bearing upon
the value of the properties was introduced both by it
and by the Commission. On June 9, 1934, the Commission entered the ordri here under review, accompanied
by an elaborate report. It adhered to the view that the
condition contained in the order of December 21, 1926,
required that the common stock liability be limited to
$4,248,413.76 and the value of "Road and Equipment"
In that case, the applicable statutes, and the Commission's rules
governing the accounting involved, are set forth in detail.

be set at $6,729,896.03. But it nevertheless made a valuation of the properties based on the evidence introduced;
and it added an independent ground for its decision: that,
upon valuing the properties, it found that the market
or fair cash value of the properties in question did not
exceed the sum of $9,428,713.76, as of January 1., 1927;
that sum being equal to the par value of the preferred
($5,180,300) and $4,248,413.76. The order entered required the company to state its accounts in accordance
with the above findngs.
The plaintiff then brought this suit, claiming that the
valuation thus made by the Commission is arbitrary, unreasonable, unsupported by the evidence, and contrary
to the evidence; and that it is void, among other reasonsj
(a) because the Commission's valuation ignores the ele..
ments of value of the property for rate-making purposes;
(b) that it ignores the reproduction value of the properties; and (c) that it violates paragraph 5 (1) of §'19a of
the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended; which declares that "all final valuations by the Commission . . .
shall be prima facie evidence of the value of the property
in all proceedings under the Act."
The pleadings, with exhibits annexed, occupy 155 pages
of the printed record in this Court; the narrative statement of the evidence 154 pages; and there are 15 other
exhibits, most of them extensive. Besides, -there is a
stipulation of counsel by which reference may be made
to much other evidence, including that in various proceedings before the Commission and in the federal courts
concerning the properties now vested in 2the company and
its relations to the Atlantic Coast Line.

Opinion of the Court.

296 U. S.

The District Court, in dismissing the bill, declared that
it was unnecessary to pass. upon the- soundness of -the
groundoriginally taken by the Commission, since, on the
..evidence in the proceeding under review, it had made. a
valuation of the properties as of January 1, 1927; had
.made that valuation an, independent ground of its decision and order; and had appraised the properties "at
such a value as that subtraction of the par of the preferred
,stock. gives the same figures for the common stock as
were reached originally by the Commission." The Court
added: "We do not discover any breach of law in arriving at the value. As a finding of fact it is binding in
this court. In either view of the transaction of reorganization, the figure set up by the Commission in the attacked order is unassailable." We agree with the District
Court.:
This Court is without power to weigh the evidence.
Virginian Ry. v. United States, 272 U. S. 658, 665. The
report of the Commission (201 I. C. C. 645-671) makes
it clear that there was ample evidence to support its finding and order. It -appeared, among other things, that the
railroad had been an enterprise peculiarly disastrous to
investors; that for the period from 1916 to 1926 the operati ng expenses had largely exceeded the operating revenues; that the net railway operating income for the year
1926 was the highest since 1917; and that these earnings,
if capitalized at 5 per cent., wduld indicate a value of
.only $2,908,300. The Commission concluded that "an
immediate measure of value ,of the non-par stock would
be the amount contemporaneously paid and agreed to be
paid for it by the Coast Line Company." (201 I. C. C.
665.) In reaching its conclusion, it considered the report

filed in 1923 in the Valuation Proceeding, and also the
evidence as to the cost of reproduction, and said:
"Clearly, the only pertinent value is that for purposes of
sale or exchange. Cost of reproduction is to be given
little, if any, weight in determining such value, in the
absence of evidence thaf a reasonably prudent man would

REVENUE, v. ST. LOUIS UNION TRUST CO.
ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

No. 25.

Argued October 24, 25, 1935.-Decided November 11, 1935.

1. Some years before his death, decedent conveyed property in trust
to pay' the income to his daughter during her life, with remainder over to persons named. The indenture also provided (1)
that'if the trustee should exercise a discretionary power given him
to terminate the trust, or (2) the daughter should die before the
grantor did, the property should be.transferred, to the grantor, to
be his absolutely. Neither of the contingencies had taken place
when "the grantor died. Held that the transfer was not "intended
to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,"'
within the meaning of § 302 (c), Revenue Act of 1924. P. 40.
2. That wbich gives rise to the estate tax. laid by § 301 (a) of the
Revenue Act of 1924, is the death of the decedent, with the resulting transfer of his estate, either by will or the law relating to intestacy. When, therefore, § 302 (c) includes within the purview of § 301 (a) a transfer inter vivos "intended to take effect
in possession or enjoyment at or after his death," it does so upon
the thebry that such a transfer in effect is testamentary-that is
to say, a substitute for either a disposition by will or a passing in
virtue of intestacy. P. 41.
3. In this case the grantor had retained no right in the trust estate
which was the subject of testamentary disposition; and his death
