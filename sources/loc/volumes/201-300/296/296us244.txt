v. UNITED STATES.

CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF CLAIMS.

No. 30.

Argued November 12, 1935.-Decided December 9, 1935.

1. The Act of May 26, 1920, conferring jurisdiction on the Court of
Claims to adjudicate all claims of the Klamath etc. Tribes of Indians against the United States, should not be tonstrued as embracing a claim which they settled with the Government long before
and of which they gave a valid- release, even though the consideration for the release was grossly inadequate. Pp. 249-252.
2. The failure of the Indians, between the settlement in 1909, and
this suit in 1925, to seek further payment, and their omission to
mention the demand-a very large one--when seeking the passage
of the jurisdictional Act, though they specified others, makes
strongly against the contention that the Act was intended to cover
this claim. P. 249.
3. An Act granting a special privilege is to be strictly construed- and
may not by implication be extended to cases not plainly within
its terms. P. 250.
4. It is significant that earlier Acts, which were intended to waive
settlements, employed terms quite different from those of the Act
above mentioned. P. 251.
5. To bring their claim within the jurisdictional Act, the claimants
were under the burden of proving in the Court of Claims that
the release was invalid, and of showing in this Court that, as a
matter of law, the facts found compel that conclusion. P. 252.
6. Congress has untrammeled power to fix as it deems appropriate and
just under the circumstances, the compensation that shall be paid
an Indian tribe for the taking of part of its reservation. P. 252.
7. An Act appropriating a sum to the credit of Indians declared
that it was not to be effective until the Indians "through the
usual channels" had executed a release of any claims against the
United States for certain land of their reservation of which the
Government had disposed. A release was given and accepted,
which served to make the appropriation effective. Held that, in
the absence of findings of fact requiring a conclusion to the contrary, it is to be presumed that all things necessary to make the
release valid were done regularly as" required by tlhe Act. P. 253.

8. Duress in procuring the release will not be inferred from incomplete, doubtful or ambiguous findings. P. 253.
9. A release of a claim given by Indian Tribes in accordance with
an Act of Congress appropriating the money received by them in
settlement can not be avoided by the courts upon the ground that
the amount paid was grossly inadequate. The obligation of the
United States to make good their loss is a moral one calling for
action by Congress. P. 254.

kERTIORARi, 295 U. S. 729, to review a, judgment

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This suit was brought under an Act of May 26, 1920,1
conferring jurisdiction of claims asserted by plaintiffs
against the defendant. It provides:" That all claims of
whatsoever nature" the plaintiffs may have against the
United States "which have not heretofore been determined by the Court of Claims" may be submitted to that
court for determination of the amount, if any, "due said
Indians from the United States under any treaties, agreemerts, or laws of Congress, or for the misappropriation of
any of the funds of said Indians, or for the failure of the
United States to pay said Indians any money or other
property due; and jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon
the Court of Claims, with the right of either party to
appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, to
'41 Stat. 623.

hear and determine all legal and equitable claims, if any,
of said Indians, against the United States, and to enter
judgment thereon " (§ 1); that if any claim be submitted
to said courts they shall settle the rights therein, both
legal and equitable, "notwithstanding lapse of time or
statutes of limitation, and any payment which may have
been made upon any claim so submitted shall not be
pleaded as an estoppel, but may be pleaded as an offset in
such suits or actions . . ." § 2.
The claim in suit is for the value of plaintiffs' rights in
respect of about 87,000 acres, which, less an admitted
payment, is alleged to be $5,891,250. The answer is a
general traverse. At the trial much evidence was taken
and the contentions of the parties were fully presented.
The court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions
of law and dismissed the case.
The questions for decisions are:
Whether, assuming that before its passage plaintiffs
gave defendant a valid release of the claim in suit, the
Act empowers the court to adjudicate that claim.
Whether the facts found are sufficient to show that the
release given is invalid.
The findings are sufficiently reflected by the following
narration. In 1864 plaintiffs held by immemorial possession more than 20,000,000 acres located within what now
constitutes Oregon and California. By an Act 2 of March
25 of that year the President was authorized to conclude
with them a treaty for the purchase of the country they
occupied. The treaty was made October 14 following.'
A proviso sets apart a tract within the ceded country, to
be held until otherwise directed by the President, as a
residence for plaintiffs, with specified privileges. Rights

of way for public roads were reserved.' Shortly before
the treaty was made Congress granted Oregon, to aid in
the construction of a road from the city of Eugene to the
eastern boundary of the State, the odd-numbered sections for three in width on each side of the proposed
road.' Oregon accepted the grant and assigned it to a
road company which undertook to construct the road.
Congress recognized the assignment.' Patents were issued to the State and to the road company for in all
420,240.67 acres, title to which was later acquiired by a
land company. Exclusive of right of way, 111,385 acres
so acquired by that company were within the boundaries
of the reservation and had been allotted in severalty to
members of the tribe.
The Act of March 2, 1889,' directed suit by the United
States to forfeit the grants for non-compliance with the
specified conditions, saving, however, the rights of bona
fide purchasers. The company's title was held valid.

ground that.by the terms of the grant they were expressly
excepted. But, as that issue could have been raised in
the first suit, it was held res adjudicata. United States v.
California& Oregon Land Co., 192 U. S. 355.
The Secretary of the Interior reported the result of the
litigation and expressed the opinion that the Indians
should have compensation. Congress by an Act of June
21, 1906,8 authorized the Secretary to exchange unallotted
lands in the reservation for the allotted lands earlier con16 Stat. 708.

veyed. The Secretary made an agreement with the land
company pursuant to which on August 22, 1906, it conveyed the 111,385 acres back to the-United States and in
return the latter conveyed 87,000 acres of unallbotted lands
to the company. That transfer was made without the
knowledge or consent of laintiffs and without giving
them any compensation for the lands so taken from their
reservation.
As found below, the value of plaintiffs' title was then
$2,980,000.' An Act of April 30, 1908,0 appropriated
$108,750 to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of
the Indians and to be expended for their benefit. A
proviso declares: "That this appropriation shall not be
effective until said Indians, through the usual channels,
shall execute a release of any claims and demands of
every kind against the United States for the land involved."
The Indian population on the reservation was then
1,038, including 640 adults of whom 287 were men. The
adult males alone were allowed to vote in Indian councils.
The superintendent called a council to assemble at the
general agency on December 5, 1908, for the purpose of
considering compliance with the Act. The Indians were
by the superintendent given timely notice in the usual
way. The council, assembled in pursuance of the notice,
was attended by 200 or more Indians. The superintendent presided and through an interpreter explained the
terms of the measure and what would have to be done
to get the appropriated money. There was some opposition, but the release was signed by 100 or more Indians
present. The superintendent "neither did nor said anything to mislead the assembly." Forty or fifty miles from
'The court allowed counterclaims set up by defendant amounting
to $1,978,431.24.

the general agency there was a sub-agency at Yainax.
The Indians in that section rarely attended councils at
the general agency headquarters. The superintendent
called another council at that place. In general the proceedings were the same as before; at that meeting others
signed. In the end the release was signed by 150 adult
males of the tribes on the reservation.
January 6, 1909, the Secretary received the release from
the superintendent. In form it complied with the requirements of the Act and concluded: "Now, 1herefore,
the undersigned, being a majority of the Indians of the
Klamath Reservation in council assembled, do hereby
relinquish any and all claims and demands of every kind
and character which they now have or may hereafter have
a.gainst the United States for the lands involved." The
Secretary accepted it as sufficient compliance with the
Act, and accordingly $108,750 was placed in the Treasury
to the credit of the plaintiffs. Except by the petition in
this suit, they have made no claim for additional compensation.
1. The jurisdictional Act is a special law passed for the
benefit of plaintiffs upon consideration of their application for relief. Their memorial specified other claims but
made no reference to the one before us. There is nothing
in what they presented (see H. Rep. NQ. 672, 66th Cong.,
2d Sess., p. 8), the reports of the committees or the Act
itself to identify, or to indicate that they wanted to have
determined, any claim for compensation for their right
to the 87,000 acres conveyedby the United States to the
land company. Their failure, between the settlement in
1909 and the suit in 1925, to seek further payment and
their omission to mention this very large demand, when
seeking congressional action in their favor, makes strongly
against their contention that the jurisdictional Act was
intended to cover this claim. Cf. United States v. Creek
Nation, 295 U. S. 103, 108-109.

OCTOBER TERM, 1935.
Opinion of the Court.

296 U.S.

The meaning of the general language of § 1 that "all
claims of whatsoever nature" which plaintiffs have
against the United States "may be submitted" is limited by the clause "which have not heretofore been determined by the Court of Claims," and is further much
narrowed by the definitions of the classes of claims meant
to be included. And correspondingly restrained is the
meaning of the phrase "all legal and equitable claims"
in the clause conferring jurisdiction upon the court " to
hear and determine." Thus the privilege of plaintiffs
to submit and the power of the court to determine are
made coextensive. The Act grants a special privilege
to plaintiffs and is to be strictly construed and may not
by implication be extended to cases not plainly within
its terms. Schillinger v. United States, 155 U. S. 163,
166. Price v. United States and Osage Indians, 174 U. S.
373, 375. Blackfeather v. United States, 190 U. S. 368,
376.
This claim is plainly not, within the meaning of § 1,
for an amount due under treaty, agreement or law of
Congress or for misappropriation of funds of the Indians.
Plaintiffs maintain that it is covered by the clause: "for
the failure of the United States to pay said Indians any
money or other property due." There is here involved no
question as to the adequacy of that language to cover any
of the claims referred to in plaintiffs' application to the
Congress; we are considering whether it extends to this
claim assuming that prior to the enactment it had been
effectively released. If the release stands, no money or
property is due plaintiffs, for the settlement and release
wiped out the claim. If the Act is sufficient to give jurisdiction of this claim, then it permits plaintiffs to bring
into the Court of Claims for determination de novo all
claims, whether released or not, that they ever had against
the United States, excepting only those already there determined. It goes without saying that, if Congress in-

244

Opinion of the Court.

tended to grant so sweeping and unique a privilege, it
would have made that purpose unmistakably plain. As
shown in the opinion below, Acts intended to waive settlements employ terms quite different from the provisions

under consideration. 1'
Plaintiffs turn for support to the provision of § 2 which
prevents "payment . . . upon any claim" from being
pleaded as an estoppel but permits it to be asserted as an
offset. And they insist that, if this clause does not relate
to payments made and accepted as being in full. it means
nothing. But that contention is based on a misunderstanding of the language used. Payment upon a claim
means payment on account or in part as distinguished
from one made and accepted as payment in full. The

quoted provision made no grant of jurisdiction; it was
inserted merely to eliminate defenses. Neither it nor
any other part of § 2 may be held to add claims to those
"For instances where Congress authorized submission to the Court
of Claims of Indian claims theretofore rettled or adjusted, see Act of
February 7, 1925, 43 Stat. 812, as amended March 3, 1927, 44 Stat.

covered by the language of § 1. As jurisdiction will not
be extended beyond the terms of the Act by any implication or other resort to construction, no force can be given
to plaintiffs' suggestion that intention to include claims
already' settled and released is shown by the clause in
§ 2 allowing defendant credit for money it expended for
plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs say the committees recommended inclusion
of a released claim and suggest that therefore the intention of Congress was to include the one in suit. Plaintiffs brought that claim forward; it arose under the Treaty
of October 14, 1864, and involved questions concerning
boundaries of the reservation meant to be defined by the
treaty and boundaries as attempted to be established by
surveys, and whether the release referred to extends to
the area in respect -of which the claim is asserted. The
circumstances attending the enactment might be thought
to have favorable bearing as to that claim. But as shown
above plaintiffs' failure to disclose that it had and wanted
to submit the claim in suit supports defendant's contention
that the court below was without jurisdiction.
2. Have plaintiffs shown the release invalid?
The question is not whether under the circumstances
disclosed the United States may set up the release as
a defense. It is whether the special Act brings the claim
within the court's jurisdiction. As this claim, if released,
is not covered, it follows that in the court below the burden was on plaintiffs to prove the absence of valid release,
and that here their burden is to show that, as a matter
of law, the facts fouid compel the conclusion that the release given is not valid. It is to be remembered that the
Act of April 30, 1908, was passed by Congress in the exertion of its untrammeled power in behalf of the United
States to fix, as it deems appropriate and just under the
circumstances, the amount of compensation to be paid
the Indians for the rights of the plaintiffs lost by the tak-

ing of the 87,000 acres from their reservation. Cherokee
Nation v. Hitchcock, 187 U. S. 294, 306, 308. Lone Wolf
v. Hitchcock, 187-U. S. 553, 565-566. Choate v. Trapp,
224 U. S. 665, 670-671. Cf. United States v. Mille Lac
Chippewas, 229 U. S. 498, 506, 509-510. United States
v. Creek Nation, supra, 110. They gave, and through the
Secretary of the Interior the United States accepted, the
release as sufficient to comply with the Act. It served
to make the appropriation effective and was treated as
fulfillment of the conditions upon which the money was
paid into the Treasury to be disbursed from time to time
for plaintiffs' benefit. In the absence of findings of fact
requiring conclusion to the contrary, it is to be presumed
that all things necessary to make the appropriation effective and the release valid were done regularly and in
accordance with the expressed will of Congress. United
States v. Chemical Foundation,272 U. S. 1, 14-15.
The phrase "through the usual channels" is used in
stating the condition without which payment would not
have been made. There the expression is one of indefinite import. It does not necessarily mean the manner
in which plaintiffs or other or all of the Indian tribes
were then accustomed to make treaties or to negotiate
other agreements with the United States. For aught
that appears in the Act or findings of the court, "usual
channels" may have been used to signify something less
than the proceedings, if any there were, usually followed
by plaintiffs or Indian tribes generally. If this ambiguous phrase be held to require adherence to custom, there
is nothing in the findings to show what the custom was.
They fail to show that anything required by the Act was
oraitted.
Plaintiffs contend that the release is invalid because
obtained by duress. But duress will not be presumed;
nor will it be inferred from incomplete, doubtful or ambiguous findings. There is nothing to suggest that, in

the making of the settlement, anything was done to overreach plaintiffs. On the contrary, the circumstances disclosed by the findings tend quite strongly to indicate that.
the negotiations were fairly conducted.
Plaintiffs say that the plain inadequacy of the payment, when taken in connection with the unequal positions of the parties, is enough without more to invalidate
the release. The findings show that the amount paid
plaintiffs was less than four per cent. of the value of the
land. It was grossly inadequate. Where, in litigation
between private parties, a release of claim is by the party
who gave it challenged as invalid, inadequacy of consideratidn coupled with lack of business capacity and inferiority of position in respect of the transaction or in relation to that of the other party are elements having sig-nificance. Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. 55, 82. Thorn
Wire Co. v. Washburn & Moen Co., 159 U. S. 423, 443.
But the rules that govern in such cases have no application in suits by these Indian tribes against the United
States. The relation between them is different from that
existing between individuals whether dealing at arm's
length, as trustees and beneficiaries, or otherwise. See
Choctaw Nation v. United States, 119 U. S. 1, 28. Lone
Wolf v. Hitchcock, ubi supra. Choate v. Trapp, ubi
supra. Regard being had to the nature of duties, resembling those arising out of the relation of guardian and
ward,1 2" owed by the United States to Indian tribes, and
in view of the undoubted power of Congress to determine
the amount and to fix the terms of payment of compensation for the rights lost to plaintiffs, it is clear that, in
the absence of specific authorization, they may not avoid
the release given in accordance with the Act upon the
United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383-384. Choctaw Nation v. United States, 119 U. S. 1, 27, 28. Jones v. Meehan, 175

ground that the payment was too small. That would
enable them to question the laws of Congress in fields
where, because of the relationship referred to, they are
supreme.
The obligation of the United States to make good plaintiffs' loss is a moral one calling for action by Congress in
accordance with what it shall determine to be right. Save
to the extent that Congress may authorize, the Government's dealings with Indian tribes are not subject to judicial review."8 Even if judicially cognizable, as would be
a like contention in ordinary litigation between individuals, plaintiffs' insistence that inadequacy of consideration
invalidates the release could not here be sustained. That
is so because the findings fail to show that any person
acting for the United States deceived or misled plaintiffs
as to the value of the land or, indeed, had knowledge of
any fact bearing upon its value that was not well known
by plaintiffs when they made the settlement and gave
the release. Mere inadequacy of consideration is not
enough. Eyre v. Potter, 15 How. 42, 59. Pomeroy,
Equity Jurisprudence, 14th ed., § 926. Williston on Contracts, § 115.
As the Act does not extend to this claim if released, and
as the facts found fail to establish invalidity of the release admittedly given, the jurisdictional Act does not
extend to the claim in suit and the Court of Claims rightly
dismissed the case. If plaintiffs are to have additional
compensation, it must be obtained through legislation
dealing with the merits or authorizing effective judicial
determination.
Affirmed.
