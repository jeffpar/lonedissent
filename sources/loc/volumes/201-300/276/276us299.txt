MITCHELL ET AL. v. HAMPEL ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
FIFTH CIRCUIT.

No. 269.

Argued March 2, 1928.-Decided March 19, 1928.

When a creditor holds an obligation of a bankrupt firm upon which
members of the partnership have, as joint principals or sureties,
made themselves individually liable, he is entitled, under the Bankruptcy Law, to prove his claim both against the partnership estate
and the individual estates. P. 302.
18 F. (2d) 3, reversed.

Court of Appeals reversing a decree of the District Court
which had permitted Mitchell, as County Treasurer, to
prove a claim of the County against a bankrupt firm of
bankers, with which its funds were deposited, and also
against members of the firm individually. Hampel et al.
were trustees in bankruptcy.

Argument for Respondents.

276 U. S.

Mr. E. B. Colgin, with whom Mr. Lewis R. Bryan was
on the brief, for respondents.
The so-called American rule allowing double proof is
an artificial offshoot born of a. technical analysis of the
old equity rule of marshalling of assets. Its effect is
unjust enrichment at the expense of the partnership creditor. It is too technical, artificial and unjust to find favor
in a court of equity. Swartz v. Siegel, 117 Fed. 13; In
re Faulkshire, 153 Fed. 503; Adams v. Hoyt Co., 164
Fed. 489.
The Circuit Court of Appeals properly determined the
rights of the parties to a non-negotiable contract, an indemnity bond wholly the creature of the statutory law of
the State of Texas, in accordance with the law of the
State of Texas. Myers v. International Trust Co., 273
U. S. 382; Fourth Nat'l Bank v. Mead, 216 Mass. See
also Bayne v. Cusimano, 50 La. Ann. 361; Nashville
Saddlery Co. v. Green, 127 Miss. 98; 30 Cyc. 455.
Under the law of the State, the members of the copartnership were jointly and severally liable to the credi.tors of the firm, and they could not make themselves individually liable in contradistinction from their individual
liability as such members of the firm by attempting to become sureties on their co-partnership bond, the debt
created by the bond being exclusively for the benefit of
the partnership. Vernon's Sayles' Civil Statutes, 1914,
Art. 6147; Rev. Stats. of Texas, 1925, Art. 6111; Fowler
Commission Co. v. Land & Co., 248 S.W. 314; Bank v.
Cup & Co., 59 Tex. 268; Laning v. Bank, 36 S.W. 481.
In refusing to allow the double proof, the court below
prevented an inequitable preference and secured to all
creditors an "equitable distribution of the property of
the several estates" as intended by the Bankruptcy Act,

MITCHELL v. HAMPEL.
299

Opinion of the Court.

Under the present Bankruptcy Act, double proof is
allowable only where a creditor holds two distinct obligations, (a) the obligation of the firm as such, and (b) the
obligation of the individual not linked with the partnership transactions, and therefore independent in character.
LaMoylle County Nat'l Bank v. Stevens, 107 Fed. 245;
In re Mosier, 112 Fed. 138; In re Kendrick & Co., 226
Fed. 978; Texas L. & C. Co. v. Carroll & Iler, 63 Tex. 51;

Mon. 8; McKee v. Hamilton, 33 Ohio St. 7; Weaver v.
Tapscott, 9 Leigh, 424.
That double proof is dependent on the laws of the State
where the contract is made and to be performed, see:
Myers v. International Trust Co., 273 U. S. 382; Chapman v. Bowen, 207 U. S. 88; Robinson v. Seaboard, etc.,
247 Fed. 667; In re Jarmoulouski, 287 Fed. 703; In re
McCoy, 150 Fed. 106; Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U. S.
28; Fourth Nat'l Bank v. Mead, 216 Mass. 52.
The Bankruptcy Act does not suspend the laws of any
State, but merely substitutes its own form of procedure
and administration. Reynolds v. New York Trust Co.,
106 Fed. 613; Hiscock v. Varick Bank, 206 U. S. 28.
MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the

Court.
J. H. P. Davis & Co. of Fort Bend County, Texas,
partners, were adjudicated bankrupts both as a firm and
individually. They were bankers and depositories of
County funds. As such they had given two joint and
several bonds both signed by the firm in its firm name
as principal and by some of the members of the firm

individually, with others, as sureties. The County sought
to prove its claim, not only against the firm but also
against the separate estates of the surviving members, all
of whom had bound themselves severally as well as jointly.
The double proof was allowed by the District Court but
was disallowed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on the
ground that the Bankruptcy Act, ยง 5f, by appropriating
the individual estate of a partner to his individual debts,
excluded by implication debts that were also debts of the
partnership from sharing with the former on equal terms.
Act of July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 548. C. Tit. II, c. 3,
ยง23. 18F. (2d) 3.
We are of opinion that the District Court was right.
Except so far as the statute may prevent it, a solvent man
dealing with another for money to be advanced to or
deposited with his firm may determine the security to
be given as he and the other may agree. He may mortgage his private estate, and we perceive no reason why
he may not create a claim against it in bankruptcy by
a separate contract of his own. The firm creditors know
that they will be postponed to individual creditors, and
that they have'no voice or knowledge as to who the individual creditors shall be, or what the amount of their
claims. The only real equity is not to disturb the equilibrium established by the parties. Those who take less
security have no claim to be put on a footing with those
who require more. It is not necessary to go into nice
speculations as to what a partner can add to the liability
already incurred when he offers a separate contract in
addition to that which is made by his firm. We may
assume that by the firm contract he is bound to the uttermost farthing-but he is bound only as a member of the
firm, and therefore subject to the bankruptcy rule. His
creditor may require more, and we can see nothing to
hinder his putting himself in the position of a separate

debtor also. Certainly we find no prohibition in the
bankruptcy law. Myers v. International Trust Co., 273
U. S. 380. By making a separate contract, although in
the same instrument, he calls the separate liability into
being, as presumably he intends to and as he has a right
to do. Robinson v. Seaboard National Bank of New
York, 247 Fed. 667, 668, 669, Ibid, 1007. The intent and
transaction are not illegal in Texas. Their specific effect
depends on the Bankruptcy Act.
We have dealt with the only question which induced
the granting of the writ. It does not appear to us necessary to go into further details.

v. JONES, ADMINISTRATOR.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS.

No. 349.

Argued March 8, 1928.-Decided March 19, 1928.

An experienced car inspector was found dead with his lantern, at
night, between a track on which a freight train was being made up

and the main track parallel to it, over which a train, by which he
was probably killed, had passed with much noise and a bright
light, but with bell silent, twenty minutes before his body was
discovered. He was last seen alive twenty minutes before the train
passed. There were indications that there was nothing to inspect
at the time when the accident occurred.
Held, that a verdict of damages based on the assumption that
he was engaged in inspecting the freight cars, relying on the customary ringing of the bell, and so absorbed in his work that he did
not hear the approaching train, was mere guess-work. P. 304.
