Northside Company to engage in interstate commerce,
if by doing so it violated any law of the United States.
Compare Cleveland, Cincinnati,Chicago, & St. Louis Ry.
Co. v. UnTited States, 275 U. S. 404. Here, there was as yet
no threat to use the line in interstate commerce; and it
was shown that the line could not possibly be so used
until completed. There was clearly no imminent danger
that irreparable injury would result from its mere construction. Under these circumstances, to deny the injunction and dismiss the bill without prejudice, was, at
least, a permissible exercise of the court's discretion.

MIDLAND VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY v.

BARKLEY

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ARKANSAS.

No. 375.

Argued March 9, 1928.-Decided April 9, 1928.

A railroad, in a time of coal-car shortage, distributed open-top cars
to tipple mines, which can use only that type, and box cars to
wagon mines. The owner of a wagon mine, shipping interstate,
refused box cars and, relying on § 22 of the Interstate Commerce
Act, sued the railroad in the state court for breach of its duty to
furnish cars under the local law. Held that the action would not
lie, since the question at issue was the reasonableness of the carrier's practice of car distribution, which was an administrative
question for the Interstate Commerce Commission. P. 484.
172 Ark. 898, reversed.
CERTIORARI, 275 U. S. 514, to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Arkansas, which affirmed a recovery in an
action against the railroad for failure to furnish coal cars.

Opinion of the Court.

MR. JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Barkley and Burnett operated a wagon coal mine in
Arkansas located about a quarter of a mile from the line
of the Midland Valley Railroad, a corporation of that
State. They shipped their coal by that carrier, largely in
interstate commerce. In the spring and summer of 1922
there was a widespread strike in bituminous coal mines
throughout the United States. When mining was resumed in August, an acute car shortage developed. Coal
is usually shipped in open top cars; and tipple mines,
which are the largest producers of coal, can use only cars
of that type. The supply of these being inadequate, the
Midland, like other carriers, distributed the available open
top cars among the tipple mines and its box cars among
the wagon mines. Barkley and Burnett refused to accept
box cars; and later brought, in an Arkansas court, this
action against the Midland to recover damages for the
alleged failure to furnish, during the period of the car
shortage, an adequate supply of cars. By appropriate
proceedings, the defendant objected to the maintenance
of the action in the state court. It contended that the
proper distribution of coal cars by interstate carriers in
time of car shortage was an administrative question which
Congress had committed to the Interstate Commerce
Commission; and that the plaintiffs should have sought
relief by application to that board. The trial court overruled the objection; the plaintiffs got a verdict; the
judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the highest
court of the State, 172 Ark. 898; and this Court granted
a writ of certiorari. 275 U. S. 514. The only question
for decision is whether the action lies.
The plaintiffs contend, and the state court held, that the
action lay because it was brought to enforce the common
law duty of the carrier to furnish cars, Midland Valley

R. R. Co. v. Hoffman Coal Co., 91 Ark. 180, 189,-a duty
confirmed by the statutes of the State (Crawford & Moses
Arkansas Digest, 1921, § 895), and recognized by the Interstate Commerce Act. They argue that the right to
bring an action in the courts of a State for a breach of
that duty has been specifically preserved to the shipper
by § 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act which declares
that "nothing in this Act contained shall in any way
abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law
or by statute, but the provisions of this Act are in addition to such remedies"; that the plaintiffs made no
attack, open or covert, upon any regulation or order of
the Commission relating to the supply or distribution of
cars, compare Lambert Coal Co. v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R.
Co., 258 U. S. 377; that consequently no administrative
question was involved, compare Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v.
Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U. S. 426; Loomis v. Lehigh
Valley R. R. Co., 240 U. S. 43; Great Northern Ry. Co.
v. Merchants Elevator Co., 259 U. S. 285; and that the
case is governed by Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Puritan
Coal Co., 237 U. S. 121, and Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v.
Sonman Shaft Coal Co., 242 U. S. 120, rather than by
Blaltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. v. PitcairnCoal Co., 215 U. S.
481, and Morrisdale Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co.,
230 U. S.304.
The assertion that no administrative question is here
involved rests upon a misapprehension. It may be assumed that there was no order of the Commission which
required the Midland to distribute all available open top
cars among the tipple mines. But the reasonableness of
the Midland's practice in doing so, and in allotting box cars
to the wagon mines, was the substantial matter in controversy. The right of a shipper to cars is not an absolute
right and the carrier is not liable if its failure to furnish
cars was the result of sudden and great demands which it

had no reason to apprehend would be made and which
it could not reasonably have been expected to meet in full.
The law exacts only what is reasonable from such carriers.
The reasonableness of the rule adopted by the carrier is
a matter for the Commission. Pennsylvania R. R. Co.
v. Puritan Coal Co., 237 U. S. 121, 133, 134. In the case
at bar, the right of the plaintiffs to recover depended
upon whether the defendant's practice of distributing its
open top cars to tipple mines and its box cars to wagon
mines was reasonable. The practice is one which was
generally adopted in times of car shortage by rail carriers
in the same territory; which had, under like circumstances,
been prescribed by general orders of the Director General;' which had been to some extent prescribed by the
Interstate Commerce Commission; ' and the propriety of
which in individual cases has been repeatedly the subject
of consideration by the Commission on applications by
shippers for relief. It was clearly one of those questions
which, as recognized in the Puritan case, calls for "the
IBy an order dated June 17, 1918, the Regional Directors were instructed that "open top. cars suitable and available for loading at
tipple mines should be first supplied to such mines and should not
be supplied to wagon mines until the tipple mines have been supplied." This modified an earlier order of March 20, 1918, which had
directed that open top cars should not be furnished to wagon mines
for loading on public team tracks if box cars were available for such
loading.
2By notice of March 2, 1920, the Commission recommended that
the rules as to the distribution of coal cars embodied in Railroad
Administration Car Service Section Circular CS-31, issued September
12, 1918, revised December 23, 1919, be continued in effect. See In re
Rules Governing Ratings of Coal Mines, 95 I. C. C. 309, 320. This
recommendation appears to have been generally accepted by the carriers. Compare Winding Gulf Colliery Co. v. Virginian Ry. Co., 102
I. C. C. 41. From time to time the Commission has issued emergency
orders governing the distribution of coal cars, under the power conferred by paragraph 15 of § 402 of Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91,

exercise of the regulating function of the Commission."
p. 133. Compare Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co.,
222 U. S. 506.

In the case at bar, the adequacy of the carrier's supply
of open cars in normal times was not seriously questioned;
there was no suggestion that the plaintiffs' mine had been
discriminated against; and the only substantial complaint
was that the Midland's practice in allotting the open top
cars to the tipple mines was illegal. Thus the facts are
unlike those in which actions at law for failure to furnish
cars have been entertained. In PennsylvaniaR. R. Co. v.
PuritanCoal Co., 237 U. S. 121, and in Illinois Central R.
R. Co. v. Mulberry Hill Coal Co., 238 U. S. 275, the claim
was that, under a rule confessedly valid, the carrier had
discriminated against the plaintiff. In Eastern Railway
41 Stat. 456, 476. Several of these orders recognize the necessity of
a distinction, in time of shortage, between wagon and tipple mines.
By Service Order No. 14, issued August 25, 1920, the Commission
directed that on any day when a carrier was unable to supply all
mines on its line with the required open top cars, such cars should not
be furnished to wagon mines which were unable to load on private
tracks and from a tipple or like arrangement, until all tipple mines
had been supplied. This was rescinded by Service Order No. 17,
effective September 19, 1920, which, however, prohibited a carrier
from furnishing open top cars in time of shortage to mines which did
not customarily load cars within 24 hours of the time of placement,
a prohibition which would include most wagon load mines. This
order was vacated March 6, 1921. A similar requirement was incorporated into Service Order No. 25 by Amendment No. 1, effective
October 17, 1922. Service Order No. 25 applied only to common carriers "east of the Mississippi River, including the west bank crossings
thereof"; it was vacated December 11, 1922.

HUMES v. UNITED STATES.
482

Statement of the Case.

Co. v. Littlefield, 237 U. S. 140, the claim was that the
carrier, knowing of the car shortage, had not only failed
to notify the shipper but had accepted the shipment. In
Pennsylvania R. R. Co. v. Sonman Shaft Coal Co., 242
U. S. 120, 125-127, the action was for failure to supply
cars in confessedly normal times. Compare Pennsylvania
R. R. Co. v. Stineman Coal Co., 242 U. S. 298, 300-301.
In none of those cases was the reasonableness of the
carrier's practice in controversy.
We have no occasion to consider whether the then existing orders of the Commission required the Midland to
adopt the practice followed. Nor need we determine,
whether by the amendments of the Interstate Commerce
Act made in Transportation Act, 1920, c. 91, § 402, pars.
10-17, 41 Stat. 456, 476, and the Act of September 22,
1922, c. 413, 42 Stat. 1025, Congress evinced the intention
to occupy the field of regulating the distribution of coal
cars, and thereby abrogated the preexisting limited right
to sue in a state court for failure to supply cars.
Reversed.
