Syllabus.

The lands in dispute were allotted under that section;
and the real controversy here is over its construction. It
is part of a special law put in force with the solicited
assent of the Choctaws and Chickasaws and applicable
only to them. We think it would be understood by the
Indians as meaning that lands allotted under it in the
name of a deceased member should pass to those who
would be his or her heirs according to chapter 49 of
Mansfield's Digest. With that chapter specially designated and chapter 20-the sole basis of the Arkansas law
of curtesy-not mentioned the Indians certainly would
not understand that curtesy was intended. It follows
that § 22 must be construed as intended to pass the full
title free from any claim to curtesy. Marlin v. Lewallen,
ante, p. 58.

TOBACCO GROWERS' CO-OPERATIVE MARKETING ASSOCIATION.
ERROR TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY.

No. 18.

Argued February 23, 1927.-Decided February 20, 1928.

1. A party challenging a judgment of a state court must show that
its enforcement would deprive him, not another, of some right
arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States properly asserted below. P. 88.
2. The power lodged in state courts to conform their proceedings to
reasonable requirements of local law was not abused in this case by
an order striking a part of the answer, based apparently upon the
Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Law, asking the court to determine the validity of the statute here in question and to declare
defendant's rights and duties, and advancing a counterclaim.

P. 88.
3. Semble that the Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Law does not
authorize a defendant to ask judgment by ,counterclaim.. P. 88.

4. This Court has no jurisdiction to review a mere declaratory judgment. P. 89.
5. An answer alleging that the plaintiff is a trust or combination organized for the purpose of creating and carrying out restrictions of
trade unlawfully and contrary to the common law, without mentioning the Constitution or any statute of the United States, does
not raise a federal question. Id.
6. A corporation does not possess the privileges and immunities of a
citizen of the United States within the meaning of the Constitution.
Id.
7. The Co-operative Marketing Act of Kentucky, aiming, in the public interest, to assist agricultural producers in the orderly marketing
of their products and to protect them and consumers from manipulation of prices by middlemen, authorizes the incorporation of
non-profit associations, with membership confined to such producers and with power to contract with their respective members
only for the sale to the corporation of their respective crops of the
products dealt in, during a period of not more than ten years, and
for marketing thereof by the corporation and disposition of the proceeds, less expenses, among the members according to the quantity
and quality of their deliveries. It declares that such an association
shall not be deemed a conspiracy, illegal combination or monopoly;
that such contracts shall not be illegal; that any person knowingly
inducing a breach of such a contract by a member shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor, subject to fine and liable to the association in a
civil suit in the penal sum of $500 for each offense; and that any
warehouseman shall be liable to the association in the same penalty, who, having knowledge or notice of such a contract, persuades
or permits the member who made it to break it, by accepting or
receiving his products for sale or auction contrary to the terms of
such contract. Held:
(1) No right of a warehouse company guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is impaired by merely authorizing corporations,
with membership limited to agriculturalists, and permitting contracts for purchase and resale of farm products. P. 89.
(2) This is also true of the declaration that such associations
shall not be deemed monopolies, combinations, etc., in restraint of
trade, and that contracts with members shall be deemed legal.
The State may declare its own policy in such matters. Id.
(3) There is nothing to show that in Kentucky, since the passage
of the Act, other producers may not form voluntary associations
and make and enforce contracts like those which the Act expressly
authorizes. P. 90.

Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

(4) As the statute does not prescribe more rigorous penalties for
warehousemen than for others who willingly solicit, persuade or
induce a member to Break his marketing contract with his association, a claim that the provision in that regard deprives warehousemen of the equal protection of the laws, is without substantial
basis. Connolly v. Union Pipe Col., 184 U. S. 540, distinguished.
P. 91.
(5) Quaere, whether the liberty protected by the Constitution
includes the right to induce a breach of contract between others for
the aggrandizement of the intermeddler. P. 91.
(6) The statute is of a kind that promotes the common interest,
and provision for protecting the marketing contracts between an
association and its members is essential to its plan; the legislature
was within its powers in providing against probable interference
and to that extent limiting the liberty of contract previously enjoyed by warehousemen. Pp. 92, 96.
8. The liberty of contract guaranteed by the Constitution is freedom
from arbitrary restraint-not immunity from reasonable regulation
to safeguard the public interest. The question is whether the restrictions of the statute have reasonable relation to a proper purpose. P. 97.
9. A provision for a penalty to be received by the aggrieved party as
punishment for the violation of a statute, does not invalidate it. Id.
10. The pleadings in this case allege no burden upon interstate commerce amounting to regulation, nor do they properly and definitely
advance any claim under a federal statute. P. 89.

Since section 27 of the Bingham Act undertakes to
confer upon defendant in error and others of its class
the exclusive right to prosecute a penal action where
no penal offense has been committed, it denies to plaintiff in error the equal protection of the laws.
If the right of recovery be not a penal action, it still
denies to plaintiff in error the equal protection of the
laws, in that it creates an action unknown to the common law, as declared in the case of Chambers &
Marshall v. Baldwin, 91 Ky. 121, and hence is an exclusive privilege.
It denies equal protection of the laws in that it excludes
all individuals and every corporation not organized under
the Bingham Act from the enjoyment of a right of action
for a tort against a third party for inducing or persuading
one of the parties to breach a contract. Atchison, etc.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Argument for Plaintiff in Error.

276 U. S.

Since the Act in question, under regulations therein
prescribed and penalties denounced, forbids warehousemen in all the States of the Union conducting warehouses
in Kentucky from shipping their products of Burley Cooperative Growers into Kentucky for sale at public auction over the floors of loose leaf tobacco warehouses, regardless of the nature of the contracts under which the
shipments are made, or the manner and condition in
which the products are shipped, it follows that it directly
interferes with the transportation, by land or water from
one State to another, which transportation is itself interstate commerce.
If a recovery cannot be had upon a contract which
was made to further the objects of an illegal combination
(Continental Wall Paper Co. v. Lewis Voight, 212 U. S.
227), upon what principle can a recovery be had where
damages are sought against a third party for inducing
the breach of a contract, which, if sued upon, would itself
have been unenforceable?
Total suppression of the trade in the commodity is
not necessary in order to render the combination one
in restraint of trade. It is the effect of the combination
in limiting and restraining the right of each of the members to transact business in the ordinary way, as well as
its effect upon the volume or extent of the dealing in the
commodity, that is regarded. Addyston Pipe Co. v. U. S.,

Commonwealth v. Hatfield Coal Co., 186 Ky. 411; Love
v. Kozy Theatre Co., 193 Ky. 336.
If persons under the same circumstances and conditions are treated differently, the Act in question does not
classify, but arbitrarily discriminates. See Hing v. Crowley, 113 U. S. 702; Railway Co. v. Beckwith, 129 U. S. 26;
American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89;

Statutes purporting to prohibit the formation of trusts
for the purpose of fixing the price or regulating the production of articles of commerce, but exempting from their
provisions all persons engaged in agriculture and raising
live stock, are unconstitutional as class legislation denying the equal protection of the laws to those not included
in the exempted class. 6 R. C. L., § 396; Connolly qv.

Certain it is that the defendants are associated in a new
form of combination and are resorting to methods which
are not normal. If, looking at the entire contract by
which they are bound together, in the light of what has
been done under it, the Court can see that its necessary
tendency is to suppress competition in trade between the

States, the combination must be declared unlawful.
American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257
U. S. 66.
Plaintiff in error, having been injured by the method of
defendant in error in conducting its business, was compelled to ask for relief asserted in the third paragraph of
its answer in the form of a counterclaim; because the admitted facts therein recited conclusively show defendant
in error to be a monopoly, trust and combine operating in
violation of the Federal Anti-Trust Laws. Clabough v.
Southern Wholesale Growers Ass'n, 181 U. S. 706.
If § 27 is invalid, defendant in *error has no right of
action, and the counterclaim of plaintiff in error stands
alone as a direct action. If for any reason it should be
proper to eliminate from the third paragraph so much of
its allegations as invokes damages under the Sherman
Anti-Trust Act, there would remain sufficient allegations
to enable plaintiff in error to amend, and under the facts
stated, invoke damages pursuant to the provisions of the
common law. L. & N. Ry. v. Pointer, 113 Ky. 952.
Any person who has been injured in his trade or business by the activities of an unlawful combination for that
purpose is now generally held to be entitled to recover
,damages in an action at law for the loss suffered, both at
common law and under the Anti-Trust statutes. Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U. S. 513.
The counterclaim of plaintiff in error is not a suit in
equity to prevent and restrain violations of the Sherman
Act; nor does it indirectly attack the existence. of defendant in error corporation, but calls in question the
powers which the corporation has undertaken to exercise
by reason of which plaintiff in error has been injured.

The provision that co-operative associations shall not
be considered in restraint of trade or contrary to the
laws against pooling or combinations, is a proper declaration of public policy.
The Congress of the United States has declared this
policy. Clayton Act; Capper-Volstead Act, February 18,
1922; Co-operative Marketing Act, July 2, 1926.
Anti-Trust laws are an expression of public policy
adopted by the legislature and by Congress, and may be
changed. That public policy has undergone a change
since the enactment of the original Sherman Anti-Trust
Law and the anti-trust laws of the several States, has
been recognized by 'the courts in numerous cases and
has been recognized at common law without regard to
statute. Potter v. Dark Tobacco Growers Co-op. Ass'n,

MR. JUSTICE

MCREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of

the Court.
The Liberty Warehouse Company, a Kentucky corporation, operates a warehouse at Maysville in that State
and there receives and sells loose-leaf tobacco for the accounts of growers. The Burley Tobacco Growers' Cooperative Marketing Association incorporated under The
Bingham Co-operative Marketing Act (Ch. 1, Acts of
Kentucky, 1922) commenced this proceeding against the
Warehouse Company in the Mason County Circuit Court.
It charged the Warehouse Company with willful violation
of the Act by selling pledged tobacco, and asked judgment
for the prescribed penalty ($500) and attorney's fees.
The Bingham Act (32 sections) authorizes the incorporation of non-profit, cooperative associations for the

orderly marketing of agricultural products; provides only
producers may become members and that the corporation
may contract only with them for marketing such products.
It declares that these contracts shall not be illegal; prescribes penalties for interfering therewith, and further
provides that the association shall not be deemed a conspiracy, illegal combination or monopoly. Three pertinent sections follow.
"Sec. 26. Misdemeanor to induce breach of marketing
contract of co-operative association--spreadingfalse reports about the finances or management thereof.
"Any person or persons or any corporation whose officers or employees knowingly induce or attempt to induce
any member or stockholder of an association organized
hereunder to breach his marketing contract with the association, or who maliciously and knowingly spreads false
reports about the finances or management thereof, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and be subject to a fine of not
less than one hundred ($100.00) dollars and not more
than one thousand ($1,000) dollars for each such offense;
and shall be liable to the association aggrieved in a civil
suit in the penal sum of five hundred ($500) dollars for
each such offense."
"Sec. 27. Warehousemen liable for damages for encouraging or permitting delivery of products in violation of
marketing agreements.
"Any person, firm or corporation conducting a warehouse within the State of Kentucky who solicits or persuades or permits any member of any association organized
hereunder to breach his marketing contract with the association by accepting or receiving such member's products for sale or for auction or for display for sale, contrary
to the terms of any marketing agreement of which said
person or any member of the said firm or any active officer
or manager of the said corporation has knowledge or notice, shall be liable to the association aggrieved in a civil

suit in the penal 6um of five hundred ($500) dollars for
each such offense; and such association shall be entitled
to an injunction against such warehouseman to prevent further breaches and a multiplicity of actions thereon. In
addition, said warehouseman shall pay to the association a
reasonable attorney's fee and all costs involved in any
such litigation or proceedings at law.
"This section is enacted in order to prevent a recurrence or outbreak of violence and to give marketing associations an adequate remedy in the courts against those
who encourage violations of co-operative contracts."
"Sec. 28. Associations are not in restraintof trade.
"Any association organized hereunder shall be deemed
not to be a conspiracy nor a combination in restraint of
trade nor an illegal monopoly; nor an attempt to lessen
competition or to fix prices arbitrarily or to create a combination or pool in violation of any law of this State; and
the marketing contracts and agreements between the association and its members and any agreements authorized
in this act shall be considered not to be illegal nor in restraint of trade nor contrary to the provisions of any statute enacted against pooling or combinations."
The petition (filed Dec. 14, 1923) allegesThat the Association was organized to provide means
for orderly marketing of tobacco grown or acquired by
members and no others. Identical contracts (the standard
form is exhibited) with many growers obligate them to
deliver to it all of their tobacco during five years. Tobacco
received under these contracts is sold to manufacturers
and dealers as market conditions permit and the proceeds
less expenses are distributed among the members, according to quality and quantity of their deliveries.
That one Mike Kielman joined the Association and
executed the standard contract. Notwithstanding this he
delivered two thousand pounds of the 1923 crop to the
Warehouse Company and it sold the same, with full

knowledge of the circumstances. B~fore the sale the
Association notified the Warehouse Company of Kielman's membership and of his marketing contract, requested it not to sell his tobacco and called attention to
the prescribed penalties. "Plaintiff says that after service of said notice and with the full knowledge that said
tobacco had been sold to this plaintiff, the defendant
knowingly persuaded and permitted the said Mike Kielman to breach his marketing contract with the plaintiff
association by accepting and receiving the said member's
product for sale and for auction and selling same contrary to the terms of said marketing agreement, contrary
to the provisions of Sec. 27 of the Bingham Cooperative
Marketing Act."
The standard contract provides-"The Association agrees to buy and the grower agrees
to sell and deliver to the Association all of the tobacco
produced by or for him or acquired by him as landlord or
lessor, during the years 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926.
. The Association agrees to resell such tobacco, together with tobacco of like type, grade and quality delivered by other growers under similar contracts, at the best
prices obtainable by it under market conditions, and to
pay over the net amount received therefrom (less freight,
insurance and interest), as payment in full to the grower
and growers named in contracts similar hereto, according
to the tobacco delivered by each of them," etc.
"Inasmuch as the remedy at law would be inadequate;
and inasmuch as it is now and ever will be impracticable
and extremely difficult to determine the actual damage
resulting to the Association should the grower fail so to
sell and deliver all of his tobacco the grower hereby agrees
to pay to the Association for all tobacco delivered, consigned or marketed or withheld by or for him, other than
in accordance with the terms hereof, the sum of five cents
per pound as liquidated damages, averaged for all types

and grades of tobacco, for the breach of this contract; all
parties agreeing that this contract is one of a series dependent for its true value upon the adherence of each
and all of the growers to each and all of the said contracts.
"The grower agrees that in the event of a breach or
threatened breach by him of any provision, regarding delivery of tobacco the Association shall be entitled to an
injunction to prevent breach or further breach thereof and
to a decree for specific performance and sale of personal
property under special circumstances and conditions, and
that the buyer cannot go to the open markets and buy
tobacco and replace any which the grower may fail to
deliver."
The Warehouse Company presented an amended answer
and counterclaim in three sections.
The first sets up "in estoppel and in bar" of the alleged
action that the Association since January 13, 1922, has
been a trust or combination of the capital, skill and acts
of divers persons and corporations doing commercial business in Kentucky and between that State and other States
and foreign countries "organized and conducted for the
express purpose of unlawfully and contrary to the common law, creating and carrying out restrictions in trade"
under the guise of stabilizing prices.
The second asserts that Sections 26 and 27, Bingham
Act, conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment, abridge
defendant's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the
United States, deprive it of corporate life, liberty and
property without due process of law and deny it equal
protection of the laws.
The third seems to be based upon the Kentucky Declaratory Judgment Law. It advances a counterclaim;
also asks the court to determine whether the Bingham Act
is valid and for a declaration of rights and duties.
The trial court struck section three "from the records"
and sustained demurrers to sections one and two. The

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

Warehouse Company elected to plead no further. Trial
by jury was waived "the petition being submitted to the
court on the law and facts." Judgment for $500--the
prescribed penalty-and $100 attorney's fees went for
the Association, and was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
In order to prevail here the Warehouse Company must
show that enforcement of the challenged judgment would
deprive it-not another-of some right arising under the
Constitution or laws of the United States properly asserted
below. Southern Railway Co. v. King, 217 U. S. 524;
Standard Stock Food Co. v. Wright, 225 U. S. 540; Hendrick v. Maryland, 235 U. S. 610, 621; Jeffrey Mfg. Co. v.
Blagg, 235 U. S. 571, 576; Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U. S. 282, 289.
No Federal right was impaired by striking section three
from the amended answer and counterclaim. Proceedings in state courts must conform to the reasonable requirements of local law. Whether they do is primarily
for those courts to determine. Here we find no abuse of
that power.
Section three asserts--" Defendant now makes its application to this court, upon its counterclaim, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 83 of the acts of 1922
of the General Assembly of Kentucky known as the Declaratory Judgment Law for the purpose of securing a
declaration of its rights and duties under said Bingham
Cooperative Marketing Act, in relation to the common
law and the State and Federal Constitutions, as well as
the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, and for the purpose of
having this court determine whether in the conduct of its
business it will be necessary for it to comply with the
provisions of said Bingham Cooperative Marketing Act,
or whether it is invalid in whole or part, and if so, in
what part."
Apparently the Declaratory Judgment statute authorizes plaintiffs only to ask for judgments. It also piovides:

WAREHOUSE CO. v. TOBACCO GROWERS.
71

89

Opinion of the Court.

"The court may refuse to exercise the power to declare
rights, duties or other legal relations in any case where
a decision under it would not terminate the uncertainty or
controversy which gave rise to the action, or in any case
where the declaration or counterclaim is not necessary or
proper at the time under all the circumstances." This
Court has no jurisdiction to review a mere declaratory
judgment. Liberty Warehouse Company v. Grannis, 273
U. S. 70.
Section one presents no Federal question. It does not
mention the Constitution or any statute of the United
States, but claims that the Association is an unlawful
trust or combination under common law rules. But the
present controversy concerns a statute and a State may
freely alter, amend or abolish the common law within its
jurisdiction. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. v. Baugh, 149 U. S.
368, 378.
Section two challenges sections 26 and 27 of the Bingham Act because they offend the Fourteenth Amendment
"in that said sections and each of them abridges defendant's privileges and immunities as a citizen of the United
States and deprives defendant of its corporate life, liberty
and property without due process of law and denies to-it
the equal protection of the laws." This suggests the only
Federal questions open for our consideration. The pleadings allege no burden upon interstate commerce amounting to regulation, nor do they properly and definitely
advance any claim under a Federal statute.
A corporation does not possess the privileges and immunities of a citizen of the United States within the
meaning of the Constitution. Western Turf Assn. v.
Greenberg,204 U. S. 359, 363; Selover v. Walsh, 226 U. S.
112. The allegation concerning deprivation of corporate
life is unimportant.
Certainly the statute impaired no right of the Warehouse Company guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amend-

OCTOBER TERM, 1927.
Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

ment by merely authorizing corporations with membership limited to agriculturists and permitting contracts for
purchase and resale of farm products. This also is true
of the declaration that such associations shall not be
deemed monopolies, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, and that contracts with members shall
not be illegal. The state may declare its own policy
as to such matters.
Sections 26 and 27 prohibit interference with contracts
permitted by local law and not alleged to conflict with
Federal law. Twenty-six declares any person or corporation who knowingly induces a member to break his marketing contract guilty of a misdemeanor and subjects him
to a fine; also to suit for the penal sum of $500. Twentyseven hits warehousemen who solicit, persuade or permit
a member to break his marketing contract by accepting or
receiving pledged products for sale and subjects them to
penalties. It was under the latter section that judgment
went against the Warehouse Company.
The court below affirmed "there is no statute at present in this State, nor was there any when the cause of
action herein arose, against pools, trusts and monopolies."
Considering this and further declarations in the same
opinion, we cannot say that any common law rule recognized in the State of Kentucky forbade associations or
contracts similar to those before us when intended to promote orderly marketing. Undoubtedly the State had
power to authorize formation of corporations by farmers
for the purpose of dealing in their own products. And
there is nothing to show that since the Bingham Act producers may not form voluntary associations and through
them make and enforce contracts like those expressly
authorized.
Do the provisions of the Bingham Act which afford peculiar protection to marketing contracts with members
of the Association deprive the Warehouse Company of

WAREHOUSE CO. v. TOBACCO GROWERS.
71

91

Opinion of the Court.

equal protection of the laws, or conflict with the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because
without reasonable basis and purely arbitrary? These
questions may be fairly said to arise upon the present
record.
The statute penalizes all who wittingly solicit, persuade,
or induce an association member to break his marketing
contract. It does not prescribe more rigorous penalties
for warehousemen than for other offenders. Nobody is
permitted to do what is denied to warehousemen. There
is no substantial basis upon which to invoke the equal
protection clause.
Connolly v. Union Sewer Piper Co., 184 U. S. 540, is
much relied upon. But there the circumstances differed
radically from those here presented; and always to determine whether equal protection is denied there must be
consideration of the peculiar facts. Connolly resisted
judgment for the purchase price of pipe upon the ground
that the Union Company, the vendor, belonged to a combination or trust forbidden by an Illinois statute. The
statute defined a trust, made participation therein criminal, and directed that those who purchased articles from
an offending member should not be held liable for the
price. Section 9 declared-" The provisions of this act
shall not apply to agricultural products or live stock while
in the hands of the producer or raiser." This court held
that because of the exemption the Union Company was
denied the eqial protection of the law. It was forbidden
to do what others could do with impunity. Here the situation is very different. The questioned statute undertakes to protect sanctioned contracts against any interference-no one could lawfully do what the Warehouse
Company did.
Counsel maintain that the Bingham Act takes from the
Warehouse Company the right to carry on business in the
usual way by accepting and selling the tobacco of those

276 U.S.

who voluntarily seek its services and thus unduly abridges
its liberty. Undoubtedly the statute does prohibit and
penalize action not theretofore so restricted and to that extent interferes with freedom. But this is done to protect
certain contracts which the legislature deemed of great
importance to the public and peculiarly subject to invasion. We need not determine whether the liberty protected by the Constitution includes the right to induce a
breach of contract between others for the aggrandizement
of the intermeddler-to violate the nice sense of right
which honorable traders ought to observe.
In Minnesota, etc., Marketing Association v. Radke
(1925) 163 Minn. 403, provisions of the cooperative marketing act of Minnesota substantially like Section 27 were
declared invalid. The Supreme Court said: "It seems
clear to us that it is beyond the power of the legislature
to make it a tort to purchase, in the ordinary course of a
legitimate business, from the true owner a wholesome
staple commodity upon which there is no lien and which
is not under any ban or regulation because of inherent
qualities or use. Liberty of contract is assured by both
state and Federal Constitutions."
On the other hand, in Commonwealth v. Hodges (1910)
137 Ky. 233, the Kentucky Court of Appeals sustained a
statute which made it a criminal offense knowingly to purchase a crop pledged to an unincorporated marketing
association. The same doctrine is accepted by the opinion
below.
It is stated without contradiction that co-operative
marketing statutes substantially like the one under review
have been enacted by forty-two States. Congress has
recognized the utility of co-operative association among
farmers in the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730; the CapperVolstead Act, 42 Stat. 388; and the Co-operative Marketing Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 802. These statutes reveal widespread legislative approval of the plan for protecting

scattered producers and advancing the public interest.
Although frequently challenged, we do not find that any
court has condemned an essential feature of the plan with
the single exception of the Supreme Court of Minnesota
in the above cited case.
In the court below it was said"We take judicial knowledge of the history of the
country and of current events and from that source we
know that conditions at the time of the enactment of
the Bingham Act were such that the agricultural producer
was at the mercy of speculators and others who fixed the
price of the selling producer and the final consumer
through combinations and other arrangements, whether
valid or invalid, and that by reason thereof the former
obtained a grossly inadequate price for his products. So
much so was that the case that the intermediate handlers
between the producer and the final consumer injuriously
operated upon both classes and fattened and flourished at
their expense. It was and is also a well known fact that
without the agricultural producer society could not exist
and the oppression brought about in the manner indicated was driving him from his farm thereby creating a
condition fully justifying an exception in his case from
any provision of the common law, and likewise justifying
legislative action in the exercise of its police power."
The Supreme Court of Alabama declared in Warren v.
Alabama Farm Bureau Cotton Association (1925) 213
Ala. 61"So far as we are advised, no American court has condemned a co-operative marketing contract of the character of this complainant association as injurious to the
public interest or in any way violative of public policy.
On the contrary, such contracts have been everywhere
upheld as valid, if not positively beneficial to the public
interest."

Opinion of the Court.

276 U. S.

In Arkansas Cotton Growers Co-op. Assn. v. Brown
(1925) 168 Ark. 504, the court sustained a Co-operative
Marketing Act"The statute seems to be in a form which has become
standard, and has been enacted in many of the states, the
enactment of such legislation being manifestly prompted
by the universal urge to promote prosperity in agricultural pursuits. There has been much discussion of the
plan in the decisions of the courts of the various states
where it has been adopted, and the general view expressed
is that the statute should be liberally construed in order
to carry out the design in its broadest scope."
In Manchester Dairy System, Inc. v. Hayward (1926)
82 N. H. 193, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire
said"Co-operative marketing agreements, containing the
essential features of the contract here considered, have
been recognized in many of our states as a legitimate
means of protecting its members against oppression, of
avoiding the waste incident to the dumping of produce
upon the market with the consequent wide fluctuations in
prices and of securing to the producer a larger share of
the price paid by the consumer for his products. Associations of the character here exist in practically all of our
states and deal in nearly every form of agricultural
product. From year to year the co-operative idea in
marketing has been assuming wider scope and greater
economic importance. Public approval of such co-operative organizations is evidenced by the adoption of enabling legislation in more than two-thirds of the states,
including our own. . . . Such legislation has received
liberal construction by the courts. Minn. Wheat Growers'
Assn. v. Huggins,' 203 N. W. 420, et seq. . . . No
sufficient ground appears from the record for holding that
the contract here under consideration is contrary to public
policy."

Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Assn. v. Jones, 185 N. C. 265-"In view of the necessity of protecting those engaged
in raising tobacco against the combination of those who
buy the raw product at their own figures and sell it to the
public at prices also fixed by themselves, this movement
has been organized. By a careful examination of all the
provisions of the act under which the association is acting,
it will be seen that every precaution has been taken to
insure that it will not be used for private gain and can
operate only for the protection of the producers."
Northern Wisconsin Co-operative Tobacco Pool v. Bekkedal, 182 Wis. 571"The reasons for promoting such legislation are generally understood. It sprang from a general, if not wellnigh universal, belief that the present system of marketing is expensive and wasteful and results in an unconscionable spread between what is paid the producer and
that charged the consumer. It was for the purpose of
encouraging efforts to bring about more direct marketing
methods, thus benefiting both producer and consumer and
thereby promoting the general interest and the public
welfare, that the legislation was enacted."
The purpose of the penalty clause (Section 27) was
pointed out by the Supreme Court of Tennessee. Dark
Tobacco Growers' Co-op. Assn. v. Dunn (1924), 150 Tenn.
614"The complainant could not do business without tobacco. When it contracts to sell, it must fill its contracts
with tobacco delivered by its members. It cannot replace defendant's tobacco by purchasing upon the open
market. Its charter prohibits it from so doing. For each
pound of tobacco which is not delivered to the association
by a member, there is a pro rataincrease in the operating
costs of the association; and that increase cannot be estimated in terms of money with definite exactness. For
every defection of one member, there is a certain amount

of dissatisfaction engendered among other members; indeed, other members are encouraged not to deliver their
tobacco, and the normal increase of the association's members is prevented. All of these things result in damage,
but the amount of damage cannot possibly be computed."
Other pertinent cases are assembled in margin.'
The opinion generally accepted-and upon reasonable
grounds, we think-is that the co-operative marketing
statutes promote the common interest. The provisions
for protecting the fundamental contracts against interference by outsiders are essential to the plan. This Court
has recognized as permissibre some discrimination intended
to encourage agriculture. American Sugar Refining Co.

U. S. 199; Jones v. Union Guano Co., 264 U. S. 171.
Viewing all the circumstances, it is impossible for us to say
that the legislature of Kentucky could not treat marketing
contracts between the Association and its members as
of a separate class, provide against probable interference
therewith, and to that extent limit the sometime action of
warehousemen.
The liberty of contract guaranteed by the Constitution
is freedom from arbitrary restraint-not immunity from
reasonable regulation to safeguard the public interest.
The question is whether the restrictions of the statute
have reasonable relation to a proper purpose. Miller v.
