is appointed. Texas v. New Mexico, p. 388.
See also Estate Taxes; Justiciability;
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
Standing to Sue; Supreme Court, 4.
I. Due Process.
1. Contempt of court order to pay child support.-Where respondent
was adjudged in contempt of state-court child support order and was put on
probation and ordered to pay an arrearage, question whether legislative
presumption that shifted to respondent burden of proving financial inability to pay violated Due Process Clause is remanded, since disposition of
case turns on whether relief afforded is criminal or-if payment of arrearage would purge respondent's contempt judgment-civil in nature. Hicks
v. Feiock, p. 624.
2. Probate code-Nonclaim statute-Actual notice required.-Oklahoma's nonclaim statute-which provides that creditors' claims against an
estate are generally barred unless they are presented to executor or executrix within two months of publication of notice of commencement of probate proceedings-is not a self-executing statute of limitations but operates in conjunction with state probate proceedings to "adversely affect"
appellant creditor's property interest; thus, Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment requires that appellant be given actual notice by mail
or other such means if appellant's identity was known or was "reasonably
ascertainable" by appellee executrix. Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope-, p. 478.
3. Rent control ordinance-Fixingreasonable rent. -Provision in city's
rent control ordinance allowing a hearing officer to consider a tenant's
hardship in fixing a reasonable rent does not render ordinance facially
invalid under Due Process Clause because ordinance's scheme represents a
rational attempt to accommodate conflicting interests of protecting tenants
from burdensome rent increases while insuring that landlords are guaranteed a fair return on their investment. Pennell v. San Jose, p. 1.
4. Review of default judgment-State-law meritorious defense requirement.-Due Process Clause is violated by a Texas law requirement
that an individual bringing a bill of review proceeding to challenge a default

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
judgment for invalid personal service or notice must show a meritorious
defense to action in which judgment was entered. Peralta v. Heights
Medical Center, Inc., p. 80.
II. Equal Protection of the Laws.
1. Foreign embassies-Labor picketing.-District of Columbia Code
§22-1116-which excludes labor picketing from general prohibitions
against congregating or displaying signs that would bring foreign government into public odium or disrepute within 500 feet of foreign embassies does not require unequal treatment of nonlabor and labor picketing in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, since § 22-1116's primary function
of ensuring that display clause did not prohibit labor picketing has been
pre-empted by this Court's conclusion that that clause violates First
Amendment; and since, under Court of Appeals' construction that congregation clause applies only to congregations that threaten an embassy's
peace or security, any peaceful congregation, including a peaceful labor
congregation, is permitted. Boos v. Barry, p. 312.
2. Rent control ordinance-Rational relationship to legitimate state
purpose. -City's rent control ordinance allowing a hearing officer to consider a tenant's hardship in fixing reasonable rent, on its face, does not
violate Equal Protection Clause where its scheme is rationally related to
legitimate purpose of protecting tenants, and it is not irrational to treat
landlords differently on basis of whether or not they have hardship tenants. Pennell v. San Jose, p. 1.
3. Striking workers -Eligibility for food stamps. - Section 109 of Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981-which provides that no household
may become eligible to participate in food stamp program while any of its
members is on strike or may receive an increase in food stamp allotment
because of decrease in striking member's income-does not violate equal
protection component of Fifth Amendment, since it is rationally related to
legitimate governmental objective of avoiding undue favoritism in private
labor disputes. Lyng v. Automobile Workers, p. 360.
III. Freedom of Assembly.
Foreign embassies-Congregating and refnsing to disperse.-Congregation clause of District of Columbia Code § 22-1115-which prohibits three
or more persons from congregating within 500 feet of an embassy and refusing to obey a police dispersal order-is not facially violative of First
Amendment under Court of Appeals' narrowing construction that clause
permits dispersal only of congregations that are directed at an embassy
and only when police reasonably believe that embassy's "security or peace"
is threatened. Boos v. Barry, p. 312.

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
IV. Freedom of Association and Expression.
Striking workers-Eligibility for food stamps. - Section 109 of Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981-which provides that no household may
become eligible to participate in food stamp program while any of its members is on strike or may receive an increase in food stamp allotment because of decrease in striking member's income-(1) does not violate First
Amendment right of appellees, striking workers, to associate with their
families or associational rights of appellees and their unions, and (2) does
not abridge appellees' right to express themselves about union matters
free of coercion by Government. Lyng v. Autombile Workers, p. 360.
V. Freedom of Religion.
1. Indians' rights-Effect of road building and timber harvesting on religious sites. -Free Exercise Clause does not prohibit Forest Service from
constructing a road or permitting timber harvesting in part of Six Rivers
National Forest used by Indians for spiritual activities, especially where
Government has taken steps to minimize impact of construction on Indian
religious activities in accordance with American Indian Religious Freedom
Act. Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., p. 439.
2. Unemployment compensation benefits -Religious use of peyote.Where respondent drug and alcohol rehabilitation counselors were discharged for having ingested peyote, a hallucinogenic, during a religious
ceremony of Native American Church, Oregon Supreme Court must make
definitive ruling whether religious use of peyote is legal when, under state
law, peyote possession is a felony, before federal constitutional issuewhether denial of unemployment compensation unduly burdened respondents' religious freedom under First Amendment-can be decided. Employment Division, Oregon Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, p. 660.
VI. Freedom of Speech.
Foreignembassies-Displaying signs. -Display clause of District of Columbia Code § 22-1115-which makes it unlawful to display any sign within
500 feet of an embassy that tends to bring foreign government into "public
odium" or "public disrepute"-is facially violative of First Amendment,
since it is a content-based restriction on political speech in a public forum
which is not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. Boos
v. Barry, p. 312.
VII. Freedom of the Press.
Intentional infliction of emotional distress-"Actual malice" standard.-In order to protect free flow of ideas and opinions on matters of public interest and concern, First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit public
figures and public officials from recovering damages for tort of intentional
infliction of emotional distress by reason of publication of a caricature such

INDEX

as ad parody at issue without showing that publication contains a false
statement of fact which was made with "actual malice." Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, p. 46.
VIII. Intergovernmental Tax Immunity.
Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982-Federalincome tax
on state bond interest.-Section 310(b)(1) of TEFRA-which permits Federal Government to tax as income interest earned on unregistered state
and local government bonds -does not violate doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity. South Carolina v. Baker, p. 505.
IX. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.
Prosecutor's comments about defendant's failure to testify.-Where
prosecutor's closing-argument statement that defendant could have testified but did not is a fair response to defense counsel's closing-argument
remarks that government had not allowed defendant to explain his side
of story, there is no violation of Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. United States v. Robinson, p. 25.
X. States' Powers.
Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982-Federal income
tax exemption for bonds.-Section 310(b)(1) of TEFRA-which removes
federal income tax exemption for interest earned on publicly offered longterm bonds issued by state and local governments unless those bonds are
issued in registered rather than bearer form-does not violate Tenth
Amendment or constitutional principles of federalism by effectively compelling States to issue bonds in registered form. South Carolina v. Baker,
p. 505.
XI. Supremacy Clause.
Attachment of prisoner's Social Security benefits. -Arkansas statute
authorizing State to seize a prisoner's Social Security benefits to help defray costs of maintaining its prison system violates Supremacy Clause because it permits State to attach funds that are exempt from legal process
under 42 U. S. C. § 407(a). Bennett v. Arkansas, p. 395.

whose citizenship orders and certificates of naturalization "were illegally

misrepresentation," test of whether concealments or misrepresentations
are "material" is whether they can be shown by clear, unequivocal, and
convincing evidence to have been predictably capable of affecting Immigration and Naturalization Service's decisions, and § 1101(f)(6)-which provides that a person be deemed not to be of good moral character if he "has
given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining" immigration or naturalization benefits-does not impose a materiality requirement for false testimony for purposes of "illegally procured" provision. Kungys v. United

1. Agency-Relationship between corporation and partnership.Where, in order to avoid Kentucky's usury law limit on annual interest rate
for noncorporate borrowers, partnerships formed to develop apartment
complexes each entered into an agreement with respondent's corporation
providing (1) that corporation would hold title to property as partnership's
nominee and agent solely to secure financing, (2) that partnership would
have sole control of and responsibility for complex, and (3) that partnership
was principal landowner of property during financing, construction, and
operation, partnerships were owners of complexes for federal income tax
purposes, since in each instance their relationship with corporation was, in
both form and substance, an agency with partnership as principal. Commissioner v. Bollinger, p. 340.
2. Capital assets - Taxpayer's motivation for purchasing.-A taxpayer's motivation in purchasing an assest is irrelevant to question whether

1. Abuse-of-discretion standard-Board of Immigration Appeals.Abuse-of-discretion standard of judicial review is appropriate where Board

p. 94.

JUDICIAL REVIEW.

2. Administrative action by Veterans' Administration (VA)-Conflict
with RehabilitationAct. -38 U. S. C. § 211(a)-which bars judicial review
of VA Administrator's decisions on any questions of law or fact under any
VA-administered law providing benefits for veterans -does not foreclose
from judicial review question whether VA's alcoholism regulation-which
classifies alcoholism as "willful misconduct"-violates Rehabilitation Act.
Traynor v. Turnage, p. 535.
JURISDICTION.
1. Challenge of trademark regulations.-In a suit claiming that trademark regulation regulating imports of "gray-market" goods is inconsistent
with § 526 of Tariff Act of 1930, District Court had jurisdiction under 28
U. S. C. § 1331, and Court of International Trade did not have exclusive
jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1581(i)(3) or § 1581(i)(4). K mart Corp. v.
Cartier, Inc., p. 176.
2. Dismissal of writ of certiorari-Specialprosecutor's authority.Where Solicitor General has denied a special prosecutor authority to represent United States before Supreme Court in a case seeking reinstatement
of a criminal contempt judgment, prosecutor lacked such authority and
writ of certiorari is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. United States v.

ordinance's tenant hardship provision violates Takings Clause-by reducing, because of hardship, rent that would otherwise be reasonable, thus
transferring landlord's property to hardship tenants-is premature, since
there is no evidence that hardship provision has ever been used to reduce
rent below reasonable level and since provision does not require that hearing officer reduce rent on grounds of tenant hardship. Pennell v. San

PRE-EMPTION OF PUERTO RICO LAW BY FEDERAL LAW.
Petroleum regulations-Energy Policy and ConservationAct. -Puerto
Rico Department of Consumer Affairs' regulations governing petroleum
allocation and pricing are not pre-empted by Congress' decision to decontrol oil prices in Energy Policy and Conservation Act, since fact that Federal Government terminates or reduces its regulation of a field of commerce does not announce a new rule of burden shifting replacing normal
need to find a federal intent to pre-empt with a need to find a federal intent
to retransfer authority to States; test for pre-emption of Puerto Rico law is
same as test for pre-emption of a State's law. Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. Isla Petroleum Corp., p. 495.

PRE-EMPTION OF STATE LAW BY FEDERAL LAW.
Public utilities-Natural Gas Act of 1938.-Michigan Public Service
Commission regulation of respondent natural gas companies, under Michigan's Public Utilities Securities Act, impinges on a field that Congress,
through Natural Gas Act of 1938, intended Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to regulate exclusively; and Michigan Act, therefore, is preempted. Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., p. 293.

SECURITIES REGULATION.
Shareholders' suit-Rule lOb-5-Materiality test.-In a suit by share-

holders alleging that they had sold stock at prices artificially depressed
by company's false or misleading statements denying ongoing merger negotiations, TSCY Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc. standard-whereby

an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that its disclosure would have been considered significant by a reasonable investoris adopted for the § 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 context; both "agreement-inprinciple" test and view that information concerning otherwise insignficant
developments becomes material solely because of affirmative denial of their
existence are rejected; materiality in a merger context depends on facts
and is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; it is appropriate to apply
a rebuttable presumption of reliance, supported in part by fraud-on-themarket theory. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, p. 224.

basis of pleadings, all material allegations in complaint must be taken as
true and construed in favor of complaining party, appellants-a landlord
and an association of owners and lessors of real property who alleged that
they were subject to a city's rent control ordinance-had standing to challenge ordinance even though they did not allege that either landlord or association members had "hardship tenants" who might trigger ordinance's
hearing process or that they had been or would be aggrieved by a hearing
officer's decision that a proposed rent increase is unreasonable on ground of
tenant hardship. Pennell v. San Jose, p. 1.

without addressing constitutional claim on its merits because, although
courts below did not articulate necessity for their constitutional holdings in

when necessary, it appears reasonably likely that First Amendment issue
