PATTERSON v. McLEAN CREDIT UNION
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF
APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
No. 87-107. Order entered April 25, 1988
Held: In light of the difficulties posed by petitioner's argument for a fundamental extension of liability under 42 U. S. C. § 1981, this case is
restored to the calendar for reargument and the parties are requested
to brief and argue the question whether the interpretation of § 1981
adopted by this Court in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, should be
reconsidered.
Restored to calendar for reargument.
PER CURIAM.

This case is restored to the calendar for reargument. The
parties are requested to brief and argue the following
question:
"Whether or not the interpretation of 42 U. S. C. § 1981
adopted by this Court in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S.
160 (1976), should be reconsidered?"
One might think from the dissents of our colleagues from
the above order that our decision to hear argument as to
whether the decision in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160
(1976), should be reconsidered is a "first" in the history of the
Court. One would also think from the language of the dissents that we have decided today to overrule Runyon v.
McCrary. We have of course done no such thing, but have
decided, in light of the difficulties posed by petitioner's argument for a fundamental extension of liability under 42
U. S. C. § 1981, to consider whether Runyon should be overruled. It is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether a particular precedent should be
modified or overruled.
Three Terms ago, for example, we requested the parties to
reargue the validity of our decision in National League of
Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976). Garciav. San Anto-

nio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 468 U. S. 1213 (1984)
(ordering reargument), 469 U. S. 528 (1985) (decision). Two
Terms before that we requested the parties to reargue and
brief the question whether the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule should apply where the evidence was obtained
reasonably and in good faith. Illinois v. Gates, 459 U. S.
1028 (1982) (ordering reargument), 462 U. S.213 (1983) (decision). In 1975, we ordered the parties in Alfred Dunhill of
London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 422 U. S. 1005 (1975) (ordering reargument), 425 U. S. 682 (1976) (decision), to address whether we should reconsider our holding in Banco
Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U. S. 398, 439 (1964),
which had reaffirmed the Court's adherence to the "act of
state" doctrine. And in Benton v. Maryland, 393 U. S. 994
(1968) (ordering reargument), 395 U. S. 784 (1969) (decision),
the Court requested reargument on the question whether the
''concurrent sentence doctrine" had continuing validity.
In addition, we have explicitly overruled statutory precedents in a host of cases. See, e. g., Monell v. New York City
Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S.658 (1978), overruling Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961); Continental T. V., Inc. v.
GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36 (1977), overruling United
States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967); Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 427
U. S. 132 (1976), overruling Auto Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., 336 U. S.245 (1949); Braden v. 30th
Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U. S. 484 (1973),
overruling Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948); Andrews v.
Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S.320 (1972), overruling Moore v. Illinois Central R. Co., 312 U. S. 630 (1941);
Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235 (1970),
overruling Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U. S. 195
(1962); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), overruling
McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934). These actions do not
mean that the Court has been insensitive to considerations of
stare decisis, but only that we recognize it as "'a principle of

policy and not a mechanical formula,"' Boys Markets, supra,
at 241 (quoting Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119
(1940) (Frankfurter, J.)).
Both of the dissents intimate that the statutory question
involved in Runyon v. McCrary should not be subject to the
same principles of stare decisis as other decisions because it
benefited civil rights plaintiffs by expanding liability under
the statute. We do not believe that the Court may recognize
any such exception to the abiding rule that it treat all litigants equally: that is, that the claim of any litigant for the
application of a rule to its case should not be influenced by the
Court's view of the worthiness of the litigant in terms of
extralegal criteria. We think this is what Congress meant
when it required each Justice or judge of the United States to
swear to "administer justice without respect to persons, and
do equal right to the poor and to the rich .... " 28 U. S. C.
§ 453.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.

The Court today asks the parties to rebrief and reargue
this case, focusing not on some neglected subtlety of the issues presented for review or on any overlooked jurisdictional
detail, but on a question not presented: Whether the Court
should reconsider its 7-2 opinion (WHITE and REHNQUIST,
JJ., dissenting) in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976).
The Court's determination now to reach out to reconsider
that prior decision and everything that has been built upon it,
is neither restrained, nor judicious, nor consistent with the
accepted doctrine of stare decisis. See, e. g., Vasquez v.
Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 266 (1986) ("[T]he careful observer
will discern that any detours from the straight path of stare
decisis in our past have occurred for articulable reasons, and
only when the Court has felt obliged 'to bring its opinions into
agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained,"' quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285
U. S.393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).

Twelve years ago, consistently with our prior decisions in
Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409 (1968); Tillman
v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., 410 U. S. 431
(1973); and Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421
U. S. 454 (1975), we observed that it is "well established"
that 42 U. S. C. § 1981 "prohibits racial discrimination in the
making and enforcement of private contracts." Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U. S., at 168. We reaffirmed our reading of
the legislative history and language of the statute as reaching
private acts of racial discrimination, and emphasized that in
the years since Jones, Congress specifically had considered
and rejected legislation to override our interpretation of the
Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, on which § 1981 is based.
427 U. S., at 174, and n. 11. Writing for the Court, Justice
Stewart noted:
"There could hardly be a clearer indication of congressional agreement with the view that § 1981 does reach
private acts of racial discrimination. . . . In these
circumstances there is no basis for deviating from the
well-settled principles of stare decisis applicable to this
Court's construction of federal statutes." Id., at 174175 (emphasis in original).
See also id., at 186-187 (Powell, J., concurring); id., at
189-192 (STEVENS, J., concurring); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977) ("[W]e must bear in mind that
considerations of stare decisis weigh heavily in the area of
statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this
Court's interpretation of its legislation" (WHITE, J., writing
for the Court)).
We continually have endorsed, in the employment and
other contexts, Runyon's interpretation that § 1981 reaches
private conduct. See, e. g., Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co.,
482 U. S. 656 (1987); Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji,
481 U. S. 604 (1987); General Building Contractors Assn.,
Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375 (1982). See also Mem-

phis v. Greene, 451 U. S. 100 (1981). Over 100 lower court
opinions cite the relevant portions of Runyon and its progeny. The parties in this case have not informed us of anything that suggests Congress has reconsidered its position on
this statutory matter in light of Runyon and subsequent
cases. I see no reason whatsoever for the Court deliberately
to reach out in the manner it does today.
Although it is probably true that most racial discrimination
in the employment context will continue to be redressable
under other statutes, it may be that racial discrimination in
certain other contexts is not actionable independently of
§ 1981. I am at a loss to understand the motivation of five
Members of this Court to reconsider an interpretation of a
civil rights statute that so clearly reflects our society's earnest commitment to ending racial discrimination, and in
which Congress so evidently has acquiesced. I can find no
justification for the bare majority's apparent eagerness to
consider rewriting well-established law.
I dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join, dissenting.

While I join JUSTICE BLACKMUN'S dissenting opinion, I
write separately to emphasize those aspects of the Court's
action today that I believe render the order particularly ill
advised.
The Court's spontaneous decision to reexamine our holding
in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160 (1976), is certain to
engender widespread concern in those segments of our population that must rely on a federal rule of law as a protection against invidious private discrimination. Although the
present case involves a claim of discrimination in the workplace, an area of the law where there is substantial overlap
between 42 U. S. C. § 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq., a reexamination of the issue of statutory construction decided in
Runyon implicates a much broader sphere of conduct. Run-

yon itself did not involve a claim of employment discrimination, but the question "whether ...

42 U. S. C. § 1981, pro-

hibits private schools from excluding qualified children solely
because they are Negroes." 427 U. S., at 163. The Court's
order today will, by itself, have a deleterious effect on the
faith reposed by racial minorities in the continuing stability of
a rule of law that guarantees them the "same right" as "white
citizens."* To recognize an equality right-a right that 12
years ago we thought "well established"-and then to declare
unceremoniously that perhaps we were wrong and had better
reconsider our prior judgment, is to replace what is ideally a
sense of guaranteed right with the uneasiness of unsecured
privilege. Time alone will tell whether the erosion in faith is
unnecessarily precipitous, but in the meantime, some of the
harm that will flow from today's order may never be completely undone.
In addition to the impact of today's decision on the faith of
victims of racial discrimination in a stable construction of the
civil rights laws, the order must also have a detrimental and
enduring impact on the public's perception of the Court as an
impartial adjudicator of cases and controversies brought to
us for decision by lawyers representing adverse interests in
contested litigation. The parties have asked us to decide
whether § 1981 encompasses "a claim for racial discrimination
in the terms and conditions of employment, including a claim
that petitioner was harassed because of her race." Pet. for
Cert. i. Neither the parties nor the Solicitor General have
argued that Runyon should be reconsidered.
*Section 1981 provides:
"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to
sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws
and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by
white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties,
taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other."

As I have said before, "the adversary process functions
most effectively when we rely on the initiative of lawyers,
rather than the activism of judges, to fashion the questions
for review." New Jersey v. T. L. 0., 468 U. S. 1214, 1216
(1984) (dissenting from order directing reargument). If the
Court decides to cast itself adrift from the constraints imposed by the adversary process and to fashion its own
agenda, the consequences for the Nation-and for the future
of this Court as an institution-will be even more serious
than any temporary encouragement of previously rejected
forms of racial discrimination. The Court has inflicted a
serious-and unwise-wound upon itself today.
