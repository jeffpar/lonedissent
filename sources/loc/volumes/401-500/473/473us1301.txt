AMERICAN FEDERATION OF GOVERNMENT
EMPLOYEES, AFL-CIO
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE ORDER
No. A-5.

Decided July 5, 1985

An application to vacate the Court of Appeals' June 29, 1985, orderwhich, inter alia, directed that the July 1, 1985, effective date of certain
new regulations of applicant Office of Personnel Management be stayed
until further order of that court-is granted. A fews days before the
effective date of the regulations, which allow federal agencies to give
more weight to merit and less weight to seniority in personnel decisions,
respondent sought a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of the regulations from the District Court, which denied the requested order but explicitly contemplated a prompt hearing on a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in addition to staying
the effective date of the regulations, ordered that respondent's emergency motion for injunctive relief from that court be held in abeyance
and that the District Court decide by July 10, 1985, "any motion for
a preliminary injunction." The established rule is that denials of temporary restraining orders are ordinarily not appealable, and the C3urt
of Appeals erred in reasoning that because a hearing on a preliminary
injunction could not be held before the regulations went into effect, the
District Court's denial of the temporary restraining order was tantamount to a denial of a preliminary injunction. The authorities relied
upon by the Court of Appeals relate to grants rather than, as here, denials of temporary restraining orders. Thus the Court of Appeals had no
jurisdiction to review the District Court's denial of the temporary restraining order, and should have dismissed the appeal, thereby allowing
respondent to proceed in the District Court on a motion for a preliminary
injunction.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,

Circuit Justice.

affecting federal employees.'

473 U. S.

The new regulations were

intended to allow federal agencies to give more weight to
merit and less weight to seniority in personnel decisions.
The new regulations were to take effect November 25, 1983.
On November 12, 1983, Congress adopted House Joint
Resolution 413 which, in effect, prohibited OPM and several
cther federal agencies from expending funds appropriated

under that resolution "to implement, promulgate, administer
or enforce" the new regulations. 2 On November 21, 1983,
OPM announced that the new regulations would become effective on November 25, 1983.1 The announcement stated

that no expenditure was required for the new regulations to
go into effect and that each federal agency would administer
and enforce the regulations without the assistance or oversight of OPM.

The implementation of the new regulations

was stayed on November 23, 1983, however, by the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia,4 and that
stay was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on April 27, 1984.1
In the Continuing Appropriations Act for 1985, enacted in
October 1984, Congress extended the restrictions on the
implementation of the new regulations but specifically provided that the restrictions "shall expire on July 1, 1985."

judgment of the District Court and declared that the new regulations were

Opinion in Chambers

Pub. L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 1963, incorporating by reference
provisions of H. R. Rep. 98-993, p. 13 (1984).
On June 28, 1985-some eight months after Congress had
finally fixed the date on which the new regulations would
become effective and fewer than 72 hours before that effective date-respondent sought a temporary restraining order
blocking implementation of the new regulations from the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia.
In an opinion delivered from the bench the same day, the District Court denied the requested order, noting that respondent had failed to show that irreparable harm would result
from denial of the temporary restraining order. The court
found that nothing "of any concrete nature [would occur] in
the immediately foreseeable future which would be unable to
be redressed in some form or another at some later time
should the regulations go into effect."
Respondent appealed the decision of the District Court to
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and,
at the same time, moved the Court of Appeals to enjoin implementation of the new regulations. On Saturday, June 29,
1985, a motions panel of the Court of Appeals ordered that
respondent's emergency motion for injunctive relief be "held
in abeyance" and that the District Court hear and decide by
July 10, 1985, "any motion for a preliminary injunction."
The court ordered "on its own motion," that the effective
date of the proposed regulations be stayed until further order
of that court. The court observed that respondent "may suffer irreparable injury in the absence of a stay" but did not
identify that irreparable injury.
On July 2, 1985, OPM filed with me, as Circuit Justice for
the District of Columbia Circuit, an application to vacate the
order of the Court of Appeals. I granted the application on
July 3, reciting in my order that a memorandum opinion
would follow.
The Court of Appeals correctly acknowledged that the
established rule is that denials of temporary restraining or-

ders are ordinarily not appealable. The court nonetheless
asserted jurisdiction over the District Court's denial of the
temporary restraining order in this case, holding that it falls
within an exception to the general rule "because ... [the new
regulations] are now scheduled to become effective before
any hearing on the preliminary injunction can be held." The
court reasoned that because a hearing could not be held before the regulations went into effect, the District Court's denial of the temporary restraining order was tantamount to
a denial of a preliminary injunction.
The principal authority relied on by the Court of Appeals in
support of this exception to the general rule of unappealability is a footnote in our opinion in Sampson v. Murray, 415
U. S. 61, 86-87, n. 58 (1974).6 The footnote from Sampson
cited by the Court of Appeals merely quotes an opinion of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Pan American
World Airways v. Flight Engineers' Assn., 306 F. 2d 840,
843 (1962), to the effect that a temporary restraining order
which is continued beyond the statutory period is appealable
because it is, in effect, a preliminary injunction. In the
present case, however, the District Court denied the temporary restraining order; a temporary restraining order was,
therefore, not continued beyond the statutory period. The
footnote in Sampson relied on by the Court of Appeals is
simply irrelevant.
The Court of Appeals also relied on its own opinion in
Adams v. Vance, 187 U. S. App. D. C. 41, 570 F. 2d 950
(1978), but this reliance is also misplaced. In Adams, the
Court of Appeals held that it had jurisdiction over an appeal
'In Sampson, we reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit which upheld a temporary injunction barring
the dismissal of a federal employee. We held that loss of income to a
dismissed federal employee, even when coupled with damage to reputation
resulting from such dismissal, "falls far short of the type of irreparable
injury which is a necessary predicate to the issuance of a temporary injunction in this type of case." 415 U. S., at 91-92.

from a grant of a temporary restraining order because the
order in question "did not merely preserve the status quo
pending further proceedings, but commanded an unprecedented action irreversibly altering" a delicate balance involving the foreign relations of the United States. Id., at 44, 570
F. 2d, at 953. Again, however, in contrast to Adams, the
District Court in this case denied the temporary restraining
order. Its denial merely allows implementation of regulations in accordance with the express intent of Congress.
Only if the District Court granted the temporary restraining
order would it have disturbed the status quo. Moreover, the
District Court's grant of a temporary restraining order in
Adams was extraordinary. It "deeply intrude[d] into the
core concerns of the executive branch," id., at 45, 570 F. 2d,
at 954, and "direct[ed] action ... potent with consequences
...irretrievable," id., at 44, 570 F. 2d, at 953. The consequences of the District Court's order in the present case were
not nearly so grave. And the opinion of the District Court
explicitly contemplated a prompt hearing on a preliminary
injunction. The District Court's denial of the temporary
restraining order here was not in any sense a de facto denial
of a preliminary injunction. 7
The exception fashioned and relied on by the Court of Appeals is not supported by the authority cited; nor is there any
independent basis on which jurisdiction could rest. I therefore conclude that the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction
to review the denial by the District Court of respondent's
motion for a temporary restraining order. The Court of
Appeals should have dismissed the appeal, thereby allowing
respondent to proceed in the District Court on a motion for
a preliminary injunction.
'The Court of Appeals also cited to Dilworth v. Riner, 343 F. 2d 226,
229-230 (CA5 1965), to support its conclusion that, because the regulations
would become effective before a preliminary injunction hearing could be
held, the District Court's ruling was immediately appealable. Dilworth
simply does not support this conclusion.

1306

OCTOBER TERM, 1984
Opinion in Chambers

473 U. S.

Possibly to ensure that it would retain jurisdiction over the
disposition of the preliminary injunction motion which it ordered the District Court to hear and decide, the panel "held
in abeyance" the motion for injunctive relief and issued what
it termed an "administrative stay," in effect granting respondent more extensive relief than it had sought from the
District Court. However, since the Court of Appeals was
without jurisdiction over the appeal from the District Court's
order denying the temporary restraining order, the motions
panel was necessarily without authority to grant such a stay.
Accordingly, the order of the Court of Appeals is vacated.
