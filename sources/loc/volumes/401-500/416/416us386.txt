LEHMAN BROTHERS v. SCHEIN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

No. 73-439.

Argued March 19, 1974-Decided April 29, 1974*

Shareholders' derivative diversity suits were brought in federal
court in New York, alleging that the president of a Florida
corporation as a fiduciary, with others, used inside information
about projected corporate earnings for proft and hence was-liable
to the corporation for the unlawful profits. The District Court,
looking to New York's choice-of-law rules, held that under Florida
law, which it held governed, the defendants were not liable, and
dismissed the complaints. The Court of Appeals reversed, finding
that Florida law, "though controlling, was not decisive, and that
in this situation, Florida "would probably" apply a certain New
York decision to impose liability. Held: While resort to an
!,xailable certification procedure, such as is available in Florida,
is not-obligatory where there is doubt as to local law, and its use
in a given case is discretionary, resort to such procedure seems
particularly appropriate here in view of the novelty of the
question, the unsettled state of Florida law, and the fact that when
federal judges in New York attempt to predict uncertain Florida
law, they act as "outsiders" not exposed to lQcal law. Hence, the
case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to reconsider whether
the controlling issue of state law should be certified to the Florida
Supreme Court. Pp. 389-392.

Opinion of the Court

Banfield were on the brief for petitioner in No. 73-440.
James V. Hayes, John E. Tobin, Richard Y. Holcomb,
and Allan R. Freedman were on the briefs for petitioners
in No. 73-495.
Donald N. Ruby argued the cause for all respondents.
With him on the brief were Benedict Wolf, Edward A.
Berman, and Victor P. Muskin.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the
Court.
These cases are here on petitions for ;3ertiorari and
raise one identical question.
These are suits brought in the District Court for the
Southern District of New York. Lum's, one of the
respondents in the Lehman Bros. petition, is a Florida
corporation with headquarters in Miami. Each bf the
three petitions, which we consolidated for oral argument
involves shareholders' derivative suits naming Lum's and
others as defendants; and the basis of federal jurisdiction
is diversity of citizenship, 28 U. S. C. § 1332 (a)(1),
about which there is no dispute.
The complaints allege that Chasen, president of Lune's,
called Simon, a representative of Lehman Bros., and told
him about disappointing projections of Lum's earnings,
estimates that were confidential, not public. Simon is
said to have told an employee of IDS 1 about them.
On the next day, it is alleged that the ID8 defendants sold
1 Investors Diversified Services, Inc., Investors Variable Payment
Fund, Inc., and IDS New Dimensions Fund, Inc., were defendants
in the Schein case. Of those, only Investors Diversified Services,
Inc., is a defendant in the other derivative action brought by
Gregorio. The dismissal of the third derivative action (Gildenhorn)
was not pursued on appeal.
One Sit and one Jundt, defendants alleged to be employees of IDS,
Inc., were dismissed from the case by the District Court for lack
of personal jurisdiction. There was no appeal from that dismissal.

83,000 shares of Lum's on the New York Stock Exchange
for about $17.50 per share. Later that day the exchanges'
halted trading in Lum's stock and on the neAt trading day
it opened at $14 per share, the public being told that the,
projected earnings Would be "substantially lower" than
anticipated. The theory of the complaints was that
Chasen was a fiduciary but used the inside information
along with others for profit and that Chasen and his
group are liable to Lum's for their unlawful profits.
Lehman and Simon defended on the ground that the
IDS sale was not made through them and that neither
one benefited from the sales. Nonetheless plaintiffs
claimed that Chasen and the other defendants were liable
under Diamond v. Oreamuno;24 N. Y. 2d 494, 248 N. E.
2d 910 (1969): Diamond proceeds on the theory that
"inside" information of an officer or director of a corporation is an asset of the corporation which had been
acquired by th insiders as fiduciaries of the company
and misappropi' ted in violation of trust.
The District Court looked to the choice-of-law rules
of the State of New York, Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric
Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487,(1941), and held that the law of
the State of incorporation governs the existence and extent of corporate fiduciary obligations, as well As the liability for violation of them. Diamond did, indeed, so
indicate, 24 N. Y. 2d, at 503-504, 248 .N;: E. 2d, at 915.
The-)istrict Court in examiningFlorida law concluded'
that, dthough the highest court in .Flrid&has not considered the question, several district courts of'appeal
indicate that a complaint which fails to allege both
wrongful gcts and damage to the corporation must be
dismissed.2 The District Court went on to consider
-whether 'if Florida followed the Diamond rationale,
defendants would be liable. It concluded that the

Opinion of the Court

present complaints go beyoind Diamond, as Chasen, the
.only fiduciary of Lum's involved in the suits, never sold
any of his holdings on the basis of inside information.
The other defendants were not fiduciaries of Lum's 3
The District Court accordingly dismissed the complaints,
335 F. Supp. 329 (1971).
The Court of Appeals by a divided vote reversed the
District Court. 478 F. 2d 817 (CA2 1973). While the
Court of Appeals held that Florida law was controlling,
it found none that was decisive. So it then turned to the
law of other jurisdictions, particularly that of New York,
to see if Florida "would probably" interpret Diamond to
make if applicable here. The Court of Appeals concluded that the defendants had engaged with Chasen
"to misuse corporate property," id.,. at 822, and that
the theory of Diamond reaches that situation, "viewing the case as the Florida court would probably
view it." Ibid. There were emanations from other
Florida decisions4 that madie the riiajority on the
Court of Appeals feel that • Florida would follow that
reading of Diamond. Such a construction of Diamond,
the Court of Appeals said, would have "the prophylactic
effect of providing a disincentive to insider trading."
Id., at 823. And so it would. Yet under the regime of
Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), a State can
make just the opposite her law, providing there is no overriding federal rule which pre-empts state law by reason
of federal curbs on trading in the stream of commerce.
The, dissenter on the Court of Appeals urged that
that court certify the state-law question to the Florida
Supreme Court as is provided in Fla. Stat. Ann. § 25.031
3 The District Court also held that whether Chasen would be liable
not for profiting himself from the inside information but for revealing
it to others could not be reached as Chasen, a nonresident of New
York, had not been properly served.

path is open to this Court and to any court of appeals
of the United States. We have, indeed, used it before
as have coi'rts of appeals.'.
Moreover when state law does not make the certification procedure available,7 a federal court not infrequently
will stay its hand, remitting the parties to the state court
to resolve the controlling state law on which the federal
rule may turn. Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W. S. Ranch Co.,
391 U. S. 593 (1968). Numerous applications of that
practice are reviewed in Meredith v. Winter Haven, 320
U. S.228 (1943), which teaches that the mere difficulty
in ascertaining local law is no excuse for rpmitting the
parties to a state tribunal for the start of another lawsuit.
We do not suggest that where there is doubt as to local
law and where the certification procedure is available,

frequent state court repudiation of its interpretations of state law.

resort to it is obligatory. It does, of course, in the long
run save time, energy, and resources and helps build a
cooperative judicial federalismi.8 Its use in a given case
rests in the sound discretion of the federal court.
Here resort to it would seem particularly appropriate
in view of the novelty of the question and the great unsettlement of Florida law, Florida being a distant State.
When federal judges in New York attempt to predict
uncertain Florida law, they act, Is we have referred to
ourselves on this Court in matters of state law, as "outsiders" lacking the common exposure to local law which
comes from sitting in the jurisdiction.
".Reading the Texas statutes and the Texas decisions
as outsiders without special competence in Tfxas
law, we would have little confidence in our independent judgment regarding the application of that law to
the present situation. The lower court did deny
that the Texas statutes sustained the Commission's
assertion of power. And this represents the view of
an able and experienced circuit judge of the circuit
which includes Texas and of two capable district
judges trained in Texas law." Railroad Comm'n v.

The Court says that use of state court certification
procedures by federal courts "does, of course, in the long
run save time, energy, and resources and helps build a
cooperative judicial federalism." Ante, at 391. It also
observes that "[w]e do not suggest that where there is
doubt as to local law and where the certification procedure is available, resort to it is obligatory," ante, at 390391, and further states that "[i]ts use in a given case rests
in the sound discretion of the federal court." Ante, at
391. I agree with each of these propositions,, but I think
it appropriate to emphasize the scope of the discretion of
federal judges in deciding whether to use such certification
procedures.
Petitioners here were defendantg in the District Court.
That court, applying applicable New York choice-of-law
rules, decided that Florida law governs the case and,
finding that the respondents' complaint requested relief
which would extend the substantive law even beyond
New York's apparently novel decision in Diamond
v. Oreamuno, 24 N. Y. 2d 494, 248 N. E. 2d 910
(1969), dismissed the complaint on the merits. The
Court of Appeals agreed that Florida law applied, but
held that Florida law .vould permit recovery on the
claim stated by respondents. 'The opinion of the
'dissenting judge of the Court of Appeals, disagreeing
with the majority's analysis of Florida law, added in a
concluding paragraph that in light of the uncertainty
of Florida law, the Florida certification procedure should
have been utilized by .e Court of Appeals. On rehearMR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

ing, petitioners requested the Court of Appeals to utilize
this procedure, but they concede that this is the first such
request that they made. Thus petitioners seek to
upset the result of more than two years of trial and
appellate litigation on the basis of a point which they
first presented to the Court of Appeals upon petition for
rehearing. Cf. Hostetter v. Idlewild Liquor Corp., 377
U. S. 324, 329 (1964).
The authority which Congress has granted this Court
to review judgments of the courts of appeals undoubtedly
vests us not only with the authority to correct errors of
substantive law, but to prescribe the method by which
those courts go about deciding the cases before them.
Western Pacific Railroad Case, 345 U. S. 247 (1953).
But a sensible respect for the experience and competence
of the various integral parts of the federal judicial system
suggests that we go slowly in telling the courts of appeals
or the district courts how to go about deciding cases where
federal jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship,
cases which they see and decide far more often than
we do.
This Court has held that a federal court may not remit
a diversity plaintiff to state courts merely because of the
difficulty in ascertaining local law, Meredith v. Winter
Haven, 320 U. S. 228 (1943); it has also held that
unusual circumstances may require a federal court having jurisdiction of an action to nonetheless abstain from
deciding doubtful questions of state law, e. g., Louisiana
Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U. S. 25
(1959); Kaiser Steel Corp. v. W. S. Ranch Co., 391 U. S.
593 (1968) (per curiam). In each of these situations,
our decisions have dealt with the issue of how to reconcile
the exercise of the jurisdiction which Congress has conferred upon the federal courts with the important considerations of comity and cooperative federalism which

are inherent in a federal system, both of which must be
subject to a single national policy within the federal
judiciary.
At the other end of the spectrum, however, I assume
it would be unthinkable to any of the Members of this
Court to prescribe the process by which a district court
or a court of appeals should go about researching a point
of state law which arises in a diversity case. Presumably
the judges of the district coul-ts and of the. courts of
appeals are at least as capable as we are in determining
what the Florida courts have said about a particular
question of Florida law.
State certification procedures are a very desirable
means by which a federal court may ascertain an
undecided point of state law, especially where, as is the
case in Florida, the question can be certified directly.
to the court of last resort within the State. But in a
purely diversity case such as this one, the use of such
a procedure is more a question of the considerable
discretion of the federal court in going about' the
decisionmaking process than it is a question of a choice
trenching upon the fundamentals of our federal-state
jurisprudence.
While certification may engender less delay and create
fewer additional expenses for litigants than would abstention, it entails more delay and expense than would -an

the federal court. See Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, 363
U. S. 207, 226-227 (1960) (dissenting opinion). The Supreme Court of Florida has promulgated an appellate
rule, Fla. Appellate Rule 4.61 (1967),. which provides that
upon certification by a federal court to that court, the
parties shall file briefs there according to a specified briefing schedule, that oral argument may be. granted upon
application, and that the parties shall pay -thecosts of the

Thus while the. certification procedure is

more likely to produce the correct determination

of

state law, additional time and money are required to
achieve such a determination.

If a. district court or court of appeals believes that it
can resolve an issue of state law with available research
materials already at hand, and makes the effort to do so,
its determination should not be disturbed simply because
the certification procedure existed but was not used.
The question of whether certification on the facts of
this case, particularly in view of the lateness of its sug-

gestion by petitioners, would have advanced the goal of
correctly disposing of this 'litigation on the state law
issue is one which I would leave, and I understand thatthe Court would leave, to the sound judgment of the
court making the initial choice. But since the Court has
today for the first time expressed its view as to the use of
certification procedures by the federal courts, I agree

that it is appropriate to vacate the judgrfient of the Court
of Appeals and remand the cases in order that the Court

of Appeals may reconsider certification in light of the
Court's opinion.
*Fla. Appellate Rule 4.61 (1967) provides in part:
"f. Costs of Certificate. The costs of the certificate and filing
fee shall be equally divided between the parties unless otherwise
ordered by this Court.
"g. Briefs and Argument. The appellant or moving party in the
federal court shall file and serve upon its adversary its brief on the
question certified within 30 days after the filing of said certificate
in the appellate court of this state having jurisdiction. The appellee
or responding party in the federal court shall file and serve upon
its adversary its brief within 20 days after the receipt of appellant's
or moving party's brief and a reply brief shall be filed within 10 days
thereafter.
"h. Oral Argument. Oral argument may be granted upon application and, unless for good cause shown the time be enlarged by
special order of the Court prior to the hearing thereon, the parties
shall be allowed the came time as in other causes on the merits."
