v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 73-641.

Argued April 16, 1974-Decided May 13, 1974

Petitioner Edwin A. Snow, who had advanced part of the capital in a
partnership formed in 1966 to develop a special-purpose incinerator
and had become a limited partner, was disallowed a deduction
under § 174 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, on
his individual income tax return for that year for his pro rata
share of the partnership's operating loss. Though there were no
sales in 1966, expectations were high and the inventor-partner
was giving about a third of his time to the project, an outside engineering firm doing the shopwork. The Tax Court and the Court
* f Appeals both upheld disallowance of the deduction, which
§ 174 (a) (1) provides for "experimental expenditures which are
paid or incurred by [the taxpayer] during the taxable year in
connection with his trade or business as expenses which are not
chargeable to capital account." Held. It was error to disallow the
deduction, which was "in connection with" petitioner's trade or
business, and the disallowance was contrary to the broad legislative objective of the Congress when it enacted § 174 to provide an
economic incentive, especially for small and growing businesses,
to engage in the search for new products and new inventions.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Section 174 (a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, 26 U. S. C. § 174 (a) (1), allows a taxpayer to take
as a deduction "experimental expenditures which are paid
or incurred by him during the taxable year in connection
with his trade or business as expenses which are not
chargeable to capital account." Petitioner Edwin A.
Snow (hereafter petitioner) was disallowed as a deduction his distributive share of the net operating loss of
a partnership, Burns Investment Company, for the taxable year 1966. The United States Tax Court sustained
the Commissioner, 58 T. C. 585. The Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit affirmed, 482 F. 2d 1029 (1973).
The case is here on a writ of certiorari because of an

apparent conflict between that court. and the Fourth Circuit in Cleveland v. Commissioner, 297 F. 2d 169 (1961).
Petitioner was a limited partner in Burns, having contributed $10,000 for a four-percent interest in Burns.
The general partner was one Trott who had previously
formed two other limited partnerships, one called Echo,
to develop a telephone answering device and the other
Courier, to develop an electronic tape recorder. Petitioner had become a limited partner in each of these
other partnerships.'
*Charles H. Phillips and Ronald L. Blanc, pro se, filed a brief as
amici curiae.

Echo and Courier claimed research and development ex-

penses in 1965 and 1966; and they were not challenged by the
Commissioner, apparently because their products were in a more

Burns wag formed to develop "a special purpose incinerator for the consumer and industrial markets."
Trott was the inventor and had conceived of this idea in
1964 and between then and 1966 had made a number of
prototypes. His patent counsel had told him in 1965
that several features of the burner were in his view
patentable but in 1966 advised him that the incinerator
as a whole had not been sufficiently "reduced to practice"
in order to develop it into a marketable product. At
that point Trott formed Burns, petitioner putting up
part of the capital. Thereafter various models of the
burner were built and tested.
During 1966 Burns reported no sales of the incinerator
or any other product but expectations were high; and
Trott was giving about one-third of his time to the project, an outside engineering firm doing the shopwork. Trott obtained a patent on the incinerator in 1970, and
it is currently being produced and marketed under the
name Trash-Away.3
Section 174 was enacted in 1954 to dilute some of
the conception of "ordinary and necessary" business
expenses under § 162(a) (then § 23 (a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) adumbrated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a concurring opinion in Deputy v.
Du Pont, 308 U. S. 488, 499 (1940), where he said that
advanced siage of development and were available for sale or
licensing.
2 Treasury Regulation § 1.174-2 (a) (2)
provides: "The provisions
of this section apply not only to costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for research or. experimentation undertaken directly by him
but also to expenditures paid or incurred for research or experimentation carried on in his behalf by another person or organization
(such as . . . [an] engineering company, or similar contractor). ..

1970 Burns was incorporated and it produces and
markets Trasli-Away, petitioner being its Chairman of the Board.

the section in question (old § 23 (a)) "invofves holding one's self out to others as engaged in the selling of
goods or services." The words "trade or business" appear, however, in about 60 different sections of the 1954
Act.4 Those other sections are not helpful here because
Congress wrote. into. § 174 (a)(1) "in connection with,"
and § 162 (a) is more narrowly written than is § 174,
allowing "a deduction" of "ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred . . .in carrying on any trade or
business." That and other sections are not helpful here.
The legislative history makes fairly clear the reasons. Established firms with ongoing business had
continuous programs of research quite unlike small or
piorieering business enterprises.' Mr. Reed of New York,
Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means,
made the point even more explicit when he addressed the
House on the bill:
"Present law contains no statutory provision doaling expressly with the deduction of these expenses.
The result has been confusion and uncertainty.
Very often, under present law small businesses which
are developing new products and do not have established research departments are not allowed to deduct these exlenses despite the fact that their large
and well-established competitors can obtain the deduction. . . . This provision will greatly stimulate
the' search for new products and new inventions upon
which the future economic and military strength of
our Nation depends.. It will be particularly valuable

(Emphasis

Congress may at times in its wisdom discriminate taxwise between various kinds of business, between old and
oncoming business and the like. But we would defeat
the congressional purpose somewhat to equalize the tax
benefits of the ongoing companies and those that are
upcoming and about to reach the market by perpetuating
the discrimination created below and urged upon us
here.
We read § 174 as did the Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit in Cleveland "to encourage expenditure
for research and experimentation." 297 F. 2d, at 173.
-That incentive is embedded in § 174 because of "in connection with," making irrelevant whether petitioners-were
rich or poor.
We are invited to explore the treatment of "hobbylosses" under § 183. But that is far afield of the present
inquiry for it is clear that in this case under § 174 the
profit motive was the sole drive of the venture.
Reversed.
