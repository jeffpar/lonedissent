OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE

CALIFORNIA v. AMERICAN STORES COMPANY
ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-151.

Decided August 22, 1989

The request of applicant, the State of California, for a stay of the Court of
Appeals' mandate is granted, pending disposition of its petition for a writ
of certiorari and conditioned upon the posting of a bond with the Clerk of
the District Court. The State, through its attorney general on behalf of
himself and as parens patriae, filed in the District Court an action as a
private plaintiff to enjoin the merger of respondents, the largest and
fourth largest retail grocery chains in the State, contending that the
merger would lessen competition in the relevant market in violation of
the Clayton and Sherman Acts and state law. The court granted the
motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered respondents to operate
independently and to refrain from merging or integrating their assets
and businesses during the pendency of the action. The Court of Appeals
remanded, finding, inter alia, that the order enjoining respondents from
integrating their operations amounted to indirect divestiture, a remedy
not available to private plaintiffs under the Clayton Act. However, it
granted a stay of its mandate to allow the State to file a petition for a
writ of certiorari. The District Court conditioned the stay on the posting of a bond. The State declined to post the bond, and the Court of
Appeals vacated its stay and ordered issuance of the mandate. The
State has set forth sufficient reasons for granting a stay. It has made
an adequate showing of irreparable injury, since other appropriate injunctive relief may be inadequate to remedy the injury. There is also
a reasonable probability that the petition will be granted, given the
conflict among the lower courts on the important and recurring issue
whether divestiture constitutes injunctive relief within the meaning of
the Clayton Act and the need for uniform enforcement of federal antitrust laws. Moreover, the fact that the weight of academic authority
favors a reading of the Act that would permit divestiture as a remedy in
private actions stiggests that there is at least a fair prospect that a
1301

majority of the Court will vote to reverse the decision below. Finally,
the equities favor the State, since the harm of a substantial lessening of
competition in the relevant market outweighs the harm that respondents
may suffer as the result of the stay.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, Circuit Justice.

Applicant, the State of California, requests a stay of the

mandate of the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, pending disposition of its petition

for a writ of certiorari.
Applicant, through its attorney general on behalf of himself and as parens patriae, brought the underlying action
as a private plaintiff to enjoin the merger of respondent

Lucky Stores, Inc., the largest retail grocery chain in California, and respondent American Stores Company, operator
of Alpha Beta, the fourth largest retail grocery chain in California.* Applicant contends that the merger would substantially lessen competition in the relevant markets, in violation of § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended,
15 U. S. C. § 18, § 1 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as

amended, 15 U. S. C. § 1, and California's Cartwright Anti*American Stores initiated a hostile takeover bid for the Lucky chain on
March 21, 1988. Pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 1390, 15 U. S. C. § 18a, American Stores notified the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of its intentions. On May 23,
American Stores increased its tender offer, and Lucky's board of directors
approved the meiger. On May 31, the FTC filed an administrative complaint alleging violations of § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as
amended, 15 U. S. C. § 18, and § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act,
38 Stat. 719, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 45. The FTC simultaneously proposed a consent order under which it would settle its antitrust complaint in
exchange for American Stores' compliance with certain demands, including
divestiture of certain supermarkets in northern California and an agreement to "hold separate" the two firms until American Stores satisfied all of
the consent order's conditions. American Stores agreed to the consent
order, and by June 9 completed its $2.5 billion acquisition of the outstanding Lucky stock. On August 31, the FTC gave final approval to the proposed consent order without modification. On September 1, applicant initiated the underlying action.

trust and Unfair Competition Acts, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
Ann. §§ 16700-16761 and 17200-17208 (West 1987 and Supp.
1989).
The District Court granted applicant's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered respondents to operate the two
companies independently and refrain from merging or integrating their assets and businesses during the pendency of
the action. 697 F. Supp. 1125 (CD Cal. 1988). The court
concluded:
"The overwhelming statistical evidence has demonstrated a strong probability that the proposed merger
will substantially lessen competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act. This showing has not been
rebutted by clear evidence that the proposed merger will
not, in fact, substantially lessen competition ....
[U]nless defendants are enjoined, the citizens of California
will be substantially and irreparably harmed. While the
Court in no way belittles the harm defendants may suffer as a result of this preliminary injunction, the Court
concludes that it is substantially less than the harm
plaintiff would suffer if the merger is not enjoined."
Id., at 1135.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part
and reversed and remanded in part. 872 F. 2d 837 (1989).
The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's finding
that applicant had shown a likelihood of success on the merits
and the possibility of irreparable harm. Id., at 844. The
Court of Appeals found, however, that the remedy ordered
by the -District Court amounted to indirect divestiture,
which, the Court of Appeals held, was not a remedy available
to private plaintiffs under § 16 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat.
737, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §26. 872 F. 2d, at 844-846.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded the case, concluding that the District Court's order enjoining respondents
from integrating their operations was overly broad and thus
an abuse of discretion. Id., at 845-846.

492 U. S.

The Court of Appeals denied applicant's petition for rehearing and rehearing en bane, but granted a stay of its mandate for 30 days to enable applicant to file a petition for a writ
of certiorari with this Court. The Court of Appeals also partially remanded the case to the District Court to determine
whether, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure
41(b), a bond or other security or condition should be required of applicant as a condition of the stay. The District
Court ordered applicant to post an initial bond of $16,288,898
to protect respondents against potential financial losses as a
result of the stay of mandate. Applicant, claiming budgetary and administrative impossibility, declined to post the
bond and appealed the bond order. The Court of Appeals
consequently vacated its stay and ordered issuance of the
mandate.
In its application for a stay of the mandate pending this
Court's disposition of its petition for certiorari, applicant contends that the Court of Appeals' bond requirement amounts
to a denial of a stay and will result in irreparable harm to the
State's consumers because of the merger's anticompetitive
effects. Applicant also maintains that there is both a reasonable probability that its petition for a writ of certiorari will be
granted, because the case presents an issue of great importance on which there is a conflict among the Circuits, and a
fair prospect that applicant will prevail on the merits. Finally, applicant asserts that the equities justify a stay of the
Court of Appeals' mandate.
I am persuaded that applicant has set forth sufficient reasons for granting a stay in this case. I agree with both the
District Court and the Court of Appeals that applicant has
made an adequate showing of irreparable injury. See 872 F.
2d, at 844 (lessening of competition "is precisely the kind of
irreparable injury that injunctive relief under section 16 of
the Clayton Act was intended to prevent") (citations omitted); 697 F. Supp., at 1134. Even if applicant is free to seek

CALIFORNIA v. AMERICAN STORES CO.
1301

Opinion in Chambers

other appropriate injunctive relief on remand, the possibility
of irreparable injury, it seems to me, remains to the extent
that such other relief would be inadequate to remedy the
injury. Cf. 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 328b,
p. 137 (1978) ("[D]ivestiture is the normal and usual remedy
against an unlawful merger, whether sued by the government or by a private plaintiff").
Moreover, the issue presented appears to be an important
question of federal law over which the Circuits are in conflict.
Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part that
"[a]ny person.., shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief ... against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws ... when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened
conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of
equity." 15 U. S. C. § 26. The Court of Appeals, relying on
Circuit precedent, held that divestiture, whether direct or indirect, did not constitute "injunctive relief" within the meaning of § 16. See 872 F. 2d, at 844-846 (citing International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp. v. General Telephone & Electronics Corp., 518 F. 2d 913, 920 (CA9 1975)); accord, Arthur
S. Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co., 729 F. 2d 1050,
1060 (CA6), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1036 (1984). As applicant notes, however, the Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit has ruled that divestiture is a remedy available to
private plaintiffs under § 16 in appropriate circumstances.
Compania Petrolera Caribe, Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc.,
754 F. 2d 404, 413-430 (1985); see also NBO Industries
Treadway Cos. v. Brunswick Corp., 523 F. 2d 262, 278-279
(CA3 1975) (dictum), vacated on other grounds, 429 U. S. 477
(1977). A number of District Courts have also reached the
same conclusion. See, e. g., Tasty Baking Co. v. Ralston
Purina, Inc., 653 F. Supp. 1250, 1255-1256 (ED Pa. 1987);
Julius Nasso Concrete Corp. v. Dic Concrete Corp., 467 F.
Supp. 1016, 1024-1025 (SDNY 1979); Credit Bureau Reports,

Inc. v. Retail Credit Co., 358 F. Supp. 780, 797 (SD Tex.
1971), aff'd, 476 F. 2d 989 (CA5 1973); Bay GuardianCo. v.
Chronicle Publishing Co., 340 F. Supp. 76, 81-82 (ND Cal.
1972). Given the conflict among the lower courts on this
important and recurring issue and the need for uniform enforcement of federal antitrust laws, I think it fair to say that
there is a reasonable probability that the petition for a writ of
certiorari will be granted in this case.
Indeed, the weight of academic commentary favors a reading of § 16 that would permit divestiture as a remedy in private actions. See, e. g., 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust
Law § 328b, p. 137 (1978) ("[D]ivestiture is available in a private suit challenging unlawful mergers"); P. Areeda & H.
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 328b, pp. 290-291 (Supp. 1988)
(approving Petrolera,supra); E. Kintner, Primer on the Law
of Mergers 361-364 (1973) (divestiture is available in private
actions under § 16); L. Sullivan, Law of Antitrust § 216,
p. 672, n. 3 (1977) (same); Kintner & Wilberding, Enforcement of the Merger Laws by Private Party Litigation, 47
Ind. L. J. 293 (1972); Peacock, Private Divestiture Suits
Under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 48 Texas L. Rev. 54
(1969); Comment, Private Divestiture: Antitrust's Latest
Problem Child, 41 Ford. L. Rev. 569 (1973); Note, The Use
of Divestiture in Private Antitrust Suits, 43 Geo. Wash. L.
Rev. 261 (1974); Note, Availability of Divestiture in Private
Litigation as a Remedy for Violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 49 Minn. L. Rev. 267 (1965); Comment, Section 16 of
the Clayton Act: Divestiture an Intended Type of Injunctive
Relief, 19 Pac. L. J. 143 (1987). Although I cannot, of
course, predict with mathematical certainty my colleagues'
views on the subject, see New Motor Vehicle Board v. Orrin
W. Fox Co., 434 U. S. 1345, 1347 (1977) (REHNQUIST, J., in
chambers), this commentary suggests to me that plausible arguments exist for reversing the decision below and that there
is at least a fair prospect that a majority of the Court may
vote to do so. Cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Re-

CALIFORNIA v. AMERICAN STORES CO.
1301

1307

Opinion in Chambers

search, Inc., 395 U. S. 100, 130-131 (1969) ("Section 16
should be construed and applied... with the knowledge that
the remedy it affords, like other equitable remedies, is flexible and capable of nice 'adjustment and reconciliation between the public interest and private needs as well as between competing private claims.'. . . Its availability should
be 'conditioned by the necessities of the public interest which
Congress has sought to protect"') (citation omitted).
Finally, balancing the stay equities persuades me that the
harm to applicant if the stay is denied, in the form of a substantial lessening of competition in the relevant market, outweighs the harm respondents may suffer as a result of a stay
of the mandate. Applicant alleges, for example, that permitting the merger would cost the State's consumers $400 million a year in higher prices. Respondents contend that they
are incurring costs of over $1 million a week by reason of the
District Court's injunction and applicant's decision to file suit
after the merger had been consummated. To be sure, the
cost of enjoining a merger before consummation is staggering, see Western Airlines, Inc. v. Teamsters, 480 U. S. 1301,
1309 (1987) (O'CONNOR, J., in chambers), and the cost of enjoining an already completed transaction even greater. But,
as the District Court found, "the State conducted [its] investigation as swiftly as was responsibly possible." 697 F.
Supp., at 1135. Under the circumstances, and in light of the
public interests involved, it appears that the equities favor
applicant.
Because the citizens of California will likely suffer irreparable harm if integration of respondents' companies is not enjoined, and because there is both a reasonable probability
that at least four Justices will vote to grant the petition for
a writ of certiorari and a fair prospect that applicant may prevail on the merits, I grant the requested stay of the mandate
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in
this case, pending the disposition by this Court of the petition
for a writ of certiorari or further order of this Court.

This order is conditioned upon the posting of a good and
sufficient bond with the Clerk of the United States District
Court for the Central District of California, the adequacy of
such bond to be determined by that court.
