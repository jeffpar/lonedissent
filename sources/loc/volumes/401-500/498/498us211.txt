MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION & PRODUCING SOUTHEAST, INC., ET AL. v. UNITED DISTRIBUTION
COS. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 89-1452.

Argued November 5, 1990-Decided January 8, 1991*

In response to ongoing natural gas shortages, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA), which, inter alia, established higher
price ceilings for "new" gas in order to encourage production and carried
over the pre-existing system of "vintage" price ceilings for "old" gas in
order to protect consumers. However, recognizing that some of the
vintage ceilings might be too low, Congress, in § 104(b)(2) of the NGPA,
authorized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to raise them
whenever traditional pricing principles under the Natural Gas Act of
1938 (NGA) would dictate a higher price. After the new production incentives resulted in serious market distortions, the Commission issued
its Order No. 451, which, among other things, collapsed the existing vintage price categories into a single classification and set forth a single
new ceiling that exceeded the then-current market price for old gas; established a "Good Faith Negotiation" (GFN) procedure that producers
must follow before they can collect a higher price from current pipeline
customers, whereby producers may in certain circumstances abandon
their existing obligations if the parties cannot come to terms; and
rejected suggestions that the Commission undertake to resolve in the
Order No. 451 proceeding the issue of take-or-pay provisions in certain
gas contracts. Such provisions obligate a pipeline to purchase a specified volume of gas at a specified price, and, if it is unable to do so, to
pay for that volume. They have caused significant hardships for gas
purchasers under current market conditions. On review, the Court of
Appeals vacated Order No. 451, ruling that the Commission lacked authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas under § 104(b)(2) of the
NGPA; that the ceiling price actually set was unreasonable; that the
Commission lacked authority to provide for across-the-board, preauthorized abandonment under § 7(b) of the NGA; and that the Commission
should have addressed the take-or-pay issue in this proceeding, even
though it was considering the matter in a separate proceeding.
*Together with No. 89-1453, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
v. United DistributionCos. et al., also on certiorari to the same court.

Held: Order No. 451 does not exceed the Commission's authority under
the NGPA. Pp. 221-231.
(a) Section 104(b)(2) of the NGPA-which authorizes the Commission
to prescribe "a ... ceiling price, applicable to ... any natural gas
(or category thereof, as determined by the Commission) . . . ,if such
price" is (1) "higher than" the old vintage ceilings, and (2) "just and reasonable" under the NGA (emphasis added)-clearly and unambiguously
gives the Commission authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas.
The NGPA's structure-which created detailed incentives for new gas,
but carefully preserved the old gas vintaging scheme-does not require a
contrary conclusion, since the statute's bifurcated approach implies no
more than that Congress found the need to encourage new gas production sufficiently pressing to deal with the matter directly, but was content to leave old gas pricing within the Commission's discretion to alter
as conditions warranted. Further, the Commission's decision to set a
single ceiling fully accords with the two restrictions § 104(b)(2) does establish, since the "higher than" requirement does nothing to prevent the
Commission from consolidating existing categories and setting one price,
and since the "just and reasonable" requirement preserves the pricing
flexibility that the Commission historically exercised and accords the
Commission broad ratemaking authority that its decision to set a single
ceiling does not exceed. Respondents' contention that the Commission's
institution of the GFN process amounts to an acknowledgment of the unreasonableness of the new ceiling price is rejected, since there is nothing
incompatible in the belief that a price is reasonable and the belief that it
ought not to be imposed without prior negotiations. An otherwise lawful rate should not be disallowed because additional safeguards accompany it. Respondents' objection that no order "deregulating" the price
of old gas can be deemed just and reasonable is also rejected, since Order
No. 451 does not deregulate in any legally relevant sense, and it cannot
be concluded that deregulation results simply because a given ceiling
price may be above the market price. Pp. 221-226.
(b) Order No. 451's abandonment procedures fully comport with the
requirements of § 7(b) of the NGA, which, interalia, prohibits a gas producer from abandoning its contractual service obligations to a purchaser
unless the Commission has (1) granted its "permission and approval" of
the abandonment; (2) made a "finding" that "present or future public convenience or necessity permit such abandonment"; and (3) held a "hearing" that is "due." First, although Order No. 451's approval of the
abandonment at issue is not specific to any single abandonment but is
instead general, prospective, and conditional, nothing in § 7(b) prevents
the Commission from giving advance approval or mandates individualized proceedings involving interested parties before a specific abandon-

ment can take place. Second, in reviewing "all relevant factors involved
in determining the overall public interest," and in finding that preauthorized abandonment under the GFN regime would generally protect
purchasers, safeguard producers, and serve the market by releasing previously unused reserves of old gas, the Commission made the necessary
"finding" required by § 7(b), which does not compel the agency to make
"specific findings" with regard to every abandonment when the issues involved are general. Finally, the Commission discharged its § 7(b) duty
to hold a "due hearing," since, before promulgating Order No. 451, it
held a notice and comment hearing and an oral hearing. See, e. g.,
Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 467. United Gas Pipe Line Co. v.
McCombs, 442 U. S. 529, distinguished. Respondents cannot claim that
the Commission made no provision for individual determinations under
its abandonment procedures where appropriate, since Order No. 451 authorizes a purchaser objecting to a given abandonment on the grounds
that the conditions the agency has set forth have not been met to file a
complaint with the Commission. Pp. 226-229.
(c) The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the Commission had a
duty to address the take-or-pay problem more fully in this proceeding.
The court clearly overshot its mark if it meant to order the Commission
to resolve the problem, since an agency enjoys broad discretion in determining how best to handle related yet discrete issues in terms of
procedures, and it is likely that the Commission's separate proceeding
addressing the matter will generate relevant data more effectively.
The court likewise erred if it meant that the Commission should have
addressed the take-or-pay problem insofar as Order No. 451 "exacerbated" it, since an agency need not solve every problem before it in the
same proceeding, and the Commission has articulated rational grounds
for concluding that the order would do more to ameliorate the problem
than worsen it. This Court is neither inclined nor prepared to secondguess the Commission's reasoned determination in this complex area.

Opinion of the Court

496 U. S. 904 (1990). For the reasons that follow, we reverse and sustain the Commission's orders in their entirety.

I
The Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), 52 Stat. 821, 15
U. S. C. § 717 et seq., was Congress' first attempt to establish nationwide natural gas regulation. Section 4(a) mandated that the present Commission's predecessor, the Federal Power Commission,' ensure that all rates and charges
requested by a natural gas company for the sale or transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce be "just and reasonable." 15 U. S. C. § 717c(a). Section 5(a) further provided that the Commission order a "just and reasonable rate,
charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract"
connected with the sale or transportation of gas whenever it
determined that any of these standards or actions were "unjust" or "unreasonable." 15 U. S. C. § 717d(a).
Over the years the Commission adopted a number of different approaches in applying the NGA's "just and reasonable" standard. See Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y. v. MidLouisiana Gas Co., 463 U. S. 319, 327-331 (1983). Initially
the Commission, construing the NGA to regulate gas sales
only at the downstream end of interstate pipelines, proceeded on a company-by-company basis with reference to the
historical costs each pipeline operator incurred in acquiring
and transporting gas to its customers. The Court upheld
this approach in FPC v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S.
591 (1944), explaining that the NGA did not bind the Commission to "any single formula or combination of formulae in
determining rates." Id., at 602.
The Commission of necessity shifted course in response to
our decision in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347
U. S. 672 (1954). Phillips interpreted the NGA to require
that the Commission regulate not just the downstream rates
The term "Commission" will refer to both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and its predecessor, the Federal Power Commission.

charged by large interstate pipeline concerns, but also upstream sales rates charged by thousands of independent gas
producers. Id., at 682. Faced with the regulatory burden
that resulted, the Commission eventually opted for an "area
rate" approach for the independent producers while retaining the company-by-company method for the interstate pipelines. First articulated in 1960, the area rate approach
established a single rate schedule for all gas produced in a
given region based upon historical production costs and rates
of return. See Statement of General Policy No. 61-1, 24
F. P. C. 818 (1960). Each area rate schedule included a twotiered price ceiling: the lower ceiling for gas prices established in "old" gas contracts and a higher ceiling for gas prices
set in "new" contracts. Id., at 819. The new two-tiered
system was termed "vintage pricing" or "vintaging." Vintaging rested on the premise that the higher ceiling price for
new gas production would provide incentives that would be
superfluous for old gas already flowing because "price could
not serve as an incentive, and since any price above average
historical costs, plus an appropriate return, would merely
confer windfalls." Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390
U. S. 747, 797 (1968). The balance the Commission hoped to
strike was the development of gas production through the
''new" gas ceilings while ensuring continued protection of
consumers through the "old" gas price limits. At the same
time the Commission anticipated that the differences in price
levels would be "reduced and eventually eliminated as subsequent experience brings about revisions in the prices in the
various areas." Statement of General Policy, supra, at 819.
We upheld the vintage pricing system in Permian Basin,
holding that the courts lacked the authority to set aside any
Commission rate that was within the "'zone of reasonableness."' 390 U. S., at 797 (citation omitted).
By the early 1970's, the two-tiered area rate approach no
longer worked. Inadequate production had led to gas shortages which in turn had prompted a rapid rise in prices. Ac-

cordingly, the Commission abandoned vintaging in favor of a
single national rate designed to encourage production. Just
and Reasonable National Rates for Sales of Natural Gas, 51
F. P. C. 2212 (1974). Refining this decision, the Commission prescribed a single national rate for all gas drilled after
1972, thus rejecting an earlier plan to establish different national rates for succeeding biennial vintages. Just and Reasonable National Rates for Sales of Natural Gas, 52 F. P. C.
1604, 1615 (1974). But the single national pricing scheme did
not last long either. In 1976 the Commission reinstated vintaging with the promulgation of Order No. 770. National
Rates for JurisdictionalSales of Natural Gas, 56 F. P. C.
509. At about the same time, in Order No. 749, the Commission also consolidated a number of the old vintages for discrete areas into a single nationwide category for all gas already under production before 1973. Just and Reasonable
National Rates for Sales of Natural Gas, 54 F. P. C. 3090
(1975), aff'd sub nom. Texaco Oil Co. v. FERC, 571 F. 2d 834
(CA5), cert. dism'd, 439 U. S. 801 (1978).
Despite this
consolidation, the Commission's price structure still contained 15 different categories of old gas, each with its own
ceiling price. Despite all these efforts, moreover, severe
shortages persisted in the interstate market because low ceiling prices for interstate gas sales fell considerably below
prices the same gas could command in intrastate markets,
which were as yet unregulated.
Congress responded to these ongoing problems by enacting
the NGPA, the statute that controls this controversy. See
Mid-LouisianaGas Co., supra, at 330-331. The NGPA addressed the problem of continuing shortages in several ways.
First, it gave the Commission the authority to regulate
prices in the intrastate market as well as the interstate
market. See TranscontinentalGas Pipe Line Corp. v. State
Oil and Gas Bd. of Miss., 474 U. S. 409, 420-421 (1986)
(Transco). Second, to encourage production of new reserves, the NGPA established higher price ceilings for new

and hard-to-produce gas as well as a phased deregulation
scheme for these types of gas. §§ 102, 103, 105, 107 and 108;
15 U. S. C. §§ 3312, 3313, 3315, 3317, 3318. Finally, to safeguard consumers, §§ 104 and 106 carried over the vintage
price ceilings that happened to be in effect for old gas when
the NGPA was enacted while mandating that these be adjusted for inflation. 15 U. S. C. §§3314 and 3316. Congress, however, recognized that some of these vintage price
ceilings "may be too low and authorize[d] the Commission to
raise [them] whenever traditional NGA principles would dictate a higher price." Mid-LouisianaGas, 463 U. S., at 333.
In particular, §§ 104(b)(2) and 106(c) provided that the Commission "may, by rule or order, prescribe a maximum lawful
ceiling price, applicable to any first sale of any natural gas (or
category thereof, as determined by the Commission) otherwise subject to the preceding provisions of this section." 15
U. S. C. §§ 3314(b)(2) and 3316(c). The only conditions that
Congress placed on the Commission were, first, that the new
ceiling be higher than the ceiling set by the statute itself and,
second, that it be "just and reasonable" within the meaning of
the NGA. §§3314(b)(1), 3316(a).
The new incentives for production of new and hard-toproduce gas transformed the gas shortages of the 1970's into
gas surpluses during the 1980's. One result was serious
market distortions. The higher new gas price ceilings prevented the unexpected oversupply from translating into
lower consumer prices since the lower, vintage gas ceilings
led to the premature abandonment of old gas reserves.
App. 32-36. Accordingly, the Secretary of Energy in 1985
formally recommended that the Commission issue a notice of
proposed rulemaking to revise the old gas pricing system.
50 Fed. Reg. 48540 (1985). After conducting two days of
public hearings and analyzing approximately 113 sets of comments, the Commission issued the two orders under dispute
in this case: Order No. 451, promulgated in June 1986, 51
Fed. Reg. 22168 (1986); and Order No. 451-A, promulgated

MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION v. UNITED DISTRIBUTION
211

219

Opinion of the Court

in December 1986, which reaffirmed the approach of its
predecessor while making certain modifications. 2 51 Fed.
Reg. 46762 (1986).
The Commission's orders have three principal components.
First, the Commission collapsed the 15 existing vintage price
categories of old gas into a single classification and established an alternative maximum price for a producer of gas in
that category to charge, though only to a willing buyer. The
new ceiling was set at $2.57 per million Btu's, a price equal
to the highest of the ceilings then in effect for old gas (that
having the most recent, post-1974, vintage) adjusted for
inflation. 51 Fed. Reg. 22183-22185 (1986); see 18 CFR
§ 271.402(c)(3)(iii) (1986). When established the new ceiling
exceeded the then-current market price for old gas. The
Commission nonetheless concluded that this new price was
"just and reasonable" because, among other reasons, it generally approximated the replacement cost of gas based upon
the current cost of finding new gas fields, drilling new wells,
and producing new gas. See Shell Oil Co. v. FPC,520 F. 2d
1061 (CA5 1975) (holding that replacement cost formula appropriate for establishing "just and reasonable" rates under
the NGA), cert. denied, 426 U. S. 941 (1976).
In taking
these steps, the Commission noted that the express and unambiguous terms of §§ 104(b)(2) and 106(c) gave it specific authorization to raise old gas prices so long as the resulting ceiling met the just and reasonable requirement. 51 Fed. Reg.,
at 22179.
The second principal feature of the orders establishes a
"Good Faith Negotiation" (GFN) procedure that producers
must follow before they can collect a higher price from
current pipeline customers. 18 CFR § 270.201 (1986). The
GFN process consists of several steps. Initially, a producer
may request a pipeline to nominate a price at which the pipeline would be willing to continue purchasing old gas under
2

Order No. 451 shall refer to both orders where the distinction is not

relevant.

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

498 U. S.

any existing contract. § 270.201(b)(1). At the same time,
however, this request is also deemed to be an offer by the
producer to release the purchaser from any contract between
the parties that covers the sale of old gas. § 270.201(b)(4).
In response, the purchaser can both nominate its own price
for continuing to purchase old gas under the contracts specified by the purchaser and further request that the producer
nominate a price at which the producer would be willing to
continue selling any gas, old or new, covered under any contracts specified by the purchaser that cover at least some old
gas. If the parties cannot come to terms, the producer can
either continue sales at the old price under existing contracts
or abandon its existing obligations so long as it has executed a
new contract with another purchaser and given its old customer 30 days' notice. §§ 157.301, 270.201(c)(1), (e)(4). The
Commission's chief rationale for the GFN process was a fear
that automatic collection of the new price by producers would
lead to market disruption given the existence of numerous
gas contracts containing indefinite price-escalation clauses
tied to whatever ceiling the agency established. 51 Fed.
Reg., at 22204. The Commission further concluded that
NGA § 7(b), which establishes a "due hearing" requirement
before abandonments could take place, did not prevent it
from promulgating an across-the-board rule rather than engage in case-by-case adjudication. 15 U. S. C. § 717f(b).
Finally, the Commission rejected suggestions that it undertake completely to resolve the issue of take-or-pay provisions in certain natural gas contracts in the same proceeding
in which it addressed old gas pricing.' The Commission explained that it was already addressing the take-or-pay problem in its Order No. 436 proceedings. It further pointed out
that the GFN procedure, in allowing the purchaser to propose new higher prices for old gas in return for renegotiation
of take-or-pay obligations, would help resolve many take-orI A take-or-pay clause requires a purchasing pipeline to take a specified
volume of gas from a producer or, if it is unable to do so, to pay for the
specified volume. See Transco, 474 U. S. 409, 412 (1986).

pay disputes. The Commission also reasoned that the expansion of old gas reserves resulting from its orders would
reduce new gas prices and thus reduce the pipelines' overall
take-or-pay exposure. 51 Fed. Reg., at 22174-22175, 22183,
22196-22197, 46783-46784.
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the orders on the ground that the Commission
had exceeded its statutory authority. The court first concluded that Congress did not intend to give the Commission
the authority to set a single ceiling price for old gas under
§§ 104(b)(2) and 106(c). The court also dismissed the ceiling
price itself as unreasonable since it was higher than the spot
market price when the orders were issued and so amounted
to "de facto deregulation." 885 F. 2d, at 218-222. Second,
the court rejected the GFN procedure on the basis that the
Commission lacked the authority to provide for across-theboard, preauthorized abandonment under §7(b). Id., at
221-222. Third, the court chided the Commission for failing
to seize the opportunity to resolve the take-or-pay issue, although it did acknowledge that the Commission was addressing that matter on remand from the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in Associated Gas Distributorsv. FERC, 263
U. S. App. D. C. 1, 824 F. 2d 981 (1987), cert. denied, 485
U. S. 1006 (1988). The dissent disagreed with all three conclusions, observing that the majority should have deferred to
the Commission as the agency Congress delegated to regulate natural gas. 885 F. 2d, at 226-235 (Brown, J., dissenting). We granted certiorari, 496 U. S. 904 (1990), and now
reverse and sustain the Commission's orders.
II
Section 104 (a) provides that the maximum price for old gas
should be computed as provided in § 104(b). 4 The general
I Section 104 in its entirety reads:
"Ceiling price for sales of natural gas dedicated to interstate commerce.

interstate commerce on [November 8, 1978,] and for which a just and reasonable rate under the Natural Gas Act [15 U. S. C. § 717 et seq.] was in

rule under § 104(b)(1) is that each category of old gas would
be priced as it was prior to the enactment of the NGPA, but
increased over time in accordance with an inflation formula.
This was the regime that obtained under the NGPA until the
issuance of the orders at issue here. Section 104(b)(2), however, plainly gives the Commission authority to change this
regulatory scheme applicable to old gas:
"The Commission may, by rule or order, prescribe a
maximum lawful ceiling price, applicable to any first sale
effect on such date for the first sale of such natural gas, the maximum lawful price computed under subsection (b) shall apply to any first sale of such
natural gas delivered during any month.
"(b) Maximum lawful price. "(1) General rule. -The maximum lawful price under this section for any
month shall be the higher of"(A)(i) the just and reasonable rate, per million Btu's, established by the
Commission which was (or would have been) applicable to the first sale of
such natural gas on April 20, 1977, in the case of April 1977; and
"(ii) in the case of any month thereafter, the maximum lawful price, per
million Btu's, prescribed under this subparagraph for the preceding month
multiplied by the monthly equivalent of the annual inflation adjustment
factor applicable for such month, or
"(B) any just and reasonable rate which was established by the Commission after April 27, 1977, and before [November 9, 1978,] and which is applicable to such natural gas.
"(2) Ceiling prices may be increased if just and reasonable. -The Commission may, by rule or order, prescribe a maximum lawful ceiling price,
applicable to any first sale of any natural gas (or category thereof, as determined by the Commission) otherwise subject to thepreceding provisions of
this section, if such price is"(A) higher than the maximum lawful price which would otherwise be
applicable under such provisions; and
"(B) just and reasonable within the meaning of the Natural Gas Act [15
U. S. C. 717 et seq.]."
Section 106(c) deals in almost identical language with the ceiling prices for
sales under "rollover" contacts, which the NGPA defines as contracts entered into on or after November 8, 1978, for the first sale of natural gas
that was previously subject to a contract that expired at the end of a fixed
term specified in the contract itself. 15 U. S. C. § 3301(12). A reference
to § 104(b)(2) is here used to refer to both provisions.

MOBIL OIL EXPLORATION v. UNITED DISTRIBUTION

Opinion of the Court

of any natural gas (or category thereof, as determined by
the Commission) otherwise subject to the preceding provisions of this section, if such price is"(A) higher than the maximum lawful price which
would otherwise be applicable under such provisions;
and
"(B) just and reasonable within the meaning of the
Natural Gas Act [15 U. S. C. 717 et seq.]." 15 U. S. C.
§§ 3314(b)(2) and 3316(c).
Nothing in these provisions prevents the Commission from
either increasing the ceiling price for multiple old gas vintages or from setting the ceiling price applicable to each vintage at the same level. To the contrary, the statute states
that the Commission may increase the ceiling price for "any
natural gas (or category thereof, as determined by the Commission)." (Emphasis added.) Likewise, § 104(b)(2) allows
the Commission to "prescribe a ceiling price" applicable to
any natural gas category. Insofar as "any" encompasses
"all," this language enables the Commission to set a single
ceiling price for every category of old gas. As we have
stated in similar contexts, "[i]f the statute is clear and unambiguous, 'that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well
as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."' Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S.
478, 482 (1990) (quoting K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486
U. S.281, 291 (1988)).
Respondents counter that the structure of the NGPA
points to the opposite conclusion. Specifically, they contend
that Congress could not have intended to allow the Commission to collapse all old gas vintages under a single price where
the NGPA created detailed incentives for new and hardto-produce gas on one hand, yet carefully preserved the old
gas vintaging scheme on the other. Brief for Respondents
33-37. We disagree. The statute's bifurcated approach implies no more than that Congress found the need to encourage new gas production sufficiently pressing to deal with the

matter directly, but was content to leave old gas pricing
within the discretion of the Commission to alter as conditions
warranted. The plain meaning of § 104(b)(2) confirms this
view.
Further, the Commission's decision to set a single ceiling
fully accords with the two restrictions that the NGPA does
establish. With respect to the first, the requirement that a
ceiling price be "higher than" the old vintage ceilings carried
over from the NGA does nothing to prevent the Commission
from consolidating existing categories and setting one price
equivalent to the highest previous ceiling.
15 U. S. C.
§§ 3314(b)(2)(A) and 3316(c)(1). With respect to the second,
collapsing the old vintages also comports with the mandate
that price ceilings be "just and reasonable within the meaning
of the Natural Gas Act." 15 U. S. C. §§3314(b)(2)(B) and
3316(c)(2).
Far from binding the Commission, the "just and reasonable" requirement accords it broad ratemaking authority that
its decision to set a single ceiling does not exceed. The
Court has repeatedly held that the just and reasonable standard does not compel the Commission to use any single pricing
formula in general or vintaging in particular. FPC v. Hope
Natural Gas Co., 320 U. S. 591, 602 (1944); FPC v. Natural
Gas Pipeline Co., 315 U. S. 575, 586 (1942); Permian Basin,
390 U. S., at 776-777; FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S. 380,
386-389 (1974); Mobil Oil Corp. v. FPC, 417 U. S. 283, 308
(1974). Courts of Appeals have also consistently affirmed
the Commission's use of a replacement-cost-based method
under the NGA. E. g., Shell Oil Co. v. FPC, 520 F. 2d
1061, 1082-1083 (CA5 1975), cert. denied, 426 U. S. 941
(1976); American Public Gas Assn. v. FPC, 567 F. 2d 1016,
1059 (CADC 1977), cert. denied, 435 U. S. 907 (1978). By
incorporating the "just and reasonable" standard into the
NGPA, Congress clearly meant to preserve the pricing flexibility the Commission had historically exercised under the

Opinion of the Court

NGA. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v.
Curran, 456 U. S. 353, 378-382 (1982). In employing a replacement cost formula, the Commission did no more than
what it had previously done under the NGA: collapse vintage
categories together because the replacement cost for natural
gas is the same regardless of when it was placed in production. See Order No. 749, Just and Reasonable National
5
Rates for Sales of Natural Gas, 54 F. P. C. 3090 (1975).
Respondents contend that even if the statute allows the
Commission to set a single old gas ceiling, the particular ceiling it has set is unjustly and impermissibly high. They first
argue that the Commission conceded that actual collection of
the new price would not be just and therefore established the
GFN procedures as a requisite safeguard. The Commission
correctly denies having made any such concession. In its orders, in its briefs, and at oral argument, the agency has been
at pains to point out that its ceiling price, which was no
higher than the highest of the ceilings then applicable to
old gas, falls squarely within the "zone of reasonableness"
mandated by the NGA. See Permian Basin, supra, at 767.
What the agency has acknowledged is that automatic collection of prices up to the ceiling under the escalator clauses
common to industry contracts would produce "inappropriate"
market distortion, especially since the market price remains
below the ceiling. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 89-1453,
p. 12. In consequence the Commission instituted the GFN
process to mitigate too abrupt a transition from one pricing
regime to the next. Respondents have not sought to challenge (and we do not today consider) the Commission's au5

Even had we concluded that §§ 104(b)(2) and 106(c) failed to speak unambiguously to the ceiling price question, we would nonetheless be compelled to defer to the Commission's interpretation. It follows from our
foregoing discussion that the agency's view cannot be deemed arbitrary,
capricious, or manifestly contrary to the NGPA. See Chevron U. S. A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 843-844
(1984); K mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 486 U. S. 281, 292 (1988).

thority to require this process, but they assert that the
requiring of it amounts to an acknowledgment by the Commission that the new ceiling price is in fact unreasonable.
We disagree. There is nothing incompatible between the belief that a price is reasonable and the belief that it ought not
to be imposed without prior negotiations. We decline to disallow an otherwise lawful rate because additional safeguards
accompany it.
We likewise reject respondents' more fundamental objection that no order "deregulating" the price of old gas can be
deemed just and reasonable. The agency's orders do not deregulate in any legally relevant sense. The Commission
adopted an approved pricing formula, set a maximum price,
and expressly rejected proposals that it truly deregulate by
eliminating any ceiling for old gas whatsoever.
App.
170-171. Nor can we conclude that deregulation results simply because a given ceiling price may be above the market
price. United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Serv. Corp.,
350 U. S. 332, 343 (1956); FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co.,
350 U. S. 348, 353 (1956); FPC v. Texaco Inc., 417 U. S.
380, 397 (1974).
III
We further hold that Order No. 451's abandonment procedures fully comport with the requirements set forth in § 7(b)
of the NGA. 15 U. S. C. § 717f(b). In particular, we reject
the suggestion that this provision mandates individualized
proceedings involving interested parties before a specific
abandonment can take place.
Section 7(b), which Congress retained when enacting the
NGPA, states:
"No natural-gas company shall abandon all or any portion of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the
Commission, or any service rendered by means of such
facilities, without the permission and approval of the
Commission first had and obtained, after due hearing,
and a finding by the Commission that the available sup-

Opinion of the Court

ply of natural gas is depleted to the extent that the continuance of service is unwarranted, or that the present
or future public convenience or necessity permit such
abandonment." 15 U. S. C. § 717f(b).
As applied to this case § 7(b) prohibits a producer from abandoning its contractual service obligations to the purchaser unless the Commission has, first, granted its "permission and
approval" of the abandonment; second, made a "finding" that
"present or future public convenience or necessity permit
such abandonment"; and, third, held a "hearing" that is
"due." The Commission has taken each of these steps.
First, Order No. 451 permits and approves the abandonment at issue. That approval is not specific to any single
abandonment but is instead general, prospective, and conditional. These conditions include: failure by the purchaser
and producer to agree to a revised price under the GFN procedures; execution of a new contract between the producer
and a new purchaser; and 30-days' notice to the previous
purchaser of contract termination. 18 CFR §270.201(c)(1)
(1986). Neither respondents nor the Court of Appeals holding directly questions the Commission's orders for failing to
satisfy this initial requirement. As we have previously held,
nothing in § 7(b) prevents the Commission from giving advance approval of abandonment. FPC v. Moss, 424 U. S.
494, 499-502 (1976). See PermianBasin, 390 U. S., at 776.
Second, the Commission also made the necessary findings
that "present or future public interest or necessity" allowed
the conditional abandonment that it prescribed. 51 Fed.
Reg., at 46785-46787. Reviewing "all relevant factors involved in determining the overall public interest," the Commission found that preauthorized abandonment under the
GFN regime would generally protect purchasers by allowing
them to buy at market rates elsewhere if contracting producers insisted on the new ceiling price; safeguard producers by
allowing them to abandon service if the contracting purchaser
fails to come to terms; and serve the market by releasing pre-

viously unused reserves of old gas. See Felmont Oil Corp.

(1985), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. ConsolidatedEdison
Co. of N. Y. v. FERC, 262 U. S. App. D. C. 222, 823 F. 2d
630 (1987). At bottom these findings demonstrate the agency's determination that the GFN conditions make certain
matters common to all abandonments. Contrary to respondents' theory, § 7(b) does not compel the agency to make "specific findings" with regard to every abandonment when the
issues involved are general. As we held in the context of
disability proceedings under the Social Security Act, "general factual issue[s] may be resolved as fairly through
rulemaking" as by considering specific evidence when the
questions under consideration are "not unique" to the particular case.
Heckler v. Campbell, 461 U. S. 458, 468
(1983).
Finally, it follows from the foregoing that the Commission
discharged its §7(b) duty to hold a "due hearing." Before
promulgating Order No. 451, the agency held both a notice
and comment hearing and an oral hearing. As it correctly
concluded, § 7(b) required no more. Time and again, "[t]he
Court has recognized that even where an agency's enabling
statute expressly requires it to hold a hearing, the agency
may rely on its rulemaking authority to determine issues that
do not require case-by-case consideration."
Heckler v.
Campbell, supra, at 467; PermianBasin, supra, at 774-777;
FPC v. Texaco Inc., 377 U. S. 33, 41-44 (1964); United
States v. Storer BroadcastingCo., 351 U. S. 192, 205 (1956).
The Commission's approval conditions establish, and its findings confirm, that the abandonment at issue here is precisely
the type of issue in which "[a] contrary holding would require
the agency continually to relitigate issues that may be established fairly and efficiently in a single rulemaking proceeding." Heckler v. Campbell, supra, at 467. See Panhandle
Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. FERC, 285 U. S. App. D. C. 115,

(1987), cert. denied, 485 U. S. 1006 (1988).
Neither the Court of Appeals nor respondents have uncovered a convincing rationale for holding otherwise. Relying
on United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. McCombs, 442 U. S. 529
(1979), the panel majority held that Order No. 451's prospective approval of abandonment was impermissible given the
"practical" control the GFN process afforded producers. 885
F. 2d, at 221-223. McCombs, however, is inapposite since
that case dealt with a producer who attempted to abandon
with no Commission approval, finding, or hearing whatsoever. Nor can respondents object that the Commission
made no provision for individual determinations under its
abandonment procedures where appropriate. Under Order
No. 451, a purchaser who objects to a given abandonment on
the grounds that the conditions the agency has set forth have
not been met may file a complaint with the Commission. See
18 CFR § 385.206 (1986).
IV
We turn, finally, to the problem of "take-or-pay" contracts.
A take-or-pay contract obligates a pipeline to purchase a
specified volume of gas at a specified price and, if it is unable
to do so, to pay for that volume. A plausible response to the
gas shortages of the 1970's, this device has created significant
dislocations in light of the oversupply of gas that has occurred
since. Today many purchasers face disastrous take-or-pay
liability without sufficient outlets to recoup their losses.
The Court of Appeals cited this problem as a further reason
for invalidating Order No. 451. Specifically, the court chastised the Commission for its "regrettable and unwarranted"
failure to address the take-or-pay problem in the rulemaking
under consideration. 885 F. 2d, at 224.
Exactly what the court held, however, is another matter.
The dissent viewed the majority's discussion as affirmatively

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Opinion of the Court

498 U. S.

ordering the Commission "once and for all to solve" the entire
take-or-pay issue. 885 F. 2d, at 234 (Brown, J., dissenting).
Respondents more narrowly characterize the holding as that
the Commission should have addressed the take-or-pay problem at least to the extent that Order No. 451 exacerbated it.
Brief for Respondents 67-70. We have no need to choose between these interpretations because the Court of Appeals
erred under either view.
The court clearly overshot the mark if it ordered the
Commission to resolve the take-or-pay problem in this proceeding. An agency enjoys broad discretion in determining
how best to handle related, yet discrete, issues in terms of
procedures, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519 (1978),
and priorities, Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831-832
(1985). We have expressly approved an earlier Commission
decision to treat the take-or-pay issue separately where a different proceeding would generate more appropriate information and where the agency was addressing the question.
FPC v. Sunray DX Oil Co., 391 U. S. 9, 49-51 (1968). The
record in this case shows that approximately two-thirds of
existing take-or-pay contracts do not involve old gas. We
are satisfied that the agency could compile relevant data
more effectively in a separate proceeding. We are likewise
satisfied that "the Commission itself has taken steps to alleviate take-or-pay problems." Id., at 50. In promulgating
Order No. 451, the agency explained that it had chosen not to
deal with the take-or-pay matter directly primarily because it
was addressing the matter on remand from the D. C. Circuit.
Associated Gas Distributorsv. FERC, supra.6
The Court of Appeals for the D. C. Circuit has since invalidated the
Commission's principal attempt at solving the problem.

Opinion of the Court

The court likewise erred if it meant that the Commission
should have addressed the take-or-pay problem insofar as
Order No. 451 "exacerbated" it. This rationale does not provide a basis for invalidating the Commission's orders. As
noted, an agency need not solve every problem before it in
the same proceeding. This applies even where the initial solution to one problem has adverse consequences for another
area that the agency was addressing. See Vermont Yankee,
supra, at 543-544 (agencies are free to engage in multiple
rulemaking "[a]bsent constitutional constraints or extremely
compelling circumstances"). Moreover, the agency articulated rational grounds for concluding that Order No. 451
would do more to ameliorate the take-or-pay problem than
worsen it. 51 Fed. Reg., at 22196, 46783-46784. The
agency reasoned that the GFN procedures would encourage
the renegotiation of take-or-pay provisions in contracts involving the sale of old gas or old gas and new gas together.
Id., at 22196-22197. The agency further noted that the
release of old gas would reduce the market price for new gas
and thus reduce the pipelines' aggregate liability. We are
neither inclined nor prepared to second-guess the agency's
reasoned determination in this complex area. See Motor
Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm
Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 43 (1983).
V
We disagree with the Court of Appeals that the Commission lacked the authority to set a single ceiling price for old
gas; possessed no power to authorize conditional preauthorized abandonment of producers' obligations to provide old
gas; or had a duty to address the take-or-pay problem more
fully in this proceeding. Accordingly, we reverse the judgNo. 90-806. Nothing in our holding today precludes interested parties
from petitioning the Commission for further rulemaking should it become
apparent that the agency is no longer addressing the take-or-pay problem.
