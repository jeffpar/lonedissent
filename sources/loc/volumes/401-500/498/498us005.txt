TEMPLE v. SYNTHES CORP.
Per Curiam

TEMPLE v. SYNTHES CORP., LTD.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-295.

Decided November 5, 1990

After petitioner Temple, a Mississippi resident, was implanted with a
device manufactured by respondent Synthes Corp., Ltd., during surgery
in a Louisiana hospital, the device's screws broke off inside his back.
He filed a diversity action against Synthes in the Federal District Court
for the Eastern District of Louisiana and a suit in Louisiana state
court against the hospital and the doctor who performed the surgery.
Synthes filed a motion to dismiss Temple's federal claim for failure to join
necessary parties pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. The
court ordered Temple to join the doctor and the hospital within 20 days
or risk dismissal, reasoning that joinder was required in the interest of
judicial economy. When Temple failed to join the others, the court dismissed the suit with prejudice. The Court of Appeals affirmed.
Held: The doctor and the hospital are potential joint tortfeasors and, therefore, are not indispensable parties under Rule 19(b). It is not necessary
for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit. See, e. g., Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., 349 U. S.
322, 329-330. Nothing in the 1966 revision of Rule 19 changed that principle, see Provident Tradesrnens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390
U. S. 102, 116-117, n. 12, and there is nothing in Louisiana tort law to
the contrary. The doctor and the hospital were merely permissive parties, who do not meet the threshold requirements of Rule 19(a). To the
extent that Provident Bank speaks of the public interest in limiting multiple litigation, it is not controlling here, because it addressed the issue
whether a party who met Rule 19(a)'s requirements was, in fact, indispensable under Rule 19(b).
Certiorari granted; 898 F. 2d 152, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Petitioner Temple, a Mississippi resident, underwent surgery in October 1986 in which a "plate and screw device" was
implanted in his lower spine. * The device was manufactured
by respondent Synthes Corp., Ltd. (U. S. A.) (Synthes), a
Pennsylvania corporation. Dr. S. Henry LaRocca performed
the surgery at St. Charles General Hospital in New Orleans,

498 U. S.

Louisiana. Following surgery, the device's screws broke off
inside Temple's back.
Temple filed suit against Synthes in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The suit,
which rested on diversity jurisdiction, alleged defective
design and manufacture of the device. At the same time,
Temple filed a state administrative proceeding against Dr.
LaRocca and the hospital for malpractice and negligence.
At the conclusion of the administrative proceeding, Temple
filed suit against the doctor and the hospital in Louisiana
state court.
Synthes did not attempt to bring the doctor and the hospital into the federal action by means of a third-party complaint, as provided in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 14(a).
Instead, Synthes filed a motion to dismiss Temple's federal
suit for failure to join necessary parties pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 19. Following a hearing, the District Court ordered Temple to join the doctor and the hospital
as defendants within 20 days or risk dismissal of the lawsuit.
According to the court, the most significant reason for requiring joinder was the interest of judicial economy. App.
to Pet. for Cert. A-12. The court relied on this Court's decision in Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U. S. 102 (1968), wherein we recognized that one
focus of Rule 19 is "the interest of the courts and the public in
complete, consistent, and efficient settlement of controversies." Id., at 111. When Temple failed to join the doctor
and the hospital, the court dismissed the suit with prejudice.
Temple appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 898 F. 2d 152 (1990) (judgt.
order). The court deemed it "obviously prejudicial to the defendants to have the separate litigations being carried on,"
because Synthes' defense might be that the plate was not defective but that the doctor and the hospital were negligent,
while the doctor and the hospital, on the other hand, might
claim that they were not negligent but that the plate was de-

fective. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-3. The Court of Appeals
found that the claims overlapped and that the District Court
therefore had not abused its discretion in ordering joinder
under Rule 19. A petition for rehearing was denied.
In his petition for certiorari to this Court, Temple contends
that it was error to label joint tortfeasors as indispensable
parties under Rule 19(b) and to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice for failure to join those parties. We agree. Synthes
does not deny that it, the doctor, and the hospital are potential joint tortfeasors. It has long been the rule that it is not
necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants
in a single lawsuit. See Lawlor v. National Screen Service
Corp., 349 U. S. 322, 329-330 (1955); Bigelow v. Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co., 225 U. S. 111, 132
(1912). See also Nottingham v. General American Communications Corp., 811 F. 2d 873, 880 (CA5) (per curiam), cert.
denied, 484 U. S. 854 (1987). Nothing in the 1966 revision
of Rule 19 changed that principle. See Provident Bank,
supra, at 116-117, n. 12. The Advisory Committee Notes to
Rule 19(a) explicitly state that "a tortfeasor with the usual
'joint-and-several' liability is merely a permissive party to an
action against another with like liability." 28 U. S. C. App.,
p. 595. There is nothing in Louisiana tort law to the contrary. See Mullin v. Skains, 252 La. 1009, 1014, 215 So. 2d
643, 645 (1968); La. Civ. Code Ann., Arts. 1794, 1795 (West
1987).
The opinion in Provident Bank, supra, does speak of the
public interest in limiting multiple litigation, but that case is
not controlling here. There, the estate of a tort victim
brought a declaratory judgment action against an insurance
company. We assumed that the policyholder was a person
"who, under ยง (a), should be 'joined if feasible."' 390 U. S.,
at 108, and went on to discuss the appropriate analysis under
Rule 19(b), because the policyholder could not be joined without destroying diversity. Id., at 109-116. After examining
the factors set forth in Rule 19(b), we determined that the

8

OCTOBER TERM, 1990
Per Curiam

498 U. S.

action could proceed without the policyholder; he therefore
was not an indispensable party whose absence required dismissal of the suit. Id., at 116, 119.
Here, no inquiry under Rule 19(b) is necessary, because
the threshold requirements of Rule 19(a) have not been satisfied. As potential joint tortfeasors with Synthes, Dr. LaRocca and the hospital were merely permissive parties. The
Court of Appeals erred by failing to hold that the District
Court abused its discretion in ordering them joined as defendants and in dismissing the action when Temple failed to
comply with the court's order. For these reasons, we grant
the petition for certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
