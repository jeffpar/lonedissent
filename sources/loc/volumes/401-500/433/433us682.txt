433 TT. S.

HARRIS v. OKLAHOMA
ON PETITION FOR W1IT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF
CRIMINAL APPEALS OF OKLAHOMA

No. 76-5663.

Decided June 29, 1977

Where petitioner had been convicted of felony-murder based on his
companion's killing of a victim during the course of an armed robbery,
the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment barred a separate
prosecution of petitioner for the lesser crime of robbery with firearms,
since conviction of the greater crime of murder could not be had without conviction of the lesser crime.
Certiorari granted; 555 P. 2d 76, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

A clerk in a Tulsa, Okla., grocery store was shot and killed
by a companion of petitioner in the course of a robbery of
the store by the two men. Petitioner was convicted of felonymurder in Oklahoma State court. The opinion of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in this case states that "[i] n
a felony murder case, the proof of the underlying felony
[here robbery with firearms] is needed to prove the intent
necessary for a felony murder conviction." 555 P. 2d 76, 80-81
(1976). Petitioner nevertheless was thereafter brought to
trial and convicted on a separate information charging the
robbery with firearms, after denial of his motion to dismiss on
the ground that this prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy
Clause of the Fifth Amendment because he had been already
convicted of the offense in the felony-murder trial. The
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.
When, as here, conviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot
be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with
firearms, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for
the lesser crime after conviction of the greater one.* In re

Reversed.
MR. JUSTIcE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JusTIcE MARSHALL
joins, concurring.
I join the Court's opinion but in any event would reverse
on a ground not addressed by the Court, namely, that the
State did not prosecute the two informations in one proceeding. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause
of the Fifth Amendment, applied to the States through the
Fourteenth Amendment, requires the prosecution in one proceeding, except in extremely limited circumstances not present
here, of "all the charges against a defendant that grow out
of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction."

concurring). See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 429 U. S. 1053
