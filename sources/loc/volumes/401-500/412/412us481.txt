GERTIORARI TO THZ COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, FIRST
PPELIAT]- DISTRICT

No. 71-1182.

Argued March 27-28, 1973--Decided June 11, 1973

P~titioner, a Yurok, or Klamat]i River, Indian, intervened in a forfeiture, proceeding, seeking the return of five gill nets confiscated
by a California game warden. He alleged that the nets were
seized in Indian country, within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. § 1151,
-and that the state: statutes prohibiting their se did not apply
to him. The state trial court found that the Klamath River Reservation in 1892 "for 41 practical purpoges almost immediately
lost its identity," and concluded that the area was not Indian
country. The State Court of Appeal affirmed, holding tJat since
the area had been 'opened for unrestricted homestead entry in
1892, the earlier reservation status of the land had terminated.
Indian country is defined by § 1151 as including "all land within
the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the
United States Government, notwithstanding the issuance of any
patent." The Klamath River Reservation was established by
Executie Order in 1855 and included the area in question. In
1891, by Executive Order, -the Klamath River Reservation was
made part of the Hoopa Valley Reservation. The Act of June 17,
1892, provided that "all of the lands embraced in what was
Klamath River Reservation" reserved under the 1855 Executive
Order, are "declared to be subject to settlement, entry, and purchase under the laws of the United States granting homestead
rghts . . . Provided, That any Indian now located upon said
reservation may, at any time within one year . .. apply to the
Secretary of the Interior for an allotment of land ....
And
the Secretary of the Interior may reserve from settlement, entry,
or purchase any tract.. . .upon which any village'or settlement
of Indians is now located, and may set Apart, the same for the
permanent use and occupation of said village or settlement of
Indians." The Aet urther provided that proceeds from the sale
of the lands "shall constitute a fund . .. for the maintenance
and education of the Indians now residing on said lands and
their children." Held: The Klamath River Reservation was not

terminated by the Act of June 17, 1892, and the land within the
reservation boundaries is still Indian country, within theoneaning
of 18 U. S. C. § 1151. Pp. 494-506.
(a) The allotment provisions of the 1892 Act, rather than indicating an intention to terminate the reservation, are com'pletely consistent with continued reservation status. Seymour v.
Superintendent, 368 U. S. 351. Pp. 496-497.
(b) The reference in the Act to the Klamath River Reservationin the past tense did not manifest a congressional purpose to
terminate the reservation, but was merely a convenient way of
identifying the land, which had just recently been included in
the Hoopa Valley Reservation. Pp. 498-499.
(c) The Act's legislative hitory does not support the view that
the reservation was terminated,- but by contrast with the final
enactment, it compels the conclusion that efforts to terminate
by denying allotments to the Indians failed completely. Pp.499-504.
(d) A congressional determination to termimnte a reservation
must be expressed on the face of the statute or be clear from the
surrounding circumstances'and legislative history, neither of which
obtained here. Pp. 504-505.
(e) The conclusion that the 1892 Act did not termninate the
Reservation is reinforced by repeated recognition thereafter by
the Department of the Interior and by the Congress. Congress
has recognized the reservation's continued existence by extending,
in 1942, the period of trust allotments, and in 1958, by restoring
to trib-i ownership certain Vacant aid undisposed-of ceded lands
in the reservation. P. 505.

MR. JusmCE Bricxm N delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Our decision in this case turns -on the resolution of
the narrow question whether the Klainath River Indian Reservation in northern California was terminated
by Act of Congress or whether it-remains "Indian country," within the meaning of 18 U. S, C. § 1151.2 When
established, the reservation was described as "a strip of
territory commencing at the Pacific Ocean and. extending 1 mile in width on each side of the Klamath *River"
'Title 18 U. S. C. § 1151 defines the term "Indian country to include, inter alia,,"all lafids within the limits of any Indian reservation
under the jurisdiction -of the United States Government, notwithstanding th6 issuance of any patent : .'.."
Title 18 U. S. C. § 1162 (a) provides that, with respect to Indian
country within California, that State "shall have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country ... to the same extent that such State ) . . has jurisdiction over
offenses committed elsewherewithin the State..., and the criminal
laws of such State . .. shall have the same force and effect within
such Indian country as they have elsewhere within the' State. ...
Section 1162 (b) provides, however, "Nothing in this section ...
shall deprive any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community
of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty,
agreement, or statute with rese6ct to hunting, trapping, or fishing
or -the control, licensing, or regulation thereof."
Finally, the California Fish & Game Code § 12300 (Supp. 1973),
reads:
"Irrespective of any other-piovision of la*, the provisions of this
code are not applicable to California Indians whose nanies are inscribed upon. the tribal rolls, while on the reservation of such tribe
and under those circumstances in this State where the code was not
applicable to them immediately prior to the effective date of Public,
Law 280, Chapter 505, First Session, 1953, 83d Congress of the

for a distance of approximately 20 miles, encompassing
an area not exceeding 25,000 acres. This description is
taken from President Franklin Pierce's Executive Order
issued November 16, 1855, pursuant to' the authority
granted by the Act of March 3, 1853, 10 Statr 226, 238,
and the Act of March 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 686, 699.2
Petitioner Riymond Mattz is a Yurok, or Klamath
River, Indian who, since the age of nine, regularly
fished, as his graindfather did beforehim, with dip, gill,
and trigger nets, at a location called Brooks Riffle on
the Klamath River. On Septei4er 24, 1969, a California game warden confiscated fi~e.gill nets owned by
Mattz. The nets were stored near Brooks Riffle, approximately 200 feet from" the river, and within 20 miles
of the river's mouth,
The respondent Director'of the tepartment of Fish
and Game instituted a foffeiture--proceeding in state
court. JMattz intervined and aked for the return of his
nets. He alleged, among other things, -that he was an
enrolled member of the Yurok Tribe, that the nets were
seized within Indian country, and that the state statutes
prohibiting 4he use of gill nets, Cal. Fish & Game Code
§§8664, 8686, and 8630, therefore were inapplicable 'to
him.. The state trial court, ielying on Elser v. Gill Net

nets were seized wai not Indian country. The court
thereby disposed of petitioner's primary defense to the
forfeiture. It did not reach other issues bearing upon
the application of the California statutes to Indian country and the existence of Indian fishing rights there.
On appeal, the State Court of Appeal affirmed, holding
that, inasmuch as the, area in question had been opefied
for unrestricted homestead entry in 1892, the earlier reaervation status of the land had terminated. -20 CaL App.
3d 729, 97 Cal. Rptr. 894 (1971). The Supreme- Court
'of California, one judge dissenting, denied a petition for
hearing. oSee 20 Cal. App. 3d, At 735, 97 Cal. Rptr., at"
898. We g'ranted certiorari, 409 U. S. 1124 (1973), because .the judgments of the state courts appeared to be
in conflict with-applicable decisions of this Court.
We now reverse. Th6 reversal, of course, does not
dispose of the underlyifig forfeiture issue. On remand,
the questions relating tothe existence of Mattz' fishing
rights and to the applicability of California law not-withstanding reservation status will be addressed. We
intimate no opinion on those iisues.

I
While the current reservation status of the Klamath
River Reservation turns primarily upon the effect of an
1892 Act of Congress which opened the 'reservation land
for settlement, the meaning'and effect of that Act cannot be determined without some reference to 'the Yurok
Tribe and the history "of the reservation between 1855
and 1892.
The Yurok Indians apparently resided in the area of
the lower Klamath R~iver for a substantial period before
1855 when the Klamath River Reservation was established. Little is known of their prior history. There
are sources, however, that provide us with relatively

detailed information about the tribe, its culture, living

-

conditions, and customs for the period following, 1855.
That the, tribe had inhabited the lower Klamath River
well before 1855 is suggested by the name. Yurok means
"down the river." The names of the neighboring tribes,
the Karok and the Modok, mean, respectively, "'up the
river" and "head bf. the river," and these appellations,

as would be expected, coincide with the respective homelands. Powers 19; Kroeber, 15. 5

Opinion of the Court

By the Act of March 3, 1853, 10 Stat. 28, the
President was "authorized to make five military reservations from the public domain in the State of California or the, Territories of Utah and New Mexico bordering- on said State, for Indian purposes." The Act of
March 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 699, appropriated funds for
"collecting, removing, and subsisting the Indians of California . . . on two additional military reservations, to
be selected as heretofore... Provided, That the Pres'ident miy enlarge the quantity of reservations heretofore selected, equal to those hereby provided for."
President .Pierce then issued his 'order of 'November 16,
1855, specifying the Klamath River Reservation and
stating, "Let the reservation be made, as proposed."
Kappler 817.
The site was ideally selected for the Yuroke. They
had lived in tht area; the'arable land, although limited,
was "peculiarly' adapted to the growth of vegetables,"

canyon its entire length, aboundca in salmon and other
.fish. Ibid.; 1858 Report 286.
In 1861 nearly all the arable lands on the Klamath
River Reservation were destroyed by a freshet, and, upon
recbmmendation of. the local Indian agent, some of the
Indians were removed to the Smith River Reservation,
established for that purpose in 1862. Only a small num-ber of Yuroks moved to the new reservation, however,and nearly all those who did move returned within a few

adapted to these Indians, aid to which they themselves are so well

be better spared to ihem. No territory offers more-.to these Indians and very little territory offers less to the white man. The

The total Yurok population on the Klamath River
Reservation in the 1860's cannot be stated with precision. In 1852: based in part on a rough census made by
a trader, it was estimated at 2,500. Kroeber 16-17.7
7 It is interesting to note that Powers believed the Yurok population at one -time far exceeded 2,500 and perhaps numbered over

5,000. This was, as Powers stated, , "before the whites had come

The effect of the 1861, flood cannot be -flrmly.established;
but it is clear that the tribe remained on he Klamath
thereafter.'* Forlater years, Xroeber estimated that the
population in 1895 was 90p, and, in 1910, 668. Kroeber
19. From this it would appear that the flood at least
did not caus6 a dissolution of the tribe; on th6 cetrary, the Yuroks continued to reside in the area through
the turn of the century and beyond..
The Act of April 8, 1864, 13 Stat. 39, designated California as one Indian superintendency. It also recited
that "there shall be set apart hy the President, and at
his discretion, not exceeding four tracts of land, within
the limits of said state, to be retained by the United
States for the purposes of Indian reservations." It further provided that "the several Indian reservations in
California which shall not be retained . ; . under....
this act, shall . . .be surveyed into lots or parcels ...
and... be offered for sale at public outcry, and thence
afterward shall be held "subject to sale at private entry."
Id., at 40.
At the time of the passage of the 1864 Act there were,
-apparently, three reservations in California: the Klamath River, the Mendocino, and the Smith River. 'It
appears, also, that the President did not take immediate

formal recognition occurred, and then it was the Congress, rather than the President, that acted: In that
year Congress discontinued the Smith River Reservation, 15 Stat. 221, and restored the Mendocino to the
public lands. Id., at 223. No'similar action was'taken
with respect to the Klamath River Reservation. Crich,

"and for it and the Hoopa Valley Reservation in 1869,

been established theretofore by formal Executive Order.'
The Klamath River Reservation, although not reestablished by Executive Order or specific congressional
,action, cqntinued, certainly, in de facto existence.
Yuroks remained on reservation land,. and the Department of Indian Affairs regarded the Klamath River
Reservation as "in a state of reservation" throughout
the period from 1864 to 1891.10 No steps were taken
to sell the reservation, or parts thereof, under the 1864
Act. Indeed,-'in 1879, all trespassers there were removed,

the four reservations to be retained under said act, either to extend
the Hoopa Valley Reservation (one of the reservations selected under
the act), so as to include the Kiamath River Reservation, or else
keep it as a separate independent reservation, with a station or

Indians now, and is regarded and treated as such reservation by

.In 1888, in a forfeiture suit, th6 United States District
Court for the Northern District of California concluded
that the area within the Klamath River Reservation was
not Indian country, within the meaning of Rev. Stat.
§:2133, prescribing the penalty for -unlicensed trading in
Indian country. The court.concluded that the land composing the reservation was not retained or recognized
as feservation land pursuant to the 1864 Act and that,
therefore, it no longer constituted an Indian reservation.

35 F. 403 (lND Cal. 1888). This holding was expressly
affirmed on appeal to a circuit judge. 38 F. 400 (CCND

the judgment but was not convinced that his own views
were erroneous, and he could not assenfto the reasoning
of the court. He felt that the court's comments as to
the abandoned status of the reservation "were dicta and
not essential to the decision of the caseobefore the court."
Crichton v. Shelton, 33 I. D., at 215.
I Thus, as of 1891,-it may be fair to say -that the exact
legal status of the Klamath River Reservation was obscure and uncertain. The petitioner in his brief here;
it was regularly set apar as such by tho constituted authorities,
and dedicated to that purpose with all the solemnities known to
the law, thus adding official sanction to a right of occupation already
in existence. It seems to me something more than a mere iAplication, arising from a rigid and technical construction of an act
of Congress, is required to show that it was the intention of that"
body to deprive these Indians of their right of 'occupancy of said'
lands, without consultation with them or their assent. Ad an implication to that effect is all, I think that can be made out of that
portion of the third section of the act of 1864 which is supposed
to be applicable.", Quoted in Crichton v. Shelton, 33 I. D., at

Opinion of the Court

p. 14, states that the reservation "ceased to exist in 1876,
at the latest."
Any question concerning the reservation's continuing
,legal existence, however, appears to have been effectively
laid to rest by an Executive Order dated October 16,
1891, issued by President Benjanin Harrison. 4 By the
specific terms of that order, the *Hoopa Valley Reser"Vation,which, as we alredy-have noted, was located in
1864 and formally set apart in 1876, and which was
situated about 50 miles upstream from the Klamath
River's mouth, was extended so as to include all land,
one mile in width on each. side of the river, from "the
present limits" of the Hoopa Valley Reservation to the
Pacific Ocean. The Kiamath River Reservation, or what
had been the reservation, thus was made part of the
Hoopa Valley Reservation, as extended.
The reason fo incorporating the Klamath River Reseryation in the Hoopa Valley Reservation is apparent.
The 1864 Act had authorized the President to "set apart"
no more than four tracts for Indian reservations in California. By 1876, and certainly by 1891, four reservations already' had been so set apart. These were the
Round Valley, referred to above, th Mission,"5 the Hoopa

a tract of country one mile in width on each side of the Klamath

Valley, and the Tule River. Kappler 830-831. Thus,
recognition of a fifth reservation along the Klamath
River was not permissible under the 1864 Act. Accordingly, the President turned to his authority under the
Act to expand an existing, recognized reservation. He
enlarged the Hoopa Valley Reservation to include what
had been the Klamath River Reservation as well as an
intervening riparian strip connecting the two tracts."0
The President's continuing authority so to enlarge reservations and, specifically, the legality of the 1891 Executive Order, was affirmed by this Court in D'nnelly

This general background as to the origin and development of the Klamath River Reservation is not contested
by either party. The reservation's existence, pursuant to
the Executive Order of 1891, is conceded. The present
controversy relates to its termination subsequent to 1891,
and turns primarily upon the effect of the Act of June 17,

1892, 27 Stat. 52, entitled "An act to provide for the
and even thereafter. These actiQns were taken under the President's continuing authority to set apart and add to or diminish
the four reservations authorized under the 1864 Act. Donnelly v.
United Staes, 228 U. S. 243 and '708 (1913). In its final form, the
Mission Reservation consisted of no less than 19 different and
noncontiguous tracts. Kappler 819-824; Crichton v. Shelton, 33

Valley Reservation and the Klamath River Reservation is referred'
to there as the "Connecting Strip." Under the 1891 Executive Order

•"That all of the lands -embraced in what was
Klamath, River Reservation in the State of California, as set apart and reserved under authority of
law. by an Executive order dated November sixteenzh, eighteen hundred and fifty-five, are hereby
declared to be subject to settlement, entry, and purchase, under the laws of the United States granting
homestead rights and authorizing the sale of mineral, stone, and timber lands: Provided, That any
Indian now located .upon said. reservation may, 'at
any time within &ne year from the passage of this
act, apply to the Secretary of the Interior for an allotment .... And the Secretary of the Interior
may reserve from settlement, entry, or purchase any
tract or tracts bf land upon which any vllage or
settlement of Indians is now located, and ray set

Provided further, That the proceeds arising from
the sale of said lands shall constitute a fund to be
used under the direction of the Secretary of the
Interior for the maintenance and education of the
Indians now residing on said lands and their
children."
Th6 respondent Director argues that this statute effected the termination of the Klamath River Reservation.
The petitioner urges the contrary. It is our task, in
light of the language and purpose of the Act, s well as
of the historical background, outlined above, to determine the proper meaning of the Act and, consequently,
the current status of the reservation.

OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion of the Court

The'respondenrelies upon what he feels is significant
language in the Act and upon references in the legislative
history. He contends, "The fact that the lands were to
be opened up for settlement and sale by homesteaders
strongly militates against a continuation of such reservation status." Brief for. Respondent 3.
We donclude, however, that this is a misreading of the
effect of the allotment provisions in the 1892 Act. The
meaning of those terms is to be ascertaiied from the overview of the earlier General Allotment Act of 1887, 24
Stat. 388. That Act permitted the President to make
allotments of feservation lands to resident Indians and,
with tribal consent, to sell surplus lands. Its policy was
to continue the reservation system and the trust status
of Indian lands, but to allot tracts to individifal Indians
for agriculture and grazing. When all the lands had been
allotted and the trust-expired, the reservation could be
abolished."
Unallotted lands were made available to
non-Indians with the purpose, in part, of promoting interaction between the races and of encouraging Indians to
adopt white ways. See § 6 of the General Allotment Act,
24 Stat. 390; United States Department of the Interior,
FederalIndian Law 115-117, 127-129, 776-777 (1958). 8
17 The trust period on allotments to Indians on the Klamath River
Reservation expired in 1919, bt was later extended by Congress by
the Act of Dec. 24, 1942, 56 Stat. 1081, 25 U. S. C. § 348a.
See S. Rep. No. 1714, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. (1942). And in 1958
Congress restored to tribal ownership vacant and undisposed-of
ceded lands on various reservations, including 159.57 acres on the.
Klamath River Reservation. Pub. L. 85-420, 72 Stat. 121.

History of the Allotment Policy, in Readjustment of Indian Affairs,
Hearings on H. R. 7902 :Before the House Committee on Indian
Affairs, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 428--440(1934). The policy of'allotment and sale of surplus reservation land was repudiated in 1934
by the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 984, now amended
and codified as 25 U. S. C. § 461 et seq.

MATT v ARNETT

497,,

Opinion of the Court

Under the 1887 Act, however, the President was hot required to open reservation land for allotment; he merely
had the discretion to do so.
In view of the discretionary nature of this presidential power, Congress occasionally enacted special legislation in order to assure that a particular reservation
The 1892 Act was
was in fact opened to allotment.'
but one example of this. Its allotment provisiong, which
do not differ materially from those of the General Allotment Act of 1887, and which in fact refer to the earlier
Act, do not, alone, recite or even suggest that Congres§
intended thereby to terminate the Kiamath .River Reservation. See Seymour v. Superintendent, 368 U. S. 351,
357-358 (1962). Rather, allotment under the 1892.Act
is completely consistent with continued reservation status.
This Court unanimously observed, in an analogous setting
in Seymour, id., at 356, "The Act did no morc [in this
respect] than open the way for non-Indian. settlers
to own land on the reservation in a manner which
the Federal Government, acting as guardian and trusted
for the Indians, regarded as beneficial to the development
of its wards." See United States v. Celestine, 215 U. -S.
278 (1909); United States v. Nice, 241 U. S. 591'(1916).
See also Wilbur v. United States, 281 U. S. 206 (1930);
Donnelly v. United States, 228 U. S. 243 (1913).
III
The respondent further. urges, however, that his view
of the effect of the 1892 Act is supported by the Act's refSee, for example, the Act of Mar. 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888 (Sioux
Reservations), and United States v. Nice, 241 U. S. 591 (1916);
the Act of Mar. 22, 1906; 34 Stat. 80 (Colville Reservation), and

erence to "what was [the] JKlamath River Reservation."
According to the respondent, "this reference, and other
references in the legislative history, compel the con.clusion that Congress intended to terminate the reservation in 1892.
The 1892 Act, to be sure, does refer to the Klamath
River Reservation in the past tense. But this is not to
be read as a clear indication of congressional purpose to
terminate. Just a few,,.weeks before the bill (H. R. 38,
52d Cong., 1st Sess.), which eventually became the Act,
was reported out of committee on February 5, 1892,
H. R. Rep. No. 161, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., the President
had formally extended the Hoopa Valley Reservation to
include the Klamath River Reservation. And only "that
portion of the extension which had been the Klamath
River Reservation was the subject of the 1892 Act. The
reference to the Klamath River Reservation in the past
tense seems, then, merely to have been a natural, convenient, and shorthand way of identif ing the land subject to allotment under the 1892 Act.2" We do not believe.
20 The respondent argues, however, that Congress, perhaps unacquainted with the Executive Order of October 1891, intended this
language to convey the view expressed in the House Report, H. R.
Rep. No. 161. supra, 23 Cong. Rec. 1598-1599 (1892), that the
Klamath River Reservation had long been abandoned and, in fact
and in law, had already been terminated.
It is clear from the text, infra,that there were efforts in certain
quarters of the House to terminate the reservation and open it for
white settlement. See Short v. United States, supra,n. 8, at 34-52.
While the respondent's interpretation of the phrase is plausible, it
is no less plausible to conclude, in light of the repeated and un.successful efforts by the House to terminate the reservation, that
the Senate proponents of the legislation were not inclined to make
'their cause (of requiring allotmdnts) less attractive to the House by
amending the bill to refer to the "former Klamath River Reservation, now part of the Hoopa Valley. Reservation" rather than "what
was, rhe] Klamath River Reservaion."

MATTZ v. ARNETT
481

Opinion of. the Court

the reference can be read as indicating any clear purpose
to terminate the reservation directly or by innuendo.
The respondent also points to numerous statements in
the legislative history that, in his view, indicate that'
the reservation was to be terminated. We need not
refer in detail to the cited passages in H. R. Rep. No. 161,
supra, or to the debates on the bill, 23 Cong. Rec. 15981599, 3918-3919 (1892), for there is no challenge here to
the view that the House was generally hostile to continued reservation status of the land in question. In
our estimation, however, this very fact, in proper perspective, supports the petitioner and undermines the
respondent's position.
As early as 1879, there were efforts in Congress to
abolish the Klamath River Reservation. From that date
to 1892 strong sentiment existed to this effect. 'But it
does not appear that termination ever commanded majority support. The advocates of termination argued
that the reservation, as of 1879, long had been abandoned;
that the land was useless as a reservation; and that many
white settlers had moved on to the land and their property should be protected. See H. R. Rep. No. 1354, 46th
Cong., 2d Sess., 5 (1880). That whites had settled there
is clear, but the view that no Indians remained after the
flood of 1861 appears to have been a gross misconcep21
tion on the part of those who sought termination.
The Department of the Interior iook issue with the Committee's
population estimates. H. R. Rep. No. 1148, 47th Cong., 1st Sess.,
1-3 (1882). In a letter transmitted to the Committee on Indian
Affairs in 1881, an infantry lieutenant, acting as Indian Agent, suggested that the Committee's population estimates were "gleaned principally from civilians, who are, I believe, somewhat inclined to lessen
the number, thinking doubtlessly that the smaller the number the
greater the likelihood of its being thrown open to settlers." Id.,

OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion of the Court

412 U. S.

The first bill'providing for public entry and sale of the
Klamath River Reservation was introduced in the Senate
on May 28, 1879. S. Res. 34, 46th Cong., lst Sess.; 9
Cong. Rea. 1651. The resolution referred to the reservation's having been "abandoned" in 1855 " and the tribe
removed to another reservation established for its use."
No action was taken on the bill, and another, of the same
purport, was introduced on January 12, 1880, in the
House.- H. R. 3454, 46th Cong., 2d Sess.; 10 Cong. Rec.
286. 'This bill provided that the reservation "be, and
the same is hereby, abolished," and authorized and directed the Secretary of the Interior to -survey the lands
and have them made subject to homestead and preemption entry and sale."the same as other public lands."
It is clear from the report on this second bill, H. R.
Rep. No. 1354, supra, at 1-5, that the establishment of
the reservation in 1855 was viewed as a mistake and an
injustice. According to the Report, the reservation had
been abandoned after the 1861 freshet, and the Indians
had moved to the Smith River and, later, the Hoopa Valley Reservations. White settlers had moved in and
wished to exploit the lumber and soil of the area which,
some said, "has no equal in California as a fiuit and wine
growing country." Id., at 5. Inasmuch as the reservation blocked access to the river, the resources of the area
could not be developed. Although unmentioned in that
Report, the Office of Indian Affairs opposed the bill See
H. R. Rep. No. 1148,47th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1882). The
bill as reported was recommitted and no further action
was taken. 10 Cong. Rec. 3126 (1880).
An identical bill was introduced in the following Congress. H. R. 60, 47th Cong., 1st Sess.; 13 Cong. Rec. 90
(1881). The Commissioner of Indian Affairs opposed
the bill as introduced, but stated that he would not oppose it if provision for prior allotments to the Indians
was made. H. R. Rep. No. 1148,. spra, at 2. The

MATTZ v. ARNETT
481

501

Opinion of the Court

Commissioner's proposed amendment was approved by
the Committee, 13 Cong. Rec...3414 (1882), but no action
on the bill was taken by the full House.
In 1883 and 1884 three more bills were intro'du~ed.
*It is of interest to note that each acceded to the request
of the Commissioner that provision be made for prior
allotments to resident Indians. H. R. 112, 48th Cong.,
1st Sess.; 15 Cong. Rec. 62 (1883); S. 813, 48th Cong.,
1st Sess.; 15 Cong. Rec. 166 (1883); H. R. 7505, 48th
Cong., -1st Sess.; 15 Cong. Rec. 5923 (1884). Each bill
would have "abolished" the reservation and would have
made the land subject to homestead and pre-emption
entry. None of the bills was enacted, alth6ugh passage
must have been generally regarded as likely, for the Indian Bureau in 1883 began the work of allotment and
survey, perhaps in anticipation of passage.
In 1885 two bills were introduced in the House. Each
was substantially identical to those introduced in 1883,
and 1884. H. R. 158 and H. R. 165, 49th Cong., 1st Sees.;
17 Cong. Rec. 370 (1885). No action was taken on either
bill.
No further bills, apparently, were introduced until
,1889. During the intervening period, however, th6 General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat. 388, was passed and
thereafter amended, 26 Stat. 794. The Rising Star Tea
case, 35 F. 403, was also decided.
In 1889 a bill providing for the allotment of the
Klamath River Reservation was introduced. The allotments, however, were to be made in a manner inconsistent
with the General Allotment Act. H. R. 12104, 50th
Cong., 2d Sess.; 20 Cong. Rec. 756 (1889). And after
affirmance of the Rising Star Tea case by the circuit
court, 38 F. 400 (1889), identical bills were introduced
in the House and the Senate providing, without mention
of allotment, that "all of the lands embraced in what
was Klamath River Reservation ... are hereby de-

clared to be subject to settlement, entiy,.and purchase"
under the land laws. H. R. 113, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.;
21 Cong. Rec. 229 (1889); S. 2297, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.;
21 Cong. Rec. 855 (1890). The Indian Office opposed
the bills, recommending that they be'amended to provide for allotments to the Indians 'under the General
Allotment Act, that surplus lands be restored to the
public domain, and that the proceeds be held in trust
for the Klamath River Indians. See Short v. United
States, No. 102-63, pp. 44-45 (Report' of Commissioner,
Court of Clains, 1972). H. R; 113 was reported out
of committee with certain amendments, including one to
the effect that proceeds arising from the sale of lands were
to be used for the "removal, maintenance, and edfication" of the resident Indians, the Hoopa Valley Reservation being considered the place of removal. Allotments
to the Indians on the Klamath Reservation, however,'
were emphatically rejected. H. R. Rep. No. 1176, 51st
Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1890). The bill was so amended
and passed the House. 21 Cong. Rec. 10701-10702
(1890). It died in the Senate.
In light of the passage of this last bill in the House
and the presence of' the Rising Star Tea opinions, the
Indian Department moved to have the Klamath River
Reservation land protected for the Indians residing there.
The details of this effort, including the opinion of the
Assistant Attorney General, referred to above, are outlined in the Commissioner's report in Short v. United
States, supra,, at 45-50. These efforts culminated in
President Harrison's Executive Order of October 1891 expanding the Hoopa Valley Reservation to include the
Klamath. River Reservation.
It is against this background of repeated legislative
efforts to terminate the reservation, and to avoid allotting
reservation lands to the Indians, that the 1892 Act was
introduced. H. R.,38, 52d Cong., 1st Sess.; 23 Cong.

MATTZ v. ARNETT
481

Opinion of the Court

Rec. 125 (1892). The bill provided for the settlement,
entry, and purchase of the reservation land and specified
that the proceeds should be "ised for the "removal,
maintenance, and education" of the resident Indians.
No allotments were provided for, as the Indians were
'semicivilized, disinclined to labor, and have no conception of land values or desire to cultivate the soil." .H. R.
Rep. No. 161, 52d Cong., 1st'Sess., 1 (1892). The House
Committee on Indian Affairs amended the bill by changing the word "and" to "or" in the proviso relating to the
use of proceeds. Id., at 2.
The bill passed the House without change. 23 Cong.
Rec. 1598-1599 (1892). It was struck out in the Senate,
however, and another version was substituted deleting
reference to the removal of the Indians and providing
that before public sale the land should be allotted to.the
Indians under the General Allotment Act of 1887, as
arrended. Id., at 3918-3919. This substitute measure
had the support of the Interior Department. Id., at
3918. The Senate called for a conference with the House,
id., at 3919, and the conference adopted the Senate version with amendments. Sen. Misc. Doc. No. 153, 52d
Cong., Ist Sess. (1892). The bill was then passed and
became the 1892 Act.

IV
Several conclusions may be drawn fiom this account.
First, the respondent's reliance on the House Report and
on comments made on the floor of the House is not well
plaped. Although the primary impetus for termination
of the Klamath River Reservation had been with the
House since 1871, this effort consistently had failed to
accomplish the very objectives the respondent now seeks
to achieve. Likewise, the House in 1892 failed to accomplish these objectives, for the Senate version, supported
by the Interior Department, was substituted for that of

OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion of- the Court

412 U. S.

the House. Th Senate version, ultimately enacted,
provided for allotments to the-Indiag, and for the proceeds of sales to be held in trust for the "maintenance and
education," not the removal,- of the Indians. The legislative history relied uponrby the respondent does not support the view that the reservation was 'terminated;:
rather, by contrast with the bill as finally enacted, it compels the conclusion that efforts to terminate the reservation 'by denying allotments to the Indians failed
completely.
A second conclusion is also inescapable. The presence
of allotment provisions in the 1892 Act cannot be interpreted to mean that the reservation was to be terminated. This is apparent from the very language of 18
U. S. C. § 1151, defining Indian country "notwithstanding the issuance of ax'y patent" therein.' More significantly, throughout the period from 1871-1892 numerous
bills were introduced which e&pressly provided for the
termination of the reservation and did so in unequivocal
terms. Congress was fully aware of the means by Which
termination could be effected. But "clear termination
language was not employed in the 1892 Act. This being
so, we are not inclined to infer an intent to terminate the
reservation.2 2 The. Court stated in United States v.
Celestine, 215 U. S., at 285, that "'When Congress has
22

Congress has used clear language of express 'termination when
that result is desired. See,' for example, 15 Stat.'221 (1868) ("the
Siaith River reservation is hereby discontinued"); 27 Stat. 63 (1892)
(adopted just two weeks .after the 1892 Act with which this case
is concerned, providing that the North 'Half of the Colville Indian
Reservation, "the same being a portion of the Colville Indian Reservation . . . be, and is hereby, vacated and restored to the public
domain"), and Seymour v. Superintendent, 368 U. S., at 34, 33
Stat. 218 (1904) ("the reservation lines of the said .Ponoa and
Otoe and Missouria Indian reservations be, and the same are hereby,
abolished").

MATTZ -t. ARNETT
481

Opinion of the Court

once est blished a reservation all tracts included within
it remain a part of-the reservation until separated therefrom by Congress." A congressional determination to
terminate must be expressed on the face of the Act or
be clear from the surrounding circumstances and legislative history.. See Seymour v. Superintendent, 3Q8 U. S.
351 (1962); United States v. Nice, 241 U. S. 591 (1916) .23
Finally, our conclusion that theF 1892 Act did not

terminate the Klamath River Reseryation is reinforced
by repeated recognition-of the reservation status of the

land after 1892 by the Department of the Interior and
by Congress.' In"1904 the Department, in Crichton v.
Shelton, 33 1. D. 205, ruled that the 1892 Act reconfirr~ed
the continued existence of the reservation. In 1932 the
Department continued to recognize the Klamath River

Iteservationalbeit as part of the Hoopa Valley Reserva"tion,2 ' and itcontinues to do so today. And Congress
has recognized the reservations continued existence by'
extending the period of trust allotment for this very
reservation by the 1942 Act, described above, 25 U. S. C.

§ 348a, and by restoring td -tribal ownership certain vacait and undisposed-of ceded lands in the reservation by
'the 1958 Act, supra.2
