titled to rely on a directly relevant decision of this Court
which has neither been overruled nor questione. The
Court of Claims ruled that the United States breached
its fiduciary duty by failing to resist payment of Oklahoma's -estate tax on certain trust property held by the
United States acting as trustee for the benefit of the
Osage- Indians.' The Cout of Claims recognized that
this Court, in West v. Oklahoma Tax Commn, 334 U. S.
717 (1948), had squarely upheld the validity of Oklahoma's inheritance tax as applied to restricted Osage
Indians. But the lower court believed that West had
been so undermined by later decisions of this and other
courts that the United States had an obligation to challenge its continuing validity. Since the court also believed that such a schallenge would have been successful,
it upheld both the plaintiffs' claim against the United
States for the amount of the tax and the United States'
third:party claim against Ok1lahoma for indemnification.
-We reverse. We hold that the United States was entitled to rely on West in paying the tax and thus did
not breach its fiduciary obligations. It follows that the
plaintiffs below suffered no compensable damages and that

the claim over by the. United States drops out of the case.

The facts and legal background of this dispute may
be briefly stated. Before 1906, the Osage Reservatioi
waq held in trust for the Osage Tribe by the United
States., In that year, the Osage Allotment Act, 34 Stat.
'The land in question originally belonged to the Cherokee Nation,
but in 1866, the Cherokees entered a treaty with the United States
authorizing the United States to settle friendly Indians in Cherokee
territory. See 14 Stat. 799. Pursuant to this treaty, the Osage
Indians settled the land in question, and in 1883, the Cherokees
conveyed the area to the United States to be held in trust for the

539, -was passed, which divided tribal land equally among
members of the Tribe. However, an individual Indian
was not permitted to alienate the land unless "the Secretary of-the Interior, in his discretion, . .. [issued] ..'.
a certificate of competency, authorizing him to sell and
convey any of the lands deeded him by reason -of
this Act." 2 34 Stat. 542.1 " In addition, the Act
created so-called "headrights" which are each tribal member's individual share of the income derived from the
minerals located on. the land. The minerals and this
income were to be placed in trust for the individual
tribal members, subject fo periodic distribution fromh income, until 1984, when legal title to the minerals together with the accumulated income would vest in- the
individual ITidians. Various -tribal funds were also
placed in -trust until that year. As amended, the Act
provides that land and funds which are either restricted
or held in trust "shall not be subject to lien, levy, attachment, or forced sale ... prior to the issuance of a certificate of competency." 61 Stat. 747.
The decedent in this case, Rose Mason, was an Osage
Indian who had not received a certificate of competency.
Pursuant to the Osage Allotment Act, the United States
held certain of her property in trust for her. Upon
Osige Indians." See West v. Oktah'or.a Tax Comm'n, 334 U. S.
717,
720 (1948).
2
The Act followed the pattern'of the General Allotment Act of
1887, 24 Stat. 388, 25 U. S. C. ยง.331, which empowered the President
to allot reservation land to certain Indians, but from"which the Osage
Indians were omitted.
3The Act has been frequently amended. 78 Stat. 1008; 61
Stat. 747; 52 Stat. 1034; 45 Stat. 1478; 37 Stat. 86.
4 Originally, the Act provided that the property in -question .vuld
vest'in the Indians in 25 years. See 34 Stat. 544. However, au
amendment was passed in 1938 extending the trust period to 1984.

her death intestate, an Oklahoma estate tax return was
filed which included in her gross estate these trust properties. The Federal Government then paid Oklahoma
some $8,087.10 in estate"taxes out of the trust properties.
Although, the decedent's administrators were discharged
in 1968, in 1970 the estate was reopened for the purpose
of permitting the administrators to challenge the United
States' payment of the tax. A suit was filed in the
Court of -Claims alleging that the United States had
breached its fiduciary duty in making the payment,5 and
that court upheld-the claim together with the'United
States' thirdparty -claim against- Oklahoma. See 198
Ct. Cl. 599,461 F. 2d i364 (1972). We granted certiorari
because of the seeming inconsistency between the decision
below and: our prior decision in West v. Oklahoma Tax
Come.'n, supra.0 409 U. S. 1124.
In Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. United 8tates, 319 U. S.
598 (1943), this Court ruled that it'could not infer a
tax immunity extending to estate, taxes on Osage property from the fact that Congress had placed restrictions
on the alienability of the property. -The West Court
extended that ruling to property, such as that involved
in this case, held in trust for the Osage Indians. The
Court held that by placing the property in trust, Con:5The suit was brought under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1491, which gives the
Court of Claims jurisdiction "to render judgment upon any claim
against the bnited States founded either upon the Constitution, or
any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department,
or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or
.for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in
tort."
. Both the United States, as defendant below, and Oklahoma, as
third-party defendant below, petitioned for certiorari. We granted
both petitioas, of. 41 U. S. C. ยง 114 (b), and consolidated the cases.

gress did not intend to immunize it from local taxation.
Moreover, the federal-instrumentality doctrine was found
to be no bar to Oklahoma's estate tax. Although this
doctrine had been used in earlier cases to invalidate state
property taxes on trust property, see, e. g., McCurdy v.
United States, 264 U. S. 484 (1924); United States v.
Rickert, 188 U. S. 432 (1903), the Court distinguished
estate taxes since "[a]n inheritance or estatQ tax is not
levied on the property of which an estate is composed.
Rather it is imposed upon the shifting of economic
benefits and the privilege of transmitting or receiving
such benefits." 334 U. S., at 727." Discerning no congressional intent to immunize Osage trust property from
state taxation and no' constitutional bar to the tax, the
Court upheld Oklahoma's claim.
As the Court of, Claims itself recognized, the West
decision "applied to the very type of trust property now
before us." 198 Ct. Cl., at 609, 461 F. 2d, at 1370.
Nonetheless, the court thought that the rationale of West
had been,substantially undermined by Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U. S.i (1956), which held that the profits from
the sale of timber on the land of a Quinaielt Indian held
in trust for him pursuant to the General' AllQtment Act,
25 U. S. C. ยง 331, was immune from federal capital gains

taxes.
It must be fioted, -however, that the Squire Court did
not purport to-question or overrule West, ahd, indeed,
did not so much as mentio'irthat decision. The Squire
case involved *adifferent tax by a different levl of government bn the'trust propertfes-of a different tribe held
pursuant tp a different statute. As the West decision,
itself made clear, decisions relating to other t:pds of
taxes are not readily transferable to the area of :estate
and gift taxation where the tax is imposed on the transfer
of property rather thdn on the property itself or the

income it generates. Cf. Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S.
115 (1900). Moreover, the Squire decision rested heavily
on the provision in the General Allotment Act providing for the removal of "all restrictions as to sale, encumbrance, or taxation" when Indian property is granted
in fee-a-provision which has no analogue in the Osage
Allotment Act insofar as these trust .properties are
concerned.'
Nor can we agree with the Court of Claims that the
foundations of West have been substantially weakened
by subsequent lower court -decislong. Apart from our
difficulty in comprehending how decisions by lower courts
can ever undermine the authority of a decision of this
Court, we think it clear that:6ach of the cases relied upon
below is distinguishable from West. Thus, whileit is
true that the Ninth Circuit construed the Mission Indian Act, 26 Stat. 712, to invalidate California's estate
tax as applied to a California Mission Indian in Kirkwood v. Arenas, 243 F. 2d 863 .(CA9 1957), the Kirkivood
court carefully distinguished West and recognized its continuing validity. See id.,- at 865. Similarly, the'
Court of -Claims' reliance on jts own decision in Big
Eagle Y. United States, 156 Ct. Cl. 665, 300 F.. Id 765
(1962)' is xnisplaced since that decision, like Squire, con-argue before this Court that oiir- redent decision
in McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n, 411 U. S. 164 (1973),
substantially extended the protection, afforded, Indian tribes against
stite taxation and therefore undermined West. McClanahrn,.howe4er, concerned a state income tax on the.income-.of a reservation
Indian'which-was earned within the reservation-a situation wholly
different from that presented here. Moreoyer, McClanahan cited
Oklahoma. TazComm'i v: United States, 319 U. S. 598'(1943),
the predecessor of West, with approval, and pecifically distinguished
the case of the Osage Indians by holding that "the [Indian sover"eignty] doctrine has not been rigidly applied in cases where'Indians
have left thie reservation and become assimilated into the general
community.' 411 U. S., at 171.

cerned a federal income tax. See also United States v.
Hallam, 304 F. 2d 620 (CA10 1962). And cases such
as Nash v: Wiseman, 227 F. Supp. 552 (WD Okla.
1963), and Asenap v. United States, 283F. Supp. 566
(WD Okla. 1968), are of questionable relevance, since
they arose under the General Allotment Act rather' than
the Osage Allotment Act. Cf. Rev. Rul. 69-164, 1969-1
Cum. Bull. 220.8
Thus, as the Court of Claims itself conceded, "since the
West case in 1948, there has been no holding exactly on
the precise issue now before us--the liability of such
Osage property to state death taxation." 198 Ct. Cl., dt'
613, 461 F. 2d, at 1372. Although it might be fair to
say that over the yearg the fringes of the West doctrine
have been worn away, its core holding remains unimpeached by any decisions of this or any other court.'
We need not decide, however, Whether in a case squarely
presenting the issue, we would continue to adhere to
West. For the issue in this case is not whether West
should be overruled, but rather whether the United
States breached its fiduciary duty in failing to anticipate
that it would be overruled. Cf.. Helvering v. Griffiths,
318 U. S. 371, 394 (1943).1
8 The Court of Claims relied in part upon a Technical Advice
Memorandum issued by the Internal Revenue Service 'to the Oklahoma District Director of Internal Revenue on August 15, 1969.
The Memorandum announced that, henceforth, Osage trust property
would be exempt from federal estate taxation. The court also
pointed ,to Beartrack v. United States, Ct. Cl. No.-281-67, in which
-the United States settled a suit for refund of federal estate taxes
paid on restricted trust properties It is obvious, b.owevet, that
Internal Revenue Service decisions as to the scope of its own taxing
power have no effect on the taxing power of the States.
9As all .parties apparently recognize, the 9cope of the United
States' fiduciary duty in administering the trust property is, a
question of federal law. Cf. Clearfidd Trust Co. v United States,
318 U. S 363 (P%.3).

OCTOBER" TERM, 1972
Opinion of the Court

412 U.S.

When the question is so posed, we think that the answer is obvious. There is no doubt that the United,
States serves in a fiduciary capacity with respect to these
Indians and that, as such, it is duty boun tto exercise
great care in administering its trust. See, e. g.,.Seminole
Nationwv. United States, 316 U. S. 286,296-:297 (1942).
But it has long been recognized that a trustee is not an'
insurer of trust property. As Professor Scott has written, "A trustee is under a duty in administering the
trust to,exercise such care and skill as a man of ordinary
prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property." 2-A. Scott, Trusts 1408 (3d ed. 1967) (hereinafter cited as Scott). See, e. g., Phelps v. Harris, 101
U. S. 370, 383 (1880). It follows that "[i] f the trust'
property is lost or destroyed or diminished in value, the*
trustee is'not subject to-a surcharge unless he failed to"
exercise the required care and skill." 2 Scott 1419.
'Applying these familiar principles to the facts before
us, we are required to decide whether the United States
can be said to have acted with less than the requisite
care in refusing to contest the Oklahoma tax. When the
State asserts a doubtful tax claim against trust property,
the trustee is often presented with a close question.
Normally, the trustee is obligated to pay taxes on the
trust estate, and, indeed, if he negligently fails to do
so, he may be held liable for any resulting penalty. See,
e.g., 2 Scott 1422. 'Yet, as these cases demonstrate, if
he pays the tax, he may similarly be called upon-to reimburse the trust estate for the amount of the tax.
In order to avoid placing a trustee on the horns of'
this dilemma, most courts which have considered the'
problem have given a trustee broad discretion to pay taxes
clanned by the State so long as the trustee's judgment
that the taxes are valid or that the costs and risks of
.litigation -outweigh the advantages is not wholly uurea-

UNITED STATES v. MASON

Oipinion .of the Court

sonable. See, e. g., Crmther.v. Joyce, 146 F. 2d 518, 519
(CA10 1945); Iz re Estate of Miller, 259 Ca!. App. 2d
536; 550, 551, 66 Cal. Rptr. 756, 766 (19168) ;:In re estate
of Wehrha:e, 41 N. J..Super. 158, 166; 124. A. 2d 334
338 (1956),; Henshie v. McPherson & Oitizens State
Bank, 177. Kan. 458, 479, 280 P. 2d 937, 953 (1955);
In re Vanderbilt's Will, 190 Misc. 824, 850, 77 N. Y. S.
2d 403, 427. (1948); Selleck v. Hawley, 331 Mo. 1038,
1056-1057, 56 S. W. 2d 387, 39,-396-(1932).
Thus, even if the West case had never been decided,
the plaintiffs below would still have had difficulty in raking out a case that the .United States had breached its
fiduciary duty by paying the tax. 'But, of .course, West
had been decided at the time the tax" was paid, and-we
therefore deal here with an assertion of taxing authority which was not merely plausible "but' had been ekpressly approved by a decision -of this Court. Generally,
when a trustee is in doubt as to what course to pursue,
the -proper procedure for him to'follow s.i
to conform
his conduct to the instrdotions given him by the courti.
See, e. g., Mosser v. Darrow 341-U.. S.267, 274 (1951).
Here, the United Sfates aid- just *that; -nd plaintiffs
below ask us to find that obedience to the instructions
of this Court constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty.
.t is, of course, true that Supreme Court decisions are
on occasion overruled, and that the opportunity to overrule them would never arise if litigants *didnot continue
to challenge their validity. But, .in this context at least,
it is unnecessary to penalize the United States' proper
reliance. on our past decisions in prder to re-examine
them, since there is no bar to a suit by plaintiffs blow
directly against Oklahoma for recovery of the tax.. Cf.
Poafpybitty v. Skelly. Oil Co., 390 U. S. 365 (1968).
And. if the doctrine of star decisi2 has .any meaning gt
all, it requires that-people in their 6veryday affairs be

able to rely on our decisionqand not be needlessly penalized for such reliance. Cf. Flood v. ,Kuhn, 407 U. S.
258, 283 (1972); Wallace v. M'Connell. 13 Pet. 136, 150

-(1839).
We do not have to-say that a fiduciary may never be
held liable for reliance on prior decisions of this Court.
But, .as the discussion above demonstrates, the .United
States' reliance on.West was reasonable in this situation.
The West decision has, neither been overruled nor questioned in our subsequent cases. It is fully consistent
with later developments, and has been followed without
protest for 24 years. Since we find that the United
States acted with the requisite care and prudence in
following West, the decision below must be reversed with
instructions to enter judgment dismissing the complaint.
So ordered.
MR. JUSTiCE DOUGLAS concurs in the result.
