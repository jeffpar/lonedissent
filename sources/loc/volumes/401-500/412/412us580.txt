UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MISURE
LAND CO., INC., ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 71-1459. Argued January 15-16, 1973-Decided June 18, 1973Pursuait to the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, the United States
acquired land parcels in Louisiana for a wildlife refuge, one by
deed in 1937, the other by condemnation in 1939. Mineral rights
were reserved to the respondent former owners for a period of
10 years, -subject to extension if certain detailed exploration and
production conditions were met, after which complete fee title
was to vest in the United States. The 10-year period expired
without the extension conditions being met. Respondents continued to claim the mineral rights, relying on Louisiana Act 315 of
1940, which, as applied retroactively, provides that mineral rights
reserved in land conveyances to the United States shall be "imprescriptible," thus, in effect, extending indefinitely the former
owners' mineral reservations. The Government brought this suit
to quiet title. The District Court entered summary judgment for
the respondents, concluding that Leiter -Minerals, Inc. v. United
States, 329 F. 2d 85, was dispositive of-the issues, notwithstanding
that that judgment had been vacated by this Court and the
case remanded with instructions to dismiss the cbmplaint as moot.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held: Under settled, principles
governing the choice of law by federal courts, Louisiana's Act
315 of 1940 does not apply to the mineral reservations agreed-to
by the parties in 1937 and 1939. Pp. 59Q-604.
(a) Here, where the land acquisition to which the United States
is a party arises from and bears heavily upon a federal regulatory
programd the choice-of-law task is a federal one for federal courts,
as defined by Clearfied Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363.
Pp. 590-593.
(b) Absence of a provision dealing with choice of law in the
Migratory Bird Conservation Act does not limit the reach of
federal law, as interstitial fed[eral lawmaking is- a basic responsibility of the federal courts. P. 593..
(c) Even assuming that the established body of state property
law should generally govern federal land acquisitions, Act 315,

as retroactively applied, may not, because in determining the
appropriateness of "borrowing" state law, specific aberrant or
hostile state rules do not provide appropriate standards for federal law. Under Act 315 land acquisitions explicitly authorized
by federal statute are made subject to a rule of retroactive imprescriptibility, a rule plainly hostile to the United States, and
one that deprives the United States of bargained-for contractual
interests. Pp. 594-597.
(d) To permit state legislation to abrogate the explicit terms
of a prior federal land acquisition would seridusly impair federal
statutory programs'and the certainty and finality that.are indispensable to land transactions. Pp. 597-599.
(e) Act 315, as applied retrb.ctively, serves no legitimate and
important state interests the fulfillment of which Congress might
have contemplated through application of "borrowed" state law.

Pp. 599-601.
(f) In 1937 and 1939, the Government could not anticipate that
the mineral reservations in issue might be characterized, under
present Louisiana laiv, as indefinite in duration and freely revocable. A late-crystallizing state law doctrine may not modify the
clear and explicit contractual expectations of the United States.
Pp. 602-603.
(g) As it is clear that Act 315 does not apply here, it is not
necessary to choose between "borrowing" some residual state rule
of interpretation or formulating an independent federal "common
law" rule; neither rule is the law of Louisiana, yet either rule
resolves this dispute in the Government's favor. Pp. 603-604.

MR. CHIEF "JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of

the Court.
We granted the writ in this case to consider whether
state law may retroactively abrogate'the terms of writfen
agreements made hy- the United States when it acquires
land for public purposes explicitly authorized by Congress.
The United :States initiated this litigation in 1969
in the' United States District Court for the Western
District of Louisiana, seeking to quiet title to two adjacent parcels of land in Cameron Parish, Louisiana,
which the Government had acquired pursuant- to the
Migratory Bird Conservation Act, .45Stat. 1222,16 U. S. C.
§ 715 et seq., as part of the Lacassine Wildlife Refuge.1
Title to one parcel was acquired -by the United States by
purchase on July 23, 1937; to the other parcel by a judgment of condemnation entered August 30, 1939. Both the
1937 act of sale and the 1939 judgment of condemnation
reserved to the respondent Little Lake Misere oil, gas, sulphur, and other minerals for a period of 10 years from the
date of vesting of title in the United States. 2 The reser"The United States brought two separate suits for this. purpose
under 28 U. S. C. § 1345, which were consolidated by consent pursuant
to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42 (a).

In Frost-Johnson Lumber Co. v. Sailing's Heirs, 150 La. 756,
91 So. 207 (1922), the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to recognize a perpetual "migeral estate" in Louisiana lands, transferable

independently of the overlying surface property. Instead, the
Louisiana Supreme Court declared that "oil and gas in place are
not subject to absolute ownershili as specific things apart from the
soil of which they form part," id., at 858, 91 So., at 243, and 'that
sale or reservation of mineral rights affords no more than a right to
go on the land to search for and reduce to possession all minerals
found. 2 A. Yiannopoulos, Louisiana Civil Law Treatise, Property
§ 99 (1967); H. Daggett, Mineral lights in Louisiana § I (Rev. ed.

vation was to continue in effect "as long [after the initial

ten-year period] as oil, gas, sulphur or other mineral is
produced ... or so long thereafter as [respondents] shall
conduct drilling or reworking operations thereon with no
cessation of more than sixty (60) days consecutively
until production results; and, if production results, so
long as such mineral is produced." The deed and the
judgment of condemnation further recited that at the end
of 10 years or at the end of any period after 10 years
during which the above conditions had not been met,
"the right to mine, produce and, market said oil, gas,
sulphur or other mineral shall terminate . . . and the
complete fee title to said lands shall thereby become
vested in the United States."
The parties stipulated, and the District Court found,
that as to both the parcels in issue here, no drilling, reworking, or other operations were conducted and no minerals were obtained for a period of more than 10 years
following the act 6f sale and judgment of condemnation,
respectively. Thus, under the terms of these instruments, fee title in the United States ripened as of 1947
and 1949, respectively-0 years from the dates of creareservation of mineral rights have been almost consistently classified
as servitudes." Yiannopoulos, supra, § 62, at 183; Daggett, supra,
§ 2.
"Prescription" or expiriation of the remedy to protect a mineral
servitude will occur at the end of 10 years from the date of creation,
if the servitude is not maintained during that time in accordance
with complex requirements for use or acknowledgment. The parties
may not extend the 10.-year period of-prescription by advance agreement, see Art. 3460, La. Civ. Code Ann., Hightower v. Maritzky,
194 La. 998, 1006-1007, 195 So. 518, 520-521 (1940). However, the
parties are not barred from agreeing to a period of contractual prescription shorter thqn 10 years. Nabors, The Louisiana Mineral

tion In 1955, the United States issued oil and gas leases
applicable to the laids in question.
Respondents, hofwe- er, continued to-.claim the mineral
rights and-accordingly entered various transactions purporting- to dispose of those rights. Respondents relied
upon Louisiana Act 315 of 1940, La7 Rev. Stat. § 9:5806 A
(Supp. 1973), which-provides:'"When land is acquired by conventional deed or
contract, condemnation or expropriation proceedings
by the United States of. America, or any of its subdivisions or agencies from any person,, firm or corporation, and by the act of acquisition, order or judgment, oil, gas or other minerals or royalties are reserved,-or the land so acquired is-by the act of acquisition conveyed subject to a prior sale or reservation
of oil, gas or other minerals or royalties, still in
force and effect, the rights so reserved or previously
sold shall be imprescriptible."
'
Respondents contended that the 1940 enactment rendered inoperative the conditions set forth in 1937 and
1939 for the extinguishment of the reservations. TheDistrict Court concluded that the Court of Appeals'
prior decision in Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 329
F. 2d 85 "(CA5 1964), required resolution of this case
in favor of respondents, notvithstandihg that we had
vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment in- Leiter Min-,
erals and remanded with instructions to dismiss the
complaint as moot. 381 U. S. 413 (1965). The Court
of Appeals affirmed, for the reasons stated in its Leiter
Minerals holding. .,It rejected the Government's Contraot Clause and Supremacy Clause objections on the
authority of United States v. Nebo Oil Co., 190 F. 2d
1003 (CA5 1951), and further rejected the Government's
argument that'Act 315 was unconstitutionally discriminatory against the United States. The Court of Appeals

observed "thai the same principle applies to acquisitions
by the State of Louisiana [La. Rev. Stat. § 9.5806B], and"
that the act really does nothing more than place citizens
of Louisiana in the same position as citizens of other
states whose land has been purchased or. condemned by
the United States." 453 F. 2d 360..362 (1971). We

Litigation involving Act 315 began more than a quarter
century ago. The Leiter Minerals case, upon which the
Court of'Appeals based its decision in this case, is only
the principal holding in the area. The first case to arise
involving Act 315, Whitney Nat. Bank v. Little
Creek Oil Co., grew out of a 1932 sale of mineral rightsthat specified a 10-year -period of prescription. -The
surface property was conveyed to the United States in
1936, subject to the 1932 mineral sale, and in 1947 the
question arose whether Act 315 of 1940 had the effect of
extending -indefinitely the servitude created by the
1932 sale. The Louisiana Supreme Court held that
Act 315 of 1940 was fully applicable to the 1936 transaction---"not becafise there is anything in ihe terms of
the statute to indicate that it was intended to have a
retroactive application, but because of the general rule
of law established by the jurisprudence of this court
that laws of prescription and those limiting the time
within which actions may be brought are retrospective in
:their operation." 212 La. 949, 958, 33 So. 2d 693, 696
(1947).' The court acknowledged the contention that ff
3
Louisiana law distinguishes between prescription and "peremption." The Louisiana Supreme Court has explained the distinction
in the following terms: "'When a statute creates a right of action,
and stipulates the delay within which that right is 'to be executed,
the delay thus fixed is not, properly speaking, one of prescription,
but it is one of peremption. Statutes of prescription simply bar the

Act 315 were applied retroactively, it might be unconstitutional, but dismissed the constitutional issue without
resolving it for failure to join the United States, a necessary party.
Whitney Bank set the stage for the first federal court
test of Act 315, as construed to have retroactive application, in United States v. Nebo Oil Co., supra,
aff'g 90 F. Supp.. 73 (WD La. 1950). There the
United States brought suit against Nebo Oil (the
sudcessor to the 1932 uiaineral purchaser of the Whitney
Bank, case) to secure a declaratory judgment that the
United States owned the acreage it purchased in 1936
subject only to the 10-year rule of prescription specified at the" time of the original 1932 sale of mineral
rights. But the Court of .Appeals upheld the application of Act, 315 to the previously consummated transaction, stressing that reversionary estates are unknown
in Louisiana law and that, as a result, the United States
in 1936 took "nothing more than a mere expectation, or
hope, based upon an anticipated continuance of the applicable general laws. .. [This] mere expectaney-....
cannot be regarded as a vested right protected by the
Constitution." -190 F. 2d, at 1008-1009.4
remedy. Statutes of peremption destroy the cause of action itself.
That is to say, after the limit of time expires the cause of action
no longer exists; it is lost."' Brister v. Wray Dickinson Co., Inc.,
183 La. 562, 565, 164 So. 415, 416 (1935), cited in United States v.
Nebo Oil Co., 90 F. Supp. 73, 80 (WID La. 1950). Because statutes of
.prescription are considered "remedial" the Louisiana courts have
generally held that such statutes are applicable to causes of action
which arose before the statute was enacted. United States v. Nebo
Oil Co., supra, at 81-82, and cases cited.
4The Court of Appeals also emphasized that officials of the Department of Agriculture had represented to the Government's vendor
that "the prescriptive provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code would'
not apply to lands sold to the United States for national forest purposes." 190 F. 2d 1003, 1005. The Court of Appeals noted that the

UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MISERE LAND CO. 587
580

Opinion of the Court

In the Leiter Minerals litigation, retrospective application of Act 315 to a detailed, conditional mineral reservation was in issue for the first time. Leiter Minerals,
Inc., succeeded to the interests of the Leiter family, which
in 1938 had sold a substantial tract in Plaquemines Parish,
Louisiana, to the United States. Leiter's federal sale
was subject to a mineral reservation in Leiter's favor,
providing in essence that the reservation would be extended for five years beyond its initial 10-year duration whenever commercially advantageous mineral extraction had occurred during 50 days of a defined period5
At the expiration of any period during which the conditions for extension had not been met, the right to mine

would terminate "and complete fee in the land becomes
vested in the 'United States." The mineral reservation
expired by its own terms; the Government granted a
valuable mineral lease; arid Leiter invoked Act 315 to
support its claim to a servitude of continuing duration.
After a false start in the Louisiana courts, the ensuing litigation found its way into a federal forum.
The United States sued in the Eastern District of Louisiana to quiet title and to enjoin the concurrent state
court proceedings initiated by Leiter. The Court of Appeals affirmed an injunction granted by the District
price paid by the Goveriunent did not reflect the value of any mineral
rights and that the vendor would not have agreed to the land -sale
absent the Government's representation that Louisiana prescriptive
law would- not apply. Id., at 1006.
5The initial duration of the reservation was 10 years. If mineral
operations took place for "an average of at least 50 days per year"
during the final three years of the specified term, the servitude
would be extended for an additional five-year period, but only with
respect to "an area of twenty-five acres of land" around each well
or mine producing or being drilled at the "time of first extension."
Additional five-year extensions could be obtained "from time to time"
to permit completicW of active drilling operations,

'Court,, and this Court agreed, but remanded to the Court
of Appeals with instructions to secure an authoritative
construction bf Acjt.315 before proceeding to the difficult
constitutional issues in the case. Leiter Minerals, Inc.
v. United States, 352 U. S. 220, 229 (1957).'
Adhering to the terms of the remand, Leiter sought a
declaratory judgment in the Louisiana courts, which expressed some continuing doubt over the breadth of their
responsibility for resolving the Leiter controversy on iAs
own facts. Ultimately, the Louisiana Supreme-Court
took jurisdiction of the case and rendered a declaratory
judgment limited to general elucidation of Act 315,
without applying the Act to the specific terms of the
Leiter mineral reservation itself. Leiter Minerals, Inc.
v. California Co., 241 La. 915, 132 So. 2d 845 (1961).
The Louisiana Supreme Court expressed its conclusions
as follows:
"First, that if the reservation in the Leiter deed
is construed as establishing a mineral servitude for
a definite, fixed, and specified time which has elapsed,
then Act 315 of "1940 is not applicable and cannot
be constitutionally applied; and second, that if the
reservation is construed as not establishing a-servitude for a fixed, -definite and certain time, and if

The .1957 remand was in effect a remand with instructions to abstain. It contemplated -,state court elucidation of
various uncertainties surrounding Act 315, before this Conrt would
attempt "to decide their relation to the issues in the case." We do'
not, therefore, understand 'the respondents' suggestion, echoed by
MR. JVSTicE STWART, that the 1957 remand foreshadowed final
resolution of the Leiter Minerals controversy through state law.
Indeed, the Court's opinion stated that "[ilt. need hardly'be
added that the state courts ...can decide definitively only questions
of state law that are not subject to overriding federal law." 352
U. S.220, 229-230.

UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MISERE LAND CO.

Opinion of the Court

it is decided that the provisions of the reservation
show -that the parties were stipulating for a period
of contractual prescription for the conditional extinguishment of the mineral servitude created, then
Act 315 of 1940 is applicable and constitutional."
Id., at 942, 132 So. 2d, at 854-855.
Recognizing that "the interpretation of this reservation
is for the United States courts, and not for us in this
proceeding," id., at 930, 132 So. 2d, at 850, that court
nevertheless hinted broadly that it viewed the Leiter
reservation as one establishing a reservation for an indefinite period of time, and thus one subject to retroactive
application of Act 315.- See id., at 936, 938, 132 So. 2d,
at 852, 853.
The parties then returned to federal court. The District Court held that the mineral reservation in the
Leiter deed created a mineral servitude for a fixed period
and that, under the terms of the Louisiana Supreme
Court's declaratory ruling, as a matter of state law the
reservation was not affected by Act 315. 204 F. Supp.
560 (ED La. 1962). The Court of Appeals reversed.
It rejected the Government's contention that federal
law controlled the rights of the United States under
the -reservation, and held, instead, that those rights were
to be governed by Louisiana law. The Court of Appeals
believed that the Louisiana Supreme Court had viewed
Leiter's servitude as "one of indefinite duration" and it
agreed with that view. Under Louisiana law, therefore, the reservation "provide[d] for a contractual
prescription for the cQnditional exthiguishment of
the. mineral servitude which was rendered inoperative by [Act 315]." 329 F. 2d, at 93. As to the
Governmeiit's' contention that the Act, as so construed, unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of
contract, the Court of Appeals concluded that the dis-

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

cussion of that matter in its prior decision in Nebo Oil,
supra, and in the Louisiana Supreme Court's Leiter opinion, made it, "unnecessary further to labor" the point.
Id., at 94. Judge Gewin dissented. On.being advised by
the parties that the case had been settled, we granted certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and
remanded the cause to the District Court with instructions
to dismiss the complaint as moot. 381 U. S. 413 (1965).
II
The essential premise of the Court of Appeals' dt'cision
in the Leiter Minerats case was that state law governs
the interpretation of a federal land acquisition authorized by the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The
Court of Appeals did not set forth in detail the basis
for this premise,8 but that court's opinion seems to say
8

In Leiter Minerals, the Court of Appeals stated that, although
"Congress could make federal law applicable;. . . it had no intention to do so when it merely authorized the contract by which
the United States acquired the [Leiter] property." The Court of
Appeals expressed the view that "[s~tate law must govern in the
absence of a federal statute," and in support of its view it -ited
Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18 (1.842). Later in its opinion, the
Court of Appeals stated that "since the United. States had the
right to invoke federal jurisdiction (28 U. S. C. § 1345), the ultimate
responsibility for the interpretation of the reservation rests upon
the federal courts. That interpretation, however, must be in accordance with State law . . . ." 329 F. 2d 85, 90, 91. From these
statements, it appears that the Court of Appeals considered that
the interpretation of the Leiter agreement was governed'by state
law (applied of its own force), with the role of the federal courts confined to interpretation of state law "in accordance with State law"
as laid down by the highest courts of the State. Possibly, though,
the Court of Appeals thought that the choice of applicable law
was itself a question of federal law ("ultimate' responsibility . . .
rests upon the federal courts . . .") but that in the general
context of this case, involving real property, state law should be
applied through "borrowing."

UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MIERE LAND CO. 591
580

Opinion of the Court

that state law governs this land -acquisition because, at
bottom, it is an "ordinary" "local" land transaction to
which the United States happens to bd a party. The
suggestion is that this Court's decision in Erie R. Co. v.
Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), compels, application of
state law here because thb Rules of Decisions Act, 28
U. S. -C.§ 1652,1 requires application of state law in the
absence of an explicit congressional command to the
contrary. We disagree.
The federal jurisdictional grant -over suits brought by
the United States is not in itself a mandate for'applying
federal law in all circumstances. This principle follows
from Erie itself, where, although the federal courts had
jurisdiction over diversity cases, we held that the federal
courts did not possess the power to develop a concomitant body of general federal law. Mishkin, The Variousness of "Federal Law": Competence and Discretion
in the Choice of National and State Rules for Decision,
105 U. Pa. L. Rev. 797, 799 (1957). It is trde,:tbo, that
"[t]he great body of law in this country .which controls
acquisition, transmission, and transfer of property, and
defines the rights of its owners in relation to the state or
to private parties, is found in the statutes and decisions of
the state." Davies Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S.
144, 155 (1944). Even when federal general law was in
its heyday, an exception was carved out for local laws of
real property. Swift v. Tyson, 16 Pet. 1, 18 (1842);
see Kuhn v. FairmontCoal Co., 2M5 U. S.349, 360 (1910)2 Indeed, before Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, supra, this
Court's opinions left open the possibility that even "ttie
United States, while protected by the Constitution from
"The Jaws of the several states, expeint wbere the Constitution
or treaties of the United States or Acts of. Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in civil actions
in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply."

discriminatory state action, and perhaps certain other special forms of state control, was nevertheless governed generally in its ordinary proprietary relations by state law."
Fart, The Relations Between State and Federal Law,
54 Col. L. Rev. 489, 533 (1954). See, e. g., Mason v.
United States, 260 U. S. 545, 558 (1923).
Despite this arguable basis for its reasoning the Court
of Appeals in the instant case seems not to have recognized that this land acquisition, like that in Leiter Minerals, is one arising from and bearing heavily upon a
federal regulatory program. Here, the choice-of-law task
is a federal task for federal courts, as defined by Clearfield
Trust Co. v. United States, 318. U. S. 363 (1943). Since
Erie, and as a corollary of that decision, we have consistently acted on the assumption that dealings which
may be 'ordinary" or "local" as between private citizens
raise serious questions of national sovereignty when they
arise in the context of a specific constitutional or statutory provision; particularly is this so when transactions
undertaken by the Federal Government are involved, as
in this case." in such cases, the Constitution or Acts of
10 This is not a case where the United States seeks to oust state
substantive law on the basis of "an amorphous doctrine of national
sovereignty" divorced from ,any specific constitutional or statutory
provision and premised solely on the argument "that every authorisad activity of the United States represents an exercise of its
governmental poxier," see United States v. Burnison, 339 U. S. 87,
91 and 92 (1950); United States V. Fox, 94 U. S. 315 (1877).
Burnison and Fox stand at the opposite end of the spectrum from
cases where Congress explicitly displaces state law in the course
of exercising clear constitutional regulatory power over a particular'
subject matter. See, e. g., Sunderland v. United States, 266 U. S.
226, 232-233 (1924) (United States may displace Oklahoma law by
imposing restrictions on alienation of Indian property despite the
"general rule.. . that the tenure, transfer, control and disposition
of real property are matters which rest exclusively with the State
where the property lies"). The present case falls between the poles

UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MISERE LAND CO. 593
580

Opinion of the Court

Congress "require" otherwise than that state law govern
of its own force.
There will often be no specific federal legislation governing a particular transaction to which the United States
is a party; here,, for example, no provision of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act guides us to choose state
or federal law in interpreting federal land acquisition
agreements under the Act. But silence on that score
in federal legislation is no reason for limiting the reach
'of federal law, as the Court of Appeals thought in Leiter
Minerals. To the contrary, the inevitable incompleteness presented by all legislation means that interstitial
federal lawmaking is a basic responsibility of the federal
courts. "At the very least, effective Constitutionalism
requires recognition of power in the federal courts
to declare, as a matter of common law or 'judicial legislation,' rules which may be .necessary. to fill in interstitially or otherwise effectuate the statutory patterns
enacted in the large by Congress. In"other words, it
must mean recognition of federal judicial competence
to declare the governing law in an area comprising issues
substantially related to an established program 'of government operation." Mishkin, 105 U. Pa. L. Rev., at
800.
This, then, is what has aptly been described as the
"first" of the two holdings of Clearfield Trust Co. v.
United States, supra-that the right of the United States
to seek legal redress for duly authorized proprietary transactions "is a federal right, so that the courts of the
United States may formulate a rule of decision."

least this first step of the Clearfield analysis is applicable
here. We deal with the interpretation of a land acquisition agreement (a) r¢xplicitly authorized, tlough not precisely governed, 4-v the Migratory Bird Conservation Act
and (b) to which the United States itself is a party. Cf.
Bank of Ameri-a v. Parnell, 352 U. S. 29, 33 (1956). As
in Clearfield and its progeny, "[tihe duties imposed upon
the United States and the rights acquired by it ..... find
their roots in the same federal sources ....
In 'absence
of an applicable Act of Congress if is for the federal
courts to fashion the governing rule of law according to
their own standards." 318 U. S., at 366-367; United

The next step in our analysis is to determine whether
the 1937 and 1939 land acquisition agreements in issue
should be interpreted according to "borrowed" state lawAct 315 of 1940. The availability of this choice was explicitly recognized in Clearfield Trust itself 2 and fully
elaborated some years later in United States v. Standard
Oil Co., supra. There we acknowledged that "in many
situations, and apart from any supposed influence of the
Erie decision, rights, interests and legal relations of the
United States are determined by application of.state law,
where Congress has not acted specifically." 332 U. S., at

be applied is a question "of federal policy, affecting not
merely the federal judicial establishment and the groundings of its action, but also the Government's legal interests and relations, a factor not controlling in the types of
cases producing and governed by the Erie ruling. And
the answer to be given necessarily is dependent upon a
variety of considerations always relevant to the nature
of the specific governmental interests and to the effects
upon them of applying state law." Id., at 309-310.

qualification, that land acquisition agreements of the

case on such broad terms. For even if it be assumed
that the established body of state property law should
generally govern federal land acquisitions, we are persuaded that the particular rule of law before us todayLouisiana's Act 315 of 1940, as retroactively appliedmay not. The "reasons which may make state law at

that "the .congressional purpose can best be accomplished by application of settled state rules as to what

retroactive imprescriptibility, a rule that is plainly hostile
to the interests of the United States. As applied to a
consummated land transaction under a contract which
specifically defined conditions for prolonging the vendor's mineral reservation, retroactive application of Act
315 to the United States deprives it of bargained-for
contractual interests.
To permit state abrogation of the explicit terms of a
federal land accuisition would deal a serious blow to the
congressional scheme contemplated by the Migratory
Bird Conservation Act and indeed, all other federal
land acquisition programs. These programs are national
in scope. They anticipate acute and active bargaining
by officials of the United States charged with making
the best possible use of limited federal conservation appropriations. Certainty and finality are indispensable in
any land transaction, but they are especially critical
when, as here, the federal officials carrying out the mandate of Congress irrevocably commit scarce funds.
The legislative history of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act confirms the importance of contractual cerz
tainty to the federal land acquisition program it authorizes. As originally enacted in 1929, the Act provided
that land acquisitions might include reservations, easeby the United States of America, the State of Louisiana, or any of its
subdivisions . . . for use in any public work and/or improve-

"The Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929 established the
Federal policy for the acquisition of areas for migratory waterfowl
refuges. UAder-the provisions of that act, the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized when purchasing property for waterfowl
refuges, to make certain reservations to be retained by the vendors
of the property, but these reservations were subjected to regulations
of the Secretary of Agriculture which might be made 'from time

harassments in the acquisition of desirable waterfowl areas because
some owners are not willing to convey their lands to the Federal
Government on the indefinite and uncertain terms as provided in
regulations made 'from time to time.'
"Obviously they may well be justified in their view, and, just as
obviously, the Government may reasonably be secured in its interests by providing for enjoyment on the reservations under regulations to be stated in the conveyance at the time of its execution,
leaving the vendor who has made the reservation to the general
requirement of existing law that he will be subject to the rules and
regulations of the Secretary of Agriculture governing the general
administration of the area as a migratory bird refuge.
"Accordipgly it is proposed to amend section 6 of the act of

modification of the contractual terms specified by the"
United States itself as vendee, whether or not those
terms may be characterized as "rules and regulations"
within the meaning of the Act.
Conceivably, our conclusion might be influenced if
Louisiana's Act 315 of 1940, as applied retroactively,
served legitimate and important state interests the fulfillment of which Congress might have contemplated
through application of state law. But that is not the
case. We do not deprecate Louisiana's concern with
facilitating federal land acquisitions by removing uncertainty on the part of ieluctant vendors over the duration of mineral reservations retained by them. From
all appearances, this concern was a significant force
behind the enactment of the 1940 legislation.
But
today 'we are not asked to consider Act 315 on its face,

bility by the State of mineral interests in the large federal
land holdings in Louisiana, otherwise in doubt by virtue
of the arcane and fluctuating doctrines of inte'rgovernmental tax immunity; and to ensure that federal mineral
interests could be subjected to state mineral conservation laws without federal pre-emption. 8 We are not
unsympathetic to Louisiana's concern for the consequences of a continuing, substantial, even if contingent,
federal interest in Louisiana minerals. Congress, however, could scarcely have viewed that concern as a proper
justification for retroactive application of state legislation which effectively deprives the Government of its
bargained-for contractual interests. Our Federal Union

legitimately be simplified through the inviting expedient

"One of the important sources of revenue of the State of Louisiana is the severance tax which is levied and collected by the state
when natural resources such as oil and gas are produced and extracted from the land. If the mineral rights were owned by the
federal government in lands which the government had purchased,
the mineral owner's share of the oil and gas produced from these
lands would not, be subject to taxation by the State of Louisiana,
and the state would be deprived of large sums in taxes, especially
since an immense area is owned by the federal government in oilproducing sections of this state, as the very facts of this, case
disclose.
"Moreover, the State of Louisiana in the exercise of its police
power has authority to protect, conserve, and replenish the natural
resources of the state and to prohibit and prevent their waste....
Under this power the Legislature has adopted laws regulating and
controlling the production of oil and gas within the state. By

legislation that subjects the State and certain of its subdivisions to
the rule of imprescriptibility. Louisiana Act 278 of 1953, La. Rev.
Stat. § 9:5806 B' (Supp. 1973). But this belated effort at statutory
parity does not eliminate the adverse effect upon the United States,
and upon the Migratory Bird Conservation Act, of retroactive application of Act 315 of 1940. For one thing, it is not clear whether
the 1958 legislation will be given full retrospective effect by the
Louisiana courts, reaching back to 1937 and earlier. More basic,
even assuming retrospective application of the 1958 -tatute, the
effect of the 1958 'statute on Louisiana is not comparable to the
effect of the 1940 Aot'on the United States. With or without legislation- relating to prescription of mineral interests tied to governmental land acquisitions, Louisiana could plainly apply its own
conservation laws and its own severance tax to any property in
which the State held a contingent or even a present mineral interest.
The 1958 legislation did nothing to reduce Louisiana's freedom in
this respect. . Act 315 of .1940, however, as applied retroactively, had
the avowed purpose and would have the clear.effect of permitting
taxation and conservation: regulation of minerals which, quite possibly, would otherwise fall within the Federal Government's exclusive
domain, However parallel the two statutes in purpose and in their
potential .effect on actual mineral right ownership by the respective
sovereigns, it is only Act 315 of 1940 that significantly affects interests of the United States in intergovernmental immunity.

no bearing on our conclusion that after-the-fact modification of explicit contractual terms would be adverse to
the United States and contrary to the requirements of
the Migratory Bird Conservation Act.
It is also of no import that, under Louisiana law as
it might be articulated in 1973, the United States acquired
from respondents only the reversion to a mineral interest
of indefinite duration, a "hope" or "expectancy" revocable
at any tine by after-enacted legislation. Respondents
place heavy reliance on the opinion of the. Louisiana
Supreme Court in Leiter Minerals, where that court held
that a mineral reservation for an indefinite duration
was one traditionally subject to retroactive prescriptive
change. But even if this rule of law could have been
anticipated in 1937 and 1939, when the United States
agreed to the mineral reservations in issue- here, that
the 1937 and 1939 reservations were of "indefinite" duration could not have been. Indeed, some 20 years later,
in 1957, when Leiter Minerals came to this Court for the
first'time, we were not in a position to resolve the Government's contention that the Leiter reservation was one
of specific duration. Uncertainty over this question of
Louisiana law was- the guiding force behind our remand
in hopes of obtaining the view of the Louisiana Supreme
Court. In its advisory opinion, the Louisiana Supreme
Court did not decide whether the Leiter-type reservation was "indefinite" and subject to retroactive modifieation-to the extent that the Federal District Court,
in Louisiana, subsequently concluded that the servitude in the Leiter reservation was not, under state law,
freely revocable. .In Leiter Minerals, one Court of
Appeals judge dissented on this state law issue, and, with
reason, the Government renews the issue before the Court'
in this case.
Were the terms of the mineral reservations at issue
here less detailed and specific, it might be said that the

UNITED STATES v. LITTLE LAKE MISERE LAND CO. 603

Opinion of the Court

Government acknowledged and intended to be bound by
unforeseeable changes in state law. But the mineral reservations before us are flatly inconsistent with the respondents' suggestion that the United States in fact
expected that these reservations would be wholly subject
to retroactive modification. Nor, given the absence of
any reliable contemporaneous Louisiana signpost and the
abisence even today of any final resolutioi of the pertinehit
state law question, can we say that the United States
ought to have anticipated that its deed contained an
empty promise. Respondents' reliance on the Louisiana
Supreme Court's holding in its opinion in 1961 in Leiter
Minerals assumes that a late-crystallizing doctrine of
state -law is appropriately applied to modify the expectations of the United States established by the terms of
1937 and 1939 bargains. The argument, however, is indistinguishable from respondents' defense of Act 315
itself. Years after the fact, state law may" not redefine
federal contract terminology "in a way entirely strange

In speaking of the choice of law to be applied, the
alternatives are plain although in this case identifying
them in fixed categories is somewhat elusive. One
"choice" would be.to apply the law urged on us by respondents, i. e., Louisiana Act 315 of 1940. In some circumstances, such as those suggested by RFC v. Beaver
County, 328 U. S.204 (1946), or Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63 (1966),21 state
law may be found an acceptable choice, possibly even

is readily distinguishable from the instant case; there

two private parties. That presented "no significant threat to *any
identifiable federal policy or interest." 384 U. S. 63, 68.

when the United States itself. is a contracting party.
However, in a setting in which the rights of the United
States are at issue in a contract to which it is' a
party and "the issue's outcome bears some relationship
to a federal program, no rule may be applied which would
not be wholly in accord with that program." Mishkin,
105 U. Pa. L. Rev., at 805-806.
Since Act 315 is plainly not in accord with the federal
program implemented by the 1937 and 1939 land acquisitions, state law is not a permissible choice here. The
choice of law merges with the constitutional demands
of controlling federal legislation; we turn away from
state law by default. Once it is clear that Act 315 has
no application here, we need not choose between "borrowing" some residual state rule of interpretation or
formulating an independent federal "common law" rule;
neither rule is the law of Louisiana yet, either rule resolves this dispute, in the Government's favor. The
contract itself is unequivocal; the District Court con-cluded, and it is not disputed here, that by the clear and
explicit terms of the contract reservations, "[respondents'] interests in the oil, gas, sulphur and other minerals terminated .... no later than July 23, 1947, and
August 30, 1949, unless Act 315 of 1940 has caused the
reservations of the servitudes in favor of [respondents]
to be imprescriptible."
We hold that, under settled principles governing the
choice of law by federal courts, Louisiana's Act 315 of
1940 has no application to the mineral reservations agreed
to by the United States and respondents in 1937 and
1939, and that, as a result, any contract interests of respondents expired bn'the dates identified by the District
Court. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals -and remand the case for entry of an
order -cnsistent with this opinion.

MR.JusmcE STEVART, concurring in the judgment.
I cannot agree with the Court that the mineral reservations agreed to by the United States and the respondents in 1937 and 1939 are governed by some brooding
omnipresence labeled federal common law. It seems
clear to me, As a matter of law, not a matter of "choice"
or "borroWing," that when anyone, including the Federal
Government, goes into a State and acquires real property,
the nature and extent of the rights created are to be
determined, in the absence of a specifically applicable
federal statute, by the law of the .State.
That was the very premise of the decision in Leiter
Minerals, Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S. 220, 228-230
(1957), which remanded the case to the Court of Appeals
with instructions to secure an authoritative construction
of the state statute by the state courts, in order possibly
to avoid deciding the federal constitutional issues. Other
decisions of this Court lead to the. same conclusion.
United States v. Yaze l,382 U. S. 341, 352-358 (1966);
United States v. Burnison,339 U. S.87, 89 (1950) ; Dames
Warehouse Co. v. Bowles, 321 U. S. 144, 155 (1944);

Cf. Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S.

Since I think the Government's property acquisitions
here are controlled by state law, the decisive question for
me is whether the retroactive application of LouisianaAct
315 of 1940 to those acquisitions is constitutional.' The
1937 deed of purchase and the 1939 condemnation judgIThus, I do not suggest, as the Court seems to think I do (ante,
at 588 n. 7), that this controversy can necessarily be finally resolved
through state law. Rather, my analysis is wholly consistent with
the statement in.Leiter Mineraks, Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S.-220,
229-230 (1957), quoted by the Court today (ante, at 588 n.7), that

ment were unequivocal: the mineral rights were reserved
to the former owners of the land for a 10-year period, after
which time-if certain conditions regarding exploration
and production were not met-the reserved rights were
to terminate, and complete fee title to the land, including the mineral rights, was to become vested in the
United States. The Federal Government bargained for
this contingent future interest in the minerals; it was
clearly agreed to in the conveyances, and was thus reflected in the consideration paid by the Government to,
the former owners.
Yet the Court of Appeals held that Louisiana Act 315,
which was enacted subsequent to those conveyances, operated to abrogate the agreed-upon terms of the mineral
reserations by eliminating the Government's future interest. This retroactive application of Act 315, I believe,
is a textbook example of a violation of Art. I, § 1r0, cl. 1,
of the Constitution, w4ich provides that no State shall
pass any law 'inripairing the Obligation of Contracts."2
Accbrdingly, I concur:in the judgment of the Court.
Mi. JUSTICE RE;RNQuIsT, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with my BRorH'ER STEW-ART that the central
question presented by this case is whether Louisiana has
the constitutional power to make Act 315 applicable to
this transaction, and not whether a judicially created
rule of decision, labeled federal common law, should
state courts "can decide definitively only questions of state law that
are2 not subject to overriding federal law."
This case is a far cry from Home Building & Loan Assn. v.
Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398. (1934), which upheld, in the face of a challenge based on the Contract Clause, emergency state legislation enacted to cope with the extraordinary economic depression existing in
1934. The retroactive application of Louisiana Act 315 serves no
such paramount state interest. Cf. City of El Paso v. Simmons,
379 U. S. 497 (1965).

displace state law. The Migratory Bird Conservation
Act does not establish a federal rule controlling the rights
of the United States under the reservation. Whether
Congress could enact such-a provision is a question not
now before us. In Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States,..
318 U. S.' 363, 366 (1943), this Court held that federal
common law governed the rights and duties of the United
States "on commercial-paper which it issues ... ." The
interest in having those rights governed by a rule which_
is uniform across the Nation was the basis of that decision. But the interest of the Federal Government in
having real proprty acquisitions that it makes in the
States pursuant to a particular federal program governed
by a similarly uniform rule is too tenuous to invoke the
Glearfield principle, especially in light of the consistent
statements by this Court that state law governs real
property transactions.
What for my Brother STEWART, however, is a "text-book exdmnple" of a violation of the Obligation of Contracts Clause, is for me something more difficult. The
scope of this clause has been restricted by past decisions
of the Court such as Home Building & Loan Assn. v.
Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398 (1934), in which a Minnesota
statute extending the period of time in which the mortgagor might redeem his equity following foreclosure was
upheld in the face of vigorous arguments that the statute
impaired a valid contract. Were there no simpler grofind
for disposing of the case, it would be necessary to resolve
this very debatable question.
I believe that such another ground is present here, in
view of the facf that Act 315 enacted by Louisiana by
its terms applie; only to transactions in which "the
United States of America, or any of its subdivisions or
agencies" is a party. While it is argued that Louisiana
by other legislation made the same principle applicable

to the state goverfiment, this proposition is, as the Court's
opinion points out, by no means demonstrated. And in
any event the change in the period of prescriptibility was
not made applicable to "hongovernmental grantees.
Implicit in the holdings of a number of our cases
dealing with state taxation and regulatory measures applied to the Federal Government is that such measures
must be nondiscriminatory. See, e. g., James v. Dravo
Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134 (1937); New York v.
United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946); RFC v. Beaver
County, 328 U. S. 204, 210 (1946).
The doctrine of intergovernmental immunity enunciated in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819),
however it may have evolved since that decision, requires
at least that the United States be immune from discriminatory treatment by , State which in some manner
interferes with the execution of federal laws. If the
State of Pennsylvania could not impose a nondiscriminatory property tax on property owned by the United
States, United States v. Allegheny County, 322 U. S. 174
(1944), a fortiori, the State of Louisiana may not enforce
Act 315 against the property of the United States involved in this case. I therefore concur in the judgment
of the Court.
