UNITED STATES v. STATE TAX COMMISSION
OF, MISSISSIPPI wr A.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI

No. 72-350.

Argued March 19, 1973-Decided June 4, 1973

The United States brought this action contesting the validity of
appellee Tax Commission's regulation requiring out-of-state liquor
distillers and suppliers to collect and remit to the Commission
a wholesale markup -on liquor sold to military officers' clubs and
other nonappropriated fund 'activities located on bases within
Mississippi, over two of which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction, and, the remaining two of which concurrent
jurisdiction. Relying on the Twenty-first Amendment, the District
C6urt upheld the regulation. Held:
1.The Twenty-first Amendment does not empoiver a State to
tax or otherwise regulate the importation of distilled spirits into
a territory'over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction, Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U.'S. 518,
regardless of whether some of the liquor may have been consumed off base. Pp. 369-378.
2. Whether the markup can be viewed as a sales tax to whose
imposition in the context 6f the two exclusive-jurisdiction bases
the United States has consented under the Brick Act, and whether,
in -any event, the markup unconstitutionally taxes federal instrumentalities, and violates the Supremacy Clause as conflicting with
federal procurement regulations and policy,. are issues that the
District Court did not reach and should consider initially on
remand. Pp. 378-381.

Mr. ,uSTIC MARsHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court..
In this case we are called upon to review the judgment
of the District Court for the Southern Distric ,of Mississippi that the State of Mississippi may require outof-state .liquor distillers and suppliers to collecta d
rerhit to the State a wholesale markup on liquor sola
to officers' clubs, ship's stores, and post exchanges located
on various military ,bases over which the United States
exercises eiiher exclusive jurisdiction or jurisdiction concurrent with the State.
Prior to 1966, the State of Mississippi prohibited the
sale or possession of alcoholic beverages within its borders. In that- year, Mississippi passed ,a local option
alcoholic beverage control law subject to the requirement
that the State Tax Commission be the sole importer and
wholesaler of alcoholic beverages distributed within the
State --The Tax Commission was given exclusive authority to act as wholesale distributor in the sale of alcoholic
beverages to licensed retailers within the State "including, at the discretion of the Commission, any retail distributors operaiimg within any military post . . within
the boundaries of the State, . .. exercising such control
over the distribution of alcoholic beverages as [seemsright and proper in keeping with, the provisions and purposes of this act." 2 In conjunction with these transactions with retailers, the Commission was directed to

Opinion of the Court

"add to the cost of all alcoholic beverages such ...

markups as in its discretion will be adequate to cover
the cost of operation of the State wholesale liquor business, yield a reasonable profit, and be competitive with
liquor prices in neighboring states." 3 Under the authority granted to it by the Act, the Tax Commission promulgated Regulation25 1 which gives military post exchanges,
ship's stores, and officers' clubs the option of purchasing
liquor either from the Commission or directly from the
distiller. However, insofar as purchases are made directly from the distillers by such military facilities, the
regulation requires the distiller to collect and remit to
the Tax Commission the latter's "usual wholesale
markup." During the period involved in this case, the
Tax Commission's wholesale inarkup was 17% on distilled spirits and 20% on wine.

Four United States military bases -are located in the
State of Mississippi-Keesler Air Force Base, the Naval

Construction Battalion Center, Columbus Air Force Base,
and Meridian Naval Air Station. Prior to 1966, the officers' clubs, the-post exchanges, and the ship's store4L

The Regulation, which was originally numbered 22, reads as
follows:
"Post exchanges, ship stores, and officers' clubs located on militaryxeservations and operated by military personnel (including those
operated by the National Guard) shall have the option of ordering
alcoholic beverages direct from the distiller or from the Alcoholic
Beverage Control Division of the State Tax Commission. In the
event an order is placed by such organization directly with a distiller, a coy of such order. shall be immediately mailed to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of' the State Tax Commission.
"All orders of such organizations shall bear the usual wholesale
markup in price but shall be-exempt from all state taxes. The price
of such beverages shall be paid by such organizations directly to
the distiller, whiqch shall in turn remit the wholesale markup to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the State Tax Commission
monthly covering shipments made for the previous month."

which are run with funds derived from operations rather
than from funds appropriated by the United States-on
these four bases had purchased liquor fromdistillers and
suppliers located outside the State of Mississipl5i. Following the passage of the Mississippi local option law,
these nonappropriated fund actiVities elected to continue
the practice of purchasing liquor supplies outside the
State rather than to purchase liquor from the Commission.
Efforts were made by nrilitary authorities to convince the
Commission not to collect the markup on out-pf-state
liquor purchases by nonappropnated fund activities, but
these efforts failed, and the Commission compelled out-ofstate distillers and suppliers to collect and iemit the markup on military sales under threat of criminal prosecution
and of delisting, that is, withdrawal of the privilege of
selling to the Commission for retailing within Mississippi.5
The military authorities sought to pay the markup into an
escrow fund pending judicial determination of the legality
of the markup as applied to military purchases. But the
Commission refused to accept such an arrangement, and
in order to obtain liquor supplies the nonappropriated
fund activities have had to pay the markup to the distillers and suppliers, albeit under protest.6
In November 1969, the United. States brought this
action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against
the continued enforcement of Regulation 25, plus a judgment in the total amount paid to the Commission, through
the suppliers, since the imposition of the m Erkup on military purchases. The complaint Alleged that the United
States has exclusive jurisdiction over Keesler Air Force
Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center, and

Out-of-state suppliers had been paid $648,421.92 under protest
for such nmarkups by July 31, 1971.

rent jurisdiction over Columbus Air Force Base and

Meridian Naval Air Station. The complaint contended that the Regulation was invalid because it constituted an attempt by the State to legislate with respect
to military facilities and territory over which the Congress has exclusive legislative authority;' to impose a
tax on federal instrumentalities and thereby infringe
upon the Federal Government's immunity from state
taxation; 8 and to interfere with federal procurement reg-

ulations and policy established by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to authority granted to him by Congress.9
The complaint also asked that a three-judge court be
convened.
On crosg-motions fcr summary judgment, the District
Court ruled in favor of the Commission, upholding the
validity of the challenged Regulation. 340 F. Supp. 903
(SD Miss. 1972). The District Court agreed that the
United States had exclusive jurisdiction over two of the
four bases and concurrent jurisdiction over the remaining
two. But it concluded that Congress' constitutional
powers over the military forces and over territory belonging to the United States "are diminished by the express
prohibition of the XXI Amendment as to all packaged
liquor transactions which (1) are made on exclusively
federal enclaves but without restriction upon use and
consumption of such liquors outside the-base, or (2) take
place on military installations over which the state and
federal government exercise concurrent jurisdiction."
Id., at 904. In light of this conclusion the District Court
found it unnecessary to consider the import of the procurement regulations issued by the Secretary of Defense.
Nor did it discuss the contention that the markup con,See U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, es. 14 and 17, Art. IV, §3.

stituted an impermissible tax upon federal instrumentalities. On appeal by the United States, we noted probable jurisdiction, 409 U. S. 1005 (1972).11 For the reasons which follow, we now hold that the District Court
erred in concluding that the Twenty-first Amendment
provides the State with sufficient authority over liquor
transactions to support the application of the Regulation
to the two bases over which the United States exercises
exclusive jurisdiction,", and we vacate and remand the
case to the District Court for consideration oft further
arguments, relevant to the nonappropriated fund activities on all four-bases, that it did not reach.
XoSee Paul v. United States, 371 U. S. 245, 249-250 (1963).
'1 In a special concurring opinion, Judge Cox added that recoupment of the sums paid under the markup was also barred because,
in his view, the paymentsthad been voluntarily made by the nonappropriated fund activities. 340 F. Supp., at 909. It is true that
where voluntary payment is knowingly made pursuant to an illegal
demand, recovery of that payment may be denied. See, e. g.,
United States v. New York & Cuba Mail S. S. Co., 200 U. S. 488,
493-494 (1906); Little v. Bowers, 134'U. S. 547, 554 (1890); Railroad Co. v. Commissioners, 98 U. S. 541, 543-544 (1879). But no
such voluntary paymenta are involved here. The Tax Commission
refused to accept an escrow arrangement and it made clear to the
out-of-state suppliers that. severe sanctions would be applied to
anyone who failed to charge the markup and to remit the resulting
funds to if. Thus, the Tax Commission gave the nonappropriated
fund activities no choice except to pay the markup--eithef to itself
or to the out-of-state suppliers-in order to obtain liquor supplies
or else to cease dispensing alcoholic beverages altogether-that is,
to discontinue an entire line of business. Obviously, this was no
choice at all. The payments of the markup were obtained only by
coercion; they were paid under protest; and thus they hardly can be said to have been voluntary. See, e. g., Ward v. Board of
County Comm'rs of Love County, 253 U,S.17, 23 (1920); Atchison,
T. & S. F. R. Co. v. O'Connor, 223 U. S.280, 286-287 (1912);

Opiu.on f the Court

A. With respect to the two bases over which it claims
exclusive jurisdiction, Keesler Air Force Base and the
Naval Construction Battalion Center, the Government
places principal reliance upon Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, of the
Constitution. That clause empowers Congress to "exercise exclusive Legislation . ... over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State
in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts,
Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful
Buildings."
In Pacific Coast Dairy, Inc. v. Dept. of Agriculture,
318 U. S. 285 (1943), the Court considered that clause
sufficient to render ineffecitive an attempt by the State
of California to fix the prices at which California milk
producers could sell milk to military authorities at Moffett
Field, over which the United States exercised exclusive
jurisdiction.
"When the federal government acquired the tract
[upon which Moffett Field was located], local law
not inconsistent with federal policy remained in
force until altered by national legislation. The state
statute involved was adopted long after the transfe
of sovereignty and was without force in the eniclave
It follows that contracts to sell and sales 'consummated within the enclave cannot be regulated by'the
California law. To hold otherwise would be to
affirm that California may ignore the Constitutional provision that 'This Constitution, and the
laws of the United States which shall be made in
Pursuance thereof; . .. shall be the supreme Law
of the Land; . .' It would be a denial of the
federal power 'to exercise exclusive Legislation. As
respects such federal territory Congress has the corn-

bined powers of a general and. a state government."
Id., at 294 (footnotes omitted).
The view of Art. I, § 8, cI. 17, expressed in Pacific Coast
Dairy was reaffirmed in Paul v. United tates, 371 U. S.
245, 263-270 (1963). There the Court was confronted
with another attempt by California to enforce minimum
wholesale price regulations on sales of milk to the United
States at three other military installations located within
the State. A portion of the milk was purchased-as are
the liquor supplies here at issue-with nonappropriated
funds for use at officers' clubs and for resale at post exchanges. As to these nonappropriated fund purchases,
the Court found it necessary to remand the case to determine whether the state regulatory scheme predated
the transfer of sovereignty over any of the particular bases
to the United States,"2 and, even if not, whether the
United States in fact exercised exclusive jurisdiction over
the areas in which purchases and sales of milk were made.
But in so doing the Court emphasized, that "[tihe cases
make clear that the grant of 'exclusive' legislative power
to Congress over enclaves that meet the requirements of
Art'. I, § 8, cl. 17, by its own weight, bars state regulation
without specific congressional action." Id., at 263.
Were it not for the fact that we deal here with a atite'
1 "The Constitution does not command-that every vestige of the
laws of the former sovereignty must vanish. On the contrary its
language has long been interpreted so as to permit the continuance
until abrogated of. those rules eiisting at the time of the surrender
of sovereignty which govern the rights of the occupants of the territory transferred. This assures that no area however small will be
without a developed legal system for private rights." James Stewart & Go. v. Sadrakuta, 309 U. S. 04, 99--100 (1940).

attempt to regulate and derive income from wholesale
transactions in lquor-a fact which raises further cuestions as to the extent of -the power conferred upon
the States under the Twenty-first Amendment and the
possibility of consent by the United States to state
taxation-Pacific Coast Dairy and Paul would seem to
be sufficient'to dispose of this case insofar as Keesler Air
Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center
are concerned. See also James v. Dravo ContrastingCo:,
302 U. S. 134, i40 (1937); Standard Oil Co. v. California,
291 U. S.242 (1934). The transactions here at issue are
strictly between the United States and outof-state distillers and suppliers. The goods are ordered by the officers' clubs and other nonappropriaed fund activities and
then delivered within the military bases over which the
United States claims exclusive jurisdiction. Thus, with
respect to the initial al. and delivery of the liquor Dy the
suppliers to military facilities located in exclusively federal enclaves, nothing occurs within the State that gives it
jurisdiction to regulate the ini.al wholesale transaction.1 3

361, 382-383 (1964); Penn Dairies,Inc. v. Milk Control
Comm'n, 318 U. S.261 (1943).
There can be no question that the tracts of land upon
which Keesler Air. Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center are located were "purchased by the
Conseilt of the Legislature" of Mississippi within the
meaning of Art. I, § 8, el. 17. Despite its ultimate resolution of the case, the District Court acknowledged that
the United States had acquired exclusive jurisdiction over
these two bases. 340 F. Supp., at 904,906. The Federal
Government acquired the relevant lands by condemnation

The State's power to regulate transportation of alcoholic beverages through its territory to the bases or from the bases back into
its jurisdiction is, however, a differet question, see itifra,at 377-378.

"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the obtaining of exclusive jurisdiction in the United States over lands or interests
therein which have been or shall hereafter be acquired by it shall
not be required; but the head or other authorized officer of any

Accordingly, unless the fact that in -this case the State
has attempted to derive revenue from private wholesale
liquor transactions provides a decisive distinction, our
prior cases make it clear that the Tax Commission could
not attach its markup to the sale and delivery of liquor
by out-of-state suppliers to nonappropriated fund activities within Keesler Air Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center.
B. But the Tax Commission contends-as the District
Court held-that the application of the markup regulation to the two bases over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction is sustainable on the basis of
the broad regulatory authority conferred upon the States
by the Twenty-first Amendment. The second section of
the Twenty-first Amendment provides:
"The transportation or importation into any State,
Territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, ik violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited."
n Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S.
518 (1938), a concessionaire ;vhich operated hotels, camps,
may deem desirable and indicate acceptance of such jurisdiction on
behalf of the United States by filing a notice of such acceptance with
the Governor of such State or in such other manner as may be prescribed by the laws of the State where such lands are situated.
Unless and until the United States 'has accepted jurisdiction over
lands hereafter to be acquired as aforesaid, it shall be conclusively
presumed that no such jurisdiction has been accepted."
"8 See Stipulation, App. 28-29, and Ex. 1-7.
Since the challenged regulation first became effective in 1966, long
after the United States had acquired jurisdiction over the bases,
there is no question here as to the application within a federal enclave of a state law that predates the trasfer of sovereign authority,'

-and stores in Yosemite National Park, under a contract
with the Secretary of the Interior, sought to elijoin the
efforts of 'California authorities to enforce the State's
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act within the limits of the
Park. The state liquor law would have required the
concessionaire to apply for permits for the importation
and. sale of liquor and to pay related taxes and fees. The
Court found that the State had ceded to the UnitedStates, and that the United States had accepted, exclusive jurisdiction over Yosemite National Park, except insofar as the State had expresisy reserved the right to tax
persons and corporations within the Park. Id., at 527530. In light of this determination, the Court held that
"[a]s there is no reservation of the right to control the
sale or use of alcoholic beverages, such regulatory provisions as are found in the Act"-namely, the provisions
concerning importation and sales permits--"are unen-.
forceable in the Park." Id., at 530. In'support of its
attempt to apply the permit provisions within the Park,
the State placed specific reliance upon the regulatory
authority conferred upon it by-'§ 2 of the Twenty-fist
Amendment. But the Court rejected this argument,
agreeing instead with the District Court's conclusion "fthat
though the Amendment may have increased 'the state's
power to 'deal with the problem... t[of liquor impor
tation], it did not increhse its jurisdiction.f" Id., at 538..
The Court then went on to state:
"As territorial jurisdiction over the Park was in
the United States, the State could not legislate for
the area merely on account of the XXI Amendment.
There was no transportation into California 'for delivery or use therein.' The delivery and use is in
the Park, and under a distinct sovereignty. Where
exclusive jurisdiction is in the United States, without
power in the State to regulate -alcoholic beverages,

UNITED STATES v. MISSISSIPPI TAX COMM'N
363

'375

Opinion of the Court

the XXI Amendment is not applicable." Ibid.
(Footnotes omitted.)
It i's
true, as the Tax Commission argues, that the Court
did sustain the application of the tax provisions of the
state liquor law within the Park. But this aspect of the
decision was bottomed specifically on the State's reservation of taxing authority in its cession of lands to the
United States, id., at 532, 536.
Collin would seem to compel the conclusion that absent an appropriate express reservation-which is lacking
here-the Twenty-first Amendment confers no power on a
State to regulate-whether by licensing, taxation, or
otherwise--the importation of distilled spirits into territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction. See also Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co.,
321 U. S. 383 (1944). Certainly, the Amendment was
intended' to free the State of "traditional Commerce
'Clause limitations when it restricts the importation of
intoxicants destined for use, distribution, or consumption,
within its borders." Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage
Liquor Corp., 377 U. S.324, 330 (1964). See also Joseph
E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. S.35, 42.
(1966). But the Government contends that here, as in
Collins, there was no "transportation'or importation [of
liquor] into [the] State . . for delivery or use therein"
within the meaning of the second section and therefore,
the Twenty-first Amendment does not assist the Tax
Commi'sion's case. We agree.--.
The District Court acknowledged that Reesler Air
Force Base and the Naval Construction Battalion Center
"are to Mfississippi as the territory of one of her sister
states or a foreign land. They constitute federal islands
which no Ibnger constitute any part of Mississippi nor
function under its control." -340 F. Supp., at 906. And
it.recognized that in lightof Collins, "[t]he importation

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

Opinion of the Court

412 U. S.

of p'roperty onto these bases for use thereon would clearly
be outside the ambit of the XXI Amendment." Id,
at 906-907. But the court considered Collins to be limited strictly to the situation in which delivery and use of
the liquor was restricted to the exclusive enclave, whereas'
in this case "[tihe undisputed facts show that it was
acquired for the purpose of~being sold to individuals for
their use and consumption either on the base or in the
surrounding state." Id., at 907. Such off-base con~umption was sufficient, in the District Court's viewrto subject'the transactions between the out-of-state suppliers,
and the nonappropriated fund activities to the regulatory
authority granted tojMississippi under the Twenty-first
Amendment. We think, however, that the District Court
unjustifiably narrowed the decision in Collins.
There is, in fact, no indication in Collins that the liquor'
purchased from the 'concessionaire's facilities in the Park
was alway consumed within the limits of the Park. To
the contrary, the complaint in that case specifically stated
that the liquor imported for sale in the park facilities
was sold "for consumption on or off the premises "where
sola." " Hence, it is just as reasonable to assume that
some of the liquor sold in the Park was consumed. outside its limits in the State of California as it is to assume
that some of the liquor sold"on these two bases was ultimately consumed in the State' of Mississippi2 0 The
'9 Transcript of Record, No. 870, 0. T. 1937, p. 3.
20In fact,
the record in this case contains no express indication as
to the extent to which packaged liquor purchased from the nonappropriated fund activities is consumed outside the jurisdiction of the
two bases. The District Court inferred off-base consumption from
the facts that "numerous classes of non miltary pesons are authorized, to make purchases; and every selling facility exacts a promise
from each purchaser that he will bey the laws of the state as to
such of the liquor bought as may lie taken off of the installation." 340
F. Supp., at 905. By a parity of reasoning the likelihood that some
of the liquor purchased from stores located in Yosemite National

r

UNITED STATES v. MISSISSIPPI TAX COMM'N

Opinion of the Court

Collins Court, in rejecting California's reliance upon the
Twenty-first Amendment, pointed, to be sure, to the fact
that "delivery and use" of the liquor was "in the Park,"
304 U. S., at 538. But, considered in the context of the
case, the Court's reference clearly was to the transaction
between the out-of-state suppliers and the park concessionaire. It was that transaction which California sought
to regulate, and insofar as that transaction was concerned,
the delivery and use--that is, the delivery, storage, and
sale-of the liquor occurred exclusively within the Park.
The particular transactions at issue in this case between
out-of-state supplers and the military facilities stand on
no different footing, and thus, given that the State has
retained only the right, to serve process on the two bases,
Collins is dispositive of the Commission's effort to invoke
the State's authority under the. second section of the
Twenty-first Amendment'to impose its markup on these
transactions.
This is not to suggest that the State is without authority either to regulate liquor shipments destined for the
bases while such shipments are passing through Mississippi or to regulate the transportation of liquor off the
bases and into ississippi for consumption there. Thus,
while it may be true that the mere "shipment [of liquor]
through a state is not transportation or importation into
the state within the meaning of the [Twenty-first]
Amendment," Carter v. Virginia, 321 U. S. 131, 137
(1944), a State may, in the absence of conflicting federal
regulation, properly exercise its police powers to regulate
and control such shipments during their passage through
its territory insofar as necessary to prevent the "unlawful
diversion" of liquor "into the internal commerce of the
State," see Hostetter v. Idlewid Bon Voyage Liquor

-And the State, of course, remains free to regulate or
restrict, under § 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment, the
transportation off the two bases of liquor that has been
purchased and is in fact"destined for use, distribution,
or consumption" within its borders, see JosephE.Seagram
& Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. 5;, at 42; see also CaZifornia v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109, 114 (1972).
But there is no indication here that the markup is an
effort to deal with problems of diversion of liquor from
out-of-state shipments destined for one of the two bases.
Nor need we now decide the precise, parameters of the
State's authority to regulate efforts to import liquor from
the exclusively federal enclaves, since that question is
not before us. For our purposes here, it suffices to note
that any legitimate state interest in regulating the importation into Mississippi -of- liquor purchased on the
bases by .individuals cannot effect an extepsion of the
State's territorial jurisdiction so as to permit it to regulate the distinct transactions between the 'suppliers and
the nonappropriated fund activities that involve only
the importation of liquor into the federal enclaves which
"are to Mississippi as the territory of one of her sister
states or a foreign land," 340 F. Supp., at 906. To conclude otherwise would be *to give an unintended scope
to a provision designed only to augment the powers of
the States to regulate .the importation of 'liquor destined
for use, distribution, or consumption in its own territory,
not to "'increase its jurisdiction,"' Collins v. Yosemite
Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S., at 538.

that the markup might properly be viewed as.a sales-tax

Opinion of the Court

54 Stat. 1059, now 4 U, S. C. §§ 105-110.
of that, Act provides in part:

Section 105 (a)

"No person shall be relieved from liability'for'payment of, collection of, or accounting for any sales
or use tax levied by any State, or by any duly constituted taxing authority therein, having jurisdiction
to levy such a tax, on the ground that the sale or
use, with respect to which such tax is levied, occurred
in whole or in part within a Federal Area...

4 U. S. C. § 105 (a).
However, § 107 (a) of the Act spells . out certain exceptions to the consent provision contained in § 105 (A).
Specifically,
107 (a) states that § 105 .(a) "shall not
be deemed to authorize the levy or collection of any tax
'on or from the United States or any instrumentality
thereof ... ." Whether the markup, should be treated
-as a tax on sales occurring within a federal area within
the meaning of § 105 (a), see also 4 U. S. C. -§ 110 (b),
and, if so, whether the exception contained in § 1.07 (a)
nevertheless serves to remove the' markup from the
consent provision for purposes of the' two exclMsively federal enclaves are issues which the record
revedls were never considered, much less decided, by the'
District Court. Having found that the District Court
erred in the basis on which it did dispose of this case,
we think that thes6 additional issues are appropriately
left for determination by that court in the first instance
on remand.

The two bases over which the United States claims
to exercise jurisdiction concurrent with the State-Columbus Air Force Base 'and Meridian Naval Air Stationpresent somewhat different problems. Since the United
States has not acquired exclusive 'jurisdiction over the
land upon which these basea are located, the Government

is unable to rest its claims for immunity from the markup
with respect to purchases of liquor for the nonappropriated fund activities of these bases on Art. I, § 8, cl. 17.
Rather, it bases its argument on the theories that the
markup either is an unconstitutionial tax upon instrumentalities of the United States 2 or is invalid under
the Supremacy Clause because it' conflicts with federal
procurement regulations and policy.22 The District Court
specifically found it unnecessary to reach the Government's argument under the Supremacy Clause, and implicitly declined to reach the Government's argument concerning taxation of United States, instrumentalities.
Instead, having concluded that, despite Art. I, § 8, cl. 17,
the Twenty-first Amendment permitted the Tax Commission to apply the markup to out-of-state purchases
destined for nonappropriated fund activities on the two
bases over which the United States exercises exclusive
jurisdiction, the District Court simply reasoned that
"[a] fortiori, the liquor dales made, on the two bases over
which the federal and state governments exercise concurrent jurisdiction-Meridian and Columbus-are similarly
subject to Mississippi law." 340 F. Supp., at 907.
The District Court's rationale for adopting this view
is not entirely clear. Certainly it was correct when it further observed that "as to the concurrent jurisdiction bases,
the liquoi sales transactions oc1urred within the jurisdiction of the State of Mississippi, even where the consumption or other use of the liquor was consummated
within the territorial confines of the base." Ibid. But
this serves only to dispose of any question under Art. I,
§ 8, cl. 17. As already'noted, however, the Government
does not purport to rest its case with respect to transac21

tions involving the two bases over which it exercises only
concurrent jurisdiction upon that clause. In any'event,
we have now concluded that the District Court erred in
ruling that the Twenty-first Amendment empowered the
State Tax Commission to apply the markup to transactions between out-of-state distillers and nonappropriated
fund activities located on the two exclusively federal
enclaves. Our conclusion eliminates the essential premise of the District Court's decision concerning the two
concurrent jurisdiction bases. While the arguments upon
which the Government does rely with respect to the purchase of liquor degtined for those two' bases present, to be
sure, only questions of law which we might now decide,
we believe it would be useful to have the views of the
District Court on these additional arguments, and we
therefore remand the case to the District Court to allow
it to consider initially the' Government's instrumentality
and Supremacy Clause arguments. Cf. Lewis v. Martin,
397'U. S. 552, 560 (1970); FCC v. WJR, 337 U. S. 265,

the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent

This is an amazing decision doing irreparable harm to
the cause of States' rights under the Twenty-first Amendment. That Amendment gives the States pervasive control over the "transportation . . into [the] State. ' .
for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation" of its laws. The liquors cannot, reach these federal enclaves unless they are transported into or across
the State and' they are obviously 'delivered and used
within Mississippi.

Two of the posts are inland enclaves within the State.
Two are on Mississippi's coastline. But to reach the
latter by water a vessel must enter Mississippi's territorial waters. As we, held in Skdriotea v. Florida, 313
U. S. .69, the territorial waters are part of the domain
over which the coastal State has sovereignty. These
shipments therefore constitute "transportation or importation into" Mississip,pi for "delivery . . . therein of
intoxidating liquors" within the meaning of the Twenty-,
first Amendment. The power of the State to bar the
transportation of liquor into the State certainly includes
the power to manage its dtistribution within the State.
Mississippi has done no more than that. So it seems
clear to me that this is a classic example of .the exercise
of basic States' rights under the Twenty-first Amendment.
Mississippi in her regulation of alcoholic beverages is
a so-called monopoly State,' like 17 other States. Some
of these monopoly States make -themselves the exclusive
wholesaler 2 of liquor and wine and exclusive retailer as
well. Mississippi only makbs itself the exclusive wholesaler. The sales involved in this litigation are wholesale
sales to clubs of members of the Armed Services on four
federal bases in Mississippi, over twobf which Mississippi
and the United States have concurrent jurisdiction, the
United States having exclusive jurisdiction over the other
two.
. Under Mississippi law these" post exchanges and other
facilities (hereafter post exchanges) may order liquor
direct from the distiller or from the state commission. The Mississippi regulation provides, "All orders
of such" organizations shall bear the usual wholesale
Miss. Code Ann. § 10265-01 et seq. (Supp. 1972).
2Wholesaler is defined as "any person, other than a manufacturer,
engaged' in distributing or selling any alcoholic beverage at whole-'
sale for delivery within or without this State when such sale is for
the purpose of resale by the purchaser." Id., § 10265-05 (g).

markup 3 in price but shall be exempt from all state
taxes." The wholesale markup on distilled spirits is 17%o
and on wine, 20%. If 'the purshase is made from the
distiller, it remits the wholesale markup to the State.
A distiller who fails or refuses to observe these conditions is deprived of the benefits of this state law and may
be prosecuted.
This suit brought before a three-judge" district court
was to collect the amount of the markups paid by the
post exchanges and to enjoin the enforcement of the
Mississippi regulation against distillers br suppliers doing
business with the post exchanges on the terms of Mississippi law. The three-judge District Court, relying on
the Twenty-first Amendment, gave appellees a summary judgment, 340 F. Supp. 903. Its judgment should
be affirmed.
The four federal enclaves involved in this dispuite are
in theStatie of Mississippi. The spirits Are made out
of State and delivered to the post exchanges within the
State. The question is whether the terms of the Twentyfirst Amendment are met, that is to say, whether there
is liansportation . . . minto . . . [the] State . . . for
delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors."
The spirits are"not all consumed on or at the post
exchanges. Rather, they are resold to members of the.
Armed Services, to retired members and the faniilie" 6f
members; and some of the spirits are consumed in Mississippi and outside the federal enclav es by guests of

members and retirees and their families. As the District
Court said, the spirits are not brought into the federal
enclaves for sole use there. The spirits are resold to
individuals for their use or consumption either on the
federal enclave or in the surrounding state area.
Private retailers in Mississippi pay the State a tax of
$2.50 a gallon on distilled spirits. The Post Exchanges
pay no state tax on their resales; and it is stipulated that
these post exchanges each make a profit.
Section 6 of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended in 1951, authorizes the Secretary of
Defense to make regulations "governing the sale, consumption, possession of or traffic -in . . . intoxicating
liquors to or by members" of the Armed Forces "at or
near any camp, station, post, or other place primarily occupied by [them]." 50 U. S. C. App. § 473. And it
makes criminal, knowing violations of such regulations.
Department of Defense Directive 1330.15 issued May 4,
1964, and amended June.9, 1966, provides that "the purchase of ill alcoholic beverages for resale at any camp,
post, station, base or other place primarily occupied by
members of the Armed Forces within the United States
shall be in such a manner and -under such conditions as
shall obtain for the Government-ne most advantageous
contract, price and other factors considered." The Act
and the Department of Defense regulation do not on
their face purport to override or displace state price control of liquor. It is said, however, that that is immaterial.
The Solicitor General relies on Art. I, § 8, cl. 17, of the
Constitution, which empowers Congress to "exercise exclusive Legislation ... over all Places purchased by the
Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the
Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings." This
provision, it is said, bars state price regulations as respects sales to post exchanges on the two federal enclaves

over which the United States has exclusive jurisdiction
even in absence of a conflicting federal statute or regulation. Reliance is placed on Paul v. United States, 371
V. S. 245, 263-268. The Paul case did not involve the
Twenty-first Amendment. There post exchanges resold
, milk and California provided minimum wholesale price
regulations; and we held that, Art. I,§.8, cl. 17, 'by its
own weight, bars state regulation without 'specific congressional action." Id., at 263.
The Twenty-first Amendment and Art. I, § 8, cl. 17,
are parts of the same Constitution. In Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U. S.324, we held that
while the Twenty-first Amendment gave the States control wfiere otherwise the Commerce Clause would be a bar
to its action (id., at 330), the Twenty-first Amendment
did not give a State the power to prohibit the passage of
liquor through its territory for delivery to consumers in
foreign countries. Congress had enacted a law governing
traffic in liquor to foreign nations; and that aspect of the
Commerce Clause gave Congress exclusive authority over
foreign trade. Hence it is argued'here that the power
of Congrss to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over a federal enclave pre-empts state power. But all that we have
here is -'transportation" into a State, not beyond it.
Collins v. Yosemite Park & Curry Co., 304 U. S. 518,
held as respects a state regulatoryregime of alcoholic beverages within Yosemite National Park in California that
the Twenty-first Amendment gave the State no power to
supervise liquor transactions within the federal enclave.
The Court said:
"As territorial jurisdiction over the Park was in
the United -States, the State could not legislate for
the area merely on account of the XXI Amendment.
There was no transportation into California 'for
delivery or use therein.' The delivery and use is

in the Park, and under a distinct sovereignty. Where
exclusive jurisdiction is in the United States, vithout
power in the State to regulate alcoholic beverages,
the XXI Amendment is not applicable." Id., at
538.
That observation was apt, for California undertook to
assert a regulatory authority within the park. The Solicitor General presses for an application of Collins to the
present.post exchanges.- 'Yet Mississippi asserts no regulatory power over these military bases or over the dispensing, of liquor by- thd post exchanges. Mississippi
only collects a tax from out-of-state distillers and suppliers who, ship liquor to the post exchanges. Those
shipments, as noted, must enter Mississippi to reach the
military bases.
Moreover, Mississippi Asserts no authority to collect
the tax from the Federal Government or its instrumentalities, the post exchanges. The legal incidence of the
so-called sales tax is on the distributor only. The economic incidence is, of course, on the post exchanges. But
it has long been held that there is no constitutional barrier to that result.
That raises the other phase of the case which should be
decided here, as it is covered by omr decisions and requires
no additional factfindings for its resolution.
At least since Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1,
state taxes have been upheld on those doing business'
with the Federal Government even as respects cost-plus
contracts where the terms of the contract forced their
payment out of the federal treasury.5 The principle of

Federal Government's right to levy taxes on :New York State's sale
of mineral waters, the Court stated, "In the older cases, the emphasis
was on immunity from taxation. The whole tendency of recent
cases reveals a shift in emphasis to" that of limitation upon immunity. They also indicate an awareness of the limited role of

UNITED STATES v.- MISSISSIPPI TAX COMM'N
363

DoWLzs, J., dissenting

King & Boozer permits no exception for distillers who
make wholesale transactions with post exchanges, as the
legal inciaence of the tax is on the distillers, not on the
courts in assessing the relative weight of the factors upon which
immunity is based." Id., at 5,81.
That trend continued in Esso Standard Oil Co., v. Evans, 345
U. S._495, where the Court upheld the validity of a state privilege
tax on Esso, occasioned by its storage of gasoline owned by the
United States, even though it was shown that the United States
had contractually obligated itself to reimburse the contractor for
any state tax liability incurred. The Court distinguished those cases
which had held that there could'be no state tax on federally owned
property by indicating that in Esso the tax was on the privilege
of storing Government property.
Uzited States v. City of Detroit,355 U. S. 466, and United States v.
Muskegon, 355 U. S. 484, concerned the aliplication of a 1953 Michi.gan statute providing that when tax-exempt real property is used
by a private person in a business conducted for profit the private
person is subj~et to taxation to the same extent as if he were the
owner of the property. Both cases involved Government contractorsr
occipying, defenke plants, one under a lease, and the other under
a permit which could be teriiiinated at will. The Court upheld the
imposition of .the tax, saying the constitutional immunity of the
Federal Government from state taxation was not violated and that
the state statute was not discriminatory nor was' the statute dacriminatorily administered. This result was reached notwithstanding 'the fact that theFederal Government had for years reimbursed
its contractors for the costs of possessory interest taxes.'
In City of Detroit v. Murray Corp., 355 U. S. 489, the Court upheld
a tax imposed on Murray, an Air Force subcontractori.on the basis of
work in process and inventoey, title to which was in the Federal
Government on the tax day. The Court found no constitutional
impediment to permitting a potsessory-interest tax on Governmentowned personal ,property. Unlike the real property situation, the
Michigan statute did not specifically authorize such tax, but it
was imposed .pursuant to the usual personal property tax statute,
•levying the tax 'on the property. In commenting on the disparity
between the statutes, the Court stated, "It is true that the particular
Michigan taxing statutes involved here do not expressly state that the
person in possession is taxed 'for the privilege of using or possessing'
personal property, but to strike down a tax on the possessor because
of such a verbal omission would only prove a victory for empty -

post exchanges. Moreover, the Buck Act, 54 Stat. 1059,
now 4 U. S. C. § 105 et seq., authorizes the applidtion of
state sales and use taxes to all post exchange purchases
where "the sale or use, with respect to which such tax is
levied, occurred in whole or in part within a Federal area."
The Buck Act exempts from such taxes, sales, purchases,
storage, or use: of personal property sold by the United
States or any instrumentality thereof to "any authorized
'purchaser" (§ 107), 'who is defined as one permitted to
purchase at commissaries, ship's stores, post exchanges,
and the like, by regulations of the departmental Secretary.
It also does not authorize "the levy or. collection of any
tax on or from the United States or any instrumentality
thereof." 4 U. S. C. § 107 (a).
1 ,The markup which the State requires wholesalers of
liquor to make is in its worst light a sales tax. There is
no "levy or collection" by the State from a post exchange
in any, technical, legal sense. As noted, the economic
but not the legal incidence of-the tax is in the post exchanges. The post exchange is merely paying indirectly
the cost of doing business' in the manner in- which
King'& Boozer held that there was no constitutional
immunity from state taxation.
That alone is sufficient to distinguish the present case
from Paul v. United States, 371 U. S. 245, where state
minimum price regulations were held to be inoperative as
applied to purchases of milk by federal instrumentalities,
such as post exchanges. Paul in other words involved no
tax at all. The levy of Mississippi on wholesalers is, as
noted, a sum designed to cover the cost to the State of
operating the wholesale liquor business, yield a reasonable profit, and be competitive, with liquor prices in.

neighboring States.

It is plainly, therefore, a tax on

-sales and in my view authorized by Congress under the
Buck Act. The Solicitor General concedes in his brief
that the Mississippi regulation is meant only "to raise
revenue." By reas6n of the Buck Act it matters not,
therefore, that the p6st exchanges, as held in Paul, are
fede-al instrumentalities. Here, as in King & Boozer,
we deal only with the "economic" burden of the local
tax, its legal incidence being solely on the distributor.
FirstAgr*iultural NationalBank v. State Tax Comm'n,
392 U. S. 339, is inapposite. In that case Congress had
specifically provided four ways in which the States could
tax national banks, apart from taxes on their real estate.
Id., at 341-342.- Efforts to allow broader taxation were
defeated in Congress. Because of that history, we read
the Massachusetts sales tax closely and noting that the
tax was ""recoverable at law'" from the national bank,
id., at 347, held that it transcended the congressional
waiver of immunity.
That case does not control here for two reasons.
First, the legal incidence of the present tax is not in
the post exchanges, only the economic incidence.
Second, the Massachusetts sales tax had no relation
to the Twenty-first Amendment. The present case involves "transportation or importation" of liquor into the
State of Mississippi over which the State has plenary
control. The State, having the power to bar liquor
completely from Mississippi, can admit ii on such terms
and conditions as she chooses. If she sought .to levy
a tax on the post exchanges a different issue would
arise.' But there is no federal imniunity against including state costs in federal contracts.
While the Budk Act by § 107 (a) bars a state tax on
federal instrumentalities--which as Paul holds includes
post exchanges-King & Boozer allows a state tax on
those who, like the wholesalers in this case, do business
with the United States. King & Boozer, decided in 1941,

after .the Buck Act, stated the modern version of-the
scope of intergovernmental immunity.0 The prestrnt case
is therefore on all fours with the excise tax imposed by
Florida on milk distributors who in turn sold to federal
enclaves. In referring to the Buck Act we said:
"We think this provision provides ample basis for
Florida to levy a tax measured by the amount of milk
Polar distributes monthly, including milk sold to the
United States for use on federal enclaves in Florida."
Polar Ice Cream & Creamery Co. v. Andrews, 375
U. S. 361, 383.
The judgment, below should be affltmed.
6 Diring the flist third of this century the doctrine of inter,governmental immunity, as it applies to state taxation of allegedly
federal governmental activities, went through a highly expansive
phase. Among the taxes held invalid were the followiiig: sales tax
on articles sold to the Government, Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississppi,
277 U. & 218; income tax on earnings from patents and copyrights,
Long v. Rockwood, 277 U. S.142; income tax on income derived by
lessees of public lands, Gillespie v. Oklahonia,'257 U. S. 501..
At'the same time. however, a number of inroads or qualifications
on the- doctrine were, establishpd. Among the taxes held valid werethe fojlowing: corporatd franchise tax measured by income including
that from Government bonds, Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S.
107; inheritance or estate tax measiured in part by Government bonds,
Plummer v. Co/r,4178 U. S. 115: income tax on capital gain on
resale of Government bonds, Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216;
-income tax on net income of contractors with the Government,
Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514. This trend culminated
in the decisioii of the Court in Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. I.
That trend led a commentator to note, "Today, the tlnited States
conducts much of -its business through a vast number of private
parties. The trend in -the U. S. Supreme Court has been to reject
* immunizing these private parties from non-discriminatory state taxes,
as a matter 'of constitutional law, even though the -United States
bears the economic'brunt of the tax, indirectly in some instances,
by inclusion in price; and more directly in many instances, by reimbursement to the contractor as an item of cost." Roilman,
