LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 83-1961.

Argued March 26, 1985-Decided May 28, 1985

Respondents father and sons, who owned all of the common stock of a lumber business that they operated, offered their stock for sale through brokers. The company's sawmill was subsequently damaged by fire, but
potential purchasers were told that the mill would be rebuilt and modernized. Thereafter, a stock purchase agreement for all of the stock
was executed, and ultimately petitioner company was formed by the purchasers. Respondent father agreed to stay on as a consultant for some
time to help with the daily operations of the mill. After the acquisition
was completed, the mill did not live up to the purchasers' expectations.
Eventually, petitioner sold the mill at a loss and went into receivership.
Petitioner then filed suit in Federal District Court for rescission of the
sale of stock and damages, alleging that respondents had violated the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) and the
antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act).
The court granted summary judgment for respondents, holding that
under the "sale of business" doctrine, the stock could not be considered a
"security" for purposes of the Acts because managerial control of the
business had passed into the hands of the purchasers, who bought 100%
of the stock. The court concluded that the transaction thus was a commercial venture rather than a typical investment. The Court of Appeals
affirmed.
Held: The stock at issue here is a "security" within the definition of
the Acts, United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837,
distinguished, and the "sale of business" doctrine does not apply.
Pp. 685-697.
(a) Section 2(1) of the 1933 Act and ยง 3(a)(10) of the 1934 Act define a
"security" as including "stock" and other listed types of instruments.
Although the fact that instruments bear the label "stock" is not of itself
sufficient to invoke the Acts' coverage, when an instrument is both called
"stock" and bears stock's usual characteristics as identified in Forman,
supra, a purchaser justifiably may assume that the federal securities
laws apply. The stock involved here possesses all of the characteristics
traditionally associated with common stock. Moreover, reading the
securities laws to apply to the sale of stock at issue here comports
with Congress' remedial purpose in enacting the legislation to protect
investors. Pp. 685-688.

(b) When an instrument is labeled "stock" and possesses all of the
traditional characteristics of stock, a court is not required to look to the
economic substance of the transaction to determine whether the stock
is a "security" within the meaning of the Acts. A contrary rule is not
supported by this Court's prior decisions involving unusual instruments
not easily characterized as "securities." Nor were the Acts intended,
as asserted by respondents, to cover only "passive investors" and not
privately negotiated transactions involving the transfer of control to
"entrepreneurs." Pp. 688-692.
(c) An instrument bearing both the name and all of the usual characteristics of stock presents the clearest case for coverage by the plain language of the definition. "Stock" is distinguishable from most if not all
of the other listed categories, and may be viewed as being in a category
by itself for purposes of interpreting the Acts' definition of "security."
Pp. 693-694.
(d) Application of the "sale of business" doctrine depends on whether
control has passed to the purchaser. Even though the transfer of 100%
of a corporation's stock normally transfers control, the purchasers here
had no intention of running the sawmill themselves. Moreover, if the
doctrine were applied here, it would also have to be applied to cases in
which less than 100% of a company's stock was sold, thus inevitably leading to difficult questions of line-drawing. As explained in Gould v.
Ruefenacht, post, p. 701, coverage by the Acts would in most cases be
unknown and unknowable to the parties at the time the stock was sold.
Such uncertainties attending the applicability of the Acts would be intolerable. Pp. 694-697.

JUSTICE POWELL

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents the question whether the sale of all of
the stock of a company is a securities transaction subject to
the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws (the

Acts).

I

Respondents Ivan K. Landreth and his sons owned all of
the outstanding stock of a lumber business they operated in
Tonasket, Washington. The Landreth family offered their
stock for sale through both Washington and out-of-state brokers. Before a purchaser was found, the company's sawmill
was heavily damaged by fire. Despite the fire, the brokers
continued to offer the stock for sale. Potential purchasers
were advised of the damage, but were told that the mill
would be completely rebuilt and modernized.
Samuel Dennis, a Massachusetts tax attorney, received
a letter offering the stock for sale. On the basis of the letter's representations concerning the rebuilding plans, the
predicted productivity of the mill, existing contracts, and expected profits, Dennis became interested in acquiring the
stock. He talked to John Bolten, a former client who had retired to Florida, about joining him in investigating the offer.
After having an audit and an inspection of the mill conducted,
a stock purchase agreement was negotiated, with Dennis the
purchaser of all of the common stock in the lumber company.
Ivan Landreth agreed to stay on as a consultant for some
time to help with the daily operations of the mill. Pursuant
to the terms of the stock purchase agreement, Dennis assigned the stock he purchased to B & D Co., a corporation
formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the lumber company
stock. B & D then merged with the lumber company, formbrief for the Securities and Exchange Commission as amicus curiaeurging

Stephen M. Shapiro and BarbaraA. Reeves filed a brief for Advance
Ross Corp. as amicus curiae urging affirmance.

ing petitioner Landreth Timber Co. Dennis and Bolten then
acquired all of petitioner's Class A stock, representing 85% of
the equity, and six other investors together owned the Class
B stock, representing the remaining 15% of the equity.
After the acquisition was completed, the mill did not live
up to the purchasers' expectations. Rebuilding costs exceeded earlier estimates, and new components turned out to
be incompatible with existing equipment. Eventually, petitioner sold the mill at a loss and went into receivership. Petitioner then filed this suit seeking rescission of the sale of
stock and $2,500,000 in damages, alleging that respondents
had widely offered and then sold their stock without registering it as required by the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U. S. C.
ยง 77a et seq. (1933 Act). Petitioner also alleged that respondents had negligently or intentionally made misrepresentations and had failed to state material facts as to the worth and
prospects of the lumber company, all in violation of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. ยง 78a et seq.
(1934 Act).
Respondents moved for summary judgment on the ground
that the transaction was not covered by the Acts because
under the so-called "sale of business" doctrine, petitioner had
not purchased a "security" within the meaning of those Acts.
The District Court granted respondents' motion and dismissed the complaint for want of federal jurisdiction. It acknowledged that the federal statutes include "stock" as one of
the instruments constituting a "security," and that the stock
at issue possessed all of the characteristics of conventional
stock. Nonetheless, it joined what it termed the "growing
majority" of courts that had held that the federal securities
laws do not apply to the sale of 100% of the stock of a closely
held corporation. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. Relying on
United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837
(1975), and SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., 328 U. S. 293 (1946),
the District Court ruled that the stock could not be considered a "security" unless the purchaser had entered into the

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH

Opinion of the Court

transaction with the anticipation of earning profits derived
from the efforts of others. Finding that managerial control
of the business had passed into the hands of the purchasers,
and thus that the transaction was a commercial venture
rather than a typical investment, the District Court dismissed the complaint.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the District Court's application of the sale of business doctrine. 731 F. 2d 1348 (1984). It agreed that it was
bound by United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman,
supra, and SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., supra, to determine in
every case whether the economic realities of the transaction
indicated that the Acts applied. Because the Courts of Appeals are divided over the applicability of the federal securities laws when a business is sold by the transfer of 100% of
its stock, we granted certiorari. 469 U. S. 1016 (1984). We
now reverse.
II

It is axiomatic that "[t]he starting point in every case
involving construction of a statute is the language itself."
Blue Chip Stamps v. ManorDrug Stores, 421 U. S.723, 756
(1975) (POWELL, J., concurring); accord, Teamsters v. Daniel, 439 U. S.551, 558 (1979). Section 2(1) of the 1933 Act,
48 Stat. 74, as amended and as set forth in 15 U. S. C.
ยง77b(1), defines a "security" as including
"any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust
certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription,
transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust
certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional
undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights,
...or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly
known as a 'security,' or any certificate of interest or
participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, re-

ceipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe
to or purchase, any of the foregoing. '
As we have observed in the past, this definition is quite
broad, Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U. S. 551, 556 (1982),
and includes both instruments whose names alone carry wellsettled meaning, as well as instruments of "more variable
character [that] were necessarily designated by more descriptive terms," such as "investment contract" and "instrument commonly known as a 'security."' SEC v. C. M.
Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U. S. 344, 351 (1943). The face
of the definition shows that "stock" is considered to be a
"security" within the meaning of the Acts. As we observed
in United Housing Foundation,Inc. v. Forman, supra, most
instruments bearing such a traditional title are likely to be
covered by the definition. Id., at 850.
As we also recognized in Forman, the fact that instruments bear the label "stock" is not of itself sufficient to invoke the coverage of the Acts. Rather, we concluded that
we must also determine whether those instruments possess
"some of the significant characteristics typically associated
with" stock, id., at 851, recognizing that when an instrument
is both called "stock" and bears stock's usual characteristics,
"a purchaser justifiably [may] assume that the federal securities laws apply," id., at 850. We identified those characteristics usually associated with common stock as (i) the right
to receive dividends contingent upon an apportionment of
profits; (ii) negotiability; (iii) the ability to be pledged or
hypothecated; (iv) the conferring of voting rights in proportion to the number of shares owned; and (v) the capacity to
appreciate in value.' Id., at 851.
' We have repeatedly ruled that the definitions of "security" in ยง3(a)(10)
of the 1934 Act and ยง2(1) of the 1933 Act are virtually identical and will
be treated as such in our decisions dealing with the scope of the term.
Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455 U. S. 551, 555, n. 3 (1982); United Housing
Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837, 847, n. 12 (1975).
2
Although we did not so specify in Forman, we wish to make clear here
that these characteristics are those usually associated with common stock,

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH
681

Opinion of the Court

Under the facts of Forinan,we concluded that the instru-

ments at issue there were not "securities" within the meaning of the Acts. That case involved the sale of shares of
stock entitling the purchaser to lease an apartment in a housing cooperative. The stock bore none of the characteristics
listed above that are usually associated with traditional
stock. Moreover, we concluded that under the circumstances, there was no likelihood that the purchasers had been
misled by use of the word "stock" into thinking that the federal securities laws governed their purchases. The purchasers had intended to acquire low-cost subsidized living space
for their personal use; no one was likely to have believed that
he was purchasing investment securities. Ibid.
In contrast, it is undisputed that the stock involved here
possesses all of the characteristics we identified in Forman
as traditionally associated with common stock. Indeed, the
District Court so found. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a. Moreover, unlike in Forman, the context of the transaction involved here-the sale of stock in a corporation-is typical of
the kind of context to which the Acts normally apply. It is
thus much more likely here than in Formanthat an investor
would believe he was covered by the federal securities laws.
Under the circumstances of this case, the plain meaning of
the statutory definition mandates that the stock be treated
as "securities" subject to the coverage of the Acts.
Reading the securities laws to apply to the sale of stock
at issue here comports with Congress' remedial purpose in
enacting the legislation to protect investors by "compelling
full and fair disclosure relative to the issuance of 'the many
types of instruments that in our commercial world fall within
the ordinary concept of a security."' SEC v. W. J. Howey
Co., 328 U. S., at 299 (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 85, 73d Cong.,
1st Sess., 11 (1933)). Although we recognize that Congress
did not intend to provide a comprehensive federal remedy for
the kind of stock often at issue in cases involving the sale of a business.
Various types of preferred stock may have different characteristics and
still be covered by the Acts.

all fraud, Marine Bank v. Weaver, supra, at 556, we think
it would improperly narrow Congress' broad definition of
''security" to hold that the traditional stock at issue here falls
outside the Acts' coverage.
III

Under other circumstances, we might consider the statutory analysis outlined above to be a sufficient answer compelling judgment for petitioner.' Respondents urge, however,
that language in our previous opinions, including Forman,
requires that we look beyond the label "stock" and the
characteristics of the instruments involved to determine
whether application of the Acts is mandated by the economic
substance of the transaction. Moreover, the Court of Appeals rejected the view that the plain meaning of the definition would be sufficient to hold this stock covered, because
it saw "no principled way," 731 F. 2d, at 1353, to justify
treating notes, bonds, and other of the definitional categories
differently. We address these concerns in turn.
A
It is fair to say that our cases have not been entirely clear
on the proper method of analysis for determining when an
instrument is a "security." This Court has decided a number of cases in which it looked to the economic substance of
the transaction, rather than just to its form, to determine
whether the Acts applied. In SEC v. C. M. JoinerLeasing
Corp., for example, the Court considered whether the 1933
Act applied to the sale of leasehold interests in land near a
proposed oil well drilling. In holding that the leasehold interests were "securities," the Court noted that "the reach of
the Act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace."
320 U. S., at 351. Rather, it ruled that unusual devices such
'Professor Loss suggests that the statutory analysis is sufficient. L.
Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 212 (1983). See infra, at
693-694.

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH

681

Opinion of the Court

as the leaseholds would also be covered "if it be proved as
matter of fact that they were widely offered or dealt in under
terms or courses of dealing which established their character
in commerce as 'investment contracts,' or as 'any interest or
instrument commonly known as a 'security."' Ibid.
SEC v. W. J. Howey Co., supra, further elucidated the
Joiner Court's suggestion that an unusual instrument could
be considered a "security" if the circumstances of the transaction so dictated. At issue in that case was an offering of
units of a citrus grove development coupled with a contract
for cultivating and marketing the fruit and remitting the
proceeds to the investors. The Court held that the offering
constituted an "investment contract" within the meaning of
the 1933 Act because, looking at the economic realities, the
transaction "involve[d] an investment of money in a common
enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of
others." 328 U. S., at 301.
This so-called "Howey test" formed the basis for the second
part of our decision in Forman, on which respondents primarily rely. As discussed above, see Part II, supra, the
first part of our decision in Forman concluded that the
instruments at issue, while they bore the traditional label
"stock," were not "securities" because they possessed none
of the usual characteristics of stock. We then went on to
address the argument that the instruments were "investment
contracts." Applying the Howey test, we concluded that the
instruments likewise were not "securities" by virtue of being
"investment contracts" because the economic realities of the
transaction showed that the purchasers had parted with their
money not for the purpose of reaping profits from the efforts
of others, but for the purpose of purchasing a commodity for
personal consumption. 421 U. S., at 858.
Respondents contend that Formanand the cases on which
it was based 4 require us to reject the view that the shares of

also rely on Tcherepnin v. Knight, 389 U. S. 332 (1967),
and MarineBank v. Weaver, 455 U. S. 551 (1982), as support for their argument that we have mandated in every case a determination of whether

OCTOBER TERM, 1984
Opinion of the Court

471 U. S.

stock at issue here may be considered "securities" because of
their name and characteristics. Instead, they argue that our
cases require us in every instance to look to the economic
substance of the transaction to determine whether the Howey
test has been met. According to respondents, it is clear
that petitioner sought not to earn profits from the efforts
of others, but to buy a company that it could manage and
control. Petitioner was not a passive investor of the kind
Congress intended the Acts to protect, but an active entrepreneur, who sought to "use or consume" the business purchased just as the purchasers in Forman sought to use the
apartments they acquired after purchasing shares of stock.
Thus, respondents urge that the Acts do not apply.
We disagree with respondents' interpretation of our cases.
First, it is important to understand the contexts within which
these cases were decided. All of the cases on which respondents rely involved unusual instruments not easily characterized as "securities." See n. 4, supra. Thus, if the Acts
were to apply in those cases at all, it would have to have been
because the economic reality underlying the transactions indicated that the instruments were actually of a type that falls
within the usual concept of a security. In the case at bar, in
contrast, the instrument involved is traditional stock, plainly
within the statutory definition. There is no need here, as
there was in the prior cases, to look beyond the characteristics of the instrument to determine whether the Acts apply.
the economic realities of a transaction call for the application of the Acts.
It is sufficient to note here that these cases, like the other cases on which
respondents rely, involved unusual instruments that did not fit squarely
within one of the enumerated specific kinds of securities listed in the definition. Tcherepnin involved withdrawable capital shares in a state savings
and loan association, and Weaver involved a certificate of deposit and a privately negotiated profit-sharing agreement. See MarineBank v. Weaver,
supra, at 557, n. 5, for an explanation of why the certificate of deposit
involved there did not fit within the definition's category "certificate of
deposit, for a security."

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH
681

Opinion of the Court

Contrary to respondents' implication, the Court has never
foreclosed the possibility that stock could be found to be a
"security" simply because it is what it purports to be. In
SEC v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U. S. 344 (1943),

the Court noted: "[W]e do nothing to the words of the Act;
we merely accept them .... In some cases, [proving that the

documents were securities] might be done by proving the
document itself, which on its face would be a note, a bond, or

a share of stock." Id., at 355. Nor does Formanrequire a
different result. Respondents are correct that in Forman
we eschewed a "literal" approach that would invoke the Acts'
coverage simply because the instrument carried the label

"stock." Forman does not, however, eliminate the Court's
ability to hold that an instrument is covered when its characteristics bear out the label.

See supra, at 686-687.

Second, we would note that the Howey economic reality
test was designed to determine whether a particular instrument is an "investment contract," not whether it fits within
any of the examples listed in the statutory definition of "security." Our cases are consistent with this view.' Teamsters
5

In support of their contention that the Court has mandated use of the
Howey test whenever it determines whether an instrument is a "security,"
respondents quote our statement in Teamsters v. Daniel, 439 U. S. 551,
558, n. 11 (1979), that the Howey test "'embodies the essential attributes
that run through all of the Court's decisions defining a security"' (quoting
Forman, 421 U. S., at 852). We do not read this bit of dicta as broadly as
respondents do. We made the statement in Forman in reference to the
purchasers' argument that if the instruments at issue were not "stock" and
were not "investment contracts," at least they were "instrument[s] commonly known as a 'security"' within the statutory definition. We stated,
as part of our analysis of whether the instruments were "investment contracts," that we perceived "no distinction, for present purposes, between
an 'investment contract' and an 'instrument commonly known as a "security.""' Ibid. (emphasis added). This was not to say that the Howey test
applied to any case in which an instrument was alleged to be a security, but
only that once the label "stock" did not hold true, we perceived no reason to
analyze the case differently whether we viewed the instruments as "invest-

v. Daniel, 439 U. S., at 558 (appropriate to turn to the
Howey test to "determine whether a particular financial
relationship constitutes an investment contract"); United
Housing Foundation,Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S. 837 (1975);
see supra, at 689. Moreover, applying the Howey test to
traditional stock and all other types of instruments listed
in the statutory definition would make the Acts' enumeration
of many types of instruments superfluous. Golden v. Garafalo, 678 F. 2d 1139, 1144 (CA2 1982). See Tcherepnin v.
Knight, 389 U. S. 332, 343 (1967).
Finally, we cannot agree with respondents that the Acts
were intended to cover only "passive investors" and not
privately negotiated transactions involving the transfer of
control to "entrepreneurs." The 1934 Act contains several
provisions specifically governing tender offers, disclosure of
transactions by corporate officers and principal stockholders,
and the recovery of short-swing profits gained by such persons. See, e. g., 1934 Act, ยงยง14, 16, 15 U. S. C. ยงยง78n, 78p.
Eliminating from the definition of "security" instruments involved in transactions where control passed to the purchaser
would contravene the purposes of these provisions. Accord,
Daily v. Morgan, 701 F. 2d 496, 503 (CA5 1983). Furthermore, although ยง 4(2) of the 1933 Act, 15 U. S. C. ยง 77d(2),
exempts transactions not involving any public offering from
the Act's registration provisions, there is no comparable exemption from the antifraud provisions. Thus, the structure
and language of the Acts refute respondents' position.!
ment contracts" or as falling within another similarly general category of

the definition-an "instrument commonly known as a 'security."' Under
either of these general categories, the Howey test would apply.
'In criticizing the sale of business doctrine, Professor Loss agrees. He
considers that the doctrine "comes dangerously close to the heresy of saying that the fraud provisions do not apply to private transactions; for nobody, apparently, has had the temerity to argue that the sale of a publicly
owned business for stock of the acquiring corporation that is distributed to
the shareholders of the selling corporation as a liquidating dividend does

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH
681

Opinion of the Court

B
We now turn to the Court of Appeals' concern that treating
stock as a specific category of "security" provable by its
characteristics means that other categories listed in the statutory definition, such as notes, must be treated the same
way. Although we do not decide whether coverage of notes
or other instruments may be provable by their name and
characteristics, we do point out several reasons why we think
stock may be distinguishable from most if not all of the other
categories listed in the Acts' definition.
Instruments that bear both the name and all of the usual
characteristics of stock seem to us to be the clearest case for
coverage by the plain language of the definition. First, traditional stock "represents to many people, both trained and
untrained in business matters, the paradigm of a security."
Daily v. Morgan, supra, at 500. Thus persons trading in
traditional stock likely have a high expectation that their
activities are governed by the Acts. Second, as we made
clear in Forman, "stock" is relatively easy to identify because it lends itself to consistent definition. See supra, at
686. Unlike some instruments, therefore, traditional stock
is more susceptible of a plain meaning approach.
Professor Loss has agreed that stock is different from the
other categories of instruments. He observes that it "goes
against the grain" to apply the Howey test for determining
whether an instrument is an "investment contract" to traditional stock. L. Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation 211-212 (1983). As Professor Loss explains:
"It is one thing to say that the typical cooperative apartment dweller has bought a home, not a security; or that
not every installment purchase 'note' is a security; or
that a person who charges a restaurant meal by signing
not involve a security." L. Loss, Fundamentals of Securities Regulation
212 (1983) (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted).

his credit card slip is not selling a security even though
his signature is an 'evidence of indebtedness.' But stock
(except for the residential wrinkle) is so quintessentially
a security as to foreclose further analysis." Id., at 212
(emphasis in original).
We recognize that in SEC v. C. M. JoinerLeasing Corp.,
320 U. S. 344 (1943), the Court equated "notes" and "bonds"
with "stock" as categories listed in the statutory definition
that were standardized enough to rest on their names. Id.,
at 355. Nonetheless, in Forman, we characterized Joiner's
language as dictum. 421 U. S., at 850. As we recently suggested in a different context in Securities Industry Assn. v.
Board of Governors, FRS, 468 U. S. 137 (1984), "note" may
now be viewed as a relatively broad term that encompasses
instruments with widely varying characteristics, depending
on whether issued in a consumer context, as commercial
paper, or in some other investment context. See id., at
149-153. We here expressly leave until another day the
question whether "notes" or "bonds" or some other category
of instrument listed in the definition might be shown "by
proving [only] the document itself." SEC v. C. M. Joiner
Leasing Corp., supra, at 355. We hold only that "stock"
may be viewed as being in a category by itself for purposes
of interpreting the scope of the Acts' definition of "security."
IV
We also perceive strong policy reasons for not employing
the sale of business doctrine under the circumstances of this
case. 7 By respondents' own admission, application of the

doctrine depends in each case on whether control has passed
to the purchaser. It may be argued that on the facts of
this case, the doctrine is easily applied, since the transfer
of 100% of a corporation's stock normally transfers control.
We think even that assertion is open to some question, however, as Dennis and Bolten had no intention of running the
sawmill themselves. Ivan Landreth apparently stayed on to
manage the daily affairs of the business. Some commentraded in a public market." Post, at 698. United Housing Foundation,
Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S., at 849. It also is true that there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress considered the type of transactions involved in this case and in Gould v. Ruefenacht, post, p. 701.
The history is simply silent-as it is with respect to other transactions to
which these Acts have been applied by the Securities and Exchange Commission and judicial interpretation over the half century since this legislation was adopted. One only need mention the expansive interpretation of
ยง 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5 adopted by the Commission. What
the Court said in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723
(1975), is relevant:
"When we deal with private actions under Rule 10b-5, we deal with a judicial oak which has grown from little more than a legislative acorn. Such
growth may be quite consistent with the congressional enactment and with
the role of the federal judiciary in interpreting it, see J. I. Case Co. v
Borak, [377 U. S.426 (1964)], but it would be disingenuous to suggest that
either Congress in 1934 or the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1942 foreordained the present state of the law with respect to Rule 10b-5.
It is therefore proper that we consider, in addition to the factors already
discussed, what may be described as policy considerations when we come
to flesh out the portions of the law with respect to which neither the congressional enactment nor the administrative regulations offer conclusive
guidance." Id., at 737.
See also Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U. S.185, 196-197 (1976).
In this case, unlike with respect to the interpretation of ยง 10(b) in Blue
Chip Stamps, we have the plain language of ยง2(1) of the 1933 Act in support of our interpretation. In Forman, supra, we recognized that the
term "stock" is to be read in accordance with the common understanding
of its meaning, including the characteristics identified in Forman. See
supra, at 686. In addition, as stated in Blue Chip Stamps, supra, it is
proper for a court to consider-as we do today-policy considerations in
construing terms in these Acts.

Opinion of the Court

471 U. S.

tators who support the sale of business doctrine believe that
a purchaser who has the ability to exert control but chooses
not to do so may deserve the Acts' protection if he is simply
a passive investor not engaged in the daily management of
the business. Easley, Recent Developments in the Sale-ofBusiness Doctrine: Toward a Transactional Context-Based
Analysis for Federal Securities Jurisdiction, 39 Bus. Law.
929, 971-972 (1984); Seldin, When Stock is Not a Security:
The "Sale of Business" Doctrine Under the Federal Securities Laws, 37 Bus. Law. 637, 679 (1982). In this case,
the District Court was required to undertake extensive factfinding, and even requested supplemental facts and memoranda on the issue of control, before it was able to decide the
case. App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.
More importantly, however, if applied to this case, the sale
of business doctrine would also have to be applied to cases in
which less than 100% of a company's stock was sold. This
inevitably would lead to difficult questions of line-drawing.
The Acts' coverage would in every case depend not only on
the percentage of stock transferred, but also on such factors
as the number of purchasers and what provisions for voting
and veto rights were agreed upon by the parties. As we
explain more fully in Gould v. Ruefenacht, post, at 704-706,
decided today as a companion to this case, coverage by the
Acts would in most cases be unknown and unknowable to the
parties at the time the stock was sold. These uncertainties
attending the applicability of the Acts would hardly be in the
best interests of either party to a transaction. Cf. Marine
Bank v. Weaver, 455 U. S., at 559, n. 9 (rejecting the argument that the certificate of deposit at issue there was
transformed, chameleon-like, into a "security" once it was
pledged). Respondents argue that adopting petitioner's
approach will increase the workload of the federal courts by
converting state and common-law fraud claims into federal
claims. We find more daunting, however, the prospect that
parties to a transaction may never know whether they are

covered by the Acts until they engage in extended discovery
and litigation over a concept as often elusive as the passage
of control. Accord, Golden v. Garafalo, 678 F. 2d, at
1145-1146.
V
In sum, we conclude that the stock at issue here is a "security" within the definition of the Acts, and that the sale of
business doctrine does not apply. The judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is
therefore
Reversed.
JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.*
In my opinion, Congress did not intend the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to apply to every transaction in a security described in ยง2(1) of the 1933 Act: 1
"The term 'security' means any note, stock, treasury
stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing
agreement, . . .investment contract, voting-trust certificate, . . . or, in general, any interest or instrument

commonly known as a 'security."'

15 U. S. C. ยง77b(1).

See also ante, at 686, n. 1. Congress presumably adopted
this sweeping definition "to prevent the financial community
from evading regulation by inventing new types of financial
instruments rather than to prevent the courts from interpreting the Act in light of its purposes." Sutter v. Groen, 687 F.
2d 197, 201 (CA7 1982).
Moreover, the "broad statutory

Marine Bank v. Weaver, 455

U. S. 551, 556 (1982).
The legislative history of the 1933 and 1934 Securities Acts
makes clear that Congress was primarily concerned with
transactions in securities that are traded in a public market.
In United Housing Foundation, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U. S.
837 (1975), the Court observed:
"The primary purpose of the Acts of 1933 and 1934 was
to eliminate serious abuses in a largely unregulated securities market. The focus of the Acts is on the capital
market of the enterprise system: the sale of securities to
raise capital for profit-making purposes, the exchanges
on which securities are traded, and the need for regulation to prevent fraud and protect the interest of investors. Because securities transactions are economic
in character Congress intended the application of these
statutes to turn on the economic realities underlying
a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto."
Id., at 849.
I believe that Congress wanted to protect investors who do
not have access to inside information and who are not in
a position to protect themselves from fraud by obtaining
appropriate contractual warranties.
At some level of analysis, the policy of Congress must provide the basis for placing limits on the coverage of the Securities Acts. The economic realities of a transaction may determine whether "unusual instruments" fall within the scope of
the Acts, ante, at 690, and whether an ordinary commercial
"note" is covered, ante, at 693-694. The negotiation of an
individual mortgage note, for example, surely would not be
covered by the Acts, although a note is literally a "security"
under the definition. Cf. Chemical Bank v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 726 F. 2d 930, 937 (CA2), cert. denied, 469 U. S.

LANDRETH TIMBER CO. v. LANDRETH

STEVENS,

884 (1984). The marketing to the public of a large portfolio
of mortgage loans, however, might well be. See Sanders v.
John Nuveen & Co., 463 F. 2d 1075, 1079-1080 (CA7), cert.
denied, 409 U. S. 1009 (1972).
I believe that the characteristics of the entire transaction
are as relevant in determining whether a transaction in
"stock" is covered by the Acts as they are in transactions involving "notes," "investment contracts," or the more hybrid
securities. Providing regulations for the trading of publicly
listed stock-whether on an exchange or in the over-thecounter market-was the heart of Congress' legislative program, and even private sales of such securities are surely
covered by the Acts. I am not persuaded, however, that
Congress intended to cover negotiated transactions involving
the sale of control of a business whose securities have never
been offered or sold in any public market. In the latter
cases, it is only a matter of interest to the parties whether
the transaction takes the form of a sale of stock or a sale
of assets, and the decision usually hinges on matters that are
irrelevant to the federal securities laws such as tax liabilities,
the assignability of Government licenses or other intangible
assets, and the allocation of the accrued or unknown liabilities of the going concern. If Congress had intended to
provide a remedy for every fraud in the sale of a going concern or its assets, it would not have permitted the parties to
bargain over the availability of federal jurisdiction.
In short, I would hold that the antifraud provisions of the
federal securities laws are inapplicable unless the transaction
involves (i) the sale of a security that is traded in a public
market; or (ii) an investor who is not in a position to negotiate
appropriate contractual warranties and to insist on access to
inside information before consummating the transaction. Of
course, until the precise contours of such a standard could be
marked out in a series of litigated proceedings, some uncertainty in the coverage of the statutes would be unavoidable.
Nevertheless, I am persuaded that the interests in certainty

and predictability that are associated with a simple "brightline" rule are not strong enough to "justify expanding liability
to reach substantive evils far outside the scope of the legislature's concern." 2 Sutter v. Groen, 687 F. 2d, at 202.
Both of these cases involved a sale of stock in a closely held
corporation. In each case the transaction was preceded by
comprehensive negotiations between the buyer and seller.
There is no suggestion that the buyers were unable to obtain
appropriate warranties or to insist on the exchange and inde-

pendent evaluation of relevant financial information before
entering into the transactions.3 I do not believe Congress
intended the federal securities laws to govern the private
sale of a substantial ownership interest in these operating
businesses simply because the transactions were structured
as sales of stock instead of assets.
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in
No. 83-1961 and reverse the judgment in No. 84-165.

1Infinal analysis, the Court relies on its own evaluation of the relevant
"policy considerations." See ante, at 694-697, and especially n. 7. While
I agree that policy considerations are relevant in construing the Securities
Acts, I would prefer to rely principally on the policies of Congress as
reflected in the legislative history. If extrinsic considerations are to be
given effect, I would place a far different evaluation on the weight of the
conflicting policies, because I strongly believe that this Court should presume that federal legislation is not intended to displace state authority unless Congress has plainly indicated an intent to do so. See, e. g., Bennett
v. New Jersey, 470 U. S.632, 654-655, n. 16 (1985) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Garciav. United States, 469 U. S.70, 89-90 (1984) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting); Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.1032, 1067 (1983) (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting); United States v. Altobella, 442 F. 2d 310, 316 (CA7 1971)
(Stevens, J., for the court). Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.,
449 U. S. 456, 477 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).

Indeed, in No. 83-1961, the parties entered into a lengthy Stock Purchase Agreement containing extensive warranties and other protections
for the purchasers. App. 206-263.
