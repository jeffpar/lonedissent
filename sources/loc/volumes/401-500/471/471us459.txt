HOPFMANN v. CONNOLLY

HOPFMANN ET AL.

V.

CONNOLLY ET AL.

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 84-1440. Decided May 13, 1985
Held: In federal-court proceedings wherein it was claimed that the Massachusetts Democratic Party's Charter, as enforced by a Massachusetts
statute, violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the Court of
Appeals erred in concluding, on the basis of Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U. S.
332, that the claim here was foreclosed by this Court's summary disposition of two appeals from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in
Langone v. Connolly, 460 U. S. 1057. Hicks explained the precedential
effect of a dismissal by this Court "for want of [a] substantial federal
question" where this Court has jurisdiction over an appeal. However,
in Langone this Court dismissed the appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction and thus had no occasion to adjudicate the merits of the constitutional questions presented in the jurisdictional statements. Nor did
the denial of certiorari, upon treating the papers whereon the appeals
were taken in Langone as petitions for certiorari, have any precedential
effect.
Appeal dismissed for want of jurisdiction and, treating the papers as a
petition for certiorari, certiorari granted; 746 F. 2d 97, vacated and
remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Treating
the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for
writ of certiorari, the petition is granted.
Hopfmann filed this action in the Federal District Court for
the District of Massachusetts challenging a provision in the
Charter of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Among
the theories he advanced was a claim that the provision, as
enforced by Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 53, §§ 1-121 (West
1975 and Supp. 1985), violated the First and Fourteenth
Amendments of the United States Constitution. Relying on
Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U. S. 332, 344 (1975), the Court of
Appeals held that the claim was foreclosed by this Court's

summary disposition of two appeals from the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Langone v. Connolly, 460
U. S. 1057 (1983). See 746 F. 2d 97, 100-101 (1984).
In Hicks, the Court explained the precedential effect of
the dismissal "for want of [a] substantial federal question" in
Miller v. California, 418 U. S.915 (1974):
"[Miller] was an appeal from a decision by a state court
upholding a state statute against federal constitutional
attack. A federal constitutional issue was properly
presented, it was within our appellate jurisdiction under
28 U. S. C. § 1257(2), and we had no discretion to refuse
adjudication of the case on its merits as would have been
true had the case been brought here under our certiorari
jurisdiction. We were not obligated to grant the case
plenary consideration, and we did not; but we were required to deal with its merits. We did so by concluding
that the appeal should be dismissed because the constitutional challenge to the California statute was not a
substantial one." 422 U. S., at 343-344.
Because the Court had jurisdiction over the appeal in Miller,
the dismissal involved a rejection of "the specific challenges
presented in the statement of jurisdiction." Mandel v.
Bradley, 432 U. S. 173, 176 (1977) (per curiam).
On the other hand, the order disposing of the appeals in
Langone read:
"Appeals from Sup. Jud. Ct. Mass. dismissed for want
of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeals were taken as petitions for writs of certiorari,
certiorari denied. Reported below: 388 Mass. 185, 446
N. E. 2d 43 [1983]." 460 U. S., at 1057 (emphasis
added).
Because the Court dismissed the appeals for lack of appellate
jurisdiction, we had no occasion to adjudicate the merits of
the constitutional questions presented in the jurisdictional

statements. Nor did the denial of certiorari have any precedential effect. See Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show,
Inc., 338 U. S. 912, 919 (1950) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.,
respecting denial of the petition for certiorari).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated to the
extent it relied on the dismissal of the appeals in Langone,
and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
