OCTOBER TERM, 1984
Per Curiam

471 U. S.

SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP SCHOOL DISTRICT ET AL.
v. KNOLL
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 82-1889.

Argued January 14, 1985-Decided April 17, 1985

Respondent filed suit in Federal District Court on April 21, 1981, under 42
U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that petitioner School District, in August 1979,
May 1980, and December 1980, had discriminated against her on the
basis of sex in failing to promote her to an administrative position. The
court dismissed the § 1983 claim because it was not brought within the
6-month limitations period under the Pennsylvania statute applicable to
actions against a government official for acts done in the execution of his
office. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the 6-year "residuary" provision of the Pennsylvania limitations scheme was applicable.
Held: The Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further consideration in the light of the decision in Wilson v.
Garcia, ante, p. 261, that all § 1983 claims should be characterized for
statute of limitations purposes as actions to recover damages for injuries
to the person.
699 F. 2d 137, vacated and remanded.

against her on the basis of sex in failing to promote her to an
administrative position. She sought equitable and compensatory relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 for the alleged acts of
discrimination which occurred in August 1979, May 1980, and
September 1980.
The District Court dismissed the § 1983 claim because it
was not brought within the 6-month limitations period which
applies to
"[a]n action against any officer of any government unit
for anything done in the execution of his office, except an
action subject to another limitation specified in this
subchapter." 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5522(b)(1) (1982).
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the "application
of the six-month limitations period would be inconsistent with
the policies and legislative history underlying § 1983" and
that "the six-year residuary provision of the limitations
scheme should govern this dispute." 699 F. 2d 137, 139
(CA3 1983). We granted certiorari, 468 U. S. 1204 (1984),
and heard argument.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is now vacated, and
the case is remanded for further consideration in light of our
decision in Wilson v. Garcia, ante, p. 261, in which we have
held that all § 1983 claims should be characterized for statute
of limitations purposes as actions to recover damages for
injuries to the person.
It is so ordered.
