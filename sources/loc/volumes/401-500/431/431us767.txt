WARD v.

ILLINOIS

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS

No. 76-415. Argued April 27, 1977-Decided June 9, 1977
Prior to the decision in Miller v. Californm, 413 U. S. 15, appellant was
convicted of selling obscene sado-masoctistic materials in violation of
the Illinois obscenity statute forbidding the sale of obscene matter and
providing that "[a] thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its
predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond
customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters." The conviction was affirmed after Miller, the Illinois Supreme
Court rejecting appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of the
statute for failure to conform to Miller standards, as well as his claim
that the publications in question were not obscene. Held.
1. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally vague as failing to
give appellant notice that materials dealing with the kind of sexual
conduct involved here could not be legally sold m the State, where
(whether or not the State has complied with Miller's requirement that
the sexual conduct that may not be depicted must be specifically
defined by applicable state law as written or authoritatively construed)
appellant had ample guidance from a previous decision of the Illinois
Supreme Court making it clear that his conduct did not conform to
Illinois law. Pp. 771-773.
2. Sado-masochistic materials are the land of materials that may be
proscribed by state law, Mishkm v. New York, 383 U. S. 502, even
though they were not expressly included withm the examples of the
lands of sexually explicit representations that Miller used to explicate
the aspect of its obscenity definition dealing with patently offensive depictions of specifically defined sexual conduct. P 773.
3. The materials in question were properly found by the courts below
to be obscene under the Illinois statute, which conforms to the Miller
standards, except that it retains the stricter "redeeming social value"
obscenity criterion announced in Memors v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S.
413. P 773.
4. The Illinois statute is not unconstitutionally overbroad for failure
to state specifically the lands of sexual conduct the description or representation of which the State intends to proscribe, where it appears that
in prior decisions the Illinois Supreme Court, although not expressly

describing the kinds of sexual conduct intended to be referred to under
the Miller guideline requiring inquiry "whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined
by the applicable state law," expressly incorporated such guideline as
part of the law and thereby intended as well to adopt the Miller explanatory examples, which gave substantive meaning to such guideline
by indicating the kinds of materials within its reach. Pp. 773-776.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The principal issue in this case is the validity of the
Illinois obscenity statute, considered in light of Miller v CalThere we reaffirmed numerous
iforna, 413 U S. 15 (1973)
prior decisions declaring that "obscene material is unprotected

by the First Amendment," zd., at 23, but acknowledging "the
inherent dangers of undertaking to regulate any form of
expression," ibid., we recognized that official regulation must

be limited to "works which depict or describe sexual conduct"
and that such conduct "must be specifically defined by the
applicable state law, as written or authoritatively construed."
Id., at 24. Basic guidelines for the trier of fact, along with
more specific suggestions, were then offered.

"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be.

community standards' would find that the work, taken
as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, Kozs v Wisconsn, [408 U S. 229,] 230 [(1972)], quoting Roth v
United States, [354 U S. 476,] 489 [(1957)], (b)
whether the work depicts or describes, m a patently
offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the
applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as
a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. We do not adopt as a constitutional standard
the 'utterly without redeeming social value' test of
Memoirs v Massachusetts,383 U S., at 419; that concept
has never commanded the adherence of more than three
Justices at one time. See supra, at 21. If a state law
that regulates obscene material is thus limited, as written
or construed, the First Amendment values applicable to
the States through the Fourteenth Amendment are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate
courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional
claims when necessary See Kozs v Wisconsin, supra, at
232, Memoirs v Massachusetts, supra, at 459-460 (Harlan, J., dissenting), Jacobellis v Ohio, 378 U S., az 204
(Harlan, J., dissenting), New York Times Co. v Sullivan,
376 U S. 254, 284-285 (1964), Roth v United States,
supra, at 497-498 (Harlan, J., concurring and dissenting).
"We emphasize that it is not our function to propose
regulatory schemes for the States. That must await
their concrete legislative efforts. It is possible, however,
to give a few plain examples of what a state statute
could define for regulation under part (b) of the standard
announced in this opinion, supra.
"(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions
of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or
simulated.

of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition
of the genitals." Id., at 24-25. (Footnotes omitted.)
Illinois Rev Stat., c. 38, § 11-20 (a) (1) (1975), forbids the
sale of obscene matter. Section 11-20 (b) defines "obscene"
as follows:
"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a
shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion,
and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of
candor in description or representation of such matters.
A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as
in the case of undeveloped photographs." '
In October 1971 appellant Ward was charged m the State
of Illinois with having sold two obscene publications in violation of § 11-20 (a) (1) A jury was waived. At the bench
trial the State's evidence consisted solely of the two publications--"Bizarre World" and "Illustrated Case Histories, a
Study of Sado-Masochism"--and the testimony of the police
officer who purchased them in Ward's store. Ward was found
guilty, and in April 1972, he was sentenced to one day in jail
and fined $200. His conviction was affirmed in the state
appellate courts after this Court's decision in Miller The
Illinois Supreme Court expressly rejected his challenge to the
constitutionality of the Illinois obscenity statute for failure
to conform to the standards of Miller, as well as a claim that
the two publications were not obscene. 63 Ill. 2d 437, 349
N. E. 2d 47 (1976)
Ward appealed, and we noted probable
jurisdiction, 429 U S. 1037 (1977), to resolve a conflict with a
'Section 11-20 (c) provides:
"(c) Interpretation of Evidence.
"Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that
it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible
audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to
such an audience."

decision of a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Eagle Books, Inc. v Remhard, 418 F Supp.
345 (1976), appeal docketed, No. 76-366. We affirm.
As we read the questions presented by Ward,2 they fairly
subsume four issues. First, is the claim that Illinois has failed
to comply with Miller's requirement that the sexual conduct
that may not be depicted in a patently offensive way must be
"specifically defined by the applicable state law as written or
authoritatively construed," see supra, at 768, and that absent
such compliance the Illinois law is unconstitutionally vague
because it failed to give him notice that materials dealing with
the kind of sexual conduct involved here could not legally be
sold in the State. This claim is wholly without merit. As
we shall see below, the State has complied with Miller, but
even if this were not the case, appellant had ample guidance
from the Illinois Supreme Court that his conduct did not conform to the Illinois law Materials such as these, which by
title or content may fairly be described as sado-masochistic,
had been expressly held to violate the Illinois statute long
before Miller and prior to the sales for which Ward was
prosecuted.
In People v Sikora, 32 Ill. 2d 260, 267-268, 204 N. E. 2d
768, 772-773 (1965), there are detailed recitations of the kind
of sexual conduct depicted in the materials found to be
obscene under the Illinois statute. These recitations included
"sadism and masochism." 3 See also People v DeVilbiss, 41
2

The questions presented in Ward's Jurisdictional Statement 3 are

(1) whether the provisions of § 11-20, "on its face and as construed by
the Illinois Supreme Court, are vague, indefinite, overbroad and uncertain, in violation of the free speech and press and due process provisions

of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United
States", and (2) whether "the publications, 'Bizarre World' and 'Illustrated Case Histories, a Study of Sado-Masochism' are constitutionally
protected, as a matter of law."
sThe Illinois Supreme Court described the materials as follows, 32 Ill.
2d, at 267-268, 204 N. E. 2d, at 772-773:
"'Lust Campus' by Andrew Shaw is a story of sexual adventures on a

Geract, 46 Ill. 2d 576, 582-583, 264 N. E. 2d 153, 157 (1970) '
The construction of the statute in Sikora gives detailed meaning to the Illinois law, is binding on us, and makes plain that
§ 11-20 reaches the kind of sexual materials which we now
college campus 'where even members of the faculty taught sin and evil.'
The book describes homosexuals 'necking' on a public beach, mutual
masturbation, self-fondling; a circle of persons engaged in oral-genital
contact; rape; intercourse; lesbian intercourse; cunnilingus and flagellation, flagellation with barbed wire; an abortion with red-hot barbed wire;
masturbation with a mirror reflection, and a transvestite episode.
"'Passion Bride' by John Dexter described curricular and extracurricular sexual episodes that take place during a honeymoon on the French
Riviera. The book describes masturbation, intercourse; a party between
an old man and three prostitutes; attempted intercourse in a bath, lesbian
foreplay; flagellation, rape ending in the death of the female from a
broken back and intercourse ending in the broken back of the male
participant.
"'Crossroads of Lust' by Andrew Shaw describes the sexual adventures
of various persons in a small town. There are numerous descriptions of
intercourse; lesbian intercourse; oral-genital contact; and rape. A woman
stabs a man in the course of intercourse, completing the act after he is
dead. There are also three voyeurism scenes, two of which involve
watching lesbian love play The third is characterized by sadism and

masochism."
4 Tis case involved a local ordinance that the Illinois Supreme Court
described as identical to the state statute. The court described the materials at issue:
"The books are replete with accounts of homosexual acts, masturbation,
flagellation, oral-genital acts, rape, voyeurism, masochism and sadism.
These accounts can only appeal to the prurient interest, and clearly go
beyond customary limits of candor in the kinds of conduct described and
in the detail of description." 41 Ill. 2d, at 142, 242 N. E. 2d, at 765.
5The materials under scrutiny-also under a local ordinance-were
described by the court:
"The author's accounts of normal and abnormal sexual conduct, including
sodomy, flagellation, masturbation, oral-genital contact, anal intercourse,
lesbianism, and sadism and masochism, are vivid, intimately detailed, and

have before us. If Ward cannot be convicted for selling these
materials, it is for other reasons and not because the Illinois
statute is vague and gave him no notice that the statute
purports to ban the kind of materials he sold. The statute is
not vague as applied to Ward's conduct.
Second, Ward appears to assert that sado-masochistic materials may not be constitutionally proscribed because they are
not expressly included within the examples of the kinds of
sexually explicit representations that Miller used to explicate
the aspect of its obscenity definition dealing with patently offensive depictions of specifically defined sexual conduct. But
those specifics were offered merely as "examples," 413 U S., at
25, and, as later pointed out in Hamling v United States, 418
U S. 87, 114 (1974), they "were not intended to be exhaustive."
Furthermore, there was no suggestion in Miller that we intended to extend constitutional protection to the kind of flagellatory materials that were among those held obscene in
Mishkin v New York, 383 U S. 502, 505-510 (1966) If the
Mishkin publications remain unprotected, surely those before
us today deal with a category of sexual conduct which, if
obscenely described, may be proscribed by state law
The third claim is simply that these materials are not
obscene when examined under the three-part test of Miller
This argument is also foreclosed by Mishkmn v New York,
supra, which came down the same day as Memoirs v Massachusetts, 383 U S. 413 (1966), and which employed the
obscenity criteria announced by the latter case. See Marks
The courts
v United States, 430 U S. 188, 194 (1977)
below examined the materials and found them obscene under
the Illinois statute, which, as we shall see, znfra, at 774-776,
conforms to the standards set out in Miller, except that it
retains the stricter Memoirs formulation of the "redeeming
social value" factor. We have found no reason to differ with
the Illinois courts.
Fourth, even assuming that the Illinois statute had been

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion of the Court

431 U. S.

construed to overcome the vagueness challenge in this case and
even assuming that the materials at issue here are not protected under Miller, there remains the claim that Illinois has
failed to conform to the Miller requirement that a state
obscenity law, as written or authoritatively construed, must
state specifically the kinds of sexual conduct the description
or representation of which the State intends to proscribe by
its obscenity law If Illinois has not complied with this
requirement, its statute is arguably overbroad, unconstitutional on its face, and an invalid predicate for Ward's
conviction.
As we see it, Illinois has not failed to comply with Miller,
and its statute is not overbroad. People v Rtdens, 51 Ill. 2d
410, 282 N. E. 2d 691 (1972), vacated and remanded, 413 U S.
912 (1973), involved a conviction under this same Illinois
obscenity law It was pending on our docket when our 3udgment and opinion in Miller issued. We vacated the R2dens
judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in
the light of Miller On remand, the Illinois Supreme
Court explained that originally § 11-20 had provided the
tests for obscenity found in Roth v United States, 354
U S. 476 (1957), and that it subsequently had been
construed to incorporate the tripartite standard found
in Memoirs v Massachusetts, supra, including the requirement that the materials prohibited be "utterly without
redeeming social value." People v R2dens, 59 Ill. 2d 362,
321 N. E. 2d 264 (1974)
The Illinois court then proceeded to
"construe section 11-20 of the Criminal Code
to incorporate parts (a) and (b) of the Miller standards," 2d., at
373, 321 N. E. 2d, at 270, but to retain the "utterly without
redeeming social value" standard of Memoirs in preference to
the more relaxed criterion contained in part (c) of the Miller
guidelines. Ridens' conviction was affirmed, and we denied
certiorari. 6 421 U S. 993 (1975)

WARD v. ILLINOIS
767

Opinion of the Court

Because the Illinois court did not go further and expressly
describe the kinds of sexual conduct intended to be referred
to under part (b) of the Miller guidelines, the issue is whether
the Illinois obscenity law is open-ended and overbroad. As we
understand the Illinois Supreme Court, however, the statute is
not vulnerable in this respect. That court expressly incorporated into the statute part (b) of the guidelines, which requires
inquiry "whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently
offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law" 413 U S., at 24. The Illinois court thus
must have been aware of the need for specificity and of the
Miller Court's examples explaining the reach of part (b) See
zd., at 25. The Illinois court plainly intended to conform
the Illinois law to part (b) of Miller, and there is no reason
to doubt that, in incorporating the guideline as part of the
law, the Illinois court intended as well to adopt the Miller
examples, which gave substantive meaning to part (b) by
indicating the kinds of materials within its reach. The alternative reading of the decision would lead us to the untenable
conclusion that the Illinois Supreme Court chose to create a
fatal flaw in its statute by refusing to take cogmzance of the
specificity requirement set down in Miller
Furthermore, in a later case, People v Gould, 60 Ill. 2d
159, 324 N. E. 2d 412 (1975), the Illinois Supreme Court
qqoted at length from Miller v Californwa, including the
entire passage set out at the beginning of this opinion, supra,
at 768-770-a passage that contains the explanatory examples
as well as the guidelines. It then stated that Ridens had construed the Illinois statute to include parts (a) and (b) of the
Miller guidelines, and it expressly referred to the standards set
out in the immediately preceding quotation from Miller 60
Ill. 2d, at 164-165, 324 N. E. 2d, at 415. Because the quotation contained not only part (b) but the examples given to
four Justices so request, the Court will give plenary consideration to a

particular case. 421 U. S., at 994 n.

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion of the Court

431 U. S.

explain that part, it would be a needlessly technical and wholly
unwarranted reading of the Illinois opinions to conclude that
the state court did not adopt these explanatory examples as
well as the guidelines themselves.
It might be argued that, whether or not the Illinois court
adopted the Miller examples as part of its law, § 11-20 nevertheless remains overbroad because the State has not provided
an exhaustive list of the sexual conduct the patently offensive
description of which may be held obscene under the statute.
We agree with the Illinois Supreme Court, however, that "in
order that a statute be held overbroad the overbreadth 'must
not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.' (Broadrck v Oklahoma, 413 U S. 601, 615
)" People v Ridens, supra,
at 372, 321 N E. 2d, at 269. Since it is plain enough
from its prior cases and from its response to Miller that the
Illinois court recognizes the limitations on the kinds of sexual
conduct which may not be represented or depicted under the
obscenity laws, we cannot hold the Illinois statute to be
unconstitutionally overbroad.
Given that Illinois has adopted Miller's explanatory examples, what the State has done in attempting to bring its
statute in conformity with Miller is surely as much as this
Court did in its post-Miller construction of federal obscenity
statutes. In Hamling v United States, 418 U S., at 114,
we construed 18 U S. C. § 1461, which prohibits the
mailing of obscene matter, to be limited to "the sort of"
patently offensive representations or descriptions of that specific hardcore sexual conduct given as examples in Miller
We have also indicated our approval of an identical approach
with respect to the companion provisions of 18 U S. C. § 1462,
which prohibits importation or transportation of obscene
matter. See United States v 12 200-Ft. Reels of Film, 413
U S. 123, 130 n. 7 (1973)

The decision in this case confirms the statement in Miller
v Californw, 413 U S.15, 23, that "[t]his is an area in which
there are few eternal verities." Today, the Court silently
abandons one of the cornerstones of the Miller test announced
so forcefully just five years ago.
The Miller Court stated.
"Under the holdings announced today, no one will be
subject to prosecution for the sale or exposure of obscene materials unless these materials depict or describe
patently offensive 'hard core' sexual conduct specifically
defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed. We are satisfied that these specific prerequisites
will provide fair notice to a dealer in such materials that

his public and commercial activities may bring prosecution." Id., at 27
The specificity requirement is stressed elsewhere in the opinion.' More than 50 cases were remanded for further consideration to give the defendants the "benefit" of this aspect
of Miller See 413 U S. 902 et seq., Marks v United
States, 430 U S. 188, 197 n. 12.
Many state courts, taking Miller at face value, invalidated
or substantially limited their obscenity laws.2 Others, like
Illinois, did "little more than pay lip service to the specificity
requirement in Miller" F Schauer, The Law of Obscenity
Like most pre-Miller obscenity statutes, the
167 (1976)
Illinois statute contained open-ended terms broad enough to
prohibit the distribution of any material making an "apto prurient interest." 3 In its post-Miller opinions,

"That conduct must be specifically defined by the applicable state
law, as written or authoritatively construed.

specifically defined by the applicable state law
On the following page, the Court gives examples of such "specific"
definitions.
2 E. g., State v Harding, 114 N. H. 335, 321 A. 2d 108 (1974), People v.
Tabron, 320 Colo. 646, 544 P 2d 372 (1976), ABC Interstate Theatres,
Inc. v State, 325 So. 2d 123 (Miss. 1976), State v. Wedelstedt, 213 N. W
2d 652 (Iowa 1973), Commonwealth v Horton, 365 Mass. 164, 310 N. E.
2d 316 (1974). Many statutes passed since Miller have included definitions more specific than that given in Miller See, e. g., La Rev Stat.
Ann. § 14.106 (1974), N. Y. Penal Law § 235.00 (McKinney 1974 and
Supp. 1976).

This Court saved such a statute in Hamling v. United States, 418

In its final footnote to United States v 12 200-Ft. Reels of Film,
413 U. S. 123, 130 n. 7, the Court had stated that it was prepared to
construe generic words such as "obscene" and "lewd" in 18 U S. C. § 1462,
"as limiting regulated material to patently offensive representations or
descriptions of that specific 'hard core' sexual conduct given as examples in

WARD v. ILLINOIS

STEVENs, J., dissenting

the Illinois Supreme Court has made it clear that the statute
covers all of the Miller examples. It has not, however, stated
that the statute is limited to those examples, or to any other
specifically defined category 4
Miller" (Emphasis added.) In Hamling, the Court quoted this language and added:
"As noted above, we indicated in [12 200-Ft. Reels of Film] that we
were prepared to construe the generic terms m 18 U. S. C. § 1462 to be
limited to the sort of 'patently offensive representations or descriptions
of that specific "hard core" sexual conduct given as examples m Miller v.
Californa: We now so construe the companion provision in 18 U. S. C.
§ 1461
" 418 U. S., at 114,
In a well-reasoned opimon, a three-Sudge District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois carefully reviewed the Illinois authorities and
concluded that Illinois has failed to meet the specificity requirement of
Miller Eagle Books, Inc. v. Remhard, 418 F Supp. 345 (ND Ill. 1976).
This conclusion is well founded.
The Illinois statute defines obscenity in these terms:
"A thing is obscene if, considered as a whole, its predominant appeal is
to prurient interest, that is, a shameful or morbid interest m nudity, sex
or excretion, and if it goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor
m description or representation of such matters." Ill. Rev Stat., c. 38,
§ 11-20 (b) (1975).
Nothing in this definition or the rest of the statute "specifically defines"
what depiction of hard-core sexual conduct is prohibited.
The Illinois Supreme Court has not remedied this deficiency by supplymg a limiting construction. In its primary discussion of the State's obscenity
statute in relation to the Miller specificity requirement, People v. Ridens,
59 Ill. 2d 362, 321 N. E. 2d 264 (1974) (Ridens 1I), the Illinois Supreme
Court relied on two cases to uphold the statute. In the first case, Grayned
v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 110, this Court noted m language quoted
by the Illinois court that "[t]he words of the Rockford ordinance are
marked by 'flexibility and reasonable breadth, rather than meticulous specificity
"'
The second case which the Ridens H court relied upon was
its own decision in People v. Raby, 40 Ill. 2d 392, 240 N. E. 2d 595 (1968).
That case concerned the alleged vagueness of a statute designed to prohibit
public disorder. The Illinois court quoted the following language from
Raby, and in the next sentence relied upon that decision and Grayned in
upholding the statute's specificity"It is true that section 26-i (a) does not attempt to particularize all

Nevertheless, this Court affirms the conviction in this
Illinois case on two theories. The first is that this particular
defendant had notice that the State considered these materials obscene, because prior Illinois cases had upheld obscenity
convictions concerning similar material. But, if such notice
is all that is required, it is difficult to understand why the
Miller case itself was remanded for consideration of the
specificity issue, see 413 U S., at 37 For the description of
of the myriad kinds of conduct that may fall within the statute. The legislature deliberately chose to frame the provision in general terms,
prompted by the futility of an effort to anticipate and enumerate all of
the methods of disrupting public order that fertile minds might devise."
40 Ill.
2d, at 396, 240 N. E. 2d, at 598.
Neither of these decisions requires conduct to be specifically defined,
indeed, Raby notes that to survive a vagueness attack a statute need
not "attempt to particularize all of the myriad kinds of conduct" within
its bounds. This may be true for other vagueness attacks, but does not
square with the special Miller requirement that conduct be specifically
defined. Nowhere else in the Ridens 1I opinion does the Illinois Supreme
Court limit the reach of the obscenity statute.
In the present case, the Illinois Supreme Court again considered
the specificity problem, and again refused to narrow the statute:
"It was held in Ridens II that the obscenity statute was sufficiently
clear and that it adequately informed the public of the conduct whose
depiction is proscribed. We noted that the statutory definition of
obscenity includes within the scope of the 'prurient interest' a 'shameful
or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion.' The defendant argues
that we erred in Ridens II in our interpretation of Miller and that Miller
requires obscenity statutes to be much more specific in defining the
type of material which will be considered obscene. We see no reason
to reconsider our decision in Ridens II. It is extremely difficult to
define the term 'obscenity' with a fine degree of precision. We again
express our opiion that Illinois' statutory definition is sufficiently clear
to withstand constitutional objections." 63 Ill. 2d 437, 441, 349 N. E. 2d
47, 49 (1976)
Thus, there does not appear to be anything in the Illinois decisions
that would preclude the State from prosecuting forms of obscenity not
"specifically defined" in prior decisions. And, as noted above, the statute
provides no specific definition in this area.

WARD v. ILLINOIS
767

STnVENs, J., dissenting

the materials involved in Miller leaves no room for doubt that
they were similar to materials which had often been the
subject of prosecutions in the past, I there clearly was no
question of fair notice.'
The Court's second theory is that, in any event, the Illinois
statute is sufficiently specific to satisfy Miller Although the
statute does not contain an "exhaustive list" of specific examples, ante, at 776, it passes muster because it contains a
generic reference to "the k?nds of sexual conduct which may
"
not be represented or depicted under the obscenity laws
Ibzd. (emphasis in original) To hold that the list need
not be exhaustive is to hold that a person can be prosecuted
although the materials he sells are not specifically described
in the list. Only five years ago, the Court promised that
"no one" could be so prosecuted, Miller, 413 U S., at 27 And
if the statute need only describe the "kinds" of proscribed
sexual conduct, it adds no protection to what the Constitution
itself creates. For in Jenkins v Georgia, 418 U S. 153, this
Court held that the Constitution protected all expression
which is not "within either of the two examples given in
Miller" or "sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment." Id., at 161.
5 The materials are described as follows in the opinion:
"While the brochures contain some descriptive printed material, primarily they consist of pictures and drawings very explicitly depicting men
and women in groups of two or more engaging in a variety of sexual ac-

tivities, with genitals often prominently displayed." 413 U S., at 18.
The State's description was somewhat more specific:
"The materials involved are a collection of depictions of cunnilingus,
sodomy, buggery and other similar sexual acts performed in groups of two
or more." Brief for Appellee m No. 70-73, 0. T. 1972, p. 26.
0If fair notice is the issue, it is hard to see how this can be provided
by a narrowing construction made after the underlying conduct. Yet m
Hamling, 418 U. S., at 115-116, the Court held such ex post facto "notice"
sufficient.

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
STEVENS, J., dissenting

431 U. S.

One of the strongest arguments against regulating obscenity
through criminal law is the inherent vagueness of the obscenity concept. The specificity requirement as described in
Miller held out the promise of a principled effort to respond
to that argument. By abandoning that effort today, the
Court withdraws the cornerstone of the Miller structur and,
undoubtedly, hastens its ultimate downfall. Although the
decision is therefore a mixed blessing, I nevertheless respectfully dissent.
