Turner v Fouche, 396 U S. 346,

361-364 (1970)
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.

Appellant, E. C. Chappelle, Jr., wished to serve, upon
appointment, as a commissioner on the Greater Baton Rouge
Airport Commission. He, however, was deemed not qualified
since, at the time of his appointment, he owned no "property
assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish," as required by Louisiana Act 151 of 1969. The sole requirement is that he own
property, whether real or personal, that is assessed in that
parish. We sit to judge the constitutionality, not the wisdom,
of this restriction. I am unable to agree that the Constitution, or prior cases from this Court, require today's declaration
of unconstitutionality
This Court has regularly sustained the imposition of city
or county residency requirements on municipal employees.

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
REHNQUIST,

J., dissenting

431 U. S.

denied, 429 U S. 1027 (1976)
It is dubious at best whether
the requirement that a public officeholder own any assessable
property within a parish is any more burdensome, or any less
rational, than a requirement that he and his family live in
that parish.
This Court has also sustained durational residency requirements of five and seven years for candidates for the office of
state governor and senator, Kanapaux v Ellisor, 419 U S. 891
(1974), Sununu v Stark, 420 U S. 958 (1975)
If a State
can impose a five-year residency requirement on its candidates
for its highest political office, it should be able to impose a
minimal locational property requirement on persons seeking
office in this airport district.
The Louisiana Court of Appeal concluded.
"In enacting Act 151 of 1969, the legislature sought to
insure that the members of the commission would have
a substantial interest m performing their duties effectively
and conscientiously The legislature could have concluded reasonably that property owners of East Baton
Rouge Parish would have that interest." App. 22-23.
Surely it was as reasonable to conclude so in this case as it
is in situations involving residency, or durational residency,
requirements. Since I believe today's opinion is inconsistent
with these cases, and since, in light of these later cases, I
would not extend Turner v Fouche, 396 U S. 346, 361-364
(1970), I respectfully dissent.
