UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK,
TRUSTEE v. NEW JERSEY ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW JERSEY

No. 75-1687

Argued November 10, 1976-Decided April 27, 1977

A 1962 statutory covenant between New Jersey and New York limited the
ability of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to subsidize
rail passenger transportation from revenues and reserves pledged as
security for consolidated bonds issued by the Port Authority A 1974
New Jersey statute, together with a concurrent and parallel New York
statute, retroactively repealed the 1962 covenant. Appellant, both as
a trustee for, and as a holder of, Port Authority bonds, brought suit in
the New Jersey Superior Court for declaratory relief, claiming that the
1974 New Jersey statute inpaired the obligation of the States' contract
with the bondholders in violation of the Contract Clause of the United
States Constitution. The Superior Court dismissed the complaint after
trial, holding that the statutory repeal was a reasonable exercise of New
Jersey's police power and was not prohibited by the Contract Clause.
The New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed. Held. The Contract Clause
prohibits the retroactive repeal of the 1962 covenant. Pp. 14-32.
(a) The outright repeal of the 1962 covenant totally eliminated an
important security provision for the bondholders and thus impaired the
obligation of the States' contract. Pp. 17-21.
(b) The security provision of the 1962 covenant was purely a financial

obligation and thus not necessarily a compromise of the States' reserved
powers that cannot be contracted away Pp. 21-25.
(c) The repeal of the 1962 covenant cannot be sustained on the basis
of Faitoute Iron & Steel Co. v City of Asbury Park, 316 U. S. 502, and
W B Worthen Co. v Kavanaugh, 295 U. S. 56, simply because the
bondholders' rights were not totally destroyed. Pp. 26-28.
(d) An impairment of contract such as is involved m this case can
only be upheld if it is both reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose, but here the impairment was neither necessary to
achieve the States' plan to encourage private automobile users to shift
to public transportation nor reasonable m light of changed circumstances.
Total repeal of the 1962 covenant was not essential, since the States'
plan could have been implemented with a less drastic modification of the
covenant, and since, without modifying the covenant at all, the States
could have adopted alternative means of achievmg their twin goals of
discouraging automobile use and improving mass transit. Nor can the
repeal be claimed to be reasonable on the basis of the need for mass
transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection, since
the 1962 covenant was adopted with knowledge of such concerns. Pp.
28-32.

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY
Opimon of the Court
MR. JUSTICE BIJACKMUN

delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents a challenge to a New Jersey statute, 1974
N. J Laws, c. 25, as violative of the Contract Clause' of the
United States Constitution. That statute, together with a
concurrent and parallel New York statute, 1974 N. Y Laws,
c. 993, repealed a statutory covenant made by the two States
in 1962 that had limited the ability of The Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey 2 to subsidize rail passenger transportation from revenues and reserves.
The suit, one for declaratory relief, was instituted by appellant United States Trust Company of New York in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Bergen County
Named as defendants were the State of New Jersey, its Governor, and its Attorney General. Plaintiff-appellant sued as
trustee for two series of Port Authority Consolidated Bonds,
as a holder of Port Authority Consolidated Bonds, and on
behalf of all holders of such bonds.'
After a trial, the Superior Court ruled that the statutory
repeal was a reasonable exercise of New Jersey's police power,
and declared that it was not prohibited by the Contract
Clause or by its counterpart in the New Jersey Constitution,
Art. IV, § 7, ff 3. Accordingly, appellant's complaint was

BACKGROUND
A. Establishment of the PortAuthority. The Port Authority was established in 1921 by a bistate compact to effectuate
"a better co-ordination of the terminal, transportation and
other facilities of commerce in, about and through the port of
New York." 1921 N. J Laws, c. 151, p. 413, 1921 N. Y
Laws, c. 154, p. 493. See N. J Stat. Ann. § 32:1-1 et seq.
(1940), N. Y Unconsol. Laws § 6401 et seq. (McKinney
1961)
The compact, as the Constitution requires, Art. I,
§ 10, cl. 3, received congressional consent. 42 Stat. 174.
The compact granted the Port Authority enumerated
powers and, by its Art. III, "such other and additional powers
as shall be conferred upon it by the Legislature of either State
concurred in by the Legislature of the other, or by Act or Acts
of Congress." The powers are enumerated in Art. VI.
Among them is "full power and authority to purchase, construct, lease and/or operate any terminal or transportation
facility within said district." "Transportation facility" is
defined, in Art. XXII, to include "railroads, steam or electric,
for use for the transportation or carriage of persons
or property"
The Port Authority was conceived as a financially independent entity, with funds primarily derived from private investors.
The preamble to the compact speaks of the "encouragement of
4The State of New York is not a party to this case, although its
Attorney General has filed a brief as amicus curae. A challenge to the
parallel New York statute has been pending in the Supreme Court of

the investment of capital," and the Port Authority was given
power to mortgage its facilities and to pledge its revenues to
secure the payment of bonds issued to private investors.'
See generally E. Bard, The Port of New York Authority
(1942)
B. Initial Policy Regarding Mass Transit. Soon after the
Port Authority's inception, the two States, again with the consent of Congress, 42 Stat. 822, agreed upon a comprehensive

plan for the entity's development.

1922 N. J Laws, c. 9,

1922 N. Y Laws, c. 43. This plan was concerned primarily, if
not solely, with transportation of freight by carriers and not
with the movement of passengers in the Port Authority disThe New
trict. The plan, however, was not implemented.'
5

The Port Authority possessed no taxing power and was unable to
pledge the credit of either State. The trial court found:
"Under the terms of the Compact the power to levy taxes or to pledge
the credit of either state was expressly withheld from the Authority
From its inception, with the exception of monies advanced as loans by the
states, the Authority was required to finance its facilities solely with money
borrowed from the public and to be repaid out of the revenues derived
from its operations. By reason of these financial limitations two concepts
initially emerged which have played an important role m the realization of
the purposes for which the Authority was created: first, the specific projects undertaken by the Authority should be self-supporting, z. e., the revenues of each should be sufficient to cover its operating expenses and debt
service requirements; and second, since the Authority is a public agency
over which its creditors have no direct control, the bondholders should be
protected by covenants with the Authority and with the states which
have ultimate control over its operations." 134 N. J. Super. 124, 139-140,
338 A. 2d 833, 841 (1975).
The two States subsequently took steps to protect the Port Authority's
financial integrity See, for example, the 1925 statutory declarations not
to authorize the construction of competitive bridges within the district
or to limit the right of the Port Authority to levy such charges and tolls
as it deemed necessary to produce revenues to fund its bonds. 1925 N. J.
Laws, c. 37, § 5, 1925 N. Y. Laws, c. 210, § 5.
6 The parties are not m agreement as to the original perception of the
compact and the plan. The appellant claims that the Port Authority

Jersey Legislature at that time declared that the plan "does
not include the problem of passenger traffic," even though that
problem "should be considered in co-operation with the port
1922 Laws, c. 104. The Port
development commission."
Authority itself recognized the existence of the passenger
service problem. 1924 Annual Report 23, 1928 Annual
Report 64-66, App. 574a-575a.
In 1927 the New Jersey Legislature, in an Act approved by
the Governor, directed the Port Authority to make plans
"supplementary to or amendatory of the comprehensive
as will provide adequate interstate and suburban
plan
transportation facilities for passengers." 1927 Laws, c. 277
The New York Legislature followed suit in 1928, but its bill
encountered executive veto. The trial court observed that
this veto "to all intents and purposes ended any legislative
effort to involve the Port Authority in an active role in commuter transit for the next 30 years." 134 N. J Super., at 149,
338 A. 2d, at 846.
was organized "as a freight coordinating agency," Brief for Appellant 5,
whereas the appellees challenge that description and emphasize the presence of a mass transit problem as a factor of profound concern in the
Port Authority's development. Brief for Appellees 2-5. The trial court
found that neither the commission which recommended the creation of the
Port Authority nor the comprehensive plan contemplated responsibility
of the agency for passenger transit. 134 N. J. Super., at 134-139, 338 A.
2d, at 838-841.
7 Governor Alfred E. Smith m his statement in support of his veto
said:
"[I]t has been a great disappointment to me to find that the opposition
of the railroads has prevented to date the making of real progress m
working out the program of freight distribution m the port which always
has been the main object and purpose of the Port of New York Authority I am satisfied that the Port Authority should stick to this program
and I am entirely unwilling to give my approval to any measure which
at the expense of the solution of the great freight distribution problem
will set the Port Authority off on an entirely new line of problem connected with the solution of the suburban passenger problem." App. 573a574a.

C. Port Authority Fiscal Policy. Four bridges for motor
vehicles were constructed by the Port Authority A separate
series of revenue bonds was issued for each bridge. Revenue
initially was below expectations, but the bridges ultimately
accounted for much of the Port Authority's financial strength.
The legislatures transferred the operation and revenues of
the successful Holland Tunnel to the Port Authority, and this
more than made up for the early bridge deficits.
The States m 1931 also enacted statutes creating the general
reserve fund of the Port Authority 1931 N. J Laws, c. 5,
1931 N. Y Laws, c. 48. Surplus revenues from all Port
Authority facilities were to be pooled in the fund to create an
irrevocably pledged reserve equal to one-tenth of the par value
of the Port Authority's outstanding bonds. This level was
attained 15 years later, in 1946.
In 1952, the Port Authority abandoned the practice of earmarking specific facility revenues as security for bonds of
that facility The Port Authority's Consolidated Bond Resolution established the present method of financing its activities, under this method its bonds are secured by a pledge of
the general reserve fund.8
8

The appellees state that the creation of the general reserve fund
"made the Port Authority's fiscal strength possible." Brief for Appellees
6 n. 7
The parties, however, are in disagreement as to the actual and proper
fiscal policy of the Port Authority Appellant claims that each facility
should have prospects of producing sufficient revenue to support itself.
Appellees' position is apparent from their assertion that although the selfsupporting-facility concept may have "initially emerged," as the trial court
stated, 134 N. J. Super., at 140, 338 A. 2d, at 841, "the concept had no
practical significance because it was not attained prior to 1931 and was
unnecessary after 1931," with the establishment of the general reserve
fund. Brief for Appellees 7
The trial court observed that upon the adoption of the Consolidated
Bonds Resolution in 1952, the self-supporting-facility concept "ceased to
have the significance previously attached to it." 134 N. J. Super., at
143, 338 A. 2d, at 843.

D Renewed Interest 2n Mass Transit. Meanwhile, the
two States struggled with the passenger transportation problem. Many studies were made. The situation was recognized as critical, great costs were envisioned, and substantial
deficits were predicted for any mass transit operation. The
Port Authority itself financed a study conducted by the
Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission which the States
had established in 1954.
In 1958, Assembly Bill No. 16 was introduced in the New
Jersey Legislature. This would have had the Port Authority
take over, improve, and operate interstate rail mass transit
between New Jersey and New York. The bill was opposed
vigorously by the Port Authority on legal and financial
grounds. The Port Authority also retaliated, in a sense, by
including a new safeguard in its contracts with bondholders.
This prohibited the issuance of any bonds, secured by the
general reserve fund, for a new facility unless the Port Authority first certified that the issuance of the bonds would
not "materially impair the sound credit standing" of the Port
Authority App. 812a. Bill No. 16 was not passed.
In 1959, the two States, with the consent of Congress, Pub.
L. 86-302, 73 Stat. 575, created the New York-New Jersey
Transportation Agency to deal "with matters affecting public
mass transit within and between the 2 States." 1959 N. J
Laws, c. 13, § 3.1, as amended by c. 24, 1959 N. Y Laws, c.
420, § 3.1.
Also in 1959, the two States enacted legislation providing
that upon either State's election the Port Authority would
be authorized to purchase and own railroad passenger cars for
the purpose of leasing them to commuter railroads. 1959 N J
Laws, c. 25, 1959 N. Y Laws, c. 638. Bonds issued for this
purpose would be guaranteed by the electing State. New
York so elected, N. Y Const., Art. X, § 7, effective January 1, 1962, and approximately $100 million of Commuter Car
Bonds were issued by the Port Authority to purchase about

500 air-conditioned passenger cars and eight locomotives used
on the Penn Central and Long Island Railroads.
E. The 1962 Statutory Covenant. In 1960 the takeover of
the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad by the Port Authority was
proposed. This was a privately owned interstate electric
commuter system then linking Manhattan, Newark, and
Hoboken through the Hudson tubes. It had been in reorganization for many years, and in 1959 the Bankruptcy Court
and the United States District Court had approved a plan that
left it with cash sufficient to continue operations for two years
but with no funds for capital expenditures. In re Hudson &
Manhattan R. Co., 174 F Supp. 148 (SDNY 1959), aff'd sub
nom. Spitzer v Sthchman, 278 F 2d 402 (CA2 1960) A
special committee of the New Jersey Senate was formed to
determine whether the Port Authority was "fulfilling its statutory duties and obligations," App. 605a. The committee concluded that the solution to bondholder concern was "[I] imiting
by a constitutionally protected statutory covenant with
Port Authority bondholders the extent to which the Port
Authority revenues and reserves pledged to such bondholders
can in the future be applied to the deficits of possible future
Port Authority passenger railroad facilities beyond the original Hudson & Manhattan Railroad system." Id., at 656a.
And the trial court found that the 1962 New Jersey Legislature "concluded it was necessary to place a limitation on mass
transit deficit operations to be undertaken by the Authority in
the future so as to promote continued investor confidence in
the Authority" 134 N. J Super., at 178, 338 A. 2d, at 863864.
The statutory covenant of 1962 was the result. The covenant itself was part of the bistate legislation authorizing the
Port Authority to acquire, construct, and operate the Hudson
& Manhattan Railroad and the World Trade Center. The
statute in relevant part read.
"The 2 States covenant and agree with each other and

with the holders of any affected bonds, as hereinafter
defined, that so long as any of such bonds remain outstanding and unpaid and the holders thereof shall not
have given their consent as provided in their contract
with the port authority, (a)
and (b) neither the
States nor the port authority nor any subsidiary corporation incorporated for any of the purposes of this act will
apply any of the rentals, tolls, fares, fees, charges, revenues or reserves, which have been or shall be pledged in
whole or in part as security for such bonds, for any railroad purposes whatsoever other than permitted purposes
hereinafter set forth." 1962 N. J Laws, c. 8, § 6, 1962
N. Y Laws, c. 209, § 6
The "permitted purposes" were defined to include (i) the
Hudson & Manhattan as then existing, (ii) railroad freight
facilities, (iii) tracks and related facilities on Port Authority
vehicular bridges, and (iv) a passenger railroad facility if the
Port Authority certified that it was "self-supporting" or, if
not, that at the end of the preceding calendar year the general
reserve fund contained the prescribed statutory amount, and
that all the Port Authority's passenger revenues, including
the Hudson & Manhattan, would not produce deficits in excess of "permitted deficits."
A passenger railroad would be deemed "self-supporting" if
the amount estimated by the Authority as average annual
net income equaled or exceeded the average annual debt service for the following decade. Though the covenant was not
explicit on the point, the States, the Port Authority, and its
bond counsel have agreed that any state subsidy might be
included in the computation of average annual net income of
the facility
9Not at issue in the instant case is part (a) of § 6 of the statutory
covenant (omitted in the quoted material in the text), which promises

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY

Opinion of the Court
"Permtted deficits," the alternative method under permitted purpose (iv), was defined to mean that the annual
estimated deficit, including debt service, of the Hudson tubes
and any additional non-self-sustaining railroad facility could
not exceed one-tenth of the general reserve fund, or 1% of
the Port Authority's total bonded debt.
The terms of the covenant were self-evident. Within its
conditions the covenant permitted, and perhaps even contemplated, additional Port Authority involvement in deficit rail
mass transit as its financial position strengthened, since the
limitation of the covenant was linked to, and would expand
with, the general reserve fund.
A constitutional attack on the legislation containing the
covenant was promptly launched. New Jersey and New
York joined in the defense. The attack proved unsuccessful.

With the legislation embracing the covenant thus effective,
the Port Authority on September 1, 1962, assumed the ownership and operating responsibilities of the Hudson & Manhattan through a wholly owned subsidiary, Port Authority
Trans-Hudson Corporation (PATH) Funds necessary for
this were realized by the successful sale of bonds to private
investors accompanied by the certification required by § 7 of
the Consolidated Bond Resolution that the operation would
not materially impair the credit standing of the Port Authority, the investment status of the Consolidated Bonds, or the
ability of the Port Authority to fulfill its commitments to
bondholders. This § 7 certification was based on a projection
that the States will not impair the Port Authority's control over its fees
or services. This provision has not been repealed, even prospectively

that the annual net loss of the PATH system would level off
at about $6.6 million from 1969 to 1991. At the time the
certification was made the general reserve fund contained
$69 million, and thus the projected PATH deficit was close
to the level of "permitted deficits" under the 1962 covenant.
134 N. J Super., at 163, and n. 27, 338 A. 2d, at 855, and n. 27
The PATH fare in 1962 was 30 cents and has remained at
that figure despite recommendations for increase. App. 684a686a. As a result of the continuation of the low fare, PATH
deficits have far exceeded the initial projection. Thus, although the general reserve fund had grown to $173 million by
1973, substantially increasing the level of permitted deficits
to about $17 million, the PATH deficit had grown to $24.9
million. In accordance with a stipulation of the parties, id., at
682a-683a, the trial court found that the PATH deficit so exceeded the covenant's level of permitted deficits that the Port
Authority was unable to issue bonds for any new passenger
railroad facility that was not self-supporting. 134 N. J

mits use of Port Authority revenues for mass transit if 60% of the bondholders give their consent. The procedures for obtaining such consent
are provided in § 16 (b) of the Consolidated Bond Resolution. App. 802a809a. The Port Authority commissioned a study by First Boston Corporation in 1971 that proposed placing a surcharge on bridge and tunnel tolls,
with the extra revenues going to a special fund to secure bonds for mass
transportation projects. This proposal would not have diminished the
historic reserves pledged to secure the bonds. The study concluded, however, that some increase in the interest rates of existing bonds would have
been necessary to obtain a favorable vote of the bondholders. Id., at
696a-699a. There is some evidence in the record that such a proposal
could not win bondholder approval, partly because the requisite procedures
are unwieldy Id., at 191a-192a.

plan for expansion of the PATH system. This included the
initiation of direct rail service to Kennedy Airport and the
construction of a line to Plainfield, N. J., by way of Newark
Airport. The plan anticipated a Port Authority investment
of something less than $300 million out of a projected total
cost of $650 million, with the difference to be supplied by
federal and state grants. It also proposed to make the covenant inapplicable with respect to bonds issued after the legislation went into effect. This program was enacted, effective
May 10, 1973, and the 1962 covenant was thereby rendered
inapplicable, or in effect repealed, with respect to bonds issued subsequent to the effective date of the new legislation.

G. Retroactive Repeal of the Covenant. It soon developed
that the proposed PATH expansion would not take place as
contemplated in the Governors' 1972 plan. New Jersey was
unwilling to increase its financial commitment in response to
a sharp increase in the projected cost of constructing the
Plainfield extension. As a result the anticipated federal grant
was not approved. App. 717a.
New Jersey had previously prevented outright repeal of the
1962 covenant, but its attitude changed with the election of a
new Governor in 1973. In early 1974, when bills were pending in the two States' legislatures to repeal the covenant

after March 27, 1962 (the effective date of the 1962 covenant legislation)
but prior to the effective date of this act." Id., at 707a.
Earlier in 1972 the New York Legislature had enacted, and the Governor had signed, a bill repealing the 1962 covenant in its entirety 1972
N. Y. Laws, c. 1003. New Jersey did not adopt the necessary complementary legislation at that time. The 1973 amendment to the New York
legislation, noted in the text, was then enacted to conform to the New

is the province of the courts to decide questions of constitutionality, I will
not prevent the covenant issue from being brought before them, especially
where it is the unanimously expressed desire of the members of both
houses of the New York State Legislature as well as the expressed will of
the Governor and both houses of the Legislature of the State of New Jersey to do so." App. 774a.

Opinion of the Court

this Court involving the Contract Clause are evidence of its
important place in our constitutional jurisprudence. Over the
last century, however, the Fourteenth Amendment has assumed a far larger place in constitutional adjudication concerning the States. We feel that the present role of the
Contract Clause is largely illuminated by two of this Court's
decisions. In each, legislation was sustained despite a claim
that it had impaired the obligations of contracts.
Home Building & Loan Assn. v Blatsdell, 290 U S. 398
(1934), is regarded as the leading case in the modern era of
Contract Clause interpretation. At issue was the Minnesota
Mortgage Moratorium Law, enacted in 1933, during the depth
of the Depression and when that State was under severe economic stress, and appeared to have no effective alternative.
The statute was a temporary measure that allowed judicial
extension of the time for redemption, a mortgagor who remained in possession during the extension period was required
to pay a reasonable income or rental value to the mortgagee.
A closely divided Court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice
Hughes, observed that "emergency may furnish the occasion
for the exercise of power" and that the "constitutional question presented in the light of an emergency is whether the
power possessed embraces the particular exercise of it in
response to particular conditions." Id., at 426. It noted
that the debates in the Constitutional Convention were of
little aid in the construction of the Contract Clause, but
that the general purpose of the Clause was clear- to encourage trade and credit by promoting confidence in the
stability of contractual obligations. Id., at 427-428. Nevertheless, a State "continues to possess authority to safeguard

This Court's most recent Contract Clause decision is El

a 1941 Texas statute that limited to a 5-year period the
reinstatement rights of an interest-defaulting purchaser of
land from the State. For many years prior to the enactment
of that statute, such a defaulting purchaser, under Texas law,
could have reinstated his claim to the land upon written request and payment of delinquent interest, unless rights of
third parties had intervened. This Court held that "it is not

The Court recognized
Hahn, 326 U S. 230, 232-233 (1945)
that "the power of a State to modify or affect the obligation of
contract is not without limit," but held that "the objects of
the Texas statute make abundantly clear that it impairs no
protected right under the Contract Clause." 379 U S., at 509.
Both of these cases eschewed a rigid application of the
Contract Clause to invalidate state legislation. Yet neither
indicated that the Contract Clause was without meaning in
modern constitutional jurisprudence, or that its limitation on
state power was illusory Whether or not the protection of
contract rights comports with current views of wise public
policy, the Contract Clause remains a part of our written
Constitution. We therefore must attempt to apply that
constitutional provision to the instant case with due respect
for its purpose and the prior decisions of this Court.

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY
Opinion of the Court

III

We first examine appellant's general claim that repeal of
the 1962 covenant impaired the obligation of the States' contract with the bondholders. It long has been established
that the Contract Clause limits the power of the States to
modify their own contracts as well as to regulate those between private parties. Fletcherv Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 137-139
(1810), Dartmouth College v Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518
(1819)
Yet the Contract Clause does not prohibit the States
from repealing or amending statutes generally, or from enacting legislation with retroactive effects. 3 Thus, as a preliminary matter, appellant's claim requires a determination
that the repeal has the effect of impairing a contractual
obligation.
In this case the obligation was itself created by a statute,
the 1962 legislative covenant. It is unnecessary, however,
to dwell on the criteria for determining whether state legislation gives rise to a contractual obligation."4 The trial court
' 3 The Contract Clause is in the phrase of the Constitution which contains the prohibition against any State's enacting a bill of attainder or
ex post facto law Notwithstanding Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's reference to these two other forbidden categories in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch,
at 138-139, it is clear that they limit the powers of the States only with
regard to the imposition of punishment. Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall.
277, 322-326 (1867), Calder v Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390-391 (1798). The
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment generally does not prohibit retrospective civil legislation, unless the consequences are particularly "harsh and oppressive." Welch v Henry, 305 U. S. 134, 147 (1938).
See Usery v Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 14-20 (1976).

and appellees do not deny, that the 1962 covenant constituted
a contract between the two States and the holders of the
Consolidated Bonds issued between 1962 and the 1973 prospective repeal."5 The intent to make a contract is clear
from the statutory language. "The 2 States covenant and
agree with each other and with the holders of any affected
" 1962 N J Laws, c. 8, § 6, 1962 N. Y Laws,
bonds
c. 209, § 6. Moreover, as the chronology set forth above
reveals, the purpose of the covenant was to invoke the constitutional protection of the Contract Clause as security against
repeal. In return for their promise, the States received the
benefit they bargained for- public marketability of Port
Authority bonds to finance construction of the World Trade
Center and acquisition of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad.
We therefore have no doubt that the 1962 covenant has been
properly characterized as a contractual obligation of the two
States.
The parties sharply disagree about the value of the 1962
regarded as forming part of the obligation of contracts made under their
aegis. See n. 17, infra. See generally Hale, The Supreme Court and the
Contract Clause: II, 57 Harv L. Rev 621, 663-670 (1944).
15 Between the enactment of the 1962 covenant and its retrospective
repeal in 1974, the Port Authority issued and sold to the public $1,260
million of Consolidated Bonds. The Fortieth and Forty-first Series, for
which appellant is trustee, were issued after the 1973 prospective repeal
and prior to the retrospective repeal. The holders of those bonds were
not parties to the 1962 covenant, since the States undoubtedly had the
power to repeal the covenant prospectively See Ogden v Saunders, 12
The subsequent bondholders arguably are like
Wheat. 213 (1827)
third-party beneficiaries of the covenant. There is testimony m the
record that they were indirectly protected because the bonds outstanding
at the time of the prospective repeal (in excess of 81 billion) could not
be expected to be retired in the foreseeable future. App. 1105a. We need
not decide whether that indirect relationship supports standing to challenge the retroactive repeal, however. Appellant also sued as a holder of
Consolidated Bonds (some $72 million) issued between 1962 and 1973.
Id., at 56a-57a.

Opinion of the Court

covenant to the bondholders. Appellant claims that after
repeal the secondary market for affected bonds became "thin"
and the price fell in relation to other formerly comparable
bonds. This claim is supported by the trial court's finding
that "immediately following repeal and for a number of
months thereafter the market price for Port Authority bonds
was adversely affected." 134 N. J Super., at 180, 338 A. 2d,
at 865. Appellees respond that the bonds nevertheless retained an "A" rating from the leading evaluating services and
that after an initial adverse effect they regained a comparable
price position in the market. Findings of the trial court
support these claims as well. Id., at 179-182, 338 A. 2d, at
864-866. The fact is that no one can be sure precisely how
much financial loss the bondholders suffered. Factors unrelated to repeal may have influenced price. In addition, the
market may not have reacted fully, even as yet, to the covenant's repeal, because of the pending litigation and the
possibility that the repeal would be nullified by the courts.
In any event, the question of valuation need not be resolved
in the instant case because the State has made no effort to
compensate the bondholders for any loss sustained by the
repeal. 6 As a security provision, the covenant was not superfluous, it limited the Port Authority's deficits and thus protected the general reserve fund from depletion. Nor was
the covenant merely modified or replaced by an arguably
comparable security provision. Its outright repeal totally
eliminated an important security provision and thus impaired
the obligation of the States' contract. See Rzchmond Mortgage & Loan Corp. v Wachowia Bank & Trust Co., 300 U S.
124, 128-129 (1937) 17

17 The obligations of a contract long have been regarded as including
not only the express terms but also the contemporaneous state law per-

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion of the Court

431 U. S.

The trial court recognized that there was an impairment
in this case "To the extent that the repeal of the covenant
authorizes the Authority to assume greater deficits for such
taining to interpretation and enforcement. "This Court has said that
'the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract, and where it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it,
as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.'"
Home Building & Loan Assn. v Blaisdell, 290 U S.398, 429-430 (1934),
quoting Von Hoffman v City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535, 550 (1867)
See
also Ogden v Saunders, 12 Wheat., at 259-260, 297-298 (opinions of
Washington and Thompson, JJ.) This principle presumes that contracting parties adopt the terms of their bargain m reliance on the law in effect
at the time the agreement is reached.
It is not always unconstitutional, however, for changes m statutory
remedies to affect pre-existing contracts. During the early years when
the Contract Clause was regarded as an absolute bar to any impairment,
this result was reached by treating remedies in a manner distinct from
substantive contract obligations. Thus, for example, a State could abolish
imprisonment for debt because elimnation of this remedy did not impair
the underlying obligation. Penniman's Case, 103 U S. 714 (1881),
Mason v Haile, 12 Wheat. 370 (1827), see Sturges v Crowninshield, 4
Wheat. 122, 200-201 (1819)
Yet it was also recognized very early that the distinction between
remedies and obligations was not absolute. Impairment of a remedy was
held to be unconstitutional if it effectively reduced the value of substantive contract rights. Green v Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1, 75-76, 84-85
(1823). See also Bronson v Kinzie, 1 How 311, 315-318 (1843), Von
Hoffman v City of Quincy, 4 Wall., at 552-554. More recent decisions
have not relied on the remedy/obligation distinction, primarily because it
is now recognized that obligations as well as remedies may be modified
without necessarily violating the Contract Clause. El Paso v Simmons,
379 U S., at 506-507, and n. 9; Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell,
290 U. S., at 429-435.
Although now largely an outdated formalism, the remedy/obligation
distinction may be viewed as approximating the result of a more particularized inquiry into the legitimate expectations of the contracting parties.
The parties may rely on the continued existence of adequate statutory
remedies for enforcing their agreement, but they are unlikely to expect
that state law will remain entirely static. Thus, a reasonable modification of statutes governing contract remedies is much less likely to upset

purposes, it permits a diminution of the pledged revenues
and reserves and may be said to constitute an impairment of
the states' contract with the bondholders." 134 N. J Super.,
at 183, 338 A. 2d, at 866.
Having thus established that the repeal unpaired a contractual obligation of the States, we turn to the question
whether that impairment violated the Contract Clause.
IV
Although the Contract Clause appears literally to proscribe
Cany" impairment, this Court observed in Blaisdell that "the
prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with
literal exactness like a mathematical formula." 290 U S.,
at 428. Thus, a finding that there has been a technical impairment is merely a preliminary step in resolving the more
difficult question whether that impairment is permitted under
the Constitution. In the instant case, as in Blaisdell, we
must attempt to reconcile the strictures of the Contract Clause
with the "essential attributes of sovereign power," id., at 435,
necessarily reserved by the States to safeguard the welfare
of their citizens. Id., at 434-440.
The trial court concluded that repeal of the 1962 covenant
was a valid exercise of New Jersey's police power because
repeal served important public interests in mass transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection. 134
N. J Super., at 194-195, 338 A. 2d, at 873. Yet the Contract
Clause limits otherwise legitimate exercises of state legislative authority, and the existence of an important public
interest is not always sufficient to overcome that limitation.
"Undoubtedly, whatever is reserved of state power must be
consistent with the fair intent of the constitutional limitation
of that power." Blaisdell, 290 U S., at 439. Moreover, the
expectations than a law adjusting the express terms of an agreement. In
this respect, the repeal of the 1962 covenant is to be seen as a serious disruption of the bondholders' expectations.

scope of the State's reserved power depends on the nature of
the contractual relationship with which the challenged law
conflicts.
The States must possess broad power to adopt general
regulatory measures without being concerned that private
contracts will be impaired, or even destroyed, as a result.
Otherwise, one would be able to obtain inmunity from state
regulation by making private contractual arrangements. This
principle is summarized in Mr. Justice Holmes' well-known
dictum. "One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to
state restriction, cannot remove them from the power of the
State by making a contract about them." Hudson Water Co.
v McCarter,209 U S. 349, 357 (1908) Is
Yet private contracts are not subject to unlimited modification under the police power. The Court in Blassdell recognized that laws intended to regulate existing contractual relationships must serve a legitimate public purpose. 290 U S.,
at 444-445. A State could not "adopt as its policy the
repudiation of debts or the destruction of contracts or the
denial of means to enforce them." Id., at 439. Legislation
adjusting the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties
must be upon reasonable conditions and of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying its adoption. Id., at
445-447 19 As is customary in reviewing economic and social

19 Blasdell suggested further limitations that have since been subsumed
m the overall determination of reasonableness. The legislation sustained
m Blasdell was adopted pursuant to a declared emergency in the State
and strictly limited m duration. Subsequent decisions struck down state
laws that were not so limited. W B. Worthen Co. v Thomas, 292 U. S.

or need"), Treigle v Acme Homestead Assn., 297 U. S. 189, 195 (1936)

limitations as absolute requirements. Vezx v Sixth Ward Building &

regulation, however, courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular
measure. East New York Sawngs Bank v Hahn, 326 U S.
230 (1945)
When a State impairs the obligation of its own contract, the
reserved-powers doctrine has a different basis. The initial
inquiry concerns the ability of the State to enter into an
agreement that limits its power to act in the future. As early
as Fletcher v Peck, the Court considered the argument that
"one legislature cannot abridge the powers of a succeeding
legislature." 6 Cranch, at 135. It is often stated that "the
legislature cannot bargain away the police power of a State."
Stone v Missmssippb, 101 U S. 814, 817 (1880) 20 This doctrine requires a determination of the State's power to create
irrevocable contract rights in the first place, rather than an
inquiry into the purpose or reasonableness of the subsequent
impairment. In short, the Contract Clause does not require
a State to adhere to a contract that surrenders an essential
attribute of its sovereignty
In deciding whether a State's contract was invalid ab initwo
under the reserved-powers doctrine, earlier decisions relied on
distinctions among the various powers of the State. Thus, the
Loan Assn., 310 U. S., 32, 39-40 (1940) (emergency need not be declared
and relief measure need not be temporary), East New York Savings
Bank v Hahn, 326 U. S. 230 (1945) (approving 10th extension of oneyear mortgage moratorium). Undoubtedly the existence of an emergency
and the limited duration of a relief measure are factors to be assessed m
determining the reasonableness of an impairment, but they cannot be
regarded as essential m every case.
20Stone v. Mississippi sustained the State's revocation of a 25-year
charter to operate a lottery Other cases similarly have held that a State
is without power to enter into binding contracts not to exercise its police
power in the future. E. g., Pierce Oil Corp. v. City of Hope, 248 U. S.
498, 501 (1919), Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v Goldsboro, 232 U. S. 548,
558 (1914), Douglas v. Kentucky, 168 U S. 488, 502-505 (1897). See
Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S., at 436-437

OCTOBER TERM, 1976

431 U. S.

police power and the power of eminent domain were among
those that could not be "contracted away," but the State could
bind itself in the future exercise of the taxing and spending
powers.21 Such formalistic distinctions perhaps cannot be
dispositive, but they contain an important element of truth.
Whatever the propriety of a State's binding itself to a future
course of conduct in other contexts, the power to enter into
effective financial contracts cannot be questioned. Any financial obligation could be regarded in theory as a relinquishment of the State's spending power, since money spent to
repay debts is not available for other purposes. Similarly,
the taxing power may have to be exercised if debts are to be
repaid. Notwithstanding these effects, the Court has regularly held that the States are bound by their debt contracts.22
The instant case involves a financial obligation and thus as
a threshold matter may not be said automatically to fall
In New Jersey v Wilson, 7 Cranch 164 (1812), the Court held that a
State could properly grant a permanent tax exemption and that the Contract Clause prohibited any impairment of such an agreement. This holding has never been repudiated, although tax exemption contracts generally
have not received a sympathetic construction. See B. Wright, The Contract Clause of the Constitution 179-194 (1938)
By contrast, the doctrine that a State cannot contract away the power
of eminent domain has been established since West River Bridge Co. v
Dix, 6 How 507 (1848)
See Contributors to Pennsylvania Hospital v
Philadelphza, 245 U. S., at 23-24. The doctrine that a State cannot bE
bound to a contract forbidding the exercise of its police power is almost
as old. See n. 20, supra.
2 State laws authorizing the impairment of municipal bond contracts
have been held unconstitutional. W B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, 295
U S. 56 (1935), Louisiana v Pilsbury, 105 U S. 278 (1882). Similarly,
a tax on municipal bonds was held unconstitutional because its effect was
to reduce the contractual rate of interest. Murray v. Charleston, 96 U. S.
432, 443-446 (1878).
A number of cases have held that a State may not authorize a municipality to borrow money and then restrict its taxing power so that the debt
cannot be repaid. Louisiana ex rdl. Hubert v New Orleans, 215 U S.
170, 175-178 (1909), Wolff v. New Orleans, 103 U. S. 358, 365-368 (1881),

Opinion of the Court

within the reserved powers that cannot be contracted away 2
Not every security provision, however, is necessarily financial.
For example, a revenue bond might be secured by the State's
promise to continue operating the facility in question, yet
such a promise surely could not validly be construed to bind
the State never to close the facility for health or safety reasons. The security provision at issue here, however, is different: The States promised that revenues and reserves securing the bonds would not be depleted by the Port Authority's
operation of deficit-producing passenger railroads beyond the
level of "permitted deficits." Such a promise is purely financml and thus not necessarily a compromise of the State's
reserved powers.
Of course, to say that the financial restrictions of the 1962
covenant were valid when adopted does not finally resolve this
case. The Contract Clause is not an absolute bar to subsequent modification of a State's own financial obligations."'
As with laws impairing the obligations of private contracts,
an impairment may be constitutional if it is reasonable and
necessary to serve an important public purpose. In applying

to repay it with interest, are not acting as sovereignties. They come down
to the level of ordinary individuals. Their contracts have the same
meaning as that of similar contracts between private persons. Hence,
instead of there being in the undertaking of a State or city to pay, a
reservation of a sovereign right to withhold payment, the contract should
be regarded as an assurance that such a right will not be exercised. A
promise to pay, with a reserved right to deny or change the effect of the
promise, is an absurdity" Murray v Charleston, 96 U. S., at 445.

this standard, however, complete deference to a legislative
assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate
because the State's self-interest is at stake. A governmental
entity can always find a use for extra money, especially when
taxes do not have to be raised. If a State could reduce its
financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money
for what it regarded as an important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all. 5
The trial court recognized to an extent the special status
of a State's financial obligations when it held that total repudiation, presumably for even a worthwhile public purpose,
would be unconstitutional. But the trial court regarded the
protection of the Contract Clause as available only in such an
extreme case "The states' inherent power to protect the public welfare may be validly exercised under the Contract Clause
even if it impairs a contractual obligation so long as it does
not destroy it." 134 N. J Super., at 190, 338 A. 2d, at
870-871.
The trial court's "total destruction" test is based on what
we think is a misreading of W B Worthen Co. v Kavanaugh,
295 U S. 56 (1935) :! In the first place, the impairment held

unconstitutional in Kavanaugh was one that affected the
value of a security provision, and certainly not every bond
would have been worthless. More importantly, Mr. Justice
Cardozo needed only to state an "outermost limits" test in
the Court's opinion, zd., at 60, because the impairment was
so egregious. He expressly recognized that the actual line
between permissible and impermissible impairments could
well be drawn more narrowly Thus the trial court was not
correct when it drew the negative inference that any impairment less oppressive than the one in Kavanaugh was necessarily constitutional. The extent of impairment is certainly
a relevant factor in deterrminig its reasonableness. But we
cannot sustain the repeal of the 1962 covenant simply because
the bondholders' rights were not totally destroyed.
The only time in this century that alteration of a municipal
bond contract has been sustained by this Court was in Faitoute
Iron & Steel Co. v City of Asbury Park, 316 U S. 502 (1942)
That case involved the New Jersey Municipal Finance Act,
which provided that a bankrupt local government could be
placed in receivership by a state agency A plan for the composition of, creditors' claims was required to be approved by
the agency, the municipality, and 85% in amount of the
creditors. The plan would be binding on nonconsenting creditors after a state court conducted a hearing and found that
the municipality could not otherwise pay off its creditors and
that the plan was in the best interest of all creditors. Id., at

have contract rights in the previous statutory scheme. Without classifying
the enforcement statutes as substantive or remedial, the Court held the
change unconstitutional because it "[took] from the mortgage the quality
of an acceptable investment for a rational investor." 295 U. S., at 60. In
the instant case the State has repudiated an express promise rather than
one implied from the statutory scheme in effect at the time of the contract.
Thus, the instant case may be regarded as a more serious abrogation of
the bondholders' expectations than occurred in Kavanaugh. See n. 17,
supra.

431 U. S.

Under the specific composition plan at issue in Faitoute,the
holders of revenue bonds received new securities bearing lower
interest rates and later maturity dates. This Court, however,
rejected the dissenting bondholders' Contract Clause objections. The reason was that the old bonds represented only
theoretical rights, as a practical matter the city could not
raise its taxes enough to pay off its creditors under the old
contract terms. The composition plan enabled the city to
meet its financial obligations more effectively "The necessity compelled by unexpected financial conditions to modify an
original arrangement for discharging a city's debt is implied
in every such obligation for the very reason that thereby the
obligation is discharged, not impaired." Id., at 511. Thus,
the Court found that the composition plan was adopted with
the purpose and effect of protecting the creditors, as evidenced
by their more than 85% approval. Indeed, the market value
of the bonds increased sharply as a result of the plan's adoption. Id., at 513.
It is clear that the instant case involves a much more serious impairment than occurred in Faitoute. No one has suggested here that the States acted for the purpose of benefiting
the bondholders, and there is no serious contention that the
value of the bonds was enhanced by repeal of the 1962 covenant. Appellees recognized that it would have been impracticable to obtain consent of the bondholders for such a change
in the 1962 covenant, Brief for Appellees 97-98, even though
only 60% approval would have been adequate. See n. 10,
supra. We therefore conclude that repeal of the 1962 covenant cannot be sustained on the basis of this Court's prior
decisions in Faitoute and other municipal bond cases.
V
Mass transportation, energy conservation, and environmental protection are goals that are important and of legitimate
public concern. Appellees contend that these goals are so

Opinion of the Court

important that any harm to bondholders from repeal of the
1962 covenant is greatly outweighed by the public benefit.
We do not accept this invitation to engage in a utilitarian
comparison of public benefit and private loss. Contrary to
Mr. Justice Black's fear, expressed in sole dissent in El Paso
v Simmons, 379 U S., at 517, the Court has not "balanced
away" the limitation on state action imposed by the Contract
Clause. Thus a State cannot refuse to meet its legitimate
financial obligations simply because it would prefer to spend
the money to promote the public good rather than the private
welfare of its creditors. We can only sustain the repeal of
the 1962 covenant if that impairment was both reasonable
and necessary to serve the admittedly important purposes
claimed by the State.
The more specific justification offered for the repeal of the
1962 covenant was the States' plan for encouraging users of
private automobiles to shift to public transportation. The
States intended to discourage private automobile use by raising bridge and tunnel tolls and to use the extra revenue from
those tolls to subsidize improved commuter railroad service.
Appellees contend that repeal of the 1962 covenant was necessary to implement this plan because the new mass transit
facilities could not possibly be self-supporting and the covenant's "permitted deficits" level had already been exceeded.
We reject this justification because the repeal was neither
necessary to achievement of the plan nor reasonable in light
of the circumstances.
The determination of necessity can be considered on two
levels. First, it cannot be said that total repeal of the covThe dissent suggests, post, at 41-44, that such careful scrutiny is unwarranted in this case because the harm to bondholders is relatively small.
For the same reason, however, contractual obligations of this magnitude
need not impose barriers to changes in public policy The States remain
free to exercise their powers of eminent domain to abrogate such contractual rights, upon payment of just compensation. See n. 16, supra.

enant was essential, a less drastic modification would have
permitted the contemplated plan without entirely removing
the covenant's limitations on the use of Port Authority revenues and reserves to subsidize commuter railroads." Second,
without modifying the covenant at all, the States could have
adopted alternative means of achieving their twin goals of
discouraging automobile use and improving mass transit.2 9
Appellees contend, however, that choosing among these alternatives is a matter for legislative discretion. But a
State is not completely free to consider impairing the obliga28

m fact the States sought to divert only new revenues to subsidize
mass transit, then the covenant could have been amended to exclude the
additional bridge and tunnel tolls from the revenue use limitation that was
imposed. Such a change would not have reduced the covenant to a
nullity because it would have continued to prevent the diminution of revenues and reserves that historically secured the bonds. And even if the
plan contemplated use of current revenues and reserves, the formula for
computing "permitted deficits" perhaps could have been modified without
totally abandoning an objective limitation on the Port Authority's involvement in deficit mass transit. Finally, the procedures for obtaining bondholder approval could have been modified so that such consent would
present a feasible means of undertaking new projects. See n. 10, supra.
Of course, we express no opinion as to whether any of these lesser
impairments would be constitutional.
29 Transportation control strategies are available that do not require
direct application of revenues from bridge and tunnel tolls to subsidize
mass transit. In calling for air pollution abatement measures in New
Jersey, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency encouraged "close examination" of such measures as, nter alia, "State taxes
to encourage VMT [vehicle miles traveled] reductions while raising
revenues to benefit mass transit" and realignment of toll structures by
"elimination of commuter discounts" and "possibly an increase in tolls
during peak commuting times to encourage carpools." 38 Fed. Reg.
31389 (1973)
Thus, the States could discourage automobile use through
taxes on gasoline or parking, for example, and use the revenues to subsidize mass transit projects so they would be "self-supporting" within the
meaning of the covenant. Bridge and tunnel tolls could be increased for
commuters and decreased at other times, so that there would be no excess
revenue for purposes of the General Bridge Act of 1946, 33 U. S. C. § 526.
If

tions of its own contracts on a par with other policy alternatives. Similarly, a State is not free to impose a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would
serve its purposes equally well. In El Paso v Simmons,
supra, the imposition of a five-year statute of limitations on
what was previously a perpetual right of redemption was regarded by this Court as "quite clearly necessary" to achieve
the State's vital interest in the orderly administration of its
school lands program. 379 U S., at 515-516. In the instant case the State has failed to demonstrate that repeal of
the 1962 covenant was similarly necessary
We also cannot conclude that repeal of the covenant was
reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances. In this
regard a comparison with El Paso v Simmons, supra, again
is instructive. There a 19th century statute had effects
that were unforeseen and unintended by the legislature when
originally adopted. As a result speculators were placed in
a position to obtain windfall benefits. The Court held that
adoption of a statute of limitation was a reasonable means to
"restrict a party to those gains reasonably to be expected from
the contract" when it was adopted. 379 U S., at 515."
By contrast, in the instant case the need for mass transportation in the New York metropolitan area was not a new development, and the likelihood that publicly owned commuter
railroads would produce substantial deficits was well known.
As early as 1922, over a half century ago, there were pressures
to involve the Port Authority in mass transit. It was with
30 Thi Court previously has regarded the elimination of unforeseen
windfall benefits as a reasonable basis for sustaining changes in statutory
deficiency judgment procedures. These changes were adopted by several
States when unexpected reductions in property values during the Depression permitted some mortgagees to recover far more than their legitimate
entitlement. See Gelfert v National City Bank, 313 U. S. 221, 233-235
(1941), Honeyman v Jacobs, 306 U. S. 539, 542-543 (1939), Richmond
Mortgage & Loan Corp. v. Wachova Bank & Trust Co., 300 U. S. 124,

full knowledge of these concerns that the 1962 covenant was
adopted. Indeed, the covenant was specifically intended to
protect the pledged revenues and reserves against the possibility that such concerns would lead the Port Authority into
greater involvement in deficit mass transit.
During the 12-year period between adoption of the covenant and its repeal, public perception of the importance of
mass transit undoubtedly grew because of increased general
concern with environmental protection and energy conservation. But these concerns were not unknown in 1962, and the
subsequent changes were of degree and not of kind. We cannot say that these changes caused the covenant to have a
substantially different impact in 1974 than when it was
adopted in 1962. And we cannot conclude that the repeal
was reasonable in the light of changed circumstances.
We the'refore hold that the Contract Clause of the United
States Constitution prohibits the retroactive repeal of the
1962 covenant. The judgment of the Supreme Court of New
Jersey is reversed.

In my view, to repeal the 1962 covenant without running
afoul of the constitutional prohibition against the impairment
of contracts, the State must demonstrate that the impairment
was essential to the achievement of an important state purpose. Furthermore, the State must show that it did not know
and could not have known the impact of the contract on that
state interest at the time that the contract was made. So
reading the Court's opinion, I join it.

Decisions of this Court for at least a century have construed the Contract Clause largely to be powerless in binding
a State to contracts limiting the authority of successor legislatures to enact laws in furtherance of the health, safety, and
similar collective interests of the polity In short, those
decisions established the principle that lawful exercises of
a State's police powers stand paramount to private rights
held under contract. Today's decision, in invalidating the
New Jersey Legislature's 1974 repeal of its predecessor's
1962 covenant, rejects this previous understanding and remolds the Contract Clause into a potent instrument for
overseeing important policy determinations of the state
legislature. At the same time, by creating a constitutional
safe haven for property rights embodied in a contract, the
decision substantially distorts modern constitutional jurisprudence governing regulation of private economic interests.
I might understand, though I could not accept, this revival of
the Contract Clause were it in accordance with some coherent
and constructive view of public policy But elevation of the
Clause to the status of regulator of the municipal bond market
at the heavy price of frustration of sound legislative policymaking is as demonstrably unwise as it is unnecessary The
justification for today's decision, therefore, remains a mystery
to me, and I respectfully dissent.
I
The Court holds that New Jersey's repeal of the 1962 covenant constitutes an unreasonable invasion of contract rights
and hence an impairment of contract. The formulation of

the legal standard by which the Court would test asserted
impairments of contracts is, to me, both unprecedented and
most troubling. But because the Constitution primarily is
"'intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to
maintain theories,' " Faitoute Iron & Steel Co. v City of
Asbury Park, 316 U S. 502, 514 (1942), it is necessary to
sketch the factual background of this dispute before discussing
the reasons for my concern. In my view, the Court's casual
consideration both of the substantial public policies that
prompted New Jersey's repeal of the 1962 covenant, and of the
relatively inconsequential burdens that resulted for the Authority's creditors, belies its conclusion that the State acted
unreasonably in seeking to relieve its citizens from the strictures of this earlier legislative policy
A
In an era when problems of municipal planning increasingly
demand regional rather than local solutions, the Port Authority provides the New York-New Jersey community with a
readymade, efficient regional entity encompassing some 1,500
square miles surrounding the Statue of Liberty As the Court
notes, from the outset public officials of both New York and
New Jersey were well aware of the Authority's heavy dependence on public financing. Consequently, beginning in the
decade prior to the enactment of the 1962 covenant, the
Authority's general reserve bonds, its primary vehicle of
public finance, have featured two rigid security devices designed to safeguard the investment of bondholders. First,
pursuant to a so-called "1.3 test," the Authority has been
disabled from issuing new consolidated bonds unless the best
one-year net revenues derived from all of the Authority's facilities at least equal 130% of the prospective debt service for
the calendar year during which the debt service for all outstanding and proposed bonds would be at a maximum.
Second, according to a procedure known as a "section 7 certifi-

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY
1

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

cation," the Authority may not issue bonds to finance additional facilities unless it "shall certify" that the issue "will not,
during the ensuing ten years or during the longest term of any
such bonds proposed to be issued
, whichever shall be
longer,
materially impair the sound credit standing of the
Authority
" App. 811a-812a.
The 1962 covenant existed alongside these security provisions. Viewed in simplest terms, the covenant served to preclude Authority investment and participation in transportation programs by shifting the financial focal point from the
creditworthiness of the Authority's activities as a whole to
the solvency of each proposed new transit project. Whereas
the 1.3 and section 7 tests permit expanded involvement in
mass transportation provided that the enormous revenue-generating potential of the Authority's bridges and tunnels aggregately suffice to secure the investments of creditors, the covenant effectively foreclosed participation in any new project
that was not individually "self-supporting."'I Both parties
to this litigation are in apparent agreement that few functional mass transit systems are capable of satisfying this
requirement.
Whether the 1962 New Jersey Legislature acted wisely in
accepting this new restriction is, for me, quite irrelevant.
What is important is that the passage of the years conclusively
demonstrated that this effective barrier to the development
'-The covenant does enable the Authority to finance passenger railroad
facilities to a level of "permitted deficits," defined as one-tenth of the
General Reserve Fund or 1% of the total bonded indebtedness. While
the Court notes in passing that this provision "permitted, and perhaps
even contemplated, additional Port Authority involvement in deficit rail
mass transit," ante, at 11, the formula restricts the Authority to a small
percentage of the fund, even though aggregate reserves and revenues may
far exceed expenses and creditor claims. In any event, the parties have
stipulated that as a practical matter the Authority has been unable to
expand its involvement in rapid transit by reliance on this alternative
formula. App. 692a.

transit facilities in the State that will make it possible
for more people to use mass transit instead of automobiles." 38 Fed. Reg. 31389 (1973)

The 1962 covenant does not merely bind the Authority's hands for
the decades of the 1960's and 1970's. Rather, the covenant will preclude
the deployment of the Authority's toll revenues to public transit needs
until all the bonds previously issued under the covenant have been retired.

practical matter until the year 2007," Brief for Appellant 24, even if now

further initiatives toward the development of public trans-

portation and similar programs. See ante, at 14.
It was in response to these societal demands that the New
Jersey and New York Legislatures repealed the 1962 covenant.
The trial court found.
"In April 1970 Governors Cahill and Rockefeller announced a joint program to increase the Port Authority's
role in mass transportation by building a rail link to John
F Kennedy International Airport and extending PATH
[a commuter rail line under Authority control] to Newark
International Airport and other parts of New Jersey"
134 N. J Super. 124, 168-169, 338 A. 2d 833, 858 (1975)
But, the court found, this expansion "was not economically
feasible under the terms of the 1962 covenant." Id., at 170,
338 A. 2d, at 859. Consequently, the States repealed the
covenant. On signing the New York legislation, Governor
Rockefeller stated.
"Passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in both
houses of the Legislature, the bill removes the absolute
statutory prohibition against the use of the revenues of
the Port of New York Authority for railroad purposes.
That statutory covenant, together with the provision of
the bi-state compact creating the Authority that neither
State will construct competing facilities within the Port
District, could forever preclude the two states from
undertaking vitally needed mass transportation projects.
In removing the present restriction, the bill would not
jeopardize the security of Port Authority bondholders or
their rights to maintain that security" Quoted ibzd.
In following suit, New Jersey also expressly grounded its
action upon the necessity of overturning "'the restrictions
inposed by the covenant [that] effectively preclude sufficient
port authority participation in the development of a public
transportation system in the port district.'" Id., at 172, 338

A. 2d, at 860. Approximately one year later, on April 10,
1975, the Port Authority announced an increase in bridge and
tunnel tolls amounting to $40 million, the resulting revenue
designed to assist in the financing of passenger transportation
facilities without jeopardizing the reserve fund set aside for
the Authority's creditors.
The Court's consideration of this factual background is, I
believe, most unsatisfactory The Court never explicitly takes
issue with the core of New Jersey's defense of the repeal. that
the State was faced with serious and growing environmental,
energy, and transportation problems, and the covenant worked
at cross-purposes with efforts at remedying these concerns.
Indeed, the Court candidly concedes that the State's purposes
in effectuating the 1974 repeal were "admittedly important."
Ante, at 29. Instead, the Court's analysis focuses upon related, but peripheral, matters.
For example, several hypothetical alternative methods are
proposed whereby New Jersey might hope to secure funding
for public transportation, and these are made the basis for
a holding that repeal of the covenant was not "necessary"
Ante, at 29-31. Setting aside the propriety of this surprising legal standard,3 the Court's effort at fashioning its own
legislative program for New York and New Jersey is notably
unsuccessful. In fact, except for those proffered alternatives
which also amount to a repeal or substantial modification of
the 1962 covenant,4 none of the Court's suggestions is com3See,

e. g., mfra, at 59, and n. 17
See ante, at 30 n. 28. I am puzzled whether the Court really intends
these alternatives to be taken seriously in view of the footnote's closing
reminder that even these "lesser impairments" also may be found to be
unconstitutional. If the Court, in fact, means that New Jersey and New
York could remedy any Contract Clause defects merely by modifying
their repeal of the 1962 covenant so as to limit transit subsidization solely
to future toll increases-the policy that is being followed by the States
m actual practice-then today's decision would be rendered into a temporary formalism.

patible with the basic antipollution and transportation-control
strategies that are crucial to metropolitan New York. As the
Court itself accurately recognizes, the environmental and
transportation program for the New York area rests upon a
two-step campaagn. "The States mten[d] [1] to discourage
private automobile use by raising bridge and tunnel tolls and
[2] to use the extra revenue from those tolls to subsidize
improved commuter railroad service." Ante, at 29. This coordinated two-step strategy has not been arbitrarily or casually created, but is dictated by contemporaneous federal
enactments such as the Clean Air Act,' and stems both from
New York City's unique geographic situation 6 and from longstanding provisions in federal law that require the existence of "reasonable and just" expenses-which may include
diversion to mass transit subsidies-as a precondition to any
The Court's various
increase in interstate bridge tolls.'
5 Cf. Friends of the Earth v Carey, 552 F 2d 25 (CA2 1977),
Friends of the Earth v Carey, 535 F 2d 165 (CA2 1976), Friends of the
Earth v. EPA, 499 F 2d 1118 (CA2 1974).
6 Because cars entering or leaving Manhattan must pass over bridges
or through tunnels, the regulation of tolls offers an unusually convenient
and effective method of discouraging automobile usage m addition to
promising a highly lucrative revenue base.
7
Thus, if toll funds cannot be diverted to rapid transit needs, any mcrease m bridge revenues necessarily would produce an expansion of the
Authority's general reserve fund well beyond that necessary or contem-

plated for the protection of bondholders. Faced with such a mere accumulation of capital, the Federal Highway Administrator, acting under

§ 503 of the General Bridge Act of 1946, 33 U. S. C. § 526, evidently would
be obligated to disallow any toll increases as not "reasonable and just" under
the Act. See generally Delaware River Port Authority v Tiemann, 531
F 2d 699 (CA3 1976). The United States Department of Transportation,
however, has stated that "in some areas (New York, Philadelphia, San
Francisco), bridge toll revenues provide significant support for transit
capital and/or operating costs, thereby providing transit service improvements which promote decreased dependence on automobile travel." App.
726a-727a. The Department has recommended that a diversion of funds

alternative proposals, while perhaps interesting speculations,
simply are not responsive to New York's and New Jersey's
real environmental and traffic problems,8 and, in any event,
intrude the Court deeply into complex and localized policy
matters that are for the States' legislatures and not the
judiciary to resolve.
Equally unconvincing is the Court's contention that repeal
of the 1962 covenant was unreasonable because the environmental and energy concerns that prompted such action "were
not unknown in 1962, and the subsequent changes were of
degree and not of kind." Ante, at 32. Nowhere are we told
why a state policy, no matter how responsive to the general
welfare of its citizens, can be reasonable only if it confronts
issues that previously were absolutely unforeseen.'
Indeed,
to serve rapid transit needs should qualify as "reasonable and just," and,
therefore, would be capable of supporting a general increase in toll revenues. Ibid. This is in stark contrast with the Court's suggested alternative policies outlined ante, at 30 n. 29, which would permit no general
increase in bridge tolls and no coordination of the bridge toll and transit
subsidization strategies that. are central to the antipollution effort in
metropolitan New York, and, therefore, until today, have been considered secondary and inadequate to serve the community's needs.
8 See, e. g., n. 7, supra. In short, all the alternatives that the Court
leaves to the States, ante, at 30 n. 29, deny access to the Authority's
tolls, even though they represent a potentially lucrative revenue source
which can be tapped without injury to the bondholders. See Part B,
infra.

9Indeed, the Court's single-minded emphasis on the existence of changed
circumstances leads it to embrace a rather perverse constellation of values
in which New Jersey's desire to care for the health, environmental, and
energy needs of its citizenry is relegated to lesser importance than the
desire of Texas in El Paso v Simmons, 379 U S. 497 (1965), to deny windfall economic gains to purchasers of school land from the State. Ante, at
31. I, of course, do not dispute the importance of Texas' stake in Simmons. But surely any reasonable ordering of values and social objectives
would compel the conclusion that a State's concern for its citizens' health
and general welfare is far more deserving of this Court's recognition.

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

this arbitrary perspective seems peculiarly inappropriate in
a case like this where at least three new and independent
congressional enactments between the years 1962 and 1974
summoned major urban centers like New York and New
Jersey to action in the environmental, energy, and transportation fields. In short, on this record, I can neither understand nor accept the Court's characterization of New Jersey's
action as unreasonable.
B
If the Court's treatment of New Jersey's legitimate policy
interests is inadequate, its consideration of the countervailing injury ostensibly suffered by the appellant is barely
discernible at all. For the Court apparently holds that a
mere "technical impairment" of contract suffices to subject
New Jersey's repealer to serious judicial scrutiny and invalidation under the Contract Clause. Ante, at 21. The Court's
modest statement of the economic injury that today attracts
its judicial intervention is, however, understandable. For
fairly read, the record before us makes plain that the repeal
of the 1962 covenant has occasioned only the most minimal
damage on the part of the Authority's bondholders.
Obviously, the heart of the obligation to the bondholdersand the interests ostensibly safeguarded by the 1962 covenant-is the periodic payment of interest and the repayment
of principal when due. The Court does not, and indeed cannot,
contend that either New Jersey or the Authority has called
into question the validity of these underlying obligations. No
creditor complains that public authorities have defaulted on a
coupon payment or failed to redeem a bond that has matured.
In fact, the Court does not even offer any reason whatever
for fearing that, as a result of the covenant's repeal, the
securities in appellant's portfolio are jeopardized. Such a
contention cannot be made in the face of the finding of the trial
judge, who, in referring to the increasingly lucrative financial

position of the Authority at the date of the covenant's repeal
in comparison to 1962, concluded.
"Suffice it to say that between 1962 and 1974 the security
afforded bondholders had been substantially augmented
by a vast increase in Authority revenues and reserves,
and the Authority's financial ability to absorb greater
deficits, from whatever source and without any significant
impairment of bondholder security, was correspondingly
increased." 134 N. J Super., at 194-195, 338 A. 2d, at
873.10
By simply ignoring this unchallenged finding concerning the
Authority's overall financial posture, the Court is able to argue
that'the repeal of the 1962 covenant impaired the Authority's
bonds in two particular respects. First, it is suggested that
repeal of the covenant may have adversely affected the secondary market for the securities. Ante, at 19. The Court,
however, acknowledges that appellant has adduced only ambiguous evidence to support this contention, and that the
actual price position of Authority bonds was, at most, only
temporarily affected by the repeal. Ibid." In fact, the trial
The court found: "Between 1961 and 1973 the net revenues of the
Authority increased from $68,000,000 to S137,000,000, and over that
period the Authority had available to it $582,732,000 m excess of its debt
service requirements
Through 1974, the corresponding figures are
$161,283,000 and $649,750,000, respectively" 134 N. J. Super., at 195
n. 43, 338 A. 2d, at 873 n. 43. Thus, both prior to and following the
repeal of the covenant, the Authority's revenues and earned surplus continued their unhampered and overwhelmingly impressive growth.
"lIndeed, one of the anomalous aspects of this suit is the Court's
willingness to invalidate an Act of the State of New Jersey, and indirectly
of New York, while apparently recognizing that if this were an action by
creditors for damages, or an action to fix "just compensation," the trial
court's findings raise serious doubt that any compensable monetary loss
would be found. Ante, at 19. By sidestepping the damages question,
ibid., and by mandating reinstatement of the covenant, the Court manages to burden the Port Authority with an unwanted contract, while
relieving the creditor-appellant of the need to establish any tangible

court also explicitly rejected the ultimate significance of this
alleged injury"The bottom line of plaintiff's proofs on this issue is
simply that the evidence fails to demonstrate that the
secondary market price of Authority bonds was adversely
affected by the repeal of the covenant, except for a shortterm fall-off in price, the effect of which has now been
dissipated insofar as it can be related to the enactment of
the repeal." 134 N. J Super., at 181-182, 338 A. 2d, at
866 (emphasis supplied)
Secondly, repeal of the covenant is said to have canceled
an important security provision enjoyed by the creditors.
Ante, at 19. Of course, there is no question that appellant
prefers the retention to the removal of the covenant, but
surely this alone cannot be an acceptable basis for the Court's
wooden application of the Contract Clause or for its conclusion that the repeal unfairly diminished bondholder security By placing reliance on this superficial allegation of
economic injury, the Court again is able simply to disregard
the trial court's contrary finding that appellant's complaint of
insecurity is without factual merit:
"The claim that bondholder security has been maternally
impaired or destroyed by the repeal is simply not supported by the record. The pledge of the Authority's net
revenues and reserves remains intact, the Authority will
still be barred from the issuance of any new consolidated
bonds unless the 1.3 test required by the CBR is met,
and the Authority will continue to be prohibited from the
economic injury arising from the covenant's repeal. This suggests that
any protection afforded bondholders today may well prove to be purely
illusory Even after the mandate issues, New Jersey, we are told, may
again condemn or repeal the covenant and offer just compensation to its
creditors. See ante, at 29 n. 27 However, in light of the trial court's
factual conclusions, this promise of compensation will entitle bondholders
to little or no financial recovery

by a pledge of the general reserve fund without the certification required by section 7 of the series resolutions,
to wit, that in the opinion of the Authority the estimated
expenditures in connection with any additional facility
for which such bonds are to be issued would not, for the
ensuing ten years, impair the sound credit standing of

bondholders." 134 N. J Super., at 196, 338 A. 2d, at

In brief, only by disregarding the detailed factual findings
of the trial court in a systematic fashion is the Court today
able to maintain that repeal of the 1962 covenant was anything but a minimal interference with the realistic economic
interests of the bondholders. The record in this case fairly
establishes that we are presented with a relatively inconsequential infringement of contract rights in the pursuit of
substantial and important public ends. Yet, this meager
record is seized upon by the Court as the vehicle for resuscitation of long discarded Contract Clause doctrine-a
step out of line with both the history of Contract Clause
jurisprudence and with constitutional doctrine generally in
its attempt to delineate the reach of the lawmaking power
of state legislatures in the face of adverse claims by property
owners.

festly seek to further the legitimate needs of their citizens.
The Court's analysis, I submit, fundamentally misconceives
the nature of the Contract Clause guarantee.
One of the fundamental premises of our popular democracy
is that each generation of representatives can and will remain
responsive to the needs and desires of those whom they
represent. Crucial to this end is the assurance that new
legislators will not automatically be bound by the policies
and undertakings of earlier days. In accordance with this
philosophy, the Framers of our Constitution conceived of the
Contract Clause primarily as protection for economic transactions entered into by purely private parties, rather than
obligations involving the State itself. See G. Gunther, Constitutional Law 604 (1975), B. Schwartz, A Commentary On
the Constitution of the United States, pt. 2, The Rights of
Property 274 (1965), B. Wright, The Contract Clause of the
Constitution 15-16 (1938) 1 The Framers fully recognized
that nothing would so jeopardize the legitimacy of a system
of government that relies upon the ebbs and flows of politics
to "clean out the rascals" than the possibility that those same
rascals might perpetuate their policies simply by locking them
into binding contracts.
Following an early opinion of the Court, however, that
"3One scholar for example, after undertaking extensive research into
the history of the Constitutional Convention, concluded that there is
no evidence that the Constitution's Framers perceived of the Contract
Clause as applicable to public agreements. "[I]t is evident that all of
them discussed the clause only in relation to private contracts, i. e., contracts between individuals." B. Wright, The Contract Clause of the Constitution 15 (1938). Moreover, "[a] careful search has failed to unearth
any other statements even suggesting that the contract clause was intended
to apply to other than private contracts." Id., at 16. Indeed, Professor
Wright found that only two antifederalists, neither of whom was a member
of the Convention, ever suggested that the Clause would support "a
broader meaning" encompassing public contracts, but "their interpretations
were denied by members of the Convention, and the denials were not
challenged." Ibid.

took the first step of applying the Contract Clause to public
undertakings, Fletcher v Peck, 6 Cranch 87 (1810), later
decisions attempted to define the reach of the Clause consistently with the demands of our governing processes. The
central principle developed by these decisions, beginning at
least a century ago, has been that Contract Clause challenges
such as that raised by appellant are to be resolved by according unusual deference to the lawmaking authority of state
and local governments. Especially when the State acts in
furtherance of the variety of broad social interests that came
clustered together under the rubric of "police powers," see E.
Freund, The Police Power (1904)-in particular, matters of
health, safety, and the preservation of natural resourcesthe decisions of this Court pursued a course of steady
return to the intention of the Constitution's Framers by
closely circumscribing the scope of the Contract Clause.
This theme of judicial self-restraint and its underlying
premise that a State always retains the sovereign authority
to legislate in behalf of its people was commonly expressed by
the doctrine that the Contract Clause will not even recognize
efforts of a State to enter into contracts limiting the authority
of succeeding legislators to enact laws in behalf of the health,
safety, and similar collective interests of the polity 4-in
14 Parallel doctrines worked to the same end of freeing the States from
contractual duties allegedly imposed by earlier legislators. For example,
it has long been held that in applying the Contract Clause to government
contracts, every ambiguity and gap is to be strictly construed in behalf of
the State. "[I]n grants by the public, nothing passes by implication."
Charles River Bridge v Warren Bridge, 11 Pet. 420, 546 (1837). "Every
reasonable doubt is to be resolved adversely [to the private party claiming
under the contract]. Nothing is to be taken as conceded but what is
given in unmistakable terms, or by an implication equally clear. The
affirmative must be shown. Silence is negation, and doubt is fatal to the
claim. This doctrine is vital to the public welfare." Fertilizng Co. v
Hyde Park, 97 U. S. 659, 666 (1878)
Along these lines, it is noteworthy that the state law of New Jersey
itself raises serious doubts concerning the reasonableness of appellant's

UNITED STATES TRUST CO. v. NEW JERSEY

BRENNAN,

short, that that State's police power is inalienable by contract.
For example, in Fertilizing Co v Hyde Park, 97 U S. 659

(1878), the Illinois General Assembly granted to a fertilizer
company an 1867 corporate charter to run for 50 years.
The corporation thereafter invested in a factory and depot on
land which it owned within the area designated by.the charter.
Five years later, the village authorities of Hyde Park adopted
an ordinance that rendered the company's charter valueless
reliance on the covenant for permanent protection from later laws enacted
by the state legislature. In a case involving an alleged impairment of a
township's municipal bonds, Hourigan v North Bergen Township, 113
N. J. L. 143, 149, 172 A. 193, 196 (1934), the State's highest court declared:
"It is a well established doctrine that the interdiction of statutes impairing
the obligation of contracts does not prevent the state from exercising such
powers as are vested m it for the promotion of the common weal, or are
necessary for the general good of the public, though contracts entered
into between individuals may thereby be affected. This power, which in
its various ramifications is known as the police power, is an exercise of the
sovereign right of the government to protect the lives, health, morals, comfort and general welfare of the people, and is paramount to any rights
under contracts between individuals. While this power is subject to limitations in certain cases, there is wide discretion on the part of the
legislature in determining what is and what is not necessary-a discretion
which courts ordinarily will not interfere with." In my view, therefore,
appellant should be held to have purchased the Authority's bonds subject
to the knowledge that under New Jersey law the State's obligation was
conditionally undertaken subject to reasonable future legislative action.
The record raises similiar doubts and ambiguities. Thus, State Senator
Farley, who chaired the committee that inquired into the status of the
Authority's bonds prior to enactment of the covenant, noted: "[W]e well
we could not impair any obligation such as contracts of
appreciate that
bond issues. Likewise, you [Commissioner Clancy of the Port Authority] as
a lawyer know that one legislature cannot bind the other involving policy
five, ten, or twenty years hence." App. 89a (emphasis supplied). It
may well be that appellant subjectively believed that the covenant was
unimpeachable under state law But given the doubts and hesitancies
contained m the record, the principles established in earlier cases extending
back to John Marshall should require that such "doubt is fatal to [appellant's] claim." Fertilizing Co., supra, at 666.

by prohibiting the transportation of offal within the village
and forbidding the operation of a fertilizer factory within the
village confines. This Court nonetheless rejected the contention that the new ordinance offended the Contract Clause.

applicable and adequate to give an effectual remedy [to
the nuisance] That power belonged to the States when
the Federal Constitution was adopted. They did not

Pure air and the comfortable enjoyment of property are as much rights belonging to [the village residents]

years from the exercise of the police power of the State,
however serious the nuisance might become in the
future
" Id., at 667, 669, 670.
Two years later, this principle of the Contract Clause's
subservience to the States' broad lawmaking powers was reasserted in another context. In 1867, the Mississippi Legislature entered into a contract with a company whereby the
latter was chartered to operate a lottery within the State "in
consideration of a stipulated sum in cash
" The next
year the State adopted a constitutional provision abolishing
lotteries. The Court once again unhesitantly dismissed a
challenge to this provision grounded on the Contract Clause,
Stone v Mississippi, 101 U S.814, 817-818 (1880)
"'Irrevocable grants of property and franchises may be
made if they do not impair the supreme authority to
make laws for the right government of the State, but no

such laws as they may deem proper in matters of
police'
No one denies
that [this legislative
power] extends to all matters affecting the public health
or the public morals."
Later cases continued to read the Contract Clause as qualified by the States' powers to legislate for the betterment of
their citizens, while further expanding the range of permissible police powers. For example, in Atlantic Coast Line
R. Co. v Goldsboro, 232 U S. 548 (1914), the State chartered
and contracted with the plaintiff railway company to operate
rail lines within the State. Pursuant to this contract, the
railroad acquired in fee land for use as rights-of-way and
similar transportation activities. The Court recognized that
the charter was a binding contract, and that the company, in
reliance on the agreement, had acquired land which it enjoys
as "complete and unqualified" owner. Id., at 556, 558. Yet,
the Court brushed aside a constitutional challenge to subsequent ordinances that greatly circumscribed the railroad's
activities on its own land.
"For it is settled that neither the 'contract' clause nor
the 'due process' clause has the effect of overriding the
power of the State to establish all regulations that are
reasonably necessary to secure the health, safety, good
order, comfort, or general welfare of the community;
that this power can neither be abdicated nor bargained
away, and is inalienable even by express grant, and that
all contract and property rights are held subject to its
fair exercise." Id., at 558.
In perfect conformity with these earlier cases that recognized the States' broad authority to legislate for the welfare
of their citizens, New Jersey and New York sought to repeal
the 1962 covenant in furtherance of "admittedly important'
interests, ante, at 29, in environmental protection, clean air,
and safe and efficient transportation facilities. The States'

In its
disregard of these teachings, the Court treats New Jersey's
social and economic policies with lesser sensitivity than former
Members of this Court who stressed the protection of contract and property rights. Even Mr. Justice Butler recognized
that the Contract Clause does not interfere with state legislative efforts in behalf of its citizens' welfare unless such actions
"are

BRENNAw, J., dissenting

Thus, with at best a passing nod to the long history of
judicial deference to state lawmaking in the face of challenges under the Contract Clause, see ante, at 23 n. 20, the
Court today imposes severe substantive restraints on New
Jersey's attempt to free itself from a contractual provision
that it deems inconsistent with the broader interests of its
citizens. Today's decision cannot be harmonized with our
earlier cases by the simple expedient of labeling the covenant
"purely financial," ante, at 25, rather than a forfeiture of
"an essential attribute of [New Jersey's] sovereignty," ante,
at 23. As either an analytical or practical matter, this distinction is illusory It rests upon an analytical foundation
that has long been discarded as unhelpful. 5 And as a
'5 Among other difficulties, the question-begging attempt to categorize
inviolable legislation powers vis-a-vis the Contract Clause depends upon
a conception of state sovereignty that is both simplistic and unpersuasive.
We are told that the Contract Clause "does not require a State to adhere
to a contract that surrenders an essential attribute of its sovereignty,"
ante, at 23, but in applying this principle, the Court finds that the
States' "taxing and spending powers," unlike the power of eminent domain,
lie outside this rule, ante, at 24. Before today, one might well have supposed that the States' authority to tax, spend money, and generally make
basic financial decisions is among the most important of their governmental powers. Indeed, only last Term, this Court announced that a State's
decision to pay its employees less than the minimum wage-a decision of
far less importance to the citizens generally than efforts to derive funding
for improving the facilities that directly and vitally affect their health and
safety-is immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause, an
authority previously thought to be virtually plenary in nature. The
Court there reasoned that the minimum-wage decision falls within the
sovereign powers of "States qua States." National League of Cities v
Usery, 426 U. S. 833, 847 (1976)
One may rightfully feel unease that
the Court is in the process of developing a concept of state sovereignty
that is marked neither by consistency nor intuitive appeal.
In any event, in addition to resting on a most dubious conception of
sovereignty, the Court's effort to demonstrate that the States are free to
contract away their taxing and spending powers-and hence free "to enter
into effective financial contracts" notwithstanding later exercises of the
police power-must fail because it is untenable. While it is true that

purely practical matter, an interference with state policy
is no less intrusive because a contract prohibits the State from
resorting to the most realistic and effective financial method of
preserving its citizens' legitimate interests in healthy and safe
transportation systems rather than directly proscribing the
States from exercising their police powers in this area. The
day has long since passed when analysis under the Contract
Clause usefully can turn on such formalistic differences. Cf.
Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v

Blaisdell, 290 U

denial of means to enforce them." Home Bldg. & Loan Assn.

not, that the operative consideration for constitutional purposes is not
whether a contract can or cannot be branded as "financial." Rather, m

matters of health, safety, and the like with "studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate

In this regard, the Court merely creates
U S.56, 60 (1935)
its own straw man when it characterizes the choice facing it
today either as adopting its new, expansive view of the scope of
the Contract Clause, or holding that the Clause "would provide
no protection at all." Ante, at 26. The Constitution properly
prohibits New Jersey and all States from disadvantaging their
creditors without reasonable justification or in a spirit of oppression, and New Jersey claims no such prerogatives. But if
a State, as here, manifestly acts in furtherance of its citizens'
general welfare, and its choice of policy, even though infringing contract rights, is not "plainly unreasonable and arbitrary,"

of the Contract Clause in the Constitution. And it is clear that the
Court's citation to Perry v. United States, 294 U. S. 330 (1935), see
ante, at 26 n. 25, offers no support for its rewriting of history In that
case, one of the Gold Clause Cases, Perry challenged the constitution-

stitutional if it is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose."
Ante, at 25. Not only is this
apparently spontaneous formulation virtually assured of frustrating the understanding of court and litigant alike,' but it
ality of a congressional enactment which authorized the redemption of outstanding United States gold bonds by payment of legal tender currency
rather than "'by the payment of 10,000 gold dollars each containing 25.8
grains of gold, .9 fine,'" 294 U S., at 347, the value of the dollar in gold
when the bonds were acquired. Perry complained that inflation had devalued
the worth of legal tender with respect to gold and, therefore, claimed
financial injury by the conversion. The Government defended its actions
on the ground that the gold clause obstructed Congress' express power
to "regulate the Value" of money, Art. I, § 8, and, accordingly, argued
that Congress was free to repudiate the gold standard under that power.
Although Perry ultimately was denied recovery, the Court found that
the authority to "regulate the Value" of money, while permitting Congress
"to control or interdict the contracts of private parties" with regard to
the legal exchange rate, 294 U. S., at 350, did not include the power to
repudiate the Government's own obligations, which were governed by entirely different constitutional provisions: E. g., Congress may "borrow
Money on the credit of the United States," Art. I, § 8, cl. 2, and "The
validity of the public debt of the United States
shall not be questioned," Amdt. 14, § 4. Thus the differential standard in Perry emerged
from the collision of competing grants of power to the Federal Government, and did not purport to suggest that the Contract Clause-or its
federal counterpart, the Fifth Amendment-standing alone would produce
different standards for reviewing governmental interference with public
and private contractual obligations.
17The Court's newly announced standard of review, like all such
formulations, can merely hope to suggest the direction that a court's
inquiry should take, and the relative weight to be afforded a constitutional right. But particular words like "reasonable" and "necessary"
also are fused with special meaning, for judges have long experience in
applying such standards to constitutional contexts. Reasonableness generally has signified the most relaxed regime of judicial inquiry See,
e. g., Dandndge v. Williams, 397 U. S.471, 485 (1970) ("If the classification has some 'reasonable basis,' it does not offend the Constitution").
Contrariwise, the element of necessity traditionally has played a key role
in the most penetrating mode of constitutional review. See e. g., Shapiro

is wholly out of step with the modern attempts of this Court
to define the reach of the Contract Clause when a State's
own contractual obligations are placed in issue.
Mr. Justice Cardozo's opinion in W B Worthen Co. v
Kavanaugh, 295 U S. 56 (1935), is the prime exposition of the
a fundamental constitutional right must be "necessary to promote a
compelling governmental interest"). The Court's new test, therefore,
represents a most unusual hybrid which manages to merge the two polar
extremes of judicial intervention, see generally Gunther, Foreword: In
Search of Evolving Doctrine on A Changing Court: A Model for a Newer
Equal Protection, 86 Harv L. Rev 1, 8 (1972), into one synthesis. Plamly,
courts are apt to face considerable confusion in wielding such a schizophrenic new instrument. And well they might, for until today one
would have fairly thought that as a matter of common sense as well as
doctrine, state policies that are "necessary to serve an important public
purpose." ante, at 25, a fortion would be "reasonable."
The Court, however, seems to discover new meanings in these terms.
"Necessary" appears to comport with some notion of a less restrictive
alternative. As applied by the Court in this instance, however, the less
restrictive alternative bears no relationship to previous uses of that
analytical tool when economic and social matters were involved. Thus,
the Court does not actually inquire whether "the government can achieve
the purposes of the challenged regulation equally effectively by one or
more narrower regulations." Struve, The Less-Restrictive-Alternative
Principle and Economic Due Process, 80 Harv L. Rev 1463 (1967).
Rather, the Court concludes that an impairment of contract was not
"necessary" because the Court apparently is able to hypothesize other
means of achieving some or all of the State's objectives, even though
these alternatives have long been deemed as secondary in importance,
nn. 7, 8, supra, or arguably are unconstitutional, ante, at 30 n. 28.
Under this approach, few, if any, Contract Clause cases in history that
have deferred to state policymaking have been correctly decided. See
znfra, at 59.
The "reasonableness" test does no better. No longer does it mean
that this Court will defer to the "reasonable judgments" of the authorized
policymakers. Knebel v Hem, 429 U. S. 288, 297 (1977). Instead, the
Court appears to ask whether changed circumstances took the state legislature by surprise, ante, at 31-32. Again, I find no basis in this Court's
prior cases for adopting such a constrictive view of that constitutional
test. See nfra, at 59-60.

modern view As a relief measure for financially depressed
local governments, Arkansas enacted a statute that greatly
diminished the remedies available to creditors under their
bonds. This resulted in a remedial scheme whereby creditors
were "without an effective remedy" for a minimum of 61/2
years, during which time the government's obligation to pay
principal or interest was suspended. Id., at 61. The Court
invalidated the alteration in remedies. It did so, however,
only after concluding that the challenged state law cut recklessly and excessively into the value of the creditors' bonds:
"[W]ith studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee
or to his appropriate protection [the State has] taken from the
mortgage the quality of an acceptable investment for a rational
investor." Id., at 60. "So viewed [the State's action is] seen
to be an oppressive and unnecessary destruction of nearly all
the incidents that give attractiveness and value to collateral
security" Id., at 62.
In the present case, the trial court expressly applied the
Kavanaugh standard to New Jersey's repeal of the covenant,
and properly found appellant's claim to be wanting in all
material respects: In a detailed and persuasive discussion, the
court concluded that neither New Jersey nor New York repealed the covenant with the intention of damaging their creditors' financial position. Rather, the States acted out of "vital
interest[s]," for "[t]he passage of time and events between
1962 and 1974 satisfied the Legislatures of the two states that
the public interest which the Port Authority was intended to
serve could not be met within the terms of the covenant."
134 N. J Super., at 194, 338 A. 2d, at 873. And the creditors'
corresponding injury did not even remotely reach that proscribed in Kavanaugh. Not only have Authority bonds remaaned "an 'acceptable investment,'" but "[t]he claim that
bondholder security-has been materially impaired or destroyed
by the repeal is simply not supported by the record." Id., at
196, 338 A. 2d, at 874.

the trial court erred in its application of the facts of this case
to Mr. Justice Cardozo's formulation. Instead, it manages
to take refuge in the fact that Kavanaugh left open the possibility that the test it enunciated may merely represent the
"'outermost limits'" of state authority
Ante, at 27 This, I
submit, is a slender thread upon which to hang a belated revival of the Contract Clause some 40 years later. And, in
any event, whatever opening remained after Kavanaugh was
surely closed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Faitoute Iron &
Steel Co. v City of Asbury Park, 316 U S. 502 (1942)
Speaking for a unanimous Court, id., at 515, he employed the
precise constitutional standard established by Mr. Justice
Cardozo seven years earlier, and upheld under the Contract
Clause a New Jersey plan to reorganize the outstanding debt
obligations held by creditors of Asbury Park. The Court
thereby authorized an impairment of creditors' financial interests that was far more substantial than that involved here.
In fact, the reorganization plan both extended the maturity
date of the city's bonds by some 30 years and reduced the relevant coupon rate. Yet, rather than suggesting, as does the
Court today, that New Jersey possessed lesser authority in the
public interest to amend its own contracts than to alter private
undertakings, the Court made clear that the State's powers are
more expansive
"[w]here
the respective parties are not private persons
but are persons or corporations whose rights
and powers were created for public purposes, by legislative acts, and where the subject-matter of tle contract is
one which affects the safety and welfare of the public."
Id., at 514 n. 2, quoting Chtcago, B & Q. R. Co. v
Nebraska, 170 U S., at 72.
In my view, the fact that New Jersey's repeal of the 1962
covenant satisfies the constitutional standards defined in Kavanaugh and Faitoute should, as the state courts concluded, terminate this litigation. But even were I to agree that the test

in Kavanaugh remains open to further refinement, that, I repeat, would hardly justify the Court's attempt to deploy the
Contract Clause as an apparently unyielding instrument for
policing the policies of New Jersey and New York. For such
an interpretation plainly is at odds with the principles articulated in Kavanaugh and Faitoute, and subsequently reconfirmed by El Paso v Simmons, 379 U S. 497 (1965)
The
Court there considered a provision of Texas law that abolished
an unlimited redemption period for landowners whose land had
been defaulted to the State for nonpayment of interest, substituting a 5-year reinstatement period in its place. Unlike
appellant here, Simmons at least could claim to have suffered
tangible economic injury by virtue of the State's modification
of his land-sale contract, indeed, as a result of that "impairment" he permanently lost property to the State. And, of
course, Texas' "self-interest [was] at stake," ante, at 26, since
it alone was the beneficiary of Simmons' curtailed right of reinstatement. Yet, properly applying the teachings of Blazsdell,
Kavanaugh, and Faitoute, the Court had little difficulty in
sustaining the measure as a means of removing clouds on
title arising from pending reinstatement rights, 379 U S., at
508-509 (citations omitted)
"The Blatsdell opinion, which amounted to a comprehensive restatement of the principles underlying the application of the Contract Clause, makes it quite clear that
'[n] ot only is the constitutional provision qualified by the
measure of control which the State retains over remedial
processes, but the State also continues to possess authority to safeguard the vital interests of its people. It does
not matter that legislation appropriate to that end "has
the result of modifying or abrogating contracts already in
effect."
' 'Once we are in this domain of the reserve
power of a State we must respect the "wide discretion on
the part of the legislature in determining what is and
what is not necessary" ' "

It need hardly be said that today's decision is markedly out
of step with this deferential philosophy The Court's willingness to uphold an impairment of contract-no matter how
"technical" the injury-only on a showing of "necessity"
ante, at 29-31, is particularly distressing, for this Court
always will be able to devise abstract alternatives to the concrete action actually taken by a State. For example, in
virtually every decided Contract Clause case, the government
could have exercised the Court's "lesser alternative" of resorting to its powers of taxation as a substitute for modifying
overly restrictive contracts. Ante, at 30 n. 29. Nothing, at
least on the level of abstraction and conjecture engaged in by
the Court today, prevented the appropriation of monies by
Illinois to buy back or modify the corporate charter of the
polluting fertilizer company in Fertilizing Co. v Hyde Park,
97 U S. 659 (1878), or by New Jersey to ensure the financial
solvency of Asbury Park bonds, Faitoute Iron & Steel Co v
City of Asbury Park, supra, or by Texas to purchase the unlimited redemption rights involved in El Paso v Simmons,
supra. Yet, in all these cases, modifications of state contracts
were countenanced, and this Court did not feel compelled or
qualified to instruct the state legislatures how best to pursue
their business. In brief, these cases recognized that when economic matters are concerned, "the availability of alternatives
does not render the [decisionmaker's] choice invalid." Knebel
v Hem, 429 U S. 288, 294 (1977)
State legislation "may not
be held unconstitutional simply because a court finds it unnecessary, in whole or in part." Whalen v Roe, 429 U S.
589, 597 (1977)
By the same token, if unforeseeability is the key to a
"reasonable" decision, as the Court now contends, ante, at 32,
almost all prior cases again must be repudiated. Surely the
legislators of Illinois could not convincingly have claimed surprise because a fertilizer company polluted the air and
transported fertilizer to its factory, Fertilizing Co. v Hyde

Park, supra. Nor was it unforeseeable to Mississippi that a
corporation which was expressly chartered to operate a lottery,
And,
in fact, did so, Stone v M11ississippi, 101 U S. 814 (1880)
of course, it was "not unknown," ante, at 32, to either debtor
or creditor that a municipality's financial condition might
falter as in FaitouteIron & Steel Co. v City of Asbury Park,
supra, indeed, the foreseeability of that very risk inheres in
the process of selecting an appropriate coupon rate. Yet, in
all of these instances this Court did not construe the Contract
Clause to prevent the States from confronting their real problems if and when their legislators came to believe that such
action was warranted. It is not our province to contest the
"reasonable 3udgments" of the duly authorized decisionmakers.
Knebel v Hem, supra,at 297
Thus, as I had occasion to remark only last Term, the Court
again offers a constitutional analysis that rests upon "abstraction [s] without substance," NationalLeague of Cities v Usery,
Given that
426 U S. 833, 860 (1976) (dissenting opinion)
this is the first case in some 40 years in which this Court has
seen fit to invalidate purely economic and social legislation on
the strength of the Contract Clause, one may only hope that it
will prove a rare phenomenon, turning on the Court's particularized appraisal of the facts before it. But there also is reason for broader concern. It is worth remembering that there is
nothing sacrosanct about a contract. All property rights, no
less than a contract, are rooted in certain "expectations" about
the sanctity of one's right of ownership. Compare ante, at
19-21, n. 17, with J Bentham, Theory of Legislation c. 8 (1911
ed.) And other constitutional doctrines are akin to the
Contract Clause in directing their protections to the property
interests of private parties. Hence the command of the Fifth
Amendment that "private property [shall noV] be taken for
public use, without just compensation" also "remans a part of
our written Constitution." Ante, at 16. And during the heyday of economic due process associated with Lochner v New

I would not want to be read as suggesting that the States
should blithely proceed down the path of repudiating their
obligations, financial or otherwise. Their credibility in the
credit market obviously is highly dependent on exercising
their vast lawmaking powers with self-restraint and discipline,
and I, for one, have little doubt that few, if any, jurisdictions
would choose to use their authority "so foolish[ly] as to kill
a goose that lays golden eggs for them," Erie R. Co. v Public
Util. Comm'rs, 254 U S., at 410. But in the final analysis,
there is no reason to doubt that appellant's financial welfare is

For this

Court should have learned long ago that the Constitution-be
it through the Contract or Due Process Clause-can actively
intrude into such economic and policy matters only if my
Brethren are prepared to bear enormous institutional and
social costs. Because I consider the potential dangers of such
judicial interference to be intolerable, I dissent.

Is And, of course, there is every reason to expect that appellant, with
combined trust and fiduciary holdings of Authority bonds amounting to
some $300 million, is not powerless in protecting its interests either before
the state legislature or in the econoic marketplace. Indeed, a myriad
of sophisticated investors, investment banks, and market analysts regularly
oversee the operation of the bond market and the affairs of municipalities
which appear m search of credit. Accordingly, any city or State that
enters the marketplace is well aware that, should it treat its creditors
abusively, the market is apt to exact "justice" that is quicker and surer
than anything that this Court can hope to offer. In brief, appellant is the
paradigm of a. litigant who is neither "discrete" nor "insular" m appealing
for this Court's time or protection.
