JOHN DOE AGENCY ET AL. v. JOHN DOE CORP.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-552.

Decided January 30, 1989

An application to stay the enforcement of the Court of Appeals' judgment
granting the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request of John Doe
Corporation (Corporation) pending the disposition of a petition for a writ
of certiorari is granted. The court below held that documents prepared
during a Government audit in connection with the Corporation's performance of Government contracts and subsequently transferred to a law
enforcement agency during a grand jury investigation of the Corporation
were not exempt from disclosure under the FOIA's exemption for records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes. The balance of equities clearly weighs in favor of a stay, since the Court of Appeals left undisturbed the District Court's finding that disclosure posed a
substantial risk of jeopardizing the grand jury investigation; since disclosure would moot part of the Court of Appeals' decision; and since the
Corporation's interest in receiving the information immediately, while
significant if its interpretation of the FOIA is correct, poses no threat of
irreparable harm. There is a reasonable probability that four Justices
will vote to grant certiorari, since there are divergent interpretations of
the meaning of the FOIA exemption at issue. And, given the plausibility of the arguments advanced in those cases adopting a broader view of
the exemption, there is a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will
vote to reverse.

Circuit Justice.
The Solicitor General requests that I issue a stay pending
the disposition of the federal parties' petition for certiorari to
review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit granted the request of John Doe Corporation (Corporation), a government
contractor, for certain documents under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U. S. C. ยง552 (1982 ed. and Supp. IV)
(FOIA). The documents had been prepared during a 1978
audit by John Doe Agency (Agency) of certain costs incurred
by the Corporation in connection with its performance of government contracts. Eight years later, the Corporation filed

a request with the Agency under the FOIA for documents relating to this audit. The request came in the context of a
grand jury investigation into possibly fraudulent activity by
the Corporation in connection with its government contracts,
an investigation in which these documents were believed to
be relevant. 850 F. 2d 105, 106 (1988).
The Agency denied the request on November 18, 1986. It
stated, apparently upon the advice of a federal prosecutor,
that the documents were exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7 of the FOIA, which exempts from mandatory disclosure "records or information compiled for law enforcement
purposes" to the extent disclosure gives rise to one or more
specified harms. 5 U. S. C. ยง 552(b)(7) (1982 ed., Supp. IV).
It proceeded to transfer the requested records to John Doe
Government Agency (Government Agency), a federal law enforcement agency. The Corporation then filed a similar
FOIA request with the Government Agency. 850 F. 2d, at
106-107.
After an administrative appeal failed, the Corporation
sought de novo review in the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of New York. The court ordered the
Agency and the Government Agency to prepare a "Vaughn
index" (after Vaughn v. Rosen, 157 U. S. App. D. C. 340,
484 F. 2d 820 (1973), cert. denied, 415 U. S. 977 (1974)) describing the documents, and to submit the index for an in
camera inspection. After reviewing the index, the court
ruled, without elaboration, that there was a "substantial
risk" that disclosure of the documents or the Vaughn index
would jeopardize the grand jury proceedings investigating
the Corporation. The court therefore ruled that the Agency
and the Government Agency were not required to turn over
the documents to the Corporation. 850 F. 2d, at 107.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. It
held that, because the documents in question were prepared
in routine audits and only later transferred to a law enforcement agency, they were not "compiled for law enforcement

purposes" within the meaning of ยง 552(b)(7). Id., at 106.
The court's mandate issued on November 28, 1988. On remand, the District Court ordered that the Vaughn index be
disclosed, and the Court of Appeals refused to stay that
order. The Solicitor General, on behalf of the Agency and
the Government Agency, has filed a petition for a writ of certiorari (No. 88-1083) seeking review of the Court of Appeals'
determination that the documents in question were not "compiled for law enforcement purposes." The Solicitor General
seeks a recall and stay, pending the disposition of the petition
for a writ of certiorari, of the mandate of the Court of Appeals, and a stay of the District Court's order on remand requiring disclosure of the Vaughn index.
My obligation as a Circuit Justice in considering a stay
application under 28 U. S. C. ยง 2101(f) and this Court's Rule
44 is "to determine whether four Justices would vote to grant
certiorari, to balance the so-called 'stay equities,' and to give
some consideration as to predicting the final outcome of the
case in this Court." Gregory-PortlandIndependent School
Dist. v. United States, 448 U. S. 1342 (1980) (REHNQUIST, J.,
in chambers); see also Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306,
1308 (1980) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers); Beame v. Friends
of the Earth, 434 U. S. 1310, 1312-1313 (1977) (MARSHALL,
J., in chambers). Evaluating these factors, I am convinced
that the request for a stay should be granted.
First, the balance of the equities clearly weighs in favor of
a stay. The District Court, having undertaken an in camera
review of the Vaughn index and other documents, specifically
found that disclosure of the Vaughn index and the documents
posed a substantial risk of jeopardizing an important ongoing
grand jury investigation. The Court of Appeals did not disturb this finding, basing its judgment for the Corporation
instead on its determination that Exemption 7 mandated
release of the documents. The Solicitor General further supports this interest by proffering an affidavit from an Assistant United States Attorney; the affidavit states that disclo-

sure can reasonably be expected to interfere with an ongoing
law enforcement investigation by apprising the targets of
that investigation of the nature of the grand jury's inquiry
and by facilitating hindrance of the investigation. The fact
that disclosure would moot that part of the Court of Appeals'
decision requiring disclosure of the Vaughn index would also
create an irreparable injury. See New York v. Kleppe, 429
U. S. 1307, 1310 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers) ("Perhaps the most compelling justification for a Circuit Justice
to upset an interim decision by a court of appeals [is] to protect this Court's power to entertain a petition for certiorari
before or after the final judgment of the Court of Appeals").
Conversely, the Corporation's interest in receiving this information immediately, while significant if the Corporation's
interpretation of the FOIA is correct, poses no threat of irreparable harm.
I also believe that there is a "reasonable probability" that
four Justices will consider the Exemption 7 issue posed by
this case sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari, and that
there is a "fair prospect" that a majority of the Court will
conclude that the decision below was erroneous. Rostker,
supra, at 1308 (BRENNAN, J., in chambers). The Courts of
Appeals have widely differed in interpreting the meaning of
the FOIA exemption for documents "compiled for law enforcement purposes." Compare New England Medical Center Hospital v. NLRB, 548 F. 2d 377, 386 (CAl 1976); Gould,
Inc. v. GSA, 688 F. Supp. 689, 699 (DC 1988); Fedders Corp.
v. FTC, 494 F. Supp. 325, 328 (SDNY) (holding it is the context in which the documents in question are currently being
used rather than the purpose for which they are created that
is relevant in determining whether a record was "compiled
for law enforcement purposes"), aff'd, 646 F. 2d 560 (CA2
1980), with John Doe Corp. v. John Doe Agency, 850 F. 2d
105, 109 (CA2 1988) (case below); Hatcher v. USPS, 556 F.
Supp. 331 (DC 1982); Gregory v. FDIC, 470 F. Supp. 1329,
1333-1334 (DC 1979) (holding that record must originally

have been compiled for law enforcement purposes to qualify
under Exemption 7); see also Crowell & Moring v. Department of Defense, 703 F. Supp. 1004, 1009 (DC 1989) (reading
of Exemption 7 in John Doe Corp. "comports with neither the
plain language of the exemption nor the purpose underlying
its enactment").
In light of these divergent interpretations, I believe it
likely that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari. In light
of the plausibility of the arguments advanced in those cases
adopting a broader view of Exemption 7's compilation provision than that of the court below, there is also a "fair prospect" that a majority of the Court will vote to reverse. I
therefore grant the requested stay of the enforcement of the
Court of Appeals' mandate and of the District Court's disclosure order pending the disposition of the petition for a writ of
certiorari in this case.
It is so ordered.
