Syllabus

RUST ET AL. v. SULLIVAN, SECRETARY OF HEALTH
AND HUMAN SERVICES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 89-1391.

Argued October 30, 1990-Decided May 23, 1991*

Section 1008 of the Public Health Service Act specifies that none of the federal funds appropriated under the Act's Title X for family-planning services "shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family
planning." In 1988, respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services issued new regulations that, inter alia, prohibit Title X projects
from engaging in counseling concerning, referrals for, and activities
advocating abortion as a method of family planning, and require such
projects to maintain an objective integrity and independence from the
prohibited abortion activities by the use of separate facilities, personnel,
and accounting records. Before the regulations could be applied, petitioners -Title X grantees and doctors who supervise Title X funds -filed
suits, which were consolidated, challenging the regulations' facial validity and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent their implementation. In affirming the District Court's grant of summary judgment to the Secretary, the Court of Appeals held that the regulations
were a permissible construction of the statute and consistent with the
First and Fifth Amendments.
Held:
1. The regulations are a permissible construction of Title X.
Pp. 183-191.
(a) Because ยง 1008 is ambiguous in that it does not speak directly to
the issues of abortion counseling, referral, and advocacy, or to "program
integrity," the Secretary's construction must be accorded substantial
deference as the interpretation of the agency charged with administering
the statute, and may not be disturbed as an abuse of discretion if
it reflects a plausible construction of the statute's plain language and
does not otherwise conflict with Congress' expressed intent. Chevron

(b) Title X's broad language plainly allows the abortion counseling,
referral, and advocacy regulations. Since the Title neither defines
