MABRY, COMMISSIONER, ARKANSAS DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION v. JOHNSON
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 83-328.

Argued April 16, 1984-Decided June 11, 1984

After respondent was convicted in an Arkansas state court on charges of
burglary, assault, and murder, the Arkansas Supreme Court set aside
the murder conviction, and plea negotiations ensued. A deputy prosecutor proposed to respondent's attorney that in exchange for a guilty
plea to a charge of accessory after a felony murder, the prosecutor would
recommend a 21-year sentence to be served concurrently with the concurrent burglary and assault sentences. However, when defense counsel called the prosecutor three days later and communicated respondent's acceptance of the offer, the prosecutor told counsel that a mistake
had been made and withdrew the offer. He proposed instead that in exchange for a guilty plea he would recommend a 21-year sentence to be
served consecutively to the other sentences. Respondent rejected the
new offer, but after a mistrial was declared, he ultimately accepted the
prosecutor's second offer, and the trial judge imposed a 21-year sentence
to be served consecutively to the previous sentences. After exhausting
state remedies, respondent sought habeas corpus relief in Federal District Court with respect to his guilty plea. The court dismissed the petition, holding that respondent had understood the consequences of his
guilty plea, that he had received effective assistance of counsel, and that
because it was not established that he had detrimentally relied on the
prosecutor's first proposed plea agreement, respondent had no right to
enforce it. However, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that "fairness" precluded the prosecution's withdrawal of the plea proposal once
accepted by respondent.
Held: Respondent's acceptance of the prosecutor's first proposed plea bargain did not create a constitutional right to have the bargain specifically
enforced, and he may not successfully attack his subsequent guilty plea.
Plea agreements are consistent with the requirements that guilty pleas
be made voluntarily and intelligently. If a defendant was not fairly apprised of its consequences, his guilty plea can be challenged under the
Due Process Clause. And when the prosecution breaches its promise
with respect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty
on a false premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand. However,

Opinion of the Court

respondent's plea was in no sense induced by the prosecutor's withdrawn
offer, and it rested on no unfulfilled promise; he knew the prosecution
would recommend a 21-year consecutive sentence. Thus, because it did
not impair the voluntariness or intelligence of his guilty plea, respondent's inability to enforce the prosecutor's first offer is without constitutional significance. Neither is the question whether the prosecutor was
negligent or otherwise culpable in first making and then withdrawing his
offer relevant. Cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U. S. 257. Pp. 507-511.

the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether a defendant's acceptance of a prosecutor's proposed plea bargain creates a constitutional right to have the bargain specifically enforced.
In the late evening of May 22, 1970, three members of a
family returned home to find a burglary in progress. Shots
were exchanged resulting in the daughter's death and the
wounding of the father and respondent-one of the burglars.
Respondent was tried and convicted on three charges:
burglary, assault, and murder. The murder conviction
was set aside by the Arkansas Supreme Court, Johnson v.
State, 252 Ark. 1113, 482 S. W. 2d 600 (1972). Thereafter,
plea negotiations ensued.
At the time of the negotiations respondent was serving his
concurrent 21- and 12-year sentences on the burglary and
assault convictions. On Friday, October 27, 1972, a deputy

prosecutor proposed to respondent's attorney that in exchange for a plea of guilty to the charge of accessory after a
felony murder, the prosecutor would recommend a sentence

of 21 years to be served concurrently with the burglary and
assault sentences. On the following day, counsel communicated the offer to respondent who agreed to accept it. On
the next Monday the lawyer called the prosecutor "and communicated [respondent's] acceptance of the offer." App. 10.
The prosecutor then told counsel that a mistake had been
made and withdrew the offer. He proposed instead that in
exchange for a guilty plea he would recommend a sentence of
21 years to be served consecutively to respondent's other
sentences.
Respondent rejected the new offer and elected to stand
trial. On the second day of trial, the judge declared a mistrial and plea negotiations resumed, ultimately resulting in
respondent's acceptance of the prosecutor's second offer. In
accordance with the plea bargain, the state trial judge imposed a 21-year sentence to be served consecutively to the
previous sentences.
After exhausting his state remedies, respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. §2254.1
The District Court dismissed the petition, finding that respondent had understood the consequences of his guilty plea,
that he had received the effective assistance of counsel, and
that because the evidence did not establish that respondent
had detrimentally relied on the prosecutor's first proposed
plea aogTeement, respondent had no right to enforce it. The
Court of Appeals reversed, 707 F. 2d 323 (CA8 1983), over
Judge John R. Gibson's dissent. The majority concluded
that "fairness" precluded the prosecution's withdrawal of a
plea proposal once accepted by respondent. Because of a

granted certiorari, 464 U. S. 1017 (1983). We now reverse.3

Respondent can obtain federal habeas corpus relief only if
his custody is in violation of the Federal Constitution.4 A
plea bargain standing alone is without constitutional significance; in itself it is a mere executory agreement which, until
embodied in the judgment of a court, does not deprive an
accused of liberty or any other constitutionally protected
interest.' It is the ensuing guilty plea that implicates the
I Compare Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 614 F. 2d 360 (CA3 1980), and
United States v. Greenman, 700 F. 2d 1377 (CAll), cert. denied, 464 U. S.
992 (1983), with Cooper v. United States, 594 F. 2d 12 (CA4 1979).
This case is not moot despite the fact that respondent has been paroled.
Respondent remains in the "custody" of the State, see Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963); see generally Justices of Boston Municipal
Court v. Lydon, 466 U. S. 294, 300-302 (1984); Hensley v. Municipal
Court, 411 U. S. 345 (1973); and whether respondent must serve the
sentence now under attack consecutively to his prior sentences will affect
the date at which his parole will expire under state law, see Ark. Stat.
Ann. § 43-2807(c) (Supp. 1983). Respondent's challenge to the duration of
his custody therefore remains live.

E. g., Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312 (1963). In pertinent part,
the habeas statute provides:
"The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court
shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the
ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or
treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C. § 2254(a).
Under Arkansas law, there is no entitlement to have the trial court impose a recommended sentence since a negotiated sentence recommendation
does not bind the court, see Varnedare v. State, 264 Ark. 596, 599, 573
S. W. 2d 57, 60 (1978); Marshall v. State, 262 Ark. 726, 561 S. W. 2d 76
(1978); Ark. Rule Crim. Proc. 25.3(c); there is a critical difference between
an entitlement and a mere hope or expectation that the trial court will
follow the prosecutor's recommendation, see Olim v. Wakinekona, 461
U. S. 238, 248-251 (1983); Jago v. Van Curen, 454 U. S. 14, 19-21 (1981)

convicted, and it is that conviction which gave rise to the
deprivation of respondent's liberty at issue here.'
It is well settled that a voluntary and intelligent plea of
guilty made by an accused person, who has been advised by
competent counsel, may not be collaterally attacked. 7 It is
also well settled that plea agreements are consistent with the
requirements of voluntariness and intelligence-because each
side may obtain advantages when a guilty plea is exchanged
for sentencing concessions, the agreement is no less voluntary than any other bargained-for exchange.8 It is only

(1971). For example, in Brady v. United States we wrote:
"For a defendant who sees slight possibility of acquittal, the advantages of
pleading guilty and limiting the probable penalty are obvious-his exposure is reduced, the correctional processes can begin immediately, and the
practical burdens of a trial are eliminated. For the State there are also
advantages-the more promptly imposed punishment after an admission of
guilt may more effectively attain the objectives of punishment; and with
the avoidance of trial, scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources are conserved for those cases in which there is a substantial issue of the defendant's guilt or in which there is substantial doubt that the State can sustain
its burden of proof. It is this mutuality of advantage that perhaps
explains the fact that at present well over three-fourths of the criminal
convictions in this country rest on pleas of guilty, a great many of them
no doubt motivated at least in part by the hope or assurance of a lesser
penalty than might be imposed if there were a guilty verdict after a trial
to judge or jury." 397 U. S., at 752 (footnotes omitted).

Opinion of the Court

when the consensual character of the plea is called into question that the validity of a guilty plea may be impaired. In
Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742 (1970), we stated the
applicable standard:
"'[A] plea of guilty entered by one fully aware of the
direct consequences, including the actual value of any
commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or
his own counsel, must stand unless induced by threats
(or promises to discontinue improper harassment),
misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unfulfillable
promises), or perhaps by promises that are by their
nature improper as having no proper relationship to
the prosecutor's business (e. g. bribes)."' Id., at 755
(quoting Shelton v. United States, 246 F. 2d 571, 572,
n. 2 (CA5 1957) (en banc) (in turn quoting 242 F. 2d 101,
115 (Tuttle, J., dissenting to panel opinion)), rev'd on
other grounds, 356 U. S. 26 (1958).
Thus, only when it develops that the defendant was not
fairly apprised of its consequences can his plea be challenged
under the Due Process Clause. Santobello v. New York,
404 U. S. 257 (1971), illustrates the point. We began by
acknowledging that the conditions for a valid plea "presuppose fairness in securing agreement between an accused and
a prosecutor. . . . The plea must, of course, be voluntary and
knowing and if it was induced by promises, the essence of
those proriiises must in some way be made known." Id., at
261-262. It follows that when the prosecution breaches its
promise with respect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty on a false premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand: "[W]hen a plea rests in any significant
degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that
it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,
such promise must be fulfilled." Id., at 262.1

Opinion of the Court

467 U. S.

Santobello demonstrates why respondent may not successfully attack his plea of guilty. Respondent's plea was in no
sense induced by the prosecutor's withdrawn offer; unlike
Santobello, who pleaded guilty thinking he had bargained for
a specific prosecutorial sentencing recommendation which
was not ultimately made, at the time respondent pleaded
guilty he knew the prosecution would recommend a 21-year
consecutive sentence. Respondent does not challenge the
District Court's finding that he pleaded guilty with the advice
of competent counsel and with full awareness of the consequences-he knew that the prosecutor would recommend and
that the judge could impose the sentence now under attack."
Respondent's plea was thus in no sense the product of governmental deception; it rested on no "unfulfilled promise" and
fully satisfied the test for voluntariness and intelligence.
Thus, because it did not impair the voluntariness or intelligence of his guilty plea, respondent's inability to enforce
the prosecutor's offer is without constitutional significance."
1 Respondent suggests that the prosecutor's withdrawal of the initial
offer undermined his confidence in defense counsel, in violation of his Sixth
Amendment right to counsel. This argument is simply at odds with reason. Prosecutors often come to view an offense more seriously during the
course of pretrial investigation for reasons entirely unrelated to what defense counsel has done or is likely to do. See United States v. Goodwin,
457 U. S. 368, 381 (1982). We fail to see how an accused could reasonably
attribute the prosecutor's change of heart to his counsel any more than he
could have blamed counsel had the trial judge chosen to reject the agreedupon recommendation, or, for that matter, had he gone to trial and been
convicted. The District Court and the Court of Appeals concluded that
counsel effectively advised respondent; that is all the Constitution requires. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 656-657, n. 19 (1984);
Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S., at 266-268; Parkerv. North Carolina,397
U. S., at 797-798; McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S., at 770-771.
" Indeed, even if respondent's plea were invalid, Santobello expressly
declined to hold that the Constitution compels specific performance of a
broken prosecutorial promise as the remedy for such a plea; the Court
made it clear that permitting Santobello to replead was within the range of
constitutionally appropriate remedies. See 404 U. S., at 262-263; see also

MABRY v. JOHNSON
504

Opinion of the Court

Neither is the question whether the prosecutor was negligent
or otherwise culpable in first making and then withdrawing
his offer relevant. The Due Process Clause is not a code
of ethics for prosecutors; its concern is with the manner in
which persons are deprived of their liberty. 1" Here respondent was not deprived of his liberty in any fundamentally unfair way. Respondent was fully aware of the likely consequences when he pleaded guilty; it is not unfair to expect him
to live with those consequences now.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.

id., at 268-269 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
It follows that respondent's constitutional rights could not have been violated. Because he pleaded after the prosecution had breached its "promise" to him, he was in no worse position than Santobello would have been
had he been permitted to replead.
, 2Santobello itself rejected the relevance of prosecutorial culpability: "It
is now conceded that the promise to abstain from a recommendation was
made, and at this stage the prosecution is not in a good position to argue
that its inadvertent breach of agreement is immaterial. The staff lawyers
in a prosecutor's office have the burden of 'letting the left hand know what
the right hand is doing' or has done. That the breach of agreement was
inadvertent does not lessen its impact." Id., at 262. Cf. United States v.
Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 110 (1976).
