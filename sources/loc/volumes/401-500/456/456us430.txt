PER CURIAM.

Under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257, this Court has jurisdiction to
review only "[f]inal judgments or decrees rendered by the
highest court of a State in which a decision could be had."
Because the Colorado Supreme Court remanded this case for
trial, its decision is not final "as an effective determination of
the litigation." Market Street R. Co. v. Railroad Comm'n of
Cal., 324 U. S. 548, 551 (1945). Although there is a limited
set of situations in which we have found finality as to the federal issue despite the ordering of further proceedings in the
lower state courts, see Cox BroadcastingCorp. v. Cohn, 420
U. S. 469 (1975), this case does not fit into any of those categories. We therefore dismiss for want of jurisdiction.
It is so ordered.

*Charles S. Sims, Leon Friedman, Christopher A. Hansen, and
Anthony F. Renzo filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union et
a]. as amici curiae urging affirmance.
