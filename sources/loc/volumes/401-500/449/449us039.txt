STONE ET AL. v. GRAHAM, SUPERINTENDENT OF
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION OF KENTUCKY
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT
OF KENTUCKY

No. 80-321.

Decided November 17, 1980

Held. A Kentucky statute requiring the posting of a copy of the Ten
Commandments, purchased with private contributions, otl the wall of
each public school classroom in the State has no secular legislative
purpose, and therefore is unconstitutional as violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. While the state legislature required the notation in small print at the bottom of each display that
"[t]he secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen
in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization
and the Common Law of the United States," such an "avowed" secular
purpose is not sufficient to avoid conflict with the First Amendment.
The pre-eminent purpose of posting the Ten Commandments, which
do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, is plainly religious in nature, and the posting serves no constitutional educational
function. Cf. Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203.
That the posted copies are financed by voluntary private contributions
is immaterial, for the mere posting under the auspices of the legislature
provides the official support of the state government that the Establishment Clause prohibits. Nor is it significant that the Ten Command,
ments are merely posted rather than read aloud, for it is no defense
to urge that the religious practices may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment
Certiorari granted; 599 S. W. 2d 157, reversed.

PER CURIAM.

A Kentucky statute requires the posting of a copy of the
Ten Commandments, purchased with private contributions,
on the wall of each public classroom in the State.' PetiI The statute provides in its entirety:
"(1) It shall be the duty of the superintendent of public instruction,
provided sufficient funds are available as provided in subsection (3) of
this Section, to ensure that a durable, permanent copy of the Ten Corn-

tioners, claiming that this statute violates the Establishment
and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment,' sought
an injunction against its enforcement. The state trial court
upheld the statute, finding that its "avowed purpose" was
"secular and not religious," and that the statute would
'neither advance nor inhibit any religion or religious group"
nor involve the State excessively in religious matters. App.
to Pet. for Cert. 38-39. The Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Kentucky affirmed by an equally divided court.

We reverse.

This Court has announced a three-part test for determining

whether a challenged state statute is permissible under the
Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution:

"First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one
that neither advances nor inhibits religion . . . ; finally
the statute must not foster 'an excessive government en-

tanglement with religion.'" Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403
U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971) (citations omitted).
If a statute violates any of these three principles, it must be
mandments shall be displayed on a wall in each public elementary and
secondary school classroom in the Commonwealth. The copy shall be
sixteen (16) inches wide by twenty (20) inches high.
"(2) In small print below the last commandment shall appear a notation concerning the purpose of the display, as follows: 'The secular
application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption
as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common
Law of the United States.'
"(3) The copies required by this Act shall be purchased with funds
made available through voluntary contributions made to the state treasurer for the purposes of this Act." 1978 Ky. Acts, ch. 436, § 1 (effective
June 17, 1978), Ky. Rev. Stat. § 158.178 (1980).
2 The First Amendment
provides in relevant part: "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof . . . ." This prohibition is applicable to the States
through the Fourteenth Amendment.

Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 215-216 (1963).

struck down under the Establishment Clause. We conclude
that Kentucky's statute requiring the posting of the Ten
Commandments in public school rooms has no secular legislative purpose, and is therefore unconstitutional.
The Commonwealth insists that the statute in question
serves a secular legislative purpose, observing that the legislature required the following notation in small print at the
bottom of each display of the Ten Commandments: "The
secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen
in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western
Civilization and the Common Law of the United States."
1978 Ky. Acts, ch. 436, § 1 (effective June 17, 1978), Ky. Rev.
Stat. § 158.178 (1980).
The trial court found the "avowed" purpose of the statute
to be secular, even as it labeled the statutory declaration
"self-serving."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 37. Under this
Court's rulings, however, such an "avowed" secular purpose is
not sufficient to avoid conflict with the First Amendment.
In Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203
(1963), this Court held unconstitutional the daily reading of
Bible verses and the Lord's Prayer in the public schools, despite the school district's assertion of such secular purposes
as "the promotion of moral values, the contradiction to the
materialistic trends of our times, the perpetuation of our institutions and the teaching of literature." Id., at 223.
The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature. The
Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, 3 and no legislative recitation of a
supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact. The
Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder,
3As this Court commented in Abington School District v. Schempp,
supra, at 224: "Surely the place of the Bible as an instrument of religion
cannot be gainsaid . ... "

adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. See Exodus 20: 12-17; Deuteronomy 5: 16-21. Rather, the first part
of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry,
not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day. See Exodus 20: 1-11; Deuteronomy 5: 6-15.
This is not a case in which the Ten Commandments are
integrated into the school curriculum, where the Bible may
constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history,
civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like. Abington School District v. Schempp, supra, at 225. Posting of
religious texts on the wall serves no such educational function. If the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are to
have any effect at all, it will be to induce the schoolchildren
to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey, the
Commandments. However desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion, it is not a permissible state objective
under the Establishment Clause.
It does not matter that the posted copies of the Ten Commandments are financed by voluntary private contributions,
for the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the
legislature provides the "official support of the State...
Government" that the Establishment Clause prohibits. 374
U. S., at 222; see Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 431 (1962).4
Nor is it significant that the Bible verses involved in this case
are merely posted on the wall, rather than read aloud as in
Schempp and Engel, for "it is no defense to urge that the
religious practices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment." Abington School District
v. Schempp, supra, at 225. We conclude that Ky. Rev.
4 Moreover, while the actual copies of the Ten Commandments were
purchased through private contributions, the State nevertheless expended
public money in administering the statute. For example, the statute
requires that the state treasurer serve as a collecting agent for the contributions. Ky. Rev. Stat. § 158.178 (3) (1980).

Stat. § 158.178 (1980) violates the first part of the Lemon v.

Constitution.'
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the
judgment below is reversed.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE BLACKMUN dissent. They
would grant certiorari and give this case plenary consideration.

JUSTICE STEWART

dissents from this summary reversal of the

courts of Kentucky, which, so far as appears, applied wholly
correct constitutional criteria in reaching their decisions.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

dissenting.

With no support beyond its own ipse dixit, the Court
concludes that the Kentucky statute involved in this case
"has no secular legislative purpose," ante, at 41 (emphasis
supplied), and that "[t]he pre-eminent purpose for posting
the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature," ibid. This even though, as the trial court
found, "[t]he General Assembly thought the statute had a
secular legislative purpose and specifically said so." App. to
Pet. for Cert. 37. The Court's summary rejection of a secular purpose articulated by the legislature and confirmed by
the state court is without precedent in Establishment Clause
jurisprudence. This Court regularly looks to legislative articulations of a statute's purpose in Establishment Clause cases
5The Supreme Court cases cited by the dissenting opinion as contrary,
Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756 (1973); Sloan
v. Lemon, 413 U. S. 825 (1973); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602
(1971); Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968), are easily
distinguishable: all are cases involving state assistance to private schools.
Such assistance has the obvious legitimate secular purpose of promoting
educational opportunity. The posting of the Ten Commandments on
classroom walls has no such secular purpose.

and accords such pronouncements the deference they are due.
See, e. g., Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, 413
U. S. 756, 773 (1973) ("we need touch only briefly on the
requirement of a 'secular legislative purpose.' As the recitation of legislative purposes appended to New York's law indicates, each measure is adequately supported by legitimate,
nonsectarian state interests"); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S.
602, 613 (1971) ("the statutes themselves clearly state they
are intended to enhance the quality of the secular education"); Sloan v. Lemon, 413 U. S. 825, 829-830 (1973);
Board of Education v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 243 (1968). See
also Florey v. Sioux Falls School District, 619 F. 2d 1311,
1314 (CA8) (upholding rules permitting public school Christmas observances with religious elements as promoting the
articulated secular purpose of "advanc[ing] the student's
knowledge and appreciation of the role that our religious
heritage has played in the social, cultural and historical development of civilization"), cert. denied, post, p. 987. The
fact that the asserted secular purpose may overlap with what
some may see as a religious objective does not render it unconstitutional. As this Court stated in McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 445 (1961), in upholding the validity of
Sunday closing laws, "the present purpose and effect of most
of [these laws] is to provide a uniform day of rest for all
citizens; the fact that this day is Sunday, a day of particular
significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the
state from achieving its secular goals."
Abington School District v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963),
repeatedly cited by the Court, is not to the contrary. No
statutory findings of secular purpose supported the challenged
enactments in that case. In one of the two cases considered
in Abington School District the trial court had determined
that the challenged exercises were intended by the State to be
religious exercises. Id., at 223. A contrary finding is presented here. In the other case no specific finding had been

STONE v. GRAHAM

J., dissenting

made, and "the religious character of the exercise was admitted by the State," id., at 224.1

The Court rejects the secular purpose articulated by the
State because the Decalogue is "undeniably a sacred text,"
ante, at 41. It is equally undeniable, however, as the elected
representatives of Kentucky determined, that the Ten Commandments have had a significant impact on the development
of secular legal codes of the Western World. The trial court
concluded that evidence submitted substantiated this determination. App. to Pet. for Cert. 38. See also Anderson v.
Salt Lake City Corp., 475 F. 2d 29, 33 (CA10 1973) (upholding construction on public land of monument inscribed with
Ten Commandments because they have "substantial secular
attributes"). Certainly the State was permitted to conclude
that a document with such secular significance should be
placed before its students, with an appropriate statement of
the document's secular import. See id., at 34 ("It does not
seem reasonable to require removal of a passive monument,
involving no compulsion, because its accepted precepts, as
a foundation for law, reflect the religious nature of an ancient
era"). 2 See also Opinion of the Justices, 108 N. H. 97, 228

A. 2d 161 (1967) (upholding placement of plaques with the
motto "In God We Trust" in public schools).
The Establishment Clause does not require that the public
sector be insulated from all things which may have a religious
1The Court noted that even if the State's purpose were not strictly religious, "it is sought to be accomplished through readings, without comment,
from the Bible." 374 U. S., at 224. Here of course there was no compelled reading, and there was comment accompanying the text of the
Commandments, mandated by statute and focusing on their secular
significance.
2 The Court's emphasis on the religious nature of the first part of the
Ten Commandments is beside the point. The document as a whole has
had significant secular impact, and the Constitution does not require that
Kentucky students see only an expurgated or redacted version containing
only the elements with directly traceable secular effects.

significance or origin. This Court has recognized that "religion has been closely identified with our history and government," Abington School District, supra, at 212, and that
"[tihe history of man is inseparable from the history of religion," Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 434 (1962). Kentucky
has decided to make students aware of this fact by demonstrating the secular impact of the Ten Commandments. The
words of Justice Jackson, concurring in McCollum v. Board
of Education, 333 U. S. 203, 235-236 (1948), merit quotation
at length:
"I think it remains to be demonstrated whether it is
possible, even if desirable, to comply with such demands
as plaintiff's completely to isolate and cast out of secular
education all that some people may reasonably regard as
religious instruction. Perhaps subjects such as mathematics, physics or chemistry are, or can be, completely
secularized. But it would not seem practical to teach
either practice or appreciation of the arts if we are to
forbid exposure of youth to any religious influences.
Music without sacred music, architecture minus the
cathedral, or painting without the scriptural themes
would be eccentric and incomplete, even from a secular
point of view....

I should suppose it is a proper, if not

an indispensable, part of preparation for a worldly life
to know the roles that religion and religions have played
in the tragic story of mankind. The fact is that, for
good or for ill, nearly everything in our culture worth
transmitting, everything which gives meaning to life, is
saturated with religious influences, derived from paganism, Judaism, Christianity-both Catholic and Protestant-and other faiths accepted by a large part of the
world's peoples. One can hardly respect the system of
education that would leave the student wholly ignorant
of the currents of religious thought that move the world
society for a part in which he is being prepared."

I therefore dissent from what I cannot refrain from describing as a cavalier summary reversal, without benefit of oral
argument or briefs on the merits, of the highest court of
Kentucky.
