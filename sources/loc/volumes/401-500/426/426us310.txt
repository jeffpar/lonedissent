426 U. S.

OMAHA NATIONAL BANK v. NEBRASKANS FOR
INDEPENDENT BANKING, INC., ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT

No. 75-1382.

Decided June 7, 1976

Court of Appeals' judgment that petitioner national bank's drivein/walk-in facility was a branch petitioner was not permitted
to operate because a state bank would not be permitted to operate
a like facility is vacated, and the case is remanded for reconsideration in light of an intervening amendment to the statute redefining
the "auxiliary teller" facilities that state banks may operate.
Certiorari granted; 530 F. 2d 755, vacated and remanded.

PER CURIAM.

From the time petitioner Omaha National Bank sought
approval from the Regional Administrator of National
Banks of its drive-in/walk-in facility until after the en
banc decision of the Court of Appeals, Nebraska law permitted a state-chartered bank to operate one "attached
auxiliary teller office" and not more than two "detached
auxiliary teller offices." Neb. Rev. Stat. § 8-157 (2)
(1974). The two types of "auxiliary teller offices" were
defined in Nebraska Department of Banking Reg. § 8157-01 (1970). The Court of Appeals found it "abundantly clear" that a state bank situated like Omaha
National would not be permitted to operate the added
facility, and ruled that under 12 U. S. C. § 36, see
First Nat. Bank v. Dickinson, 396 U. S. 122, 135 (1969),
the facility was a branch which the bank was not permitted to operate. 530 F. 2d 755, 762 (CA8 1976).
Since the en banc decision, § 8-157 (2) has been
amended by Legislative Bill 763, approved by the Governor on March 11, 1976, to redefine "auxiliary teller"
facilities which state banks may operate. It appearing

that this amendment, which will become effective in
July 1976, may have a substantial bearing on the outcome of this case, the petition for certiorari is granted,
the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of Legislative Bill 763.
So ordered.
