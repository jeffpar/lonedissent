OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE IN
CHAMBERS

CALIFORNIA v. VELASQUEZ
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-773. Decided March 24, 1980
California's application for a stay, pending review by certiorari, of enforcement of the California Supreme Court's judgment reversing the
imposition of a death sentence but upholding respondents conviction, is

granted.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

Circuit Justice.

Applicant seeks a stay of the enforcement of the judgment
of the Supreme Court of California in People v. Velasquez, 26
Cal. 3d 425, 606 P. 2d 341 (1980), pending the filing of a
petition for certiorari and its disposition by this Court. Applicant contends that the Supreme Court of California has
reversed the imposition of a sentence of death, although upholding the conviction, because the trial was conducted in
violation of this Court's decision in Witherspoon v. Illinois,
391 U. S. 510 (1968).
This Court has granted certiorari in Adams v. Texas, No.
79-5175, 444 U. S. 990, and that case is presently set for argument today. The issues presented there are sufficiently
related to the issues which the applicant State says it will
raise in its petition for certiorari in this case that I have
decided to grant the State's application for stay pending
(1) consideration and decision of Adams v. Texas, supra, by
this Court, and (2) the filing and disposition of a timely petition for certiorari in this case by the applicant.
I am not persuaded by the response that the decision below
rests upon a reading of state law by the Supreme Court of

OCTOBER TERM, 1979
Opinion in Chambers

445 U. S.

California. Neither In re Anderson, 69 Cal. 2d 613, 447 P. 2d
117 (1968), which was cited by the court below, nor People
v. Wheeler, 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978), which was
not, supports respondent's position. Anderson, as I read it,
was based primarily upon this Court's decision in Witherspoon. Wheeler, while itself based on state law, seems clearly
distinguishable from the present case.
The application for stay is accordingly granted.
