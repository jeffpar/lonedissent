OCTOBER TERM, 1983

Opinion in Chambers

464 U. S.

CLARK, SECRETARY OF INTERIOR, ET AL. V.
CALIFORNIA ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-470. Decided December 20, 1983*
Applications to stay the District Court's preliminary injunction prohibiting
the Secretary of the Interior from conducting a sale of certain tracts on
the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing are granted
pending this Court's resolution in another case of a controlling question
involving the proper construction of §307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.

Circuit Justice.
Applicants, who include the Secretary of the Interior and
the Western Oil and Gas Association, request that I stay a
preliminary injunction issued by the United States District
Court for the Central District of California. The United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the request for a stay without opinion. The preliminary injunction
prohibits the Secretary from conducting Lease Sale 73, the
sale of 137 designated tracts on the Pacific Outer Continental
Shelf for oil and gas leasing. As issued it is effective pending
final determination of respondent California's claims, the
principal of which is its claim that the Secretary did not prepare an adequate "consistency determination" pursuant to
§307(c)(1) of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, 86
Stat. 1285, 16 U. S. C. § 1456(c)(1), as interpreted by the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Californiav. Watt,
683 F. 2d 1253 (1982), cert. granted, 461 U. S. 925 (1983)
(argued November 1, 1983).
Section 307(c)(1) provides:
"Each Federal agency conducting or supporting activities directly affecting the coastal zone shall conduct or
JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

*Together with No. A-471, Western Oil & Gas Association et al. v.
California et al., also on application for stay of the same preliminary
injunction.

support those activities in a manner which is, to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with approved state
management programs." 16 U. S. C. §1456(c)(1) (emphasis added).
In Californiav. Watt, supra (now sub nom. Clark v. California), the Court will decide whether the Secretary's sale of oil
and gas leases is an activity "directly affecting" the coastal
zone within the meaning of § 307(c)(1). Unless the Court answers that question in the affirmative, there is no statutory
requirement at this stage of the project that the Secretary
prepare the "consistency determination" which the District
Court deemed inadequate and which formed the basis of its
decision to issue the injunction in this case.
Having examined the submissions of the parties, I have decided to stay the preliminary injunction pending this Court's
resolution of the question presented in Clark v. California,
concluding as I do that in the interim the traditional considerations affecting the award of equitable relief favor the
applicants.
It is so ordered.
