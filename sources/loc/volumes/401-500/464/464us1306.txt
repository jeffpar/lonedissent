OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion in Chambers

464 U. S.

McDONALD v. MISSOURI
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-525.

Decided January 3, 1984*

Applications to stay the executions of the four applicants, each convicted in
a Missouri state court of capital murder, are granted, where the Missouri
Supreme Court, after affirming each conviction and sentence on direct

appeal, set the execution in each case on a date within the period for
petitioning this Court for a writ of certiorari for direct review of the conviction and sentence.

Circuit Justice.
I have before me applications to stay the executions
of Samuel Lee McDonald, Leonard Marvin Laws, Thomas
Henry Battle, and George Clifton Gilmore, each convicted in
a Missouri state court of capital murder and each sentenced
to die on January 6, 1984. Their respective convictions and
sentences have been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Missouri on direct appeal, State v. McDonald, 661 S. W. 2d
497 (1983); State v. Laws 661 S. W. 2d 526 (1983); State
v. Battle, 661 S. W. 2d 487 (1983); State v. Gilmore, 650
S. W. 2d 627 (1983), but review here on such federal grounds
as the respective applicants may possess has not yet been
had. The execution date in each case has been fixed by
the Missouri Supreme Court. See Mo. Rule Crim. Proc.
29.08(d).
In Williams v. Missouri, 463 U. S.1301 (1983), I granted a
stay of execution pending timely filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari on direct review. That case procedurally
was similar to these, and the Supreme Court of Missouri
there, also, had denied a stay of its mandate. In a short accompanying opinion, I pointed out that, if a federal question
is involved, the process of direct review "'includes the right

Opinion in Chambers

to petition this Court for a writ of certiorari,"' ibid., quoting
Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983).
stated:

I specifically

"[I]f a State schedules an execution to take place before
filing and disposition of a petition for certiorari, I must
stay that execution pending completion of direct review,
as a matter of course." 463 U. S., at 1302.
Every defendant in a state court of this Nation who has a
right of direct review from a sentence of death, no matter
how heinous his offense may appear to be, is entitled to have
that review before paying the ultimate penalty. The right of
review otherwise is rendered utterly meaningless. It makes
no sense to have the execution set on a date within the time
specified for that review, see 28 U. S. C. §§ 1257 and 2101;
this Court's Rule 20.1, and before the review is completed.
I thought I had advised the Supreme Court of Missouri once
before, in Williams, that, as Circuit Justice of the Circuit in
which the State of Missouri is located, I, upon proper application, shall stay the execution of any Missouri applicant whose
direct review of his conviction and death sentence is being
sought and has not been completed. I repeat the admonition
to the Supreme Court of Missouri, and to any official within
the State's chain of responsibility, that I shall continue that
practice. The stay, of course, ought to be granted by the
state tribunal in the first instance, but, if it fails to fulfill its
responsibility, I shall fulfill mine.
Accordingly, in each of the four cases, I grant the application to stay the execution now scheduled for January 6, 1984.
Orders are being entered accordingly.
