This case requires us to determine whether a person
released on his own recognizance is "in custody" within
the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28
U. S. C. §§ 2241 (c)(3), 2254 (a). See Peyton v. Rowe,
391 U. S. 54 (1968); Carafasv. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234
(1968); Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963).

Amendment grounds. The court denied relief, holding
that since the petitioner was enlarged on his own recognizance pending execution of sentence, he was not yet
"in custody" for purposes of the habeas corpus statute.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed that
release on one's own recognizance is not sufficient custody
to confer jurisdiction on the District Court, and affirmed
the judgment. 453 F. 2d 1252 (1972). 1 We granted
certiorari, A09 U. S. 840 (1972), ,hd we reverse.
Convicted of a misdemeanor in California Municipal
Court for violation*of § 29007 of the California Education Code,2 petitioner was sentenced to serve one year in
jail and pay a line of $625
He appealed his conviction
unsuccessfully to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court, and his efforts to have the conviction set
aside on state court collateral attack have proved equally
unavailing. It appears that petitioner exhausted all
available state court remedies prior to filing this petition for federal habeas corpus. See 28 U. S. C.
§ 2254 (b).3
"The Court of Appeals concluded that the question was controlled by a prior decision of the same court, Matysek v. United
States, 339 F. 2d 389 (1964).
2Petitioner was convicted of awarding Doctor of Divinity degrees
without obtaining the necessary accreditation. He defended the
charge on the grounds that he is the chief presiding officer of a bona
fide church, that his church has awarded honorary Doctor of Divinity
certificates to persons who have completed a course of instruction in
the church's principles, and that state interference with this practice
is an unconstitutional restraint on the free exercise of his religious

beliefs.
3There is a substantial question whether petitioner has forfeited
the right to raise his First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge to
the state court conviction by deliberately.bypassing an opportunity
to raise the claim in the state courts. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391
(1963). Respondent maintains that petitioner deliberately absented
himself from trial following the close of the prosecution's case, with

HENSLEY v. MUNICIPAL COURT

Opinion of the Court

At all times since his conviction petitioner has been
enlarged on his own recognizance. While pursuing his
state court remedies he remained at large under an order
of the state trial court stayirig execution of his sentence.
And the state trial court extended its stay, even after the
Supreme Court of California declined to hear his application for postconviction relief, apparently to permit
petitioner to remain at large while seeking habeas -corpus
in the United States District Court. Pending appeal
from the District Court's denial of relief, an application
for extension of the state court stay was granted by Mr.
Justice Black, as Acting Circuit Justice, on August 12,
1970, and extended by MR. JusTIcE DOUGLAS, as Circuit
Justice, on August 20,, 1970, and again on September 9,
1970.1 The Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of
habeas corpus, but granted a 30-day stay of its mandate pending application for certiorari. That stay was
extended by MR. JusTICE DOUGLAS, as Circuit Justice,
on March 20, 1972, and it is pursuant to his order that
petitioner remains at large at the present time.
full knowledge that the trial would continue in his absence. He
thereby relinquished, respondent contends, the right to defend himself and present evidence on his behalf. Petitioner argues in response that trial counsel failed to advise him of the reopening of
trial and failed to warn him that absence from trial would lead to
conviction. Accordingly, he asserts that he should not be held to
have knowingly and intelligently bypassed an available state procedure. The record on this point is more than a little obscure, and
we express no opinion on the question beyond noting that the issue
was not considered, much less resolved, by either of the courts below,
and it is not in any sense presented for our decision.
4In his Motion for Stay, filed in this Court on August 11, 1970,
and addressed to the Circuit Justice of the Ninth Circuit, petitioner
explained-that the "Stay of Execution granted by the Trial Court
is scheduled to expire on August 12, 1970, at which time petitioner
has been ordered to surrender himself .to the Sheriff of Santa Clara
County for immediate incarceration." '-\otion for Stay 2.

Opinion of the Court

411 U. S.

The C4lifornia Penal Code- provides that any court
that may release a defendant upon his giving bail may
release him on his own recognizance, provided he agrees
in writing that:
"(a) He will appear at all times and places as ordered by the court or magistrate releasing him and
as ordered by any court in which, or any magistrate
before whom, the charge is subsequently pending.
"(b) If he fails to so appear and is 'apprehended
outside of the State of California, he waives
extradition.
"(c) Any court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction may revoke the order of release and either
return him to custody or require that he give bail
or other assurance of his appearance

"

Cal.

Penal Code § 1318.4.
A defendant is subject to re-arrest if he fails to appear
as agreed, id., § 1318.8 (a), and a willful failure to appear
is itself a criminal offense. Id., § 1319.6. We assume
that these statutory conditions have been imposed on
petitioner at all times since the state trial court stayed
execution of his sentence.
The question presented for our decision is a narrow one:
namely, whether the conditions imposed on petitioner
as the price of his release constitute "custody" as that
term is used in the habeas corpus statute. Respondent
contends that the conditions imposed on petitioner are
significantly less restrictive than those imposed on the
petitioner in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963),
where we held that a person released on parole is "in
custody" for purposes of the district courts' habeas corpus
jurisdiction. It is true, of course, that the parolee is
generally subject to greater restrictions on his liberty of
movement than a person released on bail or his own
recognizance. And some lower courts have reasoned

HENSLEY v. MUNICIPAL COURT
345

Opinion of the Court

that this difference precludes an extension of the writ
in cases such as the one before us.5 , On the other hand,
a substantial number of courts, perhaps'a majority, have
concluded that a person released on bail or on his own
recognizance may be "in custody" within the meaning of
the statute.' In view of the analysis, which led to a'
finding of custody in Jones v. Cunningham, supra, we
conclude that this latter line of cases reflects the sounder
view.
While the "rhetoric celebrating habeas corpus has
changed little over the centuries," 7it is nevertheless true
that the furnctions of the writ have undegoue dramatic
change. Our recent decisions have reasoned fromi th
premise that habeas corpus is not "a static; narrow,
formalistic remedy," Jones v. Cunninghani;supra, at 243,

the laws of that State imposes "sufficient constructive custody" to
permit an application for writ of habeas corpus. In re Smiley, 66

but one which must retain the "ability to cut through
barriers of form and procedural mazes." Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 291 (1969). See Frank v. Mangum,
.237-U. S. 309, 346 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting). "The
very nature of the writ demands that it be administered
with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that
miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and
corrected." Harris v. Nelson, supra, at 291.
Thus, we have consistently rejected interpretations of
the habeas corpus statute that would suffocate the writ
in stifling formalisms or hobble its effectiveness with the
manacles of arcane and scholastic procedural requirements. The demand for speed, flexibility, and simplicity
is clearly evident in our decisions concerning the exhaustion doctrineFay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Brown
v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953); the criteria for relitigation
of factual questions, Townsend v. Saino 372 U. S. 293
(1963); the prematurity doctrine, Peyton v. Rowe, 391
U. S. 54 (1968) the choice of forum, Braden v. 30th
-Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484 (1973);
Strait v. Laird,406 U. S. 341 (1972); and the procedural
requirements of a habeas corpus hearing, Harrisv. Nelson,
supra. That same theme has indelibly marked our construction of the statute's custody requirement. See
Strait v. Laird, supra; Peyton v. Rowe, supra; Carafas

Insofar as former decisions, Stallings v. Splain, 253 U. S. 339

U. S. 284 (1898); Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564 (1885), may
indicate a narrower reading of the custody requirement, they may no
longer be deemed controlling. IR none of the decisions on which we
today rely, Strait v. Laird, supra; Peyton -v.Rowe, supra; Carafas
v. LaVallee, supra; Jones v. Cunningham, supra, are these earlier

cases even cited in the opinions of the Court.

HENSLEY v. MUNICIPAL COURT
345

Opinion of the Court

The custody requirement of the habeas corpus statute
is designed to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a
remedy for severe restraints on individual liberty. Since
habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy whose operation is to a large extent uninhibited by traditional rules
of finality and federalism, its use has been limited to
cases of special urgency, leaving more conventional
remedies for cases in which the restraints on liberty are
neither severe nor immediate. Applying that principle,
we can only conclude that petitioner is in custody for
purposes of the habeas corpus statute. First, he is subject to restraints "not shared by the public generally,"
Jones v. Cunningham, supra, at 240: that is, the obligation to appear "at all times and places as ordered"
by "[a] ny court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction."
Cal. Penal Code §§ 1318.4 (a), 1318.4 (c). He cannot
come and go as he pleases. His freedom of movement
rests in the hands of state judicial officers, who may demand his presence at any time and without a moment's
notice. *Disobedience is itself a criminal offense. The
restraint on his liberty is surely no less severe than the
conditions imposed on the unattached reserve officer
whom we held to be "in custody" in Strait v. Laird,
9
supra.
Second, petitioner remains at large only by the grace
of a stay entered first by the state trial court and then
extended by two Justices of this Court. The State has
emphatically indicated its determination to put him behind bars, and the State has taken every possible step
to secure that result. His incarceration is not, in other
0 Similarly, in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410
U. S. 484 (1973), where the Commonwealth of Kentucky had lodged
a detainer against a prisoner in an Alabama jail, we held that the
petitioner was in the custody of Kentucky officials for purposes of his

habeas corpus action.

words, a speculative possibility that depends on a number of contingencies over which he has no control. This
is not a case where the unfolding of events may render
the. entire controversy academic. The petitioner has
been forced to fend off the state authorities by means of
a stay, and those authorities retain the determination
and the power to seize him as soon as the obstacle of the
stay is removed. The need to keep the stay in force is
itself an unusual and substantial impairment of .his
liberty.
Moreover, our conclusion that the petitioner is presently in custody does not interfere with any significant
interest of the State. Indeed, even if we were to accept
respondent's argument that petitioner is not in custody,
that result would do no more than postpone this habeas
corpus action until petitioner had begun service of his
sentence." It would still remain open to the District
Court to order petitioner's release pending consideration
of his habeas corpus claim. In re Shuttlesworth, 369
U. S. 35 (1962). Even if petitioner remained in jail
'only long'enough to have his petition filed in the District
Court, his release by order of the District Court would
not jeopardize his "custody" for purposes of a habeas

corpus action. Carafas v. LaVallee, supra."
10

By contrast, a finding of no "custody" in Carafas v. LaVallee,

supra,"would not, merely have postponed the exercise of habeas
corpus jurisdiction, but would have. barred it altogether. Similarly,
if we had held in Jones "v,Cunningham, supra, that a parolee is not
in custody, then habeas corpus jurisdiction could not have been exercised until such'time as release on parole was revoked. Cf. Peyton
v. Rowe, supra.
"See United States ex rel. Pon v. .sperdy, 296 F. Supp. 726
(SDNY 1969); Goldberg "v.Hendrick, 254 F. Supp. 286, 288-289
(ED Pa. 1966).

HENSLEY v. MUNICIPAL COURT
345

BLACKmUN, J., concurring in result

we would badly serve the purposes and the history of the
writ to hold that under these circumstances the petitioner's failure to spend even 10. minutes in jail is enough
to deprive the District Court of power to hear his 'constitutional claim.
Finally, we emphasize that our decision does not open
the doors of the district courts to the habeas corpus
petitions of all persons released on bail or on their own
recognizance. We are concerned here with a petitioner
who has been convicted in state court and who has apparently exhausted all available state court opportunities
to have that conviction set aside. Where a state defendant is released on bail or on his own recognizance
pending trial or pending appeal, he must still contend
with the requirements of the exhaustion doctrine if he
seeks habeas corpus relief in the federal courts. Nothing in today's opinion alters the application of that doctrine to such a defendant.
Since the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that
petitioner was not "in custody" at the time his petition
was filed, its judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court to consider his petition for
a writ of habeas corpus.
Reversed and remanded.

I emphasize again, as I did in my separate concurrence
in Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S.
484, 501 (1973), that the Court has wandered a long way
down the road in expanding traditional notions of habeas
corpus. Indeed, the Court now concedes this. Ante,
at 349. The present case is yet another step. Although
recognizing that the custody requirement is designed to
preserve the writ as a remedy for severe restraints on

individual liberty, ante, at 351, the Court seems now to
equate custody with almost any restraint, however
tenuous. One wonders where the 'end is. Nevertheless,
in the light of cases already decided by the Court, I feel
compelled to go along and therefore concur in the result.
MR. JUSTICE

REHNQUIST,

with whom THE

CHIaEF

JUsTIcE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.
The issue in this case is whether petitioner was in "custody," within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 2241, entitling
'him to the benefit'of the extraordinary writ of habeas
corpus. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
unanimously held that he was neither in actual nor constructive custody. If there is any Vestige left of the
obvious and the original meaning of "custody" the court
below was right and the majority opinion of this Court
today has further stretched both the letter and the rationale of the statute.'
Petitioner has been free on his own recognizance since
his conviction and the imposition of sentence in the summer of 1969. The California statute authorizing his
release imposes no territorial or supervisory limitations
and he has been subject to none. He has not been
required to post any security for his appearance. At
the time of the filing of his federal habeas petition,
the only conceivable restraint on him was that at the
time of the expiration of the stay granted by the state
court, petitioner would have had to surrender himself
to the custody of the sheriff. ' The record shows that for
the three and ene-half years since his conviction, petitioner has utilized his freedom to travel both within and
without the State of California for business purposes.
Petitioner was under no greater restriction than one
who had been subpoenaed to testify in court as a Witness.

J., dissenting

This is simply not "custody" in any known sense of the
word, and it surely is not what was meant by Congress
when it enacted 28 U. S. C. § 2241. The Court apparently
feels, like Faust, that it has in its previous decisions already made its bargain with the devil, and it does not shy
from this final step in the rewriting of the statute. I
cannot agree, and I therefore dissent.
