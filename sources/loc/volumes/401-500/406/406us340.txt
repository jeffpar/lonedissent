We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the

for the Southern District of New York, 315 F. Supp.
357 (1970). 404 U. S. 909 (1971). We agree that in
this noncollision admiralty case the District Court properly dismissed petitioner's third-party complaint for
contribution against respondent Erie on the authority
of Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Corp., 342 U. S.
282 (1952). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
