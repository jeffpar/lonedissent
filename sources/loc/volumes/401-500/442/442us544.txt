UNITED STATES ET AL. v. RUTHERFORD ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 78-605.

Argued April 25, 1979-Decided June 18, 1979

Terminally ill cancer patients and their spouses brought this action to
enjoin the Government from interfering with the interstate shipment and
sale of Laetrile, a drug not approved for distribution under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act). Section 505 of the Act prohibits
interstate distribution of any "new drug" unless the Secretary of Health,
Education, and Welfare approves an application supported by substantial evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness. Section 201
(p) (1) of the Act defines a "new drug" to include "any drug . .. not
generally recognized . . . as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling." Finding
that Laetrile, in proper dosages, was nontoxic and effective, the District
Court ordered the Government to permit limited purchases of the drug
by one of the named plaintiffs. While not disturbing the injunction,
the Court of Appeals instructed the District Court to remand the case
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for determination whether
Laetrile was a "new drug" under § 201 (p) (1), and, if so, whether it was
exempt from premarketing approval under either of the Act's two
grandfather clauses. After completion of administrative hearings, the
Commissioner of the FDA found that Laetrile constituted a "new drug"
as defined in § 201 (p) (1) and fell within neither grandfather provision.
On review of the Commissioner's decision, the District Court concluded
that Laetrile was entitled to an exemption from premarketing approval
under the Act's 1962 grandfather clause and, alternatively, that the
Commissioner had infringed constitutionally protected privacy interests
by denying cancer patients access to Laetrile. The Court of Appeals,
without addressing either the statutory or constitutional rulings of the
District Court, held that the Act's "safety" and "effectiveness" standards
have "no reasonable application" to terminally ill cancer patients and
approved intravenous injections of Laetrile for such individuals.
Held: The Act makes no express exception for drugs used by the terminally
ill and no implied exemption is necessary to attain congressional objectives or to avert an unreasonable reading of the terms "safe" and
"effective" in § 201 (p) (1). Pp. 551-559.

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
544

Syllabus

(a) Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress intended
protection only for persons suffering from curable diseases. Moreover,
in implementing the statutory scheme, the FDA has never exempted
drugs used by the terminally ill. The construction of a statute by
those charged with its administration is entitled to substantial deference
particularly where, as here, an agency's interpretation involves issues of
considerable public controversy, and Congress has not acted to correct
any misperception of its statutory objectives. Pp. 552-554.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the safety and
effectiveness standards of § 201 (p) (1) could have "no reasonable application" to terminal patients. For purposes of § 201 (p) (1), the effectiveness of a drug does not necessarily denote capacity to cure; in the
treatment of any illness, terminal or otherwise, a drug is effective if it
fulfills, by objective indices, its sponsor's claims of prolonged life, improved physical condition, or reduced pain. Nor is the concept of safety
under § 201 (p) (1) without meaning for terminal patients; a drug is
unsafe for the terminally ill, as for anyone else, if its potential for
inflicting death or physical injury is not offset by the possibility of
therapeutic benefit. Finally, construing § 201 (p) (r) to encompass
treatments for terminal diseases does not foreclose all resort to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy is
unavailing. That § 505 (i) of the Act makes explicit provision for carefully regulated use of certain drugs not yet demonstrated to be safe and
effective reinforces the conclusion that no exception for terminal patients
may be judicially implied. Pp. 554-559.

MR. JusnicE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.

The question presented in this case is whether the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act precludes terminally ill cancer
patients from obtaining Laetrile, a drug not recognized as

"safe and effective" within the meaning of § 201 (p) (1) of
the Act, 52 Stat. 1041, as amended, 21 U. S. C. § 321 (p)(1).

I
Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
52 Stat. 1052, as amended, 21 U. S. C. § 355, prohibits interstate distribution of any "new drug" unless the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare approves an application supported by substantial evidence of the drug's safety and effectiveness.' As defined in § 201 (p) (1) of the Act, 21 U. S. C.

OCTOBER TERM, 1978
Opinion of the Court

442 U. S.

Exemptions from premarketing approval procedures are available for drugs intended solely for investigative use 2 and
drugs qualifying under either of the Act's two grandfather
provisions.3
In 1975, terminally ill cancer patients and their spouses
brought this action to enjoin the Government from interfering with the interstate shipment and sale of Laetrile, a drug
not approved for distribution under the Act.4

Finding that

Laetrile, in proper dosages, was nontoxic and effective, the
District Court ordered the Government to permit limited purchases of the drug by one of the named plaintiffs. 399 F.
The requirements for investigative use are set forth in § 505 (i) of the
Act, 21 U. S. C. § 355 (i). See n. 1, supra.
3 In the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1041,
Congress exempted from the definition of "new drug" any drug that was
subject to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, if
its labeling retained the same representations concerning conditions of use
made prior to 1938. This exemption is currently contained in § 201 (p) (1)
of the Act, as codified in 21 U. S. C. § 321 (p) (1). The Drug Amendments of 1962 added a second grandfather clause, which provides:
2

"In the case of any drug which, on the day immediately preceding the
enactment date [October 10, 1962], (A) was commercially used or sold in
the United States, (B) was not a new drug as defined by section 201 (p)
of the basic Act as then in force, and (C) was not covered by an effective
[new drug] application under section 505 of that Act, the amendments to
section 201 (p) made by this Act shall not apply to such drug when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day." § 107 (c) (4),
76 Stat. 789.
4 The suit was originally instituted by a cancer patient, Juanita Stowe,
and her husband, Jimmie Stowe. After Ms. Stowe's death, two other
patients, Glen L. Rutherford and Phyllis S. Schneider, and Ms. Schneider's
husband, filed an amended complaint on behalf of a class composed of all
cancer patients and spouses responsible for the costs of treatment. By
order entered April 8, 1977, the District Court certified a class consisting
of terminally ill cancer patients. 429 F. Supp. 506 (WD Okla.). The
Government did not seek review of that order.

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
544

Opinion of the Court

Supp. 1208, 1215 (WD Okla. 1975).5

On appeal by the Gov-

ernment, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit did not
disturb the injunction. However, it instructed the District
Court to remand the case to the Food and Drug Administration for determination whether Laetrile was a "new drug"
under § 201 (p) (1), and, if so, whether it was exempt from
premarketing approval under either of the Act's grandfather
clauses. 542 F. 2d 1137 (1976).

After completion of administrative hearings,6 the Commissioner issued his opinion on July 29, 1977. 42 Fed. Reg.
39768 (1977). He determined first that no uniform definition
of Laetrile exists; rather, the term has been used generically
for chemical compounds similar to, or consisting at least in
part of, amygdalin, a glucoside present in the kernels or seeds
of most fruits. Id., at 39770-39772. The Commissioner further found that Laetrile in its various forms constituted a
"new drug" as defined in § 201 (p) (1) of the Act because it
was not generally recognized among experts as safe and effective for its prescribed use. See 42 Fed. Reg. 39775-39787
(1977). In so ruling, the Commissioner applied the statutory
criteria delineated in Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &
Dunning, Inc., 412 U. S. 609, 629-630 (1973), and concluded
that there were no adequate well-controlled scientific studies
of Laetrile's safety or effectiveness. 42 Fed. Reg. 3977539787 (1977).
The District Court subsequently entered similar orders for other in-

dividuals who submitted affidavits averring their membership in the certified class of terminally ill cancer patients. See App. 1-6.
6The Commissioner initiated proceedings with an announcement in the
Federal Register seeking public comment. 42 Fed. Reg. 10066-10069
(1977). Notice was also afforded to certain known proponents of Laetrile.
See id., at 39785-39786.
7The Act does not define what constitutes general recognition of a
drug's safety and effectiveness under § 201 (p) (1). However, based on
the structure and purpose of the statutory scheme, this Court in Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U. S., at 629-634,

OCTOBER TERM, 1978
Opinion of the Court

442 U. S.

Having determined that Laetrile was a new drug, the Commissioner proceeded to consider whether it was exempt from
premarketing approval under the 1938 or 1962 grandfather
provisions. On the facts presented, the Commissioner found
that Laetrile qualified under neither clause. See id., at
39787-39795. First, there was no showing that the drug currently known as Laetrile was identical in composition or labeling to any drug distributed before 1938. See 21 U. S. C.
§ 321 (p) (1) ; n. 3, supra. Nor could the Commissioner conclude from the evidence submitted that, as of October 9, 1962,
Laetrile in its present chemical composition was commercially
used or sold in the United States, was generally recognized by
experts as safe, and was labeled for the same recommended
uses as the currently marketed drug. See § 107 (c)(4), 76
Stat. 789; n. 3, supra.
On review of the Commissioner's decision, the District
Court sustained his determination that Laetrile, because not
generally regarded as safe or effective, constituted a new drug
under § 201 (p) (1). 438 F. Supp. 1287, 1293-1294 (WD
Okla. 1977). The court also approved the Commissioner's
denial of an exemption under the 1938 grandfather clause.
However, concluding that the record did not support the Commissioner's findings as to the 1962 grandfather provision, the
District Court ruled that Laetrile was entitled to an exemption from premarketing approval requirements. Id., at 12941298. Alternatively, the court held that, by denying cancer
patients the right to use a nontoxic substance in connection
with their personal health, the Commissioner had infringed
constitutionally protected privacy interests. Id., at 12981300.
The Court of Appeals addressed neither the statutory nor
the constitutional rulings of the District Court. Rather, the
interpreted § 201 (p) (1) to require an "expert consensus" on safety and
effectiveness founded upon "substantial evidence" as defined in § 505 (d)
of the Act, 21 U. S. C. § 355 (d). See n. 1, supra.

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
544

Opinion of the Court

Tenth Circuit held that "the 'safety' and 'effectiveness' terms
used in the statute have no reasonable application to terminally ill cancer patients." 582 F. 2d 1234, 1236 (1978).
Since those patients, by definition, would "die of cancer regardless of what may be done," the court concluded that there
were no realistic standards against which to measure the safety
and effectiveness of a drug for that class of individuals. Id.,
at 1237. The Court of Appeals therefore approved the District Court's injunction permitting use of Laetrile by cancer
patients certified as terminally ill. However, presumably because the Commissioner had found some evidence that Laetrile
was toxic when orally administered, see 42 Fed. Reg. 3978639787 (1977), the Court of Appeals limited relief to intravenous injections for patients under a doctor's supervision. 582
F. 2d, at 1237. In addition, the court directed the FDA to
promulgate regulations "as if" the drug had been found "'safe'
and 'effective'" for terminally ill cancer patients. Ibid.
We granted certiorari, 439 U. S. 1127 (1979), and now
reverse.
II
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act makes no special
provision for drugs used to treat terminally ill patients. By
its terms, § 505 of the Act requires premarketing approval for
"any new drug" unless it is intended solely for investigative
use or is exempt under one of the Act's grandfather provisions.
See nn. 2, 3, supra. And § 201 (p) (1) defines "new drug" to
encompass "[a] ny drug ...not generally recognized... as safe
and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling." See supra, at
546-547.
When construing a statute so explicit in scope, a court must
act within certain well-defined constraints. If a legislative
purpose is expressed in "plain and unambiguous language, ...
the . . . duty of the courts is to give it effect according to its
terms." United States v. Lexington Mill & Elevator Co., 232
U. S.399, 409 (1914). See Andrus v. Sierra Club, ante, p. 347.

OCTOBER TERM, 1978

Opinion of the Court

442 U. S.

Exceptions to clearly delineated statutes will be implied only
where essential to prevent "absurd results" or consequences
obviously at variance with the policy of the enactment as a
whole. Helvering v. Hammell, 311 U. S. 504, 510-511 (1941).
See TVA v. Hill, 437 U. S. 153, 187-188 (1978) ; United States
v. Key, 397 U. S.322, 324-325 (1970); United States v. American Trucking Assns., 310 U. S. 534, 543-544 (1940). In
the instant case, we are persuaded by the legislative history
and consistent administrative interpretation of the Act that no
implicit exemption for drugs used by the terminally ill is necessary to attain congressional objectives or to avert an unreasonable reading of the terms "safe" and "effective" in § 201
(p) (1).
A
Nothing in the history of the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which first established procedures for review of
drug safety, or of the 1962 Amendments, which added the current safety and effectiveness standards in § 201 (p) (1),8 suggests that Congress intended protection only for persons
suffering from curable diseases. To the contrary, in deliberations preceding the 1938 Act, Congress expressed concern that
individuals with fatal illnesses, such as cancer, should be
shielded from fraudulent cures. See, e. g., 79 Cong. Rec. 5023
(1935) (remarks of Sen. Copeland, sponsor of the Act); 83
Cong. Rec. 7786-7787, 7789 (1938) (remarks of Reps. Phillips
and Lea). Similarly, proponents of the 1962 Amendments to
the Act, including Senator Kefauver, one of the bill's sponsors,
8Under the 1938 Act, a "new drug" was one not generally recognized
by qualified experts as safe for its recommended use. § 201 (p) (1), 52
Stat. 1041. The Drug Amendments of 1962, Pub. L. 87-781, 76 Stat. 789,
redefined the term to include drugs not generally recognized as effective
or safe for their intended use. § 201 (p)(1), 21 U. S. C. § 321 (p)(1).
See supra, at 546-547, 551. In addition, the Amendments provided that
no new drug application may be approved absent substantial evidence that
the drug is effective as well as safe under prescribed conditions. § 505 (d),
21 U. S. C. § 355 (d). See n. 1, supra.

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
544

Opinion of the Court

indicated an understanding that experimental drugs used to
treat cancer "in its last stages" were within the ambit of the
statute. See, e. g., 108 Cong. Rec. 17399 (1962) (remarks of
Sen. Kefauver); id., at 17401 (comments of Sen. Eastland).
That same understanding is reflected in the Committee Reports on the 1962 Amendments. Both Reports note with approval the FDA's policy of considering effectiveness when
passing on the safety of drugs prescribed for "life-threatening
disease." I
In implementing the statutory scheme, the FDA has never
made exception for drugs used by the terminally ill. As this
Court has often recognized, the construction of a statute by
those charged with its administration is entitled to substantial deference. Board of Governors of FRS v. First Lincoln9 The Senate Report states:
"The Food and Drug Administration now requires, in determining whether
a 'new drug' is safe, a showing as to the drug's effectiveness where the
drug is offered for use in the treatment of a life-threatening disease, or
where it appears that the 'new drug' will occasionally produce serious toxic
or even lethal effects so that only its usefulness would justify the risks
involved in its use. In such cases, the determination of safety is, in the
light of the purposes of the new drug provisions, considered by the Food
and Drug Administration to be inseparable from consideration of the drug's
effectiveness. The provisions of the bill are in no way intended to affect
any existing authority of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to consider and evaluate the effectiveness of a new drug in the context
of passing upon its safety." S. Rep. No. 1744, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1,
p. 15 (1962).
See also H. R. Rep. No. 2464, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1962).
The FDA's practice was further amplified by HEW Secretary Ribicoff
in testimony on the bill that ultimately became the 1962 Amendments:
"If the drug is offered for treatment of progressive or life-threatening
diseases, such as cancer, . .. we now consider its effectiveness. In such
cases the determination of safety is, in the light of the purpose of the new
drug provisions, inseparable from consideration of the drug's effectiveness." Hearings on S. 1552 before the Subcommittee on Antitrust and
Monopoly of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Seass.,

Inc. v. NLRB, 429 U. S. 298, 304 (1977); Udall v. Tallman,
380 U. S. 1, 16 (1965). Such deference is particularly appropriate where, as here, an agency's interpretation involves
issues of considerable public controversy, and Congress has not
acted to correct any misperception of its statutory objectives.
See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 381
(1969); Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U. S. 1, 11-12 (1965). ° Unless
and until Congress does so, we are reluctant to disturb a longstanding administrative policy that comports with the plain
language, history, and prophylactic purpose of the Act.
B
In the Court of Appeals' view, an implied exemption from
the Act was justified because the safety and effectiveness
'o To be sure, it may not always be realistic to infer approval of a
judicial or administrative interpretation from congressional silence alone.
See, e. g., Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119-121 (1940); Toucey v.
New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U. S. 118, 140-141 (1941). But once
an agency's statutory construction has been "fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress," and the latter has not sought to alter
that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects,
then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned. Apex
Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 487-489 (1940). See United States
v. Bergh, 352 U. S. 40, 46-47 (1956). See, e. g., Pub. L. 94-295, 90 Stat.
575; Pub. L. 94-278, 90 Stat. 411; and Pub. L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1281
(amending § 201 of the Act., 21 U. S. C. § 321).
The issue presented in this case plainly has not escaped public or legislative notice. Whether Laetrile should be freely accessible to cancer
patients has been a frequent subject of political debate. Seventeen States
have legalized the prescription and use of Laetrile for cancer treatment
within their borders, and similar statutes have been defeated in 14 other
States. See CCH F. D. Cosm. L. Rep. 42,292 (1978); Comment., Laetrile: Statutory and Constitutional Limitations on the Regulation of Ineffective Drugs, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 233, 234 n. 8 (1978). That Congress
is aware of the FDA's policy concerning Laetrile is evident from Senate
Subcommittee hearings on the Commissioner's 1977 ruling. See Hearing
before the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate
Committee on Human Resources, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977).

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
544

Opinion of the Court

standards set forth in § 201 (p) (1) could have "no reasonable
application" to terminally ill patients. 582 F. 2d, at 1236.
We disagree. Under our constitutional framework, federal
courts do not sit as councils of revision, empowered to rewrite
legislation in accord with their own conceptions of prudent
public policy. See Anderson v. Wilson, 289 U. S. 20, 27
(1933). Only when a literal construction of a statute yields
results so manifestly unreasonable that they could not fairly
be attributed to congressional design will an exception to statutory language be judicially implied. See TVA v. Hill, 437
U. S., at 187-188. Here, however, we have no license to
depart from the plain language of the Act, for Congress could
reasonably have intended to shield terminal patients from
ineffectual or unsafe drugs.
A drug is effective within the meaning of § 201 (p) (1) if
there is general recognition among experts, founded on substantial evidence, that the drug in fact produces the results
claimed for it under prescribed conditions. See Weinberger
v. Hynson, Westcott & Dunning, Inc., 412 U. S., at 629-634;
n. 7, supra. Contrary to the Court of Appeals' apparent assumption, see 582 F. 2d, at 1236, effectiveness does not necessarily denote capacity to cure. In the treatment of any illness, terminal or otherwise, a drug is effective if it fulfills, by
objective indices, its sponsor's claims of prolonged life, improved physical condition, or reduced pain. See 42 Fed. Reg.
39776-39786 (1977).
So too, the concept of safety under § 201 (p) (1) is not
without meaning for terminal patients. Few if any drugs are
completely safe in the sense that they may be taken by all
persons in all circumstances without risk." Thus, the Commissioner generally considers a drug safe when the expected
therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use.' 2 For

OCTOBER TERM, 1978
Opinion of the Court

442 U. S.

the terminally ill, as for anyone else, a drug is unsafe if its
potential for inflicting death or physical injury is not offset by
the possibility of therapeutic benefit. Indeed, the Court of
Appeals implicitly acknowledged that safety considerations
have relevance for terminal cancer patients by restricting
authorized use of Laetrile to intravenous injections for persons
under a doctor's supervision. See 582 F. 2d, at 1237; supra,
at 551.
Moreover, there is a special sense in which the relationship
between drug effectiveness and safety has meaning in the context of incurable illnesses. An otherwise harmless drug can
be dangerous to any patient if it does not produce its purported therapeutic effect. See 107 Cong. Rec. 5640 (1961)
(comments of Sen. Kefauver). But if an individual suffering
from a potentially fatal disease rejects conventional therapy in
favor of a drug with no demonstrable curative properties, the
consequences can be irreversible. 3 For this reason, even
before the 1962 Amendments incorporated an efficacy standard
into new drug application procedures, the FDA considered
effectiveness when reviewing the safety of drugs used to treat
terminal illness. See nn. 8, 9, supra. The FDA's practice
also reflects the recognition, amply supported by expert medical testimony in this case, that with diseases such as cancer
it is often impossible to identify a patient as terminally ill
except in retrospect. 4 Cancers vary considerably in behavior
'a See, e. g., 42 Fed. Reg. 39768, 39787 (1977)
(statement of Dr. Carl
Leventhal, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Drugs, FDA, and Assistant
Professor of Neurology and Pathology at Georgetown University) ("The
safety of a drug for human use depends, in large measure, on the therapeutic effectiveness of the particular drug ....
In the case of cancer, treat-

ment with an ineffective drug will .

.

. inexorably lead to the patient's

death"); ibid. (statement of Dr. George J. Hill II, Chairman of the
Department of Surgery at Marshall University School of Medicine, W. Va.)
(Ineffectual treatment can lead to delay in accepted modes of therapy and
needless deaths; thus, "[ian the absence of scientific evidence of effectiveness, no drug intended for use in treating cancer can be regarded as safe").

and in responsiveness to different forms of therapy. See 42
Fed. Reg. 39777 (1977).z" Even critically ill individuals may
have unexpected remissions and may respond to conventional
treatment. Id., at 39777, 39805. Thus, as the Commissioner
concluded, to exempt from the Act drugs with no proved effectiveness in the treatment of cancer "would lead to needless
deaths and suffering among... patients characterized as 'terminal' who could actually be helped by legitimate therapy."
Id., at 39805.
It bears emphasis that although the Court of Appeals' ruling
was limited to Laetrile, its reasoning cannot be so readily confined. To accept the proposition that the safety and efficacy
standards of the Act have no relevance for terminal patients
is to deny the Commissioner's authority over all drugs, howClinical Oncology Branch of the National Cancer Institute's Baltimore
Research Center) ("[N]o one can prospectively define the term 'terminal'

with any accuracy. A patient can be said to be terminal only after he
dies. Many patients who are critically ill respond to modem day management of cancer"); ibid. (statement of Dr. Joseph Ross, Professor of
Medicine, University of California School of Medicine at Los Angeles)
("[T]he distinction of 'terminal' patients from 'non-terminal' patients
may not be reliably determined and an assumption that Laetrile may be
given to ['terminal'] patients with impunity may deprive such patients
of therapeutic measures which could help them").
15 The Commissioner noted that these unexpected behavior patterns may
account for anecdotal claims of Laetrile's effectiveness. Users of Laetrile
who experience spontaneous remissions or delayed responses to conventional therapy after its abandonment may ascribe their improvement to
Laetrile without any objective basis for that attribution. See, e. g., id.,
at 39777 (statement of Dr. Daniel S. Martin, researcher in cancer immunology and chemotherapy); id., at 39800 (statement of Dr. Emil J.
Frereich, Chief of the Division of Oncology at University of Texas Medical
School at Houston); ibid. (statement of Dr. Melvin Krant, Director of
Cancer Project at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center).
Particularly since accepted cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and
radiation often have painful side effects, the Commissioner concluded that
patients who subjectively perceive improvement after substituting Laetrile
for these modes of therapy may erroneously believe- that their condition
has been arrested or ameliorated. See id., at 39777, 39799-39800.

Opinion of the Court

442 U. S.

ever toxic or ineffectual, for such individuals. If history is
any guide, this new market would not be long overlooked.
Since the turn of the century, resourceful entrepreneurs have
advertised a wide variety of purportedly simple and painless
cures for cancer, including liniments of turpentine, mustard,
oil, eggs, and ammonia; peat moss; arrangements of colored
floodlamps; pastes made from glycerin and limburger cheese;
mineral tablets; and "Fountain of Youth" mixtures of spices,
oil, and suet. 6 In citing these examples, we do not, of course,
intend to deprecate the sincerity of Laetrile's current proponents, or to imply any opinion on whether that drug may ultimately prove safe and effective for cancer treatment. But
this historical experience does suggest why Congress could reasonably have determined to protect the terminally ill, no less
than other patients, from the vast range of self-styled panaceas that inventive minds can devise.
We note finally that construing § 201 (p) (1) to encompass
treatments for terminal diseases does not foreclose all resort
to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy is unavailing. Section 505 (i) of the Act, 21
U. S. C. § 355 (i), exempts from premarketing approval drugs
intended solely for investigative use if they satisfy certain
preclinical testing and other criteria.'
An application for
clinical testing of Laetrile by the National Cancer Institute is
now pending before the Commissioner. Brief for United States

UNITED STATES v. RUTHERFORD
Opinion of the Court

35 n. 23. That the Act makes explicit provision for carefully
regulated use of certain drugs not yet demonstrated safe and
effective reinforces our conclusion that no exception for terminal patients may be judicially implied. Whether, as a
policy matter, an exemption should be created is a question for
legislative judgment, not judicial inference.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.8

So ordered.

18 Respondents urge that we consider the District Court's rulings on the
constitutional and grandfather clause questions as alternative bases for
sustaining the judgment below. However, since the Court of Appeals addressed neither issue, we remand the case for further consideration of
respondents' claims. See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. National Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435 U. S. 519, 549 (1978); Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 271 (1977).
