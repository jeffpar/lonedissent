427 U. S.

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM COURT OF APPEALS OF KENTUCKY

No. 74-1409.

Argued December 9, 1975-Decided June 28, 1976

Under Kentucky's two-tier court system, police courts (the first
tier) have jurisdiction of misdemeanor cases, but an accused has
an appeal of right from a police judge's decision to the circuit
court (the second tier), where there is a trial de novo. The
State Constitution requires cities in Kentucky to be classified according to population size. By statute judges of police courts in
cities of less than a certain population need not be lawyers, but
in larger cities they must be, and all circuit court judges are
lawyers. In this challenge to the constitutionality of the statutory scheme held:
1. An accused, who is charged with a misdemeanor for which he
is subject to possible imprisonment, is not denied due process when
tried before a nonlawyer police court judge in one of the smaller
cities, when a later trial de novo is available in the circuit court.
Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57; Tumey v. Ohio, 273
U. S. 510, distinguished. Pp. 333-339.
2. Nor does the State deny such an accused equal protection
of the laws by providing law-trained judges for some police courts
and lay judges for others, depending upon the State Constitution's
classification of cities according to population, since as long as all
people within each classified area are treated equally, the different
classifications within the court system are justified. Missouri v.
Lewis, 101 U. S. 22. Pp. 338-339.

MR. CIIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of
the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether an accused, subject to possible imprisonment, is denied due
process when tried before a nonlawyer police court
judge with a later trial de novo available under a State's
two-tier court system; and whether a State denies equal
protection by providing law-trained judges for some
police courts and lay judges for others, depending upon
the State Constitution's classification of cities according
to population.

Opinion of the Court

427 U. S.

Appellant's trial was scheduled for July 18, 1974, at
7 p. m., before the Lynch City Police Court. Appellee
C. B. Russell, who is not a lawyer, was the presiding
judge. Appellant's request for a jury was denied although under Kentucky law he was entitled to a jury
trial. Ky. Const. § 11; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 25.014,
26.400 (1971). Appellant pleaded not guilty. Appellant was found guilty and sentenced to 30 days in jail,
a fine of $150, and revocation of his driver's license.
Section 156 of the Kentucky Constitution requires
cities to be classified according to population size.
There are six classes of cities: fifth-class cities have
a population of between 1,000 and 3,000; sixth-class
cities have a population of less than 1,000. Lynch
is a fifth-class city. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 81.010 (5)
(1971). A police judge in fifth- and sixth-class cities
must by statute be a voter and resident of the city for
at least one year and be bonded, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann.
§ 26.200 (1971); the police judge in such cities need not
be a lawyer. Police judges in first-class cities, which
have populations of over 100,000, must have the same
qualifications as a circuit judge, who must be at least
35 years of age, a citizen of Kentucky, a two-year resident of the district, and a practicing attorney for eight
years.' Ky. Const. § 130; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26.140
(1971). Police court judges have terms of four years.
days and not more than six months; any subsequent offense requires
imprisonment for not less than 30 days and not more than 12
months. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 189.990 (9)(a) (Supp. 1974).
2A
second-class city (population 20,000-100,000) police judge
must be at least 25, a resident of the city for four years, and an
attorney at law. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26.150 (Supp. 1974). A
third-class city (population 8,000-20,000) and a fourth-class city
(population 3,000-8,000) police judge must be at least 24 and a
city resident. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26.190 (1971).

NORTH v. RUSSELL
328

Opinion of the Court

In fourth-, fifth-, or sixth-class cities police judges may
be either appointed or elected.' Ky. Const. § 160.
Police courts have jurisdiction, concurrent with circuit courts, of penal and misdemeanor cases punishable
by a fine of not more than $500 and/or imprisonment of
not more than 12 months. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 26.010
(1971). Kentucky has a two-tier misdemeanor court
system. An appeal of right is provided from the decision
of a police judge to the circuit court where all judges are
lawyers, and in that court a jury trial de novo may be
had. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23.032 (1971); Ky. Rule
Crim. Proc. 12.06.
Appellant did not appeal to the Kentucky circuit court
for a trial de novo to which he was entitled. After being
sentenced by appellee judge, appellant challenged the
statutory scheme described above by a writ of habeas
corpus in the Harlan County Circuit Court, where he was
3 The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky at its
1974 session, by Senate Bill 183, enacted an Act proposing an
amendment to the Kentucky Constitution relating to the judicial
branch of government. On November 4, 1975, the Kentucky voters
ratified the judicial amendment to the Kentucky Constitution,
effective January 1, 1976. It provides, in part, that by January 1,
1978, all the county, quarterly, justice of the peace, and police
courts will be combined into one district court in each of the 120
counties. These counties are to be allocated among 55 districts and
each district is to elect at least one district judge who must be an
attorney licensed in Kentucky. A district judge in multicounty
districts must appoint a trial commissioner for each county in
which no district judge resides. The commissioner must be an
attorney if one is qualified and available. The commissioner will
have the power to perform such duties of the district court as
may be prescribed by the Kentucky Supreme Court.
The case is not mooted by this judicial amendment since the
police courts will continue to function as challenged until January 1,
1978, and since the new amendment still permits nonlawyer judges
to sit. These judges may have power to impose prison sentences if
the Kentucky Supreme Court so provides.

Opinion of the Court

represented by an attorney. Appellant contended that
his federal due process and equal protection rights had
been abridged because he had been tried and convicted in
a court presided over by a judge without legal training
and thus without legal competence. The State Circuit
Court issued the writ, granted bail, and held an evidentiary hearing.
The Circuit Court noted that appellant was not challenging the adequacy of the proceedings before appellee
Russell, and hence rested on the appellant's pleadings,
which the court found were purposefully limited to the
issue whether appellant could be tried before a judge
who was not legally trained when persons similarly
situated but residing in larger cities would be tried by a
judge trained in the law. The Circuit Court denied relief on the basis of the Kentucky Court of Appeals holding in Ditty v. Hampton, 490 S. W. 2d 772 (1972), appeal dismissed, 414 U. S. 885 (1973). The Kentucky
Court of Appeals in turn affirmed the denial of relief on
the basis of Ditty v. Hampton, supra, noting that appellant could apply for bail in the event of an appeal from
the Lynch Police Court judgment. 516 S. W. 2d 103
(1974).
When this case first came here on appeal we vacated
the judgment and remanded it "for further consideration in light of the position presently asserted by
The
the Commonwealth." 419 U. S. 1085 (1974).
Attorney General of Kentucky in his motion to dismiss
or affirm had requested that this Court remand the case
to the Kentucky Court of Appeals for consideration of
violations of state law based on the suggestion that appellee judge had "mistakenly imposed a sentence of imprisonment upon appellant for a first offense of driving
while intoxicated, whereas imprisonment is not an authorized punishment for first offenders . . . ." The

NORTH v. RUSSELL

Opinion of the Court

Kentucky Attorney General conceded that the writ of
habeas corpus should have been granted and requested
an opportunity to correct the error.

On remand, however, the Kentucky Court of Appeals
declined to decide the case on the state grounds presented

by the Attorney General, noting that the federal constitutional issue "was and is the only issue before us."

That court noted that appellant sought only to "test
the constitutional status of lay judges in criminal cases."
No. 74-723 (Mar. 21, 1975).
On the second appeal to this Court we noted probable
jurisdiction. 422 U. S. 1040 (1975).

Appellant's first claim is that when confinement is a
possible penalty, a law-trained judge is required by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
whether or not a trial de novo before a lawyer-judge is
available.
4 Article III of the United States Constitution, of course, unlike
provisions of some state constitutions, see, e. g., N. Y. Const., Art. 6,
§ 20 (a); S. D. Const., Art. 5, §§ 10, 25, is silent as to any requirement that judges of the United States' courts, including Justices of
the Supreme Court, be lawyers or "learned in the law." We note
that in excess of 95% of all criminal cases in England are tried
before lay judicial officers. See D. Karlen, Judicial Administration:
The American Experience 32 (1970) ; H. Abraham, The Judicial Process 246-247, and n. 4 (2d ed. 1968). We also note that many of the
States in the United States which utilize nonlawyer judges provide
mandatory or voluntary training programs, see, e. g., Iowa Code Ann.
§ 602.50 (6) (1975); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 49:251.1 (Supp. 1976);
Miss. Code Ann. §§ 7-5-59, 9-11-3 (1972); Mont. Rev. Codes Ann.
§ 93-401 (Supp. 1975); Nov. Rev. Stat. § 5.026 (1973); N. Y. Uniform Justice Court Act § 105 (Supp. 1975-1976); N. C. Sess.
Laws, c. 956, § 11 (1975); N. D. Cent. Code § 27-18-08 (Interim Supp. 1975); Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 42, § 1214 (Supp. 19761977); Utah Code Ann. § 78-5-27 (Supp. 1975); and training

OCTOBER TERM, 1975
Opinion of the Court

427 U. S.

It must be recognized that there is a wide gap between
the functions of a judge of a court of general jurisdiction, dealing with complex litigation, and the functions
of a local police court judge trying a typical "drunk"
driver case or other traffic violations. However, once it
appears that confinement is an available penalty, the
process commands scrutiny. See Argersinger v. Hamlin,
407 U. S.25 (1972).
Appellant argues that the right to counsel articulated
in Argersinger v. Hamlin, supra, and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), is meaningless without a
lawyer-judge to understand the arguments of counsel.
Appellant also argues that the increased complexity of
substantive and procedural criminal law requires that
all judges now be lawyers in order to be able to rule correctly on the intricate issues lurking even in some simple
misdemeanor cases. In the context of the Kentucky
procedures, however, it is unnecessary to reach the question whether a defendant could be convicted and imprisoned after a proceeding in which the only trial afforded is conducted by a lay judge. In all instances,
a defendant in Kentucky facing a criminal sentence is
afforded an opportunity to be tried de novo in a court
presided over by a lawyer-judge since an appeal automatically vacates the conviction in police court. Ky.
Rev. Stat. Ann. § 23.032 (1971); Ky. Rule Crim. Proc.
manuals, see, e. g., G.Brownlee, The Montana Justice of the Peace
and Police Judge (1970). The brief of amicus curiae New York
State Association of Magistrates informs us that, of the States
that have nonlawyer judges, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, and
Wyoming have mandatory training programs, and Alaska, Georgia,
Kanlas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hamsphire, Oregon,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wisconsin have voluntary training programs.

NORTH v. RUSSELL
328

Opinion of the Court

12.06. The trial de novo is available after either a trial
or a plea of guilty in the police court; a defendant is
entitled to bail while awaiting the trial de novo. 516
S. W. 2d 103 (1974).
It is obvious that many defendants charged with a
traffic violation or other misdemeanor may be uncounseled when they appear before the police court. They
may be unaware of their right to a de novo trial after
a judgment is entered since the decision is likely to be
prompt. We assume that police court judges recognize
their obligation under Arg-ersinger v. Hamlin, supra,
to inform defendants of their right to a lawyer if a
sentence of confinement is to be imposed. The appellee
judge testified that informing defendants of a right to
counsel was "the standard procedure." App. 32. We
also assume that police court judges in Kentucky recognize their obligation to inform all convicted defendants,
including those who waived counsel or for whom imprisonment was not imposed, of their unconditional right
to a trial de novo and of the necessity that an "appeal"
be filed within 30 days in order to implement that right.
Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.04.
In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), we considered Kentucky's two-tier system there challenged on
other grounds. We noted:
"The right to a new trial is absolute. A defendant
need not allege error in the inferior court proceeding.
If he seeks a new trial, the Kentucky statutory
scheme contemplates that the slate be wiped clean.
Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.06. Prosecution and defense begin anew. .

.

. The case is to be regarded

exactly as if it had been brought there in the first
instance." Id., at 113.
We went on to note that the justifications urged by

OCTOBER TERM, 1975
Opinion of the Court

427 U. S.

States for continuing such tribunals' are the "increasing burdens on state judiciaries" and the "interest of
both the defendant. and the State, to provide speedier
and less costly adjudications" than those provided in
courts "where the full range of constitutional guarantees
is available . . . ." Id., at 114. Moreover, state policy
takes into account that it is a convenience to those
charged to be tried in or near their own community,
rather than travel to a distant court where a law-trained
judge is provided, and to have the option, as here, of a
trial after regular business hours. We took note of
these practical considerations in Colten:
"We are not persuaded, however, that the Kentucky
arrangement for dealing with the less serious offenses
disadvantages defendants any more or any less than
trials conducted in a court of general jurisdiction in
the first instance, as long as the latter are always
available. Proceedings in the inferior courts are
simple and speedy, and, if the results in Colten's
case are any evidence, the penalty is not characteristically severe. Such proceedings offer a defendant
the opportunity to learn about the prosecution's
case and, if he chooses, he need not reveal his own.
He may also plead guilty without a trial and
promptly secure a de novo trial in a court of general criminal jurisdiction." Id., at 118-119.
s We observed in Colten v. Kentucky that in the first-tier
tribunals, "[s]ome [States], including Kentucky, do not record proceedings and the judges may not be trained for their positions either by experience or schooling." 407 U. S., at 114. We took
note of the Kentucky Court of Appeals' comment that "'the inferior
courts are not designed or equipped to conduct error-free trials, or
to insure full recognition of constitutional freedoms. They are
courts of convenience, to provide speedy and inexpensive means of
disposition of charges of minor offenses.' Colten v. Commonwealth,

467 S. W. 2d, at 379."

Id., at 117.

NORTH v. RUSSELL
328

Opinion of the Court

Under Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57,
61-62 (1972), appellant argues that he is entitled to a
lawyer-judge in the first instance. There the judge
was also mayor and the village received a substantial portion of its income from fines imposed by him as
judge. Similarly in Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510
(1927), the challenge was directed not at the training or
education of the judge but at his possible bias due to
interest in the outcome of the case, because as in Monroeville he was both mayor and judge and received a
portion of his compensation directly from the fines.
Financial interest in the fines was thought to risk a
possible bias in finding guilt and fixing the amount of
fines, and the Court found that potential for bias
impermissible.
Under the Kentucky system, as we noted in Colten, a
defendant can have an initial trial before a lawyer-judge
by pleading guilty in the police court, thus bypassing that
court and seeking the de novo trial, "erasing . . . any
consequence that would otherwise follow from tendering
the [guilty] plea." 407 U. S., at 119-120.
Our concern in prior cases with judicial functions being performed by nonjudicial officers has also been directed at the need for independent, neutral, and detached
judgment, not at legal training. See Coolidge v. New
Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443, 449-453 (1971). See also,
e. g., Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U. S. 560, 564 (1971);
Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 356 (1967);
Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U. S. 471, 481-482
(1963). Yet cases such as Shadwick v. City of Tampa,
407 U. S. 345 (1972), are relevant; lay magistrates and
other judicial officers empowered to issue warrants must
deal with evaluation of such legal concepts as probable
cause and the sufficiency of warrant affidavits. Indeed,

OCTOBER TERM, 1975

in Shadwick the probable-cause evaluation made by the
lay magistrate related to a charge of "impaired driving."
(3)
Appellant's second claim is that Kentucky's constitutional provisions classifying cities by population and its
statutory provisions permitting lay judges to preside in
some cities while requiring law-trained judges in others
denies him the equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. However, all people within a given
city and within cities of the same size are treated equally.
The Kentucky Court of Appeals in Ditty v. Hampton,
supra, articulated reasons for the differing qualifications
of police court judges in cities of different size:
"1. The greater volume of court business in the
larger cities requires that judges be attorneys to enable the courts to operate efficiently and expeditiously (not necessarily with more fairness and
impartiality).
"2. Lawyers with whom to staff the courts are
more available in the larger cities.
"3. The larger cities have greater financial resources with which to provide better qualified personnel and better facilities for the courts." 490
S. W. 2d, at 776.
That court then noted: "That population and area
factors may justify classifications within a court system has long been recognized." Id., at 776-777. The
Court of Appeals relied upon Missouri v. Lewis, 101
6 In Shadwick we cautioned:
"[O]ur federal system warns of converting desirable practice into
constitutional commandment. It recognizes in plural and diverse
state activities one key to national innovation and vitality. States
" 407 U. S., at
are entitled to some flexibility and leeway ....

U. S. 22 (1880), which held that as long as all people
within the classified area are treated equally:
"Each State .

.

. may establish one system of courts

for cities and another for rural districts, one system
for one portion of its territory and another system
for another portion. Convenience, if not necessity,
often requires this to be done, and it would seriously
interfere with the power of a State to regulate its
internal affairs to deny to it this right." Id., at
30-31.

Goldin, 400 F. Supp. 23 (EDNY 1975) (three-judge
court), summarily aff'd, 423 U. S. 1068 (1976).
We conclude that the Kentucky two-tier trial court
system with lay judicial officers in the first tier in smaller
cities and an appeal of right with a de novo trial before a
traditionally law-trained judge in the second does not
violate either the due process or equal protection guarantees of the Constitution of the United States; accordingly the judgment before us is

whatever.1 I believe that a trial before such a judge
that results in the imprisonment of the defendant is
constitutionally intolerable. It deprives the accused of
his right to the effective assistance of counsel guaranteed
by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, and deprives
him as well of due process of law.2
The judge at North's state habeas corpus hearing concluded:
"I think the fact has been established that [Judge Russell is] not a
lawyer, he doesn't know any law, he hasn't studied any law."
Judge Russell testified that he had only a high school education.
He had never received any training concerning his duties as a
lay judge. This is not a case, therefore, involving a lay judge who
has received the kind of special training that several States apparently provide. See ante, at 333-334, n. 4.
A study of California's lay judges made in 1972 showed that

37% had no education beyond high school while 13% had even less
formal education. Gordon v. Justice Court, 12 Cal. 3d 323, 330 n. 7,
525 P. 2d 72, 76 n. 7. A 1966 survey revealed that only 5% of Virginia's justices of the peace were college graduates, Note, 52 Va. L.
Rev. 151, 177, while in 1958 one-half of West Virginia's justices had
not completed high school, Note, 69 W. Va. L. Rev. 314, 323. In
1969, the Assistant Attorney General of Mississippi told the State's
Judiciary Commission that "33% of the justices of the peace are
limited in educational background to the extent that they are
not capable of learning the necessary elements of law." Hearings on
Justice of the Peace Courts and Judges before the Mississippi
Judiciary Commission (testimony of R. Hugo Newcomb, Sr.), quoted
in Comment, 44 Miss. L. J. 996, 1000 n. 31 (1973).
2At least two state courts have held that such a trial violates
the United States Constitution. Gordon v. Justice Court, supra;
Shelmidine v. Jones, No. 224948 (Utah 3d Jud. Dist., June 3,
1975).
Contemporary studies of American court systems have been
unanimous in calling for the elimination of nonlawyer judges. See

STE.WART, J., dissenting

I
A
The reasons why a defendant in a criminal trial needs
a lawyer to assist in his defense have nowhere been better
put than in the oft-quoted words of Mr. Justice Sutherland's opinion for the Court in Powell v. Alabama, 287
U. S. 45:
"The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of
little avail if it did not comprehend the right to
be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in
the science of law. If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself
whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without
the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a
proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise
inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though
he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding
hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings
against him. Without it, though he be not guilty,
he faces the danger of conviction because he does
not know how to establish his innocence." Id., at
68-69.
So it was that, beginning with the capital case of
Powell v. Alabama, supra, extending through the felony
case of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, and culminating in the misdemeanor case of Argersinger v. Ham(1967); Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, StateLocal Relations in the Criminal Justice System, Recommendation 21
(1971); Consensus Statement of the National Conference on the
Judiciary, 55 J. Am. Jud. Soc. 29, 30 (1971).

lin, 407 U. S. 25, the Court's decisions firmly established
that a person who has not been accorded the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel cannot be sentenced to even one day of imprisonment.
But the essential presupposition of this basic constitutional right is that the judge conducting the trial will be
able to understand what the defendant's lawyer is talking
about. For if the judge himself is ignorant of the law,
then he, too, will be incapable of determining whether the
charge "is good or bad." He, too, will be "unfamiliar
with the rules of evidence."
And a lawyer for the
3 Judge Russell testified that he had not received any training
concerning rules of evidence and that he was not familiar with the
Kentucky statutes relating to jury trials, with the Kentucky rules
of criminal procedure, or with the rights guaranteed to a defendant
in a criminal case under the Fourteenth Amendment.
The deposition of a lay magistrate in a South Carolina case provides another illustration of the inadequate legal background of
nonlawyer judges:
"Q. What books do you have . . . that deal with the duties of
Magistrate?"
Magistrate MeLendon: "I got a stack of volume books from the
courthouse when I got the job, little red books.
"Q. What books are those sir, do you know the names of
them?"
Magistrate McLendon: "No, sir.

"Q. Tell me what your understanding of the Code of Laws is,
what is contained in the Code of Laws, as you understand?"
Magistrate McLendon: "Well I never have done any reading

defendant will be able to do little or nothing to prevent
an unjust conviction. In a trial before such a judge, the
constitutional right to the assistance of counsel thus
becomes a hollow mockery-"a teasing illusion like a
munificent bequest in a pauper's will." Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160, 186 (Jackson, J., concurring).

In this case Judge Russell denied a motion for trial
by jury, although under Kentucky law North was clearly
entitled to a jury trial upon request. Ky. Co nst. § 11;
Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 25.014, 26.400 (1971).
And
after finding North guilty, Judge Russell proceeded to
impose a sentence of imprisonment, although such a
sentence was clearly unauthorized by Kentucky law.
Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§189.520 (2), 189.990 (10) (a)
(1971).
But even if it were not possible to demonstrate in a
particular case that the lay judge had been incompetent or the trial egregiously unfair, I think that any
trial before a lay judge that results in the defendant's
imprisonment violates the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has never required
a showing of specific or individualized prejudice when it
was the procedure itself that violated due process of
law. "[A]t times a procedure employed by the State
involves such a probability that prejudice will result
that it is deemed inherently lacking in due process."

Louisiana, 373 U. S. 723; Hamilton v. Alabama, 368

justice, in the broadest sense of that term, is achieved in
every criminal trial." Faretta v. California, 422 U. S.

United States, 425 U. S. 80, 86-87. Among the critical
functions that a trial judge must frequently perform are
the acceptance of a guilty plea, Henderson v. Morgan,
426 U. S. 637; the determination of the voluntariness of
a confession, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368; the advising of the defendant of his trial rights, Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238; and the instruction of a jury, Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607, 612. A judge
ignorant of the law is simply incapable of performing
these functions. If he is aware of his incompetence,
such a judge will perhaps instinctively turn to the prosecutor for advice and direction.' But such a practice no
more than compounds the due process violation. See
In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136.'
The Kentucky Court of Appeals characterized the kind
of trial that took place here as an "absurdity." The trial,
4 Judge Russell conceded that he relied on the city attorney for
legal advice:
"Q. Prior to your appointment as City Judge . . . had you had
any previous legal experience of any kind?"
Judge Russell: "No, sir.
"Q. Have you had any legal training of any kind since your
appointment?"
Judge Russell: "Well, the only thing I can say, if I have any
doubt, I just consult with the city lawyer .

"Q. And when you receive advice from the city attorney, do
you follow that advice?"
Judge Russell: "Yes, sir."

1974, p. 116 in Frierson v. West, Civ. No. 74-1074, (SC May 15,

come to Mr. George Stuckey [the county attorney] and find
out what I had to do").

in my view, was such an absurdity as to constitute a gross
denial of due process of law.6
II
The Court seems to say that these constitutional deficiencies can all be swept under the rug and forgotten
because the convicted defendant may have a trial de novo
before a qualified judge. I cannot agree.
In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57, the
Court made clear that "the State's trial court procedure
[cannot] be deemed constitutionally acceptable simply
because the State eventually offers a defendant an impartial adjudication. Petitioner is entitled to a neutral
and detached judge in the first instance." Id., at 61-62.
See also Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 (right to trial
by jury is right to a jury in first instance).
The Court would distinguish the Ward case as "directed at the need for independent, neutral, and detached
judgment, not at legal training." Ante, at 337. But
surely there can be no meaningful constitutional difference between a trial that is fundamentally unfair because
of the judge's possible bias, and one that is fundamentally
unfair because of the judge's ignorance of the law.'
The scarcity of lawyers or legally trained persons in rural areas
cannot serve to justify trials such as this. Utah, to cite one
example, has managed to devise a constitutionally adequate trial
system even though large portions of the State are sparsely populated and 13 of its 29 counties have two or fewer lawyers. See
Utah House Bill No. 1, 1975 First Special Session, amending Utah
Code Ann. § 78-5-4. See generally Note, 10 Harv. Civ. RightsCiv. Lib. L. Rev. 739, 763-767 (1975).
7The Court's reliance on Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, is
misplaced. The question in Colten was not whether a trial of the
kind challenged here is constitutionally valid, but the quite different
question whether a greater sentence can be imposed on a defendant
following a trial de novo without violating North Carolinav. Pearce,
395 U. S, 711.

And the Court's suggestion that a defendant haled before a lay judge can protect his constitutional rights by
simply pleading guilty and immediately seeking a trial
de novo is wholly unpersuasive. First, this argument assumes without any factual support that the defendant
will be informed of his right to a trial de novo.8 Second,
the procedure would still necessitate multiple court appearances, at the cost of both delay and an increased
financial burden for attorneys' fees and court costs.
Third, such a practice would turn what should be a solemn court proceeding, see Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.
238, into nothing more than a sham. In short, I cannot
accept the suggestion that, as a prerequisite to a constitutionally fair trial, a defendant must stand up in open
court and inform a judge that he is guilty when in fact
he believes that he is not.
At Runnymede in 1215 King John pledged to his
barons that he would "not make any Justiciaries, Constables, Sheriffs, or Bailiffs, excepting of such as know
the laws of the land . . . ." Magna Carta 45. Today,
more than 750 years later, the Court leaves that promise unkept.
I respectfully dissent.

The record indicates that North was taken to jail immediately

after sentencing and obtained his freedom only when the state
habeas corpus court on the following day signed a writ ordering
his release. It is hardly likely that North would have spent the
night in jail if he had been told that he could avoid jail simply by
asking for a trial de novo.
The Court also states its assumption that Kentucky police court
judges will advise defendants of their right to counsel and that
counsel will advise their clients of their right to a trial de novo.
See ante, at 335. This assumption is also devoid of support in
the present record. Although Judge Russell stated that it was
"the standard procedure"' to advise defendants of their right to
counsel, he was unwilling to state that he advised North of this
right, and North unreservedly testified that he was not so advised.
