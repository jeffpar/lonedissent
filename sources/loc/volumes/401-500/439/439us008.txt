OCTOBER TERM, 1978
Per Curiam

439 U. S.

CAREY, STATE'S ATTORNEY OF COOK COUNTY,

ILLINOIS v. WYNN

ET AL.

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS

No. 78-229. Decided October 16, 1978*
This Court has no jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1253 over appeals from
a three-judge District Court's declaratory judgment invalidating certain
state statutory provisions, such judgment being appealable only to the
Court of Appeals.
Appeals dismissed. Reported below: 449 F. Supp. 1302.
PER CURIAM.

A three-judge District Court entered a declaratory judgment
holding unconstitutional certain sections of the Illinois Abortion Act of 1975, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, § 81-21 et seq. (Supp.
1976). Wynn v. Scott, 449 F. Supp. 1302 (ND Ill. 1978).
The District Court assumed that Illinois prosecutors would
recognize and abide by the declaratory judgment and denied
plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. Id., at 1331.
The appeals from the declaratory judgment invalidating
certain provisions of the statute are dismissed for want of
jurisdiction. Title 28 U. S. C. § 1253, the jurisdictional statute
under which these appeals are taken, does not authorize an
appeal from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone.
Gerstein v. Coe, 417 U. S. 279 (1974). The declaratory
judgment is appealable to the Court of Appeals, and we are
informed that appeals to that court have been taken.
Appears dismissed.
MR. JUSTIcE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or
decision of these cases.
*Together with No. 78-239, Diamond v. Wynn et al., also on appeal
from the same court.
