BUCHANAN FT AL. v. EVANS ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-188. Decided September 1, 1978
Application to stay, pending the filing of a petition for certiorari, Court

of Appeals' judgment and mandate affirming District Court's order
prescribing a school desegregation plan for Wilmington, Del., and suburban districts, is denied. The record is replete with findings that de jure
segregation has not been dismantled, thus (contrary to the situation
in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406) justifying
the District Court's extensive interdistrict remedy. Hence, it does not
appear that four Justices of this Court would vote to grant certiorari
or that the balance of equities favors applicant.

Circuit Justice.
The Delaware State Board of Education and eight intervening defendant suburban school districts' request that I
stay execution of the judgment and mandate of the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit in this case pending consideration by this Court of their petition for certiorari. The judgment affirmed an order of the District Court for the District
of Delaware prescribing a school desegregation plan involving
MR. JusTi FCBRBNNAN,

'Pursuant to the desegregation order of the United States District Court
for the District of Delaware these eight suburban school districts, along
with three others, were abolished as of July 1, 1978, and replaced by a
single unified school district administered by the New Castle County Board
of Education. The District Court, however, granted the suburban school
districts limited legal status "for the limited purpose of pursuing rights
of appeal or judicial review." 447 F. Supp. 982, 1039 (1978). Applicants do not now request that the order abolishing these school districts
be stayed. "The independent school districts having been dissolved effective July 1, 1978, [applicants] believe that any attempt to reconstitute
those districts and to operate them separately at this late date would be
more disruptive than to permit the single judicial district to operate at
least for the current school year." Application for Stay 8.

the city of Wilmington and 11 surrounding suburban school
districts.2
In deciding whether to grant a stay pending disposition of
a petition for certiorari, I must consider two factors.
"First, 'a Circuit Justice should "balance the equities" ...
and determine on which side the risk of irreparable injury
weighs most heavily.' Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U. S.

1304, 1308-1309 (1973)

(MARaSHALL,

J., in chambers).

Second, assuming a balance of equities in favor of the
applicant, the Circuit Justice must also determine whether
'it is likely that four Members of this Court would vote to
grant a writ of certiorari.' Id., at 1310. The burden of
persuasion as to both of these issues rests on the applicant . .. ." Beame v. Friends of the Earth, 434 U. S.

1310, 1312 (1977)

(MARISHALL,

J., in chambers).

That burden is "particularly heavy," ibid., when, as here, a
stay has been denied both by the District Court and unanimously by the Court of Appeals sitting en bane.
The thrust of applicants' position is that the desegregation
plan ordered by the District Court and approved by the Court
of Appeals is administratively and financially onerous, and
that it is inconsistent with the precepts enunciated in Dayton
Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406 (1977).3
2 Applicants request a stay of so much of the District Court's order as
compels mandatory pupil and staff reassignment as well as other forms of
ancillary relief. See ibid.; id., Exhibit A, pp. 10-13.
3 Applicants also contend that since the District Court's order entails
"the extinction of eleven historic, independent political entities of the State
of Delaware," it "constitutes an unprecedented exercise of judicial power
which should be reviewed by this Court pursuant to certiorari." Application for Stay 11. Applicants, however, do not seek to stay that aspect
of the District Court's order that abolishes the 11 school districts;
indeed, applicants state that they will not suffer an irreparable injury if
this aspect of the order is not presently stayed. See n. 1, supra. Were
a grant of certiorari appropriate to this issue, any relief pertinent if
applicants were to prevail as to this claim would in my view be distinct

Dayton vacated the order of a Court of Appeals which had
"imposed a remedy ...entirely out of proportion to the constitutional violations found by the District Court .... ." Id.,
at 418. The District Court had found only "three separate ... relatively isolated instances of unconstitutional action
on the part of petitioners," id., at 413, but the Court of Appeals had nevertheless ordered a systemwide remedy. Dayton
invoked the familiar "rule laid down in Swann, and elaborated
upon in Hills v. Gautreaux, 425 'L. S. 284 (1976)," that
"'[o]nce a constitutional violation is found, a federal court
is required to tailor "the scope of the remedy" to fit "the
nature and extent of the constitutional violation." 418 U. S.,
at 744; Swann [v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Education,
402 U. S. ], at 16.' [Hills v. Gautreaux,425 U. S.,] at 293294." Id., at 419-420. Applying this rule, Dayton required
the District Court on remand to determine the "incremental
segregative effect [constitutional] violations had on the racial
distribution of the Dayton school population as presently constituted, when that distribution is compared to what it would
have been in the absence of such constitutional violations.
The remedy must be designed to redress that difference, and
only if there has been a systemwide impact may there be a
systemwide remedy. Keyes, 413 U. S., at 213." Id., at 420.
The facts of Dayton are fundamentally different from the
circumstances presented by this application. Segregation in
Delaware, unlike that in Ohio, was mandated by law until
1954.1 In the instant case the District Court found that "at
from the relief presently requested by applicants.

See n. 2, supra.

Consideration of this contention is therefore not relevant to my determination as to whether to grant a stay.
- A lineal ancestor of the present case was Gebhartv. Belton, 33 Del. Ch.
144, 91 A. 2d 137 (1952), in which the Delaware Supreme Court ordered
the immediate admission of black children to certain schools previously
attended only by whites. The case was appealed to this Court and consolidated and decided with Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.483
(1954). The instant case has been in the federal courts at least since

BUCHANAN v. EVANS

Opinion in Chambers

that time . . . Wilmington and suburban districts were not
meaningfully 'separate and autonomous'" because "de jure
segregation in New Castle County was a cooperative venture
involving both city and suburbs." 393 F. Supp. 428, 437
(1975). So far from finding only isolated examples of unconstitutional action, the District Court in this case concluded
"that segregated schooling in Wilmington has never been
eliminated and that there still exists a dual school system." 379 F. Supp. 1218, 1223 (1974). The District Court
found that this dual school system has been perpetuated
through constitutional violations of an interdistrict nature, '
necessitating for their rectification an interdistrict remedy.
See 393 F. Supp. 428 (1975). See also 416 F. Supp. 328,
338-341 (1976). The District Court's finding of these interdistrict violations was summarily affirmed by this Court,
423 U. S. 963 (1975), and it thus constitutes the law of the
case for purposes of this stay application. Unlike the situation in Dayton, therefore, the record before the Court of
Appeals in the instant case was replete with findings justifying, if not requiring, the extensive interdistrict remedy ordered by the District Court.
Applicants argue, however, that the order of the District
Court violates the principles of Dayton because no findings
were made as to "incremental segregative effect." But even
assuming that such an analysis were appropriate when, as
here, there is an explicit finding that a de jure school system

(Del. 1976).

The District Court concluded that an interdistrict remedy would be
appropriate, based on its findings that:
"1) there had been a failure to alter the historic pattern of inter-district
segregation in Northern New Castle County;
"2) governmental authorities at the state and local levels were responsible
to a significant degree for increasing the disparity in residential and school
populations between Wilmington and the suburbs;
"3) the City of Wilmington had been unconstitutionally excluded from

has never been dismantled,6 the remedy of the District Court
was consciously fashioned to implement the familiar rule of
Swann and Gautreaux that equitable relief should be tailored
to fit the violation. "Our duty," stated the District Court in
1976, "is to order a remedy which will place the victims of
the violation in substantially the position which they would
have occupied had the violation not occurred." 416 F. Supp.,
at 341. And, as the District Court most recently stated:
"[T]he firmly established constitutional violations in
this case are the perpetuation of a dual school system and
the vestige effects of pervasive de jure inter-district segregation. Evans v. Buchanan, 416 F. Supp. at 343; 393 F.
Supp. at 432-438, 445, 447. Dayton reaffirms that
'[o] nce a constitutional violation is found, a federal court
is required to tailor "the scope of the remedy" to fit "the
nature and extent of the constitutional violation."'

Eradication of the
constitutional violation to the scope and extent enumerated by the three-judge court is all that any of the
plans and concepts submitted purport to accomplish, and
that is all the concept endorsed by the Court does accomplish." 447 F. Supp. 982, 1011 (1978) (footnote

other school districts by the State Board of Education, pursuant to a
withholding of reorganization powers under the Delaware Educational
Advancement Act of 1968." Id., at 877.
The court specifically found that "the acts of the State and its subdivisions . . . had a substantial, not a de minimis, effect on the enrollment

patterns of the separate districts." 416 F. Supp. 328, 339 (Del. 1976).

strenuous insistence upon such a narrow reading of the
phrase "incremental segregative effect" entangles them in a contradiction.
Before the District Court they took the position that "'it is not "feasible"

The Court of Appeals accepted the principles of this analysis,
and approved their application by the District Court. See
Application for Stay, Exhibit B, p. 22; 555 F. 2d 373, 379-380
(CA3 1977). In these circumstances, I find no violation of
the principles of Dayton sufficient to justify the conclusion
that four Justices of this Court would vote to grant certiorari.
Applicants strenuously urge that irreparable financial and
administrative difficulties attend upon the District Court's
order. But both the District Court and the Court of Appeals,
sitting en banc, have rejected this contention and concluded
that, balancing the equities of this protracted litigation, applicants are not entitled to a stay. The judgments of these
Courts are entitled to great deference. See Board of Educatioan of New Rochelle v. Taylor, 82 S. Ct. 10, 11 (1961)
(BRENNAN, J., in chambers).
"It is clear that the . . .
Court of Appeals gave full consideration to a similar motion
and with a. much fuller knowledge than we can have, denied
it. As we have said, we require very cogent reasons before
we will disregard the deliberate action of that court in such
a matter." Magnum Import Co. v. Coty, 262 U. S. 159, 164
(1923).
The "devastating, often irreparable, injury to those children
who experience segregation and isolation was noted [24] years
ago in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)."
,efferson Parish School Board v. Dandridge, 404 U. S. 1219,
1220 (1971) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers). This case has
been in continuous litigation for the past 21 years. As my
Brother MARSHALL stated seven years ago when asked to stay
a school desegregation order:
"Whatever progress toward desegregation has been made
to determine what the affected school districts and school populations

would be today "but for" the constitutional violations found by the threejudge court and affirmed on appeal.'" 447 F. Supp., at 1010 n. 123.
The end result of applicants' positions is thus apparently that no equitable
remedy would be appropriate.

apparently, and unfortunately, derives only from judicial action initiated by those persons situated as perpetual plaintiffs below. The rights of children to equal
educational opportunities are not to be denied, even for a
brief time, simply because a school board situates itself so
as to make desegregation difficult." Ibid.
In such circumstances, I cannot conclude that the balance
of equities lies in favor of applicants. The application for a
stay is accordingly denied.
