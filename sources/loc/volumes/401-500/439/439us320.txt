OCTOBER TERM, 1978
Per Curiam

439 U. S.

MOBAY CHEMICAL CORP. v. COSTLE, ADMINISTRATRATOR, UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY
ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

WESTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI

No. 78-308. Decided January 8, 1979
Appeal from a three-judge District Court's judgment rejecting appellant's
constitutional attack on § 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act, governing registration of pesticides, is dismissed for
want of jurisdiction, where it appears that the attack was, as a legal
matter, on agency practice, not on the statute, and, thus, that the threejudge court was improperly convened.
PER CURIAM.

Appellant contends that the use of one submitter's data,
filed prior to 1970, in the consideration of another person's
application for registration of pesticides under § 3 of the
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
as added by the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act
of 1972, 86 Stat. 979, and as amended, 89 Stat. 755, 7 U. S. C.
§ 136a, effects a taking for private use and without compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and that the Act is to that extent invalid. A
three-judge court was convened under former 28 U. S. C.
§ 2282 (1970 ed.) and proceeded to reject these contentions.
Appellant seeks to appeal directly to this Court. Having
examined the Act and the papers before us, however, we are
convinced that whatever may be true with respect to data
submitted after January 1, 1970, the FIFRA, as amended,
does not at all address the issues of the conditions under
which pre-1970 data may be used in considering another
application. It neither authorizes, forbids, nor requires the
existing agency practice with respect to pre-1970 data. As a
legal matter, then, appellant's attack is on agency practice,

not on the statute. The three-judge court was thus improperly convened, William Jameson & Co. v. Morgenthau, 307
U. S. 171, 173-174 (1939), and this Court does not have
jurisdiction to entertain a direct appeal from the judgment in
such case. See 28 U. S. C. § 1253; Norton v. Mathews, 427
U. S. 524, 528-530 (1976). The appeal is accordingly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
So ordered.

tR. JuSTicE BLACEMUN, dissenting.
I am of the view that the 1975 amendments to FIFRA
specifically address the practices of the EPA and permit and
ratify them. The constitutionality of the statute is therefore
necessarily drawn into question in this lawsuit. See Flast v.
Cohei, 392 U. S. 83, 88-91, and n. 3 (1968). I therefore conclude that the three-judge District Court was properly convened. On the merits, I would affirm the judgment of the
District Court.
