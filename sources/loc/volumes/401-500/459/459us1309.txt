CONFORTE v. COMMISSIONER

Opinion in Chambers

CONFORTE v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL
REVENUE
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-584.

Decided January 12, 1983

An application for a stay, pending the filing and disposition of a petition for
certiorari, of the Court of Appeals' judgment-which dismissed applicant's appeal from the Tax Court's determination upholding the Internal
Revenue Service's calculations of taxes due from applicant and his wifeis denied. Relying on Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365, the Court
of Appeals had dismissed applicant's appeal because he was a fugitive
from justice for federal convictions, but ruled that he could move to reinstate his appeal if he submitted himself within a specified number of days
to the District Court from which he was a fugitive. Although absent a
stay, applicant may be injured because the period for surrendering expired on the day that he filed his application for a stay, nevertheless a
stay is not appropriate since there is no reasonable possibility that four
Justices will vote to grant certiorari to consider whether Molinaro
should apply only to appeals from criminal convictions and not to appeals
in civil cases, as here.

Circuit Justice.
This controversy began when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued tax deficiencies and penalties against applicant and his wife for the years 1973 through 1976. The
Confortes filed tax returns for the years in question stating a
"net income," but without disclosing their gross income and
deductions; they claimed these details would be incriminating. Based on projections of income and expenses, the IRS
determined that the Confortes had a greater tax liability than
their "net income" revealed.
The Confortes petitioned to the Tax Court for a redetermination. That court sustained the calculations made by the
IRS. 74 T. C. 1160 (1980). Pursuant to 26 U. S. C. ยง7482
(1976 ed. and Supp. V), the Confortes appealed to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On November 5, 1982, the Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reJUSTICE REHNQUIST,

versed in part as to Mrs. Conforte. 692 F. 2d 587. Applicant's appeal, however, was dismissed. Applicant seeks a
stay of that dismissal.
The Court of Appeals found that applicant is a fugitive
from justice for convictions on four counts of willfully attempting to evade federal employment taxes. See United
States v. Conforte, 624 F. 2d 869 (CA9 1980). Relying on
this Court's decision in Molinaro v. New Jersey, 396 U. S.
365 (1970) (percuriam), the court held that as a fugitive from
justice applicant should not be allowed to prosecute an appeal
in the federal courts.
The court rejected applicant's argument that Molinaro
only applies to appeals from criminal convictions. The court
noted that "the rule should apply with greater force in civil
cases where an individual's liberty is not at stake," 692 F. 2d,
at 589, and cited a series of cases from the Courts of Appeals
so holding. See Doyle v. Department of Justice, 215 U. S.
App. D. C. 338, 668 F. 2d 1365 (1981) (per curiam), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1002 (1982); Broadway v. City of Montgomery, 530 F. 2d 657 (CA5 1976); United States ex rel. Bailey v.
Commanding Officer, 496 F. 2d 324 (CA1 1974). The court
also said it need not determine whether Molinaro would
apply where the criminal conviction and the civil appeal are
unrelated because here the issues of the two cases "are each
related components of a general tax evasion scheme." 692
F. 2d, at 590. Finally, relying on its own decisions in United
States v. Wood, 550 F. 2d 435 (1976), and Johnson v. Laird,
432 F. 2d 77 (1970), the court held that Molinaro is not limited to discretionary appeals.
The Court of Appeals did not leave applicant without recourse. The court ruled that "[ilf within 56 days he submits
himself to the jurisdiction of the District Court of Nevada
[the court from which he is a fugitive], he may move to reinstate his appeal." 692 F. 2d, at 590. With a three-day extension because of the New Year's Eve holiday, the 56 days
expired on January 3, 1983. On the same day applicant filed

in this Court for a stay of the Court of Appeals' decision pending his filing of a petition for certiorari and our disposition of
that petition.
Applicant argues that a stay should be granted because
"the 56 day limitation will expire before the application for a
writ of certiorari can be completed and filed." He maintains
that should this Court deny his yet-to-be filed petition for
certiorari he desires to have time remaining to comply with
the Court of Appeals' directive. The 56 days expired on the
day applicant filed for this stay. Except in extreme circumstances the Court generally is unable to provide same-day
service. While it might be within our jurisdiction to grant a
stay retroactively, an applicant detracts from the urgency of
his situation where he makes a last-minute claim and offers
no explanation for his procrastination.
Applicant may be injured if a stay does not issue. Assuming he files a petition for certiorari, unless we grant that petition and reverse the lower court the running of the 56 days
will bar applicant from reinstating his appeal by surrendering
to the authorities. A stay is appropriate, however, only
where there is a reasonable possibility that four Justices of
this Court will vote to grant certiorari. See Houchins V.
KQED, Inc., 429 U. S. 1341, 1344 (1977) (REHNQUIST, J., in
chambers); Graves v. Barnes, 405 U. S. 1201, 1203 (1972)
(POWELL, J., in chambers). I do not believe that a reasonable possibility exists here.'
In Molinaro v. New Jersey, supra, the Court said that
while a litigant's status as a fugitive from justice "does not
strip the case of its character as an adjudicable case or controversy, we believe it disentitles the [litigant] to call upon
the resources of the Court for determination of his claims."
While applicant alleges injury in his request for a stay, he does not set
forth a legal argument on the merits. Thus, the application could be denied for applicant's failure to carry his burden of overcoming the presumptive correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision. Whalen v. Roe, 423
U. S. 1313, 1316 (1975) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers).

Id., at 366. See also Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97
(1876). While this Court has never extended the "fugitive
from justice" rule beyond the facts of Molinaro and Smith
(i. e., where the criminal conviction from which the litigant is
a fugitive is the judgment being challenged on appeal), the
court below correctly points out that the Courts of Appeals
have done so on a number of occasions. Since we have denied certiorari in this type case in the past, I do not believe it
likely that applicant's petition will be granted. See, e. g.,
Doyle v. Department of Justice, supra.2
For these reasons the application is denied.

'Applicant's failure to seek a stay in the Court of Appeals provides an
alternative ground for denial of the stay. "An application for a stay or injunction to a Justice of this Court shall not be entertained, except in the
most extraordinary circumstances, unless application for the relief sought
first has been made to the appropriate court or courts below, or to a judge
or judges thereof." This Court's Rule 44.4. Applicant seeks to be excused from his failure to comply with this Rule, not because of any "extraordinary circumstances," but because, according to applicant, the Court
of Appeals "has ruled that [he] has forfeited any right to seek relief from
the judicial processes of" that court. To the contrary, the court found only
that applicant could not pursue his civil appeal unless he turned himself in
within 56 days.
