BONURA v. CBS, INC.
Opinion in Chambers

BONURA ET AL. V. CBS, INC., ET AL.
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY
No. A-622.

Decided January 16, 1983

An application to vacate the Court of Appeals' stay of the District Court's
order forbidding the broadcast by CBS in the Dallas area of a particular
segment of a designated program, is denied.

Justice.
There is no doubt that as Circuit Justice I have the power
to set aside the stay issued by the Court of Appeals in this
case. Only the weightiest considerations, however, would
warrant such action by a Circuit Justice. New York v.
Kleppe, 429 U. S. 1307, 1310 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., in chambers); O'Rourke v. Levine, 80 S. Ct. 623, 624, 4 L. Ed. 2d
615, 616 (1960) (Harlan, J., in chambers).
I have examined the transcript of the hearing held by the
District Judge at 8:30 p. m. on January 15, 1983, in New Orleans, the order issued after the hearing forbidding the
broadcast by CBS in the Dallas area of a particular segment
of a designated program, the order issued by a divided panel
of the Court of Appeals staying the District Court's order,
and the application to me to vacate the stay of the Court of
Appeals. I am not myself convinced that the Court of Appeals was in error in issuing the stay; and I do not think that
if the application were before the full Court, five Justices
would vote to vacate the stay. Accordingly, I deny the
application to vacate the stay.
JUSTICE WHITE, Circuit
