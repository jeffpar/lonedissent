BROWN ET AL. v. SOCIALIST WORKERS '74 CAM-

PAIGN COMMITTEE (OHIO)

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
No. 81-776.

Argued October 4, 1982-Decided December 8, 1982

Held: The disclosure provisions of the Ohio Campaign Expense Reporting
Law requiring every candidate for political office to report the names
and addresses of campaign contributors and recipients of campaign disbursements, cannot be constitutionally applied to appellee Socialist
Workers Party (SWP), a minor political party that historically has been
the object of harassment by Government officials and private parties.
Pp. 91-102.
(a) The First Amendment prohibits a State from compelling disclosures by a minor political party that will subject those persons identified
to the reasonable probability of threats, harassment, or reprisals.
Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 74. Moreover, minor parties must be
allowed sufficient flexibility in the proof of injury. Ibid. These principles for safeguarding the First Amendment interests of minor parties
and their members and supporters apply not only to the compelled disclosure of campaign contributors but also to the compelled disclosure of
recipients of campaign disbursements. Pp. 91-98.
(b) Here, the District Court, in upholding appellees' challenge to the
constitutionality of the Ohio disclosure provisions, properly concluded
that the evidence of private and Government hostility toward the SWP
and its members establishes a reasonable probability that disclosing the
names of contributors and recipients will subject them to threats, harassment, and reprisals. Pp. 98-101.
Affirmed.
MARSHALL, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BURGER,
C. J., and BRENNAN, WHITE, and POWELL, JJ., joined, and in Parts I, III,
and IV of which BLACKMUN, J., joined. BLACKMUN, J., filed an opinion

REHNQUIST and STEVENS, JJ., joined, post, p. 107.
