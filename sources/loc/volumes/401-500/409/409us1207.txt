v. STUDENTS CHALLENGING REGULATORY
AGENCY PROCEDURES (SCRAP) ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-72.

Decided July 19, 1972*

SCRAP, a student environmental association, secured from a threejudge District Court an injunction against the authorization by
the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) of a temporary
2.5% freight surcharge to be imposed across the board by most
of the Nation's railroads. The ground for the injunction was
that by adding the surcharge to the cost of transporting recyclable
goods, fewer such goods would be transported, the need would
be met by increased use of natural resources, and there would
therefore be an adverse impact on the environment; hence the
National Environmental Policy Act required that the ICC prepare
an "impact statement" on the surcharge. The District Court
considered the applications for stay of the injunction pending
appeal but, concluding that danger to the environment outweighed
the loss of income and consequent financial threat to the railroads,
the court denied the application. Held: Since it cannot be said
that the District Court's factual evaluation of the necessity for
a stay constituted an abuse of discretion, the applications for stay
must be denied.

this Court on the merits of the preliminary injunction

The Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U. S. C. § 1 et seq.,
permits increases in railroad freight rates to become
effective without prior approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. A carrier may file a proposed tariff
and, after 30 days unless the Commission shortens the
period, the new rate becomes effective as a carrier-made
rate. 49 U. S. C. § 6 (3). The Commission may, however, choose to suspend the effectiveness of newly filed
rates for as much as seven months, in order to investigate
the lawfulness of the rates. 49 U. S. C. § 15 (7). At the
end of seven months, the carrier-proposed rates go into
effect by operation of law unless the Commission has
completed its investigation and affirmatively disapproved
the new rates. Ibid. Prior decisions of this Court confirm the Commission's broad discretion in the exercise
of its power of suspension; judicial review of suspension action or inaction is most severely limited, if not
foreclosed. Arrow Transportation Co. v. Southern R.
Co., 372 U. S. 658 (1963); Board of Railroad Comm'rs
v. Great Northern R. Co., 281 U. S. 412, 429 (1930).
Against this legal background and prodded by an
increasingly precarious financial condition, the railroads,
on December 13, 1971, asked the Commission for leave
to file on short notice a 2.5% surcharge on nearly

all freight rates. The railroads asked that the surcharge be effective as of January 1, 1972. The surcharge
was conceived as an interim emergency means of increasing railroad revenues by some $246 million per
year, a sum the railroads describe as slightly less than
one-sixth of the increased expenses incurred annually
since the last general ratemaking proceedings. Selective
increases on a more permanent basis would follow.
By order dated December 21, 1971, the Commision
denied the railroads' request to make the 2.5%
surcharge effective as of January 1, 1972. The Commission stated that it was aware of the carriers' need
for additional revenues, but concluded that publication
of the interim surcharge on short notice "would preclude
the public from effective participation" in proceedings
to evaluate the surcharge. 340 I. C. C. 358, 361. The
Commission did, however, rule that the railroads might
refile their proposed surcharge on January 5, 1972, to
be effective no earlier than February 5, 1972.
On January 5, 1972, the railroads filed tariffs to put
the 2.5% surcharge into effect on February 5. SCRAP
and other environmental groups asked the Commission
to suspend the surcharge for the statutory seven-month
period. They opposed the across-the-board surcharge
on the ground that the present railroad rate structure
discourages the movement of "recyclable" 2 goods in
commerce and that every across-the-board increase would
2 At the time of filing these stay applications, there was disagreement between the parties over the meaning of the term "recyclable,"
as it pertains to this lawsuit. The railroads apparently understood
the term "in the sense of processing of goods to obtain either a product of the same kind or a previous state of the product." Supplemental Memo of Applicants, filed July 14, 1972, p. 2. SCRAP's list
of recyclable products, the railroads say, includes products that are
"not recyclable in any sense that the railroads understand that term,
but merely involve the familiar circumstances by which one usable
product is derived from another." Id., at 3. See infra, at 1216.

further increase disincentives to recycling. The environmental groups contended that added disincentives to
recycling would result in the increased degradation of
the natural environment by discarded, unrecycled goods
and in the increased exploitation of scarce natural resources. At a minimum, SCRAP objected to the Commission's failure to issue an "impact statement" evaluating the effect of the 2.5% surcharge on the shipment
and use of recyclable materials. SCRAP contended that
such a statement was required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U. S. C. § 4321
et seq. Section 102 (2) (C) of NEPA, 83 Stat. 853, requires an impact statement "in every recommendation
or report on proposals for legislation and other major
Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the
human environment. . . ." 42 U. S. C. § 4332 (2)(C).1
3 Section 102 of NEPA provides, in pertinent part:
"The Congress authorizes and directs that, to the fullest extent
possible: (1) the policies, regulations, and public laws of the United

States shall be interpreted and administered in accordance with the
policies set forth in this chapter, and (2) all agencies of the Federal
Government shall"(C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals for
legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the

"(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided

"(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,
"(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity, and

"Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible Federal official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal

ABERDEEN & ROCKFISH R. CO. v. SCRAP

Opinion in Chambers

The railroads took the position that interim application of the across-the-board surcharge would not "significantly affect the quality of the human environment"
within the meaning of NEPA. The railroads pointed
out that the 2.5% surcharge would apply equally to
all products; that past experience indicated little likelihood of reduced shipments of recyclable materials as a
result of the across-the-board rate revision; that the
increase was small relative to the normal increase approved in general freight rate revision cases; and that
the increase would be short-lived.
By order dated February 1, 1972, the Commission
announced that it would not suspend the 2.5% surcharge. It would, in effect, allow the surcharge to go
into effect on February 5 and terminate on June 5, 1972.
The order specifically stated the Commission's view that
the surcharge would "have no significant adverse effect
on the movement of traffic by railway or on the quality
of the human environment within the meaning of the
Environmental Policy Act of 1969." The Commission's
order of February 1 further provided that the Commission would not resume the investigation begun by
its December 21 order until the railroads asked to file
the promised selective 4.1% rate increase. After that
tariff was filed, on April 24, the Commission suspended
the 4.1% selective increase for the statutory sevenmonth period until November 30, 1972. Since the
original June 5 expiration date for the surcharge had
assumed that selective increases would become effecagency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect
to any environmental impact involved. Copies of such statement and
the comments and views of the appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental
standards, shall be made available to the President, the Council on
Environmental Quality and to the public as provided by section 552
of Title 5, and shall accompany the proposal through the existing
agency review processes . .. ."

tive by that time, the Commission's order suspending
the 4.1% selective increase eliminated the June 5
surcharge expiration date. The railroads then modified the temporary surcharge tariffs so that the 2.5%
surcharge will expire on November 30, 1972, unless the
4.1% selective increase is approved prior to that
time. The Commission's study of the proposed selective rate increase is still in progress and will include an
environmental impact statement.

SCRAP filed suit on May 12, 1972, in the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking, among other relief requested, a preliminary injunction to require the Commission to prevent the railroads
from further collecting the 2.5% surcharge.4 Other
environmental groups and the railroads were allowed
to intervene as a matter of right. The primary thrust
of SCRAP's suit was that the Commission's orders, permitting and then extending the 2.5% surcharge, constituted "major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment." The plaintiffs
argued that the Commission's action was unlawful because the Commission had not issued an environmental
impact statement as required by NEPA. On July 10,
1972, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the railroads from collecting the 2.5%
surcharge on shipments originating after July 15, 1972,
"insofar as that surcharge relates to goods being transported for purposes of recycling, pending further order
of this court." In its opinion, the District Court rejected the Government's contention that SCRAP and
its fellow plaintiffs lacked standing under this Court's
decision in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 (1972).
A three-judge court was convened to hear the case.

Opinion in Chambers

The court's opinion noted that the SCRAP plaintiffs
had alleged "that its members use the forests, streams,
mountains, and other resources in the Washington [D.C.]
area for camping, hiking, fishing and sightseeing, and
that this use is disturbed by the adverse environmental
impact caused by nonuse of recyclable goods." 346 F.
Supp. 189, 195 (1972). This allegation, said the District Court, removed this case from the ambit of Sierra
Club, "where the Sierra Club failed to allege 'that its
members use Mineral King for any purpose, much less
that they use it in any way that would be significantly
affected by the proposed actions of the respondents.'"
405 U. S., at 735.
Having thus dealt with our decision in Sierra Club,
the District Court focused on Arrow Transportation,
supra, and related cases 5 drastically curtailing the jurisdiction of the federal courts to review the suspension
power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. "The
thrust of the doctrine," reasoned the District Court,
"seems to be that judicial review is available only when
the rates in question are Commission-made rather than
carrier-made." 346 F. Supp., at 196. The District Court
noted that the present case was not one "where the Commission merely stands silently by and allows carrier-made
rates to take effect without suspension." Ibid. The
Commission had found the surcharge rates just and reasonable, and it had authored a detailed set of conditions
on approval of the rates without suspension. The District Court concluded that "[a] suspension decision which

effectively blackmails the carriers into submitting agencyauthored rates is functionally indistinguishable from
an agency order setting those rates ....
[S]uch orders
are, of course, judicially reviewable." Id., at 197.
Yet the District Court found it unnecessary to decide
the degree of Commission involvement in effectuating
the 2.5% surcharge. The court held that "NEPA
implicitly confers authority on the federal courts to enjoin any federal action taken in violation of NEPA's
procedural requirements, even if jurisdiction to review this
action is otherwise lacking." Ibid. The federal courts
would have jurisdiction to review, and to enjoin, "even
a mere failure to suspend rates which are wholly carriermade so long as the review is confined to a determination
as to whether the procedural requisites of NEPA have
been followed." Id., at 197 n. 11. Recognition of this
jurisdiction would not undermine the Arrow decision, because "judicial insistence on compliance with the nondiscretionary procedural requirements of NEPA in no
way interferes with the Commission's substantive discretion," id., at 198, to suspend rates pending investigation and final action.
Turning to the merits, the court held that the Commission's decision not to suspend was a "major federal
action" within the meaning of NEPA. An impact statement would be required whenever an action "arguably
will have an adverse environmental impact." Id., at 201.
(Emphasis in original.) The Commission could not escape preparation of a statement by "so transparent a ruse"
as its "single sentence" affirmation that the 2.5% surcharge would have no significant adverse environmental
effect. This finding is "no more than glorified boilerplate," id., at 201 n. 17, and the Commission has failed
to prove its truth.
Finally, the District Court concluded that the balance
of equities in this case tipped in favor of preliminary

Opinion in Chambers

relief. Any damage to the environment would likely
be irreparable. But "the damage done the railroads by
granting the injunction, while clearly nonfrivolous, is
not overwhelming." Id., at 201-202. Without opinion,
the District Court declined to stay its preliminary injunction pending appeal.

It is likely that the questions to be presented by this
appeal "are of such significance and difficulty that there
is a substantial prospect that they will command four
votes for review" when the full Court reconvenes for
the October 1972 Term. Organized Village of Kake v.
Egan, 80 S. Ct. 33, 35, 4 L. Ed. 2d 34, 37 (1959) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers). The decision below may present a
serious question of standing to sue for the protection
of environmental interests. Sierra Club. v. Morton,
supra. The decision may be read as undermining our
Arrow decision and in that respect may conflict with
the reasoning of the Second Circuit in Port of New
York Authority v. United States, 451 F. 2d 783 (CA2
1971). Most important, the decision may have the practical effect of requiring the Commission to file an impact statement whenever it exercises its statutory suspension powers. This requirement is significant because it would likely apply to each of the cluster of
federal agencies presently exercising suspension powers
comparable to that of the Interstate Commerce
Commission.6

U. S. C. § 15 (7) are 49 U. S. C. §§ 316 (g), 318 (c) (Motor Carrier

For these reasons, I would not be prepared to conclude
that the Court would dispose summarily of the dispute
underlying these stay applications. I must, therefore,
consider whether allowing or staying the preliminary injunction is most likely to insure fair treatment for the
interests of the parties and the public until the full Court
acts. On the allegations of the parties some injury will
occur whichever course is taken. Those opposing the stay
naturally point to the large weight to be given to the
District Court's evaluation or "balancing" of the equities.
The harm to the railroads, and to the overall public
interest in maintaining an efficient transportation network, is immediate and direct. Badly needed revenues
will be lost at once, and there is little likelihood that they
can be recouped. The railroads originally estimated the
loss at $500,000 per month, but they have revised that
estimate upwards by several times since advised by
SCRAP that it attaches an unexpectedly broad interpretation to the District Court's injunction. Unlike the
District Court, I find it difficult to dismiss this certain
loss of at least one and perhaps several millions of dollars simply because it is "not overwhelming" relative
to the total revenues to be derived from the surcharge.
Nor is it sufficient to discount the lost revenues because
they might have to be disgorged if found unreasonable by
the Commission at a later date. The chances of such a
ruling are, again, only speculative. As a general premise
for evaluation, the possibility of rebate suggests equally
that shippers would not regard the surcharge as a significant additional cost.
On the other hand, the District Court was convinced
that harm to the environment might result from allowing
the railroads to collect the 2.5% surcharge on recyclable
goods pending disposition of their appeal in this Court.
The District Court concluded that any such harm would
likely be irreparable, since, as the court explained, "once

ABERDEEN & ROCKFISH R. CO. v. SCRAP

Opinion in Chambers

raw materials are unnecessarily extracted from the ground
and used, they cannot be returned from whence they
came."
346 F. Supp., at 201. This eventuality is
premised on the following projected chain of events:
(a) The railroads will collect the 2.5 percent surcharge on recyclable, as well as all other materials.
(b) Because recyclable materials are already discriminated against in freight rates, the surcharge
further increases rate disparities and, in any event,
raises the absolute cost of transporting recyclable
materials, often a high proportion of their total
cost.
(c) This increase in cost will result in decreased
demand for recyclable materials.
(d) This decrease in demand will be counterbalanced by an increased demand for new or unrecycled materials.
(e) This increased demand for new materials will
result in extraction of natural resources not otherwise
planned.
There is evidence in the record arguably supporting this
forecast of the consequences of increasing freight rates
on recyclable goods in common with others.
Our society and its governmental instrumentalities,
having been less than alert to the needs of our environment for generations, have now taken protective steps.
These developments, however praiseworthy, should not
lead courts to exercise equitable powers loosely or casually
whenever a claim of "environmental damage" is asserted.
7 In

evaluating the possibility of irreparable harm to the environment, the District Court did not mention the danger of increased
disposal of recyclable materials. The District Court had adverted to
this problem earlier in its opinion. Since the lower court did not
premise its action on this possibility, it apparently concluded that any
short-range harm to the environment caused by increased disposal
would not be irreparable.

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

409 U. S.

The world must go on and new environmental legislation
must be carefully meshed with more traditional patterns
of federal regulation. The decisional process for judges
is one of balancing and it is often a most difficult task.
A District Court of three judges has considered this application for a stay pending appeal and has concluded
that the stay should be denied. The criteria for granting a stay of the judgment of such a district court are
stringent, at least when the necessity for a stay turns
upon a refined factual evaluation of its effect. "An order
of a court of three judges denying an interlocutory injunction will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly
the result of an improvident exercise of judicial discretion." United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm'n,
278 U. S. 322, 326 (1929); Railway Express Agency v.
United States, 82 S. Ct. 466, 7 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1962)
(Harlan, J., in chambers). I cannot say the District
Court's action can be equated with an abuse of discretion because it decided that there was danger to the
environment outweighing the loss of income and consequent financial threat to the railroads. Notwithstanding
my doubts of the correctness of the action of the threejudge District Court, as Circuit Justice, acting alone, I
incline toward deferring to their collective evaluation and
balancing of the equities.
Reluctantly, I conclude that the applications for stay
pending appeal should be denied.
