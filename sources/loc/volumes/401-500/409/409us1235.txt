COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIANA v. WHITCOMB

1235

Opinion in Chambers

COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIANA ET AL. V. WHITCOMB, GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-378.

Decided October 6, 1972

Motion denominated an application for stay but intended to secure a
partial summary reversal of the District Court's order denied,
since the applicants' right to such relief is not indisputably clear.

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.

Applicants have filed a motion denominated an "Application for Stay of Order of United States District
Court of the Northern District of Indiana, Hammond
Division," which order was entered following a hearing
on their complaint alleging that the oath required by
Indiana law in order for a party to be placed on the ballot
was unconstitutional. An examination of the application, however, shows that applicants do not seek a stay
of that order, but instead a partial summary reversal of
the District Court order entered on October 4, 1972.
While a Circuit Justice of this Court apparently has
authority under Supreme Court Rule 51 to grant such
relief in the form of a mandatory injunction, usage and
practice suggest that this extraordinary remedy be employed only in the most unusual case. In order that it
be available, the applicants' right to relief must be indisputably clear. Applicants do not present such a case,
and their application is therefore denied.
