OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Per Curiam

409 U. S.

DILLARD v. INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION OF
VIRGINIA ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA

No. 72-5411.

Decided December 11, 1972

347 F. Supp. 71, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Appellant brought a class action to challenge the constitutionality of a state regulation that permitted temporary suspension of his workmen's compensation payments without a prior hearing. He appealed an adverse judgment, but his jurisdictional statement states
that after the decision below "an Order was entered by
the Commission approving a lump-sum settlement of
$4,243.20 in full settlement of [his] individual claim for
compensation for his injury which occurred on March 15,
1971."
In this state of the record, the motion to proceed in
forma pauperis is granted, the judgment is vacated, and
the case is remanded to the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia to consider whether
this case is moot.
