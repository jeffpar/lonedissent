Syllabus

CITY OF PITTSBURGH v. ALCO PARKING
CORP. ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PENNSYLVANIA

No. 73-582.

Argued April 15, 1974-Decided June 10, 1974

Respondent operators of offstreet parking facilities in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
sued to enjoin the enforcement of a city ordinance imposing an
increased 20% tax on the gross receipts from parking or storing
automobiles at nonresidential parking places, alleging, inter alia,
that the ordinance was invalid under the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The lower courts sustained the
ordinance, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court invalidated it on
the ground that the tax was so unreasonably high and burdensome
that, in the context of competition from public lots operated by the
city parking authority, which enjoyed certain tax exemptions and
other advantages, the ordinance had the "effect" of an uncompensated taking of property contrary to the Due Process Clause.
Held: The ordinance is not unconstitutional, and the city was constitutionally entitled to put the automobile parker to the choice of
using other transportation or paying the increased tax. Pp. 373379.
(a) The fact that a tax is so excessive as to render a business
unprofitable or even threaten its existence furnishes no ground for
holding the tax unconstitutional, Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292
U. S. 40; Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S. 44, and the judiciary
should not infer from such fact, alone, a legislative attempt to
exercise a forbidden power in the form of a seeming tax. Pp.
373-376.
(b) The ordinance does not lose its character as a tax or revenueraising measure and may not be invalidated as too burdensome
under the Due Process Clause merely because the taxing authority,
directly or through an instrumentality enjoying various forms of
tax exemption, competes with the taxpayer in a manner that the
judiciary thinks is unfair, since the Due Process Clause does not
demand of or permit the judiciary to undertake to separate burdensome and nonburdensome taxes or to oversee the terms and circumstances under which the government or its tax-exempt instrumentalities may compete with the private sector. Pp. 376-377.
453 Pa. 245, 307 A. 2d 851, reversed.

MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the

Court.
The issue in this case is the validity under the Federal
Constitution of Ordinance No. 704, which was enacted by
the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, City Council in December 1969, and which placed a 20% tax on the gross receipts
obtained from all transactions involving the parking or
storing of a motor vehicle at a nonresidential parking
place in return for a consideration.1 The ordinance
*James S. Hostetler filed a brief for the Council for Private Enterprise et al. as amici curiae.
1 The ordinance defined a nonresidential parking place as follows:
"(c) 'Non-Residential Parking Place' or 'Parking Place'--any place
within the City, whether wholly or partially enclosed or open, at
which motor vehicles are parked or stored for any period of time in
return for a consideration not including:
"(i) any parking area or garage to the extent that it is provided
or leased to the occupants of a residence on the same or other premises for use only in connection with, and as accessory to, the

occupancy of such residence, and (ii) any parking area or garage
operated exclusively by an owner or lessee of a hotel, an apartment
hotel, tourist court or trailer park, to the extent that the parking
area or garage is provided to guests or tenants of such hotel, tourist
court or trailer park for no additional consideration.
"As used herein, the term 'residence' includes (i) any building
designed and used for family living or sleeping purposes other than
a hotel, apartment hotel, tourist court or trailer park, and (ii) any
dwelling unit located in a hotel or apartment hotel.

Opinion of the Court

superseded a 1968 ordinance imposing an identical tax,
but at the rate of 15%, which in turn followed a tax at
the rate of 10% imposed by the city in 1962. Soon after
its enactment, 12 operators of offstreet parking facilities located in the city sued to enjoin enforcement of
the ordinance, alleging that it was invalid under the Equal
Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment, as well as Art. VIII, ยง 1, of the Pennsylvania
Constitution, which requires that taxes shall be uniform
upon the same class of subjects. It appears from the
findings and the opinions in the state courts that, at the
time of suit, there were approximately 24,300 parking
spaces in the downtown area of the city, approximately
17,000 of which the respondents operated. Another
1,000 were in the hands of private operators not party
to the suit. The balance of approximately 6,100 was
owned by the Parking Authority of the city of Pittsburgh, an agency created pursuant to the Parking Authority Law of June 5, 1947, Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 53, ยง 341 et
seq. (1974). The trial court also found that there was
then a deficiency of 4,100 spaces in the downtown area.
The Court of Common Pleas sustained the ordinance. Its judgment was affirmed by the Commonwealth Court by a four-to-three vote, 6 Pa. Commw.
433, 291 A. 2d 556 (1972), on rehearing, 6 Pa. Commw.
453, 295 A. 2d 349 (1972); but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court reversed, also four to three. 453 Pa.
245, 307 A. 2d 851 (1973). That court rejected challenges to the ordinance under the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause, but invalidated
the ordinance as an uncompensated taking of property
contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Because the decision appeared to be in
park' and 'dwelling unit' are used herein as defined in the Zoning
Ordinance, Ordinance No. 192, approved May 10, 1958, as amended."

conflict with the applicable decisions of this Court, we
granted certiorari, 414 U. S. 1127 (1974), and we now reverse the judgment.2
In the opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania,
two aspects of the Pittsburgh ordinance combined to
deprive the respondents of due process of law. First, the
court thought the tax was "unreasonably high" and was
responsible for the inability of nine of 14 different private
parking lot operators to conduct their business at a profit
and of the remainder to show more than marginal earnings. 453 Pa., at 259-260, 307 A. 2d, at 859-860. Second, private operators of parking lots faced competition
from the Parking Authority, a public agency enjoying
tax exemption (although not necessarily from this tax) '
2 It
appears from the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
that Ordinance No. 704 was itself superseded while appeal was pending in the state courts. 453 Pa. 245,266 n. 13,307 A. 2d 851,863 n. 13.
The new urdinance, effective April 1, 1973, imposed a 20% tax on
the consideration paid in nonresidential parking transactions, the
tax to be collected from the patron by the operator. This case is
not mooted by the new ordinance, however, for there remains the
issue of substantial refunds of taxes collected under Ordinance
No. 704.
3 The ordinance on its face applies to all nonresidential parking
transactions. The following, however, appears in n. 9 of the opinion
of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, 453 Pa., at 265, 307 A. 2d, at
862:
"As of this writing, the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas
has ruled that the Public Parking Authority is exempt from payment of the challenged gross receipts tax. Public Parking Authority
of Pittsburgh v. City of Pittsburgh, No. 687, July Term, 1972. See
Allegheny County v. Moon Township, 436 Pa. 54, 258 A. 2d 630
(1969). An appeal is presently pending before the Commonwealth
Court.
"However, whether the Public Parking Authority is subject to the
tax seems to make little real difference in the context of this present
dispute. Even if the Authority had to pay the tax to the City it
would mean only in reality an accounting transaction, transferring

Opinion of the Court

and other advantages which enabled it to offer offstreet
parking at lower rates than those charged by private
operators. The average all-day rate for the public lots
was $2 as compared with a $3 all-day rate for the
private lots. Ibid. The court's conclusion was that
"[w]here such an unfair competitive advantage accrues,
generated by the use of public funds, to a local government at the expense of private property owners, without
just compensation, a clear constitutional violation has
occurred.. . ." "[T]he unreasonably burdensome 20 percent gross receipts tax, causing the majority of private
parking lot operators to operate their businesses at a loss,
in the special competitive circumstances of this case, constitutes an unconstitutional taking of private property
without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the United States Constitution." Id., at
267, 269-270, 307 A. 2d, at 863, 864.
We cannot agree that these two considerations, either
alone or together, are sufficient to invalidate the parking
tax ordinance involved in this case. The claim that a
particular tax is so unreasonably high and unduly burdensome as to deny due process is both familiar and recurring, but the Court has consistently refused either to
undertake the task of passing on the "reasonableness" of
a tax that otherwise is within the power of Congress or of
state legislative authorities, or to hold that a tax is unconstitutional because it renders a business unprofitable.
In Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 (1934), the
Court sustained against due process attack a state excise
tax of 150 per pound on all butter substitutes sold in the
dollars from one pocket of an instrumentality of City government to

another. Thus although appellants' argument would be strengthened
by the common pleas court's decision, we need not presently rest our
decision upon Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh v. City of
Pittsburgh, supra."

State. Conceding that We "tax is so excessive that it
may or will result in destroying the intrastate business of
appellant," id., at 45, the Court held that "the due process
of law clause contained in the Fifth Amendment is not a
limitation upon the taxing power conferred upon Congress," that no different rule should be applied to the
States and that a tax within the lawful power of a State
should not "be judicially stricken down under the due
process clause simply because its enforcement may or will
result in restricting or even destroying particular occupations or businesses." Id., at 44. The premise that a tax
is invalid if so excessive as to bring about the destruction
of a particular business, the Court said, had been "uniformly rejected as furnishing no juridical ground for striking down a taxing act." Id., at 47. Veazie Bank v. Fenno,
8 Wall. 533, 548 (1869); McCray v. United States, 195
U. S. 27 (1904); and Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S.
44 (1921), are to the same effect.
In Alaska Fish, a tax on the manufacture of certain
fish products was sustained, the Court saying, id.,
at 48-49: "Even if the tax should destroy a business it
would not be made invalid or require compensation upon
that ground alone. Those who enter upon a business
We know of no objection to exacting
take that risk ....
a discouraging rate as the alternative to giving up a
business, when the legislature has the full power of taxation." See also InternationalHarvester Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Taxation, 322 U. S. 435, 444 (1944);
Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S. 20, 30 (1922);
Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 24 (1916);
Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 168-169 (1911).
Neither the parties nor the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court purports to differ with the foregoing principles.
But the state court concluded that this was one of those
"rare and special instances" recognized in Magnano and

PITTSBURGH v. ALCO PARKING CORP.
369

Opinion of the Court

other cases where the Due Process Clause may be invoked
because the taxing statute is "so arbitrary as to compel
the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of
the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and
effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden
power, as, for example, the confiscation of property."
292 U. S., at 44.4
There are several difficulties with this position. The
ordinance on its face recites that its purpose is "[t] o provide for the general revenue by imposing a tax .
and in sustaining the ordinance against an equal protection challenge, the state court itself recognized that
commercial parking lots are a proper subject for special
taxation and that the city had decided, "not without
reason, that commercial parking operations should be
singled out for special taxation to raise revenue because
of traffic related problems engendered by these operations." 453 Pa., at 257, 307 A. 2d, at 858 (emphasis
added).
It would have been difficult from any standpoint to
have held that the ordinance was in no sense a revenue
measure. The 20% tax concededly raised substantial
sums of money; and even if the revenue collected had
been insubstantial, Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S.
506, 513-514 (1937), or the revenue purpose only secondary, Hampton & Co. v. United States, 276 U. S. 394,
411-413 (1928), we would not necessarily treat this exaction as anything but a tax entitled to the presumption
of the validity accorded other taxes imposed by a State.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

417 U. S.

Rather than conclude that the 20% levy was not a tax
at all, the Pennsylvania court accepted it as such and
merely concluded that it was so unreasonably high and
burdensome that, in the context of competition by the
city, the ordinance had the "effect" of an uncompensated
taking of property. 453 Pa., at 269, 307 A. 2d, at 864.
The court did not hold a parking tax, as such, to be
beyond the power of the city but it appeared to hold
that a bona fide tax, if sufficiently burdensome, could be
held invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. This
approach is contrary to the cases already cited, particularly to the oft-repeated principle that the judiciary
should not infer a legislative attempt to exercise a forbidden power in the form of a seeming tax from the fact,
alone, that the tax appears excessive or even so high as
to threaten the existence of an occupation or business.
Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, at 47; Child Labor
Tax Case, supra, at 40-41; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, supra,
at 548.
Nor are we convinced that the ordinance loses its
character as a tax and may be stricken down as too
burdensome under the Due Process Clause if the taxing
authority, directly or through an instrumentality enjoying various forms of tax exemption, competes with the
taxpayer in a manner thought to be unfair by the judiciary. This approach would demand not only that the
judiciary undertake to separate those taxes that are too
burdensome from those that are not, but also would
require judicial oversight of the terms and circumstances
under which the government or its tax-exempt instrumentalities may undertake to compete with the private
sector. The clear teaching of prior cases is that this is
not a task that the Due Process Clause demands of or
permits to the judiciary. We are not now inclined to
chart a different course.

PITTSBURGH v. ALCO PARKING CORP.
369

Opinion of the Court

In Veazie Bank, supra, a 10% tax on state bank notes
was sustained over the objection of the dissenters that
the purpose was to foster national banks, instrumentalities of the National Government, in preference to private
banks chartered by the States. More directly in point
is Puget Sound Co. v. Seattle, 291 U. S. 619 (1934),
where the city imposed a gross receipts tax on a power and
light company and at the same time actively competed
with that company in the business of furnishing power
to consumers. The company's contention was that
"constitutional limitations are transgressed . . . because
the tax affects a business with which the taxing sovereign
is actively competing." Id., at 623. Calling on prior
cases in support, the Court rejected the contention, holding that "the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent
a city from conducting a public water works in competition with private business or preclude taxation of the
private business to help its rival to succeed." Id., at
626. See also Madera Water Works v. Madera,228 U. S.
454 (1913). The holding in Puget Sound remains good
law and, together with the other authorities to which we
have already referred, it is sufficient to require reversal
of the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
Even assuming that an uncompensated and hence forbidden "taking" could be inferred from an unreasonably
high tax in the context of competition from the taxing
authority, we could not conclude that the Due Process
Clause was violated in the circumstances of this case. It
was urged by the city that the private operators would
not suffer because they could and would pass the tax on
to their customers, who, as a class, should pay more for
the services of the city that they directly or indirectly
utilize in connection with the special problems incident
to the twice daily movement of large numbers of cars on
the streets of the city and in and out of parking garages.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

417 U. S.

The response of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was
that competition from the city prevented the private
operators from raising their prices and recouping
their losses by collecting the tax from their customers.
On the record before us, this is not a convincing basis
for concluding that the parking tax effected an unconstitutional taking of respondents' property. There are
undisturbed findings in the record that there were 24,300
parking places in the downtown area, that there was an
overall shortage of parking facilities, and that the public
authority supplied only 6,100 parking spaces. Because
these latter spaces were priced substantially under the
private lots it could be anticipated that they would be
preferred by those seeking parking in the downtown area.
Insofar as this record reveals, for the 20% tax to have a
destructive effect on private operators as compared with
the situation immediately preceding its enactment, the
damage would have to flow chiefly, not from those who
preferred the cheaper public parking lots, but from those
who could no longer afford an increased price for downtown parking at all. If this is the case, we simply have
another instance where the government enacts a tax at
a "discouraging rate as the alternative to giving up a
business," a policy to which there is no constitutional
objection. Alaska Fish Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S., at 49;
Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S., at 46.
The parking tax ordinance recited that "[n]on-residential parking places for motor vehicles, by reason of the
frequency rate of their use, the changing intensity of their
use at various hours of the day, their location, their
relationship to traffic congestion and other characteristics,
present problems requiring municipal services and affect
the public interest, differently from parking places accessory to the use and occupancy of residences." By enacting the tax, the city insisted that those providing and

J., concurring

utilizing nonresidential parking facilities should pay more
taxes to compensate the city for the problems incident to
offstreet parking. The city was constitutionally entitled to put the automobile parker to the choice of using
other transportation or paying the increased tax.
The judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL,

concurring.

The opinion of the Court fully explicates the issue presented here, and I am in accord with its resolution. I
write briefly only to emphasize my understanding that
today's decision does not foreclose the possibility that
some combination of unreasonably burdensome taxation
and direct competition by the taxing authority might
amount to a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments.
To some extent, private business is inevitably handicapped by direct governmental competition, but the
opinion of the Court makes plain that the legitimate
exercise of the taxing power is not to be restrained on
this account. It is conceivable, however, that punitive
taxation of a private industry and direct economic competition through a governmental entity enjoying special
competitive advantages would effectively expropriate a
private business for public profit. Such a combination
of unreasonably burdensome taxation and public competition would be the functional equivalent of a governmental taking of private property for public use and
would be subject to the constitutional requirement of
just compensation. As the opinion of the Court clearly
reveals, ante, at 377-378, no such circumstance has been
shown to exist in the instant case.
