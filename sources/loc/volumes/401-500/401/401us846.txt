granted.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration
or decision of this case.
MR.JUSTICE STEWART,
LAS joins, dissenting.

with -whom MR,JUSTICE Doua;

In the petitioner's trial on a charge of rape, the District Judge instructed the jury that it could return a
.yerdict-of guilty with the death penalty. Yet that verdict was constitutionally impermissible in light of this
Court's decision in United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S.
570. See Bailey v. United States, 132 U. S. App. D. C..
82, 86 and n. 3, 405 F. 2d 1352, 1356 and n. 3. I think
the extreme prejudice arising from this erroneous instruction requires reversal of the judgment of conviction and
a remand of this case for a new trial. Cf. Price v. G7eorgia, 398 U. S. 323, 331-332.
