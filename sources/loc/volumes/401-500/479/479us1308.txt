OCTOBER TERM, 1986
Opinion in Chambers

479 U. S.

KLEEM, ET AL. v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE
ON APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME WITHIN WHICH TO
FILE A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI
No. A-416.

Decided December 4, 1986

An application, authorized by 28 U. S. C. ยง 2101(c), for a 60-day extension
of time in which to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Court of
Appeals is denied. Applicants' counsel has not met ยง 2101(c)'s standard
of "good cause shown" by simply asserting his desire for additional time
to research constitutional issues.
JUSTICE SCALIA,

Circuit Justice.

Counsel for applicants has asked for a 60-day extension of
time in which to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The stated reason
for the request is that the case presents "important questions
under the Constitution of the United States which were determined adversely to the petitioner by the court below," and
counsel desires "additional time to research and prepare the
Writ of Certiorari."
Writs of certiorari in civil cases "shall be ...

applied for

within ninety days" after entry of the subject judgment, 28
U. S. C. ยง2101(c), which period may be extended by a Justice of this Court (up to an additional 60 days) "for good cause
shown," ibid. Under this Court's Rule 20.6, requests for
extensions of time "are not favored." In this case, counsel
has given no reason for his request other than his desire for
additional time to research constitutional issues. The same
reason could be adduced in virtually all cases. It does not
meet the standard of "good cause shown" for the granting of a
disfavored extension. Pursuant to the Rules of this Court,
the application for extension is
Denied.
