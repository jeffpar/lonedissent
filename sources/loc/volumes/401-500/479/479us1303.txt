KENTUCKY v. STINCER
Opinion in Chambers

KENTUCKY v. STINCER
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-274 (86-572).

Decided October 15, 1986

An application by the Commonwealth of Kentucky to stay the Kentucky
Supreme Court's judgment -holding that the Confrontation Clause of
the Sixth Amendment gives an accused child molester the right to be
present at the hearing inquiring into the victim's competency to testifyis denied. After this case was decided, the Kentucky Legislature enacted a statute providing procedures for securing the testimony of young
victims of sexual abuse, and the Kentucky Supreme Court has upheld
the validity of the statute, even though it does not require the accused's
presence at the competency hearing. Under the circumstances, there is
no reasonable probability that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari.
JUSTICE SCALIA,

Circuit Justice.

I doubt the conclusion of the Kentucky Supreme Court that
the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment gives an
accused child molester the right to be present at the hearing
inquiring into the competency of his child victim to testify. I
see, moreover, at least a "fair prospect" that a majority of
this Court would find that conclusion erroneous. See Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980) (BRENNAN, J.,
in chambers). However, approximately one month after
this case was decided the Kentucky Legislature enacted a
statute providing specific procedures for securing the testimony of young victims of sexual abuse. See Ky. Rev. Stat.
ยง 421.350 (Supp. 1986). The Supreme Court of Kentucky has
upheld the validity of that statute, even though it does
not require presence of the accused at the competency hearing. See Commonwealth v. Willis, 716 S. W. 2d 224 (1986).
Since, therefore, it is unlikely that the issue presented by
this case will arise again in Kentucky, and since I am
unaware of any other State which has resolved the issue as
did the Kentucky Supreme Court, see, e. g., State v. Taylor,
103 N. M. 189, 195, 704 P. 2d 443, 449 (App. 1985); Moll v.
State, 351 N. W. 2d 639, 644 (Minn. App. 1984); People v.

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
Opinion in Chambers

479 U. S.

Breitweiser, 38 Ill. App. 3d 1066, 1067-1068, 349 N. E. 2d

P. 2d 558, 561 (1971), I cannot discern "a 'reasonable probability' that four Justices will ... [vote] to grant certiorari
.... " Rostker v. Goldberg, supra, at 1308 (citations omitted). The application for stay of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is accordingly
Denied.
