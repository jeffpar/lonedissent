REPORTER'S NOTE

The next page is purposely numbered 1301. The numbers between 1104
and 1301 were intentionally omitted, in order to make it possible to publish
in-chambers opinions with permanent page numbers, thus making the
official citations available upon publication of the preliminary prints of
the United States Reports.
