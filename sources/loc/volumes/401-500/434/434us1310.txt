BEAME, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, ET AL. V
FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-99 (76-1718).

Decided August 5, 1977

Application by New York City and city officials for stay, pending this
Court's determination of their petition for certiorari, of enforcement of
the Court of Appeals' judgment directing the District Court to take
steps to ensure that the Transportation Control Plan for the Metropolitan New York Area under the Clean Air Act "will be promptly
implemented," is denied, where it does not appear either that there is a
balance of irreparable harm in applicants' favor or that four Members
of this Court will vote to grant certiorari.
See: 552 F 2d 25.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, Circuit Justice.

Applicants, the city of New York (City) and several of its
officials, seek a stay of enforcement of a judgment of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit pending
determination by this Court of their petition for certiorari.
In its judgment, entered January 18, 1977, the Court of
Appeals directed the District Court to take steps to ensure
that the Transportation Control Plan for the Metropolitan
New York Area (Plan) "will be promptly implemented."
Friends of the Earth v Carey, 552 F 2d 25, 39. Pursuant to
this judgment, the District Court in February ordered applicants to begin implementation of four pollution control strategies, involving reductions in business district parking, taxicab
cruising, and daytime freight movements, and the imposition
of tolls on certain bridges into Manhattan. Applicants moved
for a stay of this directive in the District Court and the Court
of Appeals, both motions were denied. Applicants then
sought a stay from me, and oral argument was heard in chambers. For the reasons that follow, I must deny the application for a stay

I
This case is the most recent skirmish in a long legal battle.
In April 1973, the State of New York (State) submitted to
the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the Plan here at issue, pursuant
to § 110 (a) (1) of the Clean Air Act (Act), added by the
Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 1680, 42 U S. C.
§ 1857c-5 (a) (1). The Administrator approved the Plan,
and his approval was then challenged in court. The Second
Circuit upheld the validity of the Plan in all material respects in Friends of the Earth v EPA, 499 F 2d 1118 (1974)
(Friends I).
Soon after the Friends I decision, respondents filed the
instant action, a citizen suit brought pursuant to § 304 of the
Act, 84 Stat. 1706, 42 U S. C. § 1857h-2. They sought to
compel applicants to implement the four pollution control
strategies referred to above. The District Court denied this
request for enforcement of the Plan, and the Court of Appeals
reversed, Friends of the Earth v Carey, 535 F 2d 165 (1976)
(Friends 11) The District Court then entered partial summary judgment for respondents in April 1976, but in July it
significantly modified its judgment, ruling that the City did
not have to enforce the Plan against any polluter other than
itself. This holding was purportedly based on the Tenth
Amendment as interpreted by this Court m National League
of Cities v Usery, 426 U S. 833 (1976), and by lower courts in
the cases consolidated in EPA v Brown, 431 U S. 99 (1977)
(per curiam).
In January 1977, the Court of Appeals again reversed,
Friends of the Earth v Carey, 552 F 2d 25 (Friends III),
giving two alternative rationales for its holding that the
April 1976 partial summary judgment should be reinstated.
First, the court reasoned that applicants were precluded by
§ 307 (b) (2) of the Act, 84 Stat. 1708, 42 U S. C. § 1857h-5
(b) (2), from making their constitutional attack on the Plan

as a defense to a civil enforcement proceeding. Such an
attack could only have been made, the court stated, in a
petition for review of the EPA Administrator's approval of the
Plan in 1973-a time when the City was supporting the Plan.
Second, even assuming no statutory preclusion, the court held
that the District Court's Tenth Amendment analysis was in
error, because the State here promulgated its own Plan, which
thus represented its own policy choices. In the cases involved
in EPA v Brown, supra, by contrast, the EPA had promulgated plans for the States, pursuant to its mandate to do so
whenever a State fails to submit a plan or submits an inadequate plan, see § 110 (c) (1) of the Act, 42 U S. C § 1857c-5
(c) (1) The Court of Appeals concluded that the federal
intrusion into state affairs is much more limited in a case in
which the Federal Government sets only goals and the State
decides for itself how to reach them. Applicants' certiorari
petition seeks review in this Court of both grounds for the
Court of Appeals' holding.
II
In deciding whether to grant a stay pending disposition of
a petition for certiorari, the Members of this Court use two
principal criteria. First, "a Circuit Justice should 'balance
the equities'
and determine on which side the risk of
irreparable injury weighs most heavily" Holtzman v Schles2nger, 414 U S. 1304, 1308-1309 (1973) (MARSHALL, J.,
in chambers) Second, assuming a balance of equities in
favor of the applicant, the Circuit Justice must also determine
whether "it is likely that four Members of this Court would
vote to grant a writ of certiorari." Id., at 1310. The burden
of persuasion as to both of these issues rests on the applicant,
and his burden is particularly heavy when, as here, a stay has
been denied by the District Court and by a unanimous panel
of the Court of Appeals. See Magnum Import Ca. v Coty,
262 U S. 159, 163-164 (1923), Board of Educatzon v Taylor,
82 S. Ct. 10, 10-11 (1961) (BRENNAN, J., in chambers), cf.

1313

Opinion in Chambers

Holtzman v Schlesnnger, supra, at 1314-1315 ("great weight"
given to decision by Court of Appeals to grant stay)
Applicants have not met their burden of showing a balance
of hardships in their favor. Were the injury to the City from
implementation of the Plan as severe as applicants now claim,
one would think that they would have filed their petition for
certiorari with dispatch, so that this matter could have been
resolved by the entire Court prior to the June 29, 1977,
conclusion of the 1976 Term. Instead, applicants waited
the maximum time, 90 days, after the Court of Appeals denied
rehearing and rehearing en bane before filing their petition on
June 2, 1977 In the interim, they did not seek any stay of
the Court of Appeals' judgment and the ensuing District
Court order; they first sought such a stay in the District
Court a full 20 days after filing their certiorari petition.
The applicants' delay in filing their petition and seeking a
stay vitiates much of the force of their allegations of irreparable harm.
The allegations themselves are not compelling. The affidavits of City and Chamber of Commerce officials are offered
to indicate some adverse economic impact on the City from
implementation of the entire Plan. The Plan, however, is to
be phased in over several months, and the affidavits and
accompanying submissions contain little, if any, specific information as to the harm to be expected over the two months
remaining until the entire Court can act on applicants'
petition.
Respondents contend, moreover, that there will be some
economic benefits from implementation of the Plan (e. g.,
faster delivery times for trucks that currently have to maneuver around illegally parked cars, enhanced attractiveness of
the City to businesses and tourists who currently avoid it
because of its traffic, air pollution, and noise) Thus the
economic-impact factor does not weigh entirely in applicants'
favor. In addition, any adverse economic effect of the Plan's

1314

partial implementation over the next two months is balanced
to some considerable extent by the irreparable injury that air
pollution may cause during that period, particularly for those
with respiratory ailments. See Friends II, 535 F 2d, at 179180 (noting that Congress made the decision to put "the
lungs and health of the community's citizens" ahead of some
"inconvenience and expense to
governmental and private
parties" and that the City's carbon monoxide levels are "over
five times the federal health standards")
Finally, if specific
aspects of the Plan prove to be onerous or unworkable, applicants are free at any time to seek an accommodation with
EPA and a modification of the District Court's order.
III
I have therefore concluded that the "balance of equities"
does not weigh in applicants' favor. Even if it did, however,
I am not persuaded that four Justices of this Court would vote
to grant a writ of certiorari in this matter. The Court of
Appeals gave alternative rationales for its result, and its
opinion as to each appears facially correct. Applicants are
thus not "likely to prevail on the merits," Holtzman v
Schlesnnger, supra, at 1311, see Times-Picayune Publishing
Corp. v Schulingkamp, 419 U S. 1301, 1305 (1974) (PowF.L,
J., in chambers) (requiring "significant possibility of reversal"
in order to grant stay)
Judicial considration of applicants' constitutional claam
appears precluded at this point by the language of § 307
(b) (2) of the Act, 42 U S. C § 1857h-5 (b) (2) While this
Court has granted certiorari in Adamo Wrecking Co. v United
States, 430 U S. 953 (1977), in part to consider the validity of
§ 307 (b) (2)'s preclusion of defenses in a criminal context,
applicants do not argue that any analogous considerations
would make § 307 (b) (2) invalid as applied in this civil case.
Applicants' Tenth Amendment contentions are based on
alleged similarities between this case and EPA v Brown, supra,

BEAME v. FRIENDS OF THE EARTH
1310

1315

Opinion in Chambers

but the fact that New York promulgated its own Plan makes
this case significantly different from Brown and, in my view,
renders insubstantial the Tenth Amendment issue here.
Finding neither a balance of irreparable harm in favor of
applicants nor a likelihood that four Justices will vote to
grant a writ of certiorari, I am compelled to deny the application for a stay
