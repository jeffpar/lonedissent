489 U. S.

McDONALD

ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 88-5890.

Decided February 21, 1989

Pro se petitioner filed a motion for leave to proceed informa pauperis on
his petition before this Court for a writ of habeas corpus. Since 1971, he
has made 73 other filings with this Court-including 19 for extraordinary
relief-all of which have been denied without recorded dissent.
Held: Petitioner's motion for leave to proceed informa pauperisis denied,
and the Clerk is directed not to accept any further petitions from him for
extraordinary writs unless he pays the docketing fee required by this
Court's Rule 45(a) and submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33.
The continual processing of his frivolous requests for extraordinary writs
does not permit the Court to allocate its limited resources in a way that
promotes the interests of justice. Paupers filing pro se petitions are not
subject to the financial considerations that deter other litigants from filing frivolous petitions, and lower courts have issued orders intended to
curb serious abuses by persons proceeding in forma pauperis. Petitioner remains free to file informa pauperisrequests for other relief, if
he qualifies and does not similarly abuse that privilege.
Motion denied.
PER CURIAM.

Pro se petitioner Jessie McDonald requests that this Court
issue a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2241(a).
He also requests that he be permitted to proceed in forma
pauperis under this Court's Rule 46. We deny petitioner
leave to proceed in forma pauperis. He is allowed until
March 14, 1989, within which to pay the docketing fee required by Rule 45(a) and to submit a petition in compliance
with this Court's Rule 33. We also direct the Clerk not to
accept any further petitions from petitioner for extraordinary
writs pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §§ 1651(a), 2241, and 2254(a),
unless he pays the docketing fee required by Rule 45(a) and
submits his petition in compliance with Rule 33. We explain
below our reasons for taking this step.
Petitioner is no stranger to us. Since 1971, he has made
73 separate filings with the Court, not including this petition,

Without recorded
dissent, the Court has denied all of his appeals and denied all
of his various petitions and motions. We have never previously denied him leave to proceed in forma pauperis.6

The instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus arises from
petitioner's 1974 state conviction for obtaining title to a 1972
Ford LTD automobile under false pretenses, for which he
was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Petitioner appealed to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, which
reversed his conviction on the ground that there was no eviMcDonald, 479 U. S. 809 (1986) (habeas corpus); In re McDonald, 470

dence that the alleged victim relied on petitioner's false statements. In January 1976, the Supreme Court of Tennessee
reinstated his conviction. State v. McDonald, 534 S.W. 2d
650. We denied certiorari, 425 U. S.955, and rehearing, 425
U. S. 1000 (1976).
In the 13 years since his conviction became final, petitioner
has filed numerous petitions and motions for relief in this
Court and in the Tennessee courts, all of which have been rejected. In the instant petition, for example, he requests
that the Court "set aside" his conviction and direct the State
to "expunge" the conviction "from all public records." He is
not presently incarcerated. He contends that his constitutional rights were violated by the State's failure to prove that
the property to which he obtained title under false pretenses
was valued at over $100, as required by the statute under
which he was convicted. Petitioner has put forward this
same argument -unsuccessfully-in at least four prior filings
with the Court, including a petition for mandamus, which
was filed 13 days before the instant petition and was not disposed of by the Court until more than a month after this petition was filed.'
Title 28 U. S. C. § 1915 provides that "[a]ny court of the
United States may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs
or security therefor."
(Emphasis added.) As permitted
under this statute, we have adopted Rule 46.1, which provides that "[a] party desiring to proceed in this Court in
forma pauperisshall file a motion for leave to so proceed, together with his affidavit in the form prescribed in Fed. Rules

showing that he comes within the statutory requirements."
Each year, we permit the vast majority of persons who wish
to proceed informapauperisto do so; last Term, we afforded
the privilege of proceeding informa pauperisto about 2,300
persons. Paupers have been an important-and valuedpart of the Court's docket, see, e. g., Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U. S. 335 (1963), and remain so.
But paupers filing pro se petitions are not subject to the
financial considerations -filing fees and attorney's fees -that
deter other litigants from filing frivolous petitions. Every
paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's
limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to
see that these resources are allocated in a way that promotes
the interests of justice. The continual processing of petitioner's frivolous requests for extraordinary writs does not
promote that end. Although we have not done so previously, lower courts have issued orders intended to curb serious abuses by persons proceeding in forma pauperis.i Our
order here prevents petitioner from proceeding in forma
pauperis when seeking extraordinary writs from the Court.'
It is perhaps worth noting that we have not granted the sort
of extraordinary writ relentlessly sought by petitioner to any
litigant-paid or in forma pauperis-for at least a decade.
'See, e. g., Procup v. Strickland, 792 F. 2d 1069 (CAll 1986); Peck v.
Hoff, 660 F. 2d 371 (CA8 1981); Green v. Carlson, 649 F. 2d 285 (CA5
1981); cf. In re Martin-Trigona,737 F. 2d 1254, 1261 (CA2 1984) ("Federal
courts have both the inherent power and constitutional obligation to protect their jurisdiction from conduct which impairs their ability to carry out
Article III functions").
"Petitioner has repeatedly ignored the letter and spirit of this Court's
Rule 26, which provides in part that, "[t]o justify the granting of [an extraordinary writ], it must be shown that the writ will be in aid of the
Court's appellate jurisdiction, that there are present exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of the Court's discretionary powers, and
that adequate relief cannot be had in any other form or from any other
court."

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

We have emphasized that extraordinary writs are, not surprisingly, "drastic and extraordinary remedies," to be "reserved for really extraordinary causes," in which "appeal is
clearly an inadequate remedy." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S.
258, 259, 260 (1947).
Petitioner remains free under the present order to file in
forma pauperis requests for relief other than an extraordinary writ, if he qualifies under this Court's Rule 46 and does
not similarly abuse that privilege.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.

In the first such act in its almost 200-year history, the
Court today bars its door to a litigant prospectively. Jessie
McDonald may well have abused his right to file petitions in
this Court without payment of the docketing fee; the Court's
order documents that fact. I do not agree, however, that he
poses such a threat to the orderly administration of justice
that we should embark on the unprecedented and dangerous
course the Court charts today.
The Court's denial not just of McDonald's present petition
but also of his right to file for extraordinary writs in forma
pauperisin the future is, first of all, of questionable legality.
The federal courts are authorized by 28 U. S. C. § 1915 to
permit filings in forma pauperis. The statute is written
permissively, but it establishes a comprehensive scheme for
the administration of in forma pauperis filings. Nothing in
it suggests we have any authority to accept in forma pauperis pleadings from some litigants but not from others on the
basis of how many times they have previously sought our review. Indeed, if anything, the statutory language forecloses
the action the Court takes today. Section 1915(d) explains
the circumstances in which an in forma pauperis pleading
may be dismissed as follows: a court "may dismiss the case if

J., dissenting

the allegation of poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the
action is frivolous or malicious." (Emphasis added.) This
language suggests an individualized assessment of frivolousness or maliciousness that the Court's prospective order precludes. As one lower court has put it, a court's discretion to
dismiss informa pauperis cases summarily "is limited.

. .

in

every case by the language of the statute itself which restricts its application to complaints found to be frivolous
or malicious." Sills v. Bureau of Prisons, 245 U. S. App.
D. C. 389, 391, 761 F. 2d 792, 794 (1985) (emphasis added).
Needless to say, the future petitions McDonald is barred
from filing have not been "found to be" frivolous. Even a
very strong and well-founded belief that McDonald's future
filings will be frivolous cannot render a before-the-fact disposition compatible with the individualized determination § 1915
contemplates.
This Court's Rule 46 governs our practice in cases filed in
forma pauperis. No more than § 1915 does it grant us authority to disqualify a litigant from future use of in forma
pauperis status. Indeed, Rule 46.4 would seem to forbid
such a practice, for it specifies that when the filing requirements described by Rule 46 are complied with, the Clerk
''will file" the litigant's papers "and place the case on the
docket." Today we order the Clerk to refuse to do just that.
Of course we are free to amend our own rules should we see
the need to do so, but until we do we are bound by them.
Even if the legality of our action in ordering the Clerk
to refuse future petitions for extraordinary writs in forma
pauperis from this litigant were beyond doubt, I would still
oppose it as unwise, potentially dangerous, and a departure
from the traditional principle that the door to this courthouse
is open to all.
The Court's order purports to be motivated by this litigant's disproportionate consumption of the Court's time and
resources. Yet if his filings are truly as repetitious as it
appears, it hardly takes much time to identify them as such.

IN RE

McDONALD

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

I find it difficult to see how the amount of time and resources
required to deal properly with McDonald's petitions could be
so great as to justify the step we now take. Indeed, the time
that has been consumed in the preparation of the present
order barring the door to Mr. McDonald far exceeds that
which would have been necessary to process his petitions for
the next several years at least. I continue to find puzzling
the Court's fervor in ensuring that rights granted to the poor
are not abused, even when so doing actually increases the
drain on our limited resources. Cf. Brown v. Herald Co.,
464 U. S. 928 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). Today's
order makes sense as an efficiency measure only if it is
merely the prelude to similar orders in regard to other litigants, or perhaps to a generalized rule limiting the number of
petitions in forma pauperis an individual may file. Therein
lies its danger.
The Court's order itself seems to indicate that further
measures, at least in regard to this litigant, may be forthcoming. It notes that McDonald remains free to file in forma
pauperis for relief other than extraordinary writs, if he "does
not similarly abuse that privilege." Ante, at 185. But if we
have found his 19 petitions for extraordinary writs abusive,
how long will it be until we conclude that his 33 petitions for
certiorari are similarly abusive and bar that door to him as
well? I am at a loss to say why, logically, the Court's order
is limited to extraordinary writs, and I can only conclude that
this order will serve as precedent for similar actions in the
future, both as to this litigant and to others.
I doubt - although I am not certain - that any of the peti-

tions Jessie McDonald is now prevented from filing would
ultimately have been found meritorious. I am most concerned, however, that if, as I fear, we continue on the course
we chart today, we will end by closing our doors to a litigant with a meritorious claim. It is rare, but it does happen
on occasion that we grant review and even decide in favor
of a litigant who previously had presented multiple unsuc-

cessful petitions on the same issue. See, e. g., Chessman v.
Teets, 354 U. S. 156 (1957); see id., at 173-177 (Douglas, J.,
dissenting).
This Court annually receives hundreds of petitions, most
but not all of them filed in forma pauperis, which raise no
colorable legal claim whatever, much less a question worthy
of the Court's review. Many come from individuals whose
mental or emotional stability appears questionable. It does
not take us long to identify these petitions as frivolous and to
reject them. A certain expenditure of resources is required,
but it is not great in relation to our work as a whole. To rid
itself of a small portion of this annoyance, the Court now
needlessly departs from its generous tradition and improvidently sets sail on a journey whose landing point is uncertain.
We have long boasted that our door is open to all. We can no
longer.
For the reasons stated in Brown v. Herald Co., supra,
I would deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without reaching the merits of the motion to proceed in forma
pauperis. For the reasons stated above, I dissent from the
Court's order directing the Clerk not to accept future petitions in forma pauperis for extraordinary writs from this
petitioner.
