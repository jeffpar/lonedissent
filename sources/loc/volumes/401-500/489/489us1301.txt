OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS

BROTHERHOOD OF RAILROAD SIGNALMEN

ET AL. V.

SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE INJUNCTION
No. A-715.

Decided March 14, 1989.

Application to vacate the injunction issued by the District Court is denied.

Circuit Justice.
Applicants request me, as Circuit Justice, to enter an
order "immediately dissolving" the injunction issued by the
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I
deny the application. In my view, applicants have not "established that there is a 'reasonable probability' that four
Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to
grant certiorari." Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308
