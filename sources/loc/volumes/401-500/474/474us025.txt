LANIER v. SOUTH CAROLINA

Per Curiam

LANIER v. SOUTH CAROLINA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF
APPEALS OF SOUTH CAROLINA
No. 85-5260.

Decided November 4, 1985

Petitioner, who was convicted of armed robbery, contended that the South
Carolina trial court should have suppressed his confession as being the
product of an illegal arrest. The South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that, even assuming petitioner's arrest
was illegal, the confession was admissible because voluntariness was the
test of admissibility and petitioner did not claim that his confession was
not voluntary.
Held: The South Carolina Court of Appeals' judgment is vacated, and the
case is remanded, because the court's reasoning is inconsistent with wellestablished precedent holding that a finding of voluntariness of a confession for Fifth Amendment purposes is not by itself sufficient to purge
the taint of an illegal arrest, but is merely a threshold requirement for
Fourth Amendment analysis.
Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted. The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted.
Petitioner was convicted of armed robbery. He contends
that his confession should have been suppressed because it
was the product of an illegal arrest. The South Carolina
Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's rejection of his
motion to suppress the confession:
"Assuming, without deciding, that Lanier's arrest was
illegal, we nevertheless hold his confession was admissible. A confession made while the accused is in custody
before any warrant for his arrest has been issued is not
per se inadmissible. State v. Funchess, 255 S. C. 385,
179 S. E. 2d 25, cert. denied, 404 U. S. 915, 92 S. Ct.
236, 30 L. Ed. 2d 189 (1971). Voluntariness remains as
the test of admissibility. Id. Even if the arrest was

illegal, the confession will be admissible if it is freely and
voluntarily given. State v. Plath, 277 S. C. 126, 284
S. E. 2d 221 (1981). Since Lanier does not claim his
confession was not voluntary, his argument that the
confession was inadmissible is without merit." App. to
Pet. for Cert. A-2.
The South Carolina Supreme Court declined further review.
Under well-established precedent, "the fact that [a] confession may be 'voluntary' for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, in the sense that Miranda warnings were given and
understood, is not by itself sufficient to purge the taint of the
illegal arrest. In this situation, a finding of 'voluntariness'
for purposes of the Fifth Amendment is merely a threshold
requirement for Fourth Amendment analysis." Taylor v.
Alabama, 457 U. S.687, 690 (1982). See also Dunaway v.
New York, 442 U. S.200, 217-218 (1979); Brown v. Illinois,
422 U. S.590, 602 (1975). The reasoning of the South Carolina Court of Appeals is inconsistent with those cases. We
therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case to that
court for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE

O'CONNOR,

with whom JUSTICE REHNQUIST

joins, concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the judgment of the Court vacating the judgment and remanding this case to the South Carolina Court of
Appeals. For the reasons stated in my opinion in Taylor v.
Alabama, 457 U. S.687, 694 (1982) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting), I believe the court on remand can consider the timing,
frequency, and likely effect of whatever Miranda warnings
were given to petitioner as factors relevant to the question
whether, if petitioner was illegally arrested, his subsequent
confession was tainted by the illegal arrest.
JUSTICE MARSHALL dissents from this summary disposition, which has been ordered without affording the parties
prior notice or an opportunity to file briefs on the merits.
