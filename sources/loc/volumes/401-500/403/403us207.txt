ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

No. 79.

Argued November 19, 1970-Decided June 7, 1971

Florida's statutory loyalty oath provision requiring a Florida public
employee as an employment condition to swear that he will support the Federal and State Constitutions is constitutionally valid.
The portion of the oath requiring him to swear that he does not
believe in the violent overthrow of the Federal or State Government is invalid as providing for his dismissal without hearing or
inquiry required by due process.
305 F. Supp. 445, affirmed in part, reversed in part.

Sanford Jay Rosen argued the cause for appellant.
With him on the brief were Tobias Simon and Melvin L.

Wulf.

PER

CURIAM.

This is an appeal from an action commenced in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of
Florida challenging the constitutionality of §§ 876.05876.10 of Fla. Stat. (1965), and the various loyalty oaths
upon which appellant's employment as a school teacher
was conditioned. The three-judge U. S. District Court
declared three of the five clauses contained in the oaths
to be unconstitutional,* and enjoined the State from con* The clauses declared unconstitutional by the court below required
the employee to swear: (a) "that I am not a member of the Communist Party"; (b) "that I have not and will not lend my aid,
support, advice, counsel or influence to the Communist Party"; and
(c) "that I am not a member of any organization or party which
believes in or teaches, directly or indirectly, the overthrow of the
Government of the United States or of Florida by force or violence."

ditioning employment on the taking of an oath including
the language declared unconstitutional. The appeal is
from that portion of the District Court decision which
upheld the remaining two clauses in the oath: I do hereby
solemnly swear or affirm (1) "that I will support the
Constitution of the United States and of the State of
Florida"; and (2) "that I do not believe in the overthrow
of the Government of the United States or of the State
of Florida by force or violence."
On January 16, 1969, appellant made application for a
teaching position with the Orange County school system.
She was interviewed by the principal of Callahan Elementary School, and on January 27, 1969, appellant was
employed as a substitute classroom teacher in the fourth
grade of that school. Appellant was dismissed from her
teaching position on March 18, 1969, for refusing to sign
the loyalty oath required of all Florida public employees,
Fla. Stat. § 876.05.
The first section of the oath upheld by the District
Court, requiring all applicants to pledge to support the
Constitution of the United States and of the State of Florida, demands no more of Florida public employees than
is required of all state and federal officers. U. S. Const.,
Art. VI, cl. 3. The validity of this section of the oath
would appear settled. See Knight v. Board of Regents,
269 F. Supp. 339 (1967), aff'd per curiam, 390 U. S. 36
(1968); Hosack v. Smiley, 276 F. Supp. 876 (1967), aff'd
per curiam, 390 U. S. 744 (1968); Ohlson v. Phillips,
304 F. Supp. 1152 (1969), aff'd per curiam, 397 U. S. 317
(1970).
The second portion of the oath, approved by the District Court, falls within the ambit of decisions of this
Court proscribing summary dismissal from public employment without hearing or inqluiry required by due
process. Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551

(1956). Cf. Nostrand v. Little, 362 U. S. 474 (1960);
Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958). That portion
of the oath, therefore, cannot stand.
Affirmed in part, and reversed in part.

the result.
I agree that Florida may require state employees to
affirm that they "will support the Constitution of the
United States and of the State of Florida." Such a forward-looking, promissory oath of constitutional support
does not in my view offend the First Amendment's command that the grant or denial of governmental benefits
cannot be made to turn on the political viewpoints or
affiliations of a would-be beneficiary. I also agree that
Florida may not base its employment decisions, as to
state teachers or any other hiring category, on an applicant's willingness vel non to affirm "that I do not believe
in the overthrow of the Government of the United States
or of the State of Florida by force or violence."
However, in striking down the latter oath, the Court
has left the clear implication that its objection runs, not
against Florida's determination to exclude those who
"believe in the overthrow," but only against the State's
decision to regard unwillingness to take the oath as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of the proscribed belief. Due
process may rightly be invoked to condemn Florida's
mechanistic approach to the question of proof. But in
my view it simply does not matter what kind of evidence
a State can muster to show that a job applicant "believe[s] in the overthrow." For state action injurious
to an individual cannot be justified on account of the
nature of the individual's beliefs, whether he "believe[s]
in the overthrow" or has any other sort of belief. "If

there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe
what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion,
or other matters of opinion . . . ." Board of Education
v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943).
I would strike down Florida's "overthrow" oath plainly
and simply on the ground that belief as such cannot be
the predicate of governmental action.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
The Court upholds as clearly constitutional the first
clause of the oath as it comes to us from the three-judge
District Court: "I will support the Constitution of the
United States and of the State of Florida . . . ." With
this ruling I fully agree.
As to the second contested clause of the oath, "I do
not believe in the overthrow of the Government of the
United States or of the State of Florida by force or
violence," I would remand to the District Court to give
the parties an opportunity to get from the state courts
an authoritative construction of the meaning of the
clause. If the clause embraces the teacher's philosophical or political beliefs, I think it is constitutionally infirm.
Baird v. State Bar of Arizona, 401 U. S. 1, 9-10 (concurring opinion); Board of Educationv. Barnette, 319 U. S.
624, 642; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303304. If, on the other hand, the clause does no more
than test whether the first clause of the oath can be
taken "without mental reservation or purpose of evasion," I think it is constitutionally valid. Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, Inc. v. Wadmond,
401 U. S. 154, 163-164. The Florida courts should,
therefore, be given an opportunity to construe the clause
before the federal courts pass on its constitutionality.
