NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v.
TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT
No. 82-168.

Argued March 28, 1983-Decided June 15, 1983

Acting on unfair labor practice charges filed by an employee of respondent,
petitioner National Labor Relations Board found that respondent had
discharged the employee, a busdriver, for his union activities, in violation of §§ 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act. The
Board applied its rule that the General Counsel has the burden of persuading the Board by a preponderance of the evidence that an antiunion
animus contributed to the employer's decision to discharge the employee, and the employer can avoid the conclusion that it violated the Act
by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would
have been fired for permissible reasons even if he had not been involved
in protected union activities. The Board concluded that respondent
failed to carry its burden of persuading the Board that the employee's
discharge would have taken place, even if he had not been engaged in
protected union activities, because of his practice of leaving his keys in
the bus and taking unauthorized breaks. The Court of Appeals refused
to enforce the Board's order, based on its view that it was error to place
the burden on the employer, and that the General Counsel carried the
burden of proving not only that a forbidden motivation contributed to the
discharge but also that the discharge would not have taken place independently of the employee's protected conduct.
Held:
1. The burden of proof placed on the employer under the Board's rule
is consistent with §§ 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3), as well as with § 10(c) of the Act,
which provides that the Board must find an unfair labor practice by a
"preponderance of the testimony." The Board's construction of the statute, which is not mandated by the Act, extends to the employer what the
Board considers to be an affirmative defense but does not change or add
to the elements of the unfair labor practice that the General Counsel has
the burden of proving under § 10(c). This is a permissible construction,
and the Board's allocation of the burden of proof is reasonable. Cf. Mt.

delivered the opinion of the Court.

The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 29
U. S. C. § 151 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. V), makes unlawful
the discharge of a worker because of union activity, §§ 8(a)(1),
(3), as amended, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U. S. C. §§ 158(a)(1), (3),1 but
employers retain the right to discharge workers for any number of other reasons unrelated to the employee's union activities. When the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (Board) files a complaint alleging that an employee
was discharged because of his union activities, the employer

Noble, Jr., and Stephen A. Bokat for the Chamber of Commerce of the

Section 8(a), as set forth in 29 U. S. C. § 158(a), provides, in relevant
part:
"It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer"(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of
the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;
"(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any
term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership
in any labor organization. .. ."

may assert legitimate motives for his decision. In Wright
Line, 251 N. L. R. B. 1083 (1980), enf'd, 662 F. 2d 899 (CA1
1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 989 (1982), the Board reformulated the allocation of the burden of proof in such cases. It
determined that the General Counsel carried the burden of
persuading the Board that an antiunion animus contributed
to the employer's decision to discharge an employee, a burden that does not shift, but that the employer, even if it failed
to meet or neutralize the General Counsel's showing, could
avoid the finding that it violated the statute by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the worker
would have been fired even if he had not been involved with
the union. The question presented in this case is whether
the burden placed on the employer in Wright Line is consistent with §§ 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3), as well as with § 10(c) of the
NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 160(c), which provides that the Board
must find an unfair labor practice by a "preponderance of the
testimony. "2
Prior to his discharge, Sam Santillo was a busdriver for

respondent Transportation Management Corp. On March
19, 1979, Santillo talked to officials of the Teamster's Union
about organizing the drivers who worked with him.

discharged for cause." 29 U. S. C. § 160(c).

the next four days Santillo discussed with his fellow drivers
the possibility of joining the Teamsters and distributed
authorization cards. On the night of March 23, George Patterson, who supervised Santillo and the other drivers, told
one of the drivers that he had heard of Santillo's activities.
Patterson referred to Santillo as two-faced, and promised to
get even with him.
Later that evening Patterson talked to Ed West, who was
also a busdriver for respondent. Patterson asked, "What's
with Sam and the Union?" Patterson said that he. took
Santillo's actions personally, recounted several favors he had
done for Santillo, and added that he would remember Santillo's activities when Santillo again asked for a favor. On
Monday, March 26, Santillo was discharged. Patterson told
Santillo that he was being fired for leaving his keys in the bus
and taking unauthorized breaks.
Santillo filed a complaint with the Board alleging that he
had been discharged because of his union activities, contrary
to §§ 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the NLRA. The General Counsel
issued a complaint. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)
determined by a preponderance of the evidence that Patterson clearly had an antiunion animus and that Santillo's discharge was motivated by a desire to discourage union activities. The ALJ also found that the asserted reasons for the
discharge could not withstand scrutiny. Patterson's disapproval of Santillo's practice of leaving his keys in the bus
was clearly a pretext, for Patterson had not known about
Santillo's practice until after he had decided to discharge Santillo; moreover, the practice of leaving keys in buses was
commonplace among respondent's employees. Respondent
identified two types of unauthorized breaks, coffeebreaks and
stops at home. With respect to both coffeebreaks and stopping at home, the ALJ found that Santillo was never
cautioned or admonished about such behavior, and that the
employer had not followed its customary practice of issuing
three written warnings before discharging a driver. The

NLRB v. TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CORP.
393

Opinion of the Court

ALJ also found that the taking of coffeebreaks during working hours was normal practice, and that respondent tolerated
the practice unless the breaks interfered with the driver's
performance of his duties. In any event, said the ALJ,
respondent had never taken any adverse personnel action
against an employee because of such behavior. While
acknowledging that Santillo had engaged in some unsatisfactory conduct, the ALJ was not persuaded that Santillo would
have been fired had it not been for his union activities.
The Board affirmed, adopting with some clarification the
ALJ's findings and conclusions and expressly applying its
Wright Line decision. It stated that respondent had failed
to carry its burden of persuading the Board that the discharge would have taken place had Santillo not engaged in
activity protected by the Act. The Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit, relying on its previous decision rejecting the
Board's Wright Line test, NLRB v. Wright Line, 662 F.
2d 899 (1981), refused to enforce the Board's order and
remanded for consideration of whether the General Counsel
had proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Santillo
would not have been fired had it not been for his union activities. 674 F. 2d 130 (1982). We granted certiorari, 459
U. S. 1014 (1982), because of conflicts on the issue among the
Courts of Appeals. 3 We now reverse.
Employees of an employer covered by the NLRA have the

§ 8(a)(1), 29 U. S. C. § 158(a)(1), or by discrimination in hire
or tenure "to encourage or discourage membership in any
labor organization," NLRA § 8(a)(3), 29 U. S. C. § 158(a)(3).
Under these provisions it is undisputed that if the employer fires an employee for having engaged in union activities and has no other basis for the discharge, or if the reasons
that he proffers are pretextual, the employer commits an
unfair labor practice. He does not violate the NLRA, however, if any antiunion animus that he might have entertained
did not contribute at all to an otherwise lawful discharge for
good cause. Soon after the passage of the Act, the Board
held that it was an *unfairlabor practice for an employer to
discharge a worker where antiunion animus actually contributed to the discharge decision. Consumers Research,
Inc., 2 N. L. R. B. 57, 73 (1936); Louisville Refining Co.,
4 N. L. R. B. 844, 861 (1938), enf'd, 102 F. 2d 678 (CA6),
cert. denied, 308 U. S. 568 (1939); Dow Chemical Co., 13
N. L. R. B. 993, 1023 (1939), enif'd in relevant part, 117 F.
2d 455 (CA6 1941); Republic Creosoting Co., 19 N. L. R. B.
267, 294 (1940). In Consumers Research, the Board rejected the position that "antecedent to a finding of violation
of the Act, it must be found that the sole motive for
discharge was the employee's union activity." It explained
that "[s]uch an interpretation is repugnant to the purpose
and meaning of the Act, and . . . may not be made." 2
N. L. R. B., at 73. In its Third Annual Report, the Board
stated: "Where the employer has discharged an employee
for two or more reasons, and one of them is union affiliation
or activity, the Board has found a violation [of § 8(a)(3)]."
3 NLRB Ann. Rep. 70 (1938). In the following year in
Dow Chemical Co., supra, the Board stated that a violation
could be found where the employer acted out of antiunion
bias "whether or not the [employer] may have had some
other motive ... and without regard to whether or not the
[employer's] asserted motive was lawful." 13 N. L. R. B.,
at 1023. This construction of the Act-that to establish an

NLRB v. TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CORP.
393

Opinion of the Court

unfair labor practice the General Counsel need show by a preponderance of the evidence only that a discharge is in any
way motivated by a desire to frustrate union activity-was
plainly rational and acceptable. The Board has adhered to
that construction of the Act since that time.
At the same time, there were decisions indicating that the
presence of an antiunion motivation in a discharge case was
not the end of the matter. An employer could escape the
consequences of a violation by proving that without regard
to the impermissible motivation, the employer would have
taken the same action for wholly permissible reasons. See,
e. g., Eagle-PicherMining & Smelting Co., 16 N. L. R. B.
727, 801 (1939), enf'd in relevant part, 119 F. 2d 903 (CA8
1941); BordenMills, Inc., 13 N. L. R. B. 459, 474-475 (1939);
Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 69 N. L. R. B. 440, 454, n. 21
(1946), enf'd, 161 F. 2d 798 (CA5 1947). 4
The Courts of Appeals were not entirely satisfied with the
Board's approach to dual-motive cases. The Board's Wright
'The Board argues that its approach to mixed-motive cases was known
to Congress and ratified by the passage of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), 61 Stat. 136, which reenacted §§8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3)
almost without material change. We need not pass on this submission,
since we find nothing in the legislative history of the LMRA that calls into

question the decisions of the Board relevant to the issue before us now.
The issue after, as well as before, the passage of the LMRA is whether the
Board's construction of § 8(a) is sufficiently rational to be acceptable in the
courts. We do note that nowhere in the legislative history is reference
made to any of the mixed-motive cases decided by the Board or by the
courts, see, e. g., NLRB v. Remington Rand, Inc., 94 F. 2d 862, 872 (CA2)
(L. Hand, J.) ("[S]ince the refusal [to negotiate] was at least one cause of
the strike, and was a tort ... it rested upon the tortfeasor to disentangle
the consequences for which it was chargeable from those from which it was
immune"), cert. denied, 304 U. S. 576 (1938); NLRB v. Stackpole Carbon
Co., 105 F. 2d 167, 176 (CA3), cert. denied, 308 U. S. 605 (1939); Borden
Mills, Inc., 13 N. L. R. B., at 474-475 (dicta); Davis PrecisionMachine
Co., 64 N. L. R. B. 529, 537 (1945); Wright-Hibbard IndustrialElectric
Truck Co., 67 N. L. R. B. 897, 908, n. 15 (1946); Robbins Tire and Rubber

Line decision in 1980 was an attempt to restate its analysis in
a way more acceptable to the Courts of Appeals. The Board
held that the General Counsel of course had the burden of
proving that the employee's conduct protected by § 7 was a

substantial or a motivating factor in the discharge. 5 Even if
this was the case, and the employer failed to rebut it, the employer could avoid being held in violation of §§ 8(a)(1) and'
8(a)(3) by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that
the discharge rested on the employee's unprotected conduct
as well and that the employee would have lost his job in any
event. It thus became clear, if it was not clear before, that
proof that the discharge would have occurred in any event
and for valid reasons amounted to an affirmative defense on
which the employer carried the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. "The shifting burden merely requires the employer to make out what is actually an affirmative defense ...

."

Wright Line, 251 N. L. R. B., at 1088,

n. 11; see also id., at 1084, n. 5.
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit refused enforcement of the Wright Line decision because in its view it was
error to place the burden on the employer to prove that the
discharge would have occurred had the forbidden motive not
been present. The General Counsel, the Court of Appeals
held, had the burden of showing not only that a forbidden
'The Board has not purported to shift the burden of persuasion on the
question of whether the employer fired Santillo at least in part because he
engaged in protected activities. The General Counsel satisfied his burden
in this respect and no one disputes it. Thus, Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 (1981), is inapposite. In that
case, which involved a claim of racial discrimination in violation of Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq. (1976 ed. and
Supp. V), the question was who had "[t]he ultimate burden of persuading
the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the
plaintiff .... " 450 U. S., at 253. The Court discussed only the situation
in which the issue is whether either illegal or legal motives, but not both,
were the "true" motives behind the decision. It thus addressed the pretext case.

NLRB v. TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CORP.

Opinion of the Court

motivation contributed to the discharge but also that the discharge would not have taken place independently of the protected conduct of the employee. The Court of Appeals was
quite correct, and the Board does not disagree, that throughout the proceedings, the General Counsel carries the burden
of proving the elements of an unfair labor practice. Section
10(c) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 160(c), expressly directs that
violations may be adjudicated only "upon the preponderance of the testimony" taken by the Board. The Board's
rules also state that "[tihe Board's attorney has the burden
of pro[ving] violations of Section 8." 29 CFR §101.10(b)
(1982). We are quite sure, however, that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that § 10(c) forbids placing the burden
on the employer to prove that absent the improper motivation he would have acted in the same manner for wholly
legitimate reasons.
As we understand the Board's decisions, they have consistently held that the unfair labor practice consists of a discharge or other adverse action that is based in whole or in
part on antiunion animus-or as the Board now puts it, that
the employee's protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action. The General Counsel
has the burden of proving these elements under § 10(c). But
the Board's construction of the statute permits an employer
to avoid being adjudicated a violator by showing what his actions would have been regardless of his forbidden motivation.
It extends to the employer what the Board considers to be an
affirmative defense but does not change or add to the elements of the unfair labor practice that the General Counsel
has the burden of proving under § 10(c). 6

We assume that

'The language of the NLRA requiring that the Board act on a preponderance of the testimony taken was added by the LMRA, 61 Stat. 136, in
1947. A closely related provision directed that no order of the Board reinstate or compensate any employee who was fired for cause. Section 10(c)
places the burden on the General Counsel only to prove the unfair labor
practice, not to disprove an affirmative defense. Furthermore, it is clear

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

462 U. S.

the Board could reasonably have construed the Act in the
manner insisted on by the Court of Appeals. We also assume that the Board might have considered a showing by the
employer that the adverse action would have occurred in-any
event as not obviating a violation adjudication but as going
only to the permissible remedy, in which event the burden of
proof could surely have been put on the employer. The
Board has instead chosen to recognize, as it insists it has done
for many years, what it designates as an affirmative defense
that the employer has the burden of sustaining. We are unprepared to hold that this is an impermissible construction of
the Act. "[T]he Board's construction here, while it may not
from the legislative history of the LMRA that the drafters of § 10(c) were
not thinking of the mixed-motive case. Their discussions reflected the
assumption that discharges were either "for cause" or punishment for
protected activity. Read fairly, the legislative history does not indicate
whether, in mixed-motive cases, the employer or the General Counsel has
the burden of proof on the issue of what would have happened if the employer had not been influenced by his unlawful motives; on that point the
legislative history is silent.
The "for cause" proviso was not meant to apply to cases in which both
legitimate and illegitimate causes contributed to the discharge, see infra.
The amendment was sparked by a concern over the Board's perceived
practice of inferring from the fact that someone was active in a union that
he was fired because of antiunion animus even though the worker had been
guilty of gross misconduct. The House Report explained the change in the
following terms:
"A third change forbids the Board to reinstate an individual unless the
weight of the evidence shows that the individual was not suspended or discharged for cause. In the past, the Board, admitting that an employee
was guilty of gross misconduct, nevertheless frequently reinstated him, 'nferring' that, because he was a member or an official of a union, this, not his
misconduct, was the reason for his discharge." H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th
Cong., 1st Sess., 42 (1947) (emphasis added).
The proviso was thus a reaction to the Board's readiness to infer antiunion
animus from the fact that the discharged person was active in the union,
and thus has little to do with the situation in which the Board has soundly
concluded that the employer had an antiunion animus and that such feelings played a role in a worker's discharge.

be required by the Act, is at least permissible under it... ,"
and in these circumstances its position is entitled to deference. NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 266-267
(1975); NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U. S. 221, 236
(1963).
The Board's allocation of the burden of proof is clearly reasonable in this context, for the reason stated in NLRB v.
Remington Rand, Inc., 94 F. 2d 862, 872 (CA2), cert. denied,
304 U. S. 576 (1938), a case on which the Board relied when
it began taking the position that the burden of persuasion
could be shifted. E. g., Eagle-PicherMining & Smelting,
16 N. L. R. B., at 801. The employer is a wrongdoer; he
has acted out of a motive that is declared illegitimate by the
statute. It is fair that he bear the risk that the influence of
legal and illegal motives cannot be separated, because he
knowingly created the risk and because the risk was created
not by innocent activity but by his own wrongdoing.
In Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429
U. S. 274 (1977), we found it prudent, albeit in a case implicating the Constitution, to set up an allocation of the burden
of proof which the Board heavily relied on and borrowed from
in its Wright Line decision. There, we held that the plaintiff
had to show that the employer's disapproval of his First
Amendment protected expression played a role in the employer's decision to discharge him. If that burden of persuasion were carried, the burden would be on the defendant to
show by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have
reached the same decision even if, hypothetically, he had not
been motivated by a desire to punish plaintiff for exercising his First Amendment rights. The analogy to Mt. Healthy
drawn by the Board was a fair one.7

Respondent also argues that placement of the burden of persuasion on
the employer contravenes § 10(b) of the Act and § 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. § 556(d). Section 10(b) provides that
the Federal Rules of Evidence apply to Board proceedings insofar as practicable. Respondent contends that Federal Rule of Evidence 301 requires

OCTOBER TERM; 1982
Opinion of the Court

462 U. S.

For these reasons, we conclude that the Court of Appeals
erred in refusing to enforce the Board's orders, which rested
on the Board's Wright Line decision.
The Board was justified in this case in concluding that
Santillo would not have been discharged had the employer
not considered his efforts to establish a union. At least two
of the transgressions that purportedly would have in any
event prompted Santillo's discharge were commonplace, and
yet no transgressor had ever before received any kind of discipline. Moreover, the employer departed from its usual practice in dealing with rules infractions; indeed, not only did the
employer not warn Santillo that his actions would result in
being subjected to discipline, it also never even expressed its
disapproval of his conduct. In addition, Patterson, the person who made the initial decision to discharge Santillo, was
obviously upset with Santillo for engaging in such protected
that the burden of persuasion rest on the General Counsel. Rule 301
provides:
"In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of
Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against
whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or
meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof
in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the
trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast."
The Rule merely defines the term "presumption." It in no way restricts
the authority of a court or an agency to change the customary burdens of
persuasion in a manner that otherwise would be permissible. Indeed,
were respondent correct, we could not have assigned to the defendant the
burden of persuasion on one issue in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education
v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977).
Section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. § 556(d),
provides that the proponent of an order has the burden of proof. Since the
General Counsel is the proponent of the order, asserts respondent, the
General Counsel must bear the burden of proof. Section 7(c), however,
determines only the burden of going forward, not the burden of persuasion.

activity. It is thus clear that the Board's finding that Santillo would not have been fired if the employer had not had an
antiunion animus was "supported by substantial evidence on
the record considered as a whole," 29 U. S. C. § 160(f).
Accordingly, the judgment is
Reversed.
