SMITH v. OHIO
Per Curiam

SMITH v. OHIO
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE
SUPREME COURT OF OHIO
No. 89-5999.

Decided March 5, 1990

As petitioner Smith was approached by two police officers, he threw the
bag he was carrying onto his car's hood and, when asked, refused to
reveal its contents. Although he attempted to protect the bag, one
officer opened it and discovered drug paraphernalia that provided probable cause for Smith's arrest and evidence to support his conviction
for drug abuse. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the bag's warrantless
search under the exception for searches incident to arrest, finding that
the search was constitutional because its fruits justified the arrest that
followed.
Held: A warrantless search providing probable cause for an arrest cannot
be justified as an incident of that arrest. While the incident to arrest
exception permits the police to search a lawfully arrested individual and
areas within his immediate control, it does not permit them to search any
citizen without a warrant or probable cause so long as an arrest follows.
Contrary to the State's argument, a citizen who attempts to protect his
private property from inspection, after throwing it on a car to respond to
a police officer's inquiry, clearly has not abandoned his property.
Certiorari granted; 45 Ohio St. 3d 255, 544 N. E. 2d 239, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

This case raises the single question whether a warrantless
search that provides probable cause for an arrest can nonetheless be justified as an incident of that arrest. A divided
Ohio Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative, reasoning that the search was neither remote in time
nor place from the arrest. We disagree.
On a June evening, as petitioner and a companion exited
a private residence and entered the parking lot of a YMCA,
they were approached by two plainclothes officers of the Ashland, Ohio, Police Department. The officers were driving
in an unmarked police vehicle. Petitioner was carrying a

brown paper grocery bag with the words "Kash 'n Karry"
and "Loaded with Low Prices" printed on the outside in a
manner that the officers later described as "gingerly." Neither officer knew petitioner or his companion. One of the
two officers, Officer Thomas, exited the vehicle and, without
identifying himself, asked petitioner to "'come here a minute."' 45 Ohio St. 3d 255, 256, 544 N. E. 2d 239, 240 (1989).
Petitioner did not respond and kept walking. When Officer
Thomas identified himself as a police officer, petitioner
"threw the sack he was carrying onto the hood of [his] car
and turned to face Thomas who was approaching." Ibid.
Officer Thomas asked petitioner what the bag contained;
petitioner did not respond; Officer Thomas then rebuffed
petitioner's attempt to protect the bag, pushed petitioner's
hand away, and opened the bag. The drug paraphernalia
discovered within provided probable cause for the arrest and
evidence sufficient to support petitioner's conviction for drug
abuse.
No contention has been raised in this case that the officer's
reaching for the bag involved a self-protective action necessary for the officer's safety. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1
(1968). Although the Fourth Amendment may permit a brief
detention of property on the basis of only "reasonable, articulable suspicion" that it contains contraband or evidence
of criminal activity, United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696,
702 (1983), it proscribes -except in certain well-defined circumstances -the search of that property unless accomplished
pursuant to judicial warrant issued upon probable cause.
See, e. g., Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489
U. S. 602, 619 (1989); Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390
(1978); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967).
That guarantee protects alike the "traveler who carries a
toothbrush and a few articles of clothing in a paper bag" and
"the sophisticated executive with the locked attach6 case."
United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 822 (1982). The Ohio
Supreme Court upheld the warrantless search of petition-

er's bag under the exception for searches incident to arrest.
See United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1977);
Chimel v. California,395 U. S. 752, 763 (1969). The court
stated that petitioner was not arrested until after the contraband was discovered in the search of the bag. 45 Ohio St.
3d, at 257, 258, 544 N. E. 2d, at 241, 242. It nonetheless
held that the search was constitutional because its fruits justified the arrest that followed.
That reasoning, however, "justify[ing] the arrest by the
search and at the same time . . . the search by the arrest,"
just "will not do." Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10,
16-17 (1948). As we have had occasion in the past to observe, "[i]t is axiomatic that an incident search may not precede an arrest and serve as part of its justification." Sibron
v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 63 (1968); see also Henry v.
United States, 361 U. S. 98, 102 (1959); Rawlings v. Kentucky, 448 U. S. 98, 111, n. 6 (1980).
The exception for
searches incident to arrest permits the police to search a lawfully arrested person and areas within his immediate control.
Contrary to the Ohio Supreme Court's reasoning, it does not
permit the police to search any citizen without a warrant or
probable cause so long as an arrest immediately follows.
The State does not defend the reasoning of the Ohio Supreme Court, but rather contends that petitioner abandoned
the bag when he threw it on his car and turned to face Officer Thomas. See Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217, 241
(1960); Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57, 58 (1924).
That argument was unanimously rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court, 45 Ohio St. 3d, at 263, n. 6, 544 N. E. 2d,
at 246, n. 6; id., at 266, 544 N. E. 2d, at 249 (Sweeney, J.,
dissenting); id., at 273-274, 544 N. E. 2d, at 255, n. 10
(Wright, J., dissenting), and we have no reason to disturb its
conclusion. As the state court properly recognized, a citizen
who attempts to protect his private property from inspection,
after throwing it on a car to respond to a police officer's in-

dissenting.
Although I agree that the limited information before us
appears to indicate that the Ohio Supreme Court erred in its
decision below, I continue to believe that summary dispositions deprive litigants of a fair opportunity to be heard on
the merits and significantly increase the risk of an erroneous
decision. See Pennsylvania v. Bruder, 488 U. S. 9, 11-12
(1988) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Rhodes v. Stewart, 488
U. S. 1, 4-5 (1988) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Buchanan
v. Stanships, Inc., 485 U. S. 265, 269-270 (1988) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Commissionerv. McCoy, 484 U. S. 3,
7-8 (1987) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). I therefore dissent
from the Court's decision today to reverse summarily the
judgment below.
