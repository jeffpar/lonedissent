CALIFORNIA v. BROWN
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-699.

Decided March 27, 1986

California's application to stay the enforcement of the California Supreme
Court's judgment-which invalidated respondent's death sentence for
first-degree murder on the ground that the Eighth Amendment to the
Federal Constitution was violated by a jury instruction given during the
sentencing phase of his trial that told the jury not to be swayed by "mere
sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or
public feeling"-is granted pending disposition of the State's petition for
certiorari. It is likely that four Members of this Court will vote to grant
certiorari to review the jury-instruction issue, and that the decision
below ultimately will be reversed. There is no merit to respondent's argument that the decision below was based on adequate and independent
state grounds, and is therefore unreviewable by this Court. Moreover,
the State has met its burden of demonstrating irreparable harm if its
application for a stay is not granted.
JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

Circuit Justice.

Applicant, the State of California, asks that I stay pending
disposition of its petition for certiorari the enforcement of the
judgment of the California Supreme Court, which invalidated
the death sentence imposed on respondent Brown in 1980 for
the first-degree murder of a 15-year-old girl. See 40 Cal. 3d
512, 709 P. 2d 440 (1986). The California Supreme Court invalidated Brown's death sentence because it believed that
a jury instruction given during the sentencing phase of
Brown's trial, which told the jury that it "must not be swayed
by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling," violated the Eighth

Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court
felt that this instruction was incompatible with our decisions
in Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), which construed the Eighth
Amendment to require that the sentencer in a capital case be
allowed to consider, "as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a
defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances
of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death." Id., at 110, quoting Lockett, supra,
at 604.
I think it is likely that four Members of this Court would
vote to grant certiorari to review the California Supreme
Court's holding that the jury instruction at issue in this case
violated Brown's Eighth Amendment rights under Lockett
and Eddings, and that the decision below ultimately would be
reversed. The California death penalty statute in effect at
the time of Brown's trial expressly permitted Brown to introduce evidence, at sentencing, "as to any matter relevant to
โข.. mitigation ... including, but not limited to, the nature
and circumstances of the present offense, . . . and the de-

fendant's character, background, history, mental condition
and physical condition." Cal. Penal Code Ann. ยง 190.3 (West
Supp. 1986). The California statute also provided:
"In determining the penalty, the trier of fact shall take
into account any of the following factors if relevant:
"(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the
defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and
the existence of any special circumstances found to be
true ....

"(b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by
the defendant which involved the use or attempted use
of force or violence or the express or implied threat to
use force or violence.
"(c) The presence or absence of any prior felony
conviction.

Opinion in Chambers

"(d) Whether or not the offense was committed while
the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental
or emotional disturbance.
"(e) Whether or not the victim was a participant in the
defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act.
"(f) Whether or not the offense was committed under
circumstances which the defendant reasonably believed
to be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.
"(g) Whether or not the defendant acted under extreme duress or under the substantial domination of
another person.
"(h) Whether or not at the time of the offense the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of
his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease
or defect, or the affects [sic] of intoxication.
"(i) The age of the defendant at the time of the crime.
"(j) Whether or not the defendant was an accomplice
to the offense and his participation in the commission of
the offense was relatively minor.
"(k) Any other circumstance which extenuates the
gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse
for the crime." Ibid.
A portion of the jury instructions given at the sentencing
phase of Brown's trial tracked the above statutory language,
thus clearly informing the jury of its constitutional duty to
consider in mitigation all relevant aspects of the defendant's
character and the circumstances of his crime. See California
Jury Instructions-Criminal No. 8.84.1 (4th ed. 1979). In my
view a strong argument can be made that these statutory
provisions, and the instructions which explained them to
Brown's sentencing jury, fully complied with the dictates of
Lockett and Eddings.1
IIn California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992 (1983), we cited these very same
provisions of the California statute and noted:

475 U. S.

The jury instruction held by the California Supreme Court
in this case to be unconstitutional was in no way inconsistent
with the aforementioned statutory provisions. Nor did the
instruction tell the jury to ignore any relevant evidence or
mitigating circumstances. On the contrary, it simply told
the jury not to be swayed by "mere sentiment, conjecture,"
and the like. Such an instruction focuses the jury's attention
on the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn
therefrom. It is consistent with JUSTICE STEVENS' observation in Gardnerv. Florida,430 U. S. 349 (1977), that "[i]t is
of vital importance to the defendant and to the community
that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion."
Id., at 358.2

Brown argues that the decision below was based on adequate and independent state grounds, and is therefore
unreviewable by this Court. It is true that, prior to this
Court's 1972 decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238
(1972), the California Supreme Court had held that a jury instruction identical to the one at issue in this case violated the
State Constitution. See People v. Bandhauer,1 Cal. 3d 609,
618-619, 463 P. 2d 408, 416 (1970). After this Court's 1976
decision in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, however, the
"[R]espondent does not, and indeed could not, contend that the California
sentencing scheme violates the directive of Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586
(1978).
The California statute in question permits the defendant to
present any evidence to show that a penalty less than death is appropriate
in his case." Id., at 1005, n. 19.
'Moreover, in practical terms, I would expect the instruction at issue to
generally help capital defendants, by reducing the possibility that sentencing juries will be swayed by sympathy for the victim, along with other adverse forms of "passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling." See
People v. Easley, 34 Cal. 3d 858, 886, 671 P. 2d 813, 831 (1983) (Mosk, J.,
dissenting) ("In the current climate of public opinion, sympathy is more
likely to be aroused for the victim and his family than for a defendant who
has been found guilty of a brutal first degree murder. Thus cautioning a
jury in the penalty phase of the trial not to be swayed by mere sympathy
redounds to the benefit, not the detriment, of the defendant").

CALIFORNIA v. BROWN
1301

Opinion in Chambers

California Supreme Court revisited the question, treating it
as a matter of federal, not state, constitutional law. See
People v. Robertson, 33 Cal. 3d 21, 56-59, 655 P. 2d 279,
286-287 (1982). In People v. Easley, 34 Cal. 3d 858, 671
P. 2d 813 (1983), the court explained that "the federal cases
following Furman and Gregg do not undermine [the prior]
line of California authority, but, on the contrary, establish
that these decisions are compelled as a matter offederal constitutional law." Id., at 876, 671 P. 2d, at 824 (emphasis
added); see also People v. Lanphear, 36 Cal. 3d 163, 164, 680
P. 2d 1081, 1082 (1984) ("federal constitutional law forbids"
the instruction at issue in this case). Finally, in the instant
case, the court did not cite the State Constitution at all, but
stated that it was relying on "the individualized sentencing
concerns inherent in the Eighth Amendment." 40 Cal. 3d,
at 537, 709 P. 2d, at 453. Thus, it seems that this case is one
in which, "'at the very least, the [state] court felt compelled
by what it understood to be federal constitutional considerations to construe . . . its own law in the manner it did."'
Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 653 (1979), quoting
Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U. S.
562, 568 (1977). As such, we have jurisdiction to review the
California Supreme Court's decision. "If the state court misapprehended federal law, '[i]t should be freed to decide ...
these suits according to its own local law."' Delaware v.
Prouse, supra, at 653, quoting Missouri ex rel. Southern R.
Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1, 5 (1950).
I also think the State has met its burden of demonstrating
irreparable harm if its application for a stay is not granted.
The California Supreme Court denied the State's application
for a stay of issuance of its remittitur, and for an order deferring enforcement of its judgment, and issued the remittitur
to the California Superior Court for Riverside County on January 30, 1986. The remittitur was filed by the Superior
Court on February 3. Under California law, if the State
does not hold a new trial on the issue of Brown's penalty

1306

within 60 days of the filing of the remittitur, or by April 4, it
will be forever barred from seeking the death penalty in the
instant case. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. ยง 1382(2) (West

1982).

On the other hand, since the California Supreme

Court affirmed Brown's murder conviction, his status will be
unaffected by the issuance of a stay pending disposition of the
State's petition for certiorari. Accordingly, I grant the
State's application for a stay.'

3The State's petition for certiorari also asks this Court to review a
portion of the California Supreme Court's opinion in which it placed a new
construction on certain portions of the California death penalty statute in
order to avoid what it perceived to be a potential Eighth Amendment problem. See 40 Cal. 3d 512, 538-545, 709 P. 2d 440, 453-459 (1985). I express no view on whether this Court would be likely to grant certiorari on
this issue, which was not relied upon by the California Supreme Court as
an alternative basis for invalidating Brown's death sentence.
