Syllabus

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS
CERTIORARI TO THE APPELLATE COURT OF ILLINOIS, FIRST
JUDICIAL DISTRICT
No. 81-1843.

Argued March 30, 1983--Decided July 5, 1983

A large, locked metal container, shipped by air from Calcutta to respondent in Chicago, was opened by a customs officer at the airport, who
found a wooden table with marihuana concealed in a compartment. A
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent confirmed that it was
marihuana, and the table and container were resealed. The next day,
the DEA agent and a Chicago police officer posed as delivery men and
delivered the container to respondent, leaving it in the hallway outside
his apartment. The DEA agent stationed himself to keep the container
in sight and observed respondent take the container into his apartment.
When the other officer left to secure a warrant to search the apartment,
the DEA agent maintained surveillance of the apartment. Some 30 or
45 minutes after the delivery, but before the other officer could return
with a warrant, respondent emerged from the apartment with the shipping container and was immediately arrested and taken to the police station; there the container was reopened and the marihuana found inside
the table was seized. No search warrant had been obtained. Prior to
trial on charges of possession of controlled substances, the Illinois state
trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana. The
Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, holding that a "controlled delivery"
had not been made, so as to render a warrant unnecessary, because the
DEA agent was not present when the container was resealed at the airport by the customs officers and the container was out of sight while it
was in respondent's apartment.
Held: The warrantless reopening of the container following its reseizure did not violate respondent's rights under the Fourth Amendment.

government officers lawfully (as here) have opened that container and

an investigation into illicit drug traffic make "perfect" controlled deliveries frequently impossible to attain. The likelihood that contraband may
be removed or other items may be placed inside the container during a
gap in surveillance depends on all the facts and circumstances, including
the nature and uses of the container, the length of the break in surveillance, and the setting in which the events occur. A workable, objective
standard that limits the risk of intrusion on legitimate privacy interests
when there has been an interruption of surveillance is whether there is
a substantial likelihood that the contents of the container have been
changed during the gap in surveillance. Pp. 769-773.
(b) There was no substantial likelihood here that the contents of the
shipping container were changed during the brief period that it was
out of sight of the surveilling officer. Thus, reopening the container did
not intrude on any legitimate expectation of privacy and did not violate
the Fourth Amendment. P. 773.

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS
765

Opinion of the Court

I
A large, locked metal container was shipped by air from
Calcutta to respondent in Chicago. When the container
arrived at O'Hare International Airport, a customs inspector
opened it and found a wooden table approximately three feet
in diameter and 8 to 10 inches thick. Marihuana was found
concealed inside the table.
The customs inspector informed the Drug Enforcement
Administration of these facts and Special Agent Labek came
to the airport later that day. Labek chemically tested the
substance contained in the table, confirming that it was
marihuana. The table and the container were resealed.
The next day, Labek put the container in a delivery van
and drove to respondent's building. He was met there by
Chicago Police Inspector Lipsek. Posing as delivery men,
Labek and Lipsek entered the apartment building and
announced they had a package for respondent. Respondent
came to the lobby and identified himself. In response to
Lipsek's comment about the weight of the package, respondent answered that it "wasn't that heavy; that he had packaged
it himself, that it only contained a table." App. 14.
At respondent's request, the officers making the delivery
left the container in the hallway outside respondent's apartment. Labek stationed himself to keep the container in
sight and observed respondent pull the container into his
apartment. When Lipsek left to secure a warrant to enter
and search respondent's apartment, Labek maintained surveillance of the apartment; he saw respondent leave his
apartment, walk to the end of the corridor, look out the window, and then return to the apartment. Labek remained in
the building but did not keep the apartment door under
constant surveillance.
Between 30 and 45 minutes after the delivery, but before
Lipsek could return with a warrant, respondent reemerged
from the apartment with the shipping container and was immediately arrested by Labek and taken to the police station.
There, the officers reopened the container and seized the

marihuana found inside the table. No search warrant had
been obtained.
Respondent was charged with two counts of possession of
704(e) and
controlled substances. Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 56 Y2,
705(e) (1981). Prior to trial, the trial court granted respondent's motion to suppress the marihuana found in the table,
relying on Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 (1979), and
United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).
On appeal, the Appellate Court of Illinois, First Judicial
District, affirmed. 100 Ill. App. 3d 396, 426 N. E. 2d 1078
(1981). It relied primarily on Sanders and Chadwick in holding that respondent had a legitimate expectation of privacy in
the contents of the shipping container. 100 Ill. App. 3d, at
399-401, 426 N. E. 2d, at 1080-1082. It recognized that no
warrant would be necessary if the police had made a "controlled delivery" of the container following a lawful search,
but held that here the police had failed to make a "controlled
delivery."
A "controlled delivery," in the view of the Illinois court,
requires that the police maintain "dominion and control" over
the container at all times; only by constant control, in that
court's view, can police be "absolutely sure" that its contents
have not changed since the initial search. Id., at 402, 426
N. E. 2d, at 1082. Here, according to the court, the police
could not have been "absolutely sure" of the container's contents for two reasons: (1) Labek was not present when the
container was resealed by the customs officers, and thus he
knew of its contents only by "hearsay," ibid., 426 N. E. 2d, at
1083, and (2) the container was out of sight for the 30 to 45
minutes while it was in respondent's apartment; thus, in the
court's view, "there is no certainty that the contents of the
package were the same before and after the package was
brought into [respondent's] apartment." Ibid. Accordingly, the Illinois court held that the warrantless reopening
of the container violated the Fourth Amendment.

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS
765

Opinion of the Court

We granted certiorari, 459 U. S. 904 (1982), and we

reverse.
II
The lawful discovery by common carriers or customs officers of contraband in transit' presents law enforcement

authorities 2 with an opportunity to identify and prosecute the
person or persons responsible for the movement of the con-

traband.

To accomplish this, the police, rather than simply

seizing the contraband and destroying it, make a so-called

controlled delivery of the container to its consignee, allowing
the container to continue its journey to the destination
contemplated by the parties.

The person dealing in the

contraband can then be identified upon taking possession
of and asserting dominion over the container.
ICommon carriers have a common-law right to inspect packages they accept for shipment, based on their duty to refrain from carrying contraband.
See United States v. Pryba, 163 U. S. App. D. C. 389, 397-398, 502 F. 2d
391, 399-400 (1974). Although sheer volume prevents systematic inspection of all or even a large percentage of the cargo in their care, see, e. g.,
McConnell v. State, 595 P. 2d 147, 148, and n. 1 (Alaska 1979), carriers do
discover contraband in a variety of circumstances. Similarly, although the
United States Government has the undoubted right to inspect all incoming
goods at a port of entry, see United States v. Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606,
616-619 (1977), it would be impossible for customs officers to inspect every
package. In the course of selective inspections, they inevitably discover
contraband in transit.
'When common carriers discover contraband in packages entrusted to
their care, it is routine for them to notify the appropriate authorities. The
arrival of police on the scene to confirm the presence of contraband and to
determine what to do with it does not convert the private search by the
carrier into a government search subject to the Fourth Amendment.
E. g., United States v. Edwards, 602 F. 2d 458 (CA1 1979).
1Of course, the mere fact that the consignee takes possession of the container would not alone establish guilt of illegal possession or importation of
contraband. The recipient of the package would be free to offer evidence
that the nature of the contents were unknown to him; the nature of the
contents and the recipient's awareness of them would be issues for the factfinder.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

463 U. S.

The typical pattern of a controlled delivery was well described by one court:
"Controlled deliveries of contraband apparently serve
a useful function in law enforcement. They most ordinarily occur when a carrier, usually an airline, unexpectedly discovers what seems to be contraband while
inspecting luggage to learn the identity of its owner, or
when the contraband falls out of a broken or damaged
piece of luggage, or when the carrier exercises its
inspection privilege because some suspicious circumstance has caused it concern that it may unwittingly be
transporting contraband. Frequently, after such a discovery, law enforcement agents restore the contraband
to its container, then close or reseal the container, and
authorize the carrier to deliver the container to its
owner. When the owner appears to take delivery he is
arrested and the container with the contraband is seized
and then searched a second time for the contraband
known to be there." United States v. Bulgier, 618 F. 2d
472, 476 (CA7), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 843 (1980).
See also McConnell v. State, 595 P. 2d 147 (Alaska 1979).
Here, a customs agent lawfully discovered drugs concealed
in a container and notified the appropriate law enforcement
authorities. They took steps to arrange delivery of the
container to respondent. A short time after delivering the
container, the officers arrested respondent and reseized the
container. 4 Respondent claims, and the Illinois court held,
that the warrantless reopening of the container following its
reseizure violated respondent's right under the Fourth
Amendment "to be secure ... against unreasonable searches
and seizures . . . ." We disagree.
'Respondent has not claimed that the warrantless seizure of the container from the hallway of his apartment house following his arrest violated
the Fourth Amendment; his claim goes only to the warrantless reopening
of the container.

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS
765

Opinion of the Court

The Fourth Amendment protects legitimate expectations
of privacy rather than simply places. If the inspection by
police does not intrude upon a legitimate expectation of privacy, there is no "search" subject to the Warrant Clause.
See Walter v. United States, 447 U. S. 649, 663-665 (1980)
(BLACKMUN, J., dissenting). The threshold question, then,
is whether an individual has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a previously lawfully searched container. It is obvious that the privacy interest in the contents
of a container diminishes with respect to a container that law
enforcement authorities have already lawfully opened and
found to contain illicit drugs. No protected privacy interest
remains in contraband in a container once government officers lawfully have opened that container and identified its
contents as illegal. The simple act of resealing the container
to enable the police to make a controlled delivery does not operate to revive or restore the lawfully invaded privacy rights.
This conclusion is supported by the reasoning underlying
the "plain-view" doctrine. The plain-view doctrine authorizes seizure of illegal or evidentiary items visible to a police
officer whose access to the object has some prior Fourth
Amendment justification and who has probable cause to suspect that the item is connected with criminal activity. Texas
v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730, 738, and n. 4, 741-742 (1983) (plurality opinion); id., at 746 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at 748, 749-750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
The plain-view doctrine is grounded on the proposition that
once police are lawfully in a position to observe an item firsthand, its owner's privacy interest in that item is lost; the
owner may retain the incidents of title and possession but not
privacy. That rationale applies here; once a container has
been found to a certainty to contain illicit drugs,' the contra5

The Illinois Court held that Labek's absence when the container was
resealed by customs officers somehow made less than certain his knowledge of the container's contents. This was plain error: where law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation, as here, the knowl-

band becomes like objects physically within the plain view of
the police, and the claim to privacy is lost. Consequently,
the subsequent reopening of the container is not a "search"
within the intendment of the Fourth Amendment.
However, the rigors and contingencies inescapable in an
investigation into illicit drug traffic often make "perfect"
controlled deliveries and the "absolute certainty" demanded
by the Illinois court impossible to attain. Conducting such a
surveillance undetected is likely to render it virtually impossible for police so perfectly to time their movements as to
avoid detection and also be able to arrest the owner and
reseize the container the instant he takes possession. Not
infrequently, police may lose sight of the container they are
trailing, as is the risk in the pursuit of a car or vessel.
During such a gap in surveillance, it is possible that the
container will be put to other uses-for example, the contraband may be removed or other items may be placed inside.
The likelihood that this will happen depends on all the facts
and circumstances, including the nature and uses of the container, the length of the break in surveillance, and the setting
in which the events occur. However, the mere fact that the
police may be less than 100% certain of the contents of the
container is insufficient to create a protected interest in
the privacy of the container. See Arkansas v. Sanders, 442
U. S., at 764-765, n. 13. The issue then becomes at what
point after an interruption of control or surveillance, courts
should recognize the individual's expectation of privacy in
the container as a legitimate right protected by the Fourth
Amendment proscription against unreasonable searches.
In fashioning a standard, we must be mindful of three
Fourth Amendment principles. First, the standard should
be workable for application by rank-and-file, trained police
officers. See New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 458-460
(1981); United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 821 (1982).
edge of one is presumed shared by all. See Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U. S.
560, 568 (1971).

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS

765

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

Second, it should be reasonable; for example, it would be
absurd to recognize as legitimate an expectation of privacy
where there is only a minimal probability that the contents of
a particular container had been changed. Third, the standard should be objective, not dependent on the belief of individual police officers. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 21-22
(1968). A workable, objective standard that limits the risk
of intrusion on legitimate privacy interests is whether there
is a substantial likelihood that the contents of the container
have been changed during the gap in surveillance. We hold
that absent a substantial likelihood that the contents have
been changed, there is no legitimate expectation of privacy in
the contents of a container previously opened under lawful
authority.
III

Applying these principles, we conclude there was no
substantial likelihood here that the contents of the shipping
container were changed during the brief period that it was out
of sight of the surveilling officer. The unusual size of the container, its specialized purpose, and the relatively short break
in surveillance combine to make it substantially unlikely that
the respondent removed the table or placed new items inside
the container while it was in his apartment. Thus, reopening
the container did not intrude on any legitimate expectation of
privacy and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.
The judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins,
dissenting.
The underlying question in this case is very simple:
whether a second search after a prior legal search and a
"controlled delivery" will ordinarily require a warrant. The
Court answers that question by announcing that the second
search is not a search at all, but merely a "reopening," ante,

at 772, not subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment. I suppose one should be grateful that the Court has
not explicitly opened one more breach in the general rule that
""'searches conducted outside the judicial process, without
prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment-subject only to a few
specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.""'
United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 825 (1982), quoting
Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978), in turn quoting
Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967). 1 On the
other hand, the Court's rationale, even though limited to
a very specific fact pattern, is nevertheless astounding in
its implications. We have, to my knowledge, never held
that the physical opening and examination of a container in
the possession of an individual was anything other than a
"search." It might be a permissible search or an impermissible search, require a warrant or not require a warrant, but it
2
is in any event a "search."

I

A
The Court's primary argument in favor of its "no-search"
holding can be stated briefly:
"The threshold question.., is whether an individual has
a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a
'See also, e. g., Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753, 759 (1979); G. M.
Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U. S. 338, 358 (1977); United States v.
United States District Court, 407 U. S. 297, 318 (1972); Camarav. Municipal Court, 387 U. S. 523, 528-529 (1967); Jones v. United States, 357 U. S.
493, 499 (1958).
1Indeed, if the "reopening" of a package in a controlled delivery context
is not a "search," it is not even clear why it should require probable cause.
Fortunately, though, the Court seems to reject this implication of its reasoning. See ante, at 771 ("No protected privacy interest remains in contraband in a container once government officials lawfully have opened that
container and identified its contents as illegal"); ante, at 771-772 ("once a
container has been found to a certainty to contain illicit drugs, the contraband becomes like objects physically within the plain view of the police,
and the claim to privacy is lost") (footnote omitted).

ILLINOIS v. ANDREAS

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

previously lawfully searched container. It is obvious
that the privacy interest in the contents of a container
diminishes with respect to a container that law enforcement authorities have already lawfully opened and found
to contain illicit drugs. No protected privacy interest
remains in contraband in a container once government
officers lawfully have opened that container and identified its contents as illegal. The simple act of sealing the
container to enable the police to make a controlled delivery does not operate to revive or restore the lawfully
invaded privacy rights." Ante, at 771.
The validity of this reasoning depends, however, on what
the Court means by "protected privacy interest." Clearly,
one aspect of the privacy interest protected by the Fourth
Amendment is the right to keep certain information beyond
official scrutiny. See United States v. Knotts, 460 U. S. 276,
281-282 (1983) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in location of automobile on public roads). If this were all that
were meant by the notion of privacy embodied in the Fourth
Amendment, the Court's analysis would be essentially correct. Respondent knowingly and voluntarily rendered his
container vulnerable to a perfectly legal and perfectly proper
border search. And as soon as that search revealed the
presence of contraband, any reasonable expectation respondent may have had that the existence of the contraband would
remain secret was lost, and could not be regained.
The Fourth Amendment, however, does not protect only
information. It also protects, in its own sometimes-forgotten words, "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects..." (emphasis added). As
Justice Brandeis put the matter in his dissent in Olmstead v.
United States, 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928), the Fourth Amendment "conferred, as against the Government, the right to be
let alone-the most comprehensive of rights and the right
most valued by civilized men" (emphasis added). The right
to be "let alone" is, at the very least, the right not to have
one's repose and possessions disturbed. See, e. g., Rakas v.

Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 626-630 (1886).1 In
this case, respondent had the right to maintain the integrity

of his container.

Admittedly, he waived that right tempo-

rarily when the container passed through customs inspection;
as Carrollv. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), teaches us,

the right of the Government to search, with or without probable cause, persons and property entering the country is
necessary to "national self protection."

Id., at 154.

But

however justified the search at customs may have been, that
justification no longer existed once the container was sent on
its way, and certainly did not exist once the container was
delivered to respondent.
That the Court's reduction of the right to privacy to the

right to secrecy is incorrect, and that its implicit analogy between a border search and a loss of amateur status is inapt, is
made quite clear by a number of our recent cases.4 In Lo-Ji
ISee generally Posner, The Uncertain Protection of Privacy by the
Supreme Court, 1979 S. Ct. Rev. 173 (discussing "seclusion" and "secrecy"
aspects of privacy right protected by the Fourth Amendment); cf. Whalen
v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599, nn. 24-25 (1977).
'The Court's confusion may be in part an unintended consequence of
our decision in Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967), where we held
that electronic eavesdropping was subject to the warrant requirement
even if it involved no physical intrusion into a suspect's "protected area."
Before Katz, this Court may have focused too much on the "security"
aspect of the right of privacy, while giving short shrift to its "secrecy"
aspect. In recognizing the importance of secrecy, however, Katz did not
extinguish the relevance of security. As I wrote only recently, Katz
"made quite clear that the Fourth Amendment protects against governmental invasions of a person's reasonable 'expectation[s] of privacy,' even
when those invasions are not accompanied by physical intrusions. Cases
such as Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S.505, 509-512 (1961), how-

Sales, Inc. v. New York, 442 U. S. 319 (1979), for example,
we reviewed the warrantless search of an "adult bookstore"
by local law enforcement officials. THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
speaking for a unanimous Court, stated:
"The suggestion is [made] that by virtue of its display of
the items at issue to the general public in areas of its
store open to them, petitioner had no legitimate expectation of privacy against governmental intrusion, see
Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128 (1978), and that accordingly no warrant was needed. But there is no basis for
the notion that because a retail store invites the public to
enter, it consents to wholesale searches and seizures that
do not conform to Fourth Amendment guarantees. See
Lewis v. United States, 385 U. S. 206, 211 (1966)." Id.,
at 329.
Cf. Walter v. United States, 447 U. S. 649, 660-662 (1980)
(WHITE, J., concurring in judgment). Similarly, in Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U. S. 499 (1978), we held that, although a
building fire and its immediate aftermath are "exigent circumstances" justifying the warrantless entry of the building
both by firefighters and by investigators, any further intrusions that take place after the exigent circumstances have
passed require a warrant. The fire may suspend the right to
be let alone, but it does not extinguish it, and an initial search
does not validate the legality of subsequent independent
warrantless searches, let alone render them nonsearches.

ever, hold that, when the Government does engage in physical intrusion of

a constitutionally protected area in order to obtain information, that intrusion may constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment even if the same
information could have been obtained by other means. I do not believe
that Katz, or its progeny, have eroded that principle." United States v.

Thus, in its analysis today, the Court breaks new ground
and erodes the principles of the Fourth Amendment. Moreover, by claiming that the right to "title and possession" confers no right to "privacy," ante, at 771, the Court adopts a
view curiously out of touch with the genius of the American
system of liberties.

B
The Court supports its "no-search" analysis by an analogy to the "reasoning underlying the 'plain-view' doctrine."
Ibid. In fact, however, the "plain-view" doctrine hurts
rather than helps the Court's case, for it recognizes and
indeed emphasizes that the Fourth Amendment protects
security as well as secrecy.
"We recognized in Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573,
587 (1980), the well-settled rule that 'objects such as
weapons or contraband found in a public place may be
seized by the police without a warrant. The seizure of
property in plain view involves no invasion of privacy
and is presumptively reasonable, assuming that there is
probable cause to associate the property with criminal
activity.' A different situation is presented, however,
when the property in open view is 'situated on private
premises to which access is not otherwise available for
the seizing officer.' Ibid., quoting G. M. Leasing Corp.
v. United States, 429 U. S. 338, 354 (1977). As these
cases indicate, 'plain view' provides grounds for seizure
of an item when an officer's access to an object has some
prior justification under the Fourth Amendment. 'Plain
view' is perhaps better understood, therefore, not as
an independent 'exception' to the Warrant Clause, but
simply as an extension of whatever the prior justification
for an officer's 'access to an object' may be." Texas v.

(plurality opinion). Thus, under the "plain-view" doctrine,
the fact that a person displays incriminating evidence in his
living room window 5 (or allows it to pass through customs inspection) is not enough by itself to authorize a search and seizure of that evidence. More is necessary, and that "more"
must be some independent reason for breaching the individual's right to repose and to security in his possessions.
Moreover, as the Court itself admits, "plain view" can only
justify a search or seizure of an item if the authorities have
"probable cause to suspect that the item is connected with
criminal activity." Ante, at 771. Obviously, there would
be no need to require probable cause if the protections of
the Fourth Amendment did not apply at all to the search or
seizure in question. Cf. n. 2, supra.

C
The plain-view doctrine does, of course, highlight the
fact that there are certain "specifically established and welldelineated exceptions" to the Fourth Amendment's warrant
requirement. See supra, at 774. Such exceptions, however, require at the very least that there be some compelling
government interest at stake, not merely in the search at
issue, but in the right to conduct the search without a warrant.6 Moreover, we have repeatedly made clear that "the
police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial
approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure." Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 20 (1968). See United
States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1, 13 (1977); United States v.
United States District Court, 407 U. S., at 315-318; Chimel
v. California, 395 U. S. 752, 762 (1969); Johnson v. United
'Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S., at 468, and n. 25 (plurality
opinion); Taylor v. United States, 286 U. S. 1 (1932).
1"In assessing whether the public interest demands creation of a
general exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement the
question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in
question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a
warrant .... ." Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U. S., at 533.

States, 333 U. S. 10, 15 (1948); Carroll v. United States, 267
U. S., at 153. Indeed, each of the limited exceptions we
have established to the warrant requirement arose in a context in which, at the very least, a warrantless search was
necessary to preserve the safety of law enforcement officers,
see, e. g., Chimel v. California, supra (search incident to
arrest), or to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence,
see, e. g., Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 48-51 (1970)
(automobile exception), or in which the very special nature
of the government interest made it appropriate to allow a
search based on something less than probable cause, see, e. g.,
Carrollv. United States, supra,at 154 (border search). In the
plain-view context, the compelling government interest is
evident: the legal search has already put potential suspects on
notice that they are the objects of official interest; the delay
inherent in obtaining a warrant at that point might risk the
destruction of the evidence and even the security of the officers. See Coolidge, supra, at 467-468 (plurality opinion).
This case, however, presents none of the conditions that we
have previously held indispensable to the recognition of an
exception to the warrant requirement. The police officers
who conducted the search of respondent's container could
have obtained, were indeed in the process of obtaining, a
search warrant, but decided instead-for no apparent reason
other than the hope of vindication in this Court-to conduct
the search without a warrant. Thus, even if one were to
recharacterize the Court's novel "no-search" analysis as
simply another exception to the warrant requirement, it
would be difficult to square that result with the clear mandate
of our previous decisions.
I agree entirely with the Court that "controlled delivery" is
a proper and effective tool of responsible law enforcement.
See ante, at 769-770. If contraband is discovered in a package passing through customs inspection, the authorities are
not required to seize it then and there, but may make use of
their discovery to obtain more evidence and to capture the culprits behind the contraband. The "controlled delivery" tech-

J., dissenting

nique, however, would be just as effective, and decidedly
more proper, if the second search that came at its culmination were authorized by a valid search warrant. Under
these circumstances, I am not at all sure what interest the
Court thinks it is vindicating by its determined if awkward
exertions.
I

Even if the Court were correct that the "reopening" of
a package after a properly controlled "controlled delivery"
is not a "search," I could still not agree with the standard
it fashions to put that principle into effect, or with the result
it reaches in this case. The Court holds that a "reopening" is
not a "search" as long as there is not a "substantial likelihood
that the contents of the container have been changed during
[a] gap in surveillance." Ante, at 773. Of course, "the rigors
and contingencies inescapable in an investigation into illicit
drug traffic often make 'perfect' controlled deliveries and
.. 'absolute certainty'... impossible," ante, at 772. Nevertheless, the very justifications proffered by the Court for
its "no-search" analysis should have at least led it to require
something very close to "absolute certainty." Cf. post,
p. 782 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). After all, if a person has
no reasonable expectation of privacy in a package whose contents are already legally known to the authorities, a reasonable expectation of privacy should reattach if the person has
unobserved access to the package and any opportunity to
change its contents. By adopting a vague intermediate
standard, the Court makes more likely serious intrusions into
what even it would consider to be "reasonable expectations of
privacy." Moreover, I cannot see how as indistinct a phrase
as "substantial likelihood" could in any way serve the Court's
interest in fashioning a standard "workable for application by
rank-and-file, trained police officers." Ante, at 772.
In this case, the package subject to a "controlled delivery"
was in respondent's possession for between 30 and 45 minutes. For a good deal of that time, it was unobserved. I am
by no means convinced that there was, as an ex ante matter,

even a "substantial likelihood" that the container still contained contraband when it was searched, or "reopened." In
any event, I fail to see how, in light of the very justifications
put forward by the Court for a "controlled delivery" gloss on
the Fourth Amendment, a warrantless search can be justified
here as in any way consistent with the principles embodied in
that Amendment.

dissenting.
The issue in this case is remarkably similar to the controlling issue in Texas v. Brown, 460 U. S. 730 (1983): Was
there "virtual certainty" that the police would find contraband inside an unusual container that they had lawfully
seized? The unique character of the balloon in Brown, like
the unique character of the metal case enclosing a table that
in turn had been designed to conceal drugs, combined with
other circumstantial evidence, provided powerful evidentiary
support for the conclusion that contraband was inside the
container. In this case, as in Brown, I believe the "absolute
certainty" test applied by the state court was somewhat more
strict than is required by the Fourth Amendment to the
United States Constitution. I would therefore vacate the
judgment of the Illinois Appellate Court and remand for
further proceedings.*
JUSTICE STEVENS,

*If I were sitting as a trial judge, and actually had heard the evidence, I
believe I would have found that there was virtual certainty that the police
officers were correct in both cases. But, unlike my colleagues, I do not
believe it is this Court's province to make such factual determinations.
