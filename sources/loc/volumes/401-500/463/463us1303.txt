CAPITAL CITIES MEDIA, INC., ET AL. v. TOOLE,
JUDGE OF THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF
LUZERNE COUNTY
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-1070.

Decided July 13, 1983

An application to stay respondent Pennsylvania trial court judge's order is
granted insofar as it prohibits publication of the names or addresses of
jurors who served in a homicide trial. The order, which was entered
after the jurors had been selected in open voir dire proceedings at which
their names were not kept confidential, is not restricted to the time during which the trial was conducted, but on its face permanently prohibits publishing the jurors' names or addresses. The jury ultimately
returned a guilty verdict and was discharged. If the Pennsylvania
Supreme Court, which denied an application for summary relief, were to
sustain the order on its merits, four Justices of this Court would probably vote to grant review, and there would be a substantial prospect of
reversal. However, the application is denied insofar as it seeks a stay of
the order's prohibition of the sketching, photographing, televising, or
videotaping of any of the jurors "during their service in these proceedings." Since the jury has been discharged, this provision of the order
can no longer have effect, and there is no prospect of immediate injury to
applicants before they can seek appellate review of the order. The
application is also denied without prejudice to its renewal insofar as it
seeks a stay of another order of the trial judge restricting access to exhibits, since applicants have neither identified the exhibits to which they
seek access nor indicated that they have sought an order from the trial
judge permitting them access.

Circuit Justice.
This is an application for an immediate stay of several
orders entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne
County, Pa., in connection with a homicide trial in that court,
Commonwealth v. Banks, Criminal Cases Nos. 1290, 1506,
1507, 1508, 1519, 1520, 1524 of 1982, that had attracted a
great deal of public interest. The specific orders in question
were entered by respondent Judge Toole on June 3, 1983,
after selection of the trial jury but before its sequestration.
JUSTICE BRENNAN,

In one order, respondent directed first that "[n]o person shall
print or announce in any way the names or addresses of any
juror," Order in Accordance with Pa. Rule Crim. Proc.
1111(c), June 3, 1983, 2 (hereinafter 2), and also that "[n]o
person shall draw sketches, photographs, televise or videotape any juror or jurors during their service in these proceedings... ," 6 (hereinafter 6). In a separate order, Judge
Toole ordered that "In]o one, except attorneys of record,
their agents, court personnel, witnesses and jurors may
handle exhibits except by Order of Court," Order Pursuant
to Pa. Rule Crim. Proc. 326, June 3, 1983, 11 (hereinafter
11). The application for a stay was first presented to me on
June 18, 1983, but I held it pending action by the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania on a substantially identical application
for summary relief. On June 21, the jury returned a guilty
verdict in the Banks case and was discharged; on June 30, the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied summary relief. Applicants immediately reapplied to me for a stay. An initial
response was received by telegram on July 7, with a more
complete response submitted on July 13.
In recent years, several Justices have had occasion to
explain the role of a Circuit Justice in precisely this context,
when a trial court has enjoined the press and other media
from publication of information in connection with a criminal
trial. Caution is the refrain of any Justice acting as Circuit
Justice, but we have recognized the special importance of
swift action to guard against the threat to First Amendment
values posed by prior restraints. It is clear that even a
short-lived "gag" order in a case of widespread concern to
the community constitutes a substantial prior restraint and
causes irreparable injury to First Amendment interests as
long as it remains in effect. When it appears that there is
a significant possibility that this Court would grant plenary
review and reverse the lower court's decision, at least in
part, a stay may issue. NebraskaPressAssn. v. Stuart, 423
U. S. 1327, 1330 (1975) (BLACKMUN, Circuit Justice); TimesPicayune Publishing Corp. v. Schulingkamp, 419 U. S.

1301, 1305 (1974) (POWELL, Circuit Justice). See also
Bonura v. CBS, Inc., 459 U. S. 1313 (1983) (WHITE, Circuit
Justice).
I address first the 2 provision, which on its face permanently restrains publication of the names or addresses of any
juror. Counsel for respondent has informed the Clerk of
this Court that this order remains in effect, and that publication at this time of the name of a juror would subject the publisher to the possibility of being held in contempt of court.
This order was entered by the court sua sponte and without
a hearing or a record; neither the prosecution nor defendant has expressed any interest in it. Cf. Gannett Co. v.
DePasquale,443 U. S.368 (1979). The jury was selected at
voir dire proceedings begun prior to the issuance of this
order, from which the press and public were not excluded,
and at which the names of the prospective jurors were not
kept confidential. Cf. Press-EnterpriseCo. v. Superior
Court of California, 4 Civil No. 27904 (Ct. App. Cal., 4th
App. Dist., May 13, 1982), cert. granted, 459 U. S. 1169
(1983).
It hardly requires repetition that "'[any system of prior
restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing a heavy
presumption against its constitutional validity,"' and that the
State "'carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the
imposition of such a restraint."' New York Times Co. v.
United States, 403 U. S.713, 714 (1971) (percuriam). This
Court has given plenary consideration to a number of state
statutes and court orders issued thereunder restraining
publication of information in connection with a criminal trial
or restricting press access to a criminal trial for the purpose
of preventing such publication. Just last Term, in Globe
Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U. S.596 (1982), we
held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments prohibited
enforcement of a rule barring press and public access to criminal sex-offense trials during the testimony of minor victims.
We adopted a familiar standard: "Where, as in the present
case, the State attempts ...to inhibit the disclosure of sensi-

tive information, it must be shown that the denial is necessitated by a compelling governmental interest, and is narrowly
tailored to serve that interest." Id., at 606-607; cf. Smith v.
Daily Mail PublishingCo., 443 U. S. 97 (1979).
I assume, for purposes of argument only, that the State
has a compelling interest in keeping personal information
about jurors confidential in an appropriate case, either to
assure the defendant a fair trial or to protect the privacy
of jurors. Cf. Globe Newspaper, supra, at 607; Richmond
Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U. S. 555, 600 (1980)
(Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). Our precedents
make clear, however, that far more justification than appears
on this record would be necessary to show that this categorical, permanent prohibition against publishing information already in the public record was "narrowly tailored to serve
that interest," if indeed any justification would suffice to
sustain a permanent order. Based on these precedents, I
must conclude that if the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
sustained this order on its merits, four Justices of this Court
would vote to grant review, and there would be a substantial
prospect of reversal.
Insofar as the State's interest is in shielding jurors from
pressure during the course of the trial, so as to ensure the
defendant a fair trial, that interest becomes attenuated after
the jury brings in its verdict and is discharged. Cf. Gannett
Co. v. DePasquale,supra, at 400 (POWELL, J., concurring).
As for the State's concern for the jurors' privacy, we have not
permitted restrictions on the publication of information that
would have been available to any member of the public who
attended an open proceeding in a criminal trial, Oklahoma
Publishing Co. v. District Court, 430 U. S. 308, 311-312
(1977) (per curiam); Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427
U. S. 539, 568 (1976), even for the obviously sympathetic
purpose of protecting the privacy of rape victims, Globe
Newspaper, supra, at 607-609; Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.
Cohn, 420 U. S. 469, 491-495 (1975). See also Smith v.

Opinion in Chambers

Daily Mail PublishingCo., supra,at 104: "Ifthe information
is lawfully obtained... the state may not punish its publication except when necessary to further an interest more substantial than is present here"--i. e., protecting the privacy of
an 11-year-old boy charged with a juvenile offense. In an
extraordinary case such a restriction might be justified, but
the justifications must be adduced on a case-by-case basis,
with all interested parties given the opportunity to participate, and less restrictive alternatives must be adopted if
feasible. Globe Newspaper, supra, at 608-609, and n. 25;
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, supra, at 580-581
(opinion of BURGER, C. J.); Landmark Communications,
Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 842-843 (1978). The 12
order was entered without a hearing, and without findings
of fact that would justify it; respondent has suggested no
concern specific to this case in support of his order. Accordingly, I grant applicants' request for a stay of the 2
provision.
It would be inappropriate for me to grant a stay of the 6
or 11 provisions. By its terms, the 6 provision applied
only "during [the jurors'] service in these proceedings."
Since the jury has been discharged, this particular provision
can no longer have effect. It may be that such an order,
although it had expired, could still receive appellate review
in this Court under the "capable of repetition, yet evading
review" doctrine, see Nebraska Press Assn., 427 U. S., at
546-547, but there is no prospect of immediate injury to
applicants before they can seek review of the order, so their
application for a stay must be denied. As for the 11 provision, restricting access to exhibits, applicants have neither
identified the exhibits to which they seek access, nor have
they indicated that they have sought a court order permitting
them access. The application for a stay of the 11 provision
is denied without prejudice to its renewal in the event a
request for access to exhibits is denied by the trial judge.
I shall issue an order accordingly.
