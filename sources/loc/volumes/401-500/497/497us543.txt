ALVARADO v. UNITED STATES
Per Curiam

ALVARADO v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
No. 89-6985.

Decided June 25, 1990

Petitioner Alvarado claimed at his criminal trial that the Government used
peremptory challenges to remove black jurors solely because of race,
contrary to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79. The District Court accepted the Government's explanations for its challenges, and Alvarado
was convicted. In affirming the conviction, the Court of Appeals did
not rule on Alvarado's argument that the Government's explanations
were pretextual or the Government's arguments that he had not made
out a prima facie Batson error and that it had race-neutral reasons for
the challenges. The court held instead that no appellate inquiry was required into the merits of a Batson claim if the jury finally chosen represented a fair cross section of the community.
Held: The case is remanded for the Court of Appeals to pass on the adequacy of the Government's reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges. The Government agrees that the Court of Appeals' judgment
rests on an improvident ground. Thus, it is appropriate for this Court
to grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and direct reconsideration in light of the representations made by the United States in this
Court. See, e. g., Biddle v. United States, 484 U. S. 1054. This result
is not unusual even when, as here, the Government has suggested that
there is another ground on which the decision below could be affirmed if
the case were brought in this Court.
Certiorari granted; 891 F. 2d 439, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

At his criminal trial, petitioner claimed that the Government used certain peremptory challenges to remove black jurors solely on the grounds of race, contrary to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986). The District Court accepted the
Government's explanations for its challenges, and petitioner
was convicted. He pursued his Batson claim in the Court of
Appeals, claiming that the Government's explanations were
pretextual. The Government asserted that petitioner had

not made out a prima facie Batson error and that it had raceneutral reasons for each challenge. The Court of Appeals
did not rule on these competing claims, for it held that no
appellate inquiry was required into the merits of a Batson
claim if the jury finally chosen represented a fair cross section of the community, as did this jury. The conviction was
affirmed.
Petitioner, seeking certiorari, urges that the Court of Appeals relied on an erroneous ground in rejecting the Batson
claim. The United States agrees that the Court of Appeals
erred in holding that as long as the petit jury chosen satisfied
the Sixth Amendment's fair-cross-section concept, it need not
inquire into the claim that the prosecution had stricken jurors
on purely racial grounds. That holding, the Government
states, is contrary to Batson and is also discredited by our
decision in Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474 (1990), which
held that the fair-cross-section requirement of the Sixth
Amendment did not apply to the petit jury and which was
handed down after the Court of Appeals issued its opinion
below. The Government urges us to deny certiorari, however, because petitioner failed to make out a prima facie case
of intentional discrimination and because the reasons given
for the challenges were race-neutral grounds for decision that
the Court of Appeals did not reach.
When the Government has suggested that an error has
been made by the court below, it is not unusual for us to
grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and direct reconsideration in light of the representations made by the
United States in this Court. See, e. g., Biddle v. United
States, 484 U. S. 1054 (1988); Malone v. United States, 484
U. S. 919 (1987). Nor is it novel to do so in a case where
error is conceded but it is suggested that there is another
ground on which the decision below could be affirmed if the
case were brought here. Indeed, a case decided earlier this
Term presented such a situation and, without dissent, we vacated the judgment below for reconsideration in light of the

position asserted by the Government in this Court. Chappell v. United States, 494 U. S. 1075 (1990).
This is the
appropriate course to follow in this case. If the judgment
below rested on an improvident ground, as the Government
suggests, the Court of Appeals should in the first instance
pass on the adequacy of the Government's reasons for exercising its peremptory challenges.
Consequently, the motion of petitioner for leave to proceed
informa pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are
granted. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Government in its brief filed May 21, 1990.
It is so ordered.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY join,

dissenting.
I have previously expressed my doubt as to the wisdom of
automatically vacating a Court of Appeals judgment favorable to the Government when the Government confesses
error in this Court. See Mariscal v. United States, 449
U. S. 405, 406 (1981) (dissenting opinion). Today the Court
carries this unfortunate practice to new lengths: The Government has not confessed error in this case, but instead has
taken the position that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
was correct and that certiorari should be denied.
The Government's brief in opposition contains the following statement:
"Although petitioner's Batson claim lacks merit, we
agree with petitioner that the court of appeals' analysis
departed from the general approach to discrimination in
jury selection that this Court marked out in Batson."
Brief in Opposition 12.
The Court seizes upon this concession that the "analysis" of
the Court of Appeals may have been wrong as a justification

for vacating the judgment. But the entire thrust of the Government's brief is that the result reached by the Court of Appeals was correct.
A confession of error is at least a deliberate decision on the
part of the Government to concede that a Court of Appeals
judgment in favor of the Government was wrong. In the
present case, however, we have only the above-quoted statement of the Government in its brief opposing a grant of certiorari. If we are now to vacate judgments on the basis of
what are essentially observations in the Government's brief
about the "approach" of the Court of Appeals in a particular
case, I fear we may find the Government's future briefs in opposition much less explicit and frank than they have been in
the past. Since we depend heavily on the Government in deciding whether to grant certiorari in cases in which the Government is a party, the Court will be the loser as a result.
