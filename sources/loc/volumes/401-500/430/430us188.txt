v. UNITED STATES

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE
SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 75-708.

Argued November 1-2, 1976-Decided March 1, 1977

Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in violation
of a federal statute. The conduct that gave rise to the charge occurred
before Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, was decided, announcing new
standards for "isolat[ing] 'hard core' pornography from expression protected by the First Amendment," id., at 29. Held: The Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to
petitioners of the Miller standards, to the extent that those standards
may impose criminal liability for conduct not punishable under the
standards announced in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U. S. 413.
Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347. Specifically, petitioners are
entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless it finds
that the materials involved are "utterly without redeeming social
value." At the same time, any constitutional principle announced in
Miller that would serve to benefit petitioners must be applied in their
case. Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 102. Pp. 189-197.

(1973), are to be applied retroactively to the potential detriment of a defendant in a criminal case. We granted certiorari, 424 U. S. 942 (1976), to resolve a conflict in the

I
Petitioners were charged with several counts of transporting obscene materials in interstate commerce, in violation of
18 U. S. C. § 1465, and with conspiracy to transport such
materials, 18 U. S. C. § 371. The conduct that gave rise to
the charges covered a period through February 27, 1973.
1 Two Courts of Appeals have found instructions derived from Miller
appropriate in prosecutions based on conduct occurring before the Miller
decision came down: United States v. Marks, 520 F. 2d 913 (CA6 1975)
(the instant case); and United States v. Friedman, 528 F. 2d 784 (CA10
1976), cert. pending, No. 75-1663. Three Courts of Appeals have reversed
convictions where Miller instructions were given by the District Court:
United States v. Wasserman, 504 F. 2d 1012 (CA5 1974); United States v.
Jacobs, 513 F. 2d 564 (CA9 1974); United States v. Sherpix, Inc., 168
U. S. App. D. C. 121, 512 F. 2d 1361 (1975).
In two earlier cases both conduct and trial occurred prior to Miller,
and the jury instructions were derived from Memoirs v. Massachusetts,
383 U. S. 413 (1966) (plurality opinion). United States v. Thevis,
484 F. 2d 1149 (CA5 1973) (Thevis I), cert. denied, 418 U. S. 932
(1974); United States v. Palladino, 490 F. 2d 499 (CAl 1974). The
Courts of Appeals there, foreshadowing to some extent our later decision
in Hanling v. United States, held that Miller did not void all Memoirsbased convictions, but that on review appellants were entitled to all the
benefits of both the Miller and Memoirs standards. See Hamling, 418
U. S., at 102. In later cases presenting similar facts, the Fifth Circuit has
applied its holding in Thevis I. See, e. g., United States v. Linetsky, 533
F. 2d 192 (1976)1; United States v. Thevis, 526 F. 2d 989 (1976) (Thevis
II), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 928 (1976). See also United States v. Hill, 500
F. 2d 733 (CA5 1974), cert. denied, 420 U. S. 952 (1975). And the Ninth
Circuit, following Hamling, has reached the same result. United States v.
Cutting, 538 F. 2d 835 (1976) (en bane), cert. denied, 429 U. S. 1052
(1977).

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion of the Court

430 U. S.

Trial did not begin until the following October. In the interim, on June 21, 1973, this Court decided Miller v. California, supra, and its companion cases.2 Miller announced
new standards for "isolat[ing] 'hard core' pornography from
expression protected by the First Amendment." 413 U. S.,
at 29.' That these new standards would also guide the
future interpretation of the federal obscenity laws was clear
from United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of Film, 413 U. S.

123, 129-130, and n. 7 (1973), decided the same day as Miller.
See Hamling v. United States, supra, at 105, 113-114.
Petitioners argued in the District Court that they were
entitled to jury instructions not under Miller, but under the
more favorable formulation of Memoirs v. Massachusetts,
383 U. S. 413 (1966) (plurality opinion).' Memoirs, in their
2 Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49
(1973); Kaplan v.
California, 413 U. S. 115 (1973); United States v. 12 200-ft. Reels of
Film, 413 U. S. 123 (1973); United States v. Orito, 413 U. S. 139 (1973).
3 Miller held:
"The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether 'the
average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find
that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest . . . ;
(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way,
sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and
(c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value." 413 U. S., at 24.
Under part (b) of the test, it is adequate if the statute, as written or
as judicially construed, specifically defines the sexual conduct, depiction
of which is forbidden. The Court in Miller offered examples of what
a State might constitutionally choose to regulate:
"(a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate
sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated.
"(b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation,
excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals." Id., at 25.
4The plurality in Memoirs held that "three elements must coalesce"
if material is to be found obscene and therefore outside the protection of
the First Amendment:
"[I]t must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material
taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material
is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community stand-

view, authoritatively stated the law in effect prior to Miller,
by which petitioners charted their course of conduct. They
focused in particular on the third part of the Memoirs test.
Under it, expressive material is constitutionally protected
unless it is "utterly without redeeming social value." 383
U. S., at 418. Under Miller the comparable test is "whether
the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value." 413 U. S., at 24. Miller,
petitioners argue, casts a significantly wider net than
Memoirs. To apply Miller retroactively, and thereby punish
conduct innocent under Memoirs, violates the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment-much as retroactive application of a new statute to penalize conduct innocent when
performed would violate the Constitution's ban on ex post
facto laws, Art. I, § 9, cl. 3; § 10, el. 1. The District
Court overruled these objections and instructed the jury
under the Miller standards. Petitioners were convicted,' and
a divided Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed.'
520 F. 2d 913 (1975). We now reverse.
II
The Ex Post Facto Clause is a limitation upon the powers
of the Legislature, see Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386 (1798), and
does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of
government. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 344 (1915).
But the principle on which the Clause is based-the notion
that persons have a right to fair warning of that conduct
which will give rise to criminal penalties-is fundamental to
our concept of constitutional liberty. See United States v.
ards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and
(c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value." 383 U. S.,

Harriss, 347 U. S. 612, 617 (1954); Lanzetta v. New Jersey,
306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939). As such, that right is protected
against judicial action by the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment. In Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S.
347 (1964), a case involving the cognate provision of the
Fourteenth Amendment, the Court reversed trespass convictions, finding that they rested on an unexpected construction
of the state trespass statute by the State Supreme Court:
"[An unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal
statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an
ex post facto law, such as Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution forbids. .

.

If a state legislature is barred by

the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing such a law, it
must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by the
Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same
result by judicial construction." Id., at 353-354.
Similarly, in Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313 (1972),
we reversed a conviction under a state obscenity law because
it rested on an unforeseeable judicial construction of the
statute. We stressed that reversal was mandated bdcause
affected citizens lacked fair notice that the statute would
be thus applied.
Relying on Bouie, petitioners assert that Miller and its
companion cases unforeseeably expanded the reach of the
federal obscenity statutes beyond what was punishable under
Memoirs. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument. It
noted-correctly-that the Memoirs standards never commanded the assent of more than three Justices at any one
time, and it apparently concluded from this fact that
Memoirs never became the law. By this line of reasoning,
one must judge whether Miller expanded criminal liability
by looking not to Memoirs but to Roth v. United States, 354
improper, and consequently the Government does not defend the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue but agrees with petitioners that
their convictions should not stand.

MARKS v. UNITED STATES
188

Opinion of the Court

U. S. 476 (1957), the last comparable plenary decision of this
Court prior to Miller in which a majority united in a single7
opinion announcing the rationale behind the Court's holding.
Although certain language in Roth formed the basis for the
plurality's formulation in Memoirs, Roth's test for distinguishing obscenity from protected speech was a fairly simple
one to articulate: "whether to the average person, applying
contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of
the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest."
354 U. S., at 489. If indeed Roth, not Memoirs, stated
the applicable law prior to Miller, there would be much to
commend the apparent view of the Court of Appeals that
Miller did not significantly change the law.
But we think the basic premise for this line of reasoning
is faulty. When a fragmented Court decides a case and no
single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of
five Justices, "the holding of the Court may be viewed as
that position taken by those Members who concurred in the
judgments on the narrowest grounds. . . ." Gregg v. Georgia,
428 U. S. 153, 169 n. 15 (1976) (opinion of STEWART, POWELL,
and STEVENS, JJ.). Three Justices joined in the controlling
opinion in Memoirs. Two others, Mr. Justice Black and
Mr. Justice Douglas, concurred on broader grounds in reversing the judgment below. 383 U. S., at 421, 424. They reiterated their well-known position that the First Amendment
provides an absolute shield against governmental action aimed
at suppressing obscenity. MR. JUSTICE STEWART also concurred in the judgment, based on his view that only "hardcore pornography" may be suppressed. Id., at 421. See
Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 499 (1966)
1Shortly after Memoirs, in response to the divergence of opinion among
Members of the Court, the Court began the practice of disposing of obscenity cases in brief per curiam decisions. Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S.
767 (1967), was the first. At least 31 cases were decided in this fashion.
They are collected in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U. S., at 82-83,
n. 8 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).

be constitutionally protected unless the prosecution carried
the burden of proving that they were "utterly without redeeming social value," and otherwise satisfied the stringent
Memoirs requirements.
Memoirs therefore was the law. Miller did not simply
clarify Roth; it marked a significant departure from Memoirs.
And there can be little doubt that the third test announced
in Miller-whether the work "lacks serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value"-expanded criminal liability.
The Court in Miller expressly observed that the "utterly
without redeeming social value" test places on the prosecutor
"a burden virtually impossible to discharge under our criminal
standards of proof." 413 U. S., at 22. Clearly it was
thought that some conduct which would have gone unpunished
under Memoirs would result in conviction under Miller.

MARKS v. UNITED STATES
188

Opinion of the Court

This case is not strictly analogous to Bouie. The statutory language there was "narrow and precise," 378 U. S., at
352, and that fact was important to our holding that the
expansive construction adopted by the State Supreme Court
deprived the accused of fair warning. In contrast, the statute
involved here always has used sweeping language to describe
that which is forbidden.' But precisely because the statute
is sweeping, its reach necessarily has been confined within
the constitutional limits announced by this Court. Memoirs
severely restricted its application. Miller also restricts its
application beyond what the language might indicate, but
Miller undeniably relaxes the Memoirs restrictions." The
effect is the same as the new construction in Bouie. Petitioners, engaged in the dicey business of marketing films subject to possible challenge, had no fair warning that their
products might be subjected to the new standards.
9The statute provides in pertinent part:
"Whoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign commerce for
the purpose of sale or distribution any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy
book, pamphlet, picture, film, paper, letter, writing, print, silhouette,
drawing, figure, image, cast, phonograph recording, electrical transcription
or other article capable of producing sound or any other matter of indecent or immoral character, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both." 18 U. S. C. § 1465.
10 For this reason, the instant case is different from Rose v. Locke,
423 U. S.48 (1975), where the broad reading of the statute at issue did
not upset a previously established narrower construction.
11In Hamling we rejected a challenge based on Bouie v. City of
Columbia, ostensibly similar to the challenge that is sustained here.
418 U. S., at 115-116. But the similarity is superficial only. There the
petitioners focused on part (b) of the Miller test. See n. 3, supra. They
argued that their convictions could not stand because Miller requires that
the categories of material punishable under the statute must be specifically
enumerated in the statute or in authoritative judicial construction. No
such limiting construction had been announced at the time they engaged
in the conduct that led to their convictions. We held that this made
out no claim under Bouie, for part (b) did not expand the reach of the
statute. "[T]he enumeration of specific categories of material in Miller

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion of the Court

430 U.S.

We have taken special care to insist on fair warning when
a statute regulates expression and implicates First Amendment values. See, e. g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.1, 40-41
(1976); Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S. 566, 573 (1974). Section 1465 is such a statute. We therefore hold, in accordance with Bouie, that the Due Process Clause precludes the
application to petitioners of the standards announced in
Miller v. California, to the extent that those standards may
impose criminal liability for conduct not punishable under
Memoirs. Specifically, since the petitioners were indicted for
conduct occurring prior to our decision in Miller, they are
entitled to jury instructions requiring the jury to acquit unless
it finds that the materials involved are "utterly without
redeeming social value." 1 At the same time we reaffirm our
which might be found obscene did not purport to make criminal, for the
purpose of 18 U. S. C. § 1461, conduct which had not previously been
thought criminal." 418 U. S., at 116.
For the reasons noted in text, the same cannot be said of part (c) of
the Miller test, shifting from "utterly without redeeming social value"
to "lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value." This was
implicitly recognized by the Court in Hamling itself. There the trial
took place before Miller, and the jury had been instructed in accordance
with Memoirs. Its verdict necessarily meant that it found the materials
to be utterly without redeeming social value. This Court examined the
record and determined that the jury's verdict "was supported by the
evidence and consistent with the Memoirs formulation of obscenity."
418 U. S., at 100. We did not avoid that inquiry on the ground that
Memoirs had no relevance, as we might have done if Miller applied
retroactively in all respects.
12 The
Court of Appeals stated, apparently without viewing the
materials, 520 F. 2d, at 923 n. 1 (McCree, J., dissenting), that in its
opinion the materials here were obscene under either Memoirs or Miller.
520 F. 2d, at 922. Such a conclusion, absent other dependable means of
knowing the character of the materials, is of dubious value. But even
if we accept the court's conclusion, under these circumstances it is not
an adequate substitute for the decision in the first instance of a properly

holding in Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S., at 102, that
"any constitutional principle enunciated in Miller which
would serve to benefit petitioners must be applied in their
case." "
Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.14
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART
and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and
dissenting in part.
I join the opinion of the Court insofar as it holds that the
retroactive application of the definition of obscenity announced in Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15 (1973), to the
potential detriment of a criminal defendant, violates the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See Bouie v. City of
Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964).
I cannot join, however, in the judgment remanding the case
for a new trial. Petitioners were convicted of transporting
obscene materials in interstate commerce in violation of 18
U. S. C. § 1465. I adhere to the view that this statute is
" 'clearly overbroad and unconstitutional on its face.' " See,
e. g., Cangiano v. United States, 418 U. S. 934, 935 (1974)
(BRENNAN, J., dissenting), quoting United States v. Orito, 413

instructed jury, as to this important element of the offense under 18
U. S. C. § 1465.
1"The Court of Appeals apparently thought that our remand in Miller
and the companion cases necessarily meant that Miller standards were
fully retroactive. 520 F. 2d, at 920. But the passage from Hamling
quoted in the text, which simply reaffirms a principle implicit in Miller,
makes it clear that the remands carried no such implication. Our 1973
cases were remanded for the courts below to apply the "benefits" of
Miller. See n. 3, supra.

the other questions presented in the petition.

MR. JUSTICE STEVENS,

I therefore

concurring in part and dissenting in

part.
There are three reasons which, in combination, persuade me
that this criminal prosecution is constitutionally impermissible.
First, as the Court's opinion recognizes, this "statute regulates
expression and implicates First Amendment values." Ante, at
196. However distasteful these materials are to some of us,
they are nevertheless a form of communication and entertainment acceptable to a substantial segment of society; otherwise,
they would have no value in the marketplace. Second, the
statute is predicated on the somewhat illogical premise that a
person may be prosecuted criminally for providing another with
material he has a constitutional right to possess. See Stanley
v. Gcorgia, 394 U. S. 557. Third, the present constitutional
standards, both substantive and procedural,* which apply to
these prosecutions are so intolerably vague that evenhanded
enforcement of the law is a virtual impossibility. Indeed, my
brief experience on the Court has persuaded me that grossly
disparate treatment of similar offenders is a characteristic of
the criminal enforcement of obscenity law. Accordingly, while
I agree with everything said in the Court's opinion, I am
unable to join its judgment remanding the case for a new trial.

*How, for example, can an appellate court intelligently determine
whether a jury has properly identified the relevant community standards?
