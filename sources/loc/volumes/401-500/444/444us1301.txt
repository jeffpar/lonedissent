ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF EXECUTION AND
REHEARING

PETITION FOR

Nos. A-172 and A-332. Decided October 18, 1979
Petition for rehearing of the Court's denial of an earlier application for
a stay of execution of death sentence pending the filing of a petition for
certiorari, see ante, p. 807, and an application for a stay of the rescheduled execution, are denied regardless of whether the submission is treated
as a request for a rehearing of the previous denial of a stay of execution
or as a new request for a stay of execution.

Circuit Justice.
On October 1, 1979, this Court denied the application of
Kirk Lenhard and George Franzen, acting as next friends of
Jesse Bishop, for a stay of execution pending the filing and
determination of a petition for certiorari. Lenhard v. Wolff,
ante, p. 807. Respondents have subsequently rescheduled
Bishop's execution for Monday, October 22, 1979. Lenhard
and Franzen have now submitted to me, as Circuit Justice,
a petition requesting rehearing of this Court's order of October 1, and an application for stay of execution pending determination of the petition for rehearing.
Resolving in applicants' favor all questions pertaining to
procedures and rules of the Court, I am satisfied that the
moving papers would not persuade the requisite number of
Justices to grant applicants' proposed petition for certiorari, to
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

OCTOBER TERM, 1979
Opinion in Chambers

444 U. S.

grant the petition for rehearing of this Court's previous denial
of a stay pending the filing of a petition for certiorari, or to
grant a stay pending Conference consideration of the petition
for rehearing. See this Court's Rule 58. As a consequence,
whether the submission presented to me as Circuit Justice on
October 16, 1979, is treated as a request for a rehearing of
our previous denial of a stay of execution, or as a new request
for a stay of execution, it is in all respects
Denied.
