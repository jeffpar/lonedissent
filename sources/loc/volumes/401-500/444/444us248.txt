THOMPSON v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
COURT OF APPEALS

No. 79-5180.

STATES

FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

Decided January 14, 1980

The Court of Appeals, in affirming petitioner's conviction, accepted the
Government's position that there had been no violation of the Department of Justice's "Petite" policy-whereby United States attorneys are
'forbidden to prosecute any person if the allegedly criminal behavior
was an ingredient of a previous state prosecution against that person
(as in the instant case), except where federal prosecution is specifically
authorized in advance by the Department itself upon a finding that the
prosecution will serve compelling interests of federal law enforcement.
But in this Court the Solicitor General conceded that the United States
Attorney had not obtained the proper authorization before bringing the
prosecution.
Held: This Court will vacate the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand
the case for that court's reconsideration in light of the Government's
present position, rather than, as requested by the Government, vacate
the Court of Appeals' judgment and remand the case to the District
Court with instructions to grant the Government's motion to dismiss
the indictment.
Certiorari granted; 601 F. 2d 591, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The Department of Justice has a firmly established policy,
known as the "Petite" policy, under which United States
Attorneys are forbidden to prosecute any person for allegedly
criminal behavior if the alleged criminality was an ingredient
of a previous state prosecution against that person. An exception is made only if the federal prosecution is specifically
authorized in advance by the Department itself, upon a finding that the prosecution will serve "compelling interests of
federal law enforcement." '

I Promulgated

in the wake of this Court's decision in Abbate v. United
States, 359 U. S. 187 (1959), the policy was first recognized by the Court

Per Curiam

In this case the Solicitor General has advised us that this
established Department policy was violated. Accordingly, he
urges the Court "to permit the effectuation of the government's policy against successive prosecutions by granting the
petition, vacating the judgment of the court of appeals, and
remanding the case to the district court with instructions to
grant the government's motion to dismiss the indictment."
In 1978, the petitioner was brought to trial in a Kentucky
court on a charge of armed burglary, and was convicted by a
jury of a lesser included offense. He was then prosecuted
and convicted in a Federal District Court on a charge of unlawfully possessing a firearm-a charge that grew out of the
same criminal transaction that had been the basis of the Kentucky prosecution. This federal conviction was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which accepted
the Government's then position that the "Petite" policy had
not been violated.2
The Solicitor General now concedes that the United States
Attorney did not obtain the authorization required under the
established Department policy before bringing the federal
prosecution. Moreover, "after careful review" of whether to
grant nunc pro tunc authorization, the Solicitor General
has concluded that "petitioner's prosecution for unlawfully
possessing a firearm was not supported by an independent
compelling federal interest not satisfied by the state prosecution for armed burglary."
Ever since the Justice Department established the "Petite"
policy in 1959, the Court has consistently responded to requests by the Government in cases such as this by granting
certiorari and vacating the judgments. See, e. g., Hammons
v. United States, 439 U. S. 810 (1978); Frakes v. United
in Petite v. United States, 361 U. S. 529, 531 (1960). It has since been
known as the "Petite" policy.
2 The pe7 curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals is unreported, but
the affirmance order is reported at 601 F. 2d 591.

U. S. 723 (1962); Petite v. United States, 361 U. S. 529
(1960).
This practice, which rests on the power of the Court to
"afford relief which is 'just under the circumstances,' 28
U. S. C. ยง 2106," Rinaldi v. United States, supra, at 25, n. 8,
is not unique to violations of the "Petite"policy. The Court
has also consistently vacated the judgments in other cases
which the Solicitor General has represented were in violation of other Justice Department policies. See, e. g.,
Blucher v. United States, 439 U. S. 1061 (1979) (obscenity
prosecution); Nunley v. United States, 434 U. S. 962 (1977)
(prosecution for willfully making false statements concerning matters within jurisdiction of Department of Treasury);
Margraf v. United States, 414 U. S. 1106 (1973) (prosecution
for carrying a "concealed deadly or dangerous" weapon while
boarding an aircraft); Robison v. United States, 390 U. S. 198
(1968) (addition of counts upon retrial); Redmond v. United
States, 384 U. S. 264 (1966) (obscenity prosecution).
The instant case differs from this long line of decisions only
in that here the Government mistakenly, and successfully,
represented to the Court of Appeals that Justice Department
policy had not been violated. Because of this circumstance,
we do not accept the Solicitor General's suggestion. Rather,
in response to his suggestion and upon an independent examination of the record, we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and certiorari, vacate the judgment, and remand the
case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of the
Government's present position. This course is one that the
Court has frequently taken when, as here, the Government
has changed its position while a criminal case is pending on
