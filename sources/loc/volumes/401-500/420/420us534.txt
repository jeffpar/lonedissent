ESTELLE, CORRECTIONS DIRECTOR v.
DORROUGH
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 74-479.

Decided March 17, 1975

A Texas statute provides for the automatic dismissal of an appeal
by a felony defendant if he escapes from custody pending the
appeal, except that the appeal will be reinstated if he voluntarily
surrenders within 10 days of his escape, or if he is under sentence
of life imprisonment or death the appellate court in its discretion
may reinstate the appeal if he returns to custody within 30 days
of his escape. Held: The statute does not violate the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
(a) It is not rendered unconstitutional by its separate treatment of prisoners under sentence of life imprisonment or death.
Texas can reasonably balance its concern with deterring escapes
and encouraging surrenders with its alternative interest in allowing the validity of particularly severe sentences to be tested by
appellate review.
(b) Nor is the statute rendered unconstitutional by its limiting
the appeal-dismissal requirement to those prisoners with appeals
pending at the time of their escape. Texas, as part of its policy
to deter escapes, is free to impose more severe sanctions on those
prisoners whose escape is reasonably calculated to disrupt the
very appellate process that they themselves have set in motion,
than it does on those who first escape, return, and then invoke
the appellate process.
Certiorari granted; 497 F. 2d 1007, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

Respondent Jerry Mack Dorrough was convicted in
1963 in a Texas District Court of robbery and sentenced
to a term of imprisonment for 25 years. After he was
sentenced and had filed an appeal to the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals, he escaped from the Dallas County
jail by stealing a federal mail truck. He was recaptured

two days after his escape. After his recapture, the Texas
Court of Criminal Appeals removed his appeal from its
docket pursuant to the provisions of Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Ann., Art. 44.09 (1966), which provides
for the automatic dismissal of such pending appeals by
an escaped felon upon escape with provision for reinstatement of the appeal if the felon voluntarily surrenders within 10 days of his escape.1
After recapture, respondent was tried and convicted on
federal charges and given a 25-year federal sentence which
he is currently serving. The State of Texas has filed
a detainer warrant with federal authorities against Dorrough in order to compel him to serve the remainder of his
state sentence upon release from federal custody. In
1972, respondent filed in the United States District Court
'Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Ann., Art. 44.09, provides:
"If the defendant, pending an appeal in the felony case, makes
his escape from custody, the jurisdiction of 'the Court of Criminal
Appeals shall no longer attach in the case. Upon the fact of such
escape being made to appear, the court shall, on motion of the State's
attorney, dismiss the appeal; but the order dismissing the appeal
shall be set aside if it is made to appear that the defendant has voluntarily returned within ten days to the custody of the officer from
whom he escaped; and in cases where the punishment inflicted by
the jury is death or confinement in an institution operated by the Department of Corrections for life, the court may in its discretion reinstate the appeal if the defendant is recaptured or voluntarily surrenders within thirty days after such escape."
This provision was adopted by Texas in 1879 replacing a somewhat
similar common-law rule discussed in Ex parte Wood, 19 Tex. Ct. App.
46 (1885). The clause authorizing discretionary reinstatement of
an appeal from a sentence of death or life imprisonment was added
by amendment in 1933. Laws 1933, c. 34. Since the statute
provides that jurisdiction shall "no longer attach" upon escape,
the escape itself divests the court of jurisdiction with later dismissal being a mere formality. Lafferty v. State, 123 Tex. Cr.
R. 570, 60 S. W. 2d 222 (1933); Ex parte Gurley, 104 Tex. Cr.

for the Northern District of Texas a complaint which was
treated by that court as a petition for writ of habeas
corpus, alleging that the 1963 dismissal of his appeal
under Art. 44.09 denied him equal protection of the law
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.2 The United
States District Court denied relief, holding that Art.
44.09 was a rational exercise of legislative power.3 The
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. It held that Art. 44.09 denied respondent equal
protection of the law, and ordered that the State's detainer warrant would be voided unless Texas provided
respondent with either a direct appeal or a new trial.'
Petitioner has now sought review by certiorari, pursuant
to 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1), of the judgment of the Court of
Appeals. For the reasons stated, we grant the writ and
reverse the judgment.
The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that there is
no federal constitutional right to state appellate review
of state criminal convictions. McKane v. Durston, 153
U. S. 684, 687 (1894); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, 18
2 Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, 410 U. S. 484
(1973), indicates that one under a state detainer warrant is considered to be in custody for the purpose of federal habeas relief. The
District Court concluded that respondent had properly exhausted
his state remedies, and the petitioner did not urge failure of exhaustion in the Court of Appeals.
The only contention presented to the District Court as evidenced
by its opinion was the constitutionality of Art. 44.09 discussed herein.
Respondent seeks here to raise other issues not raised below, at
least some of which were considered and rejected by other courts
during the course of his five prior actions in the federal system. See
327 F. 2d 667 (CA5 1964); 344 F. 2d 125 (CA5 1965); 397 F. 2d

Disposition .by dismissal of pending appeals of escaped
prisoners is a longstanding and established principle of
American law. 18 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 427, 429 (1950).
This Court itself has long followed the practice of declining to review the convictions of escaped criminal defendants. Smith v. United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876);
Bonahan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Eisler v.
United States, 338 U. S. 189 (1949); id., at 883; cf. Allen
v. Rose, 419 U. S. 1080 (1974). Thus in Molinaro v.
New Jersey, 396 U. S. 365 (1970), we dismissed the appeal of an escaped criminal defendant, stating that no
persuasive reason exists to adjudicate the merits of such
a case and that an escape "disentitles the defendant to
call upon the resources of the Court for determination of
his claims." Id., at 366. In Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S.
138 (1897), we upheld as against a constitutional due
process attack a state court's dismissal of the appeal of an
escaped prisoner and its refusal to reinstate the appeal
upon his later recapture. See also National Union v.
Arnold, 348 U. S. 37,43 (1954).
The Texas courts have found similar ends served by
Art. 44.09. It discourages the felony of escape and encourages voluntary surrenders.5 It promotes the efficient,
dignified operation of the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals.'
The Court of Appeals, however, found two classifications created by the statute to lack any rational relation
to its purposes and hence concluded that the statute
was unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protec5

tion Clause. That court recognized that appeals from
state criminal convictions are not "explicitly or implicitly
guaranteed by the Constitution," San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 33-34
(1973), and that this Court in dealing with equal protection challenges to state regulation of the right of
appeal in criminal cases had applied the traditional rational-basis test. Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U. S.305 (1966).
There this Court said:
"'The Constitution does not require things which
are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as
7 497 F. 2d, at 1012-1013. The court below specifically rejected
the notion that immediate dismissal with refusal to reinstate appeals of escaped defendants was constitutionally objectionable and
rested its decision wholly on the asserted lack of rational connection
between the statutory classifications and the statute's purposes.
But our Brother STEWART resurrects this rejected argument and
adopts it in his dissent, saying that the Texas statute may not rationally be said to discourage the felony of escape and encourage
voluntary surrender. Such a judgment, of course, is one in the
first instance for the legislature, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348
U. S. 483 (1955), and we may strike down such a legislative judgment only if we conclude that it is indeed irrational. We do
not believe that it is. Nor is it accurate to suggest that the only
purpose served by the Texas statute is the deterrence of escapes:
it is also designed to secure the State's interest in orderly judicial
procedure. The right of appeal from a judgment of conviction in
both the federal and state systems is almost uniformly conditioned,
for example, upon the filing of a notice of appeal within a prescribed
time limit. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4 (b); n. 10, infra. The vindication of orderly procedure secured by the Texas statute under attack
here is no less a permissible choice for the legislature than is the
vindication of that interest by such procedural requirements. In a
case indistinguishable from the present one on this issue, this Court
in Allen v. Georgia, 166 U. S. 138, 141 (1897), upheld the refusal of
the Georgia courts to reinstate the appeal of a recaptured prisoner,
stating that "it seems but a light punishment for such offence to
hold" that he has abandoned such appeal.

though they were the same.' Tigner v. Texas, 310
U. S. 141, 147. Hence, legislation may impose special
burdens upon defined classes in order to achieve
permissible ends. But the Equal Protection Clause
does require that, in defining a class subject to legislation, the distinctions that are drawn have 'some
relevance to the purpose for which the classification
is made.' Baxstrom v. Herold, 383 U. S. 107, 111;
Carringtonv. Rash, 380 U. S. 89, 93; Louisville Gas
Co. v. Coleman, 277 U. S. 32, 37; Royster Guano Co.
v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415." Id., at 309.
The Court of Appeals thought that this test rendered
the statute invalid for two reasons. First, while the
statute provides for reinstatement of the appeal of most
escaped felons only if they voluntarily surrender within
10 days, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals may in its
discretion reinstate the appeals of prisoners under a sentence of life imprisonment or death if they are returned to
custody within 30 days.8 Second, the statute applies
only to those prisoners with appeals pending at the time
of their escape; prisoners who have not invoked the appellate process by filing an appeal at the time of their
escape may still appeal after recapture if applicable appellate time limits have not run. We disagree with the
analysis of the Court of Appeals, and find that neither of
these distinctions offends the Equal Protection Clause.
Insofar as the separate treatment of prisoners under a
sentence of life imprisonment or death is concerned, we
see no reason why the Texas Legislature was not free to
separate these two most severe sentences from other
8 See n. 1, supra. The statute merely allows the court in its discretion to reinstate such appeals. In the past, the court has both
granted leave to reinstate and refused it under a test of "good
cause shown." Bland v. State, 224 S. W. 2d 479 (Tex. Crim. App.
1949); Foster v. State, 497 S. W. 2d 291 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973).

terms of imprisonment, and provide an additional period
of discretionary review for them but not for the remainder.
The Court of Appeals determined that under Texas law
a prisoner serving a sentence for a term greater than 60
years would not be eligible for parole any sooner than a
prisoner under life sentence, and from that fact concluded
that there could be no rational distinction between those
serving a life term and those serving a term in excess of
sixty years. 497 F. 2d 1007, 1012-1013. It is not altogether clear how respondent, who himself has been sentenced to 25 years, could assert the rights of those under
term sentences of 60 years or more.9 But apart from this
difficulty, we see no reason why the Texas Legislature
could not focus on the actual severity of the sentence imposed in making distinctions, rather than on the collateral
consequence of sentence elaborated by the Court of Appeals. The State of Texas could reasonably balance its
concern with deterring escapes and encouraging surrenders with its alternative interest in allowing the validity
of particularly severe sentences to be tested by appellate
review. In doing so, it was not required to draw lines
with "mathematical nicety." Lindsley v. National Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61, 78-79 (1911); Morey v. Doud,
354 U. S. 457, 463-464 (1957).
Nor do we find the statutory limitation of the dismissal
requirement to those prisoners with appeals pending at
the time of their escape violative of the Equal Protection
Clause. The Court of Appeals felt that the statute was
"underinclusive" for this reason, since a prisoner who had
not invoked the appellate process by filing an appeal
at the time of his escape might still appeal after recapture
if the prescribed time for filing an appeal had not expired.
Criminal defendants in Texas are subject to relatively
9 Cf. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21-24 (1960).

ESTELLE v. DORROUGH
534

Per Curiam

stringent time limits for filing their appeals."° Since an
escaped defendant cannot comply with the required appellate steps during the time he is not confined, these
time limits serve much the same function as Art. 44.09.
Whatever difference in treatment exists between the class
of prisoners who escape, return, and are nonetheless able
to file an appeal, and those whose appeals are dismissed
pursuant to Art. 44.09, is sufficiently rational to withstand a challenge based on the Equal Protection Clause.
Texas was free to deal more severely with those who
simultaneously invoked the appellate process and escaped
from its custody than with those who first escaped from
its custody, returned, and then invoked the appellate
process within the time permitted by law. While each
class of prisoners sought to escape, the first did so in the
very midst of their invocation of the appellate process,
while the latter did so before returning to custody and
commencing that process. If Texas is free to adopt a
policy which deters escapes by prisoners, as all of our
cases make clear that it is, it is likewise free to impose
more severe sanctions on those whose escape is reasonably
calculated to disrupt the very appellate process which
20See Tex. Code of Crim. Proc. Ann., Arts. 40.05, 40.09 (1966
ed., and Supp. 1974-1975), 44.08 et seq. For example, in the
cases cited by the lower court. as involving pre-appeal escapes with
subsequent appeals, the appellants forfeited substantially all of
their appeal rights through failure to file a timely record or bill of
exceptions. Webb v. State, 460 S. W. 2d 903 (Tex. Crim. App.
1970); McGee v. State, 445 S. W. 2d 187 (Tex. Crim. App. 1969).
In Texas the trial judge has the power to file the record with the
Court of Criminal Appeals and if he does so prior to recapture of an
escaped prisoner, the appeal is dismissed under Art. 44.09. Webb
v. State, 449 S. W. 2d 230 (Tex. Crim. App. 1969); Redman v. State,

MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with

whom MR. JUSTICE BREN-

NAN and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.

If the shortcomings of the challenged Texas statute
were only those addressed by the Court, I could join the
Court's opinion. For I agree that Art. 44.09 is not
rendered unconstitutional by its more lenient treatment
of escaped felons under sentence of death or life imprisonment, nor by its asserted "underinclusive" inapplicability
to a felon who escapes and is returned to custody involuntarily before his appeal is filed. But I think the Court
has failed to come to grips with the real constitutional
defect in the challenged statute.
"The peculiar problems posed by escape of a prisoner during the
ongoing appellate process were explored in Loyd v. State, 19 Tex.
Ct. App. R., at 155, in the course of upholding the constitutionality
of this statute:
"[L]et us suppose that the convict, pending his appeal, should
escape and remain at large twenty or thirty days; what disposition
should be made of his appeal? .

.

. Should this court wait until

his return to custody? How long must it wait? Until it suits the
prisoner's convenience? .

.

. [W]e are of the opinion that [Art.

44.09] is not only reasonable but eminently wise."

STEWART,

J., dissenting

In summarily reversing the judgment before us the
Court relies upon decisions establishing the long-settled
((practice of declining to review the convictions of escaped
criminal defendants." Ante, at 537. See Smith v.
United States, 94 U. S. 97 (1876); Bonahan v.
Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887); Molinaro v. New Jersey,
396 U. S. 365 (1970). See also Allen v. Georgia, 166
U. S. 138 (1897). But these decisions have universally
been understood to mean only that a court may properly
dismiss an appeal of a fugitive convict when, and because,
he is not within the custody and control of the court.
Until today, this Court has never intimated that under
the rule of Smith, Bonahan, and Molinaro a court might
dismiss an appeal of an escaped criminal defendant at a
time when he has been returned to custody, and thus
to the court's power and control.*
The rationale for the dismissal of an appeal when the
appellant is at large is clearly stated in the Smith
decision:
"It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to
hear a criminal case in error, unless the convicted
party, suing out the writ, is where he can be made
to respond to any judgment we may render. In
this case it is admitted that the plaintiff in error
The Court in Molinaro v. New Jersey relied upon a Note, 18
Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 427, 430 (1950), which is cited in the Court's
opinion today. Ante, at 537. The rule and its rationale are cor-

rectly stated in that Note: "A review of criminal appeal cases both
in state and federal courts shows that when an appellant has escaped
from custody and cannot be brought before the court, his case is
not left pending indefinitely. In the absence of any statutory regulation, dismissal is granted in some form ....

The basic theory

behind all criminal cases has always been that there must be a defendant in the power and under the control of the court, and that
there be someone who can respond to the judgment." 18 Geo. Wash.
L. Rev., at 428-429.

has escaped, and is not within the control of the
court below, either actually, by being in custody, or
constructively, by being out on bail. If we affirm
the judgment, he is not likely to appear to submit
to his sentence. If we reverse it and order a new
trial, he will appear or not, as he may consider most
for his interest. Under such circumstances, we are
not inclined to hear and decide what may prove to
be only a moot case." 94 U. S., at 97.
See also Bonahan v. Nebraska, 125 U. S. 692 (1887).
Here, as the Court notes, Dorrough was recaptured
two days after his flight. And, as the Court also notes,
his appeal was dismissed after his recapture. In this
situation, the rule of Smith-Bonahan-Molinaroprovides
no support whatever for the Texas law that deprived
Dorrough of his right to appeal.
If the challenged statute can be sustained, it must rest
upon the alternative ground advanced by the Courtthat, as a punitive and deterrent measure enacted in the
exercise of the State's police power, it "discourages the
felony of escape and encourages voluntary surrenders."
But the statute imposes totally irrational punishments
upon those subject to its application. If an escaped
felon has been convicted in violation of law, the loss of
his right to appeal results in his serving a sentence that
under law was erroneously imposed. If, on the other
hand, his trial was free of reversible error, the loss of
his right to appeal results in no punishment at all. And
those whose convictions would have been reversed if
their appeals had not been dismissed serve totally disparate sentences, dependent not upon the circumstances
of their escape, but upon whatever sentences may have
been meted out under their invalid convictions. In my
view, this random pattern of punishment cannot be considered a rational means of enforcing the State's interest

ESTELLE v. DORROUGH

in deterring and punishing escapes. Cf. McLaughlin v.
Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 191 (1964); Rinaldi v. Yeager,
384 U. S. 305, 309 (1966); U. S. Dept. of Agriculture v.
Moreno, 413 U. S. 528, 538 (1973).
A closely analogous case was considered by the Supreme Court of Idaho in In re Mallon, 16 Idaho 737, 740741, 102 P. 374 (1909). There the court considered a
statute providing:
" '... Every state prisoner confined in the state
prison for a term less than for life, who escapes
therefrom, is punishable by imprisonment in the
state prison for a term equal in length to the term
he was serving at the time of such escape; said
second term of imprisonment to commence from the
time he would otherwise have been discharged from
said prison.' "
The court concluded that the statute at issue was unconstitutional. Similarly the Supreme Court of Kansas
in State v. Lewin, 53 Kan. 679, 37 P. 168 (1894), held
unconstitutional a statute providing that upon escape a
convict was to be punished by imposition of the full term
of the sentence under which he had initially been imprisoned, without credit for any time served before the
escape.
Under these Idaho and Kansas statutes, two men
escaping at the same time and in the same manner could
receive wholly different sentences, not related at all to
the gravity of the offense of escape. That is precisely
the vice of the Texas statute at issue in the present case.
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
