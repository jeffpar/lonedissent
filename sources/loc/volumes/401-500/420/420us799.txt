MTM, INC., ET AL. v. BAXLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ALABAMA, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA

No. 73-1119.

Argued December 10, 1974-Decided March 25, 1975

This Court has no jurisdiction over an appeal under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253 from a three-judge District Court's order denying injunctive relief against enforcement of a state-court temporary
injunction under the Alabama nuisance statute closing appellant's
theater, where the three-judge court did not reach the merits of
appellant's constitutional attack on the nuisance statute but
instead based its order on the impropriety of federal intervention
in the state proceedings.
365 F. Supp. 1182, vacated and remanded.

Robert Eugene Smith argued the cause for appellants.
With him on the brief was Gilbert H. Deitch.

PER CURIAM.

The State of Alabama brought suit against appellant
MTM in state court under the Alabama nuisance law,
Ala. Code, Tit. 7, §§ 1081-1108 (1958),' seeking to
enjoin the continued operation of a nuisance by MTM.
It alleged that because of convictions for violations of

' Nuisance is defined in § 1091 of this Act as "any place ... upon

continued, or exists, and the personal property and contents used in
conducting or maintaining any such place for any such purpose."
The remainder of the law consists of detailed procedural provisions
governing the maintenance of a nuisance action.

local obscenity laws by the Pussycat Adult Theater, an
enterprise owned by MTMV in Birmingham, Ala., the
theater constituted a nuisance under this statute.2 After
a hearing on the complaint, the state court issued a temporary injunction under the nuisance law, closing the
theater.3
After issuance of the temporary injunction and while
action on the request for a permanent injunction was
pending in state court, appellant filed this action in the
United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama under the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42
U. S. C. § 1983. It asked the federal court to enjoin enforcement of the state-court temporary injunction and to
declare the Alabama nuisance law unconstitutional. Appellant claimed that the challenged statutory provisions
and the state-court temporary injunction infringed its
First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.
A three-judge federal court was convened pursuant to
28 U. S. C. § 2281 to consider appellant's complaint.
Without resolving the constitutional merits of the complaint, the three-judge court dismissed the complaint
without prejudice.' In view of the pendency of the
state proceedings, the three-judge District Court applied

differences in the facts surrounding Mobile's participation in this
action and those surrounding MTM's participation. For simplicity,

appellant.

Although expedited appeal of the temporary injunction was
available in state courts under Ala. Code, Tit. 7, §§ 757, 1057
(1958), appellant initiated no state-court appeal prior to the threejudge court's decision on the merits. At the request of appellant,
hearing on the permanent injunction in state court was deferred

the test enunciated in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37
(1971),5 and concluded that federal intervention as requested by appellant would be improper.
Appellant has brought the case directly to this Court,
asserting that jurisdiction exists under 28 U. S. C. § 1253,
and arguing that the requirements of Younger v. Harris,
supra, did not preclude relief on these facts. We noted
probable jurisdiction over this appeal and set this case
for argument in tandem with Huff man v. Pursue, Ltd.,
ante, p. 592. 415 U. S. 974 (1974).
Unless jurisdiction over this direct appeal from the
three-judge court decision below is conferred by 28
U. S. C. § 1253, we are without authority to entertain
it.' Section 1253 provides:
"Except as otherwise provided by law, any party
may appeal to the Supreme Court from an order

interlocutory or permanent injunction in any civil
sWe, of course, express no view on the correctness of the lower
court's holding.
6 The question of jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253 was not raised in the Jurisdictional Statement, the Motion
to Dismiss, or in the initial briefs filed in this case. At oral argument in light of our intervening_ decision in Gonzalez v. Employees
Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90 (1974), handed down after the filing of
briefs in this case and on the day that this case was orally argued,
it was suggested from the bench that supplemental briefs addressed
to the issue of jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1253 in light of
Gonzalez, supra, be submitted. Appellant has submitted a brief
attempting to distinguish Gonzalez, supra, which we have considered in resolving this jurisdictional question. See Brown Shoe Co. v.
United States, 370 U. S. 294, 305-306 (1962). While our normal
practice under Rule 16 (6) of this Court has been to postpone notation of probable jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits
where jurisdictional problems are presented, our intervening decision
in Gonzalez, supra, squarely raised the jurisdictional question encountered here after we had noted probable jurisdiction in the case.

action, suit or proceeding required by any Act of
Congress to be heard and determined by a district
court of three judges."
Appellant argues that its complaint presented a "suit...
required . ..to be heard" by a three-judge court 7 and
that the dismissal of its complaint seeking injunctive
relief constituted "an order ...denying... an interlocutory or permanent injunction" within the meaning of
§ 1253.
In Gonzalez v. Employees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90
(1974), we recently discussed in some detail the question
of what constitutes an order "denying" injunctive relief
for purposes of § 1253. There we held that direct appeal to this Court under § 1253 did not lie from the order
of a three-judge court dismissing a complaint because of
an absence of standing where the three-judge court did
not reach the merits of the constitutional claim presented. Although our decision rested at least partially
on the ground that a three-judge court was not "recrired" where the ground for decision below was an absence of standing, 419 U. S., at 100, we also explored the
question of whether an order of a three-judge court "denies" an injunction, for purposes of § 1253, where there is
no adverse resolution of the constitutional claims presented. Although noting that certain decisions of this
Court and a literal reading of § 1253 might be taken to
support the notion that a denial of injunctive relief on
any basis by a three-judge court is within the purview
of § 1253, we concluded that stare decisis is entitled to
7 There is no occasion for us to decide in this case the circumstances under which a single judge may dismiss the complaint
without convening a three-judge court where the ground for such
dismissal rests solely on the impropriety of federal intervention.

less than its usual weight in this area, and that "the
opaque terms and prolix syntax" of this statute were not
capable of literal reading. 419 U. S., at 96-97. In
focusing on the question of whether direct review by this
Court under § 1253 is available in the absence of a threejudge court decision resting on resolution of the constitutional merits of a complaint, we stated:
"Mercantile argues that § 1253 should be read to
limit our direct review of three-judge-court orders
denying injunctions to those that rest upon resolution of the constitutional merits of the case. There
would be evident virtues to this rule. It would lend
symmetry to the Court's jurisdiction since, in reviewing orders granting injunctions, the Court is necessarily dealing with a resolution of the merits. While
issues short of the merits-such as justiciability,
subject-matter jurisdiction, equitable jurisdiction,
and abstention-are often of more than trivial consequence, that alone does not argue for our reviewing them on direct appeal. Discretionary review in
any case would remain available, informed by the
mediating wisdom of a court of appeals. Furthermore, the courts of appeals might in many instances
give more detailed consideration to these issues than
this Court, which disposes of most mandatory appeals
in summary fashion." 419 U. S., at 99.
The conflicting decisions of this Court on the question
of whether § 1253 jurisdiction attaches where a threejudge federal court fails to reach the merits of a constitutional claim for injunctive relief do not provide a
consistent answer to this question. Compare Lynch v.
HouseholdFinance Corp., 405 U. S. 538 (1972), with Mengelkoch v. Industrial Welfare Comm'n, 393 U. S. 83
(1968); Rosado v. Wyman, 395 U. S. 826 (1969); Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427 (1970). See Gonzalez v.

Employees Credit Union, supra, at 95 n. 11; 9 J. Moore,
Federal Practice T 110.03 [3], pp. 76-79 (2d ed. 1973).
It is certain that the congressional policy behind
the three-judge court and direct-review apparatusthe saving of state and federal statutes from improvident
doom at the hands of a single judge-will not be impaired
by a narrow construction of § 1253. A broad construction of the statute, on the other hand, would be at odds
with the historic congressional policy of minimizing the
mandatory docket of this Court in the interest of sound
judicial administration. Phillips v. United States, 312
U. S. 246, 250-251 (1941); Gonzalez v. Employees Credit
Union, supra, at 98.
In light of these factors, we conclude that a direct
appeal will lie to this Court under § 1253 from the order
of a three-judge federal court denying interlocutory or
permanent injunctive relief only where such order rests
upon resolution of the merits of the constitutional claim
presented below.
In the instant case, the three-judge court below did
not reach the merits of appellant's constitutional attack
on the Alabama statute and instead based its order on
the impropriety of federal intervention under our decision
in Younger v. Harris,401 U. S. 37 (1971). In such circumstances, we are without jurisdiction to consider this
appeal. The correctness of the application of Younger
on these facts by the District Court is for the Court of
Appeals to determine. Accordingly, we vacate the order
before us and remand this case to the District Court so
that a fresh order may be entered and a timely appeal
prosecuted to the Court of Appeals.8
It is so ordered.

WHrrE, J., concurring in result

MR. JUSTICE WHaITE,

concurring in the result.

The Court- holds that dismissing a suit on Younger v.
Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), grounds is not an order
denying an injunction for the purposes of 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253 and is therefore not appealable directly to this
Court, even assuming that the order could be issued only
by a three-judge court. I agree with the result but not
with this mode of achieving it.
If only a three-judge court may order such a dismissal,
I have great difficulty in excluding such an order from the
reach of the plain terms of § 1253. The sole justification
for so manhandling the language of the section is to avoid
our hearing a direct appeal on a nonconstitutional issue
of federal law that has little if any connection with the
reasons for requiring either three-judge courts or direct
review of their decisions. That procedure was adopted
to protect state statutes from improvident injunctions
issued by a single federal judge on federal constitutional
grounds. The more straightforward approach to this
case would be to hold that decisions on issues other than
requests for injunctive relief challenging the constitutionality of state statutes need not be made by three
judges but rather are to be made or deemed to be made
by single-judge courts whose decisions are appealable only
to the courts of appeals. Proceeding in this manner
would require no more than construing 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281
and 2284 (3) and (4), in the light of their original purpose, as applying only to orders granting or denying interlocutory or permanent injunctions where the constitutionality of state statutes is involved.
This approach may appear to be at odds with Idlewild
Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U. S. 713 (1962). There
the Court held that a three-judge court is required where
a statute was challenged on constitutional grounds but
where a single judge ordered abstention pending presen-

tation of the issues to a state court. The court ruled that
as long as the constitutional issue was substantial, a basis
for equitable relief was at least alleged in the complaint,
and the other requirements for three-judge-court juristiction were satisfied, a three-judge court must be convened.
But even within this holding, if it appears on the face of
the complaint that there is no ground for equitable relief,
there would be no necessity for convening a three-judge
court. A single judge should be able to dismiss such a
case, therefore, if the pleadings show that there is litigation pending in the state court in which the constitutional
challenge could be presented and nothing is alleged to
excuse federal intervention.'
Even if grounds for equitable relief are alleged in a
complaint, a single judge should be able to rule on a motion to dismiss based on Younger v. Harris grounds.
Much water has gone over the dam since Idlewild was
decided. For one thing, in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382
U. S. 111 (1965), the Court made very plain that the
three-judge-court requirement applied only to injunction
suits depending entirely upon a substantive provision of
the Constitution; injunctions by a single judge could be
granted or denied where the claim of invalidity rested on
a conflict with a federal statute. In Swift, the "statutory" claim was joined with the constitutional issue, but
1

Even on the Court's own terms, Idlewild is not a strong reason
for its reluctance to say that a three-judge court was not required
here. Idlewild concerned abstention under Railroad Comm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941).
Under Pullman abstention, the
federal court retains jurisdiction while the state-law issues are

adjudicated in state court, and therefore no relief has been finally
denied in federal court. In contrast to that deferral of relief,
Younger v. Harris,401 U. S. 37 (1971), abstention mandates dismissal
of the federal action. It is straining the ordinary meaning of words
to say that requested injunctive relief has not been denied in such a
situation.

MTM, INC. v. BAXLEY

the latter was deemed frivolous, leaving only the statutory issue for which three judges were not required. But
in Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528, 543-545 (1974), we
held that even where the statutory claim is joined with
a substantial constitutional claim, the former could be,
and should be, decided first by a single judge.
The plain import of these cases is that three judges
are not required merely because a complaint states a
cause of action for an injunction based on a constitutional
challenge to a state statute. All non-three-judge-court
issues may be sorted out and tried by a single judge.
Cases like Idlewild are derelicts and should be expressly
cleared from the scene.2
Gonzalez v. Employees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90
(1974), has shown the way and I would follow its
lead. This is especially desirable in this case; for the
result of the Court's holding is to require a three-judge
court to pass on Younger v. Harris issues and to direct
appeals from those orders to the court of appeals, where
they would normally be heard again by three judges.
This is an exorbitant expenditure of judicial manpower,
and without reason in light of our cases.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
Like my Brother WHITE, I have great difficulty understanding how it is possible, within the plain terms of 28
U. S. C. § 1253, to avoid a direct appeal to this Court
from a dismissal which is required to be made by a district court of three judges. The Court does not decide
whether one or three judges would be required for the
disposition made below. Rather, it concludes that direct
appeal to this Court under § 1253 lies only from the
denial of injunctive relief by a three-judge court which

"rests upon resolution of the merits of the constitutional
claim presented below." Ante, at 804.
I could at least concur in the result if I believed that
a single judge had the power to dismiss based on
Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971), grounds, but I
have my doubts about that proposition as well. Recently
the Court's hostility to three-judge courts has led it to
restrict the need for such courts. See Gonzalez v. Employees Credit Union, 419 U. S. 90 (1974); Hagans v.
Lavine, 415 U. S. 528 (1974). I joined in those decisions, but I have come to the conclusion that the Court
is going too far. I therefore must register my dissent.
Many have argued in recent years that the three-judge
court is no longer needed, that it has outlived its original
purposes and should therefore be eliminated as a needless waste of judicial resources.1 Whether the threejudge court is any longer needed for the reasons which
led to its creation I do not know. But I note that at
least some observers believe the three-judge court to be
an important institution for litigants such as civil rights
and welfare plaintiffs. Three judges may well display
more sensitivity to national policies and perspectives
than would a single judge, and when three judges decide
in favor of a minority or an unpopular group their
decision is likely to inspire more respect than would the
decision of a single judge.2
I do not know how these various factors should be

weighed. Perhaps the three-judge-court system, along
with direct review here, should be eliminated or altered
in a major way; perhaps not. Under the Constitution
this decision is one for the Congress and not the courts.'
Moreover, there are practical reasons to avoid judicial
usurpation of power over jurisdiction. Under the law
as currently interpreted substantial difficulties can arise
as to whether initial decisions should be made by a single
judge or three judges and as to whether appeals should
be to the courts of appeals or to this Court.' A case can
be split into pieces, making it difficult, for courts to
resolve issues in a way which takes into account all relevant aspects of the lawsuit. See Parks v. Harden, 504
F. 2d 861, 865-867 (CA5 1974). We should not encourage this kind of fragmentation in the name of judicial
economy, for it will ultimately lead to much delay and
duplication of effort.
To some extent the confusion surrounding three-judge
courts is the fault of the statutory scheme, but I think
that much of the blame must be placed on this Court.
What is the status of Idlewild Liquor Corp. v. Epstein,
370 U. S. 713 (1962), after today's decision?
Perhaps
Idlewild should be distinguished or overruled, as my
Brother WHi'rT urges, but I remain unconvinced. I
think we would do better to leave settled as many principles as we reasonably can in this troubled area, and I
certainly do not think that we help matters by twisting

three-judge-court issue, as is illustrated by its recent actions in this
