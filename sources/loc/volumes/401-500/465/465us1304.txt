OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion in Chambers

465 U. S.

LILES ET AL. v. NEBRASKA ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-615.

Decided February 13, 1984

An application for a stay, pending review by this Court, of a Nebraska
District Court's contempt order committing applicants to jail is denied
because of lack of jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. ยง 2101(f), where, after
the application was filed with the Circuit Justice, the-Nebraska Supreme
Court dismissed each applicant's appeal from the contempt order to that
court "for lack of an appealable order."
JUSTICE BLACKMUN,

Circuit Justice.

On January 31, 1984, Ralph Liles and others presented to
me, as Circuit Justice, an application for a stay, pending review here, of an order of the District Court of Cass County,
Nebraska, issued on December 14, 1983. That order committed the applicants to the Cass County jail for their refusal
to answer certain questions when ordered to do so by the
District Court. The Fifth Amendment claim made by the
applicants did not appear to be insubstantial. At the time
that the applicants submitted their application for a stay,
each had an appeal from the contempt order pending before
the Nebraska Supreme Court.
On February 7, respondents filed an opposition to the
application for stay. On February 9, the Supreme Court of
Nebraska entered an order in each applicant's case dismissing his appeal to that court "for lack of an appealable order."
With these cases in that posture, I have no jurisdiction to
act pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 2101(f). I therefore must deny
the relief requested of me by the applicants. This, of course,
is without prejudice to any further application, if necessary,
if and when the cases return in a more favorable posture.
