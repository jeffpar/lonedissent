Per Curiam

WRENN v. BENSON ET AL.
ON MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS
No. 88-6494.

Decided April 17, 1989*

Since October Term 1986, pro se petitioner has filed 22 petitions for certiorari with this Court and has been denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis 19 times, most recently in Wrenn v. Benson and Wrenn v. Ohio
Dept. of Mental Health, 489 U. S. 1095. The supporting affidavits of
indigency filed with his last nine petitions for certiorari indicate that his
financial condition has remained substantially unchanged.
Held: The Clerk of the Court is directed not to accept further filings from
petitioner in which he seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis unless
the affidavit submitted with the filing indicates that his financial condition has substantially changed from that reflected in the affidavits
he submitted in Wrenn v. Benson and Wrenn v. Ohio Dept. of Mental
Health, supra. Justice is not served if the Court continues to process
his requests when his financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a previous filing for which he was denied leave to proceed in
forma pauperis. See In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180.
Order entered.

OCTOBER TERM, 1988
STEVENS, J., dissenting

490 U. S.

In In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 184 (1989), we said:
"Every paper filed with the Clerk of this Court, no matter
how repetitious or frivolous, requires some portion of the institution's limited resources. A part of the Court's responsibility is to see that these resources are allocated in a way
that promotes the interests of justice." We do not think that
justice is served if the Court continues to process petitioner's
requests to proceed informa pauperis when his financial condition has not changed from that reflected in a previous filing
in which he was denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
We direct the Clerk of the Court not to accept any further
filings from petitioner in which he seeks leave to proceed
in forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 46.1, unless the
affidavit submitted with the filing indicates that petitioner's
financial condition has substantially changed from that reflected in the affidavits submitted by him in Wrenn v. Benson
and Wrenn v. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health, 489 U. S. 1095
(1989).
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins,
dissenting.
I dissent from this order for the reasons stated in In re
McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 185 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting),
and in Brown v. Herald Co., 464 U. S. 928 (1983) (BRENNAN,
J., dissenting).

dissenting.
Because I believe the preparation and enforcement of orders of this kind consume more of the Court's valuable time
than is consumed by the routine denial of frivolous motions
and petitions, see In re McDonald, 489 U. S. 180, 185 (1989)
(BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Brown v. Herald Co., 464 U. S.
928 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); id., at 931 (STEVENS,
J., dissenting), I respectfully dissent.
JUSTICE STEVENS,
