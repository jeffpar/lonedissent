PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI

TO THE SUPREME

COURT OF UTAH

No. 75-1106.

Decided April 26, 1976

The provision in the venue section of the National Bank Act, 12
U. S. C. § 94, that actions against a national banking association
lie "in any State, county, or municipal court in the county or
city in which said association is located having jurisdiction in similar cases," is not permissive but mandatory. Mercantile Nat.
Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555; Michigan Nat. Bank v. Robertson, 372 U. S. 591. Therefore, petitioner national banking association, which has its principal place of business in New York
and has no offices or agents, and does not regularly conduct
business, in Utah, could not be sued by respondent in a Utah state
court, unless it can be shown that petitioner waived the provisions of § 94.
Certiorari granted; 542 P. 2d 1079, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The petitioner is a national banking association with
its principal place of business in New York. It has no
offices or agents in Utah and does not regularly conduct
business in that State. The respondent Associates of
Obstetrics brought a breach-of-contract action against
the petitioner in a Utah state court, seeking damages on
the ground that the petitioner had induced the respondent to lend a large sum of money to a Utah corporation
on the representation that the loan would be protected
and that the petitioner had defaulted on this agreement.
The petitioner moved to dismiss the complaint on the
basis of the venue provision of the National Bank Act,
Rev. Stat. § 5198, 12 U. S. C. § 94. That section provides that venue for actions against a national banking

association shall lie "in any State, county, or municipal
court in the county or city in which said association is
located having jurisdiction in similar cases." After the
Utah trial court granted the petitioner's motion, the
respondent filed an amended complaint alleging that the
petitioner had waived the protection of § 94 by making a loan to the Utah corporation and seeking to place
that corporation into bankruptcy in a Federal District
Court in Utah. The state trial court denied a motion to
dismiss the amended complaint and the Utah Supreme
Court affirmed, holding that the venue provision of the
National Bank Act is "permissive and not exclusive,"
Associates of Obstetrics v. Apollo Productions,Inc., 542
P. 2d 1079, 1080.
In Mercantile Nat. Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U. S.555
(1963), and Michigan Nat. Bank v. Robertson, 372 U. S.
591 (1963), this Court held that the provision in § 94
concerning venue in state, county, or municipal courts is
not permissive, but mandatory, and, therefore, "that
national banks may be sued only in those state courts in
the county where the banks are located." 371 U. S., at
561. Accordingly, we grant the petition for certiorari
and vacate the judgment of the Utah Supreme Court.
Since that court did not reach the respondent's contention that the petitioner had waived the provisions of § 94,
the case is remanded for a determination of that issue.*
See Michigan Nat. Bank v. Robertson, supra, at 594.
It is so ordered.

ciations from suit in counties or cities other than those in
which they were located was a personal privilege of the
associations which could be waived by them. Id., at 145.
This exception to the otherwise mandatory nature of this
venue limitation has been carried forward in the current
recodification of the federally created privilege. Michigan Nat. Bank v. Robertson, 372 U. S. 591, 594 (1963).
In Neirbo Co. v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 308
U. S. 165 (1939), the Court held that by designating
an agent for service of process within a State, a corporation gave its consent to be sued in federal court within
that State notwithstanding the provisions of the predecessor to 28 U. S. C. § 1391 (c), which accorded defendants in federal courts a privilege regarding venue essentially equivalent to that found in 12 U. S. C. § 94. I see
no reason for concluding that the venue privilege extended by § 94 is of a different nature from that contained in § 1391, or that it may not be similarly waived
by the conduct of a national banking association. Thus,
I believe Neirbo establishes that petitioner National Bank
could be deemed to have consented to being sued in
Utah by providing an agent for service of process in that
State or otherwise qualifying to do business therein according to Utah law. The record before us does not
reveal whether such facts may exist in this case, however,
and the Utah courts apparently engaged in no inquiry
along these lines. I therefore agree with the Court's
decision to remand this case to the Utah court in order
that it can examine whether petitioner may have waived
the privilege afforded it by § 94.
the petitioner to a Utah corporation and that the petitioner has
claimed a security interest in the assets of that corporation in a
bankrupcy petition. But the Robertson decision established that
such factors do not bring a case within the local-action exception
to § 94 carved out by Casey v. Adams, supra. See 372 U. S., at 593594.
