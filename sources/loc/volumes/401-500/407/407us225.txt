APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT-COURT FOR THE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

No. 70-27. Argued December 13, 1971-Decided June 19, 1972
Title 42 U. S. C.'§ 1983, which authorizes a suit in-equity to redress
the deprivation under color of state law "of any rights, privileges,
or immunities secured by the- Constitution . . '. ," is within that
exception of the federal anti-injunction statute, 28 U. S. C. § 2283,
that provides 'that a federal court may not enjoin state court

proceedings "except as. expressly authorized by Act of Congress."
And in this § 1983 action, though -the principles of equity, comity,
and federalism that must restrain a federal court when asked to
enjoin a state court proceeding (cf. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S.
37, and companion cases) are not questioned, the District Court
is held to have erred in holding that the anti-injunction statute
absolutely barred its enjoining a pending state court proceeding
under any circumstances whatsoever. Pp. 228-243.

Opinion of "the Court

407 U. S.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The federal anti-injunction statute provides that a
federal court "may not grant an injunction to stay
proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where necessary in aid
of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments." ' An Act of Congress, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, expressly authorizes a "suit in equity" to redress "the
•deprivation," under color of state law, "of any rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution ...
, 2 The question before us is whether this
"Act of Congress" comes within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute so as to
pernfit a federal court in a'§ 1983 suit to grant an
injunction to stay a proceeding pending in a state court.

This question, which has divided the federal courts,'
has lurked in the background of many of our recent
4
cases, but we have not until today explicitly decided it.
128"U. S. C. § 2283.
The statute provides in full: "Every person who, under color of
any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or
Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the
United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the
deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the
Constitution and laws, shall be liable to-the party injured in an
action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."

(§ 1983 is
an "expressly authorized" exception), with Baines v. City of Danville,
337 F. 2d 579 (CA4) (§ 1983 is not an "expressly authorized"
exception).

Opinion of the Court

I
The prosecuting attorney of Bay, County, Florida,
brought a proceeding in a Florida court to close down
the appellant's' bookstore as a public nuisance under
the claimed authority of Florida law. The state court
entered a preliminary order prohibiting continued operation of the bookstore.: After further inconclusive
proceedings in the state courts, the appellant filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Florida, alleging that.the actions
of the state judicial and law enforcement officials were
depriving him of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Relying upon 42 U. S. C. § 1983,'
he asked for injunctive and declaratory relief against
the state court proceedings, on the ground that Florida
laws were being unconstitutionally applied by the state
court so. as to cause him great and irreparable harm.
A single federal district judge issued temporary restraining orders, and a three-judge court was convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §§ 2281 and 2284'. 'After a hearing,
the three-judge court dissolved the temporary restraining orders and refused to enjoin the state court proceeding, holding that the "injunctive relief sought here

statute states in relevant part:
"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil
action authorized by law to 'be commenced by any person:
"(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law,
statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege
or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or
by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of' citizens
or of all persons within the jurisdiction of -the United States ......

as to the proceedings pending in the Florida courts does
not come. under any of the exceptions set forth in Section 2283. It is not. expressly authorized by Act
of Congress,. it is not' necessary in the aid of this
court's jurisdiction, and it is not sought in order
to protect or effectuate any judgment of this court."

probable jurisdiction. 402 U. S. 941.
II
In denying injunctive relief, the District Court relied
on this Court's decision in Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.
v. 13rotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S..
281. The Atlantic Coast Line case did not deal with
the "expressly ' authorized" exception of the antiinjunction statute,1 but the Court's opinion in that case
does bring into sharp focus the critical importance of
the question now before us. For in that case we ex.pressly rejected the view that the anti-injunction statute
merely states a flexible doctrine of comnity,8 and made
clear that the statute imposes an absolute ban upon
the issuance of a federal injunction against a pending
OThe statute provides: "Except as otherwise provided by law,
any party may appeal- to the Supreme Court from an order granting
or denying, after notice and hearing, an interlocutory or permanent
injunction in any civil action, suit or proceeding required by any
Act of Congress to be heard and determined by a district court of
three judges."
7 At issue were the other two exceptions of the anti-injunction
statute: "where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect
or effectuate its judgments." Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 398 U. S. 281, 288.

Opinion of the Court

state court proceeding, in the absence of one of the
recognized exceptions:
"On its face the present Act is an absolute. prohibition against enjoining state court proceedings,
unless the injunction falls within one of three specifically defined exceptions. The respondents here
have: .intimated that the Act only establishes a
'principle of comity,' not a binding rule on the
power of the federal courts. The argument implies
that in certain circumstances a federal court may
enjoin state court proceedings even if that action
cannot be justified by any of the three exceptions.
[We]
We cannot accept any such contention ....
hold that any injunction against state court proceedings otherwise proper under general equitable
principles must be based on one of the specific
statutory exceptions to § 2283 if it is to be. upheld. . . ...398 U. S., at 286-287.
It follows, in the present context, that, if 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983 is not within the. "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, then a federal equity
court is wholly without power to grant any relief in
a § 1983 suit seeking to stay a state court proceeding.
In short, if a '§ 1983 action is not an "expressly authorized" statutory exception, the anti-injunction law absolutely prohibits in such an action ill federal equitable
intervention in a pending state court proceeding, whether
civil or criminal, and regardless of how extraordinary
the particular circumstances may be.
Last Term, in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, and
its companion cases,' the Court dealt at length with
the subject of federal judicial intervention in pending

state criminal prosecutions. In 'Younger a three-judge
federal district court in a § 1983 action had enjoined
a criminal proscution pending -in, a Calfornia court.
In. asking us to reverse that- judgment,. the appellant
argued that the injunction ,was in violation of the federal anti-injunction statute.,; 401 U. S., at 40. But the
Court carefully eschewed any :reliance on the statute
in reversing the judgment, basing its decision, instead
upon what the Court called "Our Federalism"-upon
"the national policy forbidding federal courts to stay or
enjoin pending state court proceedings except inder
special circumstances: ' 401 U. S., at 41, 44.
In Younger, this Court emphatically reaffirmed "the
fundamental policy against federal interference with,
state criminal prosecutions.' 401 U. S., at 46. It made
clear that even "the' possible unconstitutionality of a
.statute 'on its face" does not in itself justify an injunction against good-faith attempts to 'enforce it." 401
U. -S., at 54. At the same time, however, the Court
clearly left room for federal injunctive intervention in
a pending state court prosecution in certain exceptional
circumstances-where irreparable injury is "both great
and immediate," 401 U. S., 'at 46,' where the state law
is " 'flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions,'" 401 U. S., at 53, or where there
is a showing of "bad faith, harassment, or . other
unusual circumstances that would call for equitable relief." 401 U. S., at, 54. In the companion case of
Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S 82, the Court said that
"[o]nly in cases of proven harassment or prosecutions
undertaken by state officials in bad faith without hope
of obtaining a valid conviction and perhaps in other
extraordinary circumstances where irreparable injury can
be shown is federal injunctive relief against pending'

state prosecutions appropriate." 401 U. S.,,at 85. See
also Dyson v. Stein, 401 U. S. 200, 203.
While the Court in Younger and its companion cases
expressly disavowed deciding the 'question now before
us,-whether § 1983 comes Within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, 401 U. S.,
at 54--it is evident that our decisions in those cases
cannot be disregarded in deciding this question., In the
first place, if § 1983 is not within the statutory exception, then the anti-injunction statute would have absolutely barred the injunction issued in Younger, as the
appellant in that case argued, and there would have
been no occasion whatever for the Court to decide that.
case upon the "policy" ground of "Our Federalism."
Secondly, if § 1983is not within the "expressly authorized" exception of the anti-injunction, statute, then we
must overrule Younger and its companion cases insofar
as they recognized the permissibility of injunctive -relief
against pending criminal prosecutions in certain limited and exceptional circumstances. For, under the doctrine-of Atlantic Coast Line, the anti-injunction statute
would, in a §.-1983 case, then be an "absolute prohibition" against federal equity intervention in'a pending
tate criminal or civil proceeding-under any circumstances Whatever..
The-Atlantic Coast Line and Younger cases thus serve
to -delineate both. the importance and the finality of the
question now before us. And it is in the shadow of
those cases that. the question must be decided.
III
The anti-injunction statute goes back almost to the
beginnings of our history as a Nation. In 1793, Congress enacted a law providing that no."writ of injunction be granted [by any federal court] to stay proceedings

in any court of a state...." Act of March 2, 1793;
1 Stat. 335. The precise origins of the legislation are
shrouded in obscurity," but the consistent understand10 "The history of this provision in the Judiciary Act of 1793 is
not fully known. We know that on December 31, 1790, Attorney
General Edmund Randolph reported to the House of Representatives on desirable changes in the Judiciary Act of 1789. Am. State
Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 17, pp. 21-36' The most serious question
raised by Randolph concerned the arduousness of the -circuit duties
imposed on the Supreme Court justices. But the Report also suggested a number of amendments dealing with procedural matters.
A section of the proposed bill submitted by him provided that 'no
injunction in equity shall be granted by a district court to a judgment at law of a State court.' Id., p. 26. Randolph explained that
this clause 'will debar the district court from. interfering with the
judgments at. law in the State courts; for if the plaintiff and defendant rely upon the State courts, as far as the judgment, they
ought to continue there a. they have begun. It is enough to split
the same §uit into one' at law, and another in equity, without adding
a further separation, by throwing the common law side of the question. into the State courts, and the equity side into the federal
courts.' Id., p. 34. The Report was considered by the House sitting
as a Committee of the Whole, and then was referred to successive
special, committees for further consideration. No action was •taken
until after Chief Justice Jay and his associates wrote the President
that their circuit-riding duties were too burdensome. American
State Papers, Misc., vol. 1, No. 32, p. "51. In response to this complaint, which was transmitted to Congress, the Act of March 2,
1793, was passed, containing in § 5, inter alia, the prohibition against
staying state court proceedings.
"Charles Warren in his article Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 347, suggests that this provision was
the direct consequence of Randolph's report. This.sedtas doubtful,
in view of the very narrow purpose of Randolph's proposal, namely,
that federal courts of equity should not interfere with the enforcement of judgments at law rendered in the state courts. See Taylor
and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in
State Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1171, n. 14.

"There is no record of any debates over the statute. See 3 Annals
of Congress (1791-93). It has been'suggested that 'the provision
reflected the then strong feeling against the unwarranted intrusion

ing has been that its basic purpose is to prevent "needless friction between state and federal courts." Oklahoma
Packing Co. v. Gas Co., 309 U. S. 4, 9. The law remained unchanged until 1874, when it was amended
to permit a federal court to stay state court proceedings
that interfered with the administration of a federal
bankruptcy proceeding.1 1

The present wording of the

legislation was adopted with the enactment of Title 28
of the United States Code in 1948.
Despite the seemingly uncompromising language. of
the anti-injunction statute prior to 1948, the.Court soon
of federal courts upon state sovereignty. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2
Dall. 419, was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks
before the provision was enacted into law. The significance of this
proximity is doubtful. Compare Warren, Federal and State Court
Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 347-348, with Gunter v. Atlantic
Coast Line R. Co., 200, U. S. 273, 291-292. Much more probable is
the suggestion that the provision reflected the prevailing prejudices
against equity jurisdiction. The Journal of William Maclay (1927
•ed.), chronicling the proceedings of the Senate while he was one of
its members (1789-1791), contains abundant evidence of a widespread hostility to chancery practice. See especially, pp. 92-94,
101-06 (debate on the bill that became Judiciary Act of 1789).
Moreover, Senator Ellsworth (soon to become Chief Justice of the
United States), the principal draftsman of both the 1789 and 1793
Judiciary "Acts, often indicated a dislike for equity jurisdiction.

court proceedings when the plaintiff in the federal court
is the United States itself, or a federal agency asserting "superior federal interests." 20
In Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U. S. 118, the
Court in 1941 issued an opinion casting considerable
doubt upon the approach to the anti-injunction statute
reflected in its previous decisions. The Court's opinion
expressly disavowed the "relitigation" exception to the
statute, and emphasized generally the importance of
recognizing the statute's basic directive "of 'hands off'
by* the federal courts in .the use of the injunction to
stay litigation in a state court." 314 U. S., at 132.
The congressional response to Toucey was the enactment in 1948 of the anti-injunction statute in its present
form in 28 U. S. C. § 2283, which, as the Reviser's Note
makes evident, served not only to overrule the specific
holding of Toucey,2' but to restore "the basic law as
generally understood and interpreted prior to the Toucey

decision."

22

We proceed, then, upon the understanding that in
determining whether §.1983 comes within the "expressly
authorized" exception of the anti-injunction statute, the
20Leiter Minerals Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S. 220; NLRB v.
Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138.
21 The Reviser's Note states in part: "The exceptions specifically
include the words 'to protect or effectuate its judgments,' for lack of
which the Supreme Court held that the Federal courts are without
power to enjoin relitigation of cases and controversies fully adjudicated by such courts. (See Toucey v. New York Life Insurance
Co., . . . 314 U. S. 118 ...... A vigorous dissenting opinion [314
U. S, 141] notes that at the timre of the 1911 revision of the Judicial
Code, the power of the courts . . . of the United States to protect
their judgments was unquestioned and that the revisers of that code
noted no change and Congress intended no change." H. R. Rep.
No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., -A181-182 (1947).
22 Ibid.

MITCHUM v. FOSTER
225

Opinion of the Court

criteria to be applied are those reflected in the Court's
decisions prior to Toucey.11 A. review of those decisions makes reasonably clear what the relevant criteria
are. In the first place, it is evident that, in order to
qualify under the "expressly authorized" exception of
the anti-injunction statute, a federal-law need not contain an express reference to that statute. As the Court
has said, "no prescribed formula. is required; an authorization' need not expressly refer to § 2283." Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348
U. S. 511, 516. Indeed, none of the previously
recognized statutory exceptions contains any such reference. 24 Secondly, a federal law need not expressly authorize an injunction of a state court proceeding in
order to qualify as an exception. Three of the six previously recognized statutory exceptions contain no such
authorization. 5" Thirdly, it is clear that, in order to
qualify as an "expressly authorized" exception to the
anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have
created a specific and uniquely federal right or remedy,
enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could
be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a state court proceeding. This is not

See nn. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, supra.

25 See nn. 12,. 13, and 17, supra. The federal courts have found

that other Acts of Congress that do not refer to § 2283 or to injunctions against state court proceedings nonetheless come within
the "expressly authorized" language of the anti-injunction statute.

to say that in-order to come within the exception an
Act of Congress must, on its face and in every one of
its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute."8 The test,, rather, is
whether an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal
right or remedy enforceable in a federal: court of equity,
could be given its intended scope only. by the stay of a
state court "proceeding. See Toucey, supra, at 132-134;

of 42 U. S. C. § 1983.

ly
Section 1983 was originally § 1 of the Civil Rights
Act of 1871. 17 Stat. 13. It was •"modeled" (in § 2
of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14'Stat. 27'21 and.was
enacted for the express purpose of "enforc[ing] the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment."- 17 Stat. 13.
The predecessor of § 1983 was thus an important part
of the basic alteration in our federal system wrought
in the Reconstruction era through federal legislation
and constitutional amendment.2 1 As a result of the

As Representative Shellabarger stated, the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 "not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former
condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where,
under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of
rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason
and virtue of their national citizenship." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong.,
1st Sess., App. 68 (1871). And as Representative Hoar stated: "The.
principal danger that menaces us to-day is from the effort within
the States to deprive considerable numbers of persons of the civil

OCTOBER TERM, 1971

It is clear from the legislative debates surrounding
passage of § 1983's predecessor that the Act was intended to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth
Amendment "against State action,... whether that action
be executive, legislative, or judicial." Ex parte Virginia,
100 U. S. 339, 346 (emphasis supplied). Proponents
of the legislation noted that state Courts were being
used to harass and injure individuals, either because
the state courts were powerless to stop deprivations or
were in league with those who were bent upon abrogation of federally protected'rights.
As Representative Lowe stated, the "records of the
[state] tribunals are searched in vain for evidence of
effective redress [of federally secured rights] .... What
less than this [the Civil Rights Act of 1871] will afford
an adequate remedy? The Federal Government cannot serve a writ of mandamus -upon State Executives
or upon State courts. to compel them to protect the
rights, privileges and immunities of citizens .... The
case has arisen ... when the Federal Government mustresort to its own agencies to carry its own authority
into execution. Hence this bill throws open the doors
of the United States courts to:those whose rights under
the Constitution are denied or impaired." Cong. Globe,
42d Cong., 1st Sess., 374-376 (1871).. This view was
echoed by Senator Osborn: "If the State courts had
proven themselves competent to suppress the local disand equal rights which the General Government is endeavoring to
secure to them." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess. 335.
Although, as originally drafted in 1871, § 1983's predecessor protected rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution,
the provision included by the Congress in the Revised Statutes. of
1874 was enlarged to provide protection for rights, privileges, or
immunities secured by federal law as well. Rev. Stat. § 1979.

Those who opposed-the Act of 1871 clearly recognized
that- the proponents were extending federal power in
an attempt to remedy the state courts' failure to secure
federal tights. The debate was not about whether the

courts, but whether this innovation, was necessary or
desirable."
This legislative history makes evident that Congress
clearly conceived that it was altering the relationship
between the States and the Nation with respect to the
protection of federally created rights; it was concerned
that state instrumentalities could not protect those
rights; it realized that state officers might, in fact, be
antipathetic to the vindication of those rights; and it
believed that these failings extended to the state courts.
V
Section 1983 was thus a product of a vast transformation from the concepts of federalism that had
prevailed in the late 18th century when the antiinjunction statute was enacted., The very purpose of
§ 1983 was to interpose the federal courts between the
States and the people, as guardians of the people's
federal. rights-to protect the people from unconstitutional action under color of state law, "whether that
action be executive, legislative, or judicial.".:. Ex parte
Virginia, 100 U. S., at 346. In carrying out that purpose, Congress plainly authorized the federal courts
to issue injunctions in- § 1983 actions, by expressly authorizing a "suit in',equity" as one of the means of redress. And this Court long ago recognized that federal
injunctive relief against a state court proceeding can
in some circumstances be essential to prevent great,
immediate, and irreparable loss of a person's constitutional rights. Ex parte Y.oung, 209 U. S. 123; cf. Truaxv. Raich, 239 U. S. 33; Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U S.
479. For these reasons we conclude that, under the

385 (Rep. Lewis); 416 (Rep. Biggs); 429 (Rep. McHenry); App.

criteria established in our previous decisions construing
the anti-injunction statute, § 1983 is an Act of Congress
that falls within the "expressly authorized" exception of
that law.
In so concluding, we do not question or qualify in
any way the principles of equity, comity, and federalism
that must restrain a federal court when asked to enjoin
a state court proceeding. These principles, in the context of state criminal prosecutions, were canvassed at
length last Term in Younger v. Harris,401 U. S. 37, and
its companion cases. They are principles that have been
emphasized by this Court many times in the past. Fenner. v. Boykin, 271 U. S. 240; Spielman Motor Sales
Co. v. Dodge, 295 U. S. 89; Beal V. Missouri Pac. R.
Co., 312 U. S.-45; Watson v. Buck, 313.U. S. 387; Williams v. Miller, 317 U. S. 599; Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157,; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S.
117; Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U. S. 611. Today we
decide only that the District Court. in this case was in
error in holding that, because of the anti-injunction
statute, it was absolutely without power in this § 1983
action to enjoin, a proceeding pending in a state court
under any circumstances whatsoever.
The judgment is reversed and the case 'is remanded
to the District Court for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

only that 28 U. S. C. § 2283, which is an absolute bar
to injunctions against state court proceedings in most
suits, does not apply to a suit brought under 42 U. S. 'C.
§ 1983 seeking an injunction of state proceedings. But,
as the Court's opinion has noted, it does. nothing to
"question or qualify in any way the principles of equity,
comity, and federalism that must restrain a federal court
when asked to enjoin a state court proceeding." Ante,
at 243. In the context of pending state criminal proceedings, we held in Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37
.(1971), that these principles allow a federal court properly to issue an injunction in only a narrow class of
circumstances. We have not yet reached or decided
exactly how great a restraint is imposed by these principles on a federal court.asked to enjoin state civil proceedings. Therefore, on remand in this case, it seems
to me the District Court, before reaching a decision on
the merits of appellant's claim, should properly consider
whether general notions of equity or principles of federalism, similar to those invoked in Younger, -prevent
the issuance of. an injunction against the state "nuisance
abatement" proceedings in the circumstances of this case.
