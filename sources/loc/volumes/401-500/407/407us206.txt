ON BILL OF COMPLAINT

No. 40, Orig.

Argued March 29, 1972-Decided June 19, 1972

Pennsylvania brought this original action against New York to determine the autlhority of States to escheat, or take custody of,
unclaimed funds paid to Western Union Telegraph Co. for purchase of money orders. The' Special Master, following Tezas v.
New Jersey, 379 U. S. 674, recommended that any sum held by
Western Union unclaimed for the time period prescribed by state
statute may be escheated or taken into custody by the State in
which the company's records placed the creditor's address, whether
the creditor be the payee of an unpaid draft, the sender of a money
order entitled to a refund, or an individual whose claim has been
erroneously underpaid; and where the records show no address,
or where the State in which the creditor's address falls has no
applicable escheat law, the right to escheat or- take custody shall
be in the debtor's domiciliary State, here New York. The recommended decree is adopted and entered, and the cause is remanded
to the Special Master for a proposed supplemental decree with
respect to the distribution of the costs to the States of the inquiry
as to available addresses. Pp. 208-216.

rule the exceptions and enter the decree recommended
by the Special Master, see post, p. 223.1
The nature of Western Union's money order business,
and the source of the funds here in dispute, were described by the Court in Western Union Telegraph Co. v.
Pennsylvania, 368 U. S. 71 (1961):
"Western Union is a corporation chartered under
New York law with its principal place of business

in that State. It also does business and has offices
in all the other States except Alaska and Hawaii, [as
well as] in the District of Columbia, and in foreign
countries and was from 1916 to 1934 subject to regulation by the I. C. C. and since then by the F. C. C.
In addition to sending telegraphic messages throughout its world-wide system, it carries on a telegraphic
money order business which commonly works like
this. A sender goes to a Western Union office, fills

out an application and gives it to the company clerk
who waits on him together with the money to be sent
and the charges for sending it. A receipt is given the
sender and a telegraph message is transmitted to the
company's office nearest to the payee directing that
office to pay the money order to the payee. The
payee is then notified and upon properly identifying
himself is given a negotiable draft, which he can
either endorse and cash at once or keep for use in the
future. If the payee cannot be located for delivery
of the notice, or fails to call for the draft within
72 hours, the Office of destination notifies the sending
office. This office then notifies the original sender
of the failure to deliver and makes a refund, as it
The exception of Indiana as to a typographical error in the recom-

mended decree is sustained. The phrase "escheat of custodial taking" in paragraph 2, lines 4-5 of the decree should read "escheat
or custodial taking."

makes payments to payees, by way of a negotiable
draft which may be either cashed immediately or
kept for use in the future.
"In the thousands of money order transactions
carried on by the company, it sometimes happens
that it can neither make payment to the payee nor
make a refund to the sender. Similarly payees and
senders who accept drafts as payment or refund
sometimes fail to cash them. For this reason large
sums of money due from Western Union for un.delivered money orders and unpaid' drafts accumulate over the years in the company's offices and bank
accounts throughout the country." Id., at 72-73.
In 1953 Pennsylvania began state proceedings under
its escheat statute4 to take custody of those unclaimed
funds, held by'Western .Union, that arose from money
order purchases in the company's Pennsylvania offices.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed a judgment for the State of about $40,000, Commonwealth v.
Western Union, 400 Pa. 337, 162 A. 2d 617 (1960), but this
Court reversed, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, 'holding that the state court judgment
denied Western Union due process of law because it could
not protect the company against rival claims of other
States. We noted that controversies among different

States over their right to escheat intangibles could be settled only in a forum "where all the States that want to do
so can present their claims for consideration and final,
authoritative determination. Our Court has jurisdiction
to do that." Id., at 79.
Thereafter, in Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U. S. 674
(1965), the Court was asked to decide which of several
States was entitled to escheat intangible property consisting of debts owed by the Sun Oil Co. and left
unclaimed by creditors. Four different rules were proposed. Texas argued that the funds should go to the
State having the most significant "contacts" with the
debt, as measured by a number of factors; New Jersey,
that they should go to the State of the debtor company's
incorporation; Pennsylvania, to the State where the
company had its principal place of business; and Florida,
to the State of the creditor's last known address as shown
by the debtor's books and records. We rejected Texas'
and Pennsylvania's proposals as being. too uncertain and
difficult to administer, and rejected New Jersey's because "it would too greatly exalt a minor factor to permit
escheat of obligations incurred all over the country by
the State in which the debtor happened to incorporate
itself." Id., at 680. Florida's proposal, on the other
hand, was regarded not only as a "simple and easy" standard to follow, but also as one that tended "to distribute
escheats among thq States in the proportion of the commercial activities of their residents." Id., at 681. We
therefore held that the State of the creditor's last known
address is entitled to escheat the property owed him,
adding that if his address does not appear on the debtor's
books or is in a State that does not provide for escheat
of intangibles, then the State of the debtor's incorporation may take custody of the funds "until some other

206

Opinion of the Court

State comes forward with proof that it has a superior

right to escheat." Id., at 682. The opinion concluded:
"We realize that this case could have been resolved
otherwise, for the issue here is not controlled by
statutory or constitutional provisions or by past
decisions, nor is it entirely one of logic. It is fundamentally a question of ease of administration and of
equity. We believe that the iule we adopt is the
fairest, is easy to apply, and in the long run will be

the most generally acceptable to all the States." Id.,
at 683.
On March 13, 1970, Pennsylvania filed this original
action to renew its efforts to escheat part of Western
Union's unclaimed money order proceeds. The complaint
alleged that Western Union had accumulated more than
$1,500,000 in unclaimed funds "on account of money
orders purchased from the company on or before December 31, 1962," and that about $100,000 of that amount,
"held by Western Union on account of money orders purchased from it in Pennsylvania," was subject to escheat
by that State. Pennsylvania. asked for a judgment resolving the conflicting claims of it and the defendant
States, and for a temporary injunction against payment
of the funds by Western Union or a taking of them by the

defendant States, pending disposition of the case. 5
In their arguments before the Special Master, the
parties suggested three different formulas to resolve their

conflicting claims. Pennsylvania contended that Western
Union's money order records do not identify anyone as
a "creditor" of the company and in many instances do
SThe -Court has taken no. action on the plea for temporary injunction, and accepts the recommendation of the Special Master that
it now "be denied as unnecessary."

not list an address for either the sender or payee; therefore, strict application of the Texas v. New Jersey rule
to this type of intangible would result in the escheat of
almost all the funds to the State of incorporation, here
New York. To avoid this result, Pennsylvania proposed
that the State where the money order was purchased be
permitted to take the funds. It claimed that the State
where the money orders are bought should be presumed
to be the State of the sender's residence. Connecticut,
California, and Indiana supported this proposal, as did
New Jersey as amicus curiae.
Florida and Arizona also supported Pennsylvania, but
argued that where the payee had received but not cashed
the money order, his address, if known, should determine
escheat, regardless of the sender's address.
New York argued that Texas v. New Jersey should be
strictly applied, but that it was not retroactive. Thus,
as to money orders purchased between 1930 and 1958
(seven years before the Texas decision) 6 New York asserted its right as the State of incorporation to all unclaimed funds, regardless of the creditor's address.! As
for money orders drawn after 1958, New York would apply the Texas rule, and take the funds in all cases where
the creditor's address did not appear or was located in a
State not providing: for escheat.
The Special Master has submitted a report recommending that the Texas rule "be applied to all the items
involved in this case regardless of the date of the transoNew York makes no claim with respect to money orders issued
before 1930.
Section 1309 of New York's Abandoned Property Law provides
for the custodial taking, not escheat, of uncashed money orders, so'
that "the rights of a holder of a... money order to payment.., shall
be in no wise affected, impaired or enlarged by reason of the provisions of this section or by reason of the payment to the state comptroller of abandoned property hereunder."

actions out of which. they arose." Report 21. The Report expresses some doubt about the constitutionality of
the suggested alternatives, stating that. both the placeof-purchase and place-of-destination rules might permit
intangible property rights to be "cut off or adversely
affected by state action in an in rem proceeding in a
forum having no continuing relationship to any of the
parties to the proceedings." Id., at 19. These doubts,
however, were not the sole basis for the Special Master's
recommendation. He found that "[a]s in the case of the
obligations in [Texas v. New Jersey], [the Texas] .rule
presents an easily administered standard preventing multiple claims and giving all parties a fixed rule on which
they can rely." Id., at 20. -le concluded that:
"Any sum now held by Western Union unclaimed
for the period of time prescribed by the applicable
State statutes may be escheated or taken into custody by the State in which the records of Western
Union placed the address of the creditor, whether
that creditor be the payee of an unpaid draft, the
sender of a money order entitled to a refund, or an
individual whose claim has been underpaid through
error. .-. . [I]f no address is contained in the records of Western Union, or if the State in which the
address of the creditor falls has no applicable escheat
law, then the right to escheat or take custody shall
be in the domiciliary State of the debtor, in this
case, New York." Id., at 20-21.
The Report also states that New York would bear the
burden of establishing "as to all escheatable items the
absence from Western Union's records of -an address for
the creditor." Id., at 16.
Pennsylvania's exceptions argue -that where a transaction is of a type that "the obligor does not, make entries
upon its books and records showing the address of the

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
Opinion of the Court

407 U. S.

obligee," only "the State of origin of the transaction"
should be permitted to escheat. Florida and Arizona
have abandoned their state-of-destination test, and together with the other participating States save New
York, have joined in Pennsylvania's exceptions. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 20, 42.
Pennsylvania's proposal has some surface appeal. Because Western Union does not regularly record the addresses of its money order creditors, it is likely that
the corporate domicile will receive a much larger share
of the, unclaimed funds here than in the case of other
obligations, like bills for services rendered, where such
records are kept as a matter of business practice. In a
sense, there is some inconsistency between that result
and our refusal in Texas to make the debtor's domicile
the primary recipient of unclaimed intangibles. Furthermore, the parties say, the Texas rule is nothing more than
a legal presumption that the creditor's residence is in
the State of his last known address. A presumption
based on the place of purchase is equally valid, they
argue, and should be applied in order to prevent New
York from gaining this windfall.
Assuming, without resolving the doubts expressed by
the Special Master, that the Pennsylvania rule provides
a constitutional basis for escheat, we do not regard the
likelihood of a "windfall" for New Yqrk as a sufficient
reason for carving out this- exception to the Texas rule.
Texas v. New Jersey was not grounded on the assumption that all creditors' addresses are known. Indeed, as
to four of the eight classes of debt ilvolved in that case,
the Court expressly found that some of the creditors "had
no last address indicated." 379 U. S., at 675-676, n. 4.
Thus, the only arguable basis for distinguishing money
orders is that they involve a higher percentage of unknown addresses. But we are not told what percentage

PENNSYLVANIA v. NEW YQM
206

Opinion of the Court

is high enough to justify an exception to the Texas rule,
nor is it entirely clear that money orders constitute the
only form of transaction where the percentage of unknown addresses may run high. In other words, to vary
the application of the Texas rule according to the adequacy of the debtor's records would require this Court
to do precisely what we said should be avoided-that is,
"to decide each escheat case on the basis of its particular
facts or to devise new rules of law to apply to everdeveloping new categories of facts." Texas v. New
Jersey, 379 U. S., at 679.
Furthermore, a substantial number of creditors' addresses may in fact be available in this case. Although
Western Union has not kept ledger records of addresses,
the parties stipulated, and the Special Master found,
that money order applications have been retained in the
company's records "as fat back as 1930 in some instances
and are generally available since 1941." Report 9. -To
the extent that creditor addresses are available from
those forms, the "windfall" to New York will, of course,
be diminished.
We think that as a matter of fairness the claimant
States, and not Western Union, should bear the cost
of finding and recording the available addresses, and
we shall remand to the Special Master for a hearing
and recommendation as to the appropriate formula for
distributing those costs. As for future money order
transactions, nothing we say here prohibits the States
from requiring Western Union to keep adequate address
records. The decree rec.,mended by the Special Master
is adopted and entered, and the cause is remanded to the

The majority opinion today purports to apply the rule
laid down in Texas v. New Jersey, 379 U. S. 674 (1965),
to a fact situation not contemplated when that case was
decided. In applying that .rule to these new facts, it
seems to me that the Court exalts-the rule but derogates
the reasons supporting it.
I
Texas v. New Jersey, a case decided within the Court's
original jurisdiction, is a unique precedent. Disposition
of that case necessarily required a departure from the
Court's usual mode of decisionmaking. Our role in this
country's scheme of government is ordinarily a restricted
one, limited in large measure to the resolution of conflicts calling for the interpretation and application either
of statutory acts or of provisions of the Federal Constitution. In the 'performance of this function, an individual Justice's views as to what he might consider
"fair" or "equitable" or "expeditious" are largely immaterial. Infrequently, however, we are called on to
resolve disputes arising under the original jurisdiction of
the Court (Art. III, ยง 2) in which our judgment is unaided by statutory or constitutional directives.
In approaching such cases, we may find, as did the

PENNSYLVANIA v. NEW YORK.
206

POWELL,

J., diss.enting

Court in Texas v. New Jersey, that fairness and expeditiousness provide the guideposts for our decision:
"[T]he issue here is not controlled by statutory or
constitutional provisions or by past decisions, nor
is it entirely one of logic. It is fundamentally a
question of ease of administration and of equity."
Id., at 683.
The case before us today requires the application of similar principles, and I agree that Mr.. Justice Black's opinion in Texas v. New Jersey points the way to the most
desirable result. In my view, however, the majority's
application of that precedent to the facts of this case
offends both the "fairness" and "ease of administration"
bases of that opinion.
The Court in Texas v. New Jersey was asked to decide
which States could take title to escheatable intangible
personal property in the form of debts owed by Sun
Oil Co. to a large number of individual creditors.
After rejecting several alternatives offered by the parties,
the Court adopted the rule proposed by the State of
Florida and approved by the Special Master. Under that
rule the power to escheat the debts in question, in the
first instance, was to be accorded "to the State of the
creditor's last known address as shown by the debtor's
books and records." Id., at 680-681. In the "infrequent" case in which no record of last address was available or in which the appropriate State's laws did not
provide for the escheat of abandoned intangibles, the
property was to go to the State of the debtor's corporate
domicile. Id., at 682
This disposition recommended itself to the CQrt for
several reasons. The rule was generally consistent with
the common-law maxim "mobilia sequuntur personam"*
*Sl Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, 9-10 (1928).

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
POWELL, J., dissenting

407 U. S.

under which intangible personal property may be found to
follow the domicile of its owner-here the creditor. Id., at
680 n. 10. In looking to the residence of the creditor,
the rule adopted by the Court recognized that, the Company's unclaimed debts were assets of the individual
creditors rather than- assets of the debtor. Id., at 681.
Also, in distributing the property among the creditors'
States, the rule had the advantage of dividing the property in a manner roughly proportionate to the commercial activities of each State's residents. In using the
last-known address as the sole indicator of domicile, the
rule would be easy to administer and apply. The Court
recognized, of course, that this approach might lead to
the escheat of property to a State from which the creditor
had removed himself in the period since the debt arose.
Yet it concluded that these instances would "tend to a
large extent to cancel each other out," and would .not
disrupt the basic fairness and expeditiousness of the result. Id., at 681.
Paradoxically, the mechanistic application of the Texas
v. New Jersey rule to the present case leads ultimately to
the defeat of each of the beneficial justifications for that
rule. Unlike the records of the numerous debts owed
by Sun Oil, Western Union's records may reflect the
creditors' addresses for-only a relatively small percentage
of the transactions. As a consequence, the greater portion of the entire Western Union fund will go to the
State of New York-the State of corporate domicile.
Effectively then, the obligation of the debtor will be converted into an asset of the debtor's State of domicile to
the exclusion of the creditors' States. The Court in
Texas v. New Jersey specifically repudiated this result on
the ground that it was inconsistent with "principles of
fairness." Id., at 680. It would have "exalt[ed] a minor
factor to permit escheat of obligations incurred all over
the country by the State in which the aebtor happened

was willing to permit-this result in the few casesin which
no record- of. address was available. or.,in which ,no. law

the, Court that this result would be impermissible ,as a
basis for disposing of more than a small minority of the
debts. 'Yet the decision today ignores the Court's 'un.willingness ,to "exalt" theAlargely coincidental domicile
of -the corporate debtor. -Italso disregards the Court's
clearly expressed intent ,that the. escheatable property be
distributed in proportions roughly. comparable to the volume of transactionsconducted in each State.
Fu4thermore, the rule today. is incompatible with the
Court's view in Texas v.New .Jersey that an easily.and.
inexpensively discernible mode of allocation be utilized;

available money order application to determine whether.

$175,000.- Report of theSpecial, Master 16.
In 'sum,the invocation of the Texas v. New Jersey rule
in the manner -contemn4plated by the majority will lead
to a iesult that is neither expeditious nor equitable.
ii
The reasons underlying Texas v. New Jersey could best
be effectuated by a relatively minor but'logical deviation
in the manner in which that rule is implemented in this
case. Rather than embarking upon. a potentially fruitless -search for the creditor's last-known address as a
rough indicator .of domicile, reliance should be placed
upon the State where the debtor-creditor relationship-was

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
POWELL, J., dissenting

407 U, S.

established. In most cases that State is likely also to
be the site of the creditor's domicile. In other words,
in the case of money orders sent and, then returned to
the initiating Western Union office because the sendee
failed to claim the money, the State in which. the money
order was purchased may be presumed to be the State
of the purmhaser-creditor's domicile. And, where the
draft has been received by either the initiating party or
by the recipient but not negotiated, the State in which
the draft was issued may be assumed to be the State of
that creditor's domicile,
This modification is preferable, first, because it preserves the equitable foundation of the Texas- v. New
Jersey rule. The State of the corporate debtor's domicile is denied a "windfall"; the fund is divided in a
proportion approximating the volume, of transactions
occurring in each State; and the integrity of the notion
that these amounts represent assets of the individual
purchasers or recipients of money ordes is maintained.
Secondly, the relevant information would be more easily
obtainable. The place of purchase and the office of
destination are reflected in Western Union's ledger books
and it would, therefore, be unnecessary to examine, the
innumerable application forms themselves. Since the
'ledgers are more readily available, the allocation of the
fund would be effected at less expense than would be
required by the majority's resolution.
Despite these advantages, the. Speci.l Master rejected
this alternative. He reasoned that an undetermined
number of these transactions must have taken place
outside the crdditors' State of domicile. Specifically, he
cited the cases in which a New Jersey or. Connecticut
resident might -purchase a -money order in Nev York,
or" cases in which a resident of Virginia or Maryland
might make his purchase in the District of Columbia.
Report of the Special Master '18. While such cases

โขPENNSYLVANIA v. NEW YORK

206

PowELL,

J., dissenting

certainly exist, they are merely exceptions to a'generally
reliable rule that money order purchases are likely to
have occurred within the(State of the purchaser's domicile. That perfection is not achieved is no reason to
reject this alternative. The Texas v. New Jersey Court
recognized that absolute fairness was not obtainable and
that the most that could be expected was a rule providing a reasonable approximation. Id., at 681 n. 11. Certainly this objection should not be allowed to frustrate
the better alternative in favor of one that is less fair
and more difficult to administer.
III
-The majority opinion intimates, as I think it must,
that the ultimate consequence of its decision today is
inconsistent (ante, at 214) with the result in Texas v.
New Jersey. While the opinion appears to recognize
that New York will reap the very "windfall" that Texas
v. New Jersey sought to ivoid, its refusal to bend in the
face of this consequence goes largely unexplained. Apparently, the basis for its decision is the conviction -that
the Court's -prior' precedent was designed to settle the
question of escheat of intangible personal property "once
and for all." Id., at 678. The majority adheres to the
existing rule because of some apprehension that flexibility in this case will deprive the. Court of a satisfactory
test for the resolution of future cases. The opinion anticipates that departure from Texas v. New Jersey will
leave other cases to be decided on an ad hoc basis, de.:pending in each case on the "adequacy of the debtor's
records." Ante, at 215. ,,Although the factual circumstances of future cases cannot be predicted, it is likely
that most of such cases can be resolved within the principles of Texas v. New Jersey. The factual range is.
limited. The debtor either will or will not maintain
creditors' addresses in the ordinary course of business.

PowELL, J.,. dissenting

407 U. S.

In some categories of transactions, such as those involving money orders and traveler's checks, adequate address
records may not be available. In the case of ordinary
corporate debts, however, it is more likely that records
will be available. Moreover,, as the majority points
out, any State is free to require corporations doing busihess in that State to maintain records of their creditors'
addresses. Ante, at 215.
In short, the threat of frequent and complicated cases
in this area seems remote. It provides little j ustifica tion for the majority's Cinderella-like compulsion to
accommodate this ill-fitting precedential "slipper."
From a result that seems both inflexible and inequitable,
I dissent.
