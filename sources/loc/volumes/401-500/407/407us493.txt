PETERS v. KIFF, WARDEN
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE FIFTH CIRCUIT
No. 71-5078.

Argued February 22, 1972-Decided June 22, 1972

Petitioner contends in this habeas corpus proceeding that the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury that indicted him
and the petit jury that convicted himdeprived him of his rights to
due process and equal protection. The Court of Appeals affirmed
the District Court's denial of relief on the ground that petitioner,
not being a Negro, suffered no unconstitutional discrimination.
Held: The judgment is reversed. Pp. 495-507.
441 F. 2d 370, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by MR. JUSTICE DouqLAs and
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concluded that:
1. Petitioner, under the circumstances of thiis case, has not
abandoned his challenge to the petit jury by failing to include it
in the list of questions presented by the writ of certiorari. Pp.
495-496.
2. A State cannot, consistent with due process, subject a defendant to indictment by a grand jury or trial by a petit jury
that has been selected in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner
contrary to federal constitutional and statutory requirements, and
regardless of any showing of actual bias, petitioner had standing
to attack the systematic exclusion of Negroes from grand jury and
petit jury service. Pp. 496-505.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, joined by MR.JUSTICE BREN1NAN and MR.
JUSTICE POWELL, would implement the longstanding and strong
policy of 18 U. S. C. ยง 243 against excluding qualified jurors on
account of race by permitting petitioner to challenge his conviction on the ground that Negroes were arbitrarily excluded from the
grand jury that indicted him. Hill v. Texas, 316 U. S.'400. Pp.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL announced the judgment of
the Court and an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS
and MR. JUSTICE STEWART join.

Petitioner alleges that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted him and the
petit jury that convicted him of burglary in the Superior
Court of Muscogee County, Georgia. In consequence he
contends that his conviction is invalid under the Due
Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment. Because he is not himself a Negro, the
respondent contends that he has not suffered any unconstitutional discrimination, and that his conviction" must
stand. On that ground, the Court of Appeals affirmed
the denial of his petition for federal habeas corpus. 441
F. 2d 370- (CA5 1971).1 We granted certiorari. 404
U. S. 964 (1971). We reverse.
1 The

history of this litigation is long and complicated. Petitioner was indicted on June 6, 1966. His first trial resulted in a
conviction that was reversed on Fourth Amendment grounds, 114
Ga. App. 595, 152 S. E. 2d 647 (1966). A second trial, held on
December 8, 1966, resulted in the conviction challenged here,

Opinion of

MARSHALL, J.

I
At the outset, we reject the contention that the only
issue before this Court is petitioner's challenge to the
composition of the grand jury that indicted him. The
respondent argues that the challenge to the petit jury is
not before us, because it fails to appear in the list of questions presented by the petition for certiorari. We do not
regard that omission as controlling, however, in light of
the fact that the two claims have been treated together at
every stage of'the proceedings below, they are treated
together in the body of the petition for certiorari, and
they are treated together in the brief filed by petitioner
on- the merits in this Court. Petitioner cannot fairly be
said to have o.andoned his challefnge to the petit jury,
and the State has had ample opportunity to respond to
that challenge, having done so at length below.2
Moreover, in this case the principles governing the two
claims are identical. First, it appears that the same
selection process was used for both the grand jury and
which was affirmed, 115 Ga. App. 743, 156 S. E. 2d 195 (1967).
Petitioner for the first time raised the claim of discriminatory
jury selection in a petition for federal habeas corpus, which was
summarily denied on July 5, 1967. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that petitioner had failed to exhaust thenavailable state remedies with respect to his otherwise highly colorable claim, 397 F. 2d 731, 735-741 (CA5 1968). Petitioner then
filed a second petition for federal habeas corpus on the same ground,
alleging that intervening state court decisions clearly foreclosed his
claim in the state courts. That petition was denied on the grounds
(1) that it was repetitious, (2) that petitioner had failed to exhaust,
and (3) that his claims were lacking in merit. App. 15. The Court
of Appeals again affirmed, rejecting the first two grounds and resting
entirely on the third, i. e., rejecting petitioner's substantive claims.
441 F. 2d 370 (1971). The exhaustion point thus having been resolved in petitioner's favor below, the State quite properly does not
press it here.

the petit jury.'
Consequently, the question whether
jurors were in fact excluded on the basis of race will be
answered the same way for both tribunals. Second, both
the grand jury and the petit jury in this case must be
measured solely by the general Fourteenth Amendment
guarantees of due process and equal protection, and not
by the specific constitutional provisions for the grand
jury and the petit jury. For the Fifth Amendment right
to a grand jury does not apply in a state prosecution.
Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884). And the
Sixth Amendment right to a petit jury, made applicable
to the States through the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment in Duncanv. Louisiana,391 U. S.
145 (1968), does not apply to state trials that took place
before the decision in Duncan, as petitioner's trial did.
De Stefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631 (1968). Accordingly,
we turn now to the commands of equal protection and
of due process.
This Court has never before considered a white defendant's challenge to the exclusion of Negroes from
jury service. 4 The essence of petitioner's claim is this:
3
The jury lists were made up from the tax digests, which were
by law segregated according to race; moreover, the jury lists contained a proportion of Negroes much smaller than the proportion in
the population or in the tax digests. The jury-selection system of
Muscogee County, Georgia, was explored in detail and struck down as

unconstitutional in Vanleeward v. Rutledge, 369 F. 2d 584 (CA5
.1966), contemporaneously with petitioner's trial. On petitioner's first
federal appeal, the Court of Appeals suggested, though it did not
hold, that the Vanleeward findings and conclusions on this point
ihould be regarded as conclusive with respect to Peters, and thereby
the expense and delay of a full evidentiary hearing might be avoided,
397 F. 2d, at 740.
'A number of state courts and lower federal courts have imposed
a "same class" rule on challenges to discriminatory jury selection,

holding that the exclusion of a class from jury service is subject to

PETERS v. KIFF

MARSHALL, J.

that the tribunals that indicted and convicted him were
constituted in a manner that is prohibited by the Constitution and by statute; that the impact of that error
on any individual trial is unascertainable; and that consequently any indictment or conviction returned by such
tribunals
must be set aside.'
There can
be no doubt that, if petitioner's allegations
are true, both tribunals involved in this case were illegally
constituted. He alleges that Negroes were systematically
excluded from both the grand jury and the petit jury.
This Court has repeatedly held that the Constitution
prohibits such selection practices, with respect to the
grand jury,' the petit jury," or both.8 Moreover, Conchallenge only by a member of the excluded class. Only a few courts
have rejected the nile; e. g., Allen v. State, 110 Ga. App. 56, 137 S. E.
2d 711 (1964) (not followed by other panels of same court); State v.
Madison, 240 Md. 265, 213 A. 2d 880 (1965). The cases are collected,
and criticized, in Note, The Defendant's Challenge to a Racial Criterion in Jury Selection, 74 Yale L. J. 919 (1965). Sed-also Note, The
Congress, The Court and Jury Selection, 52 Va. L. Rev. 1069 (1966).
This Court avoided passing on the "same class" rule in Fay v. New
York, 332 U. S. 261, 289-290 (1947), and has never since then approved or rejected it.
5He also claims his own rights under the Equal Protection Clause
have been violated, a claim we need not consider in light of our
disposition.

gress has made it a crime for a public official to exclude
anyone from a grand or petit jury on the basis Of race,
18 U. S. C. ยง 243, and this Court upheld the statute, approving the congressional determination that such exclusion would violate the express prohibitions of the
Equal Protection Clause. Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S.
339 (1880). The crime, and the unconstitutional state
action, occur whether the. defendant is white or Negro,
whether he is acquitted or convicted. In short, when a
grand or petit jury has been selected on an impermissible
basis, the existence of a constitutional violation does not
depend on the circumstances of the person making the
claim.
It is a separate question, however, whether petitioner
is entitled to the relief he seeks on the basis of that con"stitutional violation. Respondent argues that even if the
grand and petit juries were unconstitutionally selected,
petitioner is not entitled to relief on that account because he has not shown how he was harmed by the error.
It is argued that a Negro defendant's right to challenge
the exclusion of Negroes from jury service rests on a presumption that a jury so constituted will be prejudiced
against him; that no such presumption is available to a
white defendant; and consequently that a white defendant must introduce affirmative evidence of actual
harm in order to establish a basis for relief.
That argument takes too narrow a view of the kinds
of harm that flow from discrimination in jury selection.
The exclusion of Negroes from jury service, like the arbitrary exclusion of any other well-defined class of citizens,
offends a number of related constitutional values.
In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308-309
(1880), this Court considered the question from the point
Alabama, 294 U. S. 587 (1935); Martin v. Texas, 200 U. S. 316
(1906); Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370 (1881); Strauder v. West
Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880).

PETERS v. KIFF

of view of the Negro defendant's right to equal protection
of the laws. Strauder was part of a landmark trilogy of
cases, in which this Court first dealt with the problem of
racial discrimination in jury selection. In Strauder itself,
a Negro defendant sought to remove his criminal trial to
the federal courts, pursuant to statute, on the ground
that Negroes were excluded by law from the grand and
petit juries in .the state courts; the Court upheld his
claim. In Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313 (1880), a
Negro defendant sought removal on the ground that
there were in fact no Negroes in the venire from which
his jury was drawn; the Court held that, without more,
his claim did not come within the precise terms of the
removal statute. Finally, in Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S.
339 (1880), a state judge challenged the statute under
which he was convicted for the federal crime of excluding
Negroes from state grand and petit juries; the Court
upheld the statute as a valid means of enforcing the
Equal Protection Clause. Because each of these three
cases was amenable to decision on the narrow basis of
an analysis of the Negro defendant's right to equal protection, the Court brought all three under that single
analytical umbrella.
But even in 1880 the Court recognized that other constitutional values were implicated. In Strauder, the
Court observed that the exclusion of Negroes from jury
service injures not only defendants, but also other members of the excluded class: it denies the class of potential
jurors the "privilege of participating equally ... in the
administration of justice," 100 U. S., at 308, and it stigmatizes the whole class, even those who do not wish to
participate, by declaring them unfit for jury service and
thereby putting "a brand upon them, affixed by law, an
assertion of their inferiority." Ibid. It is n'w clear
that injunctive relief is available to vindicate these interests of the excluded jurors and the stigmatized class.

Carter v. Jury Commission of Greene County, 396 U. S.
320 (1970); Turner v. Fouche, 396 U. S. 346 (1970);
White v. Crook, 251 F. Supp. 401 (MD Ala. 1966).
Moreover, the Court has also recognizedthat the exclusion of a discernible class from jury service injures not
only those defendants who belong to the excluded class,
but other defendants as well, in that it destroys the
possibility that the jury will reflect a representative
cross section of the community. In Williams v. Florida,
399 U. S. 78 (1970), we sought to delineate some of the
essential features of the jury that is guaranteed, in certain circumstances, by the Sixth Amendment. We concluded that it comprehends, inter alia, "a fair possibility
for obtaining a representative cross-section of the com-

munity."

399 U. S., at 100.'

Thus if the Sixth Amend-

ment were applicable here, and petitioner were challenging a pqst-Duncan petit jury, he would clearly have
standing to challenge the systematic exclusion of any
identifiable group from. jury service. 10
9 The principle of the representative jury was first articulated by
this Court as a requirement of equal protection, in cases vindicating
the right of a Negro defendant to challenge the systematic exclusion
of Negroes 'from his grand and petit juries. E. g., Smith v. Texas,
311 U. S. 128, 130 (1940). Subsequently, in the exercise of its
supervisory power over -federal courts, this Court extended the
principle, to permit any defendant to challenge the arbitrary exclusion from jury service of his own or any other class. E. g., Glasser
v. United States, 315 U. S. 60, 83-87 (1942); Thiel v. Southern
Pacific Co., 328 U. S. 217, 220 (1946); Ballard v. United States, 329
U. S. 187 (1946). Finally it emerged as an aspect of the constitutional right to jury trial in Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 100
(1970).
10 It is of course a separate question whether his challenge would
prevail, i. e., whether the exclusion might be found to have sufficient
justification. See Rawlins v. Georgia, 201 U. S. 638, 640 (1906),
holding that a State may exclude certain occupational categories
from jury service "on the bona fide ground that it [is] for the
good of the community that their regular work should not be inter-

PETERS v. KIFF
493

Opinion of

MARSHALL,

J.

The precise question in this case, then, is whether a
State may subject a defendant to indictment and trial
by grand and petit juries that are plainly illegal in their
composition, and leave the defendant without recourse
on the ground that he had in any event no right to a
grand or petit jury at all. We conclude, for reasons
that follow, that to do so denies the defendant due
process of law.
III
"A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of
due process." In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136
(1955). The due process right to a competent and impartial tribunal is quite separate from the right to any
particular form of proceeding. Due process requires a
competent and impartial tribunal in administrative hearings, Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 271 (1970), and
in trials to a judge, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927).
Similarly, if a State chooses, quite apart from constitutional compulsion, to use a grand or petit jury, due
process imposes limitations on the composition of that
jury.
Long before this Court held that the Constitution
imposes the requirement of jury trial on the States, it
was well established that the Due Process Clause protects a defendant from jurors who are actually incapable
of rendering an impartial verdict, based on the evidence
and the law. Thus a defendant cannot, consistent with
due process, be subjected to trial by an insane juror,
Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U. S. 167, 176 (1912), by
jurors who are intimidated by the threat of mob violence,
Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S.86 (1923), or by jurors who
rupted." We have no occasion here to consider what interests might
justify an exclusion, or what standard should be applied, since the
only question in this case is not the validity of an exclusion but
simply standing to challenge it.

have formed a fixed opinion about the case from newspaper publicity, Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 (1961).
Moreover, even if there is no showing of actual bias
in the tribunal, this Court has held that due process
is denied by circumstances that create the likelihood or
the appearance of bias. This rule, too, was well established long before the right to jury trial was made applicable in state trials, and does not depend on it. Thus
it has been invoked in trials to a judge, e. g., Tumey v.
Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927); In re Murchison, 349 U. S.
133 (1955); Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U. S. 455
(1971); and in pre-Duncan state jury trials, e. g., Turner
v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 466 (1965); Estes v. Texas, 381
U. S. 532, 550 (1965). In Tumey v. Ohio, supra, this
Court held that a judge could not, consistent with due
process, try a case when he had a financial stake in
the outcome, notwithstanding the possibility that he
might resist the temptation to be influenced by that
interest. And in Turner v. Louisiana,supra, the Court
held that a jury could not, consistent with due process, try
a case after it had been placed in the protective custody
of the principal prosecution witnesses, notwithstanding
the possibility that the jurors might not be influenced by
the association. As this Court said in In re Murchison,
supra, "[f] airness of 'course requires an absence of actual
bias in the trial of cases. But our system of law has
always endeavored to prevent even the probability of
unfairness." 349 U. S., at 136.
These principles compel the conclusion that a State
cannot, consistent with due process, subject a defendant
to indictment or trial by a jury that has been selected
in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States.
Illegal and unconstitutional jury selection procedures
cast doubt on the integrity of the whole judicial process.

PETERS v. KIFF
493

Opinion of

MARSHALL,

They create the appearance of bias in the decision of
individual cases, and they increase the risk of actual
bias as well.
If it were possible to say with confidence that the
risk of bias resulting from the arbitrary action involved
here is confined to cases involving Negro defendants, 1
then perhaps the right to challenge the tribunal on
that ground could be similarly confined. The case of
the white defendant might then be thought to present
a species of harmless error.
But the exclusion from jury service of a substantial and identifiable class of citizens has a potential
impactthat is too subtle and too pervasive to admit of
confinement to particular issues or particular cases.
First, if we assume that the exclusion of Negroes affects
the fairness of the jury only with respect to issues presenting a clear opportunity for the operation of race
prejudice, that assumption does not provide a workable guide for decision in particular cases. For the
opportunity to appeal to race prejudice is latent in a
vast range of issues, cutting across the entire fabric of
our society.
Moreover, we are unwilling to make the assumption
that the exclusion of Negroes has relevance only for
issues involving race. When any large and identifiable
segment of the community is excluded from jury service, the effect is to remove from the jury room qualities
of human nature and varieties of human experience,
the range of which is unknown and perhaps unknowable.
It is not necessary to assume that the excluded group
will consistently vote as a class in order to conclude,
as we do, that its exclusion deprives the jury of a
"Or the class may be expanded slightly to include white civil
rights workers, see Allen v. State, 110 Ga. App. 56, 62, 137 S. E. 2d
711, 715 (1964) (alternative holding).

perspective on human events that may have unsuspected
importance in any case that may be presented."
It is in the nature of the practices here challenged
that proof of actual harm, or. lack of harm, is virtually
impossible to adduce. For there is no way to determine
what jury would have been selected under a constitutionally valid selection system, or how that jury would
have decided the case. Consequently, it is necessary
to decide on principle which side shall suffer the consequences of unavoidable uncertainty. See Speiser v.
Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525-526 (1958); In re Winship,
397 U. S. 358, 370-373 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring).
In light of the great potential for harm latent in an
unconstitutional jury-selection system, 13 and the strong
interest of the criminal defendant in avoiding that harm,
any doubt should be resolved in favor of giving the
opportunity for challenging the jury to too many defendants, rather than giving it to too few.
Accordingly, we hold that, whatever his race, a criminal
defendant has standing to challenge the system used to
select his grand or petit jury, on the ground that it
arbitrarily excludes from service the members of any
race, and thereby denies him due process of law. This
certainly is true in this case, where the claim is that
Negroes were systematically excluded from jury service.
In rejecting, for the federal courts, the exclusion of women from
jury service, this Court made the following observations, which are
equally relevant to the exclusion of other discernible groups:
"The truth is that the two sexes are not fungible; a community
made up exclusively of one is different from a community composed
of both; the subtle interplay of influence one on the other is among
the imponderables. To insulate the courtroom from either may not
in a given case make an iota of difference. Yet a flavor, a distinct
quality is lost if either sex is excluded." Ballard v. United States,
329 U. S. 187, 193-194 (1946) (footnote omitted).

Having resolved the question of standing, we turn
briefly to the further disposition of this case. There
is, of course, no question here of justifying the system
under attack. For whatever may be the law with regard to other exclusions from jury service, it is clear
beyond all doubt that the exclusion of Negroes cannot
pass constitutional muster. Accordingly, if petitioner's
allegations are correct, and Negroes were systematically
excluded from his grand and petit juries, then he was
indicted and convicted by tribunals that fail to satisfy
the elementary requirements of due process, and neither
the indictment nor the conviction can stand. Since
he was precluded from proving the facts alleged in support of his claim, the judgment must be reversed and
the case remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
Reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE, with whon MR. JUSTICE BREN-

NAN and MR. JUSTICE POWELL join, concurring in the
judgment.
Since March 1, 1875, the criminal laws of the United
States have contained a proscription to the following
effect:
"No citizen possessing all other qualifications
which are or may be prescribed by law shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any
court of the United States, or of any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude . ..

.

By this unambiguous provision, now contained in 18
U. S. C. ยง 243, Congress put cases involving exclusions

from jury service on grounds of race in a class by themselves. "For us the majestic generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment are thus reduced to a concrete statutory command when cases involve race or color which
is wanting in every other case of alleged discrimination."
Fay v. New York, 332 U. S. 261, 282-283 (1947).
The consequence is that where jury commissioners disqualify citizens on the grounds of race, they fail "to
perform their constitutional duty-recognized by ยง 4
of the Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875 . . .and fully
established since the decision in 1881 of Neal v. Delaware . . . not to pursue a course of conduct in the
administration of their office which would operate to
discriminate in the selection of jurors on racial grounds."
Hill v. Texas, 316 U. S. 400, 404 (1942). Thus, "no
State is at liberty to impose upon one charged with
crime a discrimination in its trial procedure which the
Constitution, and an Act of Congress passed pursuant
to the Constitution, alike forbid . . . . [I]t is our duty
as well as the State's to see to it that throughout the procedure for bringing him to justice he shall enjoy the
protection which the Constitution guarantees. Where,
as in this case, timely objection has laid bare'a discrimination in the selection of grand jurors, the conviction
cannot stand, because the Constitution prohibits the procedure by which it was obtained." Id., at 406.
It is true that the defendant in Hill was a Negro and
petitioner here is a white man. It is also true that there
is no case in this Court setting aside a conviction for
arbitrary exclusions of a class of citizens from jury service where the defendant was not a member of the excluded class. I also recognize that, as in this case, the
courts of appeals reflecting the generally accepted constitutional view, have rejected claims such as petitioner
presents here. For me, however, the rationale and
operative language of Hill v. Texas suggest a broader

sweep; and I would implement the strong statutory
policy of ยง 243, which reflects the central concern of
the Fourteenth Amendment with racial discrimination,
by permitting petitioner to challenge his conviction on
the grounds that Negroes were arbitrarily excluded from
the grand jury that indicted him. This is the better
view, and it is time that we now recognized it in this
case and as the standard governing criminal proceedings
instituted hereafter. Hence, I join the judgment of
the Court.
with whom MR. JUSTICE
BLACKMUN and MR. JUSTICE REHINQUIST join, dissenting.
There is no longer any question, of course, that persons may not be excluded from juries on account of
race. Such exclusions are plainly unlawful and deserving of condemnation. That, however, is not the
issue before us. The real issue is whether such illegality
necessarily voids a criminal conviction, absent any demonstration of prejudice, or basis for presuming prejudice,
to the accused.
Petitioner was indicted for the offense of burglary
on June 6, 1966, and thereafter convicted. The conviction was reversed on direct appeal, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Petitioner was retried on December 8, 1966, was found guilty, and was sentenced to
10 years' imprisonment. Petitioner is not a Negro and
the record in no way suggests that race was relevant in
the proceedings against him. At trial, petitioner made no
challenge to the method of selection of the grand and petit
juries, and he made no challenge to the array of the petit
jury. In his appeal to the Court of Appeals of Georgia,
petitioner still made no claim addressed to the method
of selection of the grand and petit juries. His conviction
was affirmed.

Seven months after his trial, petitioner filed a writ
of habeas corpus in the United States District Court,
asserting for the first time that Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand and petit juries. If
petitioner's allegations are true, then the officials responsible for the jury selection acted in violation of the
Constitution, denying potential Negro jurors the equal
opportunity to participate in the administration of justice. Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 308
(1880). Moreover, if petitioner's allegations are true,
the responsible officials are subject to criminal penalties.
18 U. S. C. ยง 243. However, in order for petitioner's
conviction to be set aside, it is not enough to show
merely that there has been some unconstitutional or unlawful action at the trial level. It must be established
that petitioner's conviction has resulted from the denial
of federally secured rights properly asserted by him.
See Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S. 165, 171-174
(1969); cf. Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 261

(1980).
The opinions in support of the majority position do
not hold that if petitioner's allegations are true, he has
been denied the equal protection of the laws. The
Court has held in a long line of cases that a Negro
defendant is denied equal protection ..by the systematic
exclusion of Negroes from jury service. See, e. g.,
Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 545 (1967); Avery v.
-Georgia, 345 U. S. 559 (1953); Norris v. Alabama, 294
U. S. 587 (1935) ; Carterv. Texas, 177 U. S. 442 (1900) ;
Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880). These
decisions have been predicated from the beginning on
the judicially noticeable fact "that prejudices often exist
against particular classes in the community, which sway
the judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in
some cases to deny to persons of those classes the full
,enjoyment of that protection which others enjoy."

U. S. 370, 386 (1881); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339,
345 (1880). This presumption of prejudice derives from
the fact that the defendant is a member of the excluded
class, but the Court has never intimated that a defendant is the victim of unconstitutional discrimination if
he does not claim that members of his own race have
been excluded. See Alexander v. Louisiana, 405 U. S.
625, 633 (1972).
While the opinion of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL refrains

from relying on the Equal Protection Clause, it concludes
that if petitioner's allegations are true, he has been denied
due process of law. The opinion seeks to equate petitioner's position with that of a defendant who has been
tried before a biased tribunal or one lacking the indicia of
impartiality. It has been held that an accused is denied
due process if the trier of fact is mentally incompetent,
Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U. S. 167 (1912), has a
personal interest in the outcome of" the proceedings,
Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927), has been subjected
to pressures making a dispassionate decision unlikely,

the events underlying a criminal contempt charge. Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U. S. 455 (1971); In re
Murchison, 349 U. S. 133 (1955). This case plainly falls
in none of those categories.
Although the prior cases have not required a showing
that the trier of fact was actually affected by prejudice
in its deliberations, in every case the circumstances were
such as to create a serious "probability of unfairness."

limitation, the Court in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391

U. S. 510 (1968), found no denial of due process where
the determination of guilt had been entrusted to a jury
from which persons opposed to the death penalty had
been excluded. The Court rejected as "tentative and
fragmentary" scientific evidence tending to show "that
jurors not opposed to the death penalty tend to favor
the prosecution in the determination of guilt." 391
U. S., at 517. The Court went on to state,
"We simply cannot conclude, either on the basis
of the record now before us or as a matter of judicial notice, that the exclusion of jurors opposed to
capital punishment results in an unrepresentative
jury on the issue of guilt or substantially increases
the risk of conviction. In light of the presently
available information, we are not prepared to announce a per se constitutional rule requiring the
reversal of every conviction returned by a jury
selected as this one was." 391 U. S., at 517-518.
See also Fay v. New York, 332 U. S. 261, 280-281 (1947).
Here three members of the Court would establish such a
per se rule without the benefit of tentative, fragmentary,
or any other kind of empirical data indicating that allwhite juries tend to be prejudiced against white defendants in nonracial criminal proceedings.
The opinion of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL seeks to magnify this wholly speculative likelihood of prejudice by
noting that the effect of excluding "any large and identifiable segment of the community ... is to remove from the
jury room qualities of human nature and varieties of
human experience, the range of which is unknown and
perhaps unknowable," and "that its exclusion deprives
the jury of a perspective on human events that may have
unsuspected importance in any case that may be presented." Ante, at 503-504. I completely agree that
juries should not be deprived of the insights of the various

segments of the community, for the "common-sense judgment of a jury," referred to in Duncan v. Louisiana,391
U. S. 145, 156 (1968), is surely enriched when all voices
can be heard. But we are not here concerned with the
essential attributes of trial by jury. In fact, since petitioner was tried two years before this Court's decision in
Duncan, there was no constitutional requirement that he
be tried before a jury at all. DeStefano v. Woods, 392
U. S. 631 (1968). Had the State of Georgia proceeded to
try petitioner before a judge, I assume the Court would
not find it a denial of due process if the judge were not the
embodiment of all the "qualities of human nature and
I do not mean to
varieties of human experience."
minimize the importance of these values, but they really
have very little to do with the narrow question whether
petitioner was convicted by a prejudiced tribunal.
Nor do I believe that the illegality of the alleged
exclusion can be viewed as tipping the scales toward
finding a denial of due process. The question of a
jury's bias or prejudice is totally factual in nature. If
the possibility of prejudice is too remote or speculative
to support a finding of unconstitutionality, a different
result cannot be justified by relying on the element of
illegality. The constitutional and statutory prohibition
against such conduct is extraneous to the due process
question, for it in no way renders the possibility of prejudice less remote or less speculative. If this were a
borderline case on the facts, it might conceivably be
appropriate to resolve the doubt against the State due
to its complicity in the alleged unlawful discrimination.
But, judging from all existing authority, this is not a
close case at all.
The opinion of MR. JUSTICE WHITE concurring in the
judgment, as I read it, rests on the statutory prohibition
against racially exclusive juries found in 18 U. S. C. ยง 243.
The opinion draws on dictum in Hill v. Texas, 316 U. S.

400, 404 (1942), a case involving a Negro defendant, as
expressing the "better view" that ยง 243 invalidates the
conviction of any man tried before a jury from which
persons have been excluded on account of race.*
A closer look at the statute is warranted. From all
indications; ยง 243 was intended to serve two purposes:
first, to make explicit what was implicit in the Fourteenth Amendment, that persons cannot be denied the
right to serve on juries because of their race; and second, to prevent racial exclusions from juries by providing criminal penalties for persons violating the statutory command. See Ex parte Virginia, 100 IU. S. 339
(1880); Neal v. Delaware, 103 U. S. 370, 386 (1881).
Insofar as the statute is declarative of rights secured
by the Equal Protection Clause,' it provides no authority for reaching a result that the Constitution itself
does not require. No case has ever held that ยง 243 confers extra-constitutional rights on criminal defendants,
and there is no support for the view that Congress intended to confer such rights when it enacted this legislation in 1875.
The opinion concurring in the judgment suggests that
an expansive reading of ยง 243 is appropriate to "implement the strong statutory policy" against the exclusion

face value, does not mandate reversal in this case. It is expressly
limited to the case where "timely objection has laid bare a discrimination in the selection of grand jurors .

316 U. S., at 406.

As indicated earlier, petitioner first made his allegations seven months
after his trial. Moreover, assuming, arguendo, that there is a statutory right not to be tried before a racially exclusive jury, it is not
clear to me why petitioner's failure to raise the matter in the state
colirts should not preclude him from raising it on a federal habeas
attack. The Court has spoken of a presumption against the waiver
of fundamental, constitutional rights, see, e. g., Johnson v. Zerbat,
304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938), but has never intimated that a similar
presumption should apply with respect to statutory rights.

of persons from jury service on the basis of race. Under
this interpretation, the statute is viewed not so much as
safeguarding the rights of the white defendant, but as
providing a prophylaxis against discriminatory action in
all cases, regardless of any harm that might befall the
accused. While Congress surely had the power to implement the policies of the Fourteenth Amendment in this
manner, it chose instead to deter such violations of the
Fourteenth Amendment by imposing criminal sanctions.
It has been apparent, at least until recently, that such
sanctions have not satisfactorily served to deter. But it
is not for this Court to correct the inadequacies of a
statutory enactment. Moreover, it does nothing to promote adherence to the policies of the Fourteenth Amendment to allow a criminal defendant who has made no
objection at trial and who has no credible claim of personal prejudice to mount a post-conviction attack alleging
that discriminatory jury selection has taken place in the
past.
