EDELMITA, DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC AID OF ILLINOIS v. JORDAN
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 72-1410.

Argued December 12, 1973-Decided March 25, 1974

Respondent brought this class action for injunctive and declaratory
relief against the 1llinois officials administering the federal-state
programs of Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled (AABD), which
are funded equally by the State and Federal Governments, contending that they were violating federal law and denying equal protection of the laws by following state regulations that did not comply
with the federal time limits within which participating States had
to process and make grants with respect to AABD applications.
The District Court by a permanent injunction required compliance
with the federal time limits and also ordered the state officials to
release and remit AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all persons found eligible who had applied therefor between July 1,
1968, the date of the federal regulations, and April 16, 1971, the
date of the court's preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals
affirmed, rejecting the- state officials' contentions that the Eleventh
Amendment, barred the award of the retroactive benefits and that
the judgfient of inconsistency between federal regulations and,
state provisions could be given only prospective effect. Held:
The Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution bars that portion
of the District Court's decree that ordered retroactive pavment
of benefits. Pp. 658-678.
(a) A suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability
payable from public funds in the state treasury is foreclosed by
the Amendment if the State does not consent to suit.. Pp. 662-663.
(b) The Court of Appeals erred in holding that Ex parte Young,
209 U. S. 123, which awarded only prospective relief, did not
preclude the retroactive monetary award here on the ground that
it was an "equitable restitution," since that award, though on
its face directed against the state official individually, as a practical matter could be satisfied only from the general revenues of
the State and was indistinguishable from an award of damages
against the State. Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

MR. JusTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
Respondent John Jordan filed a complaint in the United
-States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
individually and as a representative of a class, seeking
declaratory and injunctive relief against two former
directors of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the
director of the Cook County Department of Public Aid,
and the comptroller of Cook County. Respondent alleged that these state officials were administering the
federal-state programs of Aid to the Aged, Blind, or
Disabled (AABD) in a manner inconsistent with various
federal regulations and with the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Constitution.'
AABD is one of the categorical aid programs administered by the Illinois Department of Public Aid pursuant
to the Illinois Public Aid Code, Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 23, §§ 3-1
through 3-12 (1973). Under the Social Security Act,
the program is funded by the State and the Federal
Governments. 42 U. S. C. §§ 1381-1385.2 The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW),

I In his complaint ifi the District Court, respondent claimed that
the Illinois Department of Publin Aid was not complying with
federal regulations in its processing of public aid applications, and
lso that its refusal to process and allow respondent's claim for a
period of four months, hile processing and allowing the claims
of those similarly situated, violated the Equal Protection Clause of

the Fourteenth Amendment. Respondent asserted that the District
Court could exercise jurisdiction over the cause by virtue of 28
U. S. C §§ 1331 and 1343 (3) and (4). Though not briefed by
the parties before this Court, we think that under our decision in
Hagans v. Lavine,, ante, p. 528, the equal protection claim cannot
be said to be "wholly insubstantial," and that therefore the District
Court was correct in exercising pendent jurisdiction over the statutory claim.
2Effective January 1, 1974, this AABD program was replaced by
a similar program. See 42 U. S. C. §§ 801-805 (1970 ed., Supp. II).

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

415 U. S.

which administers these payments for the Federal Government, issued regulations prescribing maximum permissible time standards within which States participating
in the program had to process AABD applications.
Those regulations, originally issued in 1968, required,
at the time of the institution of this suit, that eligibility determinations must be made by the States within
30 days of receipt of applications for aid to the aged
and blind, and within 45 days of receipt of applications for aid to the disabled. For those persbns found
eligible, the assistance check was required to be received
by them within the applicable time period. 45 CFR
§ 206.10 (a) (3).1
Title 45 CFR § 206.10 (a) (3) (1973) provides in pertinent part:
"(a) State plan requirements. A State plan . . . shall provide
that:
3

"(3) A decision shall be made promptly on applications, pursuant
to reasonable State-established time standards not in excess of:
"(i) 45 days [for aid to aged and blind] ... ; and
"(ii) 60 days . . . [for aid to disabled]. Under this requirement,
the applicant is informed of the agency's time standard in acting on
applications, i ich covers the time from date of application under
the State plan to the date that the assistance check, or notification
of denial of assistance or change of award, or the eligibility decision
with respect to medical assistance, is mailed to the applicant or
recipient. ..."
When originally issued in 1968 the regulations provided that the
applications for aid to the aged and blind be processed within 30
days anc, that aid to the disabled be processed within 45 days of
receipt. They also provided that the person determined to be
eligible must receive his assistance check within the applicable time
period. The amendment to 60 days for aid to the disabled occurred
in 1971, as did the change to require mailing instead of receipt of
the assistance check within the applicable time period; effective
Oct. 15, 1973, the time for processing aged and blind applications
became 45 days.
In addition, at the time of institution of the suit, 45 CFR § 206.10
(a) (6) (1972) provided in pertinent part:

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

During the period in which the federal regulations went
into effect, Illinois public aid officials were administering
the benefits pursuant to their own regulations as provided
in the Categorical Assistance Manual of the Illinois
Department of Public Aid.' Respondent's complaint
charged that the Illinois defendants, operating under
those regulations, were improperly, authorizing grants to
commence only with the month in which an application
was approved and not including prior eligibility months
for which an applicant was entitled to aid under federal
law. The complaint also alleged that the Illinois defendants were not processing the applications within the
applicable time requirements of the federal regulations;
specifically, respondent alleged that his own application
"(6) Entitlement will begin as specified in the State plan, which
(i) for financial assistance must be no later than the date of author"
ization of payment. ....
4 The Illinois regulations, found in the Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual of the Illinois Department of Public Aid, provide in
pertinent part:
"4004.1
"Except for [disability] cases which have a time standard of 45
days, the time standard for disposition of applications is 30 days
from the date of application to the date the applicants are determined eligible and the effective date of their first assistance or are
determined ineligible and receive a notice of denial of ass stance....
"8255. Initial Awards
"Initial awards may be new grants, reinstatements, or cortain types
of resumptions. The]l can be effective for the month in which
Form FO-550 is signed but for no prior period except -under conditions not relevant to this case].
"8255.1 New Grants
"A new grant is the first grant authorized after an application has
been accepted in a case which has not- previously 'received assistance
under the same assistance program. It may be authorized for the
month in which Form FO-550 is signed but not for any prior period
unless it meets [exceptions not relevant to this case]."

for disability benefits was not acted on by the Illlinois
Department of Public Aid for almost four months. Such
actions of the Illinois officials were alleged to violate federal law and deny the equal protection of the laws. Respondent's prayer requested declaratory and injunctive
relief, and specifically requested "a permanent injunction
enjoining the defendants to award to the entire class
of plaintiffs all AABD benefits wrongfully withheld."
In its judgment of March 15, 1972, the District Court
declared § 4004 of the Illinois Manual to be invalid
insofar as it was inconsistent with the federal regulations
found in 45 CFR § 206.10 (a) (3), and granted a permanent injunction requiring compliance with the federal
time limits for processing and paying AABD applicants.
The District Court, in paragraph 5 of its judgment, also
ordered the state officials to "release and remit AABD
benefits wrofigfully withheld to all applicants for AABD
in the State of Illinois who applied between July 1, 1968
"[the date of the federal regulations] and April 16, 197 [1]
[the date of the preliminary injunction issued by the
District Court] and were determined eligible .... ."
5 Paragraph 5 of the District Court's judgment provided:
"That the defendaift EDWARD T. WEAVER, Director, Illinois
Department of Public Aid, his agents, including all of the County
Departments of Public Aid in the State of Illinois, and employees,
and all persons in active concert and participation with them, are
hereby enjoined to release and remit AABD benefits wrongfully withheld to all applicants for AABD in the State of Ililinois who applied
between July 1, 1968 and April 16, 1972 [sic] [should read "1971"],
and were determined eligible, as follows:
"(a) For those aged and blind applicants whose first full AABD
check was not mailed within thirty days from the date of application, AABD assistance for the period beginning with the thirtieth
day from the date of application to the date the applicant's entitlement to AABD became effective;
"(b) (i) For those disabled applicants who applied between July 1,
1968 and December 31, 1970, whose first full AABD check was not

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois officials contended, inter
alia, that the Eleventh Amendment barred the award of
mailed within forty-five days from the date of application, AABD
assistance for the period beginning with the forty-fifth day from the
date of application to the date the applicant's entitlement became
effective'
"(ii) For those disabled applicants who applied between January 1, 1971 and April 16, 1971, whose first full AABD check was
not mailed within sixty days from the date of application, AABD
assistance for the period beginning with the sixtieth day from the
date of application to the date the applicant's entitlement became
effective.
"These AABD benefits shall be mailed to those persons currently
receiving AABD within eight months with an explanato& letter, said
letter having been first approved by plaintiffs' attorney. Any AABD
benefits received pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed
income or resources under Article III of the Illinois Public Aid
Code.
"For those persons not presently receiving AABD:
"(a) A certified letter (return receipt requested), said letter
having been first approved by plaintiffs' attorney, shall be sent to
the last known address of the person, informing him in concise and
easily understandable terms that lieis entitled to a specified amount
of AABD benefits wrongfully withheld, and that he may claim such
amount by contacting the County Department of Public Aid at a
specified address, within 45 days from the receipt of said letter.
"(b) If the County Department of Public Aid does not receive
a claim for the AABD benefits within 45 days from the date of
actual notice to the person, the right to said AABD benefits shall
be forfeited and the file shall be closed. Persons who do not receive
actual notice do not forfeit their rights to AABD benefits wrongfully withheld under this provision."
Paragraph 6 oT the District Court's judgment provided:
"Within 15 days from the date of this decree, defendant
EDWARD T. WEAVER, Director, Illinois Department of Pblic
Aid, shall submit to the court and the plaintiffs' attorney a detailed
statement as to the method for effectuating the relief required by
paragraph 5, supra, of this Decree. Any disputes between the
parties as to whether the procedures and steps outlined by the

between the federal regulations and the provisions of the
Illinois Categorical Assistance Manual could be given
prospective effect only. and that the federal regulations
in question were inconsistent with the Social Security
Act itself. The Court of Appeals rejected these contentions and affirmed the judgment of the District Court.
Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985 (1973)." Because of
an apparent conflict on the Eleventh Amendment issue
with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 (1972),
cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), we granted the petition for certiorari filed by petitioner Joel Edelman, who is
the present Director of the Illinois Department of Public
Aid, and successor to the former directors sued below.
412 U. S. 937 (1973). The petition for certiorari raised
the same contentions urged by the petitioner in the Court
of Appeals.- Because we believe the Court of Appeals
defendant WEAVER will fulfill the requirements of this Decree will
be resolved by the Court."
On July 19, 1973, the author of this opinion stayed until further
order of this Court these two paragraphs of the District Court's
judgment. 414 U. S. 1301.
6Respondent appealed from the District Court's judgment insofar
as it held him not entitled to receive benefits from the date of his
applications (as opposed to -the date of authorization' of benefits as
provided by the federal regulations) and insofar as it failed to
award punitive damages. The Court of Appeals upheld the District
Court's decision against respondent on those points and they are
not at issue here. 472 F. 2d 985, 997-999.
7Citing Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404 U. S' 97 (1971), petitioner
also contends in this Court that the Court of Appeals erred in
refusing to give the District Court's judgment prospective effect
only. Brief for Petitioner 37, incorporating arguments made in
Pet. for Cert. 18-22. The Court of Appeals concluded that
this ground was "not presented to the district judge before the ntry
of judgment, so that it comes too late." 472 F. 2d, at 995. The
Court of Appeals went on, however, to conclude that "[e]ven if the

ground had been timely presented, defendants' contention would be

meritless." Ibid. Noting that one of three tests established by our
decision in Huson for determining the retroactivity of court decisions
was that "the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish
a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent

the Court of Appeals found that the petitioner had not satisfied this test, since the "federal time requirements for processing
applications and paying eligible AABD applicants were made effective July 1, 1968, and defendants were well aware of these mandatory maximum permissible time standards." 472 F. 2d, at 996.
In light of our disposition of this case on the Eleventh Amendment issue we see no reason to address this contention.
S Former Title 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) provided in pertinent
part:
"(a) Contents.
"A State plan for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled, or for aid
to the aged, blind, or disabled and medical assistance for the aged,
must"(8) provide that all individuals wishing to make application
for aid or assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do
so, and that such aid or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals."
HEW, pursuant to authority granted to it by 42 U. S. C. § 1302,
has promulgated regulations, see n. 3, supra, which require that
decisions be made promptly on'applications within 45 days for the
aged and blind and within 60 days for the disabled, and that initiation of payments to the eligible be made within the same periods.
Petitioner renews in this Court the contention made in the Court
of Appeals that these time limitations in the regulations are inconsistent with the statute and therefore an unlawful abuse of the rulemaking authority. Brief for Petitioner 37, incorporating arguments
made in Pet. for Cert. 22-28. Specifically, petitioner argues
V

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

415 U. S.

The historical basis of the Eleventh Amendment has
been oft stated, and it represents one of the more dramatic examples of this Court's effort to derive meaning
from the document given to the Nation by the Framers
nearly 200 years ago. A leading historian of the Court
tells us:
"The right of the Federal Judiciary to summon a
State as defendant and to adjudicate its rights and
liabilities had been the subject of deep apprehension
and of active debate at the time of the adoption of
the Constitution; but the existence of any such right
had been disclaimed by many of the most eminent
advocates of the new Federal Government, and it
wa- largely owing to their successful dissipation of
the fear of the existence of such Federal power that
the Constitution was finally adopted." 1 C. Warren,
The Supreme Court in United States History 91
(rev. ed. 1937).
Despite such disclaimers, 9 the very first suit entered
that the "establishment of arbitrary [forty-five] and sixty day maximums in the HEW regulations for determination of eligibility and
initiation of payments without taking into consideration the efficient
administration of the Act by the State agencies is inconsisteht with
the 'reasonable promptness' requirement and must therefore be
declared unlawful .-. ." Pet. for Cert. 28. The Court of Appeals
rejected this contention, holding that "these time requirements, bind-ing on state welfare officials, are an appropriate interpretation of the
Congressional mandate of 'reasonable promptness."' 472 F. 2d, at
996. We agree with the Court of Appeals.
9 While the debates of the Constitutional Convention themselves do
not disclose a discussion of the question, the prevailing view at the
time of the ratification of th6 Constitution was stated by various
of the Framers in the writings and debates of the period. Examples
of these views have been assembled by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes:
".. Madison, in the Virginia Convention, answering objections
to'the ratification of the Constitution, clearly stated his view as to
the purpose and effect of the provision conferring jurisdiction over

controversies between Stares of the Union and foreign States. That
purpose was suitAbly to provide for adjudication in such cases if
consent should be given but not otherwise. Madison said.: 'The
next case provides for disputes between a foreign state and one of
our states, should such a case ever arise; and between a citizen and
a foreign citizen or subject. I do not conceive that any controversy
can ever be decided, in these courts, between an American state and
a foreign state, without the consent of the pa- ties. If they consent,
provision is here made.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 533.
"Marshall, in the same Convention, expressed a similar view.
Replying to an objection as fo the admissibility of a suit by a
foreign ,state, Marshall-said: 'He objects, in the next place, to its
jurisdiction in controversies btween a state and a foreign state.
Suppose, says he, in such a suit, a foreign state iscast; will she be
bound by the decision? If a foreign state brought a suit- against*
the commonwealth of Virginia, would she not be barred from the
claim if the federal judiciary thought it unjust? The previous consent of the parties is necessary; and, as the federal judiciary will
decide, each party will acquiesce.' 3 Elliot's Debates, 557.
"Hamilton, in The Federalist, No. 81, made the following emphatic
statement of the general principle of "immunity: 'It is inherent in
the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an
individual without its consent. This is the general sense and
the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of
the attributes of soverhignty, is now enjoyed by the government
of every State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender
of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with
the States, -and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The
circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State
sovereignty were discussed in,considering the article of taxation and
need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there
established will satisfy us that there is no color to pretend that the
State governments would by the adoption of that plan be divested
of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free
from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of
good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are
only binding on the cobscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action

401 and Warren, supra, at 91 n. 1. The subsequent year
brought the institution of additional suits against other
States, and caused considerable alarm and consternation
in the country.
The issue was squarely presented to the Court in a
suit brought at the August 1792 Term by two citizens
of South Carolina, executors of a British creditor, against
the State of Georgia. After a year's postponement for
preparation on the part of the State of Georgia, the Court,
after argument, rendered in February 1793, its shortlived decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419. The
decision in that case, that a State was liable to suit by a
citizen of another State or of a foreign country, literally
shocked the Nation. Sentiment for passage of a constitutional amendment to override the decision rapidly
gained momentum, and five years after Chisholm the
Eleventh Amendment was officially announced by President-John Adams. Unchanged since then, the Amendment provides:
"The judicial power of the United States shall not
be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,
commenced or prosecuted against one of the United
States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens
or Subjects of any Foreign State."
While the Amendment by its terms does not bar suits
against a State by its own citizens, this Court has conindependent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it be
to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could
recoveries be enforced? It is evident it could not be done without
waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the
federal courts by mere implication, and in destuction of a preexisting right of the State governments, a power which would involve
such a consequence would be altogether forced and unwarrantable."'
Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 323-325 (1934) (footnotes
omitted).

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

sistently held that an unconsenting State is immune from
suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well
as by citizens of another State. Hans v. Louisiana, 134
U. S. 1 (1890); Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311
(1920); Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 322
U. S. 47 (1944); Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S.
184 (1964); Employees v. Department of Public Health
and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973). It is also well established that even though a State is not named a party to
the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by the
Eleventh Amendment. In Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U. S. 459 (1945), the Court said:
"[W]hen the actibn is in essence one for the recovery
of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke
its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants." Id., at
464.
Thus the rule has evolved that a suit by private parties
seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from
public funds in the state treasury is barred- by the
Eleventh Amendment. Great Northern Life Insurance
Co. v. Read, supra; Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State
Tax Comm'n, 327 U. S. 573 (1946).
The Court of Appeals in this case, while recognizing
that the Hans line of cases permitted the State to raise
the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to suit by its own
citizens, nevertheless concluded that the Amendment did
not bar the award of retroactive payments of the .statutory benefits found to have been wrongfully withheld.
The Court of Appeals held that the above-cited cases,
when read in light of this Court's landmark decision in
Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), do not preclude

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

415 U. S.

the grant of such a monetary award in the nature of
equitable restitution.
Petitioner concedes that Ex parte Young, supra, is
no bar to that part of the District Court's judgment that
prospectively enjoined petitioner's predecessors from
failing to process applications within the time limits
established by the federal regulations. Petitioner argues,
however, that Ex parte Young does not extend so far as
to permit a suit which seeks the award of an accrued
monetary liability which must be. met from the general
revenues of a State, absent consent or waiver by the
State of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, and that
therefore the award of retroactive benefits by the District Court was improper.
Ex parte Young was a watershed case in which this
Court. held- that the Eleventh Amendment did not
bar an action in the federal courts seeking to enjoin
the Attorney General of Minnesota from enforcing a
statut& claimed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment
of the United States Constitution. This holding has
permitted the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution
to serve as a sword, rather than merely as a shield, i'or
those whom they were designed to protect. But the
relief awarded in Ex parte Young was prospective only;
the Attorney General of Minnesota was enjoined to
conform his future conduct of that office to the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. Such relief is
analogous to that awarded by the District Court in the
prospective portion of its order under review in this case.
.But the retroactive portion of the District Court's
order here, which requires the payment of a very substantial amount of money which that court held should
have been paid, but was not, stands on quite a different
footing. These funds will obviously not be paid out of
the pocket of petitioner Edelman. Addressing himself to
a similar situation in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226

(CA2 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), Judge
McGowan

for the court:

"It is not pretended that these payments are to
come from the personal resources of these appellants.

Appellees expressly contemplate that they will,
rather, involve substantial expenditures from the
public funds of the state....
"It is one thing to tell the Commissioner of Social
Services that he must comply with the federal standards for the future if the state is tb have the benefit
of federal funds in the programs he administers.
It is quite another thing, to order the Commissioner
to use state funds to make reparation for the past.
The latter would appear to us to fall afoul of the
Eleventh Amendment if that basic constitutional
provision is to be conceived of as having any present
force." 467 F. 2d. at 236-237 (footnotes omitted).
We agree with Judge McGowan's observations. The
funds to satisfy the award in this case must inevitably
come from the general revenues of the State of Illinois,
and thus the award resembles far more closely the monetary award against the State itself, Ford Motor Co. v.
Department of Treasury, supra, than it does the prospec-

tive injunctive relief awarded in Ex parte Young.
The Court of Appeals, in upholding the award in this
case, held that it was permissible because it was in the
form of "equitable restitution" instead of damages, and
therefore capable of being tailored in such a way as to
minimize disruptions of the state program of categorical
assistance. But we must judge the award actually .made
in this case, and not one which might have been differently tailored in a different case, and we must judge

it iii the context of the importan't constitutional principle
embodied in the Eleventh Amendment."
We do not read Ex parte Young or subsequent holdings
of this Court to indicate that any form of relief may be
awarded against a state officer, no matter how closely
it may in practice resemble a money judgment payable
out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be
labeled "equitable" in nature. The Court's opinion in
Ex parte Voung hewed to no such line. Its citation
of Hagood v. Southern, 117 U. S. 52 (1886), and In re
Ayers, 123 U. S. 443 (1887), which were both actions
11 It may be true, as stated by our Brother DouGLAs in dissent, that
"[m]ost welfare decisions by federal courts have a financial
impact on the States." Post at 680-681. But we cannot agree
that such a financial impact is the same where a federal court
applies Ex parte Young to grant prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, as opposed to an order of retroactive payments as
was made in the instant case. It is not necessarily true that
"[w]hether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for
the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the
nature of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same."
Post, at 682. .This argument neglects the fact that where the State
has a definable allocation to be used in the payment of public aid
benefits, and pursues a certain course of action such as the processing of applications within certain time periods as did Illinois here,
the subsequent ordering by a federal court of retroactive payments
to correct delays in such processing will invariably mean there is
less money available for payments for the continuing obligations of
the public aid system.
As stated by Judge McGowan in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F.
2d 226, 235 (CA2 1972):
"The second federal policy which, might arguably be furthered
by retroactive payments is the fundamental goal of congressional
welfare legislation-the, satisfaction of the ascertained needs of impoverished persons. Federal standards are designed to ensure that
those needs are equitably met; and there may perhaps be cases
in which the prompt payment of funds wrongfully withheld -ill
serve that end. As time goes by, however, retroactive payments
become compensatory rather than remddial; the coincidence between
previously ascertained and existing needs becomes less clear."

against state officers for specific performance of a contract to which the State was a party, demonstrate
that equitable relief may be barred by the Eleventh
Amendment.
As in most areas of the law, the difference between
the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment
and that permitted under Ex parte Young will not in
many instances be that between day and night. The
injunction issued in Ex parte Young was not totally
without effect on the State's revenues, since the state law
which the Attorney General was enjoined from enforcing
provided substantial monetary penalties against railroads
which did not conform to its provisions. Later- cases
from this Court have authorized equitable relief which
has probably had greater impact on state treasuries than
did that awarded in Ex parte Young. In Graham v.
Richardson, 403 U. S. 365 (1971), Arizona and Pennsylvania welfare officials were prohibited from denying
welfare benefits to otherwise qualified recipients who
were aliens. In Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254 (1970),
New York City welfare officials were enjoined from following New York State procedures which authorized the
termination of benefits paid to welfare recipients without
prior hearing.12 But the fiscal consequences to state
2The Court of Appeals considered the Court's decision in
Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 (1964), to be of like import.
But as may be seen from Griffin's citation of Lincoln County v.
Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890), a county does not occupy the same
position as a State for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment. See
also Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973). The fact
that the county policies executed by the county officials in Griffin
were subject to the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment, but
the county was not able to invoke the protection of the Eleventh
Amendment, is no more than a recognition of the long-established
rule that while county action is generally state action for purposes
of the Fourteenth Amendment, a county defendant is not necessarily a siate defenldant for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.

treasuries in these cases were the. necessary result of
compliance with decrees which -by their terms were prospective in nature. State officials; in order to shape
their official conduct to the mandate of the Court's decrees, would more likely have to spend money from the
state treasury than if they had been left free to pursue
their previous course of conduct. Such an ancillary effect
on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in Exparte Young, supra.
But that portion of the District Court's decree which
petitioner challenges on Eleventh Amendment grounds
goes much further than any of the cases cited. It requires payment of state funds, not as a necessary consequence of compliance in the future -with a substantive
federal-question determination, but as a form of compensation to those whose applications were processed on
the slower time schedule at a time when petitioner
was under no court-imposed obligation to conform tc
. a different. standard. While the Court of Appeals described this retroactive award of monetary relief as a
,-form of "equitable restitution," it is in practical effect
indistinguishable in many aspects from an award of
damages against the State. It will to a virtual certainty
be paid from state funds, and not from the pockets of
the individual state officials who were the defendants in
the hction. It is measured in terms of a monetary loss
resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the part
of the defend'at state officials.
Were we to upold this portion of the District Court's
decree, we would be obligated to overrule the Court's
holding in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,
supra. There a taxpayer, who had, under protest, paid
taxes to the State of Indiana, sought a refund of those
taxes from the Indiana state officials who were charged
with their collection. The taxpayer claimed that the tax

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

had been imposed in violation of the United States Constitution. The term "equitable restitution" would seem
even more applicable to the relief sought in that case, since
the taxpayer had at one time had -the money, and paid
it over to the State pursuant to an allegedly unconstitutional tax exaction. 'Yet this Court had no hesitation
in holding that the taxpayer's action was a suit against
the State, and barred by the Eleventh Amendment. We
reach a similar conclusion with respect t o the retroactive
portion of the relief awarded by the District Court in
this case.
The Court of Appeals expressed the view that its
conclusion on the Eleventh Amendment issue was supported by this Court's holding in Department of Employment v. United States, 385 U. S. 355 (1966). There
the United States was held entitled to sue the Colorado
Department of Employment in the United States District Court for refund of unemployment compensation
taxes paid under protest by the American National Red
Cross, an instrumentality of the United States. The
discussion of the State's Eleventh Amendment claim is
confined to the following sentence in the opinion:
"With respect to appellants' contention that the
State of Colorado -has not consented to suit in a
federal forum even where the plaintiff is the United
States, see Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313
(1934), and Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908)."
Id., at 358.
Monaco v. Mississippi,292 U. S. 313 (1934), reaffirmed
the principle that the Eleventh Amendment was no bar to
a suit by the United States against a State. Id., at 329.
In view of Mr. Chief Jfstice Hughes' vigorous reaffirmation in Monaco of the principles of the Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity, we think it unlikely that

States, in citing Ex parte Young as well as Monaco,

intended to foreshadow a departure from the rule to
which we adhere today.
Three fairly recent District Court judgments requiring
state directors of public aid to make the type of retroactive payment involved here have been summarily
affirmed'by this Court notwithstanding Eleventh Amendment contentions made by state officers who were
appealing from the District Court judgment." Shapiro
v. Thompson, 394'U. S. 618 (1969), is the only instance in
which the Eleventh Amendment objection to such retroactive relief was actually presented to this Court in a case
which was orally argued. The three-judge District Court
in that case had ordered the retroactive payment of welfare benefits found by that court to have been unlawfully
withheld because of residence requirements held violative of equal protection. 270 F. Supp. 331, 338 n. 5
(Conn. 1967). This Court, while affirming the judgment,
did not in its opinion refer to or substantively treat the
Eleventh Amendment argument. Nor, of course, did the
summary dispositions of the three District Court cases
contain any substantive discussion of this or any other
issues raised by the parties.
This case, therefore, is the first opportunity the Court
has taken to fully explore and treat the Eleventh Amend' 3 Brief for Respondent 15-18. Decisions of this Court in
which we summarily affirmed a decision of a lower federal court
which ordered the payment of retroactive awards and in which the

ment aspects of such relief in a written opinion. Shapiro
v. Thompson and these three summary affirmances obviously are of precedential value in support of the contention that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the
relief awarded by the District Court in this case. Equally
obviously, they are not of the same precedential value as
would be an opinion of this Court treating the question

on the merits. Since we deal with a constitutional question, we are less constrained by the principle of stare
decisis than we are in other areas of the law. 4 Having
now had an opportunity to more fully consider the
Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument,
we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of
those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with
our holding today.
The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that
even if the Eleventh Amendment be deemed a bar to the
retroactive relief awarded respondent in this case, the
State of Illinois had waived its Eleventh Amendment
immunity and consented to the bringing of such a suit
by participating in the federal AABD program. The
Court of Appeals relied upon our holdings in Parden v.
Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and Petty v.
Tennessee-MissouriBridge Comm'n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959),
14In the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis: "Stare decisis is usually
the wise policy, because in most 'matters it is more important that
the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled
right.... Thiis is commonly true even where the error is a matter
of serious concern, 'Provided correction can be had by legislation.
But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction
through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has
often overruled its earlier decisions. The Court bows to the lessons
of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the
process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is
appropriate also in the judicial function." Burnet v. Coronado Oil
& Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion)

and on the dissenting opinion of Judge Bright in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 452
F. 2d 820, 827 (CA8 1971). While the holding in the
latter case was ultimately affirmed by this Court in 411
U. S. 279 (1973), we do not think that the answer to the
waiver question turns on the distinction between Parden,
supra, and Employees, supra. Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its
terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against -a
general class of defendants which literally included States
or state instrumentalities. Similarly, Petty v. TennesseeMissouri.Bridge Comm'n, supra, involved congressional
approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact
between Tennessee and Missouri, which provided that
each compacting State would have the power "to contract, to sue, and be sued in its own name." The question of waiver or consent under the Eleventh Amendment
was found in those cases to turn on whether Congress had
ikitended to abrogate the immunity in question, and
whether the State by its participation in the program
authorized by Congress had in effect 'consented to the
abrogation of that immunity.
But in this case the threshold fact of congressional
atthorization to sue a class of defendants which literally
includes States is wholly absent. Thus respondent is
n6t only precluded from. relying on this Court's holding
in Employees, but on this Court's holdings in Parden
and Petty as well."
-15 Respondent urges that the traditionally broad power of a
federal court sittifig as a court of equity to fashion appropriate
remedies as are necessary to 'effect congressional purposes requires
that the District Court's award of retroacti.e benefits be upheld.
Respondent places principal reliance, on our prior decisions in
Porter v. Warner'Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395 (1946), and Mitchell v.
DeMario Jewelry, 361 U. S.288 (1960). Both cases dealt with the

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals held that as a matter of federal
law Illinois had "constructively consented" to this suit by
participating in the federal AABD program and agreeing
to administer federal and state funds in compliance with
federal law. Constructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the surrender of constitutional
rights, and we see no place for it here. In deciding
whether a State has waived its constitutional protection
under the Eleventh Amendment, we will find waiver only
where stated "by the most express language or by such
overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave
no room for any other reasonable construction." Murray
v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 171 (1909). We
see no reason to retreat from the Court's statement in
.Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 322 U. S.,
at 54 (footnote omitted):
"[W]hen we are dealing with the sovereign exemption from judicial interference in the vital field of
financial administration a clear declaration of the
state's intention to submit its fiscal problems to
other courts than those of its own creation must be
found."
The mere fact that a State participates in a program
through which the Federal Government provides assistance for the operation by the State of a system of public
aid is not sufficient to establish consent on the part of
the State to be sued in the federal courts. And while
this Court has, in cases such as J. L Case Co. v. Borak, 377
power of a federal court to grant equitable relief for violations of
federal law; the decision in Mitchell indicated that a federal court
could provide equitable relief "complete . . . in light of the statutory

Opinion of the Court

415 U. S.

1. S. 426 (1964), authorized suits by one private party
against another in order to effectuate a statutory purpose, it has never done so in the context of the Eleventh
Abmendment and a state defendant. Since Employees,
.upra, where Congress had expressly authorized suits
against a general class of defendants and the only thing
:left to implication was whether the described class of
defendants included States, was decided adversely to the
putative plaintiffs on the waiver question, surely this
respondent must also fail on that issue. The only language in the Social Security Act which purported to provide a federal sanction against a State which did not
comply with federal requirements for the distribution of
federal monies was found in former 42 U. S. C. § 1384
(now replaced by substantially similar provisions in 42
U. S. C. § 804), which provided for termination of future
allocations of federal funds when a participating State
1
failed to conform with federal law.2
This provision by
its terms did not authorize suit against anyone, and standing alone, fell far short of a waiver by a participating
State of its Eleventh Amendment immunity.
Our Brother MARSHALL argues in dissent, and the
Court of Appeals held, that although the Social Security
Act itself does not create a private cause of action, the
cause of action created by 42 U. S. C. § 1983, coupled
with the enactment of the AABD program, and the issuance by HEW of regulations which require the States
to make corrective payments after successful "fair hear-

that Congress intended a cause of action for public aid

Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S.397 (1970), held that suits

order. Such payments may be retroactive in accordance with applicable Federal policies on corrective payments.
"(3) Payments of assistance within the scope of Federally aided
public assistance programs made in accordance with a court order."
The Court of Appeals felt that § 1983, the enactment of the AABD
program, and the issuance by HEW of the above regulation, indicated
that Congress intended to include within the Social Security Act the
remedy of "effective judicial review" and "the remedy of restoration of benefits withheld in. violation of federal law." 472 F. 2d,
at 994-995 and n. 15. But the adoption of regulations by HEW
to permit the use of federal funds in the satisfaction of judicial
awards is not determinative of the constitutional issues here
presented.

MR. JusTicE MARSHALL, and both the Court of Appeals and the
respondent herein; refer to language in Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S.,
at 420, to the effect that Congress in legislating the Social
Security Act has not "closed the avenue of effective judicial review to
those individuals most directly affected by the administration of its
program." The Court in Rosado was concerned with the compatibility of a provision of New York law which decreased benefits to
some eligible public aid recipients and amendments to the federal act
which required cost-of-living increases. The case did not purport to

fore been suggested that § 1983 was intended to create
a waiver of a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity
merely because an action could be brought under that
decide the Eleventh Amendment issue we resolve today. In finding
the New York law inconsistent with the fedc. al law, Mr. Justice
Harlan, stated:
"New York is, of course, in no way prohibited from using only
state funds according to whatever plan it chooses, providing it
violates no provision of the Constitution.. It follows, however, from
our conclusion that New York's program is incompatible with
§ 402 (a) (23), that petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief and
an appropriate injunction by the District Court against the payment of federal monies according to the new schedules, should the
State not develop, a conforming plan within a reasonable period of
time.
"We have considered and rejected the argument that a -federal
court is without power to review state welfare provisions or prohibit
the use of federal funds by the States in view of the fact that
Congress haz lodged in the Department of HEW the power to cut,
off federal funds fdr noncompliance with statutory requirements.
We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed the avenue
of effective judicial review to those individuals most directly affected
by the administration of its- program. . . . We adhere to King v.
Smith, 392 U. S.309. (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument
that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read
to curtail judicial relief and held Alabama's 'substitute father' regulation to be inconsistent with the federal statute. While King did
not advert specifically to the remedial problem, the unarticulated
premise was that the State had alternative choices of assuming the
additional cost of paying benefits to families with substitute fathers
or not using federal funds to pay welfare benefits according to
a plan that was inconsistent with federal requirements." Id., at
420-421.
Respondent urges that this language is "tantamount to a finding
that Congress conditioned the participation of a state in the categorical assistance program on the forfeiture of immunity from suit
in a federal forum . . . irrespective of the relief sought, [since]
the intent of Congress remains constant." Brief for Respondent

the fact that the Court in Rosado remanded the case to the District

section against state officers, rather than against the
State itself. Though a § 1983 action may be instituted
by public aid recipients such as- respondent, a federal
court's remedial power, consistent with the Eleventh
Amendment, is necessarily limited to prospective injunctive relief, Ex parte Young, supra, and may not include
a retroactive award which requires the payment of funds
from the state treasury, Ford Motor Co. v. Department
of Treasury, supra.

Respondent urges that since the various Illinois officials sued in the District Court failed to raise the
Eleventh Amendment as a defense to the relief sought
by respondent, petitioner is therefore barred" froir
raising the Eleventh Amendment defense in the Court
of Appeals or in this Court. The Court of Appeals
apparently felt the defense was properly presented,
and dealt with it on the merits. We approve of this
resolution, since it has been well settled since the decision
Court to "afford New York an opportunity to revise its program...

or, should New York choose [not to revise its program], issue its
order restraining the further use of federal monies pursuant to the
present statute," 397 U. S., at 421-422, indicates that the Court
felt that retroactive relief was not a permissible remedy. Brief for
Petitioner 17-20. We do not regard Rosado as controlling
either way since the Court was not faced with a district court judgment ordering retroactive -payments or with a challenge based on
the Eleventh Amendment.
"9 Respondent urges that the State of Illinois has abolished its
common-law sovereign immunity in its state courts, and appears
to argue that suit in a federal court against the State may thus
be maintained. Brief for Respondent 23. Petitioner contends that sovereign, immunity has not been abolished in Illinois as
'to this type of case. Brief for Petitioner 31-36. Whether
Illinois permits such a suit to be brought against the State in iti
own courts is not determinative of whether Illinois has relinquished
its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in the federal courts.

that the Eleventh. Amendment defense sufficiently par-takes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar so that it need
not be raised in the trial court:
"[The Attorney General of Indiana] appeared in
the federal District Court and the Circuit Court of
Appeals and defended the suit on the merits. The
objection to petitioner's suit as a violation of the

by Indiana in this Court. This was in time, however. The Eleventh Amendment declares a policy
and sets forth an explicit limitation on federal judicial power of such compelling force that this Court
will consider the issue arising under this Amendment
in this case even though urged for the first time in
this Court." 323 U. S., at 466-467.
For the foregoing reasons we decide that the Court
of Appeals was wrong, in holding that the Eleventh

of the District Court decree which ordered retroactive
payment of benefits found to have been wrongfully
withheld. The judgment of the Court Of Appeals is
therefore reversed- and the cause remanded for further

Congress provided in 42 U. S. C. § 1983 that:
"Every person who, under color of any statute,

stitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured
in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper
proceeding for redress."

In this class action respondent sought to enforce against
state aid officials of Illinois provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. §§ 1381-1385, known as the Aid to
the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program.' The
complaint alleges violations of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and also violations
of the Social Security Act. Hence § 1983 is satisfied in
haec verba, for a deprivation of "rights" which are "secured -by the Constitution and laws" is alleged. *The

Court of Appeals, though ruling that the alleged constitutional violations had not occurred, sustained federal

jurisdiction because federal "rights" were violated. The
main issue tendered us is whether that ruling of the Court
of Appeals is consistent with the Eleventh Amendment.
'Effective January 1, 1974, this AABD program was replaced by
a similar program. See 42 U. S. C. §§ 801-805 (1970 ed., Supp. II).
The program in Illinois is administered by the Department of
Public Aid. Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 23, §§ 3-1 to 3-12 (1973). The
former program was funded in part by the State and in part by the
Federal Government. 42 U. S. C. §§ 303, 304, 306, 1201-1204, 1206,
1351-1355, 1381-1385.

United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or
equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States
by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any
Foreign State."
As the Court, speaking through MR. JusTICE BRmNNAN, said
in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184, 186: "Although

the fact that it ruled adversely to the claimant on the

The Court rejected the defense, saying that state officials

As the complaint in the instant case alleges violations
by officials of Illinois of the Equal Protection Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems that the case is
governed by Ex parte Young so far as injunctive relief
is concerned. The main thrust of the argument is that
the instant case asks for relief which if granted would
affect the treasury of the State.

At the time this suit was brought, 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) provided:
"A State plan for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled, or for aid to
the aged, blind, or disabled and medical assistance for the aged,
must ....

found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and eficient

Nearly identical provisions are now found in 42 U. S. C. § 802 (a)

The Secretary of HEW issued mandatory federal'time standard

adopted a 30-day standard for aged and blind applicants (Ill. Categ.

"parent." Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, held that
under this state-federal cooperative program a State could
not reduce its standard of need in conflict with the federal
standard. It is true that Rosado did not involve retroactive payments as are involved here. But the distinction is not relevant or material because the result in every
welfare case coming here is to increase or reduce the
financial responsibility of the participating State. In no
case when the responsibility of the State is increased to
meet the lawful demand of the beneficiary, is there any
levy on state funds. Whether the decree is prospective
only or requires payments for the weeks or months
wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature
of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same.
We have granted relief in other welfare cases which
included retroactive assistance benefits or payments. In
State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v.
Zarate, 407 U. S. 918, the. sole issue presented to usI
was whether the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare assistance benefits or payments. -That had been ordered by the
lower court and we summarily affirmed, only MR.JusTice
WHITE viting to note probable jurisdiction. We also
summarily affirmed the judgment in Sterrett v. Mothers'

one of the two questions" was whether retroactive payments of benefits violated the Eleventh Amendment. In
Wyman v. Bowens, 397 U. S.49, we affirmed a judgment

state agency to perform certain specified acts which would otherwise
be in the discretion of the agency. '

where payments were awarded in spite of the argument
that the order was an incursion on the Eleventh Amendment.' In Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, we affirmed a judgment which ordered payment of benefits
wrongfully withheld; ' and while we did:not specifically
refer to the point, the lower court had expressly rejected
the Eleventh Amendment argument.'
In Gaither v. Sterrett, 346 F. Supp. 1095, 1099, whose
judgment we affirmed,' 409 U. S. 1070, the court said:
"[T]his court would note that if defendants' position regarding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh

County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529, and Kennecott Copper

the proposition that "actions against a county can be

federally guaranteed rights." 377 U. S., at 233.
Griffin is sought to be distinguished on the ground that
a "county" is not the "state" for purposes of the Eleventh
Amendment. But constitutionally the county in Griffin
was exercising state policy as. are the counties here,
because otherwise the claim of denial of equal protection would be of no avail.
Counties are citizens of their State for purposes of
diversity of citizenship. Bullard v. City of Cisco, 290
U. S. 179; Moor v. County of Alaveda, 411 U. S. 693,

406 U. S.91, 98. But, being citizens of their State, suits
against them by another State are in our original but not
exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1251 (b) (3).
Ibid. Yet, as agencies of the State whether in carrying
out educational policies or otherwise, they are the State,
as Griffin held, for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. And Griffin, like the present case, dealt only
with liability to citizens for state policy and state action.
Yet petitioner asserts that money damages may not
be awarded against state offenses, as such a judgment

will expend itself on the state treasury. But we are
unable to say that Illinois on entering the federalstate welfare program waived its immunity to suit for
injunctions but .did not waive its immunity for compensatory awards which remedy its willful defaults of
obligations undertaken when it joined the cooperative
0
venture."
It is said however, that the Eleventh Amendment is
concerned, not with immunity of States from suit, but
with the jurisdiction of the federal courts to entertain
the suit. The Eleventh Amendment does not speak of
"jurisdiction"; it .withholds the "judicial power" of federal courts "to any suit in law or equity ... against one
of the United States ... ." If that "judicial .ower," or

"jurisdiction" if one prefers that concept, may not be
exercised even in "any suit in ... equity" then Ex parte

Young should be overruled. But there is none eager to
take the step. Where a State has consented to join a
federal-state cooperative projeut, it is realistic to conclude
that the State has agreed to assume its obligations under
that legislation. There is nothing in the Eleventh
Amendment to suggest a difference between suits at law
and suits in equity, for it treats the two without distinction. If common sense has any role to play in constitutional adjudication, once there is a waiver of immunity it
must be true that it is complete so far as effective operation of the state-federal joint welfare program is
concerned.
10 We settled in Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S.397, the queston
whether the grant of authority.under the Social Security Act to
HEW to cut off federal' funds for noncompliance with statutory
requirements provides the exclusive procedure and remedy for viclations of the Act. We said: "We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to thise
individuals most directly affected by the administration of its program," Id., at 420.

We have not always been unanimous in concluding
when a State has waived its immunity. In Pardcn v.
Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184, where Alabama was sued
by some of its citizens for injuries suffered in the interstate operation of an Alabama railroad, the State defended on the grounds of the Eleventh Amendment.
The Court held that Alabama was liable as a carrier
under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, saying:
"Our conclusion is simply that Alabama, when it
began operation of an interstate railroad approximately 20 years after enactment of the FELA, necessarily consented to such suit as was authorized by
that Act," id.,, at 192.
The Court added:
"Our conclusion that this suit may be maintained
is in accord with the common sense of this Nation's
federalism. A State's immunity from suit by an
individual without its consent has been fully recognized by the Eleventh Amendment and by subsequent decisions of this Court. But when a State
leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own and
enters into activities subject to congressional regulation, it subjects itself to that regulation as fully as
if it were a private person or corporation." Id., at
196.
'As the Court of Appeals in the instant case concluded,
Illinois by entering into the joint federal-state welfare
plan just as surely "[left] the sphere that is exclusively its
own." Ibid.
It is argued that participation in the program of federal financial assistance is not sufficient to establish
consent on the part of the State to be sued in federal
courts. But it is not merely participation which supports a finding of Eleventh Amendment waiver, but

participation in light of the existing state of the law as
exhibited in such decisions as Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U. S. 618, which affirmed judgments ordering retroactive
payment of benefits. Today's holding that the Eleventh
Amendment forbids court-ordered retroactive layments.
as the Court recognizes, necessitates an express overruling of several of our recent decisions. But it was against
the background of those decisions that Illinois continued
its participation in the federal program, and it can hardly
be claimed that such participation was in ignorance of
the possibility of court-ordered retroactive payments.
The decision to participate against that background of
precedent can only be viewed as a waiver of immunity
from such judgments.
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
MR. JisTICE BRENNAN,

dissenting.

This suit is brought by Illinois citizens against Illinois
officials. In that circumstance, Illinois may not invoke
the Eleventh Amendment, since that Amendment bars
only federal court suits against States by citizens of
other States. Rather, the question is whether Illinois
may avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient
doctrine of sovereign immunity as a bar to respondent's
claim for retroactive AABD payments. In my view
Illinois may not assert sovereign immunity for the reason
I expressed in dissent in Employees v. Departmont of
Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279, 298 (1.973):
the States surrendered that immunity in Hamilton's
words, "in the plan of the Convention," that formed the
Union, at least insofar as the States granted Congress
specifically enumerated powers. See id., at. 319 n. 7;
Pardenv. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964). Congressional authority to enact the Social Security Act, of

one of the enumerated powers granted Congress by the
States in the Constitution. I remain of the opinion that
"because of its surrender, no immunity exists that can
be the subject of a congressional declaration or a voluntary waiver," 411 .U. S., at 300, and thus have no occasion
to inquire whether or not Congress authorized an action
for AABD retroactive benefits, or whether or not Illinois
voluntarily waived the immunity by its continued participation in the program against the background of
precedents which sustained judgments ordering retroactive
payments.
I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
MR. JusTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JusTIcE
BLACKMUN

joins, dissenting.

The Social Security Act's categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled
(AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from most federal legislation. -Unlike the Fair
Labor Standards Act involved in last Term's decision
in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973), or the Federal Employers'
Liability Act at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377
U. S. 184 (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose
federal standards and liability upon all who engage in
certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling
state agencies. Iiistead, the Act seeks to induce state
participation in the federal welfare programs by offering
federal matching funds in exchange for the State's volun-tary assumption of the Act's requirements. I find this
basic distinction crucial: it leads me to conclude that by
participation in the programs, the States waive whatever
immunity they might otherwise have from federal court

orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.'
In its contacts with the Social Security Act's assistance
programs in recent years, the Court has frequently described the Act as a "scheme of cooperative federalism."
See, e. g., King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 316 (1968);
Jefferson, v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542 (1972). While
this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these programs, for present purposes it serves
to emphasize that the States' decision to participate in
the programs is a voluntary one. In deciding to participate, however, the States necessarily give up their
freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy
as they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their
programs to the requirements of the federal statute and
regulations. As the Court explained in King v. Smith,
supra, at 316-317 (citations omitted):
"States are not required to participate in the program, but those which desire to take advantage
of the substantial federal funds available for distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind
or disabled] are required to submit an AFDC [or
AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of
Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). The plan
must conform with several requirements of the Social
Security Act and with rules and regulations promulgated by HEW."
So here, Illinois elected to participate in the AABD
program, and received and expended substantial federal funds in the years at issue. It thereby obligated
itself to comply with federal law, including the requireIn view of my conclusion on this issue, I find it unnecessary to
consider whether the Court correctly treats this suit as one against
the State, rather than as a suit against a state officer permissible
under the rationale of Ex p.arte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).

ment of former 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) that "such aid
or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals." In Townsend v. Swank,
404 U. S. 282, 286 (1971), we held that participating
States must strictly comply with the requirement that
aid be furnished "to all eligible individuals," and that
the States have no power to impose additional eligibility
requirements which exclude persons eligible for assistance
under federal standards. Today's decision, ante, at 659660, n. 8, properly emphasizes that participating States
must also comply strictly- with the "reasonable promptness" requirement and the more detailed regulations adding content to it.
In agreeing to comply with the requirements of the
Social Security Act and HEW regulations, I believe that
Illinois has also agreed to subject itself to suit in the
federal courts to enforce these obligations. I recognize,
of course, that the Social Security Act does not itself
provide for a cause of action to enforce its obligations.
As the Court points out, the only sanction expressly
-provided in the Act for a participating State's failure to
comply with federal requirements is the cutoff of federal
funding by the Secretary of HEW. Former 42 U. S. C.
§ 1384 (now 42 U. S. C. § 804 (1970 ed., Supp. II)).
But a cause of action is clearly provided by 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983, which in terms authorizes suits to redress deprivations of rights secured by the "laws" of the United 5tates.
And we have already rejected the argument that Congress
intended the funding cutoff to be the sole remedy for
noncompliance with federal requirements. In Rosado v.
Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 420-423 (1970), we held that suits.
in federal court under § 1983 were proper to enforce the
provisions of the Social Security Act against participating
States. Mr. Justice Harlan, writing for the Court, ex-

amined the legislative history and found "not the slightest
indication" that Congress intended to prohibit suits in
federal court to enforce compliance with federal standards.
Id., at 422.
I believe that Congress also intended the full panoply
of traditional judicial remedies to be available to the
federal courts in these §.1983 suits. There is surely no
indication of any congressional intent to restrict the
courts' equitable jurisdiction. Yet the Court has held
that "[u]nless a statute in so many words, or by a
necessary and inescapable inference, restricts the court's
jurisdiction in equity, the full scope of that jurisdiction
is to be recognized and applied." Porter v. Warner
Holding Co., 328 U. S. 395, 398 (1946). "When Congress entrusts to an equity court the enforcement of
prohibitions contained in a regulatory enactment, it must
be taken to have acted cognizant of, the historic power
of equity to provide complete relief in light of the statutory purposes." Mitchell v. DeMario Jewelry, 361 U. S.
288, 291-292 (1960).
In particular, I am firmly convinced that Congress
intended the restitution of wrongfully withheld assistance payments to be a remedy available to the federal
courts in these suits. Benefits under the categorical
assistance programs "are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them." Goldberg
v. Kelly, 397 U. S. 254, 262 (1970). Retroactive pay,
ment of benefits secures for recipients this entitlement
which was withheld in violation of federal law. Equally
important, the courts' power to order retroactive payments is an essential remedy to insure future state compliance with federal requirements. See Porterv. Warner
Holding Co., supra, at 400. No other remedy can effectively deter States from the strong temptation to cut

welfare budgets by circumventing the stringent requirements of federal law. The funding cutoff is a
drastic sanction, one which HEW has proved unwilling
or unable to employ to compel strict compliance with
the Act and regulations. See Rosado v. Wyman, supra,
at 426 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring). Moreover, the cutoff
operates only prospectively; it in no way- deters the
States from even a flagrant violation of the Act's requirements for as long as HEW does not discover the violation and threaten to take such action.
Absent any remedy which may act with retroactive
effect, state welfare officials have everything to gain and
nothing to lose by failing to comply with the congressional mandate that assistance be paid with reasonable
promptness to all eligible individuals. This is not idle
speculation without basis in practical experience., In
this very case, for example, Illinois officials have knowingly violated since 1968 federal regulations on the
strength of an argument as to its invalidity which even
the majority deems unworthy of discussion. Ante, at
659-660, n. 8. Without a retroactive-payment remedy, we
-are indeed faced with "the spectre of a state, perhaps
calculatingly. defyii~g federal law and thereby depriving
welfare recipients of the financial assistance Congress
thought it was giving them." Jordanv. Weaver, 472 F.
2d 985, 995 (CA7 1972). Like the Court of Appeals, I
cannot believe that Congress could possibly have intended
any such result.
Such indicia of congressional intent as can be gleaned
from the *statute confirm that Congress intended to
authorize retroactive payment of assistance benefits
.unlawfully withheld. Availability of such payments is
implicit in the "fair hearing" requirement, former 42
U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (4), which permitted welfare recipients
to challenge the denial of assistance. The regulations

EDELMAN v. JORDAN
651

MARSHALL, ,J.,

dissenting

which require States to make corrective payments retroactively in the event of a successful fair hearing challenge, 45 CFR § 205.10 (a) (18), merely confirm the
obvious statutory intent. HEW regulations also authorize federal matching funds for retroactive assistance payments made pursuant to court order, 45 CFR
§§ 205.10 (b)(2), (b)(3). We should not lightly disregard this explicit recognition by the agency charged
with administration of the statute that such a remedy
was authorized by Congress. See Griggs v. Duke Power
Co., 401 U. S.424, 433-434 (1971).
Illinois chose to participate in the AABD program
with its eyes wide open. Drawn by the lure of federal

funds, it voluntarily obligated itself to comply with the
Social Security Act and HEW regulations, with full
knowledge that Congress had authorized assistance recipients to go into federal court to enforce these obligations
and to recover benefits wrongfully denied. Any doubts
on this score must surely have been removed by- our
decisions in Rosado v. Wyman, supra, and Shapiro v.
Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), where we affirmed a
district court retroactive payment order. I cannot avoid
the conclusion that, by virtue of its knowing and voluntary decision to nevertheless participate in the program,
the State necessarily consented to subject itself to these
suits. I have no quarrel with the Court's view that
waiver of constitutional rights should not lightly be
inferred. But I simply cannot believe that the State
could have entered into this essentially contractual agreement with the Federal Government w'thout recognizing
that it was subjecting itself to the full scope of the § 1983
remedy provided by Congress to enforce the terms of
the agreement.
Of course, § 1983 suits are nominally brought against
state officers, rather than the State itself, and do not

ordinarily raise Eleventh Amendment problems in view
of this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123
(1908). But to the extent that the relief authorized
by Congress in an action under § 1983 may be open to
Eleventh Amendment objections,' these objections are
waived when the State agrees to comply with federal
requirements enforceable in such an action. I do not
find persuasive the Court's reliance in this case on the
fact that "congressional authorization to sue a class of
defendants which literally includes States" is absent.
Ante, at 672. While true, this fact is irrelevant here, for
this is simply not a case "literally" against the State.
While the Court successfully knocks down the strawman
it has thus set up, it never comes to grips with the undeniable fact that Congress has "literally" authorized this
suit within the terms of § 1983. Since there is every
reason to believe that Congress intended the full panoply
of judicial remedies to be available in § 1983 equitable
actions to enforce the Social Security Act, I think the
conclusion is inescapable that Congress authorized and
the State consented to § 1983 actions in which the relief
might otherwise be questioned on Eleventh Amendment
grounds.
My conclusion that the State has waived its Eleventh
Amendment objections to court-ordered retroactive assistance payments is fully consistent with last Term's
2

It should be noted that there has been no determination in this case
that state action is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.
Thus, the Court necessarily does not decide whether the States'
Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity may have been limited by
the later enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that
such a limitatiob is necessary to- effectuate the purposes of that
Amendment, an argument advanced by an -amicus in this case. In
view of my conclusion that any sovereign immunity which may
exist has been waived, I also need not reach this issue.

decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health
and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973). As I emphasized in
my concurring opinion, there was no voluntary action by
the. State in Employees which could reasonably be construed as evidencing its consent to suit in a federal
forum.
"[T]he State was fully engaged in the operation of
the affected hospitals and schools at the time of the
1966 amendments. To suggest that the State had
the choice of either ceasing operation of these vital
public services or 'consenting' to federal suit suffices,
I believe, to demonstrate that the State had no
true choice at all and thereby that the State did not
voluntarily consent to the exercise of federal jurisdiction .

. . ."

Id., at 296.

A finding of waiver liere is also consistent with the
reasoning of the majority in Employees, which relied on
a distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary"
functions of state government. Id., at 284-285. This
distinction apparently recognizes that if sovereign immunity is to be at all meaningful, the Court must be reluctant to hold a State to have waived its immunity simply
by acting in its sovereign capacity-i. e., by merely performing its "governmental" functions. On the other
hand, in launching a profitmaking enterprise, "a State
leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own," Parden v.
Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S., at 196, and a voluntary
waiver of sovereign immunity can more easily be
found. While conducting an assistance program for the
needy is surely a "governmental" function, the Statd here
has done far more than operate its own program in its
sovereign capacity. It has voluntarily subordinated its
sovereignty in this matter to that of the Federal Government, and agreed to comply with the conditions imposed

by Congress upon the expenditure of federal funds. In
entering this federal-state cooperative program, the State
again "leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own," and
similarly may more readily be found to have voluntarily
waived its immunity.
Indeed, this is the lesson to be drawn from this Court's
decision in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n,
359 U. S. 275 (1959), where the Court found that the
States had waived the sovereign immunity of the Commission by joining in an interstate compact subject to
the approval of Congress. The Court in Petty emphasized that it was "called on to interpret not-unilateral
state action but the terms of a consensual agreement"
between the States and Congress, id., at 279, and held
that the States who join such a consensual agreement,
"by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached."
Id., at 281-282. Although the congressional intent regarding the sue-and-be-sued clause was by no means
certain, the Court held that the surrounding conditions
made it clear that the States accepting it waived their
sovereign immunity, id., at 280, especially since this
interpretation was necessary to keep the compact "a
living interstate agreement which performs high functions in our federalism." Id., at 279.
I find the approach in Petty controlling here. As even
the dissent in that case recognized, id., at 285 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), Congress undoubtedly has the
power to insist upon a waiver of sovereign immunity as
a condition of its consent to such a federal-state agreement. Since I am satisfied that Congress has in. fact
done so here, at least to the extent that the federal courts
