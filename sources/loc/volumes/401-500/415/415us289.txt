MISSISSIPPI v. ARKANSAS
ON EXCEPTIONS TO SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT

No. 48, Orig. Argued December 5, 1973-Decided February 26, 1974
In this boundary dispute between Arkansas and Mississippi over
an area known as Luna Bar in the abandoned bed of the Mississippi River between the upstream and downstream ends of Tarpley Cut-off, where Arkansas' Chicot County and Mississippi's
Washington County adjoin, the report of the Special Master is
adopted, in which he .found that Luna Bar was formed by
accretion resulting from the gradual westward movement of the'
Mississippi River, and is therefore part of the State of Mississippi,
and not by avulsive process as claimed by Arkansas. Pp. 291-294.

nal action against Arkansas in November 1970. The
b:l of complaint, which accompanied the motion for
leave to file, prayed that the boundary line between the
two States, in the old bed of the Mississippi River from
the upstream end tc the downstream end of Tarpley
Cut-off, that is, the Spanish Moss Bend-Luna BarCarter Point area where Arkansas' Chicot County and
Mississippi's Washington County adjoin, be fixed and
determined.
The river was originally established as the boundary
between the States by their respective Acts of Admission.
Mississippi's Act, 3 Stat. 348 (1817), described the line
s "up" the river.2 Arkansas' Act, 5 Stat. 50 (1836),
described the line as "up the middle of the main channel of the said river." See, also, Arkansas' Constitution,
Art. 1 (1874). Over 50 years ago the question whether
there was any difference in the meaning of these two
descriptions was resolved and the boundary was determined to be "the middle of the main navigable channel,
and not along the line equidistant between the banks."
Arkansas v. Mississippi, 250 U. S. 39, 43 (1919). That
decision was in conformity with the rule of the thalweg
enunciated in Iowa v. Illinois, 147 U. S. 1, 7-8, 13 (1893),
and followed, in the absence of special circumstances,
in many subsequent cases. See, for example, Minnesota v. Wisconsin, 252 U. S. 273, 281-282 (1920); New
Jersey v. Delaware, 291 U. S. 361, 379-380 (1934);
Arkansas v. Tennessee, 310 U. S. 563, 571 (1940).
Arkansas responded to Mississippi's motion and moved
that leave to file be denied and that the c&mplaint be
dismissed. The motion for leave to file, however, was
granted. 400 U. S. 1019 (1971). Thereafter, the Hon2 Mississippis Constitution of 1890, Art. 2, however, reads, "up
the middle of the Mississippi river, or thread of the stream."

orable Clifford O'Sullivan was appointed Special Master.
402 U. S. 926 (1971). The Master's report eventually
issued and was ordered filed. 411 U. S. 913 (1973).1
Arkansas' exceptions to the report and Mississippi's response to those exceptions were forthcoming in due
course and the case has been argued to this Court.
Prior to 1935 Spanish Moss Bend was on the thalweg,
or primary channel, of the Mississippi River. It has not
been the thalweg,_ however, since the Tarpley Cut-off
was established about five miles to the east in 1935 by
the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The present
controversy focuses on what is known as Luna Bar on the
eastern bank of the old river at Spanish Moss Bend. The
issue simply is whether Luna Bar came into being by
gradual migration of the river westward, or, instead, by
some avulsive process, also to the westward. Depending
on the resolution of this factual issue, legal consequences
ensue in line with established principles conceded by the
two States to be the law relating to riparian accretion
and avulsion. Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359 (1892);
Missouri v. Nebraska,196 U. S. 23 (1904); Bonelli Cattle
Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313, 825-327 (1973).
These
principles need no reiteration here. It suffices to'say
that if Luna Bar was formed by accretion, this litigation is to be resolved in favor of Mississippi, and, contrarily, if Luna Bar resulted from an avulsion, the suit
is to be resolved in favor of Arkansas.
Upon our independent review of the record, we find
ourselves in complete agreement and accord with the
findings of fact made by the Special Master.4 Report

34. We therefore affirm those findings, overrule Arkansas' exceptions to the Master's report, confirm that report,
and in general accept the Master's recommendations for
a decree.
We deem it unlecessary to outline at length the evidence adduced, or jo reproduce here the detailed analysis
of that evidence made by the Special Master. We note
only-- that the dissent would regard the case as close
bec ause of three factors: (1) certain testimony as to
ancient trees on Luna Bar indicated by the presence of
three stumps that could not have lived and died there in
tha last 100 years, (2) some testimony as to soil on the
bar "not compatible with the soil that would result
from accretion," post, at 298, and (3) the bar's "hard
core ... elevation," post; at 299-300, that coincides with
the elevation "on the adjacent Arkansas bank." These
factors, in our view, would be pertinent except that they
reflect only the approach and testimony of Arkansas'
witnesses and overlook pertinent and persuasive testimony to the opposite effect from expert witnesses for Mississippi. The latter are the witnesses that the Special
Master credited, as do we, in the evaluation of the conflicting testimony.
Arkansas conceded that Mississippi made out a prima
facie case of accretion. Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. In addition, the Master was impressed with the total absence of
private litigation Luna Bar has been determined to be in Mississippi.

Another private suit involving the issue is the one mentioned above
as pending in the Arkansas state courts. Arkansas Land & Cattle
Co. v. Anderson-Tully Co., supra. Further proceedings in that litigation were stayed on February 16, 1971, by the Chancery Court
of Chicot County, Arkansas, until final judgment in the present
action. Special counsel for the respective States here were counsel
for the private parties in the cited federal and state court cases.

any known historical reference to an avulsion in this area
that changed the course of the river by the necessary
half mile. And the dissent acknowledges, post, at 295, as
to how "Mississippi made its case," and concedes that the
testimony "gives force to the argument that accretion
formed Luna Bar," that there was testimony that in the
Mississippi River "avulsion would shorten the course of
the river, while here the course was lengthened," and
that Mississippi's experts knew of no instance "where
avulsion had worked the way Arkansas claims."
So far as the ancient tree stumps are concerned, Mississippi presented evidence from forestry experts that
the forest on Luna Bar was one predominantly of pioneer
species with the expected small accompanying, scattered
areas of secondary and climax trees, and with no tree
more than 37 years old. This is consistent with the first
appearance of growth upon Luna Bar depicted in early
Mississippi River Commission charts showing' the bar to
be barren and without vegetation. Report 10. Mississippi's position. as to the three particular stumps was that
they had been washed in by floodwaters in preceding
years; that one had moss on its roots, a condition incompatible with growth in place; and that, at the point where
another allegedly was found in 1972, the elevation of the
bar was at least 10 feet above what it had been 90 years
earlier. Thus the stump necessarily should have been
deep in the undersoil of the bar and not on its surface at
the time of its removal. Report 11.
The soil composition is purely a matter of condicting
testimony and we are persuaded by Mississippi's evidence. Deep borings, of course, would be below the
riverbed, and would be expected to be consistent
throughout the area on both sides of the river. And, as
noted above, charts of 1882 and 1894, admitted into

evidence, show Luna Bar as a dry sandbar with no
vegetation.
The claim of similar elevations, too, encounters strong
and convincing opposing authority. Dr. Charles R.
Kolb, a highly qualified expert for Mississippi, testified
that his study disclosed that the Arkansas bank, from
the first comparative recordings until fairly recent times,
was about 12 feet higher than Luna Bar. Report 15,
19. R.. 354-357. And there is an absence of levee
formations on Luna Bar, as contrasted with the presence
of pre-1860 levees on the Arkansas bank.
We agree with the Special Master's evaluation of the
evidence and conclude, as he did, that Arkansas did not
sus'tain its burden of rebutting Mississippi's conceded
prima facie case, a burden the Arkansas court has described as "considerable." Pannellv. Earls, 252 Ark. 385,
388, 483 S. W. 2d 440, 442 (1972).
Upon our own consideration and our independent review of the entire record, of the report filed by the
Special Master, of the exceptions filed thereto, and of
the argument thereon, a decree is accordingly entered.
It is so ordered.

post, p. 302.]
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.

Luna Bar is today an island in the Mississippi River.
Arkansas on the west claims it is hers because the river
as a result of an avulsion moved west. Mississippi
claims it is hers because Luna Bar was created as a result
of slow gradual accretion. The Special Master found
for Mississippi and the case is here on exceptions to his
Report.

MISSISSIPPI v. ARKANSAS
289

DOUGLAs,

J., dissenting

No one has a historical recorded account of what happened. Mississippi made its case by use of experts w¢ho
testified as to how the Mississippi River usually performs.
They testified that the river at low water washes the
concave side of a turn (this being the side that marks
Luna Bar) but that during high water it scours the convex side (that being Arkansas). That testimony gives
force to the argument that accretion formed Luna Bar,
washing heavily Arkansas land to form the island.
Favoring Mississippi was other testimony that at leas;t in
the Mississippi River avulsion would shorten the course of
the river, while here the course was lengthened. Never
did the experts know of an instance where avulsion had
worked the way Arkansas claims.
Opposed to these highly qualified experts were lay
witnesses who knew Luna Bar. They had located great
trees that once grew there, the age of the trees going back
before 1800. Luna Bar therefore was not recently
created nor was it created within the last 100
years. It had been there a long, long time. Moreover,
the soil matched Arkansas' soil and the height of the
land on Luna Bar was comparable to Arkansas' elevation. The Arkansas case was further bolstered by the
theory that in the 1870's the avulsive action took place
when the river returned to its old channel.
The Special Master stated in his report:
"I am aware that as Special Master it is not my
function to render a decision. My duty is to make
a report containing such review of the evidence as
I consider justifies my findings of fact. I do not
consider that to make the findings I do, it is aecessary to totally destroy the validity of Arkansas'
contentions. The burden of persuasion was upon
Arkansas. Initially Arkansas conceded that Missis-

Mississippi." Report of Special Master 33.
The case is close and if we were governed by the rule
governing district court findings when an appeal is
taken I would agree that the Special Master's findings
are not "clearly erroneous." Heretofore the Court has
not c6nsidered itself limited in its review of its Masters

by the "clearly erroneous" test.1
1

We said in United

Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52 (a) provides that findings of fact made
by district courts "shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous."
It also provides that "[tjhe findings, of a master, to the extent
that the court adopts them, shall be considered as the findings
of the court." Rule 53 (e) (2) provides that "[i]n an action to
be tried without a jury the court shall accept the master's findings of fact unless clearly erroneous." But those Rules are applicable only to "the procedure in the United States district courts in
all suits of a civil nature." Rule 1.
But we have never formulated such a rule when it comes to our
review of reports submitted b y Special Masters whom we have
named in cases under our original jurisdiction. It seems inappropriate that we adopt such a rule in view of the delicacy and gravity
of many of the issues in these contests between two sovereign States
or between the United States and one or more of the States. The
ultimate decision on the facts should rest with us, the sole tribunal
to which the resolution of the issues in this type of case has been
entrusted by Art. III.
In Georgia v. Brailsford, 3 Dall. 1, the Court in a case under the
head of its original jurisdiction impaneled a jury. And that procedure, though soon abandoned, was followed in a few other cases:

MISSISSIPPI v. ARKANSAS

DouGLAS, J., dissenting

States v. Utah, 283 U. S' 64, 89, that the "findings of the
Master... are justified by the evidence"; and in Kanses
v. Missouri,322U. S. 213,232, that the Master's judgment
"accords with the conclusions we make from our own'
independent examination of the record." And see
United States v. Oregon, 295 U. S. 1, 29. It has at times
been argued that original jurisdiction should not be taken,
because of the waste of judicial time by this Court: "In
an original suit, even when the case is flrst referred to
a master, this Court has the duty of making an independent examination of the evidence, a time-consuming
process which seriously interferes with the discharge of
our ever-increasing appellate duties." Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U. S. 439, 470 (Stone, C. J., dissenting). The majority opinion did not dispute that claim
but gave special reasons why original jurisdiction was
necessary in that case. Id., at 465-466. The findings
of the Special Master are of course entitled to respect
and their weight will be increased to the extent that
credibility of witnesses is involved, as he. saw them and
heard them, while we have only a cold record. Credibility, however, seems to play no part here. The record

consists of maps and of testimony of witnesses. Those
testifying for Mississippi qualified as eminent experts.
Those testifying for Arkansas were in part experts and
in part countrymen who for years knew Luna Bar, frequented it, and studied it. The experts of Mississippi
state a plausible explanation that bolsters the theory of
accretion. But the countrymen with their physical evidence convince me that the Mississippi River acted in an
unprecedented way, found an old channel and in one
convulsive operation invaded Arkansas, leaving Luna Bar
an island carved out of Arkansas.2
There is evidence taken from borings that the soil of the
island is not compatible with the soil that would result
from accretion. An expert, Dr. Clarence 0. Durham,
head of the Geoscience Department of Louisiana State
University spent two days on the island. He concluded
that prior to 1823, the date of the first Federal Land Office
Survey, the river had flowed west of the island but that
between 1823 and 1871 the channel at that point was not
divided. He reached this conclusion from an 1872. map
2The Master found that Arkansas' proof failed to justify a finding
that there Was an abandoned channel which the Mississippi found
again in the 1870's. The absence of independent evidence of such
a channel is not surprising, in view of the quality of the maps made
before the 1870's. For example, the Master attaches as appendices
to his report six maps of the area charted before the 1870's. All
of them trace the outline of the Mississippi for navigational purposes.
But none are topographical maps which would show the existence
of an ancient, dry, low-lying channel on the Arkansas mainland into
which the Mississippi could divert. This, however, does not show
that such a channel did not exist or refute the physical evidence
which Arkansas has mustered. Just as Arkansas has not produced
a pre-1870 map proving the prior existence of the ancient channel,
Mississippi directs us to no map to prove that such a channel did
not exit.

which showed an abrupt shift of the Arkansas webtern

bank into an abandoned prehistoric channel of the river.
The island is the hard base of an ancient clay plug that
dates prior to 1823. The ancient cypress stumps on the
Arkansas mainland and those on the west side of the
island are compelling evidence that the island and the
mainland were connected for some centuries. To say

that the island was formed by accretion is to use magic
to make the ancient cypress stumps on the island disappear.

Those trees are of the climax species; and the
experts all agree that where climax trees appear the land
mass on which they grow is at least 150 years old. The
trees found on the high ground of the island were black
walnut and red mulberry. Those trees were there prior
to 1800 which would be impossible if Luna Bar was the
product of accretion in modern times. 3 The hard core
3 The Master stated that the testimony about vegetation and the
age of trees on the island was, "as far as I can tell, reasonably
comparable" to that presented in two earlier cases concerning the
origin of Luna Bar (Anderson-Tully Co. v. Walls, 266 F. Supp. 804;
Arkansas Land & Cattle Co. v. Anderson-Tully Co., 248 Ark. 495,
452 S. W. 2d 632). The Master also stated: "It was the position
of Mississippi that various stumps found on Luna Bar and Spanish
Moss Bend had been brought there by flood waters. Its position
in such regard was suitained by the courts heretofore considering the
matter. I do. likewise."
Neither of the earlier cases makes clear the exact extent of testimony admitted, or precisely how it corresponds with the testimony
given before the Special Master in the instant case. Arkansas, however, notes that "evidence of the relic trees found on top of tho
island [was] not discovered at [the time of the earlier-litigation],
and this record is the only record of their e-istenc.e." Mormo'er, it
is hardly true that the Arkansas court "sustained" Mississippi's position that the cypress stimnps found in Spani,4h Moss Bend had been
carried there by floodwaters. That court, remanding the case to
the lower court for further proceedings, noted that the appearance

of the island has an elevation between 133.2 feet and
133.5 feet; and th elevation on the adjacent Arkansas
bank is between 132.2 feet and 139 feet.' Again there
of at least two of the stumps in photographs tended to lend support
to testimony that they had grown in place. So did the designation
of "cypress knees" and "cypress stumps" and trees along the Arkansas shore near the mainland on several early Mississippi River Commission charts. These designations indicated that there was evidence
of cypress stumps many years before 1940, when it was contended
that they had been floated downriver and left at Luna Bar. 248
Ark., at 502, 452 S. W. 2d, at 637. Finally, the opinion of the
District Court in Anderson-Tully Co. v. Walls, supra, does not even
mention the cypress stumps. Therefore, as to the ancient relic
stumps found on top of the island and in Spanish Moss Bend,it
would not seem that we are forced to overcome the decision of any
previous court which has accepted Mississippi's theory about their

origin.
On the other hand, Richard Proctor, who has lived in the area
of Luna Bar for 91 years, testified that he had fished around cypress
stumps in the river which had been there "as long as I been big
enough to- know." Moreover, he testified that he found a mink
in an old cistern on the Bar, the existence: of which is quite inconsistent with the Point Bar -migration theory.
4
The fact that an early Mississippi River Commission hydrographic survey showed the elevation of Luna Bar to be somewhat
lower than that of the land on the west bank of Spanish Moss Bend,
the Arkansas side of the river, does not disprove Arkansas' position
that Luna Bar 5riginated as a portion of the Arkansas mainland
which was severed by avulsion. Reference to Appendix A of the
Court's decree, a topographic map prepared by the Army Corps of
Engineers, shows the rolling nature of much of the land adjacent
to the Mississippi River in the area of Luna Bar and indicates that
a difference in elevation between two points would not be startling.
Moreover, it appears that in 1874, between the time when Arkansas
claims the avulsion occurred and the time the Mississippi River
Commission conducted its survey, there was a flood in the Mississippi
which would iave washed at Luna Bar. See Arkansas Land & Cattle
Co. v. Anderson-Tully Co., supra, at 506, 452 S. W. 2d, at 639.

is a compelling inference that while accretion may have
added some soil to the island, the high hard core of the
island was once connected with the mainland and severed
from it by some abrupt and violent action of the river.
