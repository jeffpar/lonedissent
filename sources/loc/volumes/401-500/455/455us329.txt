JUSTICE

O'CONNOR took no part in the consideration or de-

JUSTICE WHITE,

dissenting.

We granted certiorari in this case to decide one very narrow question: "May a court, without articulating its rationale,
summarily deny an application for attorneys' fees under 42
U. S. C. § 1988?" Petitioner concedes that "not ... all cases
require opinions," Brief for Petitioner 6, n. 6, but argues that
with respect to an application for fees under § 1988 "[t]he
combination of discretion and a standard for the exercise of
that discretion necessitates a statement of reasons to determine whether the decision is proper." Id, at 12. In my
view, such an application is not sufficiently distinguishable

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
WHITE,

J., dissenting

455 U. S.

from numerous other motions and applications that a court
may concedely decide without opinion. Whether this is a
good or bad method of exercising discretion in a particular
case, or even in general, is not at issue in this case. Because
I do not believe that there is any per se rule that a court may
never summarily deny an application for fees, I would affirm
the decision below.
Accordingly, I dissent from the majority's disposition of
this case.
