v. PINE CREEK CONSERVANCY
DISTRICT E A.

ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO

No. 76-667.

Decided February 22, 1977

Where the District Court rejected all of appellants' challenges to the
constitutionality of an Ohio statute establishing procedures for the
organization and governance of conservancy districts (political subdivisions of the State invested with the power to carry out flood prevention and control measures), on the sole ground that such challenges
were foreclosed by Orr v. Allen, 248 U. S. 35, but none of the issues
presented was raised or passed upon in Orr, the District Court's judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a full consideration of

such issues.
Reversed and remanded.
PER CURL4M.

Chapter 6101 of the Ohio Revised Code establishes proce-

dures for the organization and governance of conservancy
districts, political subdivisions of the State invested with
the power to carry out flood prevention and control measures.
The statute provides for the creation of a conservancy court
each time that a petition is duly filed to propose the creation
of a new district. It is the conservancy court's responsibility first to evaluate the desirability of establishing the proposed district and then, if it decides to create the district,
to assume the ultimate responsibility for administering the
district. A conservancy district may include territory from
one or more counties, and the conservancy court is composed
of one judge from the court of common pleas in each county
having territory within the conservancy district.
In 1966 the Pine Creek Conservancy District was established in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter

6101. Appellants, who collectively are residents, property
owners, and taxpayers in the Pine. Creek District, brought the
present action, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and
alleging, inter alia, that chapter 6101 is unconstitutional.
Appellants leveled three constitutional challenges against
the statute in the District Court, and those claims have been
renewed in the instant appeal. First, they argue that it
violates due process for the conservancy courts to make the
decision as to whether the conservancy districts that they will
administer should be formed. Since the judges of the conservancy courts are entitled to special compensation for their
work on those courts, appellants contend that they have a
financial incentive to declare the proposed districts organized
and that, therefore, persons objecting to the formation of a
district are deprived of a hearing before an impartial judicial
officer. See Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57 (1972); Tumey
v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927). Second, appellants contend
that the composition of the conservancy courts violates the
one-man, one-vote principle of Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186
(1962), and Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964), because
the judges on those courts are selected without regard to the
size of the population that they represent. Third, appellants
argue that chapter 6101 permits the disenfranchisement of
freeholders affected by the decision to create a conservancy
district because the statute creates a presumption that a local
political body, such as a township, represents the views of
all persons within its jurisdiction whenever it supports a petition proposing the creation of a conservancy district.
A three-judge court rejected all of these claims on the
single ground that they were foreclosed by Orr v. Allen,
248 U. S. 35 (1918), aff'g 245 F. 486 (WD Ohio 1917),
a case in which we rejected a due process and equal protection attack on the statute challenged here. No. C-1-75-5
(W)D Ohio, July 6, 1976).
None of the issues presented in this case was raised or

passed upon in Orr. The appellant in Orr presented four
issues to this Court, none of which had anything to do
with the issues presented here. The appellant argued that the
challenged statute denied him judicial review, that it authorized an impairment of existing contracts, that it improperly conferred legislative powers on the judiciary, and
that it authorized a taking without compensation. Our
three-page memorandum opinion in Orr did not purport to
go beyond the issues raised by the appellant in that case.
By no stretch of the imagination can our decision in Orr
be thought to have silently dealt with issues which arose
and were decided in later cases such as Ward, Tumey, and

Reynolds v. Sims.
Because the court below gave no independent consideration
to the issues raised by appellants and relied exclusively on
Orr, although that case considered none of the issues now
presented, it is apparent that the merits of appellants' claims
have never been fully considered by any federal court. Without offering any view as to the relative merit of appellants'
contentions, it is fair to say that they are not insubstantial.
We therefore reverse the decision below and remand for a full
consideration of the issues presented by appellants.
So ordered.
TH. CHimF JUSTICE would note probable jurisdiction and
give plenary consideration to this appeal.

and MR. JUsTIE STzEWs join, dissenting.
The action the Court takes today in this appeal is unexplained and very likely inexplicable. The three-judge District
Court heard the case and rendered a final decision on the
merits. It concluded that our affirmance in Orr v. Allen,
248 U. S. 35 (1918), and principles of stare decisis, compelled
rejection of the constitutional challenges.

The opinion of the District Court sets forth every one of
the challenges detailed by the Court today, and it is clear
from its opinion that each of these claims was considered
and rejected by it. On appeal here from such a decision,
in the absence of relevant intervening circumstances, see,
e. g., Guste v. Jackson, ante, p. 399; Town of Lockport v.
Citizens for Community Action, 423 U. S. 808 (1975);
Weinberger v. Jobst, 419 U. S. 811 (1974), or procedural
irregularities in the District Court's consideration of the
case, e. g., Westby v. Doe, 420 U. S. 968 (1975), this Court
ordinarily either affirms, modifies, or reverses the judgment
of the District Court. But in this case it has chosen none
of these courses. Disagreeing with the District Court as
to the scope of Orr v. Allen, it remands for "full consideration" of claims based on cases decided since Orr, in the
teeth of the obvious fact that the District Court did consider these claims and rejected them.' I agree with the
Court that Orr does not afford an adequate basis for our affirming the District Court, although I am not nearly as certain
that it was not an adequate basis for the District Court's
decision. But even though the Members of this Court are
agreed that Orr is not authority for rejecting appellants'
claims based on Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186 (1962), and
Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927), that amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the reasoning of the
District Court on the merits of the case. We should treat
those claims. here now, rather than "remanding" to the District Court as if we were editing a law student's first draft
of a law review note.2
'Appellants' reply brief before the District Court amply argues that

Orr was not controlling because that case concerned other constitutional

challenges. Thus, the District Court was aware of the arguments this

Court now relies on for a remand.
2The judgment order entered in the case states: "This matter
came on for hearing by agreement of the parties upon the briefs of the
parties on the issues of constitutionality of various sections of Chapter

Believing as I do that we should reach and decide these
claims, I shall state briefly my reasons for concluding that
they are not sufficiently substantial to warrant setting the
case for argument, and that the judgment of the District
Court should be affirmed.
Appellants raise three constitutional objections. Two of
them are connected in the sense that they do not relate to the
operationof the Pine Creek Conservancy District, but, rather,
are objections solely to the formation of that district.3
The first of these contentions is that persons objecting to
the formation of a district are deprived of a hearing before
an impartial judicial officer.4 The second is that chapter
6101 of the Ohio Revised Code dealing with Conservancy Districts."
The District Court thus did canvass the contentions going to the merits,
and decided the issue, albeit on a ground not favored by the majority
of this Court. But there can be no contention that appellants were precluded from entering relevant evidence into the record, or precluded
from presenting a pertinent legal argument. Both parties, in essence,
presented all they wished to on the constitutional issues to the District
Court. Nor is there any hint that the factual record is in such a shape
as to preclude determination of the issues by this Court. I am simply
at a loss to explain this Court's curious remand.
3None of the named plaintiffs allege in their complaint that they were
residents at the time of the formation of the Conservancy District, although there are recitations in the body of the complaint that might indicate that at least some were residents at that time. Because of the
failure to allege residency in 1966, their standing to raise such contentions
is questionable.
4
Once the district is formed, the conservancy court has no incentive to
decide a particular fact situation one way or another, as their pay remains
the same in either case. The Jurisdictional Statement of appellants, however, suggests another, related attack:
"To receive payment of this per diem, of course, the treasury of the district must be full. The income of the district comes from assessments
based on appraisals which the court must approve or disapprove ... "
Yet this challenge is to the remote impact on funding from full town coffers, raised and rejected in Dugan v. Ohio, 277 U. S. 61 (1928). The
payments are paid out of assessments, which are the responsibility, in

6101 of the Ohio Revised Code permits disenfranchisement of freeholders to object to the formation of the district
if the local political body supported the petition.
The district was formed in 1966, and these two objections
were fully available to be raised at that time. This lawsuit
was not filed until 1975. Absent some persuasive demonstration of a reason for such delay, I would view such a leisurely
attack on the formation of a governmental body as barred by
laches. "There must be conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence, to call into action the powers of the court."
McKnight v. Taylor, 1 How. 161, 168 (1843). The appellants
seek not merely a reapportionment of the voting population
of the district, but a judicial declaration that its formation
was a nullity. Surely an attack on the formation of an organ
of government is one of the situations where "both the nature
of the claim and the situation of the parties was such as to call
for diligence." Benedict v. City of New York, 250 U. S. 321,
328 (1919). There has been no such diligence here, and
neither the pleadings nor the proof intimates any excuse for
the delay.
These two challenges, I believe, fare no better on the
merits. The first, again, challenges the constitutionality, under Tumey v. Ohio, supra, of having court of common pleas
judges decide whether the district should be formed, since,
under § 141.07 of the Ohio Revised Code Ann. (Page 1975
Supp.), they will receive extra compensation if such district
is formed. Neither Tumey nor Ward v. Monroeville, 409
U. S.57 (1972), has any direct bearing on the constitutionality of the Ohio procedure for forming a conservancy district.
As Tumey and Ward made clear, those cases involved quintessentially judicial functions, see, e. g., Tumey, supra, at
the first instance, of the board of directors of the district, not the conservancy court, see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§ 6101A5, 6101.48 (Page 1975
Supp.). This issue surely raises no further challenge not worthy of a
summary affirmance.

522.1 Here, however, the determinations, although made by
judges, are essentially legislative in nature. As Mr. Justice
Holmes recognized, the determination of legislative facts does
not necessarily implicate the same considerations as does the
determination of adjudicative facts. Londoner v. Denver,
2103U. S. 373 (1908); Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State
Bd. of Equalization, 239 U. S. 441 (1915). Since I know
of no constitutional objection to the formation of such districts through legislative or executive action-without giving
opposing citizens a chance to air their objections, see Houck
v. Little River Dist., 239 U. S. 254, 262 (1915)-I see no
constitutional objection to the procedures followed here.
Those procedures simply insured an additional check on the
process of formation, already petitioned for by the town governments, and the fact that they may not have been before
an "impartial" judicial officer offends no constitutional right
of appellants.
The second "formation" challenge, as presented by appellants, raises the following issue:
"Section 6101.05, Ohio Revised Code, submits the
first decision in the creation of a conservancy district to
the freeholders, who must petition for its creation. This
is the only step in the entire procedure which calls for
any participation in support or opposition, by the residents or landowners, to the creation of the district or the
execution of its projects .... Section 6101.05, Ohio Revised Code, provides that the petition may be signed by
the governing body of any public corporation in the
proposed district. When such a public corporation signs

In Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U. S. 564, 579 (1973), where the pro-

ceeding was adjudicative in nature, but not criminal, we discussed whether
the "pecuniary interest of the members . . . had sufficient substance
to disqualify them ... ." (Emphasis supplied.) Here, of course, the
proceeding is more legislative than adjudicative, and is neither criminal
nor stigmatizing.

the petition, all freeholders within it are conclusively
presumed to favor creation of the district. In effect, all
persons living in the three townships and one village
which signed the petition who opposed the district were
deprived of the right to oppose the district." Jurisdictional Statement 13-14.
This constitutional challenge is wholly insubstantial. I know
of nothing, and appellants suggest nothing, which would even
arguably make the issue one that freeholders were constitutionally entitled to vote on. Thus, had the statute simply
allowed the governing bodies of the respective townships to
form such a district, there is surely no constitutional objection simply because the populace did not vote, Houck v.
Little River District, supra, at 262, 264. To the extent
the claim here protests the "discrimination" against the freeholders in a town whose governing body signs the petition,
in that they "were deprived of the right to oppose the district," it is simply wrong on the facts. There is no conclusive presumption, when the governing body signs a petition,
that "all freeholders . . . favor creation of the district."
Rather, opposing freeholders in such towns remain as free as
opposing freeholders in towns where petitions are circulated,
to appear before the conservancy court and "object to the
organization and incorporation of said district . . . ." Ohio
Rev. Code Ann. § 6101.08 (Page 1975 Supp.). They are entitled to no more under the Constitution.
Appellants raise one other objection to the constitutionality of the statutory scheme, although not limited exclusively
to the formation of the district. This is the claim that the
selection of judges for the conservancy court violates the
one-man, one-vote principle of Baker v. Carr, supra, and its
progeny. But the one-man, one-vote decisions do not apply
to the selection of judges, Wells v. Edwards, 347 F. Supp. 453
(MD La. 1972), aff'd, 409 U. S.1095 (1973). As the majority of the functions of the conservancy court are admittedly

J., dissenting

judicial, see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§ 6101.07, 6101.28, 6101.33
(Page 1975 Supp.), the majority of such a one-man, one-vote
challenge has already been squarely rejected by Wells. With
respect to the remaining functions, essentially legislative or
executive in nature, the scope of powers granted to a conservancy district itself are so narrowly confined as not to call
into play the strict application of one-man, one-vote doctrines.
Conservancy districts, established solely for flood prevention
and control, do not exercise "general governmental powers," as
that phrase was defined in Avery v. Midland County, 390 U. S.
474 (1968). Rather, flood control is a "special limited
purpose," much like that found in Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare
Water Dist., 410 U. S. 719 (1973), and, likewise, "the popular election requirements enunciated by Reynolds [v. Sims,
377 U. S. 533 (1964)] and succeeding cases are inapplicable .... ." Id., at 730. In such a situation, where both counties
have an interest, and there is no evidence of discrimination
against any group, see Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23
(1968), such a selection process is permissible, Salyer Land
Co. v. Tulare Water Dist., supra; cf. Hunter v. City of
Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161 (1907)o As I am unable to conclude that the decision to have one judge for each affected
county is "wholly irrelevant to achievement of the regulation's
objectives," Kotch v. River Port Pilot Comm'rs, 330 U. S.
552, 556 (1947), I would also reject this challenge and affirm
the judgment of the District Court.
6We are told that the Pine Creek Conservancy District lies partially
in Lawrence County and partially in Scioto County. We are told that
the 1970 population was 56,868 and 76,951, respectively. We are also
told that "[i]n neither instance is the entire county included in the district." We are not told, however, how much of either county is in the
district, nor how many freeholders reside in either county. It would
seem to follow that appellants fail in their burden of showing that "the
voting power of the judges" has not been approximated "to the number
of people they represent, or to the land or people within the district
which they represent."
