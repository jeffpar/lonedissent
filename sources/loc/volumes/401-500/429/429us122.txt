OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Per Curiam

429 U. S.

DAVIS v. GEORGIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT
OF GEORGIA

No. 76-5403.

Decided December 6, 1976

Petitioner's death sentence for murder cannot be carried out where one
prospective juror was excluded from the jury for cause for merely
expressing scruples against the death penalty, rather than being irrevocably committed to vote against it. Witherspoon v. llinois, 391

U. S. 510.
Certiorari granted; 236 Ga. 804, 225 S. E. 2d 241, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The petitioner in this case was convicted of murder and
sentenced to death after trial by a jury selected in violation
of the standards enunciated in Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391
U. S. 510 (1968), and applied in Boulden v. Holman, 394 U. S.
478 (1969), and Maxwell v. Bishop, 398 U. S. 262 (1970).
The Witherspoon case held that "a sentence of death cannot
be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was
chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they
voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed
conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction." 391
U. S., at 522.
The Supreme Court of Georgia found that one prospective
juror had been excluded in violation of the Witherspoon
standard. The court nevertheless affirmed the conviction
and death sentence, reasoning that the erroneous exclusion
of one death-scrupled juror did not deny the petitioner a
jury representing a cross section of the community since other
jurors sharing that attitude were not excused for cause:
"The rationale of Witherspoon and its progeny is not violated
where merely one of a vqualified class or group is excluded
where it is shown, as here, that others of such group were
qualified to serve. This record is completely void of any

evidence of a systematic and intentional exclusion of a qualified group of jurors so as to deny the appellant a jury of
veniremen representing a cross section of the community."
236 Ga. 804, 809-810, 225 S. E. 2d 241, 244-245.
That, however, is not the test established in Witherspoon,
and it is not the test that this Court has applied in subsequent cases where a death penalty was imposed after the
improper exclusion of one member of the venire. See Wigglesworth v. Ohio, 403 U. S. 947 (1971), rev'g 18 Ohio St. 2d
171, 248 N. E. 2d 607 (1969); Harrisv. Texas, 403 U. S. 947
(1971), rev'g 457 S. W. 2d 903 (Tex. Crim. App. 1970);
Adams v. Washington, 403 U. S. 947 (1971), rev'g 76 Wash. 2d
650, 458 P. 2d 558 (1969). Unless a venireman is "irrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the
penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances
that might emerge in the course of the proceedings," 391
U. S., at 522 n. 21, he cannot be excluded; if a venireman is
improperly excluded even though not so committed, any subsequently imposed death penalty cannot stand.
Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and the petition for certiorari are granted, the judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

and MR. JUSTICE BLAcQKMUN join, dissenting.
As is clear from the most cursory reading, Witherspoon
v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968), does not inexorably lead to
the result this Court now reaches. Indeed, much of the language in that opinion would support the reasoning, and the
result, reached by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The extension of Witherspoon to cover the case where a sole venireman is excluded in violation of its test deserves plenary
consideration, not a per se rule that precludes application

of even the harmless-error test of Chapman v. California,386
U. S. 18 (1967). There is no indication that the Supreme
Court of Georgia was wrong when it observed that the
"record is completely void of any evidence of a systematic
and intentional exclusion of a qualified group of jurors so
as to deny the appellant a jury of veniremen representing
a cross section of the community," 236 Ga. 804, 809-810, 225
S. E. 2d 241, 245.
It is, moreover, unclear whether the State was entitled
to another peremptory challenge,* and surely Witherspoon
does not decide whether the presence of unexercised peremptory challenges might render harmless the improper exclusion
of a limited number of veniremen. Finally, the defect in
this case is not that a juror was improperly excluded because
she was not irrevocably opposed to the death penalty; rather,
the defect is a failure to question sufficiently to determine
whether or not she was irrevocably opposed. It is not inconceivable that a hearing with the excluded juror could
be conducted now to finish the aborted questioning and
determine whether she would have, in fact, been excludable
for cause.
The effects of the arguably improper exclusion, in short,
are too murky to warrant summary reversal of the sentence
imposed. Since I do not believe this case is controlled by
our past decisions, I would grant certiorari and set the case
for argument.

*Normally, the defense, in a capital case, is entitled to 20 peremptory
challenges, and the State is entitled to one-half as many as the defense.

Ga. Code Ann. ยง 59-805 (1965). In this case, the transcript reveals that
the defense utilized 21 peremptory challenges; the State, 10.
