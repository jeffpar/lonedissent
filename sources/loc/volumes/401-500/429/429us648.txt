DONOVAN v. PENN SHIPPING CO., INC.,
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO TE

ET AL.

UNITED STATES

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

No. 76-613.

Decided February 22, 1977

A plaintiff in federal court, whether prosecuting a state or federal cause of
action, may not appeal from a remittitur order he has accepted. Hence,
where petitioner seaman in his action under the Jones Act for injuries
sustained on board ship accepted "under protest" a reduced verdict
when the District Court ordered a new trial on damages unless
petitioner agreed to a remittitur, the Court of Appeals properly dismissed petitioner's appeal from such order on the ground that a plaintiff cannot "protest" a remittitur he has accepted in an attempt to
open it to challenge on appeal.
Certiorari granted; 536 F. 2d 536, affirmed.

PER CuJIAM.

The petitioner, while employed by the respondents as a
seaman on the SS Penn Sailor, slipped on wet paint, injuring
his right wrist and elbow. He sued the respondents under the
Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. ยง 688, and obtained a $90,000 verdict
at his jury trial. The respondents moved to set aside the
verdict as excessive. Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 50, 59. The
District Court granted the motion, and ordered a new trial on
damages unless the petitioner agreed to remit $25,000 of the
$90,000 award.
After some time the petitioner submitted to the District
Court a proposed order stating that he accepted "under protest" the reduced verdict of $65,000, but reserving nonetheless
"his right to appeal therefrom." This language was adopted
by the District Court in entering a judgment for the petitioner
in the amount of $65,000.
The petitioner sought appellate review of the District
Court's decision to order a conditional new trial. In so doing
he asked the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to

discard the settled rule that a plaintiff who has accepted a
remittitur may not appeal to seek reinstatement of the original verdict. The Court of Appeals refused the petitioner's
invitation, and dismissed the appeal. 536 F. 2d 536.
The Court of Appeals properly followed our precedents in
holding that a plaintiff cannot "protest" a remittitur he has
accepted in an attempt to open it to challenge on appeal. A
line of decisions stretching back to 1889 has firmly established
that a plaintiff cannot appeal the propriety of a remittitur
order to which he has agreed. Kennon v. Gilmer, 131 U. S.
22, 29-30 (1889); Lewis v. Wilson, 151 U. S. 551, 554-555
(1894); Koenigsberger v. Richmond Silver Mining Co., 158
U. S. 41, 52 (1895); Woodworth v. Chesbrough, 244 U. S. 79,
82 (1917).
There are decisions in the Federal Courts of Appeals that
depart from these unbroken precedents. Those decisions held
or intimated that a plaintiff who accepts a remittitur "under
protest" may challenge on appeal the correctness of the
remittitur order. See, e. g., Bonn v. Puerto Rico Int'l Airlines, Inc., 518 F. 2d 89, 94 (CA1 1975); United States v.
1160.96 Acres of Land, 432 F. 2d 910 (CA5 1970); Gorsalitz v.
Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp., 429 F. 2d 1033 (CA5 1970);
Steinberg v. Indemnity Ins. Co. of North America, 364 F. 2d
266 (CA5 1966); Delta Engineering Corp. v. Scott, 322 F. 2d
11, 15 (CA5 1963). Other decisions have suggested that
when entertaining cases pursuant to its diversity jurisdiction,
a federal court should look to state practice to determine
whether such an appeal is permitted. See Burnett v. Coleman Co., 507 F. 2d 726 (CA6 1974); Manning v. Altec, Inc.,
488 F. 2d 127 (CA6 1973); Mooney v. Henderson Portion
Pack Co., 334 F. 2d 7 (CA6 1964).
The proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the
federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is, however, a matter of federal law, see Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U. S.
460, 466-469 (1965); Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Coop.,

356 U. S. 525 (1958), and that law has always prohibited
appeals in the situation at bar. The Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit correctly adhered to the consistent rule established by this Court's decisions. In order to clarify whatever
uncertainty might exist, we now reaffirm the longstanding rule
that a plaintiff in federal court, whether prosecuting a state or
federal cause of action, may not appeal from a remittitur
order he has accepted.
The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and the
judgment is affirmed.
So ordered.
TRn CHmF JusTicE and MR. JUsTIcE BLA CKMUN would
grant the petition for certiorari but would have the case
argued and given plenary consideration rather than disposed
of summarily.
