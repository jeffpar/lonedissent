STANDARD OIL CO. OF CALIFORNIA v.
UNITED STATES
ON MOTION TO RECALL MANDATE
No. 72-12ZI. Decided October 18, 1976
On motion to recall Supreme Court mandate affirming a District Court
judgment against movant, and for leave to file a motion under Fed. Rule
Civ. Proc. 60 (b), the motion to recall is denied because the District
Court may take appropriate action on the Rule 60 (b) motion without
leave of this Court.
PER CURIAM.

Following an eight-day trial, the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California enjoined movant
from engaging in certain practices found to violate § 3 of the
Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 3. 362
F. Supp. 1331 (1973).
The judgment was summarily affirmed by this Court. 412 U. S. 924. Movant now seeks
to have the judgment set aside on the basis of alleged
misconduct by Government counsel and by a material witness who is now prosecuting a treble-damages action against
movant. Preliminarily to filing a motion in the District
Court pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60 (b), movant has
filed a motion in this Court requesting that we recall our
mandateI and grant leave to proceed in the District Court.
We hold that the District Court may entertain a Rule 60 (b)
motion without leave by this Court. We therefore deny the
motion to recall our mandate, without prejudice to Standard
Oil's right to proceed in the District Court.
I It is technically incorrect to refer to our "mandate" because a copy of
the judgment was issued in lieu of a mandate. See this Court's Rule
59 (3). Nevertheless, to avoid confusion with the District Court judgment, we will use the term "mandate" throughout this opinion.

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Per Curiam

429 U. S.

We recognize that in the past both this Court and many
Courts of Appeals have required appellate leave before the
District Court could reopen a case which had been reviewed
on appeal. The requirement derived from a belief that an
appellate court's mandate bars the trial court from later disturbing the judgment entered in accordance with the mandate.

See In re Potts, 166 U. S. 263 (1897); Butcher &

Sherrerd v. Welsh, 206 F. 2d 259, 262 (CA3

been argued that the appellate-leave requirement

protects the

finality of the judgment and allows the appellate court to
screen out frivolous Rule 60 (b) motions. Tribble v. Bruin,
279 F. 2d 424, 427-428 (CA4 1960); 7 J. Moore, Federal
Practice 60.30 [2], p. 429 n. 27 (1975).
In our view, the arguments in favor of requiring appellate

leave are unpersuasive.

Like the original district court

judgment, the appellate mandate relates to the record and
issues then before the court, and does not purport to deal
with possible later events. Hence, the district judge is not
flouting the mandate by acting on the motion. See 11 C.

Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2873,
pp. 269-270 (1973).

Cf. SEC v. Advance Growth Capital

2This Court held that appellate leave was required in In re Potts,
166 U. S. 263 (1897), and spoke approvingly of the practice in HazelAtlas Co. v. Hartford Co., 322 U. S. 238, 248 (1944). The appellateleave requirement has also been approved by several Court of Appeals
decisions, in addition to those cited in the paragraph of the text accompanying this footnote. See Wilson Research Corp. v. Piolite Plastics
Corp., 336 F. 2d 303, 305 (CAI 1964); Hartmanv. Lauchli, 304 F. 2d 431,
432-433 (CA8 1962) (alternative holding). On the other hand, the Tenth
Circuit has rejected the requirement, Kodekey Electronics, Inc. v.
Mechanex Corp., 500 F. 2d 110, 112-113 (1974); Wilkin v. Sunbeam Corp.,
405 F. 2d 165 (1968), and the Seventh Circuit has recently indicated
that it now "would probably not go so far as to hold that appellate
leave is necessary whenever relief is sought under Rule 60 (b)(5)," SEC
v. Advance Growth Capital Corp., 539 F. 2d 649, 650 (1976).

Corp., 539 F. 2d 649, 650 (CA7 1976). Furthermore, the
interest in finality is no more impaired in this situation than
in any Rule 60 (b) proceeding. Finally, we have confidence
in the ability of the district courts to recognize frivolous
Rule 60 (b) motions. Indeed, the trial court "is in a much
better position to pass upon the issues presented in a motion
pursuant to Rule 60 (b)," Wilkin v. Sunbeam Corp., 405 F.
2d 165, 166 (CA10 1968). Accord, Wilson Research Corp. v.
Piolite Plastics Corp., 336 F. 2d 303, 305 (CAI 1964); 11
Wright & Miller, supra, at 269.
The appellate-leave requirement adds to the delay and
expense of litigation and also burdens the increasingly scarce
time of the federal appellate courts. We see no reason to
continue the existence of this "unnecessary and undesirable
clog on the proceedings," S. C. Johnson & Son, Inc. v. Johnson, 175 F. 2d 176, 184 (CA2 1949) (Clark, J., dissenting).
We therefore deny the motion to recall because the District
Court may take appropriate action without this Court's leave.
