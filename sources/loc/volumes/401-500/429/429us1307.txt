NEW YORK ET AL. v. KLEPPE, SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR, ET AL.
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY

No. A-150. Decided August 19, 1976
Application to vacate the Court of Appeals' stay of the District Court's
order preliminarily enjoining the Secretary of the Interior from opening

sealed bids for oil and gas leases of submerged lands under the MidAtlantic Outer Continental Shelf on the ground that the environmental
impact statement (EIS) required by the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (NEPA) before the leasing program could go forward was

materially deficient, is denied absent "exceptional circumstances" warranting a Circuit Justice's vacating a stay. It is not clear that the
question whether the EIS complied with the NEPA would warrant
review by this Court, nor is it necessary for a Circuit Justice to act "to
preserve the rights of the parties pending the final determination of the
cause," Meredith v. Fair,83 S. Ct. 10, 11, 9 L. Ed. 2d 43, 44.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, Circuit Justice.

On Friday, August 13, 1976, the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York preliminarily
enjoined the Secretary of the Interior from proceeding with
plans to open, on August 17, 1976, sealed bids due to be
submitted for oil and gas leases of submerged lands under the
Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf. On Monday, August
16, 1976, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit stayed the District Court's order. The State of New
York, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the counties of Suffolk and Nassau, plaintiffs in the District Court,
applied to me as Circuit Justice to vacate the stay. After
holding oral argument, I concluded that the extraordinary
relief they requested was not warranted.
I
The facts are exhaustively stated in the opinion of the
District Court, and can be summarized briefly here. In

OCTOBER TERM, 1976
Opinion in Chambers

429 U. S.

January 1974, President Nixon directed the Department of
the Interior to rapidly lease Outer Continental Shelf lands
for mining of oil and natural gas. In accordance with
this directive, the Department of the Interior prepared a
preliminary environmental impact statement (EIS), held
hearings on the statement, and in July 1975 issued a final
impact statement, as required by § 102 (2) (C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 853, 42
U. S. C. § 4332 (2) (C), On September 29, 1975, the Acting
Secretary announced his decision to adopt the accelerated oiland gas-leasing programs.
One of the areas to be leased under the accelerated program
is an area designated as Mid-Atlantid Sale No. 40, consisting
of lands off the coasts of New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Maryland, and Virginia. In August 1975, the Secretary announced which tracts within the area would be leased. A new
EIS devoted specifically to Sale No. 40 was drafted, hearings
were held in January 1976, and a final, four-volume EIS was
issued in May 1976. On July 16, 1976, a notice of the proposed
lease sale was published in the Federal R~egister, 41 Fed. Reg.
29437. Pursuant to the notice, sealed bids were to be submitted for each tract on a cash bonus basis, accompanied by
one-fifth of the cash bonus in cash or by cashier's check, bank
draft, certified check, or money order. The bids were due by
9:30 a. m., August 17, 1976, and were to be opened beginning
at 10 a. m.; the notice stated that if the bids were not opened
by midnight, they would be returned unopened to the bidder.
Ibid. After opening the bids, the Secretary has 30 days
to accept the highest bid, ibid., see 43 CFR § 3302.5 (1975); if
no bid is accepted within 30 days, all bids are deemed
rejected, ibid. Once a bid is accepted, the bidder must sign a
lease within a specified time or forfeit his deposit. Ibid.
The lease grants the lessee the exclusive right to drill for,
remove, and dispose of oil and gas deposits in the leased lands;
however, the lessee must submit all exploratory drilling plans

and development plans to the supervisor of the lease for
approval. 30 CFR § 250.34 (1975).
Prior to the publication of the notice of the lease sale, the
plaintiffs instituted the instant action to enjoin the lease sale on
the ground that the final EIS did not comply with the requirements of the NEPA. After 11 days of hearings the District
Court issued a comprehensive opinion. In most respects, the
Court found the EIS to be adequate, indeed "[i]f anything . . . too detailed and encyclopedic for a lay executive
to fully comprehend." Nos. 76C1229 and 75C208 (EDNY
Aug. 13, 1976). On one issue, however-an issue raised
by the court sua sponte during the hearings-the court found
the EIS materially deficient: it failed, in the court's view, to
adequately analyze state laws governing the use of shorelines,
and to evaluate "the probable extent of state cooperation
[with] or opposition" to the offshore exploration program. To
the contrary, the court found that the EIS assumed that the
States would grant rights-of-way for pipelines on shorelands,
thereby obviating the need for the lessees to use tankers to
transport the oil and minimizing the risk of oil spills. The
court concluded that as a result of this single omission, there
was a likelihood that plaintiffs would succeed on the merits in
demonstrating a violation of the NEPA, and it found that
plaintiffs would be irreparably injured if the Secretary were
permitted to grant the leases without prior compliance with
the NEPA. Accordingly, the court issued a preliminary
injunction.
The Secretary, joined by the National Ocean Industries
Association which had intervened on the side of the Secretary,
appealed the District Court's order and requested that the
injunction be stayed. After hearing oral argument, the
Court of Appeals granted the stay. In a brief per curiam
opinion, the Court of Appeals stated:
"We find nothing in this case which satisfies us that
the August 17, 1976 sale, in and of itself, will cause

appellees any irreparable injury. On the other hand,
the national interests, looking toward relief of this country's energy crisis, will be clearly damaged if the proposed
sale is aborted." No. 76-8369 (CA2 Aug. 16, 1976).
II
The power of a Circuit Justice to dissolve a stay is well
settled. See, e. g., Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U. S. 1304,
1308 (1973) (M1VsBALL,J., in chambers); Meredith v. Fair,
.83 S. Ct. 10, 9 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1962) (Black, J., in chambers);
Cunningham v. English, 78 S. Ct. 3, 2 L. Ed. 2d 13 (1957)
(Warren, C. J., in chambers). But it is equally well established that a Circuit Justice should not disturb, "except upon
the weightiest considerations, interim determinations of the
Court of Appeals in matters pending before it." O'Rourke v.
Levine, 80 S.Ct. 623, 624, 4 L. Ed. 2d 615, 616 (1960) (Harlan,
J., in chambers). This is especially true where, as here, I had
only a few hours to review the District Court's 200-page
opinion, the briefs of the parties, and the four-volume EIS,
and where I did not have before me-nor could I have meaningfully considered even if it were here-the voluminous
record compiled in the District Court.
Perhaps the most compelling justification for a Circuit
Justice to upset an interim decision by a court of appeals
would be to protect this Court's power to entertain a petition
for certiorari before or after the final judgment of the Court
of Appeals. See R. Stern & E. Gressman, Supreme Court
Practice § 17.19 (4th ed. 1969). Despite the practical importance of the Secretary of the Interior's decision to issue leases
for the Mid-Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, however, I am
not persuaded that the legal question involved here-whether
this EIS complied with the uncontested requirements of the
NEPA-would warrant review by this Court. Just this past
Term, in Kleppe v. Sierra Club, 427 U. S. 390 (1976), we
had occasion to examine the purposes and requirements of
the NEPA. Although we disagreed on certain issues, we were

NEW YORK v. KLEPPE
1307

Opinion in Chambers

unanimous in concluding that the essential requirement of
the NEPA is that before an agency takes major action, it must
have taken "a 'hard look' at environmental consequences."
427 U. S., at 410 n. 21, quoting Natural Resources Defense
Council v. Morton, 148 U. S. App. D. C. 5, 16, 458 F. 2d 827,
838 (1972). In evaluating the adequacy of EIS's the Courts
of Appeals consistently have enforced this essential requirement, tempered by a practical "rule of reason." I As the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has explained:
"[An EIS is required to furnish only such information
as appears to be reasonably necessary under the circumstances for evaluation of the project rather than to be
so all-encompassing in scope that the task of preparing
it would become either fruitless or well nigh impossible."
NaturalResources Defense Council v. Callaway, 524 F. 2d
79, 88 (1975).
In the instant case, respondents do not appear to challenge
the requirement that the agency take a "hard look" at the
environmental consequences, nor do applicants question the
appropriateness of employing a rule of reason in evaluating
impact statements. Thus, the sole question at issue is
whether the District Court properly applied the controlling
standards in concluding that the EIS lacked information
concerning state regulation of shorelands which was "reasonably necessary" for evaluating the project. That question
appropriately is for the Court of Appeals, and I do not believe
that four Members of this Court would vote to grant a writ
of certiorari to review its conclusion on such a fact-intensive
issue. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for me to exercise my

'See, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, 510 F. 2d 813, 819 (CA5 1975);
Trout Unlimited v. Morton, 509 F. 2d 1276, 1283 (CA9 1974); Harlem
Valley Transportation Assn. v. Stafford, 500 F. 2d 328,337 (CA2 1974);

extraordinary powers as Circuit Justice in order to preserve
a question for review by the full Court.
Nor is it necessary for me to act in this case "to preserve
the rights of the parties pending final determination of the
cause." Meredith v. Fair,83 S. Ct., at 11, 9 L. Ed. 2d, at 44.
The Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiffs would not be
irreparably injured if the Secretary were permitted to open the
bids. I cannot say that the court abused its discretion. It is
axiomatic that if the Government, without preparing an adequate impact statement, were to make an "irreversible commitment of resources," Natural Resources Defense Council v.
NRC, 539 F. 2d 824, 844 (CA2 1976), a citizen's right to have
environmental factors taken into account by the decisionmaker would be irreparably impaired. For this reason, the
lower courts repeatedly have enjoined the Government from
making such resource commitments without first preparing
adequate impact statements2 Indeed this past Term, in
Kleppe v. Sierra Club, supra,we indicated that it would have
been appropriate for the Court of Appeals to have enjoined
the approval of mining plans had that court concluded that
"the impact statement covering [the mining plans] inadequately analyzed the environmeital impacts of, and the alternatives to, their approval." 427 U. S., at 407-408, n. 16.
In the instant case, however, the Court of Appeals apparently decided that the opening of bids does not constitute an
"irreversible commitment of resources." I am unprepared to
say that the court was wrong in so holding. In the first
instance, it is quite clear that the actual opening of the bids
does not involve a commitment of any kind, since the Secretary reserves the right to reject all bids. Thus it is not until

Comm. v. AEC, 146 U. S. App. D. C. 33, 52, 449 F. 2d 1109, 1128 (1971).

a bid is accepted-which may not happen for 30 days-that
an irreversible commitment is even arguably made.3 Moreover, even after the bids are accepted, I cannot say that the
Court of Appeals would be without power to declare the
leases invalid if the court determined that the Government
entered into leases without compliance with the requirements
of the NEPA.
For the foregoing reasons, I have concluded that this case
does not present the "exceptional circumstances," Holtzman
v. Schlesinger, 414 U. S., at 1308, that warrant a Circuit
Justice to vacate a stay.

3

In the instant case, it is possible that before the bids are accepted the
District Court will decide that the defect in the EIS has been remedied
by a supplemental affidavit prepared by the Secretary in response to the
court's opinion. That affidavit was presented to the Court of Appeals as
an appendix to the Government's brief; it was also presented to me, but
because it had not yet been given to the District Court, I declined to consider it. I was informed at argument, however, that the affidavit discusses the extent to which the Secretary considered the possibility of lack
of state cooperation in making his decision to approve Sale No. 40.
