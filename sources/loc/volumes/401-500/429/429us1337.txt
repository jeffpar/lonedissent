NIZER ET AL.

ON APPLICATION FOR ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF NECESSITY

No. A-543.

Decided January 18, 1977

Title 28 U. S. C. § 291 (a) authorizes THE Cmp JusTicE to designate
temporarily any circuit judge to act in another circuit upon presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit justice.
Application to a Circuit Justice for a certificate of necessity under
§ 291 (a) requesting that Tm CHimF JusTICE designate judges from
other circuits to sit in applicants' appeal to Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit or for transfer of appeal to another court of appeals,
because of alleged disqualification of all Second Circuit judges, is denied.
Since § 291 (a) deals with a purely administrative matter, it would be
inappropriate for a Circuit Justice to rule on an application under it
that all Second Circuit judges are as a matter of law disqualified from
hearing the appeal, and moreover a Circuit Justice does not have the
power to unseat all the judges of a court of appeals in a particular case,
absent any showing that they have recused themselves, or to transfer the
appeal to another court.

MR. JUSTICE MisHALL, Circuit Justice.
Applicants Michael and Robert Meeropol brought this
action in the District Court for the Southern District of
New York against respondent Nizer, author of the book The
Implosion Conspiracy, and respondents Doubleday & Co. and
Fawcett Publications, its publishers, alleging copyright infringement, libel, and invasion of privacy. Summary judgment was granted for respondents on all claims, and applicants
have appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Applicants move before me as Circuit Justice to issue a certificate of necessity under 28 U. S. C. § 291 (a) or 28 U. S. C.
§ 1651, requesting THE CHIEF JUSTICE to designate judges
from other circuits to sit in the appeal of this case.1
I Applicants initially moved before the Second Circuit for en bane consideration of their request for issuance of a certificate of necessity or
transfer of the appeal to another circuit. That request was denied, with

Applicants are the sons of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,
who were executed in 1953 after their convictions for conspiracy to commit espionage. See United States v. Rosenberg, 195 F. 2d 583 (CA2), cert. denied, 344 U. S. 838 (1952);
Rosenberg v. United States, 346 U. S. 273 (1953). The gravamen of applicants' action is that the Nizer book infringed
the copyright which applicants own in the book Deathhouse
Letters of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and libeled and invaded
the privacy of applicants in its portrayal of the Rosenbergs'
relationship with their children. Applicants contend in this
motion that all of the judges of the Second Circuit are disqualified from hearing their appeal, essentially because they
are, in the words of Judge Mansfield's decision, "associates,"
"friends," and "consultants" of Chief Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the Second Circuit, who presided as a District Judge
over the Rosenberg trial and imposed the death sentences.2
Chief Judge Kaufman and Judge Oakes not participating. No application for a certificate of necessity was made to the Chief Judge. The
motion was then set down for a hearing before a panel of the Second
Circuit, and after some delay was heard by Judges Mansfield, Van
Graafeiland, and Meskill. At the conclusion of oral argument, the motion
was denied in an oral opinion delivered by Judge Mansfield, a transcript
of which is in the record before me.

Although applicants have specifically addressed this application to me
as Circuit Justice for the Second Circuit, and have not requested my
disqualification, I note that they do suggest that "any judges who sat on
any of the appeals of the Rosenbergs would very likely conclude that they
should disqualify themselves from the current appeal." Application 11.
I was a member of a Second Circuit panel, along with Judges Swan and
Friendly, which denied postconviction relief to Rosenberg codefendant
Morton Sobell. United States v. Sobell, 314 F. 2d 314 (CA2), cert.
denied, 374 U. S.857 (1963). Despite this, I will not disqualify myself
from ruling on the instant application. I do not believe that my
"impartiality" to decide the extent of a Circuit Justice's powers under
§ 291 (a) "might reasonably be questioned," 28 U. S. C. § 455 (a) (1970
ed., Supp. V), in light of this participation in a case not related to the
present action.

MEEROPOL v. NIZER
1337

Opinion in Chambers

As far as I can determine, 28 U. S. C. § 291 (a) I has never
been construed by this Court, although it is often used to
assign judges to temporary duty on the courts of appeals.
Generally such assignments are made to assist a circuit with a
heavy workload, although assignments have been made where
an entire court of appeals has disqualified itself from hearing
a case. See, e. g., United States v. Isaacs, 493 F. 2d 1124,
1167-1168 (CA7), cert. denied, 417 U. S. 976 (1974); cf, United
States v. Manton, 107 F. 2d 834 (CA2 1939), cert. denied,
309 U. S. 664 (1940). In such cases, however, the circuit
judges themselves make the decision not to sit, thereby making
it impossible to designate a panel to hear an appeal, and
causing the "need" under § 291 (a) for the issuance of a
certificate of necessity. Such need is plain to anyone looking
at the situation, and the duty to issue the certificate must
be considered purely a ministerial act to deal with an administrative problem, whether performed by the chief judge
of the circuit or the circuit justice. See "An Act to amend the
Judicial Code to authorize the Chief Justice of the United States
to assign circuit judges to temporary duty in circuits other
than their own," 56 Stat. 1094; H. R. Rep. No. 2501, 77th
Cong., 2d Sess. (1942); S. Rep. No. 1606, 77th Cong., 2d
Sess. (1942).
Because § 291 (a) deals with a purely administrative matter, it would be inappropriate for me to rule in the context of an application under it that all of the judges of
the Second Circuit are as a matter of law disqualified from
hearipg applicants' appeal. At best that question could be
addressed only by the full Court. Cf. Locks v. Commanding
General, 89 S. Ct. 31, 21 L. Ed. 2d 78 (1968) (Douglas, J., in
3 Section 291 (a) provides:
"The Chief Justice of the United States may designate and assign temporarily any circuit judge to act as circuit judge in another circuit upon

presentation of a certificate of necessity by the chief judge or circuit

justice of the circuit where the need arises."

chambers). Sitting as a Circuit Justice, I simply do not have
the power to unseat all of the judges of a court of appeals in
a particular case absent any showing that they have recused
themselves.
Applicants move in the alternative for transfer of their
appeal to another court of appeals. They have cited no statutory or case authority even intimating that a Circuit Justice
may exercise any such far-reaching power. See MacNeil Brosc
Co. v. Cohen, 264 F. 2d 186 (CAI 1959).
The application is denied in all respects.
