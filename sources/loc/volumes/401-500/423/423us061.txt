MENNA v. NEW YORK
ON

PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI

TO THE COURT OF

APPEALS OF NEW YORK

No. 75-5401.

Decided November 17, 1975

Petitioner's guilty plea to a charge of refusal to answer questions
before a grand jury after having been granted immunity held
not to bar his claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded
the State from haling him into court on that charge after he had
been sentenced to a jail term for contempt of court for his failure
to testify before the grand jury.
Certiorari granted; 36 N. Y. 2d 930, 335 N. E. 2d 848, reversed
and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

On November 7, 1968, after having been granted immunity, petitioner refused to answer questions put to him
before a duly convened Kings County, N. Y., grand jury
which was investigating a murder conspiracy. On
March 18, 1969, petitioner refused to obey a court order
to return to testify before the same grand jury in connection with the same investigation. On that date, petitioner was adjudicated in contempt of court under N. Y.
Jud. Law ยง 750 (1968) for his failure to testify before the
grand jury; and, on March 21, 1969, after declining an
offer to purge his contempt, petitioner was sentenced to
a flat 30-day term in civil jail. Petitioner served his
sentence.
On June 10, 1970, petitioner was indicted for his refusal to answer questions before the grand jury on November 7, 1968. After asserting unsuccessfully that this
indictment should be dismissed under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United
States Constitution, petitioner pleaded guilty to the indictment and was sentenced on his plea.

OCTOBER TERM, 1975
Per Curiam

423 U. S.

Petitioner appealed, claiming that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the State from haling him into
court on the charge to which he had pleaded guilty.'
The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction,
declining to address the double jeopardy claim on the
merits. It held, relying, inter alia, on Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258 (1973), that the double jeopardy claim
had been "waived" by petitioner's counseled plea of
guilty.
We reverse. Where the State is precluded by the
United States Constitution from haling a defendant into
court on a charge, federal law requires that a conviction
on that charge be set aside even if the conviction was
entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty. Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21, 30 (1974).2 The motion
1 The

State concedes that petitioner's double jeopardy claim is a
strong one on the merits. In light of the flat 30-day sentence
imposed, the earlier contempt adjudication was a criminal conviction,
People v. Colombo, 31 N. Y. 2d 947, 293 N. E. 2d 247 (1972), on
remand from Colombo v. New York, 405 U. S. 9 (1972), and New
York law supports the proposition that the earlier conviction was
based, at least in part, on the failure to answer questions on November 7, 1968, and was thus for the same crime as the one charged in
the instant indictment. In re Capio v. Justices of the Supreme

Court, 41 App. Div. 2d 235, 342 N. Y. S. 2d 100 (1973), aff'd, 34
N. Y. 2d 603, 310 N. E. 2d 547 (1974); People v. Matra, 42 App.
Div. 2d 865, 346 N. Y. S. 2d 872 (1973).
2 Neither Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258
(1973), nor our
earlier cases on which it relied, e. g., Brady v. United States, 397
U. S. 742 (1970), and McMann v. Richardson,397 U. S. 759 (1970),
stand for the proposition that counseled guilty pleas inevitably
"waive" all antecedent constitutional violations. If they did so hold,
the New York Court of Appeals might be correct. However, in
Tollett we emphasized that waiver was not the basic ingredient of
this line of cases, 411 U. S., at 266. The point of these cases is that
a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable
that, where voluntary and intelligent, it quite validly removes the
issue of factual guilt from the case. In most cases, factual guilt is

agrees that "[w]here the State
is precluded by the United States Constitution from
haling a defendant into court on a charge, federal law
requires that a conviction on that charge be set aside
even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty," ante, at 62, but on his view that
the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecution from
mounting successive prosecutions for offenses growing
out of the same criminal transaction, he believes that
the proper disposition of the case is not a remand but
outright reversal. See Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U. S. 436,
453-454 (1970) (BRENNAN, J., concurring).

THE CHIEF JUSTICE

a sufficient basis for the State's imposition of punishment. A guilty
plea, therefore, simply renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual
guilt and which do not stand in the way of conviction, if factual
guilt is validly established. Here, however, the claim is that the
State may not convict petitioner no matter how validly his factual
guilt is established. The guilty plea, therefore, does not bar the
claim.
We do not hold that a double jeopardy claim may never be
waived. We simply hold that a plea of guilty to a charge does
not waive a claim that-judged on its face-the charge is one which
the State may not constitutionally prosecute.
