HORTONVILLE JOINT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
ET AL.

v. HORTONVILLE EDUCATION
ASSOCIATION ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-133 (74-1606).

Decided August 18, 1975

Application for stay of Wisconsin Supreme Court judgment, holding
on due process grounds that a school board may not properly
dismiss teachers employed by it, denied, where it is not clear
whether that judgment rested upon the Fourteenth Amendment
alone or also upon the Wisconsin Constitution, and whether the
judgment was "final" for purposes of 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257.
See: 66 Wis. 2d 469, 225 N. W. 2d 658.

Circuit Justice.
If the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin
were plainly a "final judgment" for purposes of 28
U. S. C. ยง 1257, and if it plainly rested solely upon a
construction of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United
States Constitution, I would be inclined to grant the
stay requested by the applicant School Board. I think
that none of our cases requires the conclusion, reached
by the Wisconsin court, that a school board may not be
allowed to dismiss teachers whom it employs because it
is not the sort of impartial decisionmaker required by
due process of law. If this matter were before me on
the petition for certiorari where I would be casting my
vote as a Member of the Court, I would conclude that
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin did
rest solely upon the Fourteenth Amendment. But in

my capacity as Circuit Justice, where I act "as a surrogate for the entire Court," Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414

(MARSHALL, J., in chambers),

doubts as to whether the judgment may not rest also
upon a construction of the Wisconsin Constitution, and
as to the finality of the judgment,, lead me to deny the
application.
