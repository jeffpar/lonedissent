DOVE v. UNITED STATES

Per Curiam

DOVE v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

No. 75-543.

Decided January 19, 1976

Petitioner's death pending review by certiorari requires dismissal of
petition. Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481, overruled.
Certiorari dismissed. See 506 F. 2d 1398.
PER CURIAM.

The Court is advised that the petitioner died at New
Bern, N. C., on November 14, 1975. The petition for
certiorari is therefore dismissed. To the extent that
Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be
inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE

dissents.
