THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
AT

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
SATIACUM v. WASHINGTON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF. WASHINGTON

No. 72-552.

Decided October 15, 1973

State courts should have *determined where petitioner's alleged
offenses occurred with respect to boundaries of present or former
Indian reservation, since if they occurred outside those boundaries
the State Supreme Court unnecessarily reached a federal question
in deciding that the reservation as such had ceased to exist.
Certiorari granted; 80 Wash. 2d 492, 495 P. 2d 1035, vacated and

remanded.
PER CURIAM.

It appearing that petitioner might have been fishing
at a location outside the boundaries of what is, or was,
the Puyallup Indian Reservation when the acts with
which he is charged .were committed, and, if this wer6
so, that the Supreme Court of Washington then unnecessarily addressed, and determined, the federal question whether the Puyallup Reservation "has ceased to
exist," the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Washington is
vacated, and the ease is remanded to that court for
resolution by the state courts of the factual issue whether
the alleged offenses took place outside the boundaries
of what is, or was, the Reservation.
