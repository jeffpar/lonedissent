COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIANA ET AL. v. WHITCOMB, GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, ET AL.
"PEAL FROM. THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR HE
NORTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA

No. 72-1040.

Argued October 16, 1973-Decided January 9, 1974

The application of appellants (the Communist Party of Indiana,
certai of its officers and potential voters, and its candidates for
President and Vice President) for a place on the Indiana ballot
for the 1972 general election was rejected for failure to submit
a statutory loyalty oath stating that the Party "does not advocate
the overthrow of local, state or national government by force or
violence." Appellants, contending that the statute .was unconstitutional, thereupon filed this action in the District Court for
injunctive and declaratory relief. On September 28, 1972, a threejudge court declared the statute constitutional and ordered the
Election Board to place the Party on the ballot, but only if the
required oath was submitted. After a qualified oath submitted
by the Party was rejected, appellants on, October 3 sought a
District Court order directing the Board to accept such oath,
and on the same day the Board requested reconsideration of the
September 28 order. The next day 'the District Court denied
both motions. On October 10 appellants filed a notice of appeal
to this Court, which it later sought to withdraw so that the
District Court might act on appellants' motion of the same day
that .the September 28 order be amended in certain respects.
On October 31, the District Court allowed withdrawal of -;he
appeal notice but denied the motion to amend. Appellants refiled
their notice of appeal to this Court on November 29; which
appellees contend is untimely. Held:
1. Appellants' notice of appeal was within the 60-day appeal
period prescribed by 28 U. S. C. § 2101 (b), since appellees'
Octobdr 3 motion for reconsideration suspended the finality of
the September 28 judgment until the District Court's denial of,
such motion on October 4 restored it, so that the time for appeal
thus began to run from October 4. Pp. 445-446.
2. The loyalty oath requirement of the Indiana statute violates
the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Pp. 446-450.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

414 U. S.

(a) The principle that the constitutional guarantees of free
speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe
advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where
such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to produce such action, applies to state
regulation burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in
the political party of one's choice, casting an effective ballot, and
in running for office, which are interests as substantial as those
in other areas that this Court has protected against statutory
schemes contrary to the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Pp. 448-449.
(b) For purposes of determining whether to grant a place
on the ballot, a group advocating violent overthrow as abstract
doctrine need not be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful
action. Pp. 449-450.
Reversed.

delivered the opinion of the

Court.
This is a loyalty oath case. The question for decision is
whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments are violated by Indiana's requirement, Ind.Ann. Stat. § 29-3812
(1969), that "[n]o existing or newly-organized political party or organization shall be permitted on or to
have the names of its candidates printed on the ballot
used at any election until it has filed an affidavit, by its
officers, under oath, that it does not advocate the over-

Appellants are the Communist Party of Indiana, a
new political party inIndiana, certain1 of its officers and
potential voters, and its candidates for President and
Vice Presideit in the 1972 election. Appellees are the
Indiana State Election Board and its members; When
appellants applied to the Election Board in August 1972
for a place on Indiana's National Ballot for the 1972
general election without submitting the required -oath,
the Board, on the advice of the Attorney General of
Indiana, rejected the application. Appellants thereupon

Section, 29-3812 reads in pertinent .part as follows:
"No political party or organization shall be recognized and given
a place on or have the names of its candidates printed on the ballot
used at any election which advocates the overthrow, by force or
violence, of the local, state or national government, or which advocates, or carries on, a program of sedition or of, treason, and which
is affiliated or cooperates with or, has any relation with any foreign
government, or any political party or group of individuals of any
foreign government. Any political party or organization which is
in existence at the time of the passage of this act... or which shall
have had a ticket on the ballot one or more times prior to any
election, and which does not advocate any of the doctrines the advocacy bf which is prohibited by this act, shall insert a plank in its
platform that it does not advocate any of the doctrines prohibited
by this at. No existing -r newly-organized political party or organization shall be permitted on or to have the names of its candidates

stitutionality of § 29-3812, and an injunction requiring
that the Election Board place the Party on, the ballot.
A three-judge court was convened and that court, on
September 28, 1972, in an unreported opinion, declared
the provision of § 29-3812 that is challenged on this
appeal constitutional and issued an order requiring the
Election Board to place the Communist Party and its
nominees on the National Ballot only "[i]n the event that
the Communist Party of Indiana shall submit an affidavit
in keeping with this memorandum and order ... "2
The Communist Party submitted an affidaydt that,, in
addition to the statutory language, added the following:
"The term advocate as used herein has the meaning
given it by the Supreme Court of the United States
in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 at 320,
'the advocacy and teaching of concrete action for
the forcible overthrow of the government, and not
of principles divorced from action."'
The Election Board rejected the affidavit and appellants,
on October 3, returned to the District Court, seeking an
order directing the Board to accept it. On the same day,
2

The District Court's decision of September 28 also decided
attacks upon the loyalty oath provision of § 29-3812 made in actions
brought by two other new political parties, the American Independent Party and the Indiana Peace and Freedom Party. All three
actions" challenged, in addition to the "advocacy" provision, the provision of § 29-3812 requiring a party also to file an affidavit that
"it is not affiliated with and does not cooperate with nor has any
relation with any foreign government, or any political party, organization or group of individuals of any foreign government." The
September 28 memorandum of the three-judge court declared this
provision of § 29-3812 unconstitutional. The American Independent
Party and the Indiana Peace and Freedom Party then filed affidavits
accepted by the Election Board and were placed on the National
Ballot for the 1972 elections. On November 11, the Election Board
appealed that portion of the order to this Court. We summaril,
affirmed. Whitcomb v. Communist Party, 410 U. S. 976 (1973).

Opinion of the Court

the Election Board filed a motion requesting reconsiderThe District Court,
ation of the order of September 28
on October 4, denied both motions by order entered that
day. Appellants on October 10 filed a notice of appeal
to this Court to enable them to seek emergency relief.
That effort- was abandoned, and appellants then sought
leave of the District Court to withdraw"-the notice of
appeal in order that the District Court might act on a
motion of appellants, also filed October 10, that the
District Court amend its September 28 order to include
a determination that § 29-3812 was constitutional "only
insofar -as it.proscribes advocacy directed at promoting
unlawful action, as distinguished from advocacy of
abstract doctrine." On October 31, the District Court
entered an order granting leave to withdraw the notice
of appeal of October 10 but denying the motion to amend
the September 28 memorandum.
Appellants refiled their notice of appeal on November 29. Appellees moved to dismiss the appeal as jurisdictionally untimely, arguing that the 60-day period-for
appeal, -28 U. S. C. § 2101 (b), expired on November 27.
'We postponed -consideration of the question of our jurisdiction to the merits. 410,U. S. 981 (1973). We hold
that the appeal was timely. Appellees' motion for reconsideration of October 3 suspended the finality of the
judgment of September 28 until the District Court's
denial of the motion on October 4 restored it. Time
3Section 29-3801, Td. Stat .Ann. (1969), provides for ballot listing
of any party that files petitions containing signatures of one-half of
one Percent "of the total vote of all parties cast in the state for secretary of state at the last preceding general election."- The sufficiency
of the Communist Party petitions in this respect was challenged by'
appellees in the District Court but was not discussed in the court's
September 28 memorandum although the issuance of the injunction
presupposed a decision adverse to. appellees. The motion for
reconsideration requested the court to reconsider that result.

for appeal thus began to run from October 4 and the
notice of appeal filed November 29 was timely.' As to
the merits, we hold that the loyalty oath requirement
of § 29-3812 violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, 5 and therefore reverse the judgment of the District
Court.6
4 Appellees also argue that the notice of appeal of November 29
was ineffective because the earlier notice of October 10 divested the
District Court of jurisdiction and that that jurisdiction could not
have been revested by the granting of leave to withdraw the October 10 notice. But since the October 10 notice was clearly timely,
that argument is reduced to an attack on the untimeliness under
Supreme Court Rule 13 (1) of the filing of the jurisdictional statement on January 26, 1973. Timely docketing of the jurisdictional
statement is not, however, a jurisdictional requisite. Johnson v.
Florida, 391 U. S. 596, 598 (1968).
Appellees' brief also invokes § 3 of the Communist Control Act
of 1954, 68 Stat. 776, 50 U. S. C. § 842, providing that "[t]he Communist Party of the United States . . . [is] not entitled to any of the
rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies created
under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political
subdivision thereof.. . ." We have difficulty understanding appellees' argument that this statute is 'applicable to the Communist
Party of Indiana or in any way relevant to the issues in this case.
The statute was not relied upon by either the Election Board, or
the District Court when it denied declaratory relief. In any event,
insofar as the argument is that this statute bars the Communist
Party of Indiana from maintaining this action, it is rejected. See
Communist Party, U. S. -A. v. Catherwood, 367 U. S. 389 (1961).
5
Appellants also contend that the requirement is constitutionally
precluded as an bath different from that prescribed for a President
by Art. II, § 1, and for any other state or federal officer by Art. VI,
cl.3. See Cole v. Richardson, 405 U. S. 676 (1972). In view of
our result we need not address those contentions.
The only question presented in the jurisdictional statement is
whether § 29-3812 is facially valid. Thus, we do not reach the
question whether the Election Board's apparent failure to require
the Republican and Democratic Parties, the two major parties in
Indiana, to comply with the statute rises to the level of a denial.
of equal protection of the law as applied, or was within the Board's

Opinion of the Court

Loyalty oath cases are not strangers to this Court,.

see Note, Loyalty.aths, 77 Yale L. J.739 (1968), but the
constitutional questions presented .in earlier cases arising

from their use to limit access to the-ballot have not had

plenary consideration." The District Court decided this
case under the pressure of a ballot-printing deadline, and

its memoandum opinion states no reasons and cites no

authoiities to support the court's holding that "that portion of the statute providing-that it does not advocate the
overthrow of local, state or national government by force
or violence,' is constitutional and hence enforceable by
Indiana."

Appellees do not deny that § 29-3812 exacts a broad
oath embracing advocacy of abstract doctrine as well as
advocacy of action. Yet this Court has held. in many
contexts that the First and -Fourteenth Amendments

render invalid statutes regulating advocacy that are not
limited to advocacy of action. - And, as we have so

often emphasized, "[p]recision of regulation must be the
touchstone in an area so closely touching our most

precious freedorns'2

NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415.

438 (1963).
We most recently summarized the constitutional prin"prosecutorial discretion." We note, however, that the only relevant
testimony in the-District Court, given by the Board's clerk, is
entirely silent as to the reasons behind the omission.
1E. g., Lisker v, Kelley, 401 U. S. 928 (1971), summarily aff'g
315 F. Supp. -777 (1970); Gerende v. Board of Supervisors, 341U. S. 56 (1951), presenting a constitutional challenge to a Maryland
statute imposing a loyalty requirement on candidates for municipal
office rested on "the narrowing' construction tendered by the Attirney General [of Maryland] during oral argument so as to avoid
the constitutional issue that was argued." Whitehill v. Elkins, 389
U. S. 54, 58 (1967). And Socialist Labor Party v. Gilligan, 406
U. S. 583 (1972), Was dismissed as insufficiently concrete and
-nature to permit adjudication, on, the authority of Rescue Army v.
Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549 (1947).

ciples that have evolved in this area in Brandenburg v.
Ohio, 395 U. S. 444 (1969). We expressly overruled-the
earlier holding of Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357
(1927), that "without more, 'ad~rocating' violent means
to effect political and economic change involves such
danger to the security of the State that the State may
outlaw it." 395 U. S., at 447. For, we said:
!'[L]ater decisions have fashioned the principle
that the constitutional guarantees of free speech
and free press do not permit a State to forbid or
proscribe advocacy of the'use of force or of law
violation except where such advocacy is directed to
inciting or producing imminent lawless action and
is likely to incite or produce such action. As we said
in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 297--298
(1961), 'the mere abstract teaching ... of the moral
propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force
and violence, is not the same as preparing a group
for violent action and steeling it to such action.'...
A statute which fails to draw this distinction
impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It
sweeps within its condemnation speech which our
Constitution has immunized from governmental
control. Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298
(1957)

This principle that "the constitutional guarantees of
free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid
or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation .except where such advocacy is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite
or produce such action" has been applied not only to statutes that directly forbid or proscribe advocacy, see Scales

determine eligibility for public employment, Keyishian
v. Board of Regents,, 385 U. S.589 (1967); Elfbrandt v.
Russell, 384 U. S.11 (1966); Cramp v. Board of Public
Instruction, 368 U. S. 278 (1961); see also United States

v. Randall,*357 U. S. 513 (1958); and moral fitnessjustifying disbarment, Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 (1957).
Appellees argue that the principle should nevertheless
not obtain in cases of state regulation of access to the
ballot. We"perceive no reason to make an exception,
and appellees suggest none. Indeed, all of the reasons
for application of the principle in tle other contexts
are equally applicable here. "To be sure, administration
of the electoral process is a matter that the Constitution
largely entrusts to the States. But, in exercising their
powers of supervision, over elections and in settihg qualifications for voters, the States may not infringe upon
basic constitutional protections." Kusper v.- Pontikes,
ante, at 57 (footnote omitted)., At stake are appellants'
First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to ass6ciate with
others for the common advancement of political beliefs
and ideas. "The right to associate with the political party
of one's choice is an integral part of this basic constitutional freedom." Ibid.; Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S.
23, 30 (1968). At stake as well are appellants' interests
as party members in casting an effective ballot. See
Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 142-144 (1972).
Thus, burdening access to the ballot, rights of association in the political party of one's 6hoice, interests in
casting an effective vote and in running for office, not
because the Party urges others "to do something, now or
in the future -.. . [but]

.. merely to believe in some-

thing," Yates v. United States, supra, at 325, is to

.infringe interests certainly as substantial as those in
public employment, tax exemption, or the practice of
law. For "the right to exercise the franchise in a free
and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic
civil and political rights.. . . ." Reynolds y. Sims, 377
U. S. 533, 562 (1964). "Other rights, even the most
basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined."
Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 17 (1964).
Appellees argue: "It is fraudulent for a group seeling
by violent revolution to overthrow our democratic form
of government to disguise itself as a political party and
use the very forms of the democracy it seeks to subvert
in order to gain support and carry on its nefarious ends."
Brief for Appellees 7. Again, they argue "that the affidavit required under the statute refers to the official
actions of the party itself, thus reducing to a minimum
any possibility of 'innocent involvement' in activities
which might be considered advocacy." Id., at 10. As we
understand appellees, this is an argument that, at least
for purposes of determining whether to grant a place on
the ballot, afiy group that advocates violent overthrow
as abstract doctrine must be regarded as necessarily advocating unlawful action. We reject .that proposition.
Its acceptance would only return the law to the "thoroughly discredited" regime of Whitney v. California,
274 U. S. 357 (1927), unanimously overruled by the
Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S., at 447, 449.1

the constitutional -limitations require that criminal advocacy by the
Communist Party be proved by "some substantial direct or circumstantial evidence of a call to violence now or in the future which is
both sufficiently strong and sufficiently pervasive to lend color to the
otherwise ambiguous theoretical material regarding Communist Party
teaching and to justify the inferencmthat, such a call to violence *may

MR.JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR.JUSTICE REHNQUIST

join, concurring in the result.
I I concur in the result. In my view it was quite
unnecessary to reach the issue addressed by the Court.
It was established at trial that appellees had certified
the Democratic and Republican Parties despite the failure of party officials to submit the prescribed affidavits
under Ind. Ann. Stat. § 29-3812 (1969).1 In William7 v.
Rhodes, 393 U. S. .23, 31 (1968), this Court held -that
a discriminatory preference for established parties under
a State's electoral system can be justified only by a
"compelling state interest." In the present case, no colorable justification has been offered for placing on appellants burdens not imposed 'on the- two established
fairly be imputed to the Party as a whole, and not merely to some
narrow segment of it." See also Scales v. United States, 367 U. S.
203 (1961); Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957).
1
The complaint in this case ixpressly alleged that § '29-3812
subjected appellants to burdens not imposed on the Republican and
Democratic Parties, and proof at trial- was directed to that issue.
The Court now maintains that this issue cannot be "considered
because it was not expressly raised in the jurisdictional statement.
Ante, at 446-447., n. 6. Supreme Court Rule 15 (1) (c) provides, however, -thatthe jurisdictional statement "will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein" and that "questions set
forth in the jurisdictional statement or fairly comprised therein will
be considered by the court." The issue of discriminatory application
of the statute certainly falls within thd gravamen of appellants'
-jurisdictional statement and should therefore be considered. See, e.g.,
United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.-S. 365, 371372 n.
4 (1967), . Moreover, the appropriate exercise of judicial power
requires that important constitutional issues not be decided unnecessarily where narrower grounds exist for according relief. This
consideration applies even thougkhiuch grounds are not raised in the
jurisdictional submissions. Boynton v. Virginia 364 U. B. 454, 457
(1960). Cf. Barr v. Motteo, 355 U. S.171, 172 (1957).

parties. 2 It follows that the appellees' discriminatory
application of the Indiana statute denied appellants equal
protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.'

The Court's intimation that a prima facie case of constitutional
deprivation was not established because Board officials were "silent
as to the reasons behind the omission" of the established parties from
the affidavit requirement (ante, at 447 n. 6) misses the point. Nothing more need be shown than that the statute was in fact discriminatorily applied. It is the Board officials, not the appellants, who must
then come forth with reasons justifying the discriminatory application
of-the statute.
3 In view of this patently unconstitutional application of the
statute, there is no occasion to reach the broader issue addressed
by the Court today. Although I express no conclusion on that
issue, it should be noted that this is the first case touching upon the
type of oath which may be required of a candidate for the office
of President of the United States. The Indiana oath, of course,
is required of the party rather than its presidential candidate. But
it could be argued that Yates v. United States, 354 U S. 298 (1957),
and its progeny are not controlling here. Under Art. VI, cl. 3, all
state -and federal officers are bound by oath "to support this Constitution," and under Art. II, § 1, cl.8, the President must swear that
he will "faithfully execute the Office . . .and will to the best of
[his] Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the
United States." Art. II, § 3, also imposes on the Presideit the
affirmakive duty to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed."
Neither the effect of these explicit constitutional obligations nor the
responsibility of a chief executive official of government to enforce
the rule of law was a relevant issue in anv of the Yates line of
cases. Cf. Cole v. Richardson, 405 U. S. 676 (1972).
