MOORE v. ARIZONA
ON PETITION FOR 'WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF ARIZONA

No. 73-5002. Decided November 5, 1973
Where petitioner was tried for murder in Afizona almost three years

Arizona either extradite him from California, where he was serving
a prison term, or drop a detainer against him, the Arizona Supreme
Court, in affirming the denial of petitioner's pretrial habeas corpus
application, erred in ruling that a showing of prejudice to the defense at trial was essential to establish a federal speedy trial claim.
In addition to possible prejudice, a court must weigh the reasons
for delay in bringing an incarcerated defendant to trial, and should
also consider the possible impact pending charges might have on
defendant's prospects for parole and meaningful rehabilitation.

term, or drop a detainer against him, petitioner 'was
tried for murder in Arizona. Prior to trial, he filed ..

state habeas corpus application, alleging a deprivat.0i
of his Â§ixth and Fourteenth Amendment' right:.tc, a,
speedy trial. In affirming the denial of the petitiin, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that under this Court's
decisions in Dickey v. Florida,398 U. S. 30 (1970); and
Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972), a showing of
prejudice to the defense at trial was essential to establish
a federal speedy trial claim. The state court found no
such prejudice here because petitioner, was afforded a

preliminary hearing and allowed to'subpoena witnesses.'
109 Ariz. 111, 506 P. 2d 242 (1973).
The state court was in fundamental error in its
reading of Barker v. Wingo and in the standard applied
in judging petitioner's Speedy trial claim. Barker v.
Wingo expressly rejected the notion that an affirmative
demonstration of prejudice was necessary to prove a
denial of the constitutional right to a speedy trial:
"We regard none of the four factors identified
above [length of delay, reason for delay, defendant's
assertion of his- right, and prejudice to the defendant] as either a necessary or sufficient condition
to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy
trial. Rather, they are related factors and must be
considered together with such other circumstances
as may be relevant. In sum, these factors have
no talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in
a difficult and sensitive balancing process. But,
because we are dealing with a fundamental right of
the accused, this process must be carried out with
full recognition that the accused's interest in a speedy
trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution."
407 U. S., at 533 (footnote omitted).
In addition to possible prejudice, any court must thus
carefully weigh the reasons for the delay in bringing an
incarcerated defendant to trial. In the face of petitioner's repeated demands, did the State discharge its
"constitutional duty to make a diligent, good-faith effort
to bring him [to trial]"? Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374,
383 -(1969).
Moreover, prejudice to a defendant caused by delay
in bringing him to trial is not confined to the possible
'The court did not mention the unavailability of one of the two
key witnesses as the result of her deportation 18 months after the
charge had been filed against petitioner.

prejudice to his defense in those proceedings.' Inordinate
delay,
"wholly aside from possible prejudice to 'a defense
on the merits, may 'seriously interfere with the
defendant's liberty, whether he is free on bail or
not, and . . . may disrupt his employment, drain
his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in
him, his family and his friends.' United States v.
Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 320 (1971). .These factors
are more serious for some than for others, but they
are inevitably present in every case to some extent,
for every defendant will either be incarcerated
pending trial or on bail subject to substantial restrictions on his liberty." Barker v. Wingo, supra,
at 537 (WHITE, J., concurring). "
See also id., at 532-533 (majority opinion). Some of
these factors may carry quite different weigh-; where
a defendant is incarcerated after conviction in another
State, but no couri should overlook the possible impact pending charges might have on his prospects for
parole and meaningful rehabilitation. Strunk v. United
States, 412 U. S.434, 439 (1973).
The State of Arizona itself has conceded tha ' this is
a close case under Barkerv. Wingo and that it is arguable
whether *the three-year delay was excusable. Because
we agree and because "the right to a speedy trial is as
The examples of possible trial prejudice recited in Barker bear
directly on this case:
"If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is
obvious. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to
recall accurately events of the .distant past. Loss 6f memory,
however, is not -always reflected in the record. because what has
been forgotten can rarely be shown." Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S.
