ET AL.-

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED .STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

No. 72-953.

Argued October 17, 1973-Decided January 15, 1974

Respondents, 17 black and two white residents of Cairo, Illinois,
brought a civil rights class action against petitioners, a magistrate
and a circuit court jfidge, who allegedly engaged under'color of state
law, in a continuing pattern and practice of conduct consisting
of illegal bond-setting, sentencing, and jury-fee practices in criminal
cases, which assertedly deprived respondents and members of
their class of their rights undbrthe Constitution and 42 U. S. C.
§§ 1981-1983, 1985. The District Court dismissed the action for
want of jurisdiction to issue the -injunctive relief sought and on
the ground of judicial immunity. The Court of Appeals reversed,.
holding that issuance of injunctions against judicial officers was
not forbidden if their conduct was intentionally racially discriminatory against a cognizable class of persons. Absent sufficient remedy at law, it was held that if respondents proved their
allegatiobis, the District Court should fashion appropriate relief
to enjoin petitioners from depriving others of their constitutional
rights while carrying out their judicial duties in the future. Held:
1. The complaint fails to satisfy the threshold requirement of
Art. III of the Constitution that those who seek to invoke the
-power of federal courts must allege an actual case or controversy, where none of the named plaintiffs is identified as himself
having suffered any injury'in the manner specified, the claim
alleging injury is in only the most general terms, and there are
no allegations that any, relevant state criminal statute is unconstitutional on its face or as applied or that plaintiffs have
been or will be improperly charged with violating criminal law.
Pp. 493-499.
(a) If none of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent a
class meets the case-or-controversy" requirement, none may seek
relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class.

Pp. 494-495.

(b) That requirement is not satisfied by general assertions or
inferences that in the course of their activities respondents will
be prosecuted ,for violating valid cibinal laws. P. 497.
(c) Where it can only be speculated whether respondents will
be arrested for violating an 'ordinance or state statute, particularly, in the absence of allegations that unconstitutional criminal statutes are being employed to deter constitutionally protected
conduct, and respondents have not pointed to' any imminent
prosecutions contemplated against them so that they do not
claim any censtitutional right to engage in conduct proscribed
by therefore presumably permissible state laws, or that it is
otherwise their intention to so conduct themselves, the threat
of injury from the alleged course of conduct they attack is too
remote to satisfy the case-or-contiroversy requirement and permit
adjudication by a federal court. Pp. 497-498.
23 Even if the complaint were considered to present an existing
.case or controversy, no adequate basis for equitable relief has
been stated. Pp. 499-504.
(a) The injunctive relief sought by respondents would constitute a major continuing intrusion of the equitable power of
the federal courts into the daily conduct of state criminal proceedings, and would sharply conflict with recognized principles
of equitable restraint, Younger v. Harris,401 U. S. 37. Pp. 499502.
(b) Respondents also failed to establish the basic requisites
of the issuance of equitable relief-the likelihood' of substantial
and immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies.

to which respondents are allegedly subjected, and where there

The respondents are 19 named individuals who commenced this civil rights action, individually and on
behalf of a class.of citizens of the.city of Cairo, Illinois,
against the State's Attorney for Alexander County,
Illinois, his investigator, the Police Commissioner of
Cairo, and the petitioners here, Michael O'Shea and
Dorothy Spomer, Magistrate and Associate Judge of the
Alexander County Circuit Court, respectively, alleging
that they have intentionally engaged in, and are continuing to engage in, various patterns and practices of
6onduct in the administration of- the criminal justice'
system in Alexander County that deprive respondents of
rights secured by the First, Sixth, Eighth, Thirteenth,
and Fourteenth Amendments, and by 42 U. S. C.
§§ 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985. The complaint, as
amended, alleges that since the early 1960's, black
citizens of Cairo, together with a small number of white
persons on their behalf, have been actively, peaceably
and lawfully seeking equality of opportunity and treatment in employment, housing, education, participation

in governmental decisionmaking and in ordinary cqayto-day relations with white citizens and officials of Cairo,
anid have, as an -.important part of their protest, partici pated in, and encouraged others to participate in; an
ecbnomi" boycott of city merchants who respondents consider have engaged in racial discrimination. Allegedly,
there .haid resulted a great deal of tension and antagonism among the white citizens and officials of Cairo.
The individual respondents are 17 black and two white
residents of Cairo. The class, or'classes, which they purport to represent are alleged to include "all those who,
on account of their race or creed and because of their
exercise of First Amendment rights, have [been] in the
past and continue to be subjected to the unconstitutional
and selectively. discriminatory enforcement and-administration of criminal justice in Alexander County," as well
as financially poor persons "who, on account of their
poverty, are unable to afford bail, or are unable to afford
counsel and jury trials in city ordinance violation cases."
The complaint charges the State's Attorney,' his investigator, and the Police Commissioner with a pattern and
practice of intentional racial discrimination in the performance of their duties, by which the state criminal
laws and procedures are deliberately applied more
harshly to black residents of Cairo and inadequately
applied to white persons who 'victimize blacks, to deter
respondents from engaging in their lawful attempt "to
achieve equality. Specific supporting examples of such
conduct involving some of the individual respondents
are detailed in the complaint as to the State's Attorney
and his investigator.
Wit respect to -the petitioners, the county, magistrate and judge, a continuing pattern and practice of
conduct, under color of law, is alleged to have denied
and to continue -to deny the constitutional rights of
respondents and members of their class in-three respects:

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

414 U. S.

(1) petitioners set bond in criminal cases according to
an unofficial bond schedule without regard to the facts
of a case or .circumstances of an individual defendant in
violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;
(2) "on information and belief" they set sentences higher
and impose harsher conditions for respondents and members of their class than for white persons, and (3) they
require respondents and members of their class when
charged with violations of city ordinances which carry
fines and possible jail penalties if the fine cannot be paid,
to pay for a trial by jury in"violation of the Sixth,
Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Each of these
continuing practices is alleged -to have been carried out
intentionally to deprive -respondents and their class of
the protections of the county criminal justice system and
to deter them from engaging in their boycott and similar
activities. The complaint further alleges that there is
no adequate remedy at law and requests that the practices be enjoined., No damages were sought against the
petitioners in this case, nor were any specific instances
involving the individually named respondents set forth
in the claim against these judicial officers.
The District Court dismissed the case for want of
jurisdiction to issue, the injunctive relief prayed for and
on the ground that petitioners were immune from suit
with respect tb acts done in. the course of their judicial
duties. The ,Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554 (1967), on which the
District -Court relied, did not forbid the issuance of
injunctions against judicial officers if it is alleged and
proved that they have knowingly engagedin conduct
intended - to discriminate against a cognizable class of
persons on the basis of race. Absent ..sufficient remedy
at law, the Court of Appeals ruled. that in the event
respondents proved their allegations, the District Court
should, proceed to fashion appropriate injunctive relief

judicial duties in the future.' We granted certiorari..

We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
The complaint failed to satisfy the threshold requirement
imposed by Art. III of the -Constitution that those who
seek to invoke the power of federal courts must allege
an actual case or controversy. Flast v. Cohen, 392 U. S.
83, 94-101 (1968);, Jenkins v. McKeithen,-395 U. S. 411,
421-425 (1969) (opinion of AaSHALL, J.). Plaintiffs
in the federal courts "must allege sorge threatened or
actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action
before a federal .court may assume jurisdiction." Linda
R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U. S. 614, 617 (1973).2 There
'While the Court of Appeals did not attempt to specify exactly
what type of injunctive relief might be justified, it at least suggested
that it might include a requirement of "periodic reports of various
types of aggregate data on. actions on bail and .sentencing." 468
F. 2d, at 415. The dissenting judge urged that a federal district
coint has no power to supervise and regulate by mandatory injunction the discretion which state court judges may exercise within
the limits of the powers vested in them by law, and that any relief
contemplated by the majority holding which might be applicable to
the pattern and: practice alleged, if proven, would subject the peti-.
tioners to the continuing supervision of the .Di]strict Court, the
necessity of defending their motivations in each instance when the
fixing of bail or sentence was challenged by a Negro defendant as
inconsistent with the equitable relief granted, and the possibility
of -acontempt citation for failure to comply with the relief awarded.

2We have previously noted that "Congress may enakt statutes
creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing, even
though no injury would exist without the statute. See, e. g.,
Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. -Co.,409 U. S. 205, 212 (1972)
(Wmm, J., concurring); Hardin v. Kentulcky Utilities Co., 390
U. S. 1, 6 (1968)." Linda R. S. v. Richard D., 410 U. S: 614, 617

must be a "personal stake in the outcome" such as to
'assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the
presentation of issues upon which the court so largely
depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions." Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962). Nor
is the principle different where statutory issues are
raised. Cf. United States v. SCRAP, 412 U. S. 669, 687
(1973).

Abstract injury is not enough.

It

must be

alleged that the plaintiff "has sustained or is immcdiately
in danger of sustaining some direct injury" as the result

of the challenged statute or official conduct. Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 488 (1923). The injury
or threat of injury must be both "real and immediate,"
Golden v. Zwickler,
not "conjectural" or "hypothetical."

394 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1969); Maryland Casualty Co. v.
Pacific Coal & Oil Co., 312 U. S. 270, 273 (1941);
United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S.75, 89-91
Moreover, if none of the named plaintiffs
(1947).
purporting to represent a class establishes the requisite
of a case or controversy with the defendants, none may
seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of

the class.3 Bailey v. Patterson, 369 U. S. 31, 32-33
n. 3 (1973). But such statutes do not purport to bestow the right to
sue in the-absence of any indication that invasion of the statutory
right has occurred or is likely to occur. Title 42 U. S. C. § 1983, in
particular, provides for liability to the "party injured" in an action at
law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. Perforce, the constitutional requirement of an actual case or controversy
remains. Respondents still must show actual or threatened injury
of some kind to establish standing in. the constitutional sense.
3
There was no class determination in this case as the complaint
was dismissed on grounds which did not require that determination
to be made. Petitioners assert that the lack of standing of the
named respondents to raise the class claim is buttressed by the
incongruous nature of the class respondents seek to represent. The
class is vdriously and incompatibly defined in the complaint as those
residents of Cairo, both Negro and white, who have boycotted

Opinion of the Court

(1962); Indiana Employment Division v. Burney, 409
U. S. 540 (1973). See 3B J. Moore, Federal Practice,
123.10-1, n. 8 (2d ed. 1971).
In the complaint that began this action, the sole
allegations of injury are that petitioners "have engaged
in and continue to engage in, a pattern and practice of
conduct . . . all of which has deprived and continues
to deprive plaintiffs and members of their class of their"
constitutional rights and, again, that petitioners "have
denied and continue to deny to plaintiffs and members
of their class their constitutional rights" by illegal bondsetting, sentencing, and jury-fee practices. None of the
named plaintiffs is identified as himself having suffered
any injury in the manner specified. In sharp contrast to
the claim for relief -against the State's Attorney where
specific instances of misconduct with respect to particular
individuals are alleged, the claim against petiti6ners
alleges injury in only the mbst general terms. At oral
argument, respondents' counsel stated that some of- the
named plaintiffs-respondents, who could be identified by
name if necessary, had actually been defendants in proceedings before petitioners and had suffered from the
alleged unconstitutional practices.4 Past exposure to
illegal conduct does not in itself show a prespnt case or
controversy regarding injunctive relief, however, if
certain businesses in that city and engaged in similar activities for
the purpose of combatting racial discrimination, as a class of all
Negro citizens suffering racial discrimination in the application of the
criminal justice system in Alexander- County (though two white
persons are named respondents), and as all poor persons unable to
afford bail, counsel, or jury trials in city ordinance 'cases. The
absence of specific claims of injury.as a result of any of the wrongful
-practices charged, in light of the ambiguous and contradictory
class definition proffered, bolsters our conclusion that these respondents cannot- invoke federal jurisdiction to hear the claims they
present in support of their request for injunctive relief.

unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse
effects. Neither the complaint nor respondents' counsel
suggested that any of the named plaintiffs at the time
the complaint was filed were themselves serving an allegedly illegal sentence or were on trial or awaiting'trial
before petitioners. Indeed, if any of the respondents were
then serving an assertedly unlawful sentence, the complaint would iiappropriately be seeking relief from or
modification of current, existing custody. See Preiserv.
Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973). Furthermore, if any
were then on trial or awaiting trial in state proceedings,
the complaint would be seeking injunctive relief that a
federal court should not provide. Younger v. Harris,401
U. S. 37 (1971); see also Part II, infra. We thus 'do
not strain to read inappropriate meaning into the conclusory allegations of this complaint.
Of' course, past wrongs are evidence bearing on
whether there is a real and immediate threat of repeated
injury. But here the prospect of future injury rests on
the likelihood that respondents will again be arrested
for and charged with violations of the criminal law and
will again be subjected to bond proceedings, trial, or
sentencing before petitioners. Important to this assessment is the absence of allegations that any relevant
criminal statute of the State of Illinois is unconstitutional on its face or as.applied or that respondents have
been or will be improperly charged 'with violating
criminal law. If the statutes that might possibly be
enforced against respondents are valid laws, and if
charges under these statutes are not improvidently made
or pressed, the question becomes whether any perceived
threat to respondents is sufficiently real and immediate
to show an existing controversy simply because they
anticipate violating lawful criminal statutes and being
tried for their offenses, in which event they may appear
before petitioners and, if they do, will be affected by the

O'SHEA v. LITTLETON
488

Opinion of the -Court

allegedly illegal conduct charged. Apparently, the proposition is that if -respondents proceed- to violate an
unchallenged law and if they are charged, held to answer,
and tried in any proceedings before petitioners, they will
be subjected to the discriminatory. practices 'that petitioners are alleged to have followed. But it seems to
us that attempting to anticipate whether and when these
respondents will'be 'charged with crime and will be made
to appear before either petitioner takes us into the area
of speculation- and conjecture. See Younger v. Harrfs,
supra, at 41-42. The nature of respondents' activities is not described- in detail, and no specific threats
are alleged to have been made against them. Accepting
that they are deeply involved in a program to eliminate
racial discrimination in Cairo and that tensions are high,
we are nonetheless unable to. conclude that the case-orcontroversy requirement is satisfied by general assertions
or. inferences that in the course of their activities respondents will be prosecuted for violating valid criminal
laws. We assume" that respondents will conduct their
activities within the law and so avoid prosecution and
convi~tion as well as exposure to the challenged course of
conduct said to be followed by petitioners.
As in Golden v. Zwickler, we doubt that there is" 'sufficienit immediacy and reality"' to respondents' allegations
of future injury to warrant invocation of the jurisdiction
of the District Court. There, "it was wholly conjectural
that another occasion might arise when Zwickler might
be prosecuted for distributing the handbills referred to
in the complaint." 394,U. S., at 109. Here -wecan only
speculate whether respondents will be arrested, either
again or for the first time, for violating a municipal ordinance or a state statute, particularly in the absence- of
any allegations that unconstitutional criminal statutes
are being employed to deter constitutionally protected
conduct. Cf. Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82, 101-102

*498

OCTOBER TERM, 1973
Opinion of the Court

(1971) (opinion of BRENNAN, J.).

414 U. S.

Even though Zwickler

attacked a specific statute under which he had previously
been prosecuted, the threat of a new prosecution was not
suffibiently imminent to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the federal courts. Similarly, respondents here
have not pointed to any imminent prosecutions contemplated against any of their number and they naturally
do not suggest that any one of them expects to violate
valid criminal laws. Yet their vulnerability to the
alleged threatened injury from which relief is sought is
necessarily contingent upon the bringing of prosecutions
against one or more of them. Under these circumstances,
where respondents do not claim any constitutional right"
to engage in conduct proscribed by therefore presumably
permissible state laws, or indicate that it is otherwise
their intention to so conduct themselves, the threat of
injury from the alleged course of conduct they attack is
simply too remote to satisfy the case-or-controversy requirement and permit adjudication by a federal court.
In Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. .77, 81 (1971), the Court
ordered a complaint dismissed for insufficiency of its
allegations where there was no basis for inferring "that
any one or more of the citizens who brought this suit is
in any jeopardy of suffering irreparable injury if the
State is left free to prosecute under the intimidation
statute in the normal' manner." The Court expressed
the view that "the normal course of state criminal prosecutions cannot be disrupted or blocked on the basis of
charges which in the last analysis amount to nothing
more than speculation about the future." Ibid. A
similar element of uncertainty about whether the alleged
injury will be likely to occur is present in this case, and
a similar reluctance to interfere with the normal operation of state -administration of its criminal laws in the
manner sought by respondents strengthens the conclusion

O'SHEA v. LITTLETON
488

499

Opinion of the Court

that the allegations in this complaint are too insubstantial to warrant federal adjudication of the merits of
respondents' claim.
II
The foregoing considerations obviously shade ir.to
those determining whether the complaint states a sound
basis for equitable relief; and even if we were inclined
to consider the complaint as presenting an existing case
or controversy, we would firmly disagree with -the Court
of Appeals that an adequate basis for equitable relief
against petitioners had been stated. The Court has
recently reaffirmed the "basic doctrine of equity jurispruidence that courts of equity should not act, and particularly should not act to restrain a criminal prosecution, when the moving party has an adequate remedy at
law and will not suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief." Younger v. Harris, 401 T. S. 37, 43-44
(1971). Additionally, recognition of the need for a proper
balance in the concurrent operation of federal and state
courts counsels restraint against the issuance of injunctions against state officers engaged in the administration
of the State's criminal laws in the absence of a showing
of irreparable injury which is "'both great and immediate."' Id., at 46. Se6, e.g., Fenner v. Boykin, 271
U. S. 240 (1926); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319
U. S. 157 (1943), In holding that 42 U. S. C. § 1983
is an Act of Congress that falls within the "expressly
authorized" exception td the absolute bar against federal
injunctions directed at state court proceedings. provided
by 28 U. S. C. § 2283, the Court expressly observed that
it did not intend to "question or qualify in any way the
principles of equity, comity, and federalism that must
restrain a federal court when asked .o enjoin a state
c'ourt proceeding." Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225,
243 (1972). Those principles preclude equitable intervention in the circumstances present here.

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

Opinion of the Cotrt

414 U. S.

Respondents do not seek to strike down a single state
statute, either on its face or as applied; nor do they seek
to enjoin any criminal prosecutions that might be brought
under a challenged criminal law. In fact, respondents
apparently contemplate that prosecutions will be brought
under seemingly valid state laws. What they seek is an
injunction aimed at controlling or preventing the occurrence of specific events that might take place in the
course of future state criminal trials. The order the
Court of Appeals thought should be available if respond.'ents proved their allegations would be operative only
where permissible state prosecutions are pending against
one or more of the beneficiaries of the injunction.
Apparently the order would contemplate interruption .of
state proceedings to adjudicate assertions of noncompliance by petitioners. This seems to us nothing less than
an ongoing federal audit of state criminal proceedings
which would indirectly accomplish the kind of interference that Younger viHarris,supra, and related cases
.sought to prevent.
A federal court should not intervene to establislt the
basis foi future intervention that would be so intrusive
and unworkable. In concluding that injunctive relief
would be available in this case because it would not interfere with prosecutions to be commenced under challenged statutes, the Court of Appeals misconceived the
underlying basis for withholding federal equitable relief
when the normal course of criminal proceedings in. the
state courts would otherwise be disrupted. The objection is to unwarranted anticipatory interference in the
state criminal process by means of continuous or piecemeal interruptions of the state proceedings by litigation
in the federal courts;--the object-is to sustain "[t]he
special. delicacy of the adjustment to be preserved
between federal equitable power and State administration of its own law." Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117,

(1963).; Wilsbn v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 (1961);
Pugach. v. Doflinger, 365 U. S., 458 (1961); cf. Rea v.
United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956). An injunction of
the type contemplated by respondents and the Court of
Appeals would disrupt the normal course of proceedings
in the state courts via resort to the federal suit for
determination of the claim ab initio, just as would, the
request for injunctive relief from an ongoing state prosecution against the federal plaintiff which was found to be
unwarranted in Younger. Moreover, it would require
for its enforcement the continuous supervision by the
federal court over the conduct of the petitioners in the
course of future criminal trial proceedings involving any
of the members of the respondents' broadly defined class.6
The Court of Appeals disclaimed any intention of requiring the District Court to sit in constant day-to-day
supervision of these judicial officers,
but the. "periodic
reporting" system it thought might be warranted 7 would
constitute a form of monitoring of the operation of state
court functions that is antipathetic to established principles of comity. Cf. Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U. S.
808 (1966).. Moreover, because an injunction against
acts which might occur-in-the course of future criminal
proceedings would necessarily impose continuing obligations of compliance, the question arises of how compliance
might be enforced if the beneficiaries of the injunction
were to charge that it had been disobeyed. Presumably,
any member of respondents' class who appeared as an

accused before petitioners could allege and have adjudicated a claim that petitioiiers were in contempt of the
federal court's injunction order, with review of adverse
decisions in the Court of Appeals and, perhaps, in this
Court. Apart from the inherent difficulties in defining
the proper standards against which such claims might be
measured, and the significant problems of proving noncompliance in individual cases, such a major continuing
intrusion of the equitable power of the federal courts into
-the daily conduct of state criminal proceedings is in
sharp conflict with the principles of equitable restraint
which this Court has recognized in the decisions previously noted.
Respondents have failed, moreover, to establish the
basic requisites of the issuance of equitable relief in these
circumstances-the likelihood of substantial and-immediate irreparable injury, and the inadequacy of remedies
at law. We have already canvassed the necessarily conjectural nature of the threatened injury to* which
respondents are allegedly subjected: And if any of the
respondents are ever prosecuted and face trial, or if they
are illegally sentenced, there are available state and
federal procedures which could provide relief from the
wrongful conduct alleged. Open to a victim of the discriminatory practices asserted under state law are the

414 U. S.

Considering the availability of other avenues of relief
open to respondents for the serious conduct they assert,
and the abrasive and unmanageable intercession which
the injunctive relief they seek would represent, we conclude that, apart from the absence of an existing case
or controversy presented by respondents for adjudication,
the Court of Appeals erred in deciding that the District
Court should entertain respondents' claim.
Reversed.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in part.
I join the judgment of* the Court and Part I of
the Court's opinion which holds that the complaint
"failed to satisfy the threshold requirement imposed by
Art. III of the Constitution that those who seek to
invoke the power of federal courts must allege an actual
case or controversy." Ante, at 493.
When we arrive at that conclusion, it follows, it seems
to -me, that we are precluded from considering any other
issue presented for review. Thus, the Court's additional
discussion of the question whether a case for equitable
relief was stated amounts to an advisory opinion
that we are powerless to render. Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall.

Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated the applicable principle
in speaking for the Court in InternationalLongshoremen's
& Warehousemen's Union v. Boyd, 347 U. S. 222, 223

(1954):
"On this appeal, appellee contends that the District Court should not have reached the statutory
and constitutional questions-that it should have

dismissed the suit for want of a 'case or controversy,'
for lack of standing on the union's part to bring this
action .....
Since the first objection is conclusive,
there is an end of the matter."
I would adhere to that principle. Either there is no case
or controversy and that is the end of the matter, or there
is a case or controversy and the Court may go on to a
deQision on the merits. In my view, the Court inay not
have it both ways.

The respondents in this case are black and indigent
citizens of Cairo, Illinois. Suing in federal court, they
alleged that since tie early 1960's.black citizens of Cairo
have been actively seeking equal opportunity and treatment in employment, housing, education, and ordinary
day-to-day relations with the white citizens and officias
of Cairo. In this quest, blacks have engaged in a boycott
of local merchants deemed to have engaged in racial
discrimination.
Alleging that this quest for equality has generated substantial antagonism, from white governmental officials, respondents brought a class action under 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981,
1982, 1983, and 1985, seeking to represent citizens of Caho
who have been subjected in-the past, and continue to be
subjected, to the allegedly discriminatory and unconstitittional administration of criminal justice in Alexander
County, Illinois, which includes Cairo. Among their
other claims, respondents alleged that petitioners MichaEl
O'Shea and Dorothy Spomer, both now judges in Alex,
ander County,' engage in acts which deprive them and

suit was instituted, became an Associate Judge in the county on

members of their class of their constitutional rights.
These judges allegedly set bond in criminal cases without
regard to the facts of individual cases and as punishment,
and not merely to assure the appearance of defendants at
trial; impose higher sentences and harsher conditions of
sentencing on black than on white citizens; and require
respondents and members of their class, when charged
with violations of city ordinances which carry fines and
possible jail penalties, to pay for a trial by jury if the
fine cannot be paid.

I

An injunction was sought against this conduct. The
District Court referred obliquely to want of jurisdiction,
but, focusing on the fact that the complaint sought review of matters of judicial discretion, concluded that
the action should be dismissed because judges and magistrates are immune from liability for acts done in performance of their duties. In reversing and r~manding
the case to the District Court, the Court of Appeals
held that the action was not barred by the doctrine of
judicial immunity. The Court of Appeals also held that
the complaint contained sufficiently specific factual averments to satisfy Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8 (a). 468 F. 2d
389.
This Court now decides for the first time in the course
of this litigation that the complaint is deficient because
it does not state a "case or controversy" within the
meaning Df Art. III.
The fact that no party has raised that issue in this
closely contested case is no barrier, of course, to our
consideration of it. But the reasoning and result reached
by the Court are to say the least a tour de force and
quite inconsistent with the allegations in the complaint,
which are within constitutional.requirements.

O'SHIEA v. LITTLETON
488

DOULAS,

J., dissenti g

We know from the record and oral argument that
Cairo, Illinois, is boiling with racial confficts. This class
action brought under 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981, 1982, 1983,
and 1985 is to remedy vast invasions of civil rights.
The Court, however, says that it is not a "case or controversy" because none of the named plaintiffs has alleged
infringement of his rights and the fact that other members of the class may have been injured is not enough.
As to the latter, Bailey v. Patterson,369 U. S. 31, 32-33,
is cited in support. But in Bailey the named persons
were given standing to sue, the statement that "[they
cannot represent a class of whom they are not a part,"
id., at 32-33, being dictum and its only authority being
McCabe v. Atchison, .T. & S. F. R. Co., 235 U. S.
151, 162-163, which was not a class action. Nor
was. the question on which the case is made to turn resolved in Indiana Employment Division v.. Burney, 409
U. S. 540. For we only held that where the named
plaintiff had received relief and nothing appeared as
to the relief, if. any, granted to members of the class,
the possible question of mootness should be resolved by
the District Court. Even so, there were dissents. The
upshot is that one crucial issue on which the Court makes
this case turn has not been decided by the Court and
was never argued here. At the very least we shoul6. have
a full-dress argument on that point.
•But I do not press the point, for the amended complaint is sufficiently specific to warrant a trial.
As respects O'Shea, the Magistrate, and Spomer, the
Circuit Judge, 'the charges concerning named plaintiffs
are as follows:
(1) that excessive bonds have been -re.quired'in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because
petitioners follow an unofficial bond schedule without
regard to the facts of individial cases;

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

414 U. S.

(2) on information and belief, that petitioners set
higher sentences and impose harsher conditions for
respondents and, members of their class than for white
persons;
(3) that, where the named plaintiffs have been fined
and at times sentenced to jail and cannot pay the fines,
these judges have required them to pay for a triai by

jury.
Moreover, the amended complaint alleges that O'Shea
and Spomer "continue to engage in a pattern and practice" which "has deprived and continues to deprive" the
named plaintiffs and members of their class of their constitutional rights. Moreover,. it is alleged that since
early in the 1960's the blacks of Cairo and some whites
have been actively and peaceably seeking to end discrimination in Cairo and that those activities have
generated and continue to generate tension and antagonism in Cairo.
It is also alleged that the police commissioner in Cairo
"has denied and continues to deny to plaintiffs and members of their class their constitutional rights in the
following ways:
"(a) Defendant has made or caused to be made
or cooperated in the making of arrests and the filing
of charges against 151aintiffs and members of their
class where such charges are not warranted and are
merely for the purpose of harassment and to "discourage and prevent plaintiffs and their class from
exercising their constitutional rights.
"(b) Defendant has made or caused to be made
or cooperated in the making of arrests and the filing
of charges against plaintiffs and members of their
class where there may be some colorable basis to
the arrest or charge, but the crime defined in the
charge is much harsher than is warranted by the

O'SHFA v. LITTLETON "
488

DouGLAs, J., dissenting

facts and is far more severe than like charges would
be against a white person."
These allegations suplort the likelihood that the
named plaintiffs as well as members of their class will
be arrested in the future and therefore will be brought
before O'Shea and* Spomer and .be subjected to the
alleged discriminatory' practices in the administration of
justice.
These allegations of past and continuing wrongdoings
clearly .state a case or controversy in the Art. III sense.
They are as specific as those alleged in Jenkins v.
McKeithen, 395 U. S. 411, and in Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S.
179, where we held that cases or controversies were
presented.
Specificity of proof may not be forthcoming; but
specificity of charges is clear.
What has been alleged here is not only wrongs "dQne
to named plaintifts, but'a recurring pattern of wtohgs
which establishes, if proved, that the legal regime under
control of the whites in Cairo, Illinois, is used over 'and
over again to keep the blacks from exercising First
Anendment rights, to discriminate against them, to keep
from the blacks" the protection of the law in their lawful
activities, to weight the scales of justice repeatedly on
the side of white prejudices and against black protests,
fears, and suffering. This is a more pervasive scheme
for suppression of blacks'and their civil'rights than I
I-ave, ever seen. It may not survive, a trial. But if
this case does not present a "cae or controversy" involving the named plaintiffs, then that concept has been
so .watered down as to be no longer recognizable. This
will please the white superstructure, but it does violence
to the conception of evenhanded justice envisioned by
the Constitution.
Suits under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 are exceptions to the
absolute bar against federal injunctions directed at state

court proceedings provided in 28 U. S. C. § 2283.2 See
Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225. It will be much
more appropriate to pass on the nature of any equitable relief to be granted after the case has been
tried. It may be that when the case is ended, no
injunction against any state proceeding will be asked
for or will seem appropriate. Or the injunctive relief
in final analysis may come down to very narrow
and discrete orders prohibiting precise practices. The
Court labels this an "ongoing federal audit of state
criminal proceedings." That of course is a regime that we
do not foster. But the Federal Constitution is supreme
and if the power of the white power-structure in Cairo,
Illinois, is so great as to disregard it, extraordinary relief
is demanded. I would cross the bridge of remedies only
when the precise contours of thc problem have been
established after a trial.
To repeat, in the instant case, there are allegations that
state lower-court judges are willfully discriminating
in their sentencing determinations and are imposing
excessive bail.
The effects of such results may wellpersist quite aside from the disposition of the underlying substantive charges at trial or on appeal, and
may well be functionally unreviewable. The Court
of Appeals observed, 468 F. 2d, at 408, that the individual
defendant in a criminal case will find it difficult, if not
impossible, to obtain review of a sentence within statutory limits unless it is manifestly harsh or unjustified,
citing the Illinois rule that "imposition of sentence is
a matter of judicial discretion, and in the absence of a
manifest abuse of that discretion it will not be altered
"Title 28 U. S. C. § 2283 provides that:
'"Acourt of the United States may not grant an injunction to stay
proceedings in a State court except as expressly authorized by Act
of Congress, or where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments."

by a reviewing court." People v. Bonner, 37 Ill. 2d 553,
563, 229 N. E. 2d 527, 533 (1967), cert. denied, 392- U. S.
910 (1968).
Furthermore, the respondents do not primarily allege
individual instances of excessively harsh treatment, on
an absolute scale, of black and indigent defendants, but
rather a pattern of discriminatory treatment, especially in
favor of prosperous white defendants. Such allegations
would amount to denials of equal protection even if blacks
and poor whites were not subject to sentences which were
so excessive that they constituted manifest abuses-of dis-cretion, as long as wealthy whites were at the same
time receiving relatively lenient sentences from -the
game judges. A single instance of sentencing by itself
might-not strike the conscience of a reviewing court, but
when coupled with a pattern of discriminatory treatment
could well justify the equitable intervention of a federal
court. A class suit where evidence could be devloled
showing a pattern of discriminatory bail and sentencing
decisions by the petitioners would be the one appropriate
vehicle in which these claims could be developed.
Whether respondents could come forward with such
evidence, and whether the Federal District Court in the
exercise of its equitable discretion could, frame suitable
relief are, of course, questions which can be answered only
after a trial on the merits. The resolution of those issues
would then be properly reviewable. But the principles
of abstention and comity should not bar this suit ab
initio.
II
Because I believe that the complaint is sufficient to
state an actual "case or controversy," I would reAch the
further question, on the merits, .whether equitable relief
may be warranted in the circumstances of this case. I
agree, nonetheless, with my Brother BLACKmuw that the

APPENDIX TO OPINION OF DOUGLAS, J.,

There are seven statutes in addition to 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983 which the Court has recognized constitute "express
exceptions" to the policy of nonintervention in state
proceedings enunciated by the anti-injunction statute:
(1) The Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 1 et seq., specifically recognized by Congress as an exception to 28 U. S. C.
§ 2283. See Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225, 233.
(2) The Interpleader Act of 1936, 28 U. S. C. § 2361, allowing federal courts to restrain prosebution of state court
suits involving property involved 'in
federal interpleader
actions. See Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S.66,
74. (3) The 1851 Act limiting the liability of shipowners
by providing for the cessation of proceedings against them
when they have made a deposit equal to the value cf
their ships with a federal court, 46 U. S. C. § 185. See
Providence & N. Y. S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U. S.
578, 599-600. (4) The Frazier-Lemke Farm Mortgage
Act, 11 U. S. C. § 203 (s)(2) (1958 ed.). See Kalb v.
Feuerstein,308 U. S.433. (5) The Federal Habeas Corpus
Act, 28'U. S. C. § 2251, permitting a stay of state court
proceedings when a federal habeas action is pending. See
Ex Parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 248-249. (6) Section
205 (a) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56
Stat. 33. See Porter v. Dicken, 328 U. S. 252, 255.
(7) Legislation providing for. the removal of litigation to
federal courts and the simultaneous cessation of state
court proceedings, 28 U. S. C. § 1446 (e). See French
v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250.

This. Court has also recognized the power of a federal
court to stay proceedings in a state court to prevent
relitigation of an issue already decided in a federal procedding. See Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255
U. S. 356; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93, 112.

Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226; Toucey
v. New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U. S.418, 135-136. And
we have found it proper for a federal court to dirctly
enjoin state proceedings when the injunction was sought
by either the United States, Leiter Minerals, Inc. v.

asserting superior federal interests, see NLRB v. NashFinch Co., 404 U. S. 138.
