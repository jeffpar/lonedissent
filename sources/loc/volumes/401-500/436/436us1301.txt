OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS ON JUNE 7, 1978
LITTLE v. CIUROS, COMMISSIONER OF CORRECTION

OF NEW YORK CITY,

ET AL.

ON REAPPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-1007. Decided June 7, 1978
Reapplication for stay denied.

United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407,

distinguished.
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL,

Circuit Justice.

The application for a stay in this case was denied by the
Court on June 5, 1978. Ante, p. 943.
This new application is based on the following allegation:
"Following this Court's denial on June 5, 1978, of Petitioner's original application for the aforesaid stay, counsel
for Petitioner has been informed that the Office of the
Attorney General of the State of North Carolina has
stated publicly that it intends to prosecute Petitioner for
the crime of escape upon her return to said jurisdiction."
In support of this new application it is stated:
"Under the principle of specialty, a demanding country
may not try an individual who has been extradicted [sic]
for any offense other than that for which extradition was
granted, unless the alleged offense was committed after
extradition. United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407
(1886)."
It just so happens that United States v. Rauscher was
controlled by a treaty between the United States and Great
Britain. Needless to say, there is no treaty involved here.
The application is, therefore, without legal support and is
Denied.
