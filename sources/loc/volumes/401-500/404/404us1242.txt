Opinion in Chambers

404 U. S.

PRYOR v. UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF MANDATE OR, IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, FOR CONTINUATION OF BAIL
PENDING CERTIORARI
No. A-403.

Decided October 29, 1971

Since three members of the Court have manifested their willingness
in the past to consider certain aspects of constitutional questions
arising from conscription for a presidential war, bail shall be continued in this case, which involves one such issue, pending disposition of applicant's petition for certiorari.
See: 448 F. 2d 1273.

Circuit Justice.
Applicant is a Jehovah's Witness who was convicted
for failing to report for civilian work in lieu of induction.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed his
conviction, rejecting, inter alia, applicant's argument that
forced alternate service in the absence of a congressional
declaration of war violated his rights under the First
Amendment. He seeks a stay of the mandate of the
Court of Appeals or, in the alternative, a continuation
of bail pending disposition of his petition for certiorari.
I have expressed at length my view that the constitutional questions raised by conscription for a presidential
war are justiciable, substantial, and should be reviewed by
this Court. Hart v. United States, cert. denied, 391 U. S.
956 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting); Holmes v. United States,
cert. denied, 391 U. S. 936 (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, this term, has also dissented from
the denial of certiorari in cases raising this issue. See,
e. g., Thompson v. United States, cert. denied, ante,
p. 916; Gidmark v. United States, cert. denied, ante,
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

p. 868. MR. JUSTICE STEWART has in the past indicated
a willingness to consider aspects of the problem.

Opinion in Chambers

v. United States, supra (Memorandum of STEWART, J.).

There are now two vacant seats on the Court. Moreover, three out of seven are enough to grant a petition
for certiorari.
In light of the foregoing, I no longer feel precluded,
Drifka v. Brainard,89 S. Ct. 434, 21 L. Ed. 2d 427, from
granting such relief as is requested here. Bail will therefore be continued in the same amount and under. the same
conditions as presently in effect, pending disposition of
the petition for certiorari.
It is so ordered.
