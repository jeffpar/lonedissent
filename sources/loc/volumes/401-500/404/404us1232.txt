Opinion in Chambers

HARRIS v. UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR BAIL PENDING APPEAL

No. A-145.

Decided August 31, 1971

In the circumstances of this case, the application for bail pending
appeal from a narcotics conviction should not be denied since
applicant's appellate contentions concerning the nature and quantum of proof are not frivolous and there is no substantial evidence
that he is a flight risk.

MR.

JUSTICE

DOUGLAS, Circuit Justice.

This is an application for bail pending appeal to the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals have previously denied similar applications, and their action is entitled to
great deference. Reynolds v. United States, 80 S. Ct. 30,
4 L. Ed. 2d 46 (1959). Nevertheless, "where the reasons
for the action below clearly appear, a Circuit Justice has
a non-delegable responsibility to make an independent
determination of the merits of the application." Id., at
32, 4 L. Ed. 2d, at 48. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 46 (a) (2);
18 U. S. C. §§ 3146, 3148. Accord, Sellers v. United
States, 89 S.Ct. 36, 21 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1968). While there
is no automatic right to bail after convictions, Bowman
v. United States, 85 S.Ct. 232, 13 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1964),
"[t]he Command of the Eighth Amendment that 'Excessive bail shall not be required .

.

.' at the very least

obligates judges passing upon the right to bail to deny
such relief only for the strongest of reasons." Sellers,
supra, at 38, 21 L. Ed. 2d, at 66. The Bail Reform Act
of 1966, 18 U. S. C. §§ 3146, 3148, further limits the discretion of a court or judge to deny bail, as it provides that
a person shall be entitled to bail pending appeal, if that
appeal is not frivolous or taken for delay, or "unless the
court or judge has reason to believe that no one or more

conditions of release will reasonably assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or
to the community." § 3148.
Applying these principles, my examination of the
papers submitted by applicant and by the Solicitor General in opposition persuade me that the Government has
not met its burden of showing that bail should be denied.
The primary ground upon which the Solicitor General
opposes bail is that "[t]here are no substantial questions
raised" by the appeal. It is true that the questions
raised relate primarily to evidentiary matters. It is
settled, however, that these are within the purview of
review of an application of this kind, and that they
may raise nonfrivolous-indeed, even "substantial"questions. See, e. g., Wolcher v. United States, 76 S.Ct.

254, 100 L. Ed. 1521 (1955).
Applicant principally argues that there was no evidence in the record from which an inference is permissible that he knew that a truck guided by him and a codefendant, in a separate vehicle, from one location in
Los Angeles to another location in that city contained
unlawfully imported narcotics. It is beyond question,
of course, that a conviction based on a record lacking
any relevant evidence as to a crucial element of the
offense charged would violatq due process. See Adderley
v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39, 44 (1966). See also Johnson
v. Florida, 391 U. S. 596 (1968); Thompson v. Louis-

ville, 362 U. S. 199 (1960).
The quantum and
nature of proof constitutionally required to support an
inference of knowledge in narcotics offenses is not always
an easy question. Cf. Turner v. United States, 396 U. S.
398 (1970); Leary v. United States, 395 U. S.6 (1969).
Applicant cites a case from the Ninth Circuit as.a
factually similar example in which a conviction for a
narcotics offense was reversed for lack of proof of knowledge that another possessed the contraband. While I

express no opinion on the merits of the analogy, Circuit Justices have granted bail pending appeal based in
part on similar claims of failure of proof. See, e. g.,
Brussel v. United States, 396 U. S. 1229 (1969).
Applicant also challenges the hearsay testimony of an
informer as to a Tijuana phone number given to him by
a reputed Mexican narcotics trafficker. Other evidence
demonstrated that applicant's codefendant called this
number several times prior to the importation of the
contraband in July 1969. The implication, presumably,
is that the prior calls were made to arrange the shipment. The hearsay declaration, however, was made over
a year after the codefendant's phone calls occurred, and
the common scheme sought to be proven had been terminated. Under these circumstances, the admissibility
of this declaration as a hearsay exception is not free
from doubt. Cf. Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211
(1946).
Assuming this testimony is otherwise admissible, applicant argues it is not the "best evidence" of the registration of the phone number. While it is true that
Mexican phone company records were beyond the subpoena power of the court, and that courts have held that
secondary evidence may be used without further ado in
such a case, see, e. g., Hartzell v. United States, 72 F. 2d
569 (CA8 1934), applicant's argument is nevertheless
not without merit:
"[T]he policy of the original document requirement,
and probably the weight of reason, supports the
view of those courts equally numerous who demand . . . that before secondary evidence is used,
the proponent must show either that he has made
reasonable efforts without avail to secure the original from its possessor, or circumstances which persuade the court that such efforts would have been
fruitless."

Opinion in Chambers

C. McCormick, Evidence § 202, p. 415 (1954), and cases
cited. It is noteworthy in this regard that the District
Court rejected evidence offered by applicant tending to
show that the phone number in question was not registered to the purported narcotics trafficker before December 1970.
I cannot say that-these contentions are all frivolous.
The District Judge stated in his opinion denying bail
that "[n]o objections were interposed to the telephone
calls to Tiajuana [sic] made by co-defendant." He made
no mention, however, of applicant's challenge to the
hearsay declaration of the Mexican narcotics trafficker.
If this challenge should prevail, "it might well tip the
scales in defendant's favor, as it goes to the heart of the
case." Wolcher, supra, at 255, 100 L. Ed., at 1523.
Where an appeal is not frivolous or taken for delay,
bail "is to be denied only in cases in which, from substantial evidence, it seems clear that the right to bail
*Applicant also renewed at trial, and raises here, a question of
substantial nature which was before this Court last Term. The
District Court in this case entered a pretrail order suppressing
the contraband found in the truck. However, the Ninth Circuit
reversed, on an interlocutory appeal by the Government. It felt
that the actions of the customs agents constituted an "extended
border search," justified by the fact that the truck had been
under continuous surveillance from the time it crossed the Mexican
border. I granted a stay of the Court of Appeals' interlocutory
judgment pending disposition of the petition for certiorari; partly
because of questions concerning the propriety of the interlocutory
procedure, but also because of the differing approaches used by
the Ninth and the Fifth Circuits to justify extended border searches.
Harris v. United States, 400 U. S. 1211 (1970). The full Court,
however, denied certiorari. Harris v. United States, 400 U. S.
1060 (1971). This action does not necessarily indicate a view as
to the merits of either of the questions above. Possibly the interlocutory posture of the case was the determining factor. Nevertheless, applicant's Fourth Amendment claims have not been considered in the decision to grant this application. Cf. Drifka v.
Brainard,89 S. Ct. 434, 21 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1968).

may be abused or the community may be threatened
by the applicant's release." Leigh v. United States, 82
S. Ct. 994, 996, 8 L. Ed. 2d 269, 271 (1962); accord,
Rehman v. California,85 S. Ct. 8, 13 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1964).
According to the Solicitor General, the District Judge
denied bail in part because "there was reason to believe that defendant, who had no employment, would
not respond to required future appearances and would
be a danger to the community." Applicant's Bail Reform Act form indicates, however, that he is a selfemployed auto mechanic making $150 per week, that
he has lived in Los Angeles for the past eight years,
that he has several relatives, including his mother and
a sister, living there, and that he has never failed to
make a required court appearance while on bail. The
moving papers further indicate that applicant was at
liberty after sentencing, pursuant to a stay of execution
granted by the Court of Appeals, and that he voluntarily
submitted to the authorities upon the expiration of the
stay. There is not such "substantial evidence" in this
record to justify denying bail on the ground that applicant is a flight risk.
Furthermore, a far stronger showing of danger to the
community must be made than is apparent from this
record to justify a denial of bail on that ground. See,
e. g., United States v. Erwing, 280 F. Supp. 814 (ND
Cal. 1968). Accordingly, bail should be granted pending disposition of the appeal in this case, pursuant to the
standards set forth in the Bail Reform Act.
It is so ordered.
