PICARD v. CONNOR
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIRST CIRCUIT

No. 70-96.

Argued November 17, 1971-Decided December 20, 1971

A grand jury returned a murder indictment against a named individual "and John Doe, the true name and a more particular description of the said John Doe being to the said Jurors unknown."
After respondent's arrest the indictment was amended pursuant
to state law to substitute respondent's name for "John Doe."
The highest state court affirmed respondent's subsequent conviction, rejecting his challenge to the legality of the indictment made
on the ground that the amending procedure did not comply with
the statute. Respondent subsequently filed a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus in the District Court, which dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the procedure
by which respondent was brought to trial was violative of equal
protection. The court rejected petitioner's contention that respondent, who had not previously raised the equal protectipn issue,
had not exhausted available state judicial remedies as required by
28 U. S. C. § 2254, holding that respondent had presented the
state court with "an opportunity to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing upon [his] constitutional claim." Held:
The substance of a federal habeas corpus claim must in the first
instance be fairly presented to the state courts, and since on the
record'and argument before it the State's highest court had no fair
opportunity to consider and act upon the equal protection claim,
the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondent had exhausted hi* state remedies. Pp. 275-278.
434 F. 2d 673, reversed and remanded.

respondent.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, reversing
the District Court's dismissal of respondent's petition
for a writ of federal habeas corpus,' held that "the
procedure by which [respondent] was brought to trial
deprived him of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee
of equal protection of the laws." 434 F. 2d 673, 674
(1970). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that respondent had not attacked his conviction on the equal
protection ground, either in the state courts or in his
federal habeas petition:
"[Respondent] ,did not present the constitutional
question to the Massachusetts court in the particular focus in which this opinion is directed. We suggested it when the case reached us, and invited the
Commonwealth to file a supplemental brief. Not
unnaturally its first contention was to assert
that [respondent] had not exhausted his state
remedy . . . ." Ibid.
The Court of Appeals rejected that contention and held
that respondent had exhausted available state judicial
remedies, as -required by 28 U. S. C. § 2254,2 because he
1308 F. Supp. 843 (Mass. 1970).
2 Title 28 U. S. C. § 2254 provides in pertinent part:
"(b) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall
not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted
the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that there is

had "presented the [state] court with 'an opportunity
to apply controlling legal principles to the facts bearing
upon [his] constitutional claim.'" Ibid. We granted
certiorari to consider that ruling in light of the command of § 2254. 402 U. S. 942 (1971). We hold that
the State's objection should have been sustained, and we
therefore reverse for further proceedings, see Slayton v.
Smith, ante, p. 53, without reaching the merits of the
constitutional question decided by the Court of Appeals.'
A Massachusetts grand jury returned an indictment
for murder against Donald Landry "and John Doe, the
true name and a more particular description of the
said John Doe being to the said Jurors unknown."
After respondent's arrest, the indictment was amended
in a proceeding pursuant to a fictitious-name statute,
Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. c, 277, § 19,' to substitute respondeither an"absence of available State corrective process or the existence
of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the
rights of the prisoner.
"(c) An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the
remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of
this section, if he has the right under the law .of the State to raise,
by any available procedure, the question presented."
3 Respondent does not contend that there are no available state
judicial remedies through which he can present the equal protection
claim. It appears that Massachusetts provides postconviction procedures adequate to adjudicate that claim, either by motion for a
new trial, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c. 278, § 29; see Earl v. Commonwealth, 356 Mass. 181, 248 N. E. 2d 498 (1969), or by writ of error,
Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., c.250; see Cortellesso v. Commonwealth, 354
Mass. 514, 238 N. E. 2d 516 (1968); Crowell v. Commonwiealth, 352
Mass. 288, 225 N. E. 2d 330 (1967); Shoppers' World, Inc. v. Board
of Assessors, 348 Mass. 366, 376 n. 9, 203 N. E. 2d 811, 819 n. 9
(1965).
4 "If the name of an accused person is unknown to the grand jury,
he may be described by a fictitious name or by any other practicable
description, with an allegation that his real name is unknown. An
indictment of the defendant by a fictitious or erroneous name shall

ent's name for "John Doe." The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed respondent's subsequent
conviction, sub nom. Commonwealth v. Doherty,. 353
Mass. 197, 229 N. E. 2d 267 (1967).
Among
other grounds of appeal, respondent challenged the
legality of the indictment. The gist of respondent's
argument, which he also asserted during various trial
proceedings, was that the amending procedure did not
comply with the statute as construed by the Massachusetts courts, with the result that he had not been
lawfully indicted for the crime. See Commonwealth v.
Gedzium, 259 Mass. 453, 156 N. E. 890 (1927).' The
only suggestions of a claimed denial of a federal right
were statements in respondent's brief questioning the
continuing validity of the holding in Gedzium that the
provision of the Fifth Amendment that "[n]o person
shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of
a Grand Jury" was inapplicable to the States. Id.,
at 457, 156 N. E:, at 891; see Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884).
We have examined the
not be ground for abatement; but if at any subsequent stage of the
proceedings his true name is discovered, it shall be entered on the

record and may be used in the subsequent proceedings, with a
reference to the fact that he was indicted by the name or description mentioned in the indictment."
5 Although the Massachusetts Constitution does not expressly provide for grand jury indictments, the Massachusetts courts have
construed Art. XII of the Declaration of Rights to require that
"'no person . . . shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise
infamous crime . . . unless he shall have been previously charged
on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury.'" Jones v.
Robbins, 74 Mass. 329, 344-345 (1857).
6 In arguing his first assignment of error:
"[T]he dismissal in the Gedzium case of the applicability of the
Fifth Amendment provision . . . would appear to be in need of reexamination, in the light of the development by the United States

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Supreme Court . . . of the doctrine of applicability of guarantees
of the Federal Bill of Rights to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment." Brief for Connor in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 13.
In arguing his third and fourth assignments of error:
"As set forth supra in the argument in support of the first Assignment, the indictment of 'John Doe' was a nullity because it was a
general indictment, not limited to any identifiable individual. Since
this is a capital case, the defendant Connor was prosecuted in violation of his constitutional right to due process in that he was put
to trial without having been indicted by a Grand Jury." Id., at 14.
7 Nor did respondent's federal habeas petition assert a denial of
equal protection. The petition alleges that "[h]e was brought to
trial without indictment or presentment in violation of the Fifth
Amendment and of the Massachusetts Constitution, . . . [of] the
statutory provisions of [the fictitious-name statute], and of the rule
of the common law that an indictment in a capital case . . . forbids
any amendment to such an indictment." In his memorandum in
support of the petition, respondent argued that the Massachusetts
indictment procedure "must be administered in accordance with
the principles pertaining to the Grand Jury as established by the
law of the land, i. e., in accordance with due process as created by
the common law and adopted by our Constitution. . . . In accordance with these principles, since the indictment did not name nor
describe [respondent], it was, as to him, a nullity, and remained so
after amendment." The District Court, noting that respondent had
"argued indiscriminately on the basis of the statutes and constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as upon federal
grounds," 308 F. Supp., at 845 n. 2, considered respondent's contention to be "that the amendment of the indictment to substitute
Connor's name for John Doe was a violation of the Fifth Amendment." The court rejected that contention on the ground "that the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not make applicable to the states the grand jury requirement of the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 845.

PICARD v. CONNOR

Opinion of the Court

270

It has been settled since Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241
(1886), that a state prisoner must normally exhaust available state judicial remedies before a federal court will
entertain his petition for habeas corpus. See, e. g.,
Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 229 (1970); Irvin v.
Dowd, 359 U. S. 394, 404-405 (1959); Ex parte Hawk,
321 U. S. 114 (1944). The exhaustion-of-state-remedies
doctrine, now codified in the federal habeas statute, 28
U. S. C. §§ 2254 (b) and (c),' reflects a policy of federalstate comity, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 419-420 (1963);
Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U. S. 19, 27 (1939), "an accommodation of our federal system designed to give the State
the initial 'opportunity to pass upon and correct' alleged
violations of its prisoners' federal rights." Wilwording
v. Swenson, ante, p. 249, at 250. We have consistently adhered to this federal policy, for "it would be
unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal
district court to upset a state court conviction without
an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation." Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204
(1950) (overruled in other respects, Fay v. Noia, supra,
at 435-436). It follows, of course, that once the federal
claim has been fairly presented to the state courts, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied. See, e. g., Wilwording
v. Swenson, supra, at 250; Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U. S.
40, 42-43 (1967); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 447-450
(1953).
We emphasize that the federal claim must be fairly
presented to the state courts. If the exhaustion doctrine is to prevent "unnecessary conflict between courts
equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the
Constitution," Ex parte Royall, supra, at 251, it is not
sufficient merely that the federal habeas applicant has

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
Opinion of the Court

404 U. S.

been through the state courts. The rule would serve no
purpose if it could be satisfied by raising one claim in the
state courts and another in the federal courts. Only if
the state courts have had the first opportunity to hear
the claim sought to be vindicated in a federal habeas
proceeding does it make sense to speak of the exhaustion
of state remedies. Accordingly, we have required a state
prisoner to present the state courts with the same claim
he urges upon the federal courts. See Darr v. Burford,
supra, at 203; Davis v. Burke, 179 U. S. 399, 401-403
(1900).
Respondent challenged the validity of his indictment
at every stage of the proceedings in the Massachusetts
courts. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, 434 F. 2d,
at 674, this is not a case in which factual allegations were
made to the federal courts that were not before the state
courts, see, e. g., United States ex rel. Boodie v. Herold,
349 F. 2d 372 (CA2 1965); Schiers v. California,333 F.
2d 173 (CA9 1964), nor a case in which an intervening
change in federal law cast the legal issue in a fundamentally different light, see, e. g., Blair v. California,340
F. 2d 741 (CA9 1965); Pennsylvania ex rel. Raymond v.
Rundle, 339 F. 2d 598 (CA3 1964). We therefore put
aside consideration of those types of cases. The question here is simply whether, on the record and argument
before it, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court had
a fair opportunity to consider the equal protection claim
and to correct that asserted constitutional defect in respondent's conviction. We think not.
Until he reached this Court," respondent never contended that the method by which he was brought to trial
9The decision of the Court of Appeals prompted respondent, for
the first time in any court, to advance the argument in this Court
that "since indictment is the only process provided for the finding
of probable cause in Massachusetts prior to trial, its denial in

PICARD v. CONNOR
270

Opinion of the Court

denied him equal protection of the laws. Rather, from
the outset respondent consistently argued that he had
been improperly indicted under Massachusetts law and,
to the extent he raised a federal constitutional claim at
all, that the indictment procedure employed in his case
could not be approved without reference to whether the
Fifth Amendment's requirement of a grand jury indictment applied to the States. He adverted to the Fourteenth Amendment solely as it bore upon that submission.1" The equal protection issue entered this case
only because the Court of Appeals injected it.
We are thus unable to agree with that court that respondent provided the Massachusetts "court with 'an
opportunity to apply controlling legal principles to the
facts bearing upon [his] constitutional claim.'" 434 F.
2d, at 674. To be sure, respondent presented all the
facts. Yet the constitutional claim the Court of Appeals
found inherent in those facts was never brought to the
attention of the, state courts. The Supreme Judicial
Court dealt with the arguments respondent offered; we
cannot fault that court for failing also to consider sua
sponte whether the indictment procedure denied respondent equal protection of the laws. Obviously there are
instances in which "the ultimate question for disposition,"
United States ex rel. Kemp v. Pate, 359 F. 2d 749, 751
(CA7 1966), will be the same despite variations in the
legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.
A ready example is a challenge to a confession predicated
upon psychological as well as physical coercion. See
Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S.1, 16 (1963). Hence,
Connor's case alone was undoubtedly a violation of Connor's federal rights not only as to due process, but also equal protection,

under the Fourteenth Amendment, as stated by the Chief Judge of
the Circuit Court." Brief for Respondent 15.
10 Respondent reiterated these contentions in his federal habeas
petition. See n. 7, supra.

we do not imply that respondent could have raised the
equal protection claim only by citing "book and verse
on the federal constitution." Daudhartyv. Gladden, 257
F. 2d 750, 758 (CA9 1958); see Kirby v. Warden, 296 F.
2d 151 (CA4 1961). We simply hold that the substance
of a federal habeas'corpus claim must first be presented
to Athe state courts. The claim that an indictment is
invalid is not the substantial equivalent of a claim that
it results in an unconstitutional discrimination. See
Rose v. Dickson, 327 F. 2d 27, 29 (CA9 1964); Morris v.
Mayo, 277 F. 2d 103 (CA5 1960). The judgment of the
Court qf Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is
remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
dissenting.
With all respect, I think that in this case we carry
the rule of exhaustion of state remedies too far. Connor's name was added to the indictment after it was
returned by the state grand jury, he being substituted
for "John Doe." He raised in his brief before the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts his claim that
such a substitution denied him that quantum of due
process required by the Fourteenth Amendment "in that
he was put to trial without having been indicted by a
Grand Jury."'
He did not refer to the Equal Protection
Clause which is also a part of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that is a nicety irrelevant to the maintenance
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

1 The Court properly says that respondent tendered the validity

of Commonwealth v. Gedzium, 259 Mass. 453, 156 N. E. 890, to the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. That, however, was in
his first assignment of error. But in his third and fourth assignments of error he alleged that he was prosecuted "in violation of
his constitutional right to due process in that he was put to trial
without having been indicted by a Grand Jury."

of healthy state-federal relations on which the Court
makes the present decision turn. The concept of due
process is broad and expansive, and "the concepts of equal
protection and due process, both stemming from our
American ideal of fairness, are not mutually exclusive."
Boiling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499. We have thus held
that the denial of equal protection, viz., invidious discrimination, may be "so unjustifiable as to be violative of
due process."

Ibid.

As MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN said in

Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371, 388 (concurring

opinion), "The question that the Court treats exclusively as one of due process inevitably implicates considerations of both due process and equal protection." That
is likewise true here.

Moreover, a due process point is plainly raised where

an accused claims that no grand jury found "probable
cause" to indict him, that its only finding concerned
someone unknown at the time.

If Connor had complained of a coerced confession,

or of perjured testimony, and the facts on which he relied

497, 499. But the extent to which the two concepts merge has
been a*subject of debate since Representative John A. Bingham of
Ohio, an architect of the Fourteenth Amendment, used the phrases
"due process" and "equal protection" interchangeably on the floor
of Congress. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1088-1089. See,
e. g., Wilson, The Merging Concepts of Liberty and Equality, 12
Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 182, Antieau, Equal Protection Outside the
Clause, 40 Calif. L. Rev. 362, Tussman & tenBroek, The Equal Protection of the Laws, 37 Calif. L. Rev. 341. Compare Douglas v.
California, 372 U. S. 353, and Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12, with
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, and Powell v. Alabama, 287
U. S. 45.
There is apparently a similar controversy in India, whose constitution also contains both a due process and equal protection
clause. See, e. g., Narain, Equal Protection Guarantee and the
Right of Property Under the Indian Constitution, 15 Int. & Comp.

were developed in the state court, the constitutional
questions would surely have been sufficiently raised without reference to the precise constitutional provisions involved. The situation here is no different.3
3

Daugharty v. Gladden, 257 F. 2d 750 (CA9), which the Court
cites, is instructive. Daugharty was an indigent state prisoner. He
appealed the denial of state habeas corpus to the intermediate
state appellate court, but that court dismissed the appeal because
Daugharty could not afford to supply an appellate transcript. He
then moved the state supreme court for an order requiring that he
be supplied a transcript free of charge, and when that motion was
denied, sought federal habeas corpus. The District Judge denied the
application for a writ on the grounds Daugharty had failed to
exhaust state remedies. Despite the fact that Daugharty never even
mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment, much less the Equal Protection Clause, the Court of Appeals held that his motion in the
state supreme court satisfied the exhaustion requirement.
"In moving the Oregon Supreme Court for an order .requiring
that a transcript be supplied without expense to him, Daugharty
called attention to his inability to pay for such a record. This
provided that court with all of the facts necessary to give application to the constitutional principle upon which appellant relies....
[E]xhaustion of state remedies is not to be denied because the
Fourteenth Amehdment was not specifically mentioned." Id., at
758.
Analogously, the Court of Appeals said in the instant case:
"Petitioner did not present the constitutional question to the
Massachusetts court in the particular focus in which this opinion is
directed. We suggested it when the case reached us, and invited
the Commonwealth to file a supplemental brief. Not unnaturally.
its first contention was to assert that petitioner had not exhausted
his state remedy, citing Needel v. Scafati, 1 Cir., 1969, 412 F. 2d
761, cert. denied 396 U. S. 861, .

.

. and Subilosky v. Common-

wealth, 1 Cir., 1969, 412 F. 2d 691. We find these cases inapposite.
This opinion considers neither facts, as in Needel, nor precedent, as
in Subilosky, that was not available to the Massachusetts court
when petitioner was before it. Petitioner presented the court with
Ian opportunity to apply controlling legal principles to the facts
bearing upon [his] constitutional claim.' United States ex rel. Kemp

J., dissenting

The judges to whom that issue of law is tendered are
learned men who we must assume are knowledgeable as
to the meaning of due process. A law student who tendered a brief that left due process at large would certainly
not be worthy of an "A." But the nicety of analysis
which we associate with scholarship has no functional
role to play in this area of exhaustion of state remedies.
When we go to that extreme, we make a trap out of the
exhaustion doctrine which promises to exhaust the litigant and his resources, not the remedies.
I fear that our reluctance to backstop the Court of
Appeals in the present case is symptomatic of this Court's
trend to sidestep all possible controversies so, as it hopes,
to let them disappear. Of course we should remit a litigant to his state tribunal if facts have emerged which were
not known at the time of the trial or if intervening decisions have outdated the earlier state decision. No such
situation exists here. The facts are simple and uncontested: Connor's Fiame was substituted for John Doe after
the indictment was returned. The point of law is clear
now and will be no clearer on the remand. Its vulnerability tested by due process was as obvious when the
case was before the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as it now is. I think the Court of Appeals
acted responsibly in ruling on it. We should decide the
merits here and now. Endless repetitive procedures are
encouraged by today's ruling on exhaustion of remedies.
I would bring this litigation to an end today by applying
the exhaustion-of-remedy rule to terminate rather than
multiply procedures that now engulf the state-federal
regime.

of the exhaustion ...doctrine. Sullivan v. Scafati, 1 Cir., 1970, 428
