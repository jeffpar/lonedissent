STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 70-5343.

Decided November 16, 1971

Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. The
jrdgment is vacated and the, case is remanded to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for
further consideration in light of Younger v. Gilmore, ante,
p. 15.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

concurring.

Petitioners are prisoners who claim that the prison
authorities have denied them access to law books
needed to seek judicial remedies. They are inmates of
the Bexar County Jail in Texas and instituted this action
in the District Court to restrain the respondent's interference with their reasonable access to hardbound law
books and other legal matter.1 They asserted that county
jail regulations and practices deprived them of their
rights to seek judicial redress. Their custodians answered
that prison security necessitated removing hardback
covers as part of an overall scheme to arrest smuggling
of contraband. Without conducting a hearing into the
matter, the District Court summarily dismissed the
complaint.2
'In their complaint petitioners relied upon 28 U. S. C. § 1343 (3);
28 U. S. C. 8 2201; and 42 U. S. C. § 1983.

The question is an important one in the evolution by
statutes and constitutional decisions of a Bill of Rights
for prisoners. Prisoners are not statistics, known only
to a computer, but humans entitled to all the amenities
and privileges of other persons, save .as confinement and
necessary security measures curtail their activities.
Whatever security measures may be needed respecting
books, it is not conceivably plausible to maintain that
essential books can be totally banned.
That question is submerged in this case as the initial
issue concerns these prisoners' request to proceed in
forma pauperis on appeal from the District Court's dismissal of their action, the Court of Appeals having refused
to docket their cases without prepayment of filing fees
and security which litigants normally advance.
Petitioners filed a timely notice of appeal and pursuant
to Fed. Rule App. Proc. 24 (a) (first paragraph) sought
from the District Judge leave to appeal in forma pauperis
as to prepayment of a $25 filing fee 3 and the $250 minimum security deposit required by Fed. Rule App. Proc. 7.
The District Judge refused the request, certifying in relevant part that: "This Court... is of the opinion that any
appeal taken from the order of denial in this case would
be frivolous, without merit, and not taken in good faith." 4
No other explanation was offered although in his earlier
unreported order dismissing the original action the District Judge said that prisoners do not have "a right to
be furnished with an extensive collection of legal materials" and that courts "may not interfere with the
conduct of a prison." 5

Petitioners then applied to the Court of Appeals for
a similar waiver of filing fees and security. Their application was denied without opinion 6 and their motion for
reconsideration was also refused without opinion.7 Presented with their motion for reconsideration were memoranda posing their primary contention now before this
Court that these denials of leave to proceed in forma
pauperis offended these petitioners' rights of equal access
to judicial machinery.8

We have held, in line with Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S.
12 (1956), that an indigent prisoner cannot be deprived
of a direct criminal appeal or of state habeas relief solely
on account of his inability to prepay docketing fees.
Smith v. Bennett, 365 U. S. 708 (1961) ($4 filing fee for
state habeas action and $3 filing fee for appeal therefrom); Burns v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 252 (1959) ($20 filing fee
for discretionary review of criminal appeal).' In 1892

Congress authorized the federal courts to provide the disadvantaged with a wide range of in forma pauperis relief.

8 The issue at stake in the appeal was clearly not frivolous as
indicated by our decision in Younger v. Gilmore, ante, p. 15,
that there are limits on the extent to which prison officials may
restrict inmates' access to law books. On at least 21 occasions
this Court has reversed lower courts' holdings that only frivolous
claims were sought to be presented. Rubio v. United States, 387

generous provision, now codified at 28 U. S. C. § 1915,
have been limited, however, by the important proviso
added in 1910 (36 Stat. 866) which, as now amended,
reads:
"An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if
the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken
in good faith."
"Good faith" has been defined as a requirement that an
appeal present a nonfrivolous question for review. If
the district court certifies that an appeal would not
present such a question, then an indigent may ask the
court of appeals for permission to proceed in forma
pauperis. That court must grant the renewed motion if
after a de novo determination it disagrees with the district court's application of the good-faith test. If both
lower courts refuse permission, then, unless this Court
vacates the court of appeals' finding, the pauper's appeal is ended without a hearing on the merits. See Fed.
Rule App. Proc. 24 (a). It is important that in all of
these proceedings the only cognizable issue is whether a
summary survey (as opposed to plenary deliberation)
suggests that a substantial argument could be presented.
For a discussion of the procedures employed see Coppedge
v. United States, 369 U. S. 438 (1962); Hardy v. United
States, 375 U. S. 277 (1964).

Our holdings have steadily chipped away at the proposition that appeals of the poor can be disposed of solely
on summary and abbreviated inquiries into frivolity
rather than upon the plenary consideration granted paying appellants."

Constitution against the Federal Government the concept of equal

protection of the laws is incorporated into the Due Process Clause

of the Fifth Amendment. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954).

Board, 357 U. S. 214 (1958), we held that a State may
not withhold a transcript and thereby deny an appeal
to a poor man merely because a trial judge believed his
own conduct had avoided the production of nonfrivolous
questions for review. See also Ross v. Schneckloth, 357
U. S. 575 (1958). In Lane v. Brown, 372 U. S. 477
(1963), we decided that an impoverished prisoner's appeal from a state coram nobis hearing could not be
thwarted simply because a public defender officer believed his case lacked merit. In Ellis v. United States,
356 U. S. 674 (1958), we emphasized that a criminal
appellant seeking to establish nonfrivolity under 28
U. S. C. § 1915 is entitled to more than appointed counsel's private view that his appeal would be worthless and
that if counsel withdrew for that reason the Court of
Appeals was duty bound to replace him. We have also
held that a Court of Appeals may not overrule the permission granted by a District Court to proceed in forma
pauperis, McGann v. United States, 362 U. S. 309 (1960),
but that a Court of Appeals must review de novo a trial
judge's certification that an appeal would not be in good
faith, Johnson v. United States, 352 U. S. 565 (1957).
Moreover, in federal criminal appeals on direct review
most circuits have provided as a matter of course the
entire panoply of § 1915 relief, including counsel, transcripts, and waiver of filing fees, and security, merely
upon a showing of poverty. And, to the extent that the
nonfrivolity test is still enforceable elsewhere, our opinions in Coppedge, supra, and Hardy, supra,have partially
attenuated its harsher effects by requiring the appointment of counsel and the provision of transcripts for the
preliminary purpose of ascertaining whether appeals
would produce worthwhile issues.
It is true, of course, that most of these decisions in-

volved criminal appeals rather than civil appeals.1 But
the equal protection concept is "not limited to criminal prosecutions" and its "protections extend as well to
civil matters." See Williams v. Shaffer, 385 U. S. 1037,
1039 (1967). Indeed, last Term, in Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971), we held on equal protection and
due process grounds that a State could not deny a divorce
to an impecunious wife solely because she could not pay
relatively small filing and service-of-process fees. Moreover, of the Griffin progeny at least two of our opinions
concerned civil habeas appeals, condemning filing fees
substantially less burdensome than those required below
by the Fifth Circuit. See Long v. District Court of Iowa,
385 U. S. 192 (1966), and Smith v. Bennett, supra. And
lower court decisions have nurtured the sturdy expansion
of Griffin to non-habeas civil appeals. In a civil rights
case similar to the instant one, Lockhart v. D'Urso, 408
F. 2d 354 (1969), the Third Circuit held that in forma
pauperis aid should normally be granted as a matter of
course in order to minimize courts' treatment of litigants
based upon economic circumstances. Id., at 355. The
upshot of these judicial pronouncements was forcefully
summarized by Mr. Justice Black last Term: "In my
view, the decision in Boddie v. Connecticut can safely
rest on only one crucial foundation-that the civil courts
of the United States and each of the States belong to the
people of this country and that no person can be denied
access to those courts, either for a trial or an appeal,
because he cannot pay a fee, finance a bond, risk a
penalty, or afford to hire an attorney." Meltzer v.

to civil appeals in the federal courts, see Blackmun, Allowance of
In Forma Pauperis Appeals in § 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases,

(dissent from denial of certiorari).1
The elusive nature of the frivolity standard is partly
demonstrated by the number of times this Court has
vacated findings of bad faith by the lower courts.'" It is
no answer that we may continue to rectify such errors
on an ad hoc basis, for even so indigents are nonetheless
required to return to courts of appeals and only thenafter substantial delay-obtain plenary review on the
merits. Coppedge, supra, at 453. Wealthier litigants,
of course, have no such hurdles to pass before obtaining
full review of their assignments of error. Although these
hurdles might be justifiable where indigents requested
more substantial relief, they are too onerous where all
that is at stake is the prepayment of a $25 filing fee and
$250 security deposit.
It is apparent that this disparate treatment has the
effect of classifying appellants according to wealth, which,
like race, is a suspect classification. Griffin v. Illinois,
351 U. S. 12 (1956); Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U. S. 663 (1966). See also Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969). Accordingly, this classification could withstand challenge only upon a showing of
compelling circumstances. Respondent offers none but
simply repeats the discredited maxim that paupers' appeals are privileges, not rights."4
Thus, I would not remand this case on the limited
ground that the Court of Appeals may have underestimated the weight of the petitioners' claim. Rather, I
would hold that upon a showing of poverty courts of

appeals henceforth must waive prepayment and may
not inquire into whether an appeal may eventually pose
a fruitful issue, at least in cases, such as this one, involving fundamental civil liberties.
I would grant certiorari and remand the case to the
Fifth Circuit so that these petitioners may have their
appeal docketed without prepayment of fees or security.
