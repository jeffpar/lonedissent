OCTOBER TERM, 1970
Per Curiam

KEYES v. SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
ON MOTION TO VACATE STAY

Decided April 26, 1971
Court of Appeals' stay of District Court's desegregation order pending issuance of this Court's decisions in Swann v. Board of Education, ante, p. 1, and related cases, vacated now that the opinions
in those cases have been issued.
Vacated.
PER CURIAM.

The sole basis for the Tenth Circuit's action in granting
the stay of the District Court's order in this case was the
view "that it would be unfair to the School District to
compel it to take further steps in the implementation of
the total plan until [the Tenth Circuit] and the party
litigants have the benefit of the United States Supreme
Court decisions in the Swann and combined desegregation cases ....
The decisions in those cases having now been announced, it is proper to vacate the stay and remit the
matter to the Court of Appeals freed of its earlier speculation as to the bearing of our decision in Swann and
related cases.
We, of course, intimate no views upon the merits of
the underlying issues.
