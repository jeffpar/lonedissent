OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Per Curiam

468 U. S.

PAYNE v. VIRGINIA
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF VIRGINIA
No. 82-6935.

Decided July 5, 1984

Held: The Double Jeopardy Clause barred the state-court prosecution and
conviction of petitioner for the lesser included offense of robbery that
followed his prior conviction for capital murder committed during the
perpetration of the robbery.
Certiorari granted; reversed.
PER CURIAM.

This petition for certiorari seeks review of a judgment of
the Supreme Court of Virginia rejecting petitioner's double
jeopardy challenge to a conviction for robbery which followed
a prior conviction for capital murder committed during the
perpetration of the robbery while armed with a deadly
weapon. In this case, as in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S.
682 (1977) (per curiam), where "conviction of a greater
crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser
crime, robbery... ,the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the lesser crime after conviction of the greater
one." Ibid. See also In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176, 188
(1889).
Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis is granted, the petition for writ of certiorari is
granted, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia
is reversed. Harrisv. Oklahoma, supra.
It is so ordered.
