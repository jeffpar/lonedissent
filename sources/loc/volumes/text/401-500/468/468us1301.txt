OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES
IN CHAMBERS

GARRISON, WARDEN, ET AL. v. HUDSON
'ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-1061 (83-2144).

Decided July 6, 1984

An application to stay the order, in habeas corpus proceedings, of the Federal District Court (as directed by the Court of Appeals) for a state-court
retrial of respondent state prisoner prior to August 18, 1984, is granted
pending this Court's disposition of applicants' petition for certiorari to
review the Court of Appeals' judgment ordering habeas corpus relief.
Respondent's scheduled retrial some six weeks before the start of this
Court's October 1984 Term would effectively deprive this Court of
jurisdiction to consider the petition for writ of certiorari. Moreover,
the balance of harm favors applicants.

Circuit Justice.
On June 29, 1984, applicants, the Warden and Attorney
General of the State of North Carolina, filed a petition for
writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In respondent's
second federal appeal concerning his murder conviction and
life sentence, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of
the United States District Court for the Western District
of North Carolina and directed that a writ of habeas corpus
issue to release respondent from confinement if applicants
fail to retry him within a reasonable time. Judgment order
reported at 732 F. 2d 150 (1984). The District Court then
ordered retrial prior to August 18, 1984. Applicants challenge the Court of Appeals' decision in their certiorari petition, No. 83-2144, and seek to stay the scheduled retrial until
this Court acts on the petition for certiorari. Hudson filed
a response to the application earlier today asserting that the
decision of the Court of Appeals is correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER,

OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion in Chambers

468 U. S.

The petition for certiorari would not in the normal course
be acted on by this Court before the start of the October 1984
Term-some six weeks after the scheduled retrial. See this
Court's Rule 22.4. Retrial of respondent by August 18,
1984, prior to the "first Monday in October" would effectively
deprive this Court of jurisdiction to consider the petition for
writ of certiorari. Applicants assert that their right to a
review of the holding of the Court of Appeals will be extinguished if they are compelled to retry respondent on or about
August 18. When, as in this case, "the normal course of
appellate review might otherwise cause the case to become
moot," In re Bart, 82 S. Ct. 675, 676, 7 L. Ed. 2d 767, 768
(1962) (Warren, C. J., in chambers), issuance of a stay is warranted. The balance of harm favors applicants; foreclosure
of certiorari review by this Court would impose irreparable
harm upon applicants. In contrast, a 6-week delay of the
scheduled retrial would not impose an unreasonable delay on
respondent who has remained in confinement under a life
sentence since 1977.
I therefore grant the application for a stay of the order of
the United States District Court for the Western District of
North Carolina, pending disposition of the petition for writ of
certiorari in No. 83-2144.
It is so ordered.
