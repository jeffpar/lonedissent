OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES IN
CHAMBERS

HANRAHAN

ET AL.

v. HAMPTON

ET AL.

ON MOTION TO RECUSE

No. 79-912.

Motion to recuse MR.

Decided April 30, 1980*

JUSTIC REHNQUIST

is denied.

MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST.

Plaintiffs-respondents and their counsel in these cases have
moved that I "be recused from the proceedings in this case"
for the reasons stated in their 14-page motion and their five
Appendices filed with the Clerk of this Court on April 3, 1980.
The motion is opposed by the state-defendant petitioners in
the action. Since generally the Court as an institution leaves
such motions, even though they be addressed to it, to the decision of the individual Justices to whom they refer, see Jewell
Ridge Coal Corp. v. Mine Workers, 325 U. S. 897 (1945)
(denial of petition for rehearing) (Jackson, J., concurring),
I shall treat the motion as addressed to me individually. I
have considered the motion, the Appendices, the response of
the state defendants, 28 U. S. C. ยง 455 (1976 ed. and Supp.
III), and the current American Bar Association Code of Judicial Conduct, and the motion is accordingly
Denied.
