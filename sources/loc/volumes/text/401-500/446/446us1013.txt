REPORTER'S

NoTE

The next page is purposely numbered 1301. The numbers between
1011 and 1301 were intentionally omitted, in order to make it possible to
publish in-chambers opinions with permanent page numbers, thus making
the official citations available upon publication of the preliminary prints
of the United States Reports.
