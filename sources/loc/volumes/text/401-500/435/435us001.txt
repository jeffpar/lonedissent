ON

APPEAL FROIA THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

No. 77-88. Decided February 27, 1978"
The provisions of the Social Security Act making benefits for aged, blind,
and disabled persons under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
program payable only to residents of the United States, defined as the 50
States and the District of Columbia, are not unconstitutional as applied
to persons who upon moving to Puerto Rico lost the benefits to which
they were entitled while residing in the United States. The constitutional right to travel does not embrace any such doctrine as would require payment of SSI benefits under such circumstances.
No. 77-88, 426 F. Supp. 1106, and No. 77-126, reversed.

PER CURLAM.

Certain benefits under the Social Security Act, as amended
in 1972, are payable only to residents of the United States,
defined as the 50 States and the District of Columbia. The
District Court for the District of Puerto Rico held in these
"Together with No. 77-126, Califano, Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare v. Colon et al., also on appeal from the same court.

cases that this geographic limitation is unconstitutional as
applied to persons who upon moving to Puerto Rico lost
the benefits to which they were entitled while residing in
the United States. The Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, responsible for the administration of the Social Security Act, has appealed.'

I
One of the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act
created a uniform program, known as the Supplemental
Security Income (SSI) program, for aid to qualified aged,
blind, and disabled persons. 86 Stat. 1465, 42 U. S. C. § 1381
et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V). This federally administered
program replaced the federal-state programs of Old Age Assistance, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U. S. C. § 301 et seq.; Aid to the Blind,
49 Stat. 645, 42 U. S. C. § 1201 et seq.; Aid to the Disabled,
64 Stat. 555, 42 U. S. C. § 1351 et seq.; and Aid to the Aged,
Blind, and Disabled, 42 U. S. C. § 1381 et seq.
The exclusion of Puerto Rico in the amended program is
apparent in the definitional section. Section 1611 (f) of the
Act, as set forth in 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (f) (1970 ed., Supp. V),
states that no individual is eligible for benefits during any
month in which he or she is outside the United States. The
Act defines "the United States" as "the 50 States and the
District of Columbia." § 1614 (e), as set forth in 42 U. S. C.
§ 1382c (e) (1970 ed., Supp. V). The repeal of the pre-existing programs did not apply to Puerto Rico. Thus persons
in Puerto Rico are not eligible to receive SSI benefits, but are
eligible to receive benefits under the pre-existing programs.'
Appellee Torres received SSI benefits while residing in
Connecticut; the benefits were discontinued when he moved

to Puerto Rico. Similarly, appellees Colon and Vega received
benefits as residents of Massachusetts and New Jersey, respectively, but lost them on moving to Puerto Rico.:
Torres filed a complaint in the District Court of Puerto Rico
claiming that the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the SSI
program was unconstitutional, and a three-judge court was
convened to adjudicate the suit. Viewing the geographic limitations in the law as an interference with the constitutional
right of residents of the 50 States and the District of Columbia
to travel, the court searched for a compelling governmental
interest to justify such interference. Finding none, the court
held §§ 1611 (f) and 1614 (e) unconstitutional as applied to
Torres. Torres v. Mathews, 426 F. Supp. 116.4 Soon after
that decision appellees Colon and Vega also sued in the Puerto
Rico District Court. Relying on the Torres decision, a single
judge enjoined the Social Security Administration from discontinuing their SSI benefits on the basis of their change of
residency to Puerto Rico.'
3 The record does not show whether the appellees applied for benefits
under the pre-existing programs while in Puerto Rico.
4The complaint had also relied on the equal protection component of the
Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in attacking the exclusion of
Puerto Rico from the SSI program. Acceptance of that claim would have
meant that all otherwise qualified persons in Puerto Rico are entitled to
SSI benefits, not just those who received such benefits before moving to
Puerto Rico. But the District Court apparently acknowledged that
Congress has the power to treat Puerto Rico differently, and that every
federal program does not have to be extended to it. Puerto Rico has a
relationship to the United States "that has no parallel in our history."

In Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), and Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250 (1974), this
Court held that laws prohibiting newly arrived residents in a
State or county from receiving the same vital benefits as other
residents unconstitutionally burdened the right of interstate
travel. As the Court said in Memorial Hospital, "the right of
interstate travel must be seen as insuring new residents the
same right to vital governmental benefits and privileges in the
States to which they migrate as are enjoyed by other residents."
Id., at 261.
In the present cases the District Court altogether transposed
that proposition. It held that the Constitution requires that
a person who travels to Puerto Rico must be given benefits
superior to those enjoyed by other residents of Puerto Rico if
the newcomer enjoyed those benefits in the State from which
he came. This Court has never held that the constitutional
right to travel embraces any such doctrine, and we decline to
do so now.' Such a doctrine would apply with equal force to
any benefits a State might provide for its residents, and would
require a State to continue to pay those benefits indefinitely to
any persons who had once resided there. And the broader
implications of such a doctrine in other areas of substantive
law would bid fair to destroy the independent power of each
6 The constitutional right of interstate travel is virtually unqualified.
United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 757-758 (1966); Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U. S. 88, 105-106 (1971). By contrast the "right" of international travel has been considered to be no more than an aspect of the
"liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Kent v. Dulles, 357 U. S. 116, 125 (1958); Aptheker v. Secretary of State,
378 U. S. 500, 505-506 (1964). As such this "right," the Court has held,
can be regulated within the bounds of due process. Zemel v. Rusk, 381
U. S. 1 (1965). For purposes of this opinion we may assume that there
is a virtually unqualified constitutional right to travel between Puerto Rico
and any of the 50 States of the Union.

State under our Constitution to enact laws uniformly applicable to all of its residents.
If there ever could be a case where a person who has moved
from one State to another might be entitled to invoke the law
of the State from which he came as a corollary of his constitutional right to travel, this is surely not it. For we deal here
with a constitutional attack upon a law providing for governmental payments of monetary benefits. Such a statute
"is entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality."
Mathews v. De Castro, 429 U. S. 181, 185 (1976). "So long
as its judgments are rational, and not invidious, the legislature's efforts to tackle the problems of the poor and the needy
are not subject to a constitutional straitjacket." Jefferson v.
Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 546 (1972). See also Califano v.
Jobst, 434 U. S. 47, 53-54; Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U. S. 199,
210 (1977); Helvering v. Davis, 301 U. S. 619, 640 (1937).'
The judgments are reversed.
So ordered.
MR. JusTIcE BRENNAN would affirm.
MR. JuSTICE MARSHALL would note probable jurisdiction

and set these cases for oral argument.

"At least three reasons have been advanced to explain the exclusion of
persons in Puerto Rico from the SSI program. First, because of the
unique tax status of Puerto Rico, its residents do not contribute to the
public treasury. Second, the cost of including Puerto Rico would be
extremely great-an estimated $300 million per year. Third, inclusion in
the SSI program might seriously disrupt the Puerto Rican economy. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Report of the Undersecretary's Advisory Group on Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands 6
(Oct. 1976).
