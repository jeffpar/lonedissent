BALLEW v. GEORGIA
CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS OF GEORGIA
No. 76-761.

Argued November 1, 1977-Decided March 21, 1978

Petitioner, who was charged with committing a misdemeanor, was tried
before a five-person jury pursuant to Georgia law, and convicted.
Though a criminal trial by a six-person jury is permissible under Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, petitioner maintains that a trial before a
jury of less than six is unconstitutional, a contention that the Georgia
courts rejected. Held: The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded. Pp. 229-245; 245; 245-246.
138 Ga. App. 530, 227 S. E. 2d 65, reversed and remanded.
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMiUN, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concluded
that a criminal trial to a jury of less than six persons substantially
threatens Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees. Georgia has
presented no persuasive argument to the contrary. Neither the financial
benefit nor the more dubious time-saving benefit claimed is a factor of
sufficient significance to offset the substantial threat to the constitutional guarantees that reducing the jury from six to five would create.

Pp. 229-245.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE concluded that a jury of less than six would not
satisfy the fair-cross-section requirement of the Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendments. P. 245.
M . JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHm JUSTICE and MR. JusTICE REHNQUIST joined, concluded that, though the line between fiveand six-member juries is difficult to justify, a line has to be drawn
somewhere if the substance of jury trial in criminal cases is to be
preserved. Pp. 245-246.

MR. JUsTIcE BLACKMUN announced the judgment of the
Court and delivered an opinion in which MR. JusTIcE STvBws

joined.
This case presents the issue whether a state criminal trial
to a jury of only five persons deprives the accused of the right
to trial by jury guaranteed to him by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.' Our resolution of the issue requires an
application of principles enunciated in Williams v. Florida,
399 U. S. 78 (1970), where the use of a six-person jury in a
state criminal trial was upheld against similar constitutional
attack.
I
In November 1973 petitioner Claude Davis Ballew was the
manager of the Paris Adult Theatre at 320 Peachtree Street,
Atlanta, Ga. On November 9 two investigators from the
Fulton County Solicitor General's office viewed at the theater
a motion picture film entitled "Behind the Green Door."
Record 46-48' 90. After they had seen the film, they obtained
*Charles.H. Keating, Jr., and James J. Clancy filed a brief for Citizens
for Decency Through Law, Inc., as amicus curiae urging affirmance.
'The Sixth Amendment reads:
"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have
been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him;
to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to
have the Assistance of Counsel for -his defence."
The Amendment's provision as to trial by jury is made applicable to the
States by the Fourteenth Amendment. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S.
145 (1968).

a warrant for its seizure, returned to the theater, viewed the
film once again, and seized it. Id., at 48-50, 91. Petitioner
and a cashier were arrested. Investigators returned to the
theater on November 26, viewed the film in its entirety,
secured still another warrant, and on November 27 once again
viewed the motion picture and seized a second copy of the

film. Id., at 53-55.
On September 14, 1974, petitioner was charged in a twocount misdemeanor accusation with
"distributing obscene materials in violation of Georgia
Code Section 26-2101 in that the said accused did, knowing the obscene nature thereof, exhibit a motion picture
film entitled 'Behind the Green Door' that contained
obscene and indecent scenes. . . ." App. 4-6.1
Petitioner was brought to trial in the Criminal Court of
Fulton County.3 After a jury of 5 persons had been selected
2

Georgia Code Ann. § 26-2101 (1972), in effect at the time of the alleged

offenses, was entitled "Distributing obscene materials" and read:
"(a) A person commits the offense of distributing obscene materials
when he sells, lends, rents, leases, gives, advertises, publishes, exhibits or
otherwise disseminates to any person any obscene material of any description, knowing the obscene nature thereof, or who offers to do so, or who
possesses such material with the intent so to do: Provided, that the word
'knowing' as used herein shall be deemed to be either actual or constructive
knowledge of the obscene contents of the subject-matter; and a person
has constructive knowledge of the obscene contents if he has knowledge of
facts which would put a reasonable and prudent man on notice as to the
suspect nature of the material.
"(b) Material is obscene if considered as a whole, applying community
standards, its predominant appeal is to prurient interest, that is, a
shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion, and utterly
without redeeming social value and if, in addition, it goes substantially
beyond customary limits of candor in describing or representing such
matters. ..

1975 Ga. Laws No. 204, p. 498, now Ga. Code Ann. § 26-2101 (Supp.
1977), entirely superseded the earlier version.

and sworn, petitioner moved that the court impanel a jury
of 12 persons. Record 37-38V That court, however, tried
its misdemeanor cases before juries of five persons pursuant to Ga. Const., Art. 6. § 16, ff 1, codified as Ga. Code
§ 2-5101 (1975), and to 1890-1891 Ga. Laws, No. 278,
pp. 937-938, and 1935 Ga. Laws, No. 38, p. 498.5 Petitioner
contended that for an obscenity trial, a jury of only five was
effective January 2, 1977, by the merger of that court with the Civil
Court of Fulton County into a tribunal now known as the State Court of
Fulton County. 1976 Ga. Laws No. 1004, p. 3023.
4 Petitioner asked, in the alternative, that the case be transferred to the
Fulton County Superior Court. That court had concurrent jurisdiction
over the case. Ga. Const., Art. 6, § 4, 1, codified as Ga. Code § 2-3901
(1975); Nobles v. State, 81 Ga. App. 229, 58 S. E. 2d 496 (1950). The
Superior Court could have impaneled a jury of 12. Ga. Const., Art. 6,
§ 16, 1, codified as Ga. Code § 2-5101 (1975). Because the State had
the choice of bringing the case in either the Criminal Court or the Superior
Court, petitioner argued that trial before the smaller jury violated equal
protection and due process guaranteed him under the Fourteenth Amendment. Record 12-13. The transfer was denied. He has not pressed the

contention before this Court, and we do not reach it.
5 1890-1891 Ga. Laws, No. 278, pp. 937-938, states in part:

"The proceedings [in the Criminal Court of Atlanta] after information or
accusation, shall conform to the rules governing like proceedings in the
Superior Courts, except that the jury in said court, shall consist of five,
to be stricken alternately b the defendant and State from a panel of
twelve. The defendant shall be entitled to four (4) strikes and the State
three (3) and the five remaining jurors shall compose the jury."
The cited 1935 statute changed the name of the Criminal Court of
Atlanta to the Criminal Court of Fulton County. It was intimated at
oral argument that only this particular court in Georgia employed fewer
than six jurors. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.
Effective March 24, 1976, the number of jurors in the Criminal Court
of Fulton County was changed from five to six. 1976 Ga. Laws No. 1003,
p. 3019.
Irrespective of its size, the Georgia jury in a criminal trial, in order to
convict, must do so by unanimous vote. Ball v. State, 9 Ga. App. 162,

constitutionally inadequate to assess the contemporary standards of the community. Record 13, 38. He also argued that
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments required a jury of at
least six members in criminal cases. Id., at 38.
The motion for a 12-person jury was overruled, and the trial
went on to its conclusion before the 5-person jury that had
been impaneled. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury
deliberated for 38 minutes and returned a verdict of guilty on
both counts of the accusation. Id., at 205-208. The court
imposed a sentence of one year and a $1,000 fine on each count,
the periods of incarceration to run concurrently and to be suspended upon payment of the fines. Id., at 16-17, 209. After
a subsequent hearing, the court denied an amended motion for
a new trial.'
Petitioner took an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the
State of Georgia. There he argued: First, the evidence was
insufficient. Second, the trial court committed several First
Amendment errors, namely, that the film as a matter of law
was not obscene, and that the jury instructions incorrectly
explained the standard of scienter, the definition of obscenity,
and the scope of community standards. Third, the seizures
of the films were illegal. Fourth, the convictions on both
counts had placed petitioner in double jeopardy because he
had shown only one motion picture. Fifth, the use of the
five-member jury deprived him of his Sixth and Fourteenth
Amendment right to a trial by jury. Id., at 222-224.
6Petitioner, in his amended motion for a new trial, argued that the films
were seized illegally under a defective warrant; that the obscenity statute,
§ 26-2101, violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments; that the double conviction had placed petitioner in double jeopardy,
in violation of the Fifth Amendment and Ga. Code § 2-108 (1975); that
the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts; that the trial court
erroneously excluded the testimony of a defense expert witness; and that
the court's instruction on sciertter improperly shifted the burden of proof
to the defense. Record 19-21.

435 U. S.

The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's contentions. 138
Ga. App. 530,227 S. E. 2d 65 (1976). The court independently
reviewed the film in its entirety and held it to be "hard core
pornography" and "obscene as a matter of constitutional law
and fact." Id., at 532-533, 227 S. E. 2d, at 67-68. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that petitioner possessed the requisite scienter. As manager of the
theater, petitioner had advertised the movie, had sold tickets,
was present when the films were exhibited, had pressed the
button that allowed entrance to the seating area, and had
locked the door after each arrest. This evidence, according to
the court, met the constructive-knowledge standard of § 262101. The court found no errors in the instructions, in the
issuance of the warrants, or in the presence of the two convictions. In its consideration of the five-person-jury issue,
the court noted that Williams v. Florida had not established
a constitutional minimum number of jurors. Absent a holding by this Court that a five-person jury was constitutionally
inadequate, the Court of Appeals considered itself bound by
Sanders v. State, 234 Ga. 586, 216 S. E. 2d 838 (1975), cert.
denied, 424 U. S. 931 (1976), where the constitutionality of
the five-person jury had been upheld. The court also cited
the earlier case of McIntyre v. State, 190 Ga. 872, 11 S. E. 2d
5 (1940), a holding to the same general effect but without
elaboration.
The Supreme Court of Georgia denied certiorari. App. 26.
In his petition for certiorari here, petitioner raised three
issues: the unconstitutionality of the five-person jury; the
constitutional sufficiency of the jury instructions on scienter
and constructive, rather than actual, knowledge of the contents
of the film; and obscenity vel non. We granted certiorari.
429 U. S. 1071 (1977). Because we now hold that the fivemember jury does not satisfy the jury trial guarantee of the
Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth, we do not reach the other issues.

The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees the right of trial
by jury in all state nonpetty criminal cases. Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 159-162 (1968). The Court in
Duncan applied this Sixth Amendment right to the States
because "trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the
American scheme of justice." Id., at 149. The right attaches
in the present case because the maximum penalty for violating
§ 26-2101, as it existed at the time of the alleged offenses,
exceeded six months' imprisonment.7 See Baldwin v. New
York, 399 U. S. 66, 68-69 (1970) (opinion of W Irr, J.).
In Williams v. Florida,399 U. S., at 100, the Court reaffirmed that the "purpose of the jury trial, as we noted in
Duncan, is to prevent oppression by the Government. 'Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his
peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt
or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased,
or eccentric judge.' Duncan v. Louisiana, [391 U. S.,] at
156." See Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410 (1972)
(opinion of WHITr, J.). This purpose is attained by the participation of the community in determinations of guilt and by
the application of the common sense of laymen who, as jurors,
consider the case. Williams v. Florida,399 U. S., at 100.
Williams held that these functions and this purpose could
be fulfilled by a jury of six members. As the Court's opinion
in that case explained at some length, id., at 86-90, commonlaw juries included 12 members by historical accident, "unrelated to the great purposes which gave rise to the jury in the

The maximum penalty for a conviction of a misdemeanor in Georgia
in 1973 was imprisonment for not to exceed 12 months, or a fine not to
exceed $1,000, or both. Ga. Code Ann. § 27-2506 (1972). With the
change in § 26-2101 effected by 1975 Ga. Laws No. 204, p. 498, the offenses
charged against petitioner would now be punishable as for "a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature," and the maximum penalty is
imprisonment for not to exceed 12 months, or a fine not to exceed $5,000,
or both. Ga. Code § 27-2506 (c) (Supp. 1977).

first place." Id., at 89-90. The Court's earlier cases that
had assumed the number 12 to be constitutionally compelled
were set to one side because they had not considered history
and the function of the jury." Id., at 90-92. Rather than
requiring 12 members, then, the Sixth Amendment mandated
a jury only of sufficient size to promote group deliberation, to
insulate members from outside intimidation, and to provide
a representative cross-section of the community. Id., at 100.
Although recognizing that by 1970 little empirical research
had evaluated jury performance, the Court found no evidence
that the reliability of jury verdicts diminished with sixmember panels. Nor did the Court anticipate significant differences in result, including the frequency of "hung" juries.
Id., at 101-102, and nn. 47 and 48. Because the reduction in
size did not threaten exclusion of any particular class from
jury roles, concern that the representative or cross-section
character of the jury would suffer with a decrease to six members seemed "an unrealistic one." Id., at 102. As a consequence, the six-person jury was held not to violate the Sixth
and Fourteenth Amendments.
III
When the Court in Williams permitted the reduction in jury
size-or, to put it another way, when it held that a jury of six
was not unconstitutional-it expressly reserved ruling on the
issue whether a number smaller than six passed constitutional
scrutiny. Id., at 91 n. 28.1 See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406
8

The Court rejected the assumption, made in Thompson v. Utah, 170
U. S. 343, 349 (1898), and certain later cases, see Patton v. United States,
281 U. S. 276, 288 (1930); Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516,
519, 528 (1905); and Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, 586 (1900), that the
12-member feature was a constitutional requirement.
9In the cited footnote the Court said: "We have no occasion in this
case to determine what minimum number can still constitute a 'jury,' but
we do not doubt that six is above that minimum."
Respondent picks up the last phrase with absolute literalness here when

BLACKMUN, J.

U. S. 356, 365-366 (1972) (concurring opinion). The Court
refused to speculate when this so-called "slippery slope"
would become too steep. We face now, however, the twofold question whether a further reduction in the size of the
state criminal trial jury does make the grade too dangerous,
that is, whether it inhibits the functioning of the jury as an
institution to a significant degree, and, if so, whether any
state interest counterbalances and justifies the disruption so
as to preserve its constitutionality.
Williams v. Floridaand Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149
(1973) (where the Court held that a jury of six members did

not violate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in a
civil case), generated a quantity of scholarly work on jury
size." These writings do not draw or identify a bright line
it argues: "If six is above the minimum, five cannot be below the minimum.
There is no number in between." Brief for Respondent 4; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 24. We, however, do not accept the proposition that by stating the
number six was "above" the constitutional minimum the Court, by implication, held that at least the number five was constitutional. Instead, the
Court was holding that six passed constitutional muster but was reserving
judgment on any number less than six.

below which the number of jurors would not be able to function as required by the standards enunciated in Williams. On
the other hand, they raise significant questions about the wisdom and constitutionality of a reduction below six. We
examine these concerns:
First, recent empirical data suggest that progressively
smaller juries are less likely to foster effective group deliberation. At some point, this decline leads to inaccurate factfinding and incorrect application of the common sense of the
community to the facts. Generally, a positive correlation
exists between group size and the quality of both group perinafter cited as Pabst); Saks, Ignorance of Science Is No Excuse, 10 Trial 18

Some of these studies have been pressed upon us by the parties. Brief
for Petitioner 7-9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 26-27.
We have considered them carefully because they provide the only basis,
besides judicial hunch, for a decision about whether smaller and smaller
juries will be able to fulfill the purpose and functions of the Sixth Amendment. Without an examination about how juries and small groups actually
work, we would not understand the basis for the conclusion of MR. JUSTICE
POWELL that "a line has to be drawn somewhere." We also note that THE
CHIEF JUSTICE did not shrink from the use of empirical data in Williams v.
Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 100-102, 105 (1970), when the data were used to
support the constitutionality of the six-person criminal jury, or in Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U. S. 149, 158-160 (1973), a decision also joined by
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST.

formance and group productivity." A variety of explanations
have been offered for this conclusion. Several are particularly
applicable in the jury setting. The smaller the group, the
less likely are members to make critical contributions necessary for the solution of a given problem. 2 Because most juries
are not permitted to take notes, see Forston, Sense and NonSense: Jury Trial Communication, 1975 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 601,
631-633, memory is important for accurate jury deliberations. As juries decrease in size, then, they are less likely to
have members who remember each of the important pieces
of evidence or argument. 3 Furthermore, the smaller the
group, the less likely it is to overcome the biases of its members to obtain an accurate result. 4 When individual and
group decisionmaking were compared, it was seen that groups
performed better because prejudices of individuals were frequently counterbalanced, and objectivity resulted. Groups
also exhibited increased motivation and self-criticism. All
these advantages, except, perhaps, self-motivation, tend to
diminish as the size of the group diminishes.' 5 Because juries
frequently face complex problems laden with value choices,
the benefits are important and should be retained. In par11 Two researchers have summarized the findings of 31 studies in which
the size of groups from 2 to 20 members was an important variable.

They concluded that there were no conditions under which smaller groups
were superior in the quality of group performance and group productivity.

ticular, the counterbalancing of various biases is critical to
the accurate application of the common sense of the community to the facts of any given case.
Second, the data now raise doubts about the accuracy of the
results achieved by smaller and smaller panels. Statistical
studies suggest that the risk of convicting an innocent person
(Type I error) rises as the size of the jury diminishes.' 6
Because the risk of not convicting a guilty person (Type II
error) increases with the size of the panel,' an optimal jury
size can be selected as a function of the interaction between
the two risks. Nagel and Neef concluded that the optimal
size, for the purpose of minimizing errors, should vary with
the importance attached to the two types of mistakes. After
weighting Type I error as 10 times more significant than
Type II, perhaps not an unreasonable assumption, they concluded that the optimal jury size was between six and eight.
As the size diminished to five and below, the weighted sum of
errors increased because of 8the enlarging risk of the conviction of innocent defendants.
Another doubt about progressively smaller juries arises from
the increasing inconsistency that results from the decreases.
Saks argued that the "more a jury type fosters consistency,
the greater will be the proportion of juries which select the
correct (i. e., the same) verdict and the fewer 'errors' will be
made." Saks 86-87. From his mock trials held before undergraduates and former jurors, he computed the percentage of
"correct" decisions rendered by 12-person and 6-person panels.
In the student experiment, 12-person groups reached correct

Nagel & Neef 945.

Id., at 946-948, 956, 975. Friedman reached a similar conclusion.
He varied the appearance of guilt in his statistical study. The more guilty
the person appeared, the greater the chance that a 6-member panel would
convict when a 12-member panel would not. As jury size was reduced,
the risk of Type I error would increase, Friedman said, without a significant corresponding advantage in reducing Type II error. Friedman 23.

verdicts 83% of the time; 6-person panels reached correct
verdicts 69% of the time. The results for the former-juror
study were 71% for the 12-person groups and 57% for the 6person groups. Ibid. Working with statistics described in
H. Kalven & H. Zeisel, The American Jury 460 (1966), Nagel
and Neef tested the average conviction propensity of juries,
that is, the likelihood that any given jury of a set would
convict the defendant."9 They found that half of all 12person juries would have average conviction propensities that
varied by no more than 20 points. Half of all six-person juries,
on the other hand, had average conviction propensities varying by 30 points, a difference they found significant in both
real and percentage terms."0 Lempert reached similar results
when he considered the likelihood of juries to compromise
over the various views of their members, an important phenomenon for the fulfillment of the commonsense function.
In civil trials averaging occurs with respect to damages
amounts. In criminal trials it relates to numbers of counts
and lesser included offenses." And he predicted that compromises would be more consistent when larger juries were
employed. For example, 12-person juries could be expected
to reach extreme compromises in 4% of the cases, while 6person panels would reach extreme results in 16%.2' All
three of these post-Williams studies, therefore, raise significant doubts about the consistency and reliability of the decisions of smaller juries.
19 Nagel & Neef 952, 971, concluded that the average juror had a
propensity to convict more frequently than to acquit, a tendency designated by the figure .677. In other words, if the average jury considered
the average case, 67.7% of the jurors would vote to convict.
20 With the average juror having a conviction propensity of .677, the
average 12-member jury propensities ranged from .579 to .775. The
average six-member jury propensities ranged from .530 to .830. Id., at
971-972.

Third, the data suggest that the verdicts of jury deliberation in criminal cases will vary as juries become smaller, and
that the variance amounts to an imbalance to the detriment
of one side, the defense. Both Lempert and Zeisel found that
the number of hung juries would diminish as the panels
decreased in size. Zeisel said that the number would be cut
in half-from 5% to 2.4% with a decrease from 12 to 6
members. 23 Both studies emphasized that juries in criminal
cases generally hang with only one, or more likely two, jurors
remaining unconvinced of guilt."' Also, group theory suggests
that a person in the minority will adhere to his position more
frequently when he has at least one other person supporting
his argument.2 5 In the jury setting the significance of this
tendency is demonstrated by the following figures: If a minority viewpoint is shared by 10% of the community, 28.2% of
12-member juries may be expected to have no minority representation, but 53.1% of 6-member juries would have none.
Thirty-four percent of 12-member panels could be expected to
have two minority members, while only 11% of 6-member
panels would have two.2 6 As the numbers diminish below
six, even fewer panels would have one member with the minority viewpoint and still fewer would have two. The chance
for hung juries would decline accordingly.
Fourth, what has just been said about the presence of
minority viewpoint as juries decrease in size foretells problems not only for jury decisionmaking, but also for the representation of minority groups in the community. The Court
repeatedly has held that meaningful community participation
cannot be attained with the exclusion of minorities or other

identifiable groups from jury service. "It is part of the established tradition in the use of juries as instruments of public
justice that the jury be a body truly representative of the community." Smith v. Texas, 311 U. S. 128, 130 (1940). The
exclusion of elements of the community from participation
"contravenes the very idea of a jury . . .composed of 'the
peers or equals of the person whose rights it is selected or
summoned to determine.'"
Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396
U. S. 320, 330 (1970), quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100
U. S. 303, 308 (1880). Although the Court in Williams concluded that the six-person jury did not fail to represent adequately a cross-section of the community, the opportunity for
meaningful and appropriate representation does decrease with
the size of the panels. Thus, if a minority group constitutes
10% of the community, 53.1% of randomly selected sixmember juries could be expected to have no minority representative among their members, and 89% not to have two.27
Further reduction in size will erect additional barriers to
representation.
Fifth,' several authors have identified in jury research
methodological problems tending to mask differences in the
operation of smaller and larger juries.2 8 For example,
because the judicial system handles so many clear cases,
decisionmakers will reach similar results through similar
analyses most of the time. One study concluded that smaller
and larger juries could disagree in their verdicts in no more
than 14% of the cases.29 Disparities, therefore, appear in
only small percentages. Nationwide, however, these small
percentages will represent a large number of cases. And it is
with respect to those cases that the jury trial right has its

greatest value. When the case is close, and the guilt or innocence of the defendant is not readily apparent, a properly functioning jury system will insure evaluation by the sense of the
community and will also tend to insure accurate factfinding.3 0
Studies that aggregate data also risk masking case-by-case
differences in jury deliberations. The authors, H. Kalven and
H. Zeisel, of The American Jury (1966), examined the judgejury disagreement. They found that judges held for plaintiffs 57% of the time and that juries held for plaintiffs 59%,
an insignificant difference. Yet case-by-case comparison revealed judge-jury disagreement in 22% of the cases. Id., at
63, cited in Lempert 656. This casts doubt on the conclusion of another study that compared the aggregate results of
civil cases tried before 6-member juries with those of 12member jury trials." The investigator in that study had
claimed support for his hypothesis that damages awards did
30 Zeisel and Diamond have criticized one of the more important studies
supporting smaller juries. See n. 34, infra. In Note, An Empirical Study
of Six- and Twelve-Member Jury Decision-Making Processes, 6 U. Mich.
J. L. Reform 712 (1973), the author tested the deliberations of larger and
smaller panels by showing to sets of both sizes the video tape of a single

mock civil trial. The case concerned an automobile accident and turned
on whether the plaintiff had been speeding. If so, Michigan law precluded
recovery because of contributory negligence. Of the 16 juries tested,
not one found for the plaintiff. This led Zeisel and Diamond to conclude:
"The evidence in the case overwhelmingly favored the defendant ....
This overpowering bias makes the experiment irrelevant. On the facts of
this case, any jury under any rules would probably have arrived at the
same verdict. Hence, to conclude from this experiment that jury size
generally has no effect on the verdict is impermissible." Zeisel & Diamond
287.

not vary with the reduction in jury size. Although some
might say that figures in the aggregate may have supported
this conclusion, a closer view of the cases reveals greater variation in the results of the smaller panels, i. e., a standard deviation of $58,335 for the 6-member juries, and of $24,834 for
the 12-member juries.2 Again, the averages masked significant case-by-case differences that must be considered when
evaluating jury function and performance.
IV
While we adhere to, and reaffirm our holding in Williams v.
Florida, these studies, most of which have been made since
Williams was decided in 1970, lead us to conclude that the
purpose and functioning of the jury in a criminal trial is
seriously impaired, and to a constitutional degree, by a reduction in size to below six members. We readily admit that we
do not pretend to discern a clear line between six members
and five. But the assembled data raise substantial doubt
about the reliability and appropriate representation of panels
smaller than six. Because of the fundamental importance of
the jury trial to the American system of criminal justice, any
further reduction that promotes inaccurate and possibly biased
decisionmaking, that causes untoward differences in verdicts,
and that prevents juries from truly representing their communities, attains constitutional significance.
Georgia here presents no persuasive argument that a reduction to five does not offend important Sixth Amendment interests. First, its reliance on Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S.
356 (1972), for the proposition that the Court previously has
approved the five-person jury is misplaced. In Johnson the
32 Zeisel & Diamond 289-290. These authors also criticized the Michigan
study because it ignored two other important changes that had occurred
when the size of civil juries was decreased from 12 to 6 members: A
mediation board, which encouraged settlements, had been introduced, and
rules that permitted discovery of insurance policy limits had taken effect.

See Saks 43.

petitioner challenged the Louisiana statute that permitted
felony convictions on less-than-unanimous verdicts. The
prosecution had to garner only nine votes of the 12-member
jury to convict in a felony trial. The Court held that the
statute did not violate the due process guarantee by diluting
the reasonable-doubt standard. Id., at 363. The only discussion of the five-person panels, which heard less serious
offenses, was with respect to the petitioner's equal protection
challenge. He contended that requiring only nine members
of a 12-person panel to convict in a felony case was a deprival
of equal protection when a unanimous verdict was required
from the 5-member panel used in a misdemeanor trial. The
Court held merely that the classification was not invidious.
Id., at 364. Because the issue of the constitutionality of the
five-member jury was not then before the Court, it did not
rule upon it.
Second, Georgia argues that its use of five-member juries
does not violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
because they are used only in misdemeanor cases. If six
persons may constitutionally assess the felony charge in
Williams, the State reasons, five persons should be a constitutionally adequate number for a misdemeanor trial. The
problem with this argument is that the purpose and functions
of the jury do not vary significantly with the importance of
the crime. In Baldwin v. New York, 399 U. S. 66 (1970),
the Court held that the right to a jury trial attached in both
felony and misdemeanor cases. Only in cases concerning
truly petty crimes, where the deprivation of liberty was minimal, did the defendant have no constitutional right to trial by
jury. In the present case the possible deprivation of liberty
is substantial. The State charged petitioner with misdemeanors under Ga. Code Ann. § 26-2101 (1972), and he has
been given concurrent sentences of imprisonment, each for
one year, and fines totaling $2,000 have been imposed. We
cannot conclude that there is less need for the imposition and

the direction of the sense of the community in this case
than when the State has chosen to label an offense a felony."
The need for an effective jury here must be judged by the
same standards announced and applied in Williams v. Florida.
Third, the retention by Georgia of the unanimity requirement does not solve the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment
problem. Our concern has to do with the ability of the
smaller group to perform the functions mandated by the
Amendments. That a five-person jury may return a unanimous decision does not speak to the questions whether the
group engaged in meaningful deliberation, could remember all
the important facts and arguments, and truly represented the
sense of the entire community. Despite the presence of the
unanimity requirement, then, we cannot conclude that "the
interest of the defendant in having the judgment of his peers
interposed between himself and the officers of the State who
prosecute and judge him is equally well served" by the fiveperson panel. Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S., at 411 (opinion
of WaIE, J.).
Fourth, Georgia submits that the five-person jury adequately represents the community because there is no arbitrary exclusion of any particular class. We agree that it has
not been demonstrated that the Georgia system violates the
Equal Protection Clause by discriminating on the basis of race
or some other improper classification. See Carter v. Jury
33

We do not rely on any First Amendment aspect of this case in holding
the five-person jury unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the nature of the
substance of the misdemeanor charges against petitioner supports the

refusal to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors. The application

of the community's standards and common sense is important in obscenity
trials where juries must define and apply local standards. See Miller v.
Cdlifornia, 413 U. S. 15 (1973). The opportunity for harassment and
overreaching by an overzealous prosecutor or a biased judge is at least as
significant in an obscenity trial as in one concerning an armed robbery.
This fact does not change merely because the obscenity charge may be
labeled a misdemeanor and the robbery a felony.

435 U. S.

Comm'n, 396 U. S. 320 (1970); Smith v. Texas, 311 I. S.
128 (1940). But the data outlined above raise substantial
doubt about the ability of juries truly to represent the community as membership decreases below six. If the smaller
and smaller juries will lack consistency, as the cited studies
suggest, then the sense of the community will not be applied
equally in like cases. Not only is the representation of
racial minorities threatened in such circumstances, but also
majority attitude or various minority positions may be miscontrued or misapplied by the smaller groups. Even though
the facts of this case would not establish a jury discrimination
claim under the Equal Protection Clause, the question of
representation does constitute one factor of several that, when
combined, create a problem of constitutional significance
under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
Fifth, the empirical data cited by Georgia do not relieve
our doubts. The State relies on the Saks study for the proposition that a decline in the number of jurors will not affect
the aggregate number of convictions or hung juries. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 27. This conclusion, however, is only one of several
in the Saks study; that study eventually concludes:
"Larger juries (size twelve) are preferable to smaller
juries (six). They produce longer deliberations, more
communication, far better community representation,
and, possibly, greater verdict reliability (consistency)."
Saks 107.
Far from relieving our concerns, then, the Saks study supports the conclusion that further reduction in jury size threatens Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment interests.
Methodological problems prevent reliance on the three
studies that do purport to bolster Georgia's position. The
reliability of the two Michigan studies cited by the State has
been criticized elsewhere. 4 The critical problem with the

Michigan laboratory experiment, which used a mock civil trial,
was the apparent clarity of the case. Not one of the juries
found for the plaintiff in the tort suit; this masked any potential difference in the decisionmaking of larger and smaller
panels. The results also have been doubted because in the
experiment only students composed the juries, only 16 juries
were tested, and only a video tape of the mock trial was presented.3" The statistical review of the results of actual jury
trials in Michigan erroneously aggregated outcomes. It is

also said that it failed to take account of important changes

of court procedure initiated at the time of the reduction in
size from 12 to 6 members.3 6

The Davis study, which

employed a mock criminal trial for rape, also presented an
extreme set of facts so that none of the panels rendered a
guilty verdict." None of thege three reports, therefore, convinces us that a reduction in the number of jurors below six
will not affect to a constitutional degree the functioning of
juries in criminal trials.
V
With the reduction in the number of jurors below six creating a substantial threat to Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment
guarantees, we must consider whether any interest of the State
justifies the reduction. We find no significant state advantage
in reducing the number of jurors from six to five.
The States utilize juries of less than 12 primarily for administrative reasons. Savings in court time and in financial costs

are claimed to justify the reductions."
The financial benefits
of the reduction from 12 to 6 are substantial; this is mainly
because fewer jurors draw daily allowances as they hear cases."
On the other hand, the asserted saving in judicial time is not
so clear. Pabst in his study found little reduction in the time
for voir dire with the six-person jury because many questions
were directed at the veniremen as a group.40 Total trial time
did not diminish, and court delays and backlogs improved very
little.4
The point that is to be made, of course, is that a
reduction in size from six to five or four or even three would
save the States little. They could reduce slightly the daily
allowances, but with a reduction from six to five the saving
would be minimal. If little time is gained by the reduction
from 12 to 6, less will be gained with a reduction from 6 to
5. Perhaps this explains why only two States, Georgia and
Virginia,4 2 have reduced the size of juries in certain nonpetty
criminal cases to five. Other States appear content with six
members or more.43 In short, the State has offered little or
no justification for its reduction to five members.
