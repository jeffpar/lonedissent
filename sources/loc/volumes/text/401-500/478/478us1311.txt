PRUDENTIAL FEDERAL S. & L. ASSN. v. FLANIGAN

1311

Opinion in Chambers

PRUDENTIAL FEDERAL SAVINGS & LOAN ASSOCIATION v. FLANIGAN
ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION
No. A-229.

Decided September 25, 1986

An application for an injunction pending appeal is denied because the
constitutional issues raised were not presented to the Montana Supreme
Court until applicants filed for a rehearing, which was denied without
comment, consistent with that court's practice of refusing to consider
issues not pressed at every stage of litigation.

Circuit Justice.
The application for a writ of injunction pending appeal is
denied. The constitutional issues addressed in the application were not properly presented to the Montana Supreme
Court until the applicants filed for rehearing. The court denied the petition for rehearing without comment, consistent
with its practice of refusing to consider issues not pressed at
each stage of the litigation. See Femling v. Montana State
University, Mont. , 713 P. 2d 996, 999 (1986); Dodd
v. East Helena, 180 Mont. 518, 523, 591 P. 2d 241, 244 (1979).
Under these circumstances, the claims presented by the applicants are not properly before me. "Questions first presented to the highest State court on a petition for rehearing
JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

come too late for consideration here .
