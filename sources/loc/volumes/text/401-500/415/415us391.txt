ADMINISTRATION

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 72-700.

Argued December 11, 1973-Decided March 4, .974

Petitioners, who were denied educational benefits under the Veterans'
Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966 because, as conscientious objectors exempt from the military service who performed alterna.tive
civilian service, they were ineligible for such benefits,' broight
actions challenging the constitutionality, on First and Fifth
Amendment grounds, of the provisions of the Act making them
ineligible. The District Court dismissed the actions on the
grounds that jurisdiction was barred by 38 U. S. C. § 211 (a) and
petitioners' constitutional claims were insubstantial and -without
merit. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of the jurisdictional bar. Held:- Section 211 (a) does not bar judicial consideration of constitutional challenges to veterans' benefits
legislation. Johnson v. Robison, ante, p. 361. P. 393.
467 F. 2d 479, vacated and remanded.

jectors who, upon completion of alternative civilian service pursuant to § 6 (j) of the Military Selective Service
Act, 50 U. S. C. App. § 456 (j), and the governing regulations of the Selective Service System, 32 CFR, Part 1660,
applied for educational benefits provided by the Veterans'
Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966. The Veterans' Administration denied petitioners' application for the reasons upon which appellee Robison's request was denied,
i. e., because a Class .- 0 conscientious objector who has
performed alternative civilian service does not qualify
under 38 U. S. C. § 1652 (a) (1) as a "veteran who ...
served on active duty" (defined in 38 U. S. C. § 101 (21)
as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces"), and is therefore not an "eligible veteran" entitled under 38 U. S. C.§ 1661 (a) to veterans' educational benefits provided by
the Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966.
Alleging that those sections. of the 1966 Act discriminate against conscientious objectors in violation of the
Fifth Amendment, and infringe the Religion Clauses of
the First Amendment, petitioners filed two actions seeking declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief and requesting the convening of a three-judge district court.
The District Court consolidated the two cases and granted
the Government's motion to dismiss on the grounds that
'plaintiffs' requests for affirmative relief are not within
the jurisdiction of this Court due to the mandate of 38
U. S. C. § 211 (a) . ... [and] the plaintiffs' challenge ...
based on alleged violations of the Fifth and First Amendments to the United States Constitution are [sic] insubstantial and without merit." 339 F. Supp. 913, 916 (ND
Cal. 1972). Notwithstanding the District Court's dismissal of petitioners' constitutional claims on the ground
of insubstantiality, the Court of Appeals, as we read that
court's opinion, construed the order of dismissal as based
solely upon the jurisdictional bar of § 211 (a), and af-

Opinion of the Court

firmed the District Court on that ground. 467 F. 2d 479
(1972).
We granted certiorari and set the case for oral
argument with Johnson v. Robison, ante, -P. 361. 411
U. S. 981 (1973).
We have held today in Johnson v. Robison that
§ 211 (a) does not bar judicial consideration of constitutional challenges to veterans' benefits legislation. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings
consistent with our opinion in Johnson v. Robison.
It is so ordered.
Mit. JUSTICE DOUGLAS concurs in the result for the
reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in Johnson v.
Robison, ante, p. 386.
