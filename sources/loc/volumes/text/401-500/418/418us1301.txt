(LEWIS, APPLICANT)
ON APPLICATION

FOR STAY OF EXECUTION
PENDING APPEAL

AND/OR BAIL

No. A-1268. Decided July 4, 1974
Applicant newsman, with no criminal record, who had given FBI
copies of tapes and documents delivered to him by an underground
group but whoim District Court held in contempt for refusing to
deliver originals, is released on personal recognizance pending
Court of Appeals' decision on the merits.

MR.

JUSTICE

DOUGLAS, Circuit Justice.

Applicant asks for release on bail or a stay of the
execution of the District Court's order committing him
for contempt pending decision of his case on the merits
by the Court of Appeals. He had given the FBI copies
of certain tapes and documents delivered to him by an
underground group but refused to deliver the originals.
So far as I am advised, he was held in contempt for that
refusal. Substantial First Amendment claims are raised
under the majority ruling in Branzburg v. Hayes, 408
U. S. 665, as evident from Gibson v. FloridaLegislative
Investigation Committee, 372 U. S. 539, 546. I indicate
no view on the merits. But since the applicant is a newsman entitled to all First Amendment protections and has
no criminal record, I have entered an order releasing him
on his personal recognizance, pending decision of his
appeal by the Court of Appeals.
