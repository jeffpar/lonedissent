v. CURRAN ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 80-203.

Argued November 2, 1981-Decided May 3, 1982*

The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which regulates commodity futures
trading, was substantially amended by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission Act of 1974. Among other things, the Commodity Futures
Exchange Commission was created to assume the regulatory and enforcement powers previously exercised by the Secretary of Agriculture
and certain additional powers, and that Commission was authorized to
grant reparations to any person complaining of a violation of the CEA or
its implementing regulations committed by any futures commission merchant, floor broker, commodity trading adviser, or commodity pool operator. But the 1974 Act, like the original legislation and other amendatory enactments, was silent on the subject of private judicial remedies
for persons injured by a violation of the CEA. These cases involve an
action by an investor in commodity futures contracts against his futures
commission merchant or broker for violation of an antifraud provision of
the CEA, and three actions by speculators in futures contracts against
the New York Mercantile Exchange and its officials and against futures
commission merchants, claiming damages resulting from unlawful price
manipulation that allegedly could have been prevented by the Exchange's enforcement of its own rules. In each action, after the respective District Courts had ruled adversely to the plaintiffs, the respective
Courts of Appeals held that the plaintiffs had implied rights of action
under the CEA.
Held: A private party may maintain an action for damages caused by a violation of the CEA. Pp. 374-395.
(a) Where it is clear that an implied cause of action under the CEA
was a part of the "contemporary legal context" in which Congress undertook a comprehensive reexamination and amendment of the CEA in
1974, the fact that the amendments left intact the provisions under which

the federal courts had implied a cause of action is itself evidence that
Congress affirmatively intended to preserve that remedy. Pp. 374-382.
(b) Moreover, a review of the legislative history of the 1974 enactment
indicates that preservation of the remedy was indeed what Congress intended. Pp. 382-388.
(c) Purchasers and sellers of futures contracts have standing to assert
both types of claims involved here-violation of the statutory prohibition
against fraudulent and deceptive conduct and of the provisions designed
to prevent price manipulation. The legislative history clearly indicates
that Congress intended to protect all futures traders from price manipulation and other fraudulent conduct violative of the statute. Since actions by investors against exchanges were part of the contemporary
legal context that Congress intended to preserve, exchanges can be held
accountable for breaching their statutory duties to enforce their own
rules prohibiting price manipulation. It follows that those persons who
are participants in a conspiracy to manipulate the market in violation of
those rules are also subject to suit by futures traders who can prove injury from such violations. Pp. 388-395.

Opinion of the Court

I
Prior to the advent of futures trading, agricultural products generally were sold at central markets. When an entire
crop was harvested and marketed within a short timespan,
dramatic price fluctuations sometimes created severe hardship for farmers or for processors. Some of these risks were
alleviated by the adoption of quality standards, improvements in storage and transportation facilities, and the practice of "forward contracting"-the use of executory contracts
fixing the terms of sale in advance of the time of delivery.7
When buyers and sellers entered into contracts for the future delivery of an agricultural product, they arrived at an
agreed price on the basis of their judgment about expected
market conditions at the time of delivery. Because the
weather and other imponderables affected supply and demand, normally the market price would fluctuate before the
contract was performed. A declining market meant that the
executory agreement was more valuable to the seller than
the commodity covered by the contract; conversely, in a rising market the executory contract had a special value for the
buyer, who not only was assured of delivery of the commodity but also could derive a profit from the price increase.
The opportunity to make a profit as a result of fluctuations
in the market price of commodities covered by contracts for
future delivery motivated speculators to engage in the practice of buying and selling "futures contracts." A speculator
who owned no present interest in a commodity but anticipated a price decline might agree to a future sale at the current market price, intending to purchase the commodity at a
reduced price on or before the delivery date. A "short" sale
of that kind would result in a loss if the price went up instead
of down. On the other hand, a price increase would produce
a gain for a "long" speculator who had acquired a contract to

purchase the same commodity with no intent to take delivery
but merely for the purpose of reselling the futures contract at
an enhanced price.
In the 19th century the practice of trading in futures contracts led to the development of recognized exchanges or
boards of trade. At such exchanges standardized agreements covering specific quantities of graded agricultural commodities to be delivered during specified months in the future
were bought and sold pursuant to rules developed by the
traders themselves. Necessarily the commodities subject to
such contracts were fungible. For an active market in the
contracts to develop, it also was essential that the contracts
themselves be fungible. The exchanges therefore developed
standard terms describing the quantity and quality of the
commodity, the time and place of delivery, and the method of
payment; the only variable was price. The purchase or sale
of a futures contract on an exchange is therefore motivated
by a single factor-the opportunity to make a profit (or to
minimize the risk of loss) from a change in the market price.
The advent of speculation in futures markets produced
well-recognized benefits for producers and processors of agricultural commodities. A farmer who takes a "short" position
in the futures market is protected against a price decline; a
processor who takes a "long" position is protected against a
price increase. Such "hedging" is facilitated by the availability of speculators willing to assume the market risk that the
hedging farmer or processor wants to avoid. The speculators' participation in the market substantially enlarges the
number of potential buyers and sellers of executory contracts
and therefore makes it easier for farmers and processors to
make firm commitments for future delivery at a fixed price.
The liquidity of a futures contract, upon which hedging depends, is directly related to the amount of speculation that
takes place.,
'See n. 11, infra. The ability of producers and processors to hedge
against risks of price changes is only one of the advantages of futures trad-

Opinion of the Court

Persons who actually produce or use the commodities that
are covered by futures contracts are not the only beneficiaries of futures trading. The speculators, of course, have
opportunities to profit from this trading. Moreover, futures
trading must be regulated by an organized exchange. In addition to its regulatory responsibilities, the exchange must
maintain detailed records and perform a clearing function
to discharge the offsetting contracts that the short or long
speculators have no desire to perform.9 The operation of
the exchange creates employment opportunities for futures
commission merchants, who solicit orders from individual
traders, and for floor brokers, who make the actual trades on
the floor of the exchange on behalf of futures commission
merchants and their customers. The earnings of the persons
who operate the futures market-the exchange itself, the
clearinghouse, the floor brokers, and the futures commission
merchants-are financed by commissions on the purchase
and sale of futures contracts made over the exchange.
Thus, in a broad sense, futures trading has a direct financial impact on three classes of persons. Those who actually
are interested in selling or buying the commodity are described as "hedgers"; 1 their primary financial interest is in
the profit to be earned from the production or processing of
the commodity. Those who seek financial gain by taking positions in the futures market generally are called "speculators" or "investors"; without their participation, futures marFinally, there are the

ing. Other advantages are described at some length in the House Report,
at 132-134.
"The House Report, at 149, states that only about "3% of all futures contracts traded are normally settled by an actual delivery."
' Of course, when a hedger takes a long or a short position that is greater
than its interest in the commodity itself, it is to that extent no longer a
hedger, but a speculator.
""Broadly speaking, futures traders fall into two general classifications,
i. e. 'trade' hedging customers, and speculators. All orders which reach

futures commission merchants, the floor brokers, and the
persons who manage the market; they also are essential participants, and they have an interest in maximizing the activity on the exchange. The petitioners in these cases are
members of this third class whereas their adversaries, the respondents, are speculators or investors.
II
Because Congress has recognized the potential hazards as
well as the benefits of futures trading, it has authorized the
regulation of commodity futures exchanges for over 60 years.
In 1921 it enacted the Future Trading Act, 42 Stat. 187,
which imposed a prohibitive tax on grain 2 futures transactions that were not consummated on an exchange designated
the trading floor originate with one or the other group of traders. The
'trade' customer is the hedger who seeks, at low cost, to protect himself or
his company against possible loss due to adverse price fluctuations in the
market place. Speculators, on the other hand, embrace all representatives of the general public, including some institutions, plus floor scalpers
and position traders, who seek financial gain by taking positions in volatile
markets. The principal role of the speculator in the markets is to take the
risks that the hedger is unwilling to accept. The opportunity for profit
makes the speculator willing to take those risks. The activity of speculators is essential to the operation of a futures market in that the composite
bids and offers of large numbers of individuals tend to broaden a market,
thus making possible the execution with minimum price disturbance of the
larger trade hedging orders. By increasing the number of bids and offers
available at any given price level, the speculator usually helps to minimize
price fluctuations rather than to intensify them. Without the trading activity of the speculative fraternity, the liquidity, so badly needed in futures
markets, simply would not exist. Trading volume would be restricted materially since, without a host of speculative orders in the trading ring,
many larger trade orders at limit prices would simply go unfilled due to the
floor broker's inability to find an equally large but opposing hedge order at
the same price to complete the match." Id., at 138.

as a "contract market" by the Secretary of Agriculture."
The 1921 statute was held unconstitutional as an improper
exercise of the taxing power in Hill v. Wallace, 259 U. S. 44
(1922), but its regulatory provisions were promptly reenacted in the Grain Futures Act, 42 Stat. 998, and upheld
under the commerce power in Chicago Board of Trade v.
Olsen, 262 U. S. 1 (1923). 1 Under the original legislation,
the principal function of the Secretary was to require the
governors of a privately organized exchange to supervise the
operation of the market. Two of the conditions for designation were that the governing board of the contract market
prevent its members from disseminating misleading market
information 5 and prevent the "manipulation of prices or the
cornering of any grain by the dealers or operators upon such
board."' 6 The requirement that designated contract mar""It was an effort by Congress, through taxing at a prohibitive rate
sales of grain for future delivery, to regulate such sales on boards of trade

(1923).
" The Grain Futures Act which is now before us differs from the Future
Trading Act in having the very features the absence of which we held...
prevented our sustaining the Future Trading Act. [Tihe act only purports
to regulate interstate commerce and sales of grain for future delivery on
boards of trade because it finds that by manipulation they have become a
constantly recurring burden and obstruction to that commerce." Id., at
32.
Congress replaced the prohibitive tax on futures trading not conducted
on a designated contract market with a direct prohibition of such trading.

trading limits. The 1974 amendments, however, did make
substantial changes in the statutory scheme; Congress authorized a newly created Commodities Futures Trading
Commission to assume the powers previously exercised by
the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as certain additional
powers. The enactment also added two new remedial provisions for the protection of individual traders. The newly enacted ยง 5a(11) required every contract market to provide an
arbitration procedure for the settlement of traders' claims of
no more than $15,000.1 And the newly enacted ยง 14 authorized the Commission to grant reparations to any person complaining of any violation of the CEA, or its implementing
regulations, committed by any futures commission merchant
or any associate thereof, floor broker, commodity trading adviser, or commodity pool operator. 6 This section authorized
the Commission to investigate complaints and, "if in its opinion the facts warrant such action," to afford a hearing before
an administrative law judge. Reparations orders entered by
the Commission are subject to judicial review.

In the four cases before us, the allegations in the complaints filed by respondents are assumed to be true. The

first involves a complaint by customers against their broker.
The other three arise out of a malfunction of the contract
market for futures contracts covering the delivery of Maine
potatoes in May 1976, "'when the sellers of almost 1,000 contracts failed to deliver approximately 50,000,000 pounds of
potatoes, resulting in the largest default in the history of

commodities futures trading in this country."' 39

No. 80-203
Respondents in No. 80-203 were customers of petitioner, a
futures commission merchant registered with the Commission. In 1973, they authorized petitioner to trade in commodity futures on their behalf and deposited $100,000 with
petitioner to finance such trading. The trading initially was
profitable, but substantial losses subsequently were suffered
and the account ultimately was closed.
In 1976, the respondents commenced this action in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan. They alleged that petitioner had mismanaged the
account, had made material misrepresentations in connection
with the opening and the management of the account, had
made a large number of trades for the sole purpose of generating commissions, and had refused to follow their instructions. Respondents claimed that petitioner had violated the
CEA, the federal securities laws, and state statutory and
common law.
The District Court dismissed the claims under the federal
securities laws and stayed other proceedings pending arbitration. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 80-203, pp. A-39 to

no issue concerning the continuing validity of the implied
right of action was raised in the court below, nor in this
appeal. Nevertheless, to provide direction to the district court upon remand and to avoid further delay in this
already protracted litigation, we review this issue and
specifically agree that an implied private right of action

One of the futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange provided for the delivery of a railroad car
lot of 50,000 pounds of Maine potatoes at a designated place
on the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad during the period between May 7, 1976, and May 25, 1976. Trading in this contract commenced early in 1975 and terminated on May 7,
1976. On two occasions during this trading period the Department of Agriculture issued reports containing estimates
that total potato stocks, and particularly Maine potato stocks,
were substantially down from the previous year. This in" 2Although the complaint alleged a violation of ยง 6 of the CEA, the

formation had the understandable consequences of inducing
investors to purchase May Maine potato futures contracts (on
the expectation that they would profit from a shortage of potatoes in May) and farmers to demand a higher price for their
potatoes on the cash market."
To counteract the anticipated price increases, a group of
entrepreneurs described in the complaints as the "short sellers" formed a conspiracy to depress the price of the May
Maine potato futures contract. The principal participants in
this "short conspiracy" were large processors of potatoes who
then were negotiating with a large potato growers association on the cash market. The conspirators agreed to accumulate an abnormally large short position in the May contract, to make no offsetting purchases of long contracts at a
price in excess of a fixed maximum, and to default, if necessary, on their short commitments. They also agreed to flood
the Maine cash markets with unsold potatoes. This multifaceted strategy was designed to give the growers association
the impression that the supply of Maine potatoes would be
plentiful. On the final trading day the short sellers had accumulated a net short position of almost 1,900 contracts, notwithstanding a Commission regulation44 limiting their lawful
net position to 150 contracts. They did, in fact, default.
The trading limit also was violated by a separate group described as the "long conspirators." Aware of the short conspiracy, they determined that they not only could counteract
its effects but also could enhance the price the short conspirators would have to pay to liquidate their short positions by
accumulating an abnormally large long position-at the close
of trading they controlled 911 long contracts-and by creatAs a result of the first report issued in August 1975, "the price of the

ing an artificial shortage of railroad cars during the contract
delivery period. Because the long conspirators were successful in tying up railroad cars, they prevented the owners
of warehoused potatoes from making deliveries to persons
desiring to perform short contracts."
Respondents are speculators who invested long in Maine
futures contracts.46 Allegedly, if there had been no price
manipulation, they would have earned a significant profit by
reason of the price increase that free market forces would
have produced.
Petitioners in No. 80-757 are the New York Mercantile
Exchange and its officials. Respondents' complaints alleged
that the Exchange knew, or should have known, of both the
short and the long conspiracies but failed to perform its statutory duties to report these violations to the Commission and
to prevent manipulation of the contract market. The Exchange allegedly had the authority under its rules to declare
an emergency, to require the shorts and the longs to participate in an orderly liquidation, and to authorize truck deliveries and other measures that would have prevented or mitigated the consequences of the massive defaults.
Petitioners in No. 80-895 and No. 80-936 are the firms of
futures commission merchants that the short conspirators
used to accumulate their net short position. The complaint
alleged that petitioners knowingly participated in the conspiracy to accumulate the net short position, and in doing so
violated position and trading limits imposed by the Commission and Exchange rules requiring liquidation of contracts
"'"Because the long conspirators had successfully tied up all the freight
cars of the Bangor & Aroostook, Incomco was unable to deliver its
warehoused potatoes to persons seeking delivery to fulfill short contracts.

that obviously could not be performed. " Moreover, the
complaint alleged that petitioners violated their statutory
duty to report violations of the CEA to the Commission.
In late 1976, three separate actions were filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York.4 After extensive discovery, the District Court
ruled on various motions, all of which challenged the plaintiffs' right to recover damages under the CEA.49 The District Court considered it beyond question that the plaintiffs
were within the class for whose special benefit the statute
had been enacted,1ยฐ but it concluded that Congress did not in47

Exchange Rule 44.02, governing the final day of trading, provides in
part:
"(a) On the final day of trading in the delivery month, it shall be the
responsibility of each clearinghouse member who is not in a position to fulfill his contractual obligation on any maturing contract by prescribed notice
and tender, to have a liquidating order entered on the Exchange floor not
later than five minutes before the time established as the official close for
such delivery month. All such orders shall be market orders to be executed prior to the expiration of trading."
' The Commission had previously commenced its own investigation,
which led to administrative proceedings against various parties involved in
the default on the May Maine potatoes futures contract. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 80-936, p. 3. Substantial penalties were imposed. See
638 F. 2d, at 330, n. 3 (Mansfield, J., dissenting).

manipulation of markets and to protect any individual who desires to participate in futures market trading.' Additionally, the Act itself states that

court granted summary judgment on all claims seeking recovery under that statute. National Super Spuds, Inc. v. New
York Mercantile Exchange, 470 F. Supp. 1257, 1259-1263

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit reversed. The majority opinion, written by Judge
Friendly, adopted essentially the same reasoning as the Sixth
Circuit majority in No. 80-203, but placed greater emphasis
on "the 1974 Congress' awareness of the uniform judicial recognition of private rights of action under the Commodity Exchange Act and [its] desire to preserve them," Leist v.
Simplot, 638 F. 2d 283, 307 (1980), and on the similarity between the implied private remedies under the CEA and the
remedies implied under other federal statutes, particularly
those regulating trading in securities, id., at 296-299. Judge
Mansfield, in dissent, reasoned that the pre-1974 cases recognizing a private right of action under the CEA were incorrectly decided and that a fair application of the criteria

Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, 39 (1916) (emphasis supplied)-that is, does the statute create a federal right in favor of the plaintiff? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? See, e. g., National
RailroadPassengerCorp. v. NationalAssn. of RailroadPassengers,414
U. S. 453, 458, 460 (1974) (Amtrak). Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the

"When Congress intends private litigants to have a
cause of action to support their statutory rights, the far
better course is for it to specify as much when it creates
those rights. But the Court has long recognized that
under certain limited circumstances the failure of Congress to do so is not inconsistent with an intent on its
part to have such a remedy available to the persons benefited by its legislation." Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717 (1979).
Our approach to the task of determining whether Congress
intended to authorize a private cause of action has changed
significantly, much as the quality and quantity of federal legislation has undergone significant change. When federal
statutes were less comprehensive, the Court applied a relatively simple test to determine the availability of an implied
private remedy. If a statute was enacted for the benefit of a
special class, the judiciary normally recognized a remedy for
members of that class. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. Rigsby,
241 U. S. 33 (1916).52 Under this approach, federal courts,
inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law? See
Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647, 652 (1963); cf. J. I. Case Co. v. Borak,
377 U. S. 426, 434 (1964); Bivens v. Six Unknoum Federal Narcotics
Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 394-395 (1971); id., at 400 (Harlan, J., concurring in
judgment)."

it results in damage to one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the damages from the party in default

following a common-law tradition, regarded the denial of a
remedy as the exception rather than the rule.53
Because the Rigsby approach prevailed throughout most of
our history,' there is no merit to the argument advanced by
is implied, according to a doctrine of the common law expressed in 1 Com.
Dig., tit. Action upon Statute (F), in these words: 'So, in every case, where
a statute enacts, or prohibits a thing for the benefit of a person, he shall
have a remedy upon the same statute for the thing enacted for his advantage, or for the recompense of a wrong done to him contrary to the said
law.' (PerHolt, C. J., Anon., 6 Mod. 26, 27.) This is but an application
of the maxim, Ubijus ibi remedium. See 3 Black. Com. 51, 123; Couch v.
Steel, 3 El. & Bl. 402, 411; 23 L. J. Q. B. 121, 125." 241 U. S., at 39-40.
'T. Cooley, Law of Torts 790 (2d ed. 1888) described the common-law
remedy for breach of a statutory duty in this way:
"[W]hen the duty imposed by statute is manifestly intended for the protection and benefit of individuals, the common law, when an individual is injured by a breach of the duty, will supply a remedy, if the statute gives
none."
A few years earlier an opinion by Judge Cooley was quoted with approval by this Court in support of its holding that a railroad's breach of a
statutory duty to fence its right-of-way gave an injured party an implied
damages remedy. See Hayes v. Michigan Central R. Co., 111 U. S. 228,
240 (1884).
'See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803) ("'[I1t is a
general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is
also a legal remedy by suit, or action at law, whenever that right is invaded' ") (quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *23); Kendall v. United
States, 12 Pet. 524, 624 (1838) ("It cannot be denied but that congress had
the power to command that act to be done; and the power to enforce the
performance of the act must rest somewhere, or it will present a case

undeniable right should be shown to exist"); Pollard v. Bailey, 20 Wall.

petitioners that the judicial recognition of an implied private
remedy violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. As Justice Frankfurter explained:
"Courts ... are organs with historic antecedents which
bring with them well-defined powers. They do not require explicit statutory authorization for familiar remedies to enforce statutory obligations. Texas & N. 0. R.
Co. v. Brotherhood of Clerks, 281 U. S. 548; Virginian
R. Co. v. System Federation, 300 U. S. 515; Deckert v.
Independence Shares Corp., 311 U. S. 282. A duty declared by Congress does not evaporate for want of a formulated sanction. When Congress has 'left the matter
at large for judicial determination,' our function is to decide what remedies are appropriate in the light of the
statutory language and purpose and of the traditional
modes by which courts compel performance of legal obligations. See Board of Comm'rs v. United States, 308
U. S. 343, 351. If civil liability is appropriate to effectuate the purposes of a statute, courts are not denied this
traditional remedy because it is not specifically authorized. Texas & Pac. R. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33;
Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 323 U. S. 192; Tunstall

341 U. S. 246, 261-262 (1951) (dissenting opinion).
During the years prior to 1975, the Court occasionally refused to recognize an implied remedy, either because the
statute in question was a general regulatory prohibition enacted for the benefit of the public at large, or because there
was evidence that Congress intended an express remedy to
provide the exclusive method of enforcement.55 While the

Opinion of the Court

Rigsby approach prevailed, however, congressional silence or
ambiguity was an insufficient reason for the denial of a remedy for a member of the class a statute was enacted to
protect.
In 1975 the Court unanimously decided to modify its ap-

proach to the question whether a federal statute includes a
private right of action.57 In Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975),
the Court confronted a claim that a private litigant could recover damages for violation of a criminal statute that had
never before been thought to include a private remedy. In

rejecting that claim the Court outlined criteria that primarily
focused on the intent of Congress in enacting the statute
under review. ' The increased complexity of federal legislation59 and the increased volume of federal litigation strongly

supported the desirability of a more careful scrutiny of legislative intent than Rigsby had required. Our cases subsequent to Cort v. Ash have plainly stated that our focus must
be on "the intent of Congress." Texas Industries, Inc. v.
Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 639 (1981).1 "The

I"There is no allegation that the antitrust laws expressly establish a
right of action for contribution. Nothing in these statutes refers to contribution, and if such a right exists it must be by implication. Our focus,

V
In determining whether a private cause of action is implicit
in a federal statutory scheme when the statute by its terms is

silent on that issue, the initial focus must be on the state of
the law at the time the legislation was enacted. More precisely, we must examine Congress' perception of the law that
it was shaping or reshaping.6 1 When Congress enacts new

legislation, the question is whether Congress intended to create a private remedy as a supplement to the express enforcement provisions of the statute. When Congress acts in a
statutory context in which an implied private remedy has already been recognized by the courts, however, the inquiry

logically is different. Congress need not have intended to
create a new remedy, since one already existed; the question
v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560 (1979). Congressional intent may be discerned by looking to the legislative history and other factors: e. g., the
identity of the class for whose benefit the statute was enacted, the overall
legislative scheme, and the traditional role of the states in providing relief.
See California v. Sierra Club, supra; Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975)."
"1"The legislative history thus leaves little doubt that Congress was persuaded that federal employees who were treated discriminatorily had no
effective judicial remedy. And the case law suggests that that conclusion
was entirely reasonable. Whether that understanding of Congress was in
some ultimate sense incorrect is not what is important in determining the
legislative intent in amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to cover federal
employees. For the relevant inquiry is not whether Congress correctly
perceived the then state of the law, but rather what its perception of the
state of the law was." Brown v. GSA, 425 U. S. 820, 828 (1976) (footnote

is whether Congress intended to preserve the pre-existing
remedy.
In Cannon v. University of Chicago, we observed that "[i]t
is always appropriate to assume that our elected representatives, like other citizens, know the law." 441 U. S., at
696-697. In considering whether Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 included an implied private cause of action for damages, we assumed that the legislators were familiar with the judicial decisions construing comparable language in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as implicitly
authorizing a judicial remedy, notwithstanding the fact that
the statute expressly included a quite different remedy. We
held that even under the "strict approach" dictated by Cort v.
Ash, "our evaluation of congressional action in 1972 must take
into account its contemporary legal context." 441 U. S., at
698-699. See California v. Sierra Club, 451 U. S. 287, 296,
n. 7 (1981).
Prior to the comprehensive amendments to the CEA enacted in 1974, the federal courts routinely and consistently
had recognized an implied private cause of action on behalf of
plaintiffs seeking to enforce and to collect damages for violation of provisions of the CEA or rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute. 62 The routine recognition
of a private remedy under the CEA prior to our decision
in Cort v. Ash was comparable to the routine acceptance of
an analogous remedy under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.6 The Court described that remedy in Blue Chip
12There

is no dispute concerning the state of the law in 1974, even by
those who have argued that a private cause of action under the CEA did
not survive the 1974 amendments. See, e. g., Rivers v. Rosenthal & Co.,

is Not Authorization for Judicial Legislation of an Implied Private Right of
Action, 46 Mo. L. Rev. 316, 321 (1981).

fully consistent with the implication doctrine followed by this Court prior

(footnote omitted):
"Despite the contrast between the provisions of Rule
10b-5 and the numerous carefully drawn express civil
remedies provided in the Acts of both 1933 and 1934, it
was held in 1946 by the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that there was an
implied private right of action under the Rule. Kardon
v. National Gypsum Co., 69 F. Supp. 512. This Court
had no occasion to deal with the subject until 25 years
later, and at that time we confirmed with virtually no
discussion the overwhelming consensus of the District
Courts and Courts of Appeals that such a cause of action
did exist. Superintendentof Insurance v. Bankers Life

Citizens v. United States, 406 U. S.128, 150-154 (1972).
Such a conclusion was, of course, entirely consistent with
the Court's recognition in J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377
U. S.426, 432 (1964), that private enforcement of Commission rules may '[provide] a necessary supplement to
Commission action."'
Although the consensus of opinion concerning the existence
of a private cause of action under the CEA was neither as old
nor as overwhelming as the consensus concerning Rule
10b-5, it was equally uniform and well understood. This
Court, as did other federal courts and federal practitioners,
simply assumed that the remedy was available. The point is
well illustrated by this Court's opinion in Chicago Mercantile
Exchange v. Deaktor, 414 U. S.113 (1973), which disposed of
two separate actions in which private litigants alleged that an
exchange had violated ยง9(b) of the CEA by engaging in price
manipulation and ยง 5a by failing both to enforce its own rules
and to prevent market manipulation.' The Court held that

the judicial proceedings should not go forward without first
making an effort to invoke the jurisdiction of the Commodity
Exchange Commission, but it did not question the availability

of a private remedy under the CEA.'
In view of the absence of any dispute about the proposition
prior to the decision of Cort v. Ash in 1975, it is abundantly
clear that an implied cause of action under the CEA was a
part of the "contemporary legal context" in which Congress
legislated in 1974.
Cf. Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S., at 698-699. In that context, the fact that a comprehensive reexamination and significant amendment of the

CEA left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a cause of action is itself evidence that
market prices and had thereby monopolized and restrained commerce in violation of ยงยง 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and had violated ยง 9(b) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by manipulating prices of a commodity for future delivery on a contract market. The Exchange was also accused of
violating ยง 5a of the CEA for failure to enforce one of its own rules. In the
second suit, the Deaktor case, the Exchange was charged with violating
the CEA and its own rules as a designated contract market because it had
failed to exercise due care to halt the manipulative conduct of certain of its
members who allegedly had cornered the July 1970 market in frozen pork
bellies futures contracts." 414 U. S., at 113-114 (statutory citations
omitted).
'The Court of Appeals had expressly confirmed the availability of a private remedy, see Deaktor v. L. D. Schreiber & Co., 479 F. 2d 529, 534
(CA7 1973), but the exchange did not question that ruling before this
Court. Rather, the exchange's complaint concerned the Court of Appeals'
refusal to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction:
"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has thus been put in an intolerable
position. It must diligently seek to prevent, deter, and punish violations
of its rules; but enforcement of its rules now exposes it to unrestricted attacks in federal courts by disgruntled traders. This situation will disrupt,
if not immobilize, the self-regulatory machinery established by the Commodity Exchange Act. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction expressed in
Ricci was designed to alleviate this dilemma." Pet. for Cert. in Chicago

Congress affirmatively intended to preserve that remedy."'
A review of the legislative history of the statute persuasively
indicates that preservation of the remedy was indeed what
Congress actually intended.
VI

Congress was, of course, familiar not only with the implied
private remedy but also with the long history of federal regulation of commodity futures trading.67 From the enactment

of the original federal legislation, Congress primarily has relied upon the exchanges to regulate the contract markets.
The 1922 legislation required for designation as a contract
market that an exchange "provide for" the making and filing

of reports and records, the prevention of dissemination of
false or misleading reports, the prevention of price manipulation and market cornering, and the enforcement of Commission orders.' To fulfill these conditions, the exchanges promulgated rules and regulations, but they did not always
enforce them. In 1968, Congress attempted to correct this
flaw in the self-regulation concept by enacting ยง 5a(8), 7
U. S. C. ยง 7a(8), which requires the exchanges to enforce
their own rules."
"'Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts
a statute without change, see Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S.

least insofar as it affects the new statute." Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S.

Opinion of the Court

The enactment of ยง 5a(8), coupled with the recognition by
the federal courts of an implied private remedy for violations
of the CEA, gave rise to a new problem. As representatives
of the exchanges complained during the hearings preceding
the 1974 amendments, 0 the exchanges were being sued for
not enforcing their rules. The complaint was taken seriously
because it implicated the self-regulation premise of the CEA:
"In the few years [ยง 5a(8)] has been in the present
Commodity Exchange Act, there is growing evidence to
indicate that, as opposed to strengthening the self-regulatory concept in present law, such a provision, coupled
with only limited federal authority to require the exchanges to make and issue rules appropriate to enforcement of the Act-may actually have worked to weaken
it. With inadequate enforcement personnel the Committee was informed that attorneys to several boards of
trade have been advising the boards to reduce-not expand exchange regulations designed to insure fair trading, since there is a growing body of opinion that failure
to enforce the exchange rules is a violation of the Act
which will support suits by private litigants." House
Report, at 46 (emphasis in original).
"'See, e. g., Hearings on H. R. 11955 before the House Committee on
Agriculture, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., 62 (1974); Hearings on Review of Com-

modity Exchange Act and Discussion of Possible Changes before the
House Committee on Agriculture, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 121 (1973).
"'In introducing the House bill, Representative Poage, the Chairman of
the House Agriculture Committee, explained this development at some
length. See 119 Cong. Rec. 41333 (1973). Representative Thone, a member of that Committee, later reiterated the problem. See 120 Cong. Rec.
10748 (1974) ("Some observers believe that the provision of the 1968
amendments requiring exchanges to enforce their own rules, thereby implicitly giving private parties the right to sue for nonenforcement, has had
a perverse effect. To avoid risk of litigation, exchange authorities have
been encouraged to reduce rather than strengthen rules designed to insure
fair trading").

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
Opinion of the Court

456 U. S.

Congress could have removed this impediment to exchange
rulemaking by eliminating the implied private remedy,'2 but
it did not follow that course. Rather, it solved the problem
by authorizing the new Commodity Futures Trading Commission to supplement exchange rules." Congress thereby
corrected the legal mechanism of self-regulation while preserving a significant incentive for the exchanges to obey the
law. Only this course was consistent with the expressed
purpose of the 1974 legislation, which was to "amend the
Commodity Exchange Act to strengthen the regulation of futures trading." 74
Congress in 1974 created new procedures through which
traders might seek relief for violations of the CEA, but the
legislative evidence indicates that these informal procedures
were intended to supplement rather than supplant the implied judicial remedy. These procedures do not substitute
for the private remedy either as a means of compensating injured traders or as a means of enforcing compliance with the
statute. The reparations procedure established by ยง 14 is
not available against the exchanges, 5 yet we may infer from
the above analysis that Congress viewed private litigation
against exchanges as a valuable component of the self-regulaSIndeed, Congress was urged to grant the exchanges immunity from

private causes of action. See Hearings on Review of Commodity Exchange Act and Discussion of Possible Changes, supra,at 121. The president of one exchange even proposed the addition of specific language to the
statute that would have granted such immunity. See Hearings on H. R.

tion concept. Nor is that procedure suited for the adjudication of all other claims. The Commission may, but need not,
investigate a complaint, and may, but need not, serve the respondent with the complaint. If the Commission permits the
complaint to issue, it need not provide an administrative
hearing if the claim does not exceed $5,000. The arbitration
procedure mandated by ยง5a(11) is even narrower in scope.
Only members and employees of the contract market are
subject to the procedure, and the use of the procedure by
a trader is voluntary and is limited to claims of less than
$15,000. There are other indications in the legislative history that the two sections were not intended to be exclusive
of the implied judicial remedy. It was assumed by hearings
witnesses that the informal procedures were supplementary."6 Indeed, it was urged that complainants be put to the
choice between informal and judicial actions.' A representative of one exchange urged Congress to place a dollar limit
on claims arbitrable under ยง5a(11) because there was an
"economic impediment to Court litigation" only with small
claims,78 and such a limit was enacted. Chairman Poage
described the newly enacted informal procedures as "new
customer protection features,"79 and Senator Talmadge, the
Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, stated that the reparations procedure was "not in7

hoped that the burden on the courts would be "somewhat
lighten[ed]" by the availability of the informal actions.8"
The late addition of a saving clause in ยง 2(a)(1) provides direct evidence of legislative intent to preserve the implied private remedy federal courts had recognized under the CEA.
Along with an increase in powers, the Commission was given
exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures trading. The
purpose of the exclusive-jurisdiction provision in the bill
passed by the House8" was to separate the functions of the
Commission from those of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies.8 But the provision
raised concerns that the jurisdiction of state and federal
courts might be affected. Referring to the treble damages
action provided in another bill that he and Senator McGovern
had introduced, Senator Clark pointed out: "[T]he House bill
not only does not authorize them, but section 201 of that bill
may prohibit all court actions. The staff of the House Agriculture Committee has said that this was done inadvertently
and they hope it can be corrected in the Senate." ' It was.

supersede or limit the jurisdiction conferred on courts of the
United States or any State." ' The Conference accepted the
Senate amendment."
The inference that Congress intended to preserve the preexisting remedy is compelling. As the Solicitor General
argues on behalf of the Commission as amicus curiae, the
private cause of action enhances the enforcement mechanism
fostered by Congress over the course of 60 years. In an enactment purporting to strengthen the regulation of commodity futures trading, Congress evidenced an affirmative intent
to preserve this enforcement tool.8 It removed an impediment to exchange rulemaking caused in part by the implied
private remedy not by disapproving that remedy but rather
by giving the Commission the extraordinary power to supplement exchange rules. And when several Members of Congress expressed a concern that the exclusive-jurisdiction
provision, which was intended only to consolidate federal
regulation of commodity futures trading in the Commission,
might be construed to affect the implied cause of action as
well as other court actions, Congress acted swiftly to dispel
any such notion. Congress could have made its intent
clearer only by expressly providing for a private cause of action in the statute. In the legal context in which Congress
acted, this was unnecessary.
'See 7 U. S. C. ยง2.
Chairmen Talmadge and Poage reported that "the conferees wished to

make clear that nothing in the act would supersede or limit the jurisdiction

" In his opinion for the Second Circuit panel majority, Judge Friendly

restate that analysis in the same detail.

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
Opinion of the Court

456 U. S.

In view of our construction of the intent of the Legislature
there is no need for us to "trudge through all four of the factors when the dispositive question of legislative intent has
been resolved." See Californiav. Sierra Club, 451 U. S., at
302 (REHNQUIST, J., concurring in judgment). We hold that
the private cause of action under the CEA that was previously available to investors survived the 1974 amendments.
VII
In addition to their principal argument that no private
remedy is available under the CEA, petitioners also contend
that respondents, as speculators, may not maintain such an
action and that, in any event, they may not sue an exchange
or futures commission merchants for their alleged complicity
in the price manipulation effected by a group of short traders.
To evaluate these contentions, we must assume the best possible case for the speculator in terms of proof of the statutory
violations, the causal connection between the violations and
the injury, and the amount of damages. It is argued that no
matter how deliberate the defendants' conduct, no matter
how flagrant the statutory violation, and no matter how direct and harmful its impact on the plaintiffs, the federal remedy that is available to some private parties does not encompass these actions.
The cause of action asserted in No. 80-203 is a claim that
respondents' broker violated the prohibitions against fraudulent and deceptive conduct in ยง 4b. In the other three cases
the respondents allege violations of several other sections of
the CEA that are designed to prevent price manipulation."
" Section 4a instructs the Commission to fix trading and position limits to
curb excessive speculation. 7 U. S. C. ยง 6a. Section 5(d) requires as a
condition for designation as a contract market that an exchange prevent
price manipulation by dealers, 7 U. S.C ยง 7(d), and ยง 5a(8) imposes a duty
upon contract markets to enforce their rules, 7 U. S. C. ยง 7a(8). Section
9(b) fixes criminal penalties for price manipulation and other violations of
the CEA. 7 U. S. C. ยง 13(b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).

MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH v. CURRAN

389

Opinion of the Court

We are satisfied that purchasers and sellers of futures contracts have standing to assert both types of claims.
The characterization of persons who invest in futures contracts as "speculators" does not exclude them from the class
of persons protected by the CEA. The statutory scheme
could not effectively protect the producers and processors
who engage in hedging transactions without also protecting
the other participants in the market whose transactions over
exchanges necessarily must conform to the same trading
rules. This is evident from the text of the statute. The
antifraud provision, ยง4b, 7 U. S. C. ยง6b, by its terms makes
it unlawful for any person to deceive or defraud any other
person in connection with any futures contract. This statutory language does not limit its protection to hedging transactions; rather, its protection encompasses every contract
that "is or may be used for (a) hedging ... or (b) determining
the price basis of any transaction ...

in such commodity."

See n. 18, supra. Since the limiting language defines the
character of the contracts that are covered, and since futures
contracts traded over a regulated exchange are fungible, it is
manifest that all such contracts may be used for hedging or
price basing, even if the parties to a particular futures trade
may both be speculators. In other words, all purchasers or
sellers of futures contracts-whether they be pure speculators or hedgers-necessarily are protected by ยง 4b.I
I The language of ยง 4b is similar to that of ยง 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U. S. C. ยง 78j(b), and this Court has recognized an
implied cause of action under the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Rule 10b-5 on behalf of all securities traders. Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 404 U. S., at 13, n. 9; Blue Chip Stamps
v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U. S. 723 (1975). We recognized in Cannon v.
University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), that the implication of a cause
of action under Rule 10b-5 could be "explained historically"; "the Court explicitly acquiesced in the 25-year-old acceptance by the lower federal courts
of a Rule 10b-5 cause of action." Id., at 692, n. 13. In terms of the number of years and the number of decisions in which an implied cause of action
was recognized, the CEA action does not compare favorably with the Rule

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
Opinion of the Court

456 U. S.

The legislative history quite clearly indicates that Congress intended to protect all futures traders from price
manipulation and other fraudulent conduct violative of the
statute. It is assumed, of course, that federal regulation of
futures trading benefits the entire economy; a sound futures
market tends to reduce retail prices of the underlying commodities. The immediate beneficiaries of a healthy futures
market are the producers and processors of commodities who
can minimize the risk of loss from volatile price changes on
the cash market by hedging on the futures market."9 As the
House Report on the 1974 amendments explained at length,"'
their ability to engage in hedging depends on the availability
of investors willing to assume or to share the hedger's risk in
the hope of making a profit. The statutory proscriptions
against price manipulation and other fraudulent practices
were intended to ensure that hedgers would sell or purchase
the underlying commodities at a fair price and that legitimate
investors would view the assumption of the hedger's risk as a
fair investment opportunity. Although the speculator has
never been the favorite of Congress, Congress recognized his
crucial role in an effective and orderly futures market and intended him to be protected by the statute as much as the
hedger. Judge Friendly's discussion of the legislative history, see 638 F. 2d, at 304-307, amply supports his observation that "[i]t is almost self-evident that legislation regulating
future trading was for the 'especial benefit' of futures traders," id., at 306-307.
Although ยง4b compels our holding that an investor defrauded by his broker may maintain a private cause of action
10b-5 action. On the other hand, Congress comprehensively reexamined
the CEA in 1974 and did not amend the sections under which the cause of
action had been implied; no comparable legislative approval or acquiescence exists for the Rule 10b-5 remedy.

for fraud, petitioners in the three manipulation cases correctly point out that the other sections of the CEA that they

are accused of violating are framed in general terms and do
not purport to confer special rights on any identifiable class of
persons. Under Cort v. Ash, the statutory language would
be insufficient to imply a private cause of action under these
sections." But we are not faced with the Cort v. Ash inquiry.9 We have held that Congress intended to preserve
the pre-existing remedy; to determine whether the pre-existing remedy encompasses respondents' actions, we must turn
once again to the law as it existed in 1974.

Although the first case in which a federal court held that a
futures trader could maintain a private action was a fraud
claim based on ยง 4b,1 subsequent decisions drew no distinction between an action against a broker and an action against
"The Court consistently has found that Congress intended to create a
cause of action 'where the language of the statute explicitly confer[s] a
right directly on a class of persons that include[s] the plaintiff in the case.'
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S.677, 690, n. 13 (1979). Conversely, it has noted that there 'would be far less reason to infer a private
remedy in favor of individual persons' where Congress, rather than drafting the legislation 'with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class,' instead has framed the statute simply as a general prohibition or a command
to a federal agency. Id., at 690-692." UniversitiesResearch Assn., Inc.
v. Coutu, 450 U. S. 754, 771-772 (1981).
"The statutes originally enacted in 1933 and 1934 have been amended
so often with full congressional awareness of the judicial interpretation of
Rule 10b-5 as implicitly creating a private remedy that we must now assume that Congress intended to create rights for the specific beneficiaries

therefore does not present the same kind of issue discussed in Cort v. Ash,

remedy. Rather, the question presented here is who may invoke that
remedy." Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U. S. 1, 55, n. 4

recognizing causes of action on behalf of investors against exchanges. The Deaktor case, which came before this Court,
is an example. 5 Moreover, these actions against exchanges
commodity futures traders against their broker was based on Restatement
of Torts ยง 286 (1938).
"Violation of a legislative enactment by doing a prohibited act makes the
actor liable for an invasion of the interest of another if: (1) the intent of the
enactment is exclusively or in part to protect the interest of the other as an
individual; and (2) the interest invaded is one which the enactment is intended to protect. Restatement, Torts, Section 286. Violation of the
standard of conduct set out in Section 6b of the Commodity Exchange Act
is a tort for which plaintiffs, as members of the class Congress sought to
protect from the type of harm they allege here, have a federal civil remedy
even in the absence of specific mention of a civil remedy in the Commodity
Exchange Act. The Restatement rationale was the basis for the presently
well accepied rule that a civil remedy cognizable in the federal courts will
be implied for a defrauded investor under Section 78j of the Securities Act
of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission regulation 10b-5 thereunder. Kardon v. National Gypsum Co., D. C., 69 F. Supp. 512 (1946)."

were well recognized. During the hearings on the 1974
amendments to the CEA, a complaint voiced by representatives of the exchanges was that the exchanges were being
sued for not enforcing their rules. Congress responded to
the complaint by authorizing the Commission to supplement
exchange rules because, we have inferred," Congress wished
to preserve the private cause of action as a tool for enforcement of the self-regulation concept of the CEA.
To the extent that the Cort v. Ash inquiry " is relevant to
the question now before us-whether respondents' claims can
be pursued under the implied cause of action that Congress
preserved-it is noteworthy that the third and fourth factors
of that inquiry support an affirmative answer. As the Solicitor General has argued on behalf of the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission, it is "consistent with the underlying
purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy." ,
Moreover, there is no basis for believing that state law will
afford an adequate remedy against an exchange. On the
contrary, throughout the long history of federal regulation of
futures trading it has been federal law that has imposed a
stringent duty upon exchanges to police the trading activities

regulatory scheme, the elimination of a significant enforcement tool would clash with this legislative pattern. We
therefore may not simply assume that Congress silently withdrew the pre-existing private remedy against exchanges.1ยฐยฐ
Having concluded that exchanges can be held accountable
for breaching their statutory duties to enforce their own
rules prohibiting price manipulation, it necessarily follows
that those persons who are participants in a conspiracy to
manipulate the market in violation of those rules are also subject to suit by futures traders who can prove injury from
these violations.10' As we said regarding the analogous Rule

damages are likely to raise difficult issues of law and proof in

The Court today holds that Congress intended the federal
courts to recognize implied causes of action under five separate provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), 7
U. S. C. ยง 1 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp IV). The decision
rests on two theories. First, the Court relies on fewer than
a dozen cases in which the lower federal courts erroneously
upheld private rights of action in the years prior to the 1974
amendments to the CEA. Reasoning that these mistaken
decisions constituted "the law" in 1974, the Court holds that
Congress must be assumed to have endorsed this path of
error when it failed to amend certain sections of the CEA in
that year. This theory is incompatible with our constitutional separation of powers, and in my view it is without support in logic or in law. Additionally-whether alternatively
or cumulatively is unclear-the Court finds that Congress in
1974 "affirmatively" manifested its intent to "preserve" pri"'See, e. g., Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green, 430 U. S. 462 (1977);

the Court correctly observes, ante, at 377, reliance on congressional

intent as dispositive of implication questions was at least implicit in the
four-pronged inquiry mandated by Cort v. Ash, 422 U. S. 66 (1975). The
Cort test explicitly called for inquiries into whether plaintiffs were seen by
Congress as especial beneficiaries of a statutory scheme, whether an implied cause of action would be consistent with legislative purpose, and
whether the asserted cause of action traditionally was relegated to state
law. See id., at 78. But these factors all are important primarily as indices of congressional intent. As we recently explained in Texas Industries,
Inc. v. Radcliff Materials,Inc., 451 U. S.630, 639 (1981), "Congressional
intent may be discerned by looking to ....

e. g., the identity of the class

for whose benefit the statute was enacted, the overall legislative scheme,
and the traditional role of the states in providing relief."

not argue that Congress in 1922, in 1936, or in 1968, intended

to authorize private suits for damages in the federal courts.
In 1936-the year in which the CEA was adopted as the successor statute to the Grain Futures Act 3-- Congress did not

by the dealers or operators" upon the exchange. Its terms suggest no intent to confer a right of action on any class of aggrieved persons.
Section 9(b)-as are ยงยง 4a and 4b-is a criminal provision. It establishes
that "[i]t shall be a felony" for "any person" to manipulate commodity
prices, to corner commodities, to deliver false crop or market information,
or to omit or misstate facts to the CFTC. Before today the Court had established that private rights of action generally would not be inferred from
criminal prohibitions. See California v. Sierra Club, 451 U. S.287, 294
(1981); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 690-693, n. 13
(1979).
Sections 4a and 4b were adopted as part of the Commodity Exchange
Act of 1936. See 49 Stat. 1492, 1493. Section 4a provides that it is illegal
for any person to buy, sell, or hold positions in excess of limitations established by the CFTC. Section 4b declares it unlawful for designated persons who make commodity futures contracts for other persons to cheat, defraud, deceive, or make false statements to such other persons. Sections
4a and 4b are similar to ยง 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See
15 U. S. C. ยง 80b-6. We have held explicitly that the language of ยง 206
does not create an implied damages action. TransamericaMortgage Advisors, Inc. (TAMA) v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 16, n. 6, 24 (1979).
Section 5a(8), 7 U. S. C. ยง 7a(8), is traceable to the 1968 amendments.
It directs that each "contract market" shall enforce its own approved rules
relating to contract and trading requirements. Section 5a(8) resembles
the language of 15 U. S. C. ยง 78q(a) (1970 ed.), that we found to create no
implied private damages action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

456 U. S.

If the Court focused its implication inquiry on the intent of
the several Congresses that enacted the statutory provisions
involved in these cases, it thus is indisputable that the plaintiffs would have no claim. "The dispositive question" in implication cases is whether Congress intended to create the
right to sue for damages in federal court. "Having answered
that question in the negative, our inquiry [would be] at an
end." TAMA, supra, at 24. See Sea Clammers, supra, at

13.
The Court today asserts its fidelity to these principles but
shrinks from their application. It does so in the first instance by invoking a novel legal theory-one that relies on
congressional inaction and on erroneous decisions by the
lower federal courts. In 1967 a Federal District Court in the
Northern District of Illinois upheld the existence of a private
right of action under one section of the CEA. Goodman v.
H. Hentz & Co., 265 F. Supp. 440 (1967). Relying on state
common-law principles set forth in ยง 286 of the Restatement
of Torts (1938), Goodman ruled that the "complete absence of
provision for private civil actions in the Commodity Exchange Act," 265 F. Supp., at 447, was not decisive:
"'Implied rights of action are not contingent upon statutory language which affirmatively indicates that they are
intended. On the contrary, they are implied unless the
legislation evidences a contrary intention. Brown v.
Bullock, D.C., 194 F. Supp. 207, 224, affd on other
grounds, 2 Cir., 294 F. 2d 415; cited in Wheeldin v.
Wheeler, 373 U. S. 647 at 661, 662 ... (Brennan, J.,
dissenting).'
"There is no indication in the Commodity Exchange Act
that Congress intended not to allow private persons injured by violations access to the federal courts." Ibid.
(emphasis added).
The Court does not dispute that the Goodman court erred.
The Goodman court placed primary emphasis on inquiring

MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH v. CURRAN

POWELL,

399

J., dissenting

whether Congress had created a regulatory system for the
benefit of the plaintiffs' class. As the court's citation of the
Restatement of Torts made apparent, this inquiry has been
thought appropriate for common-law courts of general jurisdiction. But our cases establish that it is not appropriate for
federal courts possessed only of limited jurisdiction. On the
contrary, we have established that an "argument in favor of
implication of a private right of action based on tort principles
...is entirely misplaced." Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 568 (1979). "The dispositive question [is]
whether Congress intended to create any such [private damages] remedy." TAMA, 444 U. S., at 24 (emphasis added).
The Goodman court did not even ask this question.'
5
The Court correctly observes that the effect of Cort v. Ash was to
"modify [this Court's] approach to the question whether a federal statute
includes a private right of action." Ante, at 377 (emphasis added). As
exemplifying a previous approach the Court quotes Texas & Pacific R. Co.
v. Rigsby, 241 U. S. 33, 39 (1916): "A disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for
whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the

damages from the party in default is implied .

. . ."

The Court does not

appear to argue, however, that Rigsby mandated the Goodman decision.
Nor does Rigsby somehow validate Goodman as a correct statement of the
law as it was in 1967. As is clear from a reading of the opinion, Rigsby
stated not so much a rule of substantive law as a maxim of statutory construction. Rigsby did not question that the creation of rights of action was
a congressional function. On the contrary, in Rigsby the Court devoted
most of its opinion, not to the question whether a remedy could be "implied" under the statute, but to the question whether it was within the constitutional power of Congress to impose tort liability of the kind asserted.
See 241 U. S., at 40-43 (asserting that plaintiff will be entitled to recover
"unless it be beyond the power of Congress under the commerce clause of
the Constitution to create such a liability") (emphasis added).
Moreover, although the Rigsby approach made the denial of a damages
action "the exception rather than the rule," ante, at 375, the Court even
during the Rigsby period refused to recognize implied remedies where the
evidence-even with the aid of the maxim-failed to indicate that Congress
had intended to create them. See, e. g., T. I. M. E. Inc. v. United States,
359 U. S.464, 474 (1959) ("The question is, of course, one of statutory in-

One of these cases, Deaktor v. L. D. Schreiber& Co., 479 F. 2d 529, 534
(CA7), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Chicago MercantileExchange v.
Deaktor, 414 U. S. 113 (1973), did come before this Court. But the petition for certiorari included no "implication" question, and our per curiam
opinion decided the case on primary jurisdiction grounds. Reversing the
decision of the Court of Appeals, which had upheld the jurisdiction of the
District Court to entertain a private suit for damages under the CEA, we
held that "the Deaktor plaintiffs, who ... alleged violations of the CEA
and the rules of the [Chicago Mercantile] Exchange, should be routed in
the first instance to the [Commodity Exchange Commission] whose administrative functions appear to encompass adjudication of the kind of substantive claims made against the Exchange in this case." Id., at 115.
The Court today notes that Deaktor"did not question the availability of a
private remedy under the CEA." Ante, at 381. But neither does Deaktor exert any precedential force on an issue that the parties did not present
and the Court did not decide. In any event, our disposition of the Deaktor
case-referring the matters complained of to the Commodity Exchange
Commission-at least is consistent with a view that plaintiffs enjoy no private rights of action in the courts, but that they are entitled to seek administrative relief through the procedures made available under the CEA.

tions of one sentence discussing the CEA's purpose.9 This
single sentence "leaves no doubt that Congress intended
to [benefit the named classes of persons by enacting the
CEA] .... But whether Congress intended additionally
that [the CEA] provisions would be enforced through private
litigation is a different question." TAMA, supra, at 17-18.
Because these cases ignore this "different question," they fail
to rectify Goodman's fundamental legal error-that of basing
a finding of an implied cause of action under a federal statute
on common-law principles. "There is, of course, 'no federal
general common law."' Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff
Materials, Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 640 (1981), quoting Erie R.
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78 (1938).
To the Court, however, this all is irrelevant. The Goodman line may have been wrong. The decisions all may have
been rendered by lower federal courts. Goodman nevertheless was "the law" in 1974. Moreover, the Court reasons,
Congress must be presumed to have known of Goodman and
its progeny, see ante, at 378-382; and it could have changed
the law if it did not like it, see ante, at 381-382. Yet Congress, the Court continues, "left intact the statutory provisions under which the federal courts had implied a cause of
action." Ante, at 381. This legislative inaction, the Court
concludes, signals a conscious intent to "preserve" the right
of action that Goodman mistakenly had created. Ante, at
382. And this unexpressed "affirmative intent" of Congress
now is binding on this Court, as well as all other federal
courts. 10

This line of reasoning is inconsistent with fundamental
premises of our structure of government. Fewer than a
dozen District Courts wrongly create a remedy in damages
under the CEA; Congress fails to correct the error; and congressional silence binds this Court to follow the erroneous decisions of the District Courts and Courts of Appeals. The
Court today does not say that Goodman was correctly decided. Congress itself surely would reject emphatically the
Goodman view that federal courts are free to hold, as a general rule of statutory interpretation, that private rights of action are to be implied unless Congress "evidences a contrary
intention." Yet today's decision is predicated in major part
on this view.
It is not surprising that the Court-having propounded
this novel theory that congressional intent can be inferred
from its silence, and that legislative inaction should achieve
the force of law-would wish to advance an additional basis
for its decision.
II
In 1974 Congress rewrote much of the CEA. It did not,
however, re-enact or even amend most of the provisions
under which the Court today finds implied rights of action.
But the Court does not pause over the question how Consions in the Goodman line, it would seem Congress also should be presumed to have known of this Court's 1974 decision in Amtrak, supra.

Amtrak properly directed that the implication of rights of action must adhere to congressional intent. See 414 U. S., at 457-458. More importantly, Amtrak also would have alerted Congress that its provision of a
comprehensive scheme of administrative remedies-and the 1974 amendments to the CEA admittedly provided such a scheme, see ante, at
384-385--would give rise to an inference of intent to preclude alternative
modes of relief. See 414 U. S., at 458 ("[W]hen legislation expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies"). The Court does not explain the relationship of Amtrak to Congress' presumptive knowledge of
"the 'contemporary legal context' in which [it] legislated in 1974." Ante,

gress might legislate a right of action merely by remaining
silent after the lower federal courts have misstated the law."
Instead it argues that at least some of the 1974 amendments
evidenced an affirmative congressional intent to "preserve"
implied rights of action under the CEA. Ante, at 381-382.
Fairly read, the evidence fails to sustain this argument.
A
In support of its argument the Court advances no evidence
of the kinds generally recognized as most probative of congressional intent. It cites no statutory language stating an
intent to preserve judicially created rights. It offers no legislative materials citing Goodman or any of its progeny in approving tones. In the hundreds of pages of Committee hearings and Reports that preceded the 1974 amendments, the
Court is unable to discover even a single clear remark to the
effect that the 1974 amendments would create or preserve
private rights of action.
The Court relies instead on three unrelated additions to
the CEA that were adopted by Congress in 1974. First, the
Court places weight on the enactment of ยง 8a(7), 7 U. S. C.
ยง 12a(7), which authorizes the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission to supplement the trading regulations established by individual commodity exchanges. Ante, at 384.
The accompanying House Report, H. R. Rep. No. 93-975,
" The Court opinion, see ante, at 381-382, and n. 66, cites cases in which
we previously have held that "Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change .... ." Lorillard v.
Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580-581 (1978). Here, however, Congress did not reenact the provisions in issue in 1974; the relevant 1974 amendments altered
existing language, but without actively readopting the terms that were left
unchanged. It also is significant that the statute involved in Lorillard expressly authorized private civil actions. Id., at 579, n. 6. The Court cites
no case in which a presumption of congressional awareness was based on
erroneous lower court decisions.

p. 46 (1974), explained that the CFTC needed this power to
ensure that the local exchanges would establish adequate
safeguards. According to the Report, "attorneys to several
boards of trade have been advising the boards to reduce-not
expand exchange regulations...

,

since there is a growing

body of opinion that failure to enforce the exchange rules is a
violation of the Act which will support suits by private litigants." From this observation the Court purports to infer
that Congress must have approved of the Goodman line of
cases.
This single quotation, however, is entirely neutral as to
approval or disapproval. Moreover, there is persuasive
evidence on the face of the statute that Congress did not
contemplate a judicial remedy for damages against the
exchanges. The 1974 amendments explicitly subjected the
exchanges to fines and other sanctions for nonenforcement of
their own rules. See ยง6b, 7 U. S. C. ยง 13a. But the statute
specifies that fines may not exceed $100,000 per violation,
ibid., and that the Commission must determine whether the
amount of any fine will impair an exchange's ability to perform its functions. A private damages action would not be
so limited and therefore would expose the exchanges to
greater liability than Congress evidently intended.
The second statutory change cited by the Court actually
undercuts rather than supports its case. The Court notes
that the 1974 Congress enacted two sections creating procedures for reimbursing victims of CEA violations.12 Ante, at
'"The added reimbursement procedures are of two types.
1974 Congress added ยง 5a(l1) to the Act.

This pro-

vision requires commodity exchanges to "provide a fair and equitable
procedure through arbitration or otherwise for the settlement of customers' claims and grievances against any member or employee [of the

ing less than $15,000.

This process evidently is designed to encourage the

384-385. In its view these sections evidence a further intent
to enhance the availability of relief in damages. Yet the
Court suggests no reason why the 1974 Congress would have
enacted these duplicative channels for damages recovery if it

intended at the same time to approve the implied private
damages actions permitted by Goodman.13 Rather, the
Court flatly contravenes settled rules for the identification of

congressional intent. "[I]t is an elemental canon of statutory
construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading
others into it." TAMA, 444 U. S., at 19.1' "In the absence
speedy and voluntary resolution of smaller customer disputes at the exchange level.
Second, the 1974 amendments included a new ยง 14 that expressly authorized damages actions. See 88 Stat. 1393-1394. This adjudicatory procedure apparently is designed to resolve larger disputes or smaller ยง 5a(l1)
disputes that are not settled. The actions are brought before the Commission rather than before an exchange. There is no limit on the amount of
damages that may be awarded. The Commission's judgments are enforceable by actions in federal district court. 7 U. S. C. ยง 18.
" Instead of attempting to explain this overlap between the express and
the implied CEA remedies, the Court points to the limitations Congress
placed on its express remedies as compared to an implied Goodman action. See ante, at 384-385, and n. 75. The Court suggests that Congress'
scheme is wanting as a tool for compensation and deterrence. The opposite inference would be more reasonable. One normally would assume
that Congress took care to prescribe precisely those remedies compatible
with its view of the costs and benefits of different modes of regulation.
"When a statute limits a thing to be done in a particular mode, it includes
the negative of any other mode." Botany Worsted Mills v. United States,
278 U. S. 282, 289 (1929). See Sea Clammers, 453 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1981).
""The presumption that a remedy was deliberately omitted from a statute is strongest when Congress has enacted a comprehensive legislative
scheme including an integrated system of procedures for enforcement....
The judiciary may not, in the face of such comprehensive legislative
schemes, fashion new remedies that might upset carefully considered legislative programs." Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Transport Workers, 451

of strong indicia of a contrary congressional intent, we are
compelled to conclude that Congress provided precisely the
remedies it considered appropriate." Sea Clammers, 453
U. S., at 15.
The Court finally relies upon congressional enactment of
a so-called jurisdictional saving clause as part of the 1974
amendments:
"Nothing in this section shall supersede or limit the jurisdiction conferred on courts of the United States or
any State." ยง201 (amending ยง2 of the Act), 88 Stat.
1395, codified at 7 U. S. C. ยง 2 (emphasis added).
Ante, at 386-387.
By its terms the saving clause simply is irrelevant to the
issue at hand: whether a cause of action should be implied
under particular provisions of the CEA. Where judicially
cognizable claims do exist, the saving clause makes clear that
federal courts retain their jurisdiction. But it neither creates nor preserves any substantive right to sue for damages.
And it is settled by our cases that "[t]he source of plaintiffs'
rights must be found, if at all, in the substantive provisions of
the ... Act which they seek to enforce, not in the jurisdictional provision." Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442
U. S., at 577. Cf. Sea Clammers, supra, at 15-17 (refusing
to imply right of action even from a substantive "saving
clause"). 11
U. S. 77, 97 (1981). See also Sea Clammers, supra, at 13-15; Touche Ross
& Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S., at 574; Amtrak, 414 U. S., at 458.
In an effort to show that these reparation procedures were designed to
supplement implied rights of action, the Court reviews comments made by
hearing witnesses that allude to the existence of "court" actions. Ante, at
385-386, and nn. 76-80. These references, however, fairly must be characterized as ambiguous.
" In attaching substantive significance to the jurisdictional saving provision, the Court relies heavily on an isolated remark by Senator Clark. See
ante, at 386. Senator Clark is not identified as a legislative draftsman,

Despite its imaginative use of other sources, the Court neglects the only unambiguous evidence of Congress' intent respecting private actions for civil damages under the CEA.
That evidence is a chart that appears in the record of Senate
Committee hearings.' 6 This chart compares features of four
proposed bills with the "Present Commodities Exchange
Act." It evidently was prepared by the expert Committee staff advising the legislators who considered the 1974
amendments.
The chart is detailed. It occupies five pages of the hearing
record. Comparing the feature of "civil money penalties"
between the different proposed bills, however, the chart does
not list "implied damages actions" under the existing Act.
Rather, it says there are "none." Neither does the chart
make any reference to implied private damages actions under
any of the four proposed amending bills.
Under these circumstances, the most that the Court fairly
can claim to have shown is that the 1974 Congress did not disfloor manager, or committee chairman. Cf. Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,
425 U. S. 185, 204, n. 24 (1976) ("Remarks of this kind made in the course
of legislative debate or hearings other than by persons responsible for the
preparation or the drafting of a bill are entitled to little weight"). Moreover, the Court advances no evidence that even Senator Clark was thinking of Goodman actions when he expressed his concern to preserve existing state and federal jurisdiction. It is equally plausible that he was
thinking primarily of federal antitrust jurisdiction and state-court jurisdiction over contract claims. These were, in fact, precisely the grounds on
which three other witnesses, appearing before the same Senate Committee
as Senator Clark, criticized the language of an earlier draft of the saving
clause. See Hearings on S. 2485, S. 2578, S. 2837 and H. R. 13113 before
the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, 93d Cong., 2d Sess.,
259-260 (1974) (Chairman Rodino of the House Committee on the Judiciary); id., at 663-664 (Deputy Assistant Attorney General Clearwaters);
id., at 667-668 (Director Halverson of the Bureau of Competition, Federal
Trade Commission).

approve Goodman and its progeny. There simply is no persuasive evidence of affirmative congressional intent to recognize rights through the enactment of statutory law, even
under the Court's unprecedented theory of congressional
ratification by silence of judicial error.
III
The Court's holding today may reflect its view of desirable
policy. If so, this view is doubly mistaken.
First, modern federal regulatory statutes tend to be exceedingly complex. Especially in this context, courts should
recognize that intricate policy calculations are necessary to
decide when new enforcement measures are desirable additions to a particular regulatory structure. Judicial creation
of private rights of action is as likely to disrupt as to assist the functioning of the regulatory schemes developed by
Congress. See, e. g., Universities Research Assn., Inc. v.
Coutu, 450 U. S. 754, 782-784 (1981).
Today's decision also is disquieting because of its implicit
view of the judicial role in the creation of federal law. The
Court propounds a test that taxes the legislative branch with
a duty to respond to opinions of the lower federal courts.
The penalty for silence is the risk of having those erroneous
judicial opinions imputed to Congress itself-on the basis of
its presumptive knowledge of the "contemporary legal context." Ante, at 379. Despite the Court's allusion to the
lawmaking powers of courts at common law, see ante, at
374-377, this view is inconsistent with the theory and structure of our constitutional government.
For reasons that I have expressed before, I remain convinced that "we should not condone the implication of any private right of action from a federal statute absent the most
compelling evidence that Congress in fact intended such an
action to exist." Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441
U. S. 677, 749 (1979) (POWELL, J., dissenting).

dreamed. The escalating recourse to damages suits has placed a severe
and growing burden on the lower federal courts. My research-accomplished mostly through a computer search of cases in the federal reporters-indicates that in the past decade there have been at least 243 reported
Court of Appeals opinions and 515 District Court opinions dealing with the
existence of implied causes of action under various federal statutes. It is
time federal courts discontinued the speculative creation of damages liability where the legislative branch has chosen to remain silent.
