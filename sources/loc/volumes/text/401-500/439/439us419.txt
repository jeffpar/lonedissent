Per Curiam and Supplemental Decree

perfected rights in each State and their priority dates are
determined to be as set forth below, subject to the following:
(1) The following listed present perfected rights relate
to the quantity of water which may be used by each
claimant and the list is not intended to limit or redefine
the type of use otherwise set forth in said Decree.
(2) This determination shall in no way affect future
adjustments resulting from determinations relating to settlement of Indian reservation boundaries referred to in
Art. II (D) (5) of said Decre.
(3) Article IX of said Decree is not affected by this list
of present perfected rights.
(4) Any water right listed herein may be exercised
only for beneficial uses.
(5) In the event of a determination of insufficient
mainstream water to satisfy present perfected rights pursuant to Art. II (B) (3) of said Decree, the Secretary of
the Interior shall, before providing for the satisfaction of
any of the other present perfected rights except for those
listed herein as "MISCELLANEOUS PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS" (rights numbered 7-21 and 29-80
below) in the order of their priority dates without regard
to State lines, first provide for the satisfaction in full of
all rights of the Chemehuevi Indian Reservation, Cocopah
Indian Reservation, Fort Yuma Indian Reservation, Colorado River Indian Reservation, and the Fort Mojave
Indian Reservation as set forth in Art. II (D) (1)-(5) of
said Decree, provided that the quantities fixed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of Art. II (D) of said Decree shall
continue to be subject to appropriate adjustment by
agreement or decree of this Court in the event that the
boundaries of the respective reservations are finally determined. Additional present perfected rights so adjudicated
by such adjustment shall be in annual quantities not to
exceed the quantities of mainstream water necessary to

OCTOBER TERM, 1978

supply the consumptive use required for irrigation of the
practicably irrigable acres which axe included within any
area determined to be within a reservation by such final
determination of a boundary and for the satisfaction of
related uses. The quantities of diversions are to be computed by determining net practicably irrigable acres
within each additional area using the methods set forth
by the Special Master in this case in his Report to this
Court dated December 5, 1960, and by applying the unit
diversion quantities thereto, as listed below:

The foregoing reference to a quantity of water necessary
to supply consumptive use required for irrigation, and
as that provision is included within paragraphs (1)
through (5) of Art. II (D) of said Decree, shall constitute
the means of determining quantity of adjudicated water
rights but shall not constitute a restriction of the usage
of them to irrigation or other agricultural application.
If all or part of the adjudicated water rights of any
of the five Indian Reservations is used other than for
irrigation or other agricultural application, the total consumptive use, as that term is defined in Art. I (A) of
said Decree, for said Reservation shall not exceed the
consumptive use that would have resulted if the diversions listed in subparagraph (i) of paragraphs (1)
through (5) of Art. II (D) of said Decree and the
equivalent portions of any supplement thereto had been
used for irrigation of the number of acres specified for
that Reservation in said paragraphs and supplement and

ARIZONA v. CALIFORNIA

Per Curiam and Supplemental Decree

for the satisfaction of related uses. Effect shall be given
to this paragraph notwithstanding the priority dates of
the present perfected rights as listed below. However,
nothing in this paragraph (5) shall affect the order in
which such rights listed below as "MISCELLANEOUS
PRESENT PERFECTED RIGHTS" (numbered 7-21
and 29-80 below) shall be satisfied. Furthermore,
nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to determine the order of satisfying any other Indian water rights
claims not herein specified.
