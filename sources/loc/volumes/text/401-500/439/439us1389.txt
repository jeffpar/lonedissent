BOSTON v. ANDERSON

Opinion in Chambers

CITY OF BOSTON ET AL. v. ANDERSON ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-355 (78-649).

Decided October 20, 1978

Application to stay, pending disposition of an appeal, Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court's judgment enjoining applicant city and city
officials from expending funds in support of a referendum proposal on
the November 1978 state general election ballot changing the state real
property tax system, is granted. It appears that the balance of
equities favors granting the application and that at least four Members
of this Court would vote to grant plenary review of the question whether
the Massachusetts statute barring municipalities from expending funds
to influence elections is constitutional.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN,

Circuit Justice.

The city of Boston, its mayor, and several of its elected
officials, have applied to me for a stay of the judgment of the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court entered October 4,
1978, enjoining them, inter alia, from expending city funds in
support of a referendum proposal on the ballot of the November 1978 general election. If adopted, the proposal would
authorize the Massachusetts Legislature to supersede the
present tax system of 100% valuation of real property by a
system that would, inter alia, classify real property according
to its use in no more than four classes and assess, rate, and
tax such property differently in the classes so established.
The Supreme Judicial Court held that Mass. Gen. Laws
Ann., ch. 55 (West Supp. 1978-1979), barred municipalities
from engaging in the expenditure of funds to influence election
results. Mass. - , 380 N. E. 2d 628 (1978). Only last
Term this Court struck down a provision of chapter 55 that
imposed a ban on private corporate financing of advocacy
on referendum questions as abridging expression that the First
and Fourteenth Amendments were meant to protect. Pirst

OCTOBER TERM, 1978
439 U.S.

Opinion in Chambers

Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765 (1978). The
Supreme Judicial Court held in the instant case, however, that
even if "constitutionally protected speech includes the right
of a municipality to speak militantly about a referendum issue
of admitted public importance where the Legislature of the
Mass., at -, 380 N. E. 2d, at
State has said it may not," 637, "there are demonstrated, compelling interests of the Commonwealth which justify the 'restraint' which the Commonwealth has placed on the city," id., at -, 380 N. E. 2d, at 637,
namely, "[t]he Commonwealth has an interest in assuring
that a dissenting minority of taxpayers is not compelled to
finance the expression on an election issue of views with which
380 N. E. 2d, at 639.
they disagree." Id., at -,
In deciding whether to grant a stay pending disposition of
the jurisdictional statement I must consider two factors:
"First, 'a Circuit Justice should "balance the equities"...
and determine on which side the risk of irreparable injury
weighs most heavily.' Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U. S.

1304, 1308-1309 (1973)

(MARsHALL,

J., in chambers).

Second, assuming a balance of equities in favor of the
applicant, the Circuit Justice must also determine whether
'it is likely that four Members of this Court would vote
to grant a writ of certiorari.' Id., at 1310. The burden
of persuasion as to both of these issues rests on the applicant . . . ." Beame v. Friends of the Earth, 434 U. S.

1310, 1312 (1977)

(MARSHALL,

J., in chambers).

In my view the balance of the equities favors the grant
of the application. In light of Bellotti, corporate industrial
and commercial opponents of the referendum are free to
finance their opposition. On the other hand, unless the stay
is granted, the city is forever denied any opportunity to
finance communication to the statewide electorate of its views
in support of the referendum as required in the interests of all
taxpayers, including residential property owners.

Opinion in Chambers

I am also of the view that at least four Members of this
Court will vote to grant plenary review of this important
constitutional question.
Accordingly, I grant the application and stay the judgment
of October 4, 1978, pending further action of this Court or
myself as Circuit Justice.
