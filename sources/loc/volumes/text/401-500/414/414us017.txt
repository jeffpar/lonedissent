*TAYLOR v. UNITED STATES
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT

N6. 72-6915. Decided November 5, 1973
Petitioner effectively waived his right to be present at his criminal
trial by voluntarily absenting himself therefrom through failure
to return to the courtroom after the. morning session of the first
day of trial, and the Court -f Appeals properly applied Fed. Rule
Crim. Proc. 48 and affirned the- conviction, it being unnecessary
to shoW that petitioner knew. or had been expressly warned by the
trial court not only that he had a right to be present but also that
the trial would continue in his absence alid thereby'effectively foreclose his right to testify and to confront personally the witnesses
against him.- Diaz v. United States; 223 U. S. 442.
Certiorari granted; 478 F. 2d 689, affirmed.
PER (URIAM.

On the first day of his trial on four counts of selling
cocaine in violation of 26 U. S. C. ยง 4705 (a) (1964 ed.),
petitioner failed to return for the afternoon session. He
had been present at the expiratiori of the morning session
when the court announced that the lunch recess would
last until 2 p. m., and he had been told by his attorney
to return to the courtroom at that time. The judge
recessed the trial until the following morning, but peti-tioner still did not appear. .His wife testified that she had
left the courtroom the previous day with petitioner after
the morning session; that they had separated after-sharinr
a taxicab to Rokbury; that he had not appeared ill;- and,
finally, that she had not heard from him since. The
trial judge then denied a motion for mistrial by defense
counsel, who asserted that the jurors' minds .would be
tainted by petitioner's absence and that coniinuation of
the trial in his absence deprived him of his.Sixth Amendment. right to confront witnesses against him. Relying

upon Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 43,1 which expressly provides
that a defendant's voluntary absence "shall not prevent
continuing the trial," the court found that petitioner had
absented himself voluntarily from the proceedings.
Throughout the remainder of the trial, the court
admonished the jury that no inference of guilt could be
drawn from petitioner's absence. Petitioner was found
guilty on all four counts. Following his subsequent
arrest, he was sentenced to the statutory five-year minimum. " The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, 478
F. 2d 681 (CA1 1973), and we now grant the motion for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for
certiorari and affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.
There is no challenge ,to the trial court's conclusion
that petitioner's absence from the trial was voluntary,2
and no claim that the continuation of the trial was not
authorized by Rule 43. Nor are we persuaded that
Rule 43 is unconstitutional or that petitioner was deproved of any constitutional rights in the circumstances
before us. Rule 43 has remained unchanged since the
adoption of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in
1945; .and with respect to the consequences of the defendaht's voluntary absence from trial, it reflects the long1 Rule 43 provides, in pertinent part:

"The defendant shall be present at the arraignment, at every
stage of the trial including the impaneling of the jury and the
return of'the verdict, and at the imposition of sentence, except as
otherwise provided by these rules. In prosecutions for offenses not
punishable by death, the defendant's voluntary absence after the
trial has been commenced in his presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to and including the return of the verdict."
2 Following an independent review of the transcripts from the
trial and sentencing hearing, the Court of Appeals also concluded
that petitioner knew that he was entitled to be present in court
during every stage of his trial and that his absence was a product
of bis voluntary choice. 478 F. 2d 689, 691 n. 4 (1973).

standing rule recognized by this Court in Diaz v. United
,States, 223 U. S. 442, 455 (1912):
"[W]here the offense is not capital and the accused
is not in custody, the prevailing rule has been, that
if, after the trial has begun in his presence, he voluntarily absents himself, this does not nullify what
hds been done or prevent the completion of the trial,
but, on the contrary, operates as a waiver of his
right to be present and leaves the court free to
proceed with the trial in like manner and with like
effect as if he were present." (Citations omitted.)
Under this rule; the District Court and the Court of
Appeals correctly rejected petitioner's claims.
Petitioner, however, insists that his mere voluntary
absence from his trial cannot be construed as an effective
waiver, that is, "an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege," JohnsonV. Zerbst,
304 U. S. 458, 464 (1938), unless it is demonstrated
that he knew or had been expressly warned by the trial
court not only that he had a right to be present but also
that the trial would continue in his absence and thereby
effectively foreclose his right to testify and to confront
personally the witnesses against him.3
3 This was substantially the holding of United States v. McPherson,
137 U. S. App. D. C. 192, 195, 421 F. 2d 1127, 1130 (1969), on which
petitioner relies. But the Court of Appeals in the case now before'
us disagreed with McPherson, and, in our view, rightly so. McPherson itself appears to have strayed from recent precedent in the
District of Columbia Circuit, Cureton v. United States, 130 U. S.
App. D. C. 22, 396 F. 2d 671 (1968), as well as from older authority.
See Falk v. United States, 15 App. D. C. 446, 454-461 (1899). In
Cureton, supra, Judge Fahy stated the controlling rule:
"[I]f- a defendant at liberty remains away during his trial the court
may proceed provided it is clearly established that his absence is
voluntary. He must be aware of the processes taking place, of his
right and of his obligation to be present, and he must have ho

Like the Court of Appeals, we cannot accept this
,position. Petitioner had no right to interrupt the trial
by his voluntary absence, as he implicitly concedes by
urging only that he should" have been warned that no
such right existed and that the trial would proceed in
his absence. The right at issue is the right to be present,
and the question becomes whether that right was effectively waived by his voluntary absence. Consistent with
Rule 43 and Diaz, we conclude that it was.
It is wholly incredible to suggest that petitioner, who
was at liberty on bail, had attended the opening session
of his trial, and: had a duty to be present at the trial,
see Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1951), entertained
any doubts about his right to be present at every stage
.of his trial. It seems equally incredible to us, as it did
to the Court of Appeals, "that a: defendant who flees
from a courtroom in the midst of a trial-where judge,
jury, witnesses and lawyers are present and ready to
continue--would not know that as a consequence the
trial could .continue -in his absence." 478 F. 2d, at
691.
Here the Court of Appeals noted that when
petitioner was questioned at sentencing regarding his
flight, he never contended that he was unaware that a con:
sequence of his flight would be a continuation of the trial
without him. Moreover, no issue of the voluntariness of
his disappearance was ever raised. As was recently noted,
"there can be no doubt whatever that the governmental
prerogative to proceed with a trial may not be defeated
by conduct of the accused that prevents the trial from
going forward." Illinois v. Allen, 397 U. S. 337,349 (1970)
(BRENNAN, J., concurring). Under the circumstances
present here, the Court of Appeals properly applied Rule
43 and affirmed the judgment of conviction.

sound reason for remaining away."
