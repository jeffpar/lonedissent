ON APPLICATION TO VACATE STAY
No. A-150.

Decided August 1, 1973

Application to vacate stay of Court of Appeals' order staying District Court's permanent injunction prohibiting respondent Defense
Department officials from "participating in any way in military
activities in or over Cambodia or releasing any bombs which may
fall in Cambodia" is denied, ag MR. JuSTicE MARSHALL cannot
say, in light of the complexity and importance of the issues posed,
that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion. The highly controversial constitutional question involving the two other branches
of the Government should follow the regular appellate procedures
on the accelerated schedule suggested by the Court of Appeals.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, Circuit Justice.

This case is before me on an application to vacate a stay
entered by a three-judge panel of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Applicants, a Congresswoman from New York and several Air Force officers
serving in Asia, brought this action to enjoin continued
United States air operations over Cambodia. They argue
that such military activity has not been authorized by
Congress and that, absent such authorization, it violates
Art. I, § 8, c. 11, of the Constitution.' The United
States District Court agreed and, on applicants' motion
for summary judgment, permanently enjoined respondents, the Secretary of Defense, the Acting Secretary of
the Air Force, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense,
from "participating in any way in military activities in
or over Cambodia or releasing any bombs which may
fall in Cambodia." However, the effective date of the
injunction was delayed until July 27, 1973, in order to

promptly applied for such %stay, and the application
was granted, without opinion, on July 27.2 Applicants
then filed this motion to vacate the stay. For the reasons stated below, I am unable to say that .the Court
of Appeals abused its discretion in staying the District
CoUrt's order. In view-of the complexity and impor-

tance of. the issues involved and the absence of authoritative precedent, it would be inappropriate for me, acting as a single Circuit Justice, to vacate the order of the
Court of Appeals.

* Since the facts of this dispute are on the- public recordand have- been exhaustively canvassed in the District

qpourt's opinion, it would serve no purpose to repeat
thenf in detail here. It suffices to note that publicly
acknowledged United States involvement in the Cambodian hostilities began with the President's announcement on April 30, 1970,1 that this country was launching attacks "to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on
2 At

the same time, the Court of Appeals ordered an expedited
briefing schedule and directed that the dppeal be heard .on August 13.
In the course of bral argument on the stay, Acting Chief Judge Feinberg noted that either side could submit a motion to further advance
.the date of argument. Counsel for applicants indicated during arguijent before me that he intends to file such a motion prq aptly.

Moreover, the Solicitor General has made representations that respondents will not oppose the motion and that, if it is granted, the
case could be heard by the middle of next week. This case poses
issues of the highest importance; and it is, of course, in the public
interest that those issues be resolved as expeditiously as possible.
, It appears, however, that covert American activity substantially
predated the President's April 30. announcement. See, e. g., the
New York Times, -July 15, 1973, p: 1, col. 1 ("Cambodian Raids
Reported Hidden before '70 Foray").

the Cambodian-Vietnam border," and that American
military action in that country has since met with gradually increasing congressional resistance.
Although United States ground troops had been withdrawn from the Cambodian theater by June 30, 1970,
in the summer of that year Congress enacted the socalled Fulbright Proviso prohibiting the use of funds
for military support of Cambodia.5 The following winter,
Congress re-enacted the same limitation with the added
proviso that "nothing contained in this section shall be
construed to prohibit support of actions required to insure the safe and orderly withdrawal or disengagement of
U. S. Forces from Southeast Asia, or to aid in the release
of Americans held as prisoners of war." 84 Stat. 2037.
These provisions have been attached to every subsequent
military appropriations act.6 Moreover, in the Special
Foreign Assistance Act of 1971, Congress prohibited the
use of funds to support American ground combat troops
in Cambodia under any circumstances and expressly provided that "[m]ilitary and economic assistance provided
by the United States to Cambodia ...shall not be construed as a commitment by the United States to Cambodia
'7
for its defense."
Congressional efforts to end American air activities in
Cambodia intensified after the withdrawal of American
ground troops from Vietnam and the return of American
prisoners of war. On May 10, 1973, the Hou~e of Rep4 The Situation in Southeast Asia, 6 Presidential Docuffients 596,

resentatives refused an administration request to authorize the transfer of $175 millionto cover the costs of the
Cambodian bombing. See 119, Cig: Rec. 15291, 1531715318 (1973).
Shortly thereafter, both Houses of Congress adopted the so-called Eagteton Amendment prohibiting the use of any funds for Cambodian combat
operations2 119 Cong. Rec. 17693, 21173. Although
this provision was vetoed by the President,.an amendment to the Continuing Appropriations Resolution was
ultimately adopted and signed by the Presideit into law
which stated:
"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on.
or after August 15, 1973, no funds herein or heretofore appropriated may be obligated or expended
to finance directly or indirectly combat activities

Against this background, applicants forcefully contend that continued United States military activity in
Cambodia is illegal. Specifically, they argue that the
President is constitutionally disabled in nonemergency
situations from exercising the warmaking power in the
absence of some affirmative action by Congress. See,
e. g., Bas v. Tingy, 4 Dall. 37 (1800); Talbot v. Seeman,
1 Cranch 1 (1801); Mitchell v. Laird, 159 U. S. App.
D. C. 344, 348, 488 F. 2d 611, 615 (1973); Orlando v.
Laird, 443 F. 2d 1039, 1042 (CA2 1971). Cf. Youngst mn Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S.579 (1952).
In light of the Fulbright Proviso, applicants take the
position that Congress has never given its assent for
military activity in Cambodia once American ground
troops and prisoners of war were extricated from Vietnam.
With the case in this posture, however, it is not for
me to resolve definitively the validity of applicants' legal
claims. Rather, the only issue now ripe for decision is
whether the stay ordered by the Court of Appeals should
be vacated. There is, to be sure, no doubt that I have
the power, as a single Circuit Justice, to dissolve the
stay. See Meredith v. Fair, 83 S.Ct. 10, 9 L. Ed. 2d 43
(1962) (Black, J., Circuit Justice); 28 U. S. C. §§ 1651,
2101 (f). But at the same time, the cases make clear that
this power should be exercised with the greatest ol caution
and should be reserved for exceptional 6ircumstances. Cf.
Aberdeen & Rockfish R. Co. v. SCRAP, 409 U. S.1207,
1218 (1972) (BURGER, C. J., Circuit Justice).
Unfortunately, 6nce these broad propositions are recognized, the prior cases offer litile assistance in resolving this issue, which is largely sui generis. There are,
of course, many cases suggesting that a Circuit Justice
should "balance the equities" when ruling on stay ap-

plications and determine on which side the risk of irreparable injury weighs most heavily. See, e. g., Long
Beach FederalSay. & Loan Assn. v. Federa Home Loan
Bank, 76 S. Ct. 32, 100 L. Ed. 1517 (1955) (DouGLAS, J.,
Circuit Justice); Board of Education v. Taylor, 82 S.Ct.
10 (1961) (BmixN-_N , J., Circuit Justice); Socialist Labor
Party .Rhodes, 89 S. Ct. 3, 21 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1968)
(STrwART, J., Circuit Justice).
But in this case, the problems -inherent in attempting
to strike an equitable balance between the parties are
virtually insurmountable. On the one hand, applicants
assert that if the stay is not vacated, the lives of thousands of Americans and Cambodians will be endangered
by the Executive's arguably, unconstitutional conduct..
Applicants argue, not implausibly, that if the stay is
not vacated, American pilots will be killed or captured,
Cambodian civilians will be made refugees, and the property of innocent bystanders will be destroyed.
Yet, on the other hand, respondents argue that if the'
bombing is summarily halted, important foreign policy
goals of our Government will be severely hampered. Some
may greet with considerable skepticism the claim that
vital security interests of our country rest on whether
the Air Force is permitted to continue bombing for a
few more days, particularly in light of respondents' failure.
to produce affidavits from any responsible Government
official asserting that such irreparable injury will occur. 10
But it cannot be denied that the assessment of such
injury poses the most sensitive of problems, about which ":
Justices of this Court have little or no informaoion or
expertise. While we have undoubted authority to judge

While respondents offered to produce testimony at trial by high:

the stay application were offered.

the legality of.executive action, we are on treacherous
ground indeed when we attempt judgments as to its
wisdom or necessity.11
The other standards utilized for determining the propriety of a stay are similarly inconclusive. Opinions by
Justices of this Court have frequently stated that lower
court decisions should be stayed where it is likely that
four Members of this Court would vote to grant a writ
of certiorari. See, e.-g., Edwards v. New York, 76 S. Ct.
1058, 1 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1956) (Harlan, J., Circuit Justice);
Appalachian Power Co. v. American Institute of C. P. A.,
80 S. Ct . 1.6, 4 L. Ed 2d 30 (1959) (BRENNAN, J.,'Circuit
Justice); English v. Cunningham, 80 S. Ct. 18, 4 L. Ed.
2d 42 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., Circuit justice). But to
some extent, at, least, this standard reflects a desire to
maintain the status quo in, those cases which the Court
is likely to hear on tho merits. See, e. g., In re Bart, 82
S. Ct. 675, 7 L. Ed. 2d 767 (1962) (Warren, C. J., Circuit
Justice); McGee v. Eyman, 83 S.Ct. 230,9 L. Ed. 2d 267
(1962) (DouGLAS, J., Circuit Justice). Thispcase is unusual in that regardless of what action I take, it will likely
be impossible to preserve this controversy in its present
form. for ultimate review by this Court. Cf. O'Brien v.
Brown, 409 U. S. 1, 9-10 (1972) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). On August 15, the statutory ban on Southeast
Asian military activity will take effect, and the contours
of this dispute will then be irrevocably altered. Hence,
it is difficult to justify a stay for the purpose of preserving the status quo, since no action by this Court can
freeze the issues in their present form."
"For similar reasons, it would be a formidable task to judge
,where the public interes lies in this dispute, as courts traditionally
do when determining the appropriateness of a stay. See, e. g.,
O'Brien v. Brown, 409 U. S. 1, 3 (1972).
121 do not mean to suggest that this dispute will necessarily be
moot after August 15. That is a question which is not now before

HOLTZMAN v. SCHLESINGER

1304

Opinion in Chambers

To some extent, as well, the "four-v6te" rule reflects
the policy in favor of granting a stay only when the losing
party presents substantial contentions which are likely to
prevail on the merits. See, e. g., O'Brien v. Brown, suprc;
Rosenberg v. United States, 346 U. S. 273, 313 (195;)
(DOUGLAS, J., Circuit Justice); Railway Express Agenc.y
v. United States, 82 S. Ct."466, 7 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1962)
(Harlan, J., Circuit Justice); Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.
v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 396 U. S, 1201
(1969) (Black, J., Circuit Justice). - In my judgment,
applicants' contentions in this case ,are far from frivolous
and may well ultimately prevail. Although tactical
decisions as to the conduct of an ongoing war may present
political questions which the federal courts lack jurisdiction to decide, see, e. -g., DaCosta v. Laird, 471 F. 2d,1144
(CA2 1973), and although the courts may lack the power
to dictate the form which congressional assent to warmaking must take, see, e. g., Massachusettsv. Laird, 451 F. 2d
26 (CAl 1971); Mitchell v. Laird, 159 U. S. App. D. C.
344, 488 F, 2d 611 (1973), there is a respectable and growing body of lower court opinion holding that Art:tI, (§ S,
cl. 11, imposes some judicially manageable standaidsas('t
congressional authorization for warmaking, and that these
standards are sufficient to make controversies concerning them justiciable. See Mitchell v. Laird, supra;
DaCosta v. Laird, supra; Orlando v. Laird, 443-F. 2d
1039 (CA2 1971); Berk v; Laird, 429 F. 2d 302 ,(CA2
1970).

Similarly, as a matter bf substantive constitutio'nal
law, it seems likely that the President may not wage
war without some-form of congressional approval-except, perhaps, in the case -of-apressing emergency or when
me and upon which I express no Views. Moreover, even if-.the
August 15 fund cutoff does -moot this cantroversy, applicants may

nonetheless be able to secure a Court of AifpeAls determination on
the merits before August 15.

See n. 2, supra. ,

1312

OCTOBER TERM, 1973

the President is inthe process of extricting himself from
a war which Congress once authorized. At the very beginning of our history, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall wrote
for a unanimous Court that:
"The whole powers of war being, by the constitution of the United States, vested in congress, the
acts of that body 'can alone be resorted to as our
guides in this enquiry. It is not denied . . . that
congress may authorize general hostilities, in which
case the general laws of war apply -to our situation;
or partial hostilities, in which case the laws of war,
so far as they actually apply to our situation,
must be noticed." Talbot v. Seeman, 1 Cranch 1,

28 (1801).
In my judgment, nothing in the 172 years since those
words were written alters that fundamental constitutional
postulate. Cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U. S. 579 (1952).
A fair reading of Congress' actions concerning the war
in Cambodia may well indicate that the Legislature has
authorized only "partial hostilities"-that it has never
given its approval to the war except to the extent that
it was. necessary to extricate American troops and prisoners from Vietnam. Certainly, this seems to be the
thrust of the Fulbright Proviso. 3 Moreover, this Court
'" The Solicitor General vigorously argues that by directing that
Cambodian operations cease on August 15, Congress implicitly authorized their continuation until that date. But while the issue is
not wholly free from doubt, it seems relatively plain from the face
of the statute that Congress directed its attention solely to military
actions after August 15, while expressing no view on the propriety
of- ongoing operations prior to that date. This conclusion gains
plausibility from the remarks of the sponsor of the provisionSenator Fulbrijgt-on the Senate floor:
'The acceptance of an August 15 cutoff date should in,no way
be interpreted as recognition by the committee of the President's

HOLTZMAN v. SCHLESINGER

Opinion in Chambers

could easily conclude that after the Paris Peace Accords,
the Cambodian bombing is no longer justifiable as an
extension of the war which Congress did authorize and
that the bombing is no.t required by the type of pressing

emergency which necessitates immediate presidential
response.

Thus, if the decision were mine alone, I might well
conclude on the merits that continued American military
operations in Cambodia are unconstitutional. But the

Supreme Court is a collegial institution, and its decisions
reflect the views of a majority of the sitting Justices.
It follows that when I sit in my capacity as a Circuit
Justice, I act not for myself alone but as a surrogate for
the entire Court, from whence my ultimate authority in

these matters derives.

A Circuit Justice therefore I bears
..

a heavy'responsibility to conscientiously reflect the views
of his Brethren as best he perceives them, cf. Meredith v.

Fair,83 S. Ct. 10, 11, 9 L. Ed. 2d 43,44-45 (1962) (Black,
J., Circuit Justice), and this responsibility is particularly
pressing when, as now, the Court is not in session.

When the problem is viewed from this perspective it
is immeasurably complicated. It must be recognized
that we are writing on an almost entirely clean slate in

this area.

The stark fact is that although there have

authority to engage U. S. forces in hostilities until that date. The
view of most members of the committee has been and continues to
be that the President does not have such authority in the absence
of specific congressional approval." 119 Cong. Rec. 22305 (1973).
See also id., at 22307.
While it is true that some Senators declined to vote for the proposal because of their view that it did implicitly authorize continuation of the war until August 15, see id., at 22313 (remarks of Sen.
Eagleton); 22309 (remark, of Sen. Bali); -22317 (remarks of
Sen. Muskie), it is well established that speeches by opponents -of
legislation are entitled to r~latively little weight in determining the
meaning of the Act in question.

been numerous .lower court decisions concerning the legality of,the war in Southeast Asia, this Corni. has never
considered the problem, and it cannot be doubted that
the issues posed are immensely important and complex.
The problem is further complicated by the July 1, 1973,
amendment to the Continuing Appropriations Resolution providing that "on or after August 15, 1973, no
funds herein or heretofore appropriated may be obligated
or expended to -finance directly or indirectly combat
activities by United States military forces in or over or
from off the shores of North Vietnam, South Vietnam,
Laos or Cambodia." 87 Stat. 134. This, it is urged, is
the crux of this case and there is neither precedent nor
guidelines toward any definitive conclusion as to whether
this is or is not sufficient to order the bombings to be
halted prior to August 15.
Lurking in this suit are questions of standing, juidicial
competence, and substantive constitutional law which
go to the roots of the division of power in a constitutiortal
democracy. These are the sort of issues which should
not be decided precipitately or without the benefit of
proper consultation. It should be noted, moreover, that
since the stay below was gr~nted in respondents' favor,
the issue here is not whether there is some possibility that
applicants will prevail on the merits, but rather whether
there is some possibility that respondents will so prevail.
In light of the uncharted and complex nature of the
problem, I am ,unwilling to say that that possibility is
nonexistent.
Finally, it is significant that although I cannot know
with certainty what conclusion my Brethren would reach,
I do have the views of a distinguished panel of the Court
of Appeals before me. That panel carefully considered
the issues presented and unanimously concluded that a
stay .was appropriate. Its decision, taken in aid of its
own jurisdiction, is entitled to great weight. See, e. g.,

United States ex rel. Knauff v. McGrath (unreported

(Jackson, J., Circuit Justice)-; Breswick & Co. v. United
States, 75 S. Ct. 912, 100 L. Ed. 1510 (1955) (Harlan, J.,
Circuit Justice). In light of the complexity and'importance of the issues posed, I cannot say that the Court of
Appeals abused its discretion.
When the final history of the Cambodian war is'
written, it is unlikely to make pleasant reading. The decision to send American troops "to distant lands to die
of foreign fevers and foreigh shot and shell," New York
Times Co. v. Uhited States, 403 U. S. 713, 717 (1971)
(Black, J., concurring), may ultimately -be. adjudged to
have been not only unwise but also unlawful.
But the proper resjponse tp an arguably illegal action
is not lawlessness by judges charged with, interpreting
and enforciiig the laws. D6wn that road lies tyranny
and epression. We have a government, of limited
powers, 'and those limits pertain to the Justices of 'this
Court. as. well as to Congress and the.Executive. Our
Constitution assures that the law will ultimately prevail,
butit also requires that the law be applied in accordance
with lawful procedures.
III staying the judgment of the District Court, the
Court of Appeals agreed to hear the appeal 6n its merits
on AuguzL 13 and advised applicants to apply to that
panel for an earlier hearing before that date. It. is.
therefore, clear to me that this highly controversial constitutional question involvinig the other two branches of
this Government must follow the regular appellate procedures on the accelerated schedule as suggested by the
Court of Appeals.
In my judgment, I would exceed my legal wthority
were I, acting alone, to grant this application. The application to vacate the stay entered below must therefore be
Denied.
