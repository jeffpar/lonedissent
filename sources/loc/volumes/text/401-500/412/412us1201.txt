NAVY, ET AL.
ON APPLICATION TO VACATE ORDERS STAYING DISTRICT COURT
JUDGMENT PENDING DISPOSITION OF CASE
BY COURT OF APPEALS

No. A-1124. Decided May 18, 1973
1.Application to vacate Court of Appeals' stay of District. Court's
order in habeas corpus proceeding denied, Solicitor General having
represented that applicants have been released and no uncounseled
persons summarily court-martialed are inmilitary confinement in
Central
'District of California.
2. Question
of District Court's authority to grant habeas corpus
relief for unnamed class members outside District and/or on worldwide basis is so novel that relief should be granted only after full
argument.
MR.JUSTICE DOUGLAs, Circuit Justice.

The application for an order vacating the stay of the
Court of Appeals is denied on the representation of the
Solicitor General that the named applicants in the case
have all been released from confinement and that: within
the Central District of California no persons are currently confined in any military detention facility as a
result of a conviction by summary court-martial without
the aid of counsel. Whether the District Court has
authority to issue a writ of habeas corpus for unnamed
members of the class outside the District and/or on a
worldwide basis is so novel a question that an order
granting such relief should be issued only after full
argument. Application denied.
