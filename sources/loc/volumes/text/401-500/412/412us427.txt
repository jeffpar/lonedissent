NORTHCROSS ET A. v. BOARD OF EDUCATION
OF THE MEMPHIS CITY SCHOOLS ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE- UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT

No. 72-1164.' Decided June'4, 1973
Since the Court of Appe als' denial of costs and attorneys' fees under
§ 718 of the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972 to petitioners, who
were successful in litigation -aimed at desegregating the public
schools of Memph s, Tenn., was without'stated reasons, this Court
cannot determine whether the prqper standard, Newman v. Piggie
Park Enterp2es, Inc., 390 U. S. 400, was correctly applied.
Certiorari granted; .vacated and remanded.
_'PER CUsiAM.

This case presents the question of the propriety, under
§ 718 of the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, 86 Stat.
369,20 U. S. C. § 1617, of a denial of attorneys' fees to the
successful-plaintiffs in this litigation aimed at desegregating the public schools of Memphis, Tennessee. Section
718, vhich became effective on July 1,"1972, provides that
"[u]pon the entry of a final order by~a court of the
United States against a local educational agen6y;a State
(or any agency thereof), or the United States. (or-any
agency thereof)," in any action seeking to redress illegal
or unconstitutional discrimination with respect to "elementary and secondary education, the court, in its discretion, upon a finding that the. proceedings were iecessary
to bring about cgmpliance, may alloy. t e prevailing
'party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs." In this case, the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 'Circuit denied
petitioners', motion for an award of attorneys' fees.
The Court of Appeals did not, however, state reasons
for the denial and it is therefore not possible, for this

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

412 U. S.

Court to determine whether the Court of Appeals applied
the proper standard in reaching this result.,
Section 718 tracks the wording of § 204 (b) of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 244, 42 U. S. C. § 2000a-3(b),
which provides that, in an action seeking to enforce Title
II of that Act, "the court, in its discretion, may allow the
prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee. as part of the costs . . . ." In
Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 390 U. S. 400
(1968), we held, that, under § 204 (b), "one who. succeeds
in obtaining an injunction under that Title should ordinarily recover an attorney's fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust." Id.,
at 402. The similarity of language in § 718 and § 204 (b)
is, of course, a strong indication that the two statutes
should be interpreted pari passu. Moreover, "the two
provisions share a common raison dg'tre. The plaintiffs
in school cases are 'private attorneys general' vindicating
national policy in the same sense as are plaintiffs in
T4tle II actions. The enactment of both provisions was
for the same purpose--'to encourage individuals injured
by racial discrimination' to seek- judicial relief .'. ... '
Johnson v. Combs,-471 F.'2d-84, 86';(CA5 1972), quoting Newman,v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., supra, at
402. We tierefor6 conclude that, As with §.204 (b), if
other requirements of § 718 are satisfied, the successful
plaintiff "should ordinarily reco- er an .attorney's fee-unless special circumstances would render such an award
unjust." 390 U. S., at 402. Since it is impossible for us
IRespondents suggest that petitioners' motion for costs and attorneys' fees might have been denied due to untimeliness. Although-it
is clear that the petitions for rehearing en bane were denied as
untimely, there is no! indication that the bill of costs was filed out
of time, or that 'costs and attorneys' fees were denied for that
reason.

NORTHCROSS v. MEMPHIS BOARD OF EDUCATION 429

Per Curiam

to determine whether the Court of Appeals applied this
standard and, if so, whether it did so correctly, we grant
the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment below
insofar as it relates to the denial of attorneys' fees,and remand to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.2 See Taylor v. McKeithen, 407 U. S. 191 (1972); of. Californi,, v. Krivda,
409 U. S. 33 (1972).
- MR. JusTIcE MA sBALL did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.

2We need not, and therefore' do not, decide whether § 718 authorizes
an award of attorneys' fees insofar as those expenses were incurred
prior to the date that that section came into effect. We also do not
decide whether, and 'under what circumstances, an award of attor-.
neys' fees is permissible in suits brought under 42 U. S. C..§ 1983 in
the absence of specific ptatutory authorization for sich an award.
