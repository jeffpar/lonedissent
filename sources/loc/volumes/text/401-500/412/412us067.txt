rl. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The question presented in this case is whether the
National Labor Relations Board is required by § 8 (b)
(1) (A)- of the National Labor Relations Act' to inquire
into the reasonableness of a disciplinary fine imposed by
a union upon a member when the Board exercises its admitted authority under that section to determine whetherthe fine otherwise constitutes an unfair labor'practice.
The Board held that the validity of union fines under
the Act does not depend on their being reasonable in
amount. Booster Lodge No. 405, 185 N. L. R. B. 380,
383 n. 16, 75 L. R. R. M. 1004, 1007 n. 16 (1970). On
petition for judicial review of this determination, ,the
Court of Appeals held that an unreasonably large fine is
-coercive and restraining within the meaning.of § 8 (b) (1)

Opinion of the Court

Michoud plant in New Orleans and at other locations.
As ofOctober 2, 1965, the parties signed a new collectivebargaining agreement and the strikers thereafter returned
to Work. -Both agreements contained maintenance-ofmembership clauses that required Union members to retain their membership during the contract term. New
employees were required to notify the Union and the
Company within 40 days of accepting employment if .they
elected not to join the Union.
During the 18-day strike some 143 employees out of
1,900 production and maintenance employees in the bargaining unit at the Michoud plant crossed the picket
lines and returned to work. All of these employees were
Union members at the time the strike began, although
some of them tendered their resignations either before or
after crossing the picket lines.2 In late October or early
November 1965 the Union notified these employees that
charges had been preferred against them for violating
the International Union's constitution. The constitution provides penalties for the "improper conduct of a
member,' which term includes "[a]ecepting employment.., in an establishment where a strike ... exists."
In accordance with appropriate union' procedures,'-including notice and 'opportunity for a hearing, all strikebreakers were found, guilty, fined $450, and barredfrom
holding Union office for a period of five years.' While

Opinion 6f the" C6urt

412 U. S.

U. S. 423 (1969). In Allis-Chatmers we held that court
enforcement of fines ranging from $20 to $100 for crossing
picket lines did not "restrain or coerce" employees within
the meaning, of the Act. And in &ofield we held that
the union did not violate the' Act in imposing fines of
$50 and $100 on members for violating a union rule
relating to production ceilingsIn deciding these cases, the Court several times referred to the unions' imposition of "reasonable" fines.,
In particular, the Scofield Court' concluded "that. the
union rule-is valid and that its enforcement by reasonable
fines does not constit.te the restraint or coercion pro-.
scribed by § 8 (b) (1) (A)." 394. U. S.; at 436 (emphasis
added). The Company contends, not, illogically, that
the Court's use of the adjective "reasonable" was intended to suggest to the Board that an unreasonable fine.
would amount to an unfair labor practice.
This interpretation, however, permissible as it may be,
is only dicta, since in both Alis-Chalmers and in Scofield
the reasonableness of the fines was assumed. 388 U. S.,
at 192-193, n, 30; 394 U. S., at 430.7 Being squarely
.presented with the issue in this case, we recede from the
implications. of the dicta in these earlier cases. While
7Moreover, since the Board has consistently over a long period
-of time interpreted the Act as not giving it authority to examine
the reasonableness of disciplinary fines, infra, at 74-75, it is not likely
that the Court specificially intended, by the use of a single adjective,
and without mentioning the Labor- Board cases to the contrary, to
overturn the Board's interpretation of the Act. Nor can it be
-argued that the Court was unaware of the Board's interpretation,
for the Scofield Court stated that in Allis-Chalmers it
"essentially accepted the position, of the National Labor Rilations
Board dating from Minneapoli Star & Tribune Co., 109 N. L. R. B.
727 (1954) where the Board also distinguished internal from external
enforcement in. holding that a union could fine a member for his
failure to take part in picketing during a strike .... " Sc6field v.
NLRB, 394 U. S. 423, 428 (1969).

NLRB v. BOEING CO.
67

Opinion of the Court

"unreasonable" fines may be more coercive than "reasonable" fines, all fines are coercive to a greater or lesser
degree. The underlying basis for the holdings of AllisChalmers and Scofield was not that reasonable fines were
noncoercive under the language of § 8 (b) (1) (A) of
the Act, but was instead that those provisions were not
intended by Congress to apply to the imposition by the
union of fines not affecting the employer-employee relationship and not otherwise prohibited by the Act. The
reason for this determination, in turn, was that Congress had not intended by enacting this section to regulate the internal affairs of unions to the extent that
would be required in order to base unfair labor practice
charges on the levying of such fines.
The Court's examination of the legislative history of
this provision in Allis-Chalmers led to the conclusion
that:
"What legislative materials there are dealing with
§ 8 (b) (1) (A) contain not a single word referring
to the application of its prohibitions to traditional
internal union dicipline in general, or disciplinary
fines in particular. On the contrary there are a
number of assurances by its sponsors that the section was not -meant to regulate the internal affairs
of unions." 388 U. S., at 185-186 (emphasis
added).8
In Scofield we decided that Congress intended to distinguish between the external and the internal enforcement of union rules, and that therefore the Board would
"As we also noted in Alis-Chalmers, this interpretation is'
supported by the Landrum-Griffin Act, where "Congress expressly recognized that a union member may be 'fined, suspended, expelled,
or otherwise disciplined,' -and enacted only procedurai .,requirements
to be observed. 73 Stat. 523, 29 U. S. C. § 41"1 (a) (5) " NLRB v.

have authority to pass on those rules affectihg an individual's employment status but not on his union
membership status. 394 U. S., at 428-430.
Inquiry by the Board into the multiplicity of factors
that the parties and the Court of Appeals correctly
thought to have a bearing on the issue of reasonableness
would necessarily lead the Board to a substantial involvement in strictly internal union affairs. While the
line may not always be clear between those matters that
are internal and those' that are external, to the extent
that the Board was required to examine into such questions as a union's .motivation for imposing a fine it
would be delving into internal union affairs in a manner
which we have previously held Congress did not intend.
Given the rationale of Allis-Chalmers and cofield, the
Board's conclusion that § 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Act has
nothing to say about union fines of this nature, whatever
their size, is correct. Issues as to the reasonableness or
unreasonableness of such fines must be decided upon
the basis of the law of contracts, voluntary associations,
or such other principles of law as may be applied in a
forum competent to adjudicate the issue. Under our
holding, state courts will be wholly free to apply state
law to such issues at the suit of either the union or the
member fined.
Our conclusion is also supported by the Board's longstanding administrative construction to the same effect.
-At least since 1954, it has been the Board's consistent
position that it has "not been empowered by Congress . . . to pass judgment on the penalties a union
may impose on a niember sd long as the penalty does not

Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co., 109 N. L. R. B. 727,

with its enforcement is entitledto great deference by the
courts. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424, 433434 (1971); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U. S. 1,16 (1965).11
The Court of Appeals and the Company have suggested several policy reasons why the Board should not
leave the determinations of reasonableness entirely to the
state courts. Their basic reasons are, first, that more
uniformity in the determination of what is reasonable
will result if 'the Board suggests standards and, second,
that more expertise in labor matters will be brought to
bear if the issue is decided by the Board rather than solely
by the courts.- Even if we were to concede the relevance
of policy factors in determining congressional intent, we
are not persuaded that the Board is necessarily the better
forum for determining the reasonableness of a fine.
As we noted in Allis-Chalmers, court enforcement of
union fines is not a recent innovation but has been known
at least since 1867. 388 U. S., at 182 n. 9. See also

local law of contracts or voluntary associations usually
governs the enforcement of this relationship. NLRB
v. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,- 388 U. S., at 182 and 193
n. 32; Scofield v. NLRB, supra, at 426 n. 3.

We alluded to state court enforcement of unusually
harsfi union discipline in AUis-Chalmers when we stated
that "state courts, in reviewing the imposition of union

discipline, find ways th strike down 'discipline [which]
involves'a severe hardship."' 388 U. S., at 193 n. 32,
quoting Summers, Legal Limitations on Union Discipline, 64 Harv. L. Rev. 1049, 1078 (1951). The Board
assumed that in view of this statement, our reference to
"reasonable" fines, when reasonableness was not in issue,
in Allis-Chalmers and in S&ofield, was merely adverting

to the usual standard applied by state courts in deciding
whether to enforce union-imposed fines. The Board
reads these cases, there-ore, as encouraging state courts
to us6 a reasonableness standard, not as a directive to
the Board.1
Our review of state court cases decided both before and
after our decisions in Allis-Chalmers and Scofield reveals

-that-state courts applying state law are quite willing to
determine whether disciplinary fines are reasonable in

"Thus, the Court's findings that the fines in those cases were

mination of reasonableness may well be more evident in
a judicial forum that is called upon to assess reasonableness in varying factual contexts than it is in a specialized
agency. In assessing the reasonableness of disciplinary
fines, for example, state courts are often able to draw on
their experience in areas of the law apart from labor
relations.2
Nor is it clear, as contended by the Court of Appeals,
that the Board's setting of standards of reasonableness
will necessarily result in greater uniformity in this area
even if uniformity is thought to be a desirable goal.
Since state courts will have jurisdiction to determine

reasonableness in the enforcement context in any event,
the Board's independent determination of reasonableness
in an unfair labor practice context might 'well yield a

rules to an oppressive and coercive device of retribution,
a weapon which, when used to extremes, may deprive a
working man of his very means of sustenance. Whether
a particular fine is required in a particular situation involves a weighing of the delicate balance of relations between the employers, employees, and the union involved.
Such an intimate knowledge of labor relations has consistently been ascribed to the Board, often by the unions.
It is the Board that deals with such matters on a daily
basis. It is the Board that has the jurisdiction and
experience to devise and employ national standards to
govern union conduct; there are valid reasons for essential uniformity and consistency in the matters of fines.
To isolate this sensitive subject and thrust it on.the state
courts is contrary to the entire *history of the federal
labor statutes and opens the door to a wide disparity of
fines for the same conduct in different States.

turned to work; 58 resigned during the course of the
strike, but after they had crossed the picket line. Allof these resignations were submitted after the expiration
of the 1963-1965 collective agreement. The Union never
warned members on this or on earlier occasions, chat
disciplinary measures could or would be taken against
members who crossed the picket line.
After the new collective agreement was reached, the
Union notified all members who had crossed the picket
line to work during the strike that charges had been laid
against them and that they would be tried by the Union
for "improper" conduct, the Union's constitution permitting disciplinary measures, including "reprimand, fine,
suspension and/or expulsion from membership, or any

strike; and the prohibition against holding Union office
was reduced in those cases.
The Union sent out a written notice saying that the unpaid fines had been referred to an attorney for collection
and that the reduced fines would be restored to $450 if
not paid. Suits against nine employees were filed in a
state court to collect the fines plus attorneys' fees and
interest; and tbey-are unresolved.
Boeing filed a charge of an unfair labor practice against
the Union under § 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Act.* The Gen*That section provides:
"(b) It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization

DouGLKs, J., dissenting

eral Counsel issued a complaint and the Board decided
that the Union had violated § 8 (b) (1) (A) except for the
fines on members for crossing the picket line to work and
for the fines on those who resigned after returning to
work during the strike, for work performed during the
strike prior to their resignations. But the Board, one
member dissenting. refused to pass on th&reasonableness
of the fines, holding it lacked the power to do so
The unfair labor practice under § 8 (b) (1) (A) is the
action of a union "to restrain or coerce" an employee from
the "right to refrain from" assisting a union as that
right is defined in § 7. In Scofield v. NLRB, 394 U
.
423, we upheld a union rule and concluded "that its
enforcement by reasonable fines does not constitute th6
restraint or coercion proscribed by § 8 (b) (1) (A)." id.,
at 436 (emphasis added). See also NLRB.v. AllisChalmers Mfg. Co., .388 U. S. 175. The imposition of a
nominal fine of $1 might suit the circumstances of a case,
where a $1,000 fine would be monstrous. A nominal fine
might be justified where, as here, the employeei had no
warning that they would or could be fined for working behind a picket line. A fine where the only sanction would
be temporary suspension from the union might be "reasonable," yet unreasonable if it was court enforceable,
meaning, as it does here, that attorneys' fees, costs,
with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein."
61 Stat. 141, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (b) (1) (A).
Section 7 provides:
"Employees shall have th- right to self-organization, to form, join,
or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted
activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual
aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any
or all of such activities except to the extent that such right way be
affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a cQndition of employment as authorized in section 8 (a) (3)."

DOUGLAS, J., dissenting

and interest may be added.

412 U. S.

A member who must

pay the union's attorney as well as his own if he
challenges the reasonableness of a fine in a state court
and loses, may well be suffering an unconscionable
penalty. Moreover, the fine may be imposed by a union
which believed as did the present Union that the member
had no "right" to resign, though NLRB v. Textile
Workers, 409 U. S. 213, held to the contrary. The present fines seem to be swollen. by that predilection of
the Union. The present fines also exceed the earnings of the workers during the strike period. By what
standard can that possibly be, justified? 'As member
McCulloch of the Board, dissenting, said, the excess
of the fines over the wages collected during this period
is in actual effect an assessment after the strike is over.
If after the strike the Union caused Boeing to suspend a,
member without pay after the strike because he had
worked during the strike, there could be no question but
'that the Union violated § 8 (b) (1) (A). Yet, the assessment of fines greater than the wages earned during the
strike has precisely that effect. Thus, in assessing an
unreasonable fine the Union, in .my view, goes beyond
the permissible bounds of regulating its internal affairs.
It is no answer to say that the reaionableness of a
fine may be tested in a state-court suit. That envisages
a rich and powerful. union suing a rich and powerful
employee. Employees, however, are often at the bottom
of the totem pole, without financial resources, and unworldly when it comes to litigation. 'Suc]h a suit is likely
to be no contest. The Board procedures, on the other
hand, may be readily available. If an employee files a
charge with any merit, the Regional Director will issue a
complaint. Thereafter, the General Counsel represents
the employee, and the agency b ars any cost of prosecuting the claim.

DouGLAs, J,., dissenting

But my difficulty vith the Court's decision iseven
greater. State judges though honest and competent,
have no expertise in labor-management relations. The
Board does have that expertise and cin evolve guidelines based on its broad experience. It is said that Congress has provided the Board with no guidelines for passing on the "reasonableness" of union-imposed fines.; But
the Board through case-by-case treatment has been developing an administrative common law concerning "unfair" practices of employers and unions alike. We have
said on other occasions that the "experience and commonsense" which are facets of the expertise of the Board,
NLRB v. Radio & Television Broadcast Engineers, 364
U. S. 573, 582-583, are adequate for the difficult and
delicate responsibilities which Congress has entrustedto it, subject of course to judicial review. A fine discretely related to a legitimate union need and reflecting principled motivations under the law is one thing:
A fine that reflects the raw power exercised by a union
in its hunger for all-pervasive authority, over members
is quite another problem. The Labor Board, -which
knows the nuances of this problem better than any other
tribunal, is the keeper of the conscience under the Act.
It and it alone has primary responsibility to police unions,
as well as .employers, in protection of the rights of workers. In my view it cannot properly perform its duties
under § 8(b)(1) (A) unless it determines whether the
nature and amount of the fine levied by a union constitute an unfair labor practice.
