UNITED STATES v. BISHOP
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT Or APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT

No. 71-1698. Argued January 16, 1973-Decided May 29, 1973
Respondent was convicted of violating 26 U. S. C. § 7206 (1), which
makes it a felony when one "[w]ilfully makes and subscribes any
return . .. which he does not believe to be true and correct as
to every material matter," after the District Court refused a lesser"mluded-offense jury- charge under § 7207, which makes it a-misdemeanor when one "willfully delivers or discloses" to the Internal
Revenue Service any return or document "known by him to be
fraudulent or to be false as to any material matter." The Court
of Appeals reversed -on the ground that "willfully" as used in
§ 7206 implied an evil motiVe and bad faith, but the same word
as used in § 7207 required only a showing of, unreasonable, capricious, or careless disregard for the truth. Held: The word "willfully" has the same meaning in §§ 7206 (1) and 7207, connoting
the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty, and the
distinction between the statutes is found in the additional misconduct that is essential to the violation of the felony provision;
hence, the District Court properly refused the requested lesserincluded-offense instruction based on respondent's erroneous con-'
tention that the word "willfully" in the misdemeanor statute
implied lesi scienter than the same word in the felony statute.

MR.JUSTICE BLACxmUN delivered the opinion of the

Court.
Chapter 75, subchapter A, of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U. S. C. §§ 7201-7241, is
concerned with tax crimes. Sections 7201-7207, inclusive, which in the aggregate relate to attempts to evade
or defeat tax, to failures to act, and to fraud, all include
the word "willfully" in their respective contexts. Specifically, § 7206 ig'a felony statute and reads:
"§ 7206. Fraud and false statements.
"Ayperson who"(1) Declaration under penalties of perjury.
'"Willfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other docurment, which contains or is veriied by a written declaration that it is made under
the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and' correct as to every material
matter ....
"shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined not more than $5,000; or imprisoned not more than'3 years, or both, together
with the costs of prosecution."
Section 7207 is a misdemeanor statute I and reads:
"7207. Fraudulent returns, statements, or other
documents.
Title 18 U. S. C. § 1 defines felony and misdemeanor:
"§ 1. Offenses classified.
"Notwithstanding any Act of Congress to the contrary:
"(1) Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term
exceeding one year is a felony.
"(2) Any other'offense is a misdemeanor."

OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion of the Court

412 U. S.

"Any person who willfully delivers or discloses to

the Secretary or his delegate any list, return, account, statement, or other document, known by him
to be fraudulent or to be false as to any material

matter, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both."

This case presents the issue of the meaning of the
critical word "willfully" as it is employed in these two
successive statutes. Is its meaning the same in each,
or is the willfulness specified by the misdemeanor statute,
§ 7207, -of somewhat less degree than the felony willfulness specified by § 7206?

I.

Respondent, Cecil J. Bishop, was convicted by a jury
on all three counts of an indictment charging huna with
felony violations of § 7206 (1) with respect to his federal
income tax returns for the calendar years 1963, 1964, and
1965. The Court of Appeals, holding that a lesser-included-offense instruction directed to the misdemeanor
statuta, § 7207, was improperly refused by the trial judge,
reversed the judgment of the District Court and remanded the case for a new trial. 455 F. 2d 612 (CA9
1972). Since the meaning of "willfully," as used in the

tax crime statutes, has divided the circuits,2 we granted
certiorari.

Opinion of the Court

We conclude that it was proper and correct for the
District Court to refuse the lesser-included-offense instruction. In our view, the word "willfully" has the same
meaning in both statutes. Consequently, we reverse and
remand so that the Court of Appeals may now proceed
to consider the additional issues that court found it unnecessary to reach.
II
Mr. Bishop is a lawyer who has practiced his profession
in Sacramento, California, since 1951. During that period, he owned an interest in a walnut ranch he and his
father operated. In 1960 his secretary, Louise, married
his father. The father died, and thereafter respondent's
stepmother managed the ranch.
Respondent periodically sent-checks to Louise. These
were used to run the ranch, to pay principal on loans,
and to make improvements.
Louise maintained a record of ranch expenditures and
submitted an itemized list of these disbursements to respondent at the tnd of each calendar year. In his 1963
return respondent asserted as business deductions all
amounts paid to Louise and, in addition, all the expenses
Louise listed. This necessarily resulted in a double deduction for all ranch expenditures in 1963. Moreover,
some of these expenditures- were for repayment of loans
and for other personal items that did not qualify as income tax deductions. In his 1964 and 1965 returns
respondent similarly included nondeductible amounts
among the ranch figures that were deducted.
The aggregate amount of improper deductions taken
by respondent for the three taxable years exceeded
7203)'; Escobar v. United State3, 388 F. 2d 661 (CA5 1967), cert.
deried, 390 U. S.1024 (1968) (§§ 7206 (1) and 7207). Other inconsistendies in interpreting the word "willfully" have compounded the
confusion. See n. 8, infra. Cf. United States v. Lachmann, 469
F. 2d -1043 (CA1 1972) (§§ 7201 and 7203).

$45,000. He enjoyed aggregate gross income for those
years of about $70,000.
The incorrectness of the returns as filed for the three
years was not disputed at trial. Transcript of Trial 869872, 1148. Neither is it disputedhere. Brief for Respondent 4.
It
Section 7206 (1), the felony statute, is violated when
one "[w]illfully makes and subscribes any return," under
penalties of perjury, "which he does not believe to be
true and correct as to every material matter." Respondent based his defense at trial on the ground that he was
not aware of the double deductions asserted in 1963 or
of the improper deductions taken in the three taxable
years. He claimed that his law office secretary prepared
the return schedules from his records and from the information furnished by Louise; he merely failed to check
the returns for accuracy '
Respondent requested lesser-included-offense instructions based on the misdemeanor statute, § 7207. This
tax misdemeanor is committed by one "who 'willfully
delivers or discloses" to the Internal Revenue Service
any return or document 'known by him to be fraudulent
or to be false as to any material matter." Respondent
argued that the word "willfully" in the misdemeanor
'statute should be construed to require less scienter than
the same word in the felony- statute. App. 28. With
the state of respondent's guilty knowledge in-dispute, his
prbposed 'instructions would have allowed the jury to
choose between a misdemeanor based on caprice or careless disregard and a felony requiring evil purpose. The.
trial judge declined to, give the requested instructions
and, instead, gave an instruction only on the felony, requiring a finding by the jury that the defendnt intended

"with evil motive or bad purpose either to disobey or to
disregard the law." App. 24.
After the guilty verdict on all counts was returned,
respondent was sentenced to two years' imprisonment on
each count, the sentences to run concurrently. The
court, however, suspended all but 90 days of each sentence
and placed respondent on probation for five years on condition that he pay a fine of $5,000. App: 31.

IV
The Court of 4ppeals relied upon and followed, 455
F. 2d, at 614, a series of its own cases,3 particularly Abdul
v. United States, 254 F. 2d 292 (1958), enunciating the
proposition that the word "willfully" -has -a meaning in
tax felony statutes that is more stringent than its meaning in tax misdemeanor statutes.4 Our examination of
these Ninth Circuit precedents in the light of this Court's
decisions leads us to conclude that the Qourt of Appeals' opinion cannot be sustained by this asserted distinction between 9 7206 (1) and § 7207.
A. The Ninth Circuit rule appears to have been evolved
from lan'guage in this Court's opinion iii Spies v. United
States, 317 U. S. 492 (1943). In Spies the defendant requested an instruction to the effect that an affirmative
act was necessary to constitute a willful attempt to evade
or defeat a tax, within the meaning of § 145 (b) of .the
Revenue Act of' 1936, 49 Stat. 1703. The. trial court

States, 409 F. 2d 228 (1969) (§ 7203); Edwards v. United States,
375 F. 2d 862 (1967) (§§ 7201, 7203, and 7206 (2)); Martin v.
United States, n. 2, supra; Abdul'v. United States, n. 2, supra.
4One possible result of this distinction, of course, is that the Government's burden in a misdemeanor case could be lew than in a
felony case.

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

Opinion of the Court

refused the request. The Second Circuit affirmed. This
Court reversed. We were concerned in Spies with a
felony statute, § 145 (b)j applying to one "who willfully.
attempts in any manner to evade'or defeat any tax,"
and with a companion misdemeanor statute, § 145 (a),
applying to one who "willfully fails to pay such tax, make
such return, keep such records, or supply suchinformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations."
These statutes were the predecessors of the current
§§ 7201 and 7203, respectively, of the 1954 Code. In
distinguishing between the two offenses, the Court said:
"The difference between willful failure to pay a
tax when due, which is made a misdemeanor and
willful attempt to defeat and evade one, which is
made a felony,.is not easy to detect or define. Both
must be willful, and willful, as we have said, is a
word of many meanings, its construction often being
influenced by its context. United States v. Murdock, .290 U. S. 389.. It may well mean something
more as applied to nonpayment of a tax than when
applied to failure to make a return. Mere voluntary
and. purposeful, as distinguished from accidental,
omission to make a timely return might meet the
'test of willfulness. But in view of our traditional
aversion to imprisonment for debt, we would not
without the clearest manifestation of Congressional
intent assume' that mere knowing and irtentiona.l
default Miipayment of a tax, where there had been
no willful failure to disclose, the liability, is intended
to constitute a criminal offense of any degree. "We
would expect willfulness in such a case to include
some element of evil motive and want of justification in view of all the financial circumstances of the
taxpayer.
"Had § 145 (a) not included willful failure to pay
a tax, it would have defined as misdemeanors gen-

Opinion of the Court

erally a failure to observe statutory duties to make
timely returns, keep records, or supply informationduties imposed to facilitate administration of the
Act even if, because of insufficient net income, there
were no duty to pay a tax. It would then be a
permissible and perhaps an appropriate construction of § 145 (b) that it made felonies of the same
willful omissions when there was the added element
of duty to pay a tax. The definition of such nonpayment as a misdemeanor, we think, argues strongly
against 'such, an interpretation." "a17 U. S., at
497-498.
In Abdul the court considered an appeal by a taxpayer
convicted of tax misdemeanors (§ 2707 (b) of the 1939
Code and § 7203 of the 1954 Code) based on"failure to
file but~acquitted of tax felonie' (§ 2707 (c) of the 1939
Code and § 7202 of the 1954 Code) based on failure to
account for and pay withholding taxes. The defense was
inability to pay. The trial judge instructed the jury
that the term "wilful" in the misdemeanor counts meant,
among other things, "capriciously 6r with a careless disregard whether one has the right so to act," whereas the
same word in the felony counts meant 'with knowledge
of one's obligation to pay the taxes due and with intent
to defraud the Government of that tax by any affirmative conduct." 254 F. 2d, at 294. Relying on "Spies,
the Court of Appeals approved these instruictions and
concluded that
"the word 'wilful' as used in the misdemeanor
statute means something less when applied to a
failure to make a return than as applied to a felony
non-paymeAt of a tax. This being true, then the
words used in the instruction defining 'wilful' as
relates to . misdemeanor adequately and clearly
point up that difference." Ibid.

OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion "of the Court

412 U. S.

Because of an error' in the cross-examination of Abdul,
his conviction was reversed. On retrial, he wa again
convicted. He appealed, and the judgment was affirmed.
Abdut v. United States, 278 F. 2d 234 (CA9. 1960).
When Abdul sought certiorari, the Solicitor General conceded that the sentence under one of the counts could
hot stand and :undertook to say that the Government
would present to the District Court a motion for correction of the sentence. Certiorari, accordingly, was denied. Two Justices would have granted the writ to
review the, correctness of the charge "regarding the requirement of willfulness." 364 U. S. 832 (1960).
In the present case the Court of Appeals continued this
Abdul distinction between willfulness in tax misdemeanor
.charges and willfulness in tax felony charges. Section
7207, it was said, requires only a showing of "unreasonable, capricious, pr careless disregard for the truth or
falsity of income tax returns filed," whereas § 7206 (1)
"requires proof of an evil motive and bad faith,." 455
F. 2d, at 615. The level of willfulness, thus, would create
a disputed factual element that made appropriate a lesserincluded-offense instruction.
B. The decisions of this Court do not support the
holding in Abdul, and implicitly they reject the approach
taken by the Court of Appeals. In Spies, the Court
speculated, 317 U. S., at 495-498, that Congress could
have distinguished between the regulatory aspects of the
tax system, which call for compliance regardless of financial status, and the revenue-collecting aspects, which may
place demands on a taxpayer he cannot meet. Since the
antecedent of § 7203 (as does that section itself today)
punished both failure to file and failure to pay as misdemeanors, the Court concluded that Congress had not
drawn the line between felonies and misdemeanors on
the basis of distinctions between the system's regulatory
aspects and itsreveue-ecoIecting aspects. The reliance

UNITED STATES v. BISHOP

346

Opinion of the Court

in Abdul on that hypothetical statutory scheme, discussed by this Court in Spies but found not in line with
what Congress had actually done, was misplaced. Utilizing the unsupported Abdul distinction as a foundation,
the Court of Appeals constructed the further general distinction between tax felonies and tax inisdemean.ors, a
distinction also inconsistent with prior decisions of this
Court.
In Berra v. United States, 351 U. S. 131 (i956), a
defendant was convicted of violating the antecedent of
§ 7201, namely, §,145 (b) of the 1939 Code, a felony
statute identical, for present purposes, with the section
of the same number in the Revenue Act of 1936 at issue
in Spies. The defendant claimed that he was entitled
to a lesser-included-offense instruction based on § 3616
(a) of the 1939 Code, the antecedent of § 7207. The
Court rejected this contention, concluding that the two
sections of the 1939 Code then "covered precisely the
same ground." 351 U. S., at 134. Implicit in this was
the conclusion that the level of intent required for tax
misdemeanors was not automatically lower than the level
of intent required for tax felonies.
Although the misdemi"nor statute, § 3616 (a), prof-.
fered by thr, defendanit in Berradid not contain the word
"willfully," the Berra7lace

again in Sansone v. United States, 380 U. S. 343 (1965),

to evasion of the income tax." Achilli v. United States, 353 U. S.
373, 379 (1957). In Sansone, however, statutory revisions effected'
by the enactment of the 1954 'Code were held to make § 7207
applicable to income tax violations. Sansone v. United States, 380
U. S. 343, 347-349 (1965).

OCTOBER TERM, 1972,
Opinion of'the Court

412 U. S.

ment that a set of facts could exist that would satisfy
the willfulness element in the § 7207 misdemeahbr but
not in the' § 7201 felony:
"Given petitioner's material misstatement Which resulted in a tax deficiency, if, as the jury obviously
found, petitioner's act was willful in the sense that
he knew that he should have reported more income
than he did for the year 1957, he was guilty of
violating both §§ 7201 and 7207. If his action
was not willful, he was guilty of violating neither."
380 U. S., at 353.
The same dnalysis was applied, to the requested lesserincluded-offense instruction for § 7203. Id., at 352. The
clear implication of the decision in Sansone is that the
word "willfully" possesses the same meaning in §§ 7201,
7203, and 7207. Sansone thus foreclosed the argument
that the word "willfully" was to be given one meaning
in the tax felony statutes and another meaning in the
tax misdemeanor statutes.
The thesis relied upon by the Court of Appeals, therefore, was incorrect.
V
It would be possible, of course; that the word "Willfully" was intended by Congress to have a meaning in
§ 7206 (1) different from its meaning in § 7207, and we
turn now to that possibility.
We continue to recognize that context is important
in the quest for the word's meaning. See United States
v. Murdock, 290 U. S. 389, 394-395 (1933). Here, as in
Spies, the "legislative history of the section[s] contains
nothing helpful on the 'question here at issue, and we
must find the answer from the [sections themselves]
and i[their] context in the revenue laws."' 317 U. S.,
See H. R. Rep. No. 1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., A425 (1954); 8.
Rep. No. 1622, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., 602-603 (1954). The prede-

UNITED STATES v. BISHOP
346

Opinion'of the Court

at 495.. We consider first, then, the sections themselves-,
A. Respondent argues that both §§ 7206 (1) and 7207
apply to a fraudulent "return" and cover the same
ground if, the word "willfully" has the same meaning
in both sections. Since "it would be unusual and we
would not readily assume that Congress by the felony . . . meant no more than the same 'derelictions it
had just defined . . . as a misdemeanor," 317 U. S.,
at 497, respondent concludes that Congress must have
intended to require a more willful violation for the
felony than for the misdemeanor.
The critical difficulty for respondent is that the two
sections have substantially different express terms. The
most obvious difference is that § 7206 (1) applies only
if the document "contains -or is verified by a written
declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury." No equivalent requirement is present in § 7207.
Respondent recognizes this but then relies on the presence of perjury declarations on all federal income tax
returns, a fact that effectively equalizes the sections where
a federal tax'return is at issue. See 26 U. S. C.
§ 6065 (a).
This approach, however, is not persuasive for two
reasons. First, the Secretary or his delegate has the
power under § 6065 (a) to provide that no perjury declaration is required. If he does so provide, then § 7207
cessor to § 7206 (1)- was § 3809 (a) of the 1939 Code. The antecedent to § 7207 was, as we have noted above, § 3616 (a) of the
1939 Code. See Sansone, 380 U. S, at 347.
71, 6065. Verification of returns.
"(a) Penalties of pefjury.
"Except as otherwise provided by. the Secretary or his delegate,
any return, declaration, statement, or other document required to be
made under any provision of the internal revenue laws or regulations
shall contain or be verified by a written declaration that it is made
under the penalties of perjury." See also Treas. Reg. § 1.6065-1
(1972).

358

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

immediately becomes operative in the area theretofore
covered by § 7206 (1). Second, -the term "return" is
not necessarily limited to a federal income tax return.
A state or other nonfederal return could be intended and
might not contain a perjury warning. If this type of
return were submitted in support of a federal return,
or in the course of a tax audit, § 7207 could apply eyen
if § 7206 (1) could not.
There are other distinctions. The felony applies to a
document that a taxpayer "[w]illfully makes and subscribes . . . and which he does not believe to be true
and correct as to every material matter," whereas the
misdemeanor applies to a document that a taxpayer
"willfully delivers or discloses to the Secretary or his
delegate ... known by him ... to be false as to any
material xxatter." In the felony, then, the taxpayer must
verify the return or document in writing, and he is
liable if he -does' not affirmatively believe that the material statements are true. For the misdemeanor, however, a document prepared by another could give rise
to liability on the part of the taxpayer if he delivered
or disclosed it to the Service; additional protection is
given to the taxpayer in this situation because the document must be known by him to be fraudulent or to be
false.
These differences in the respective applications of
§§ 7206 (1) -and 7207 provide solid evidence that Con-gress distinguished the statutes in ways that do not
turn on the meaning of the word "willfully." Judge
Hastie, in analyzing this Court's holding in Spies, appropriately describbd this distinction as follows:
"However, this distinction is found in the additional misconduct which is essential to the violation
of the felony statute . . . and not in the quality

UNITED STATES v. BISHOP
346

Opinion of the Court

of willfulness which characterizes the .wrongdoing."
United States v. Vitiello, 363 F. 2d 240, 243 (CA3
1966).
Thus the word "willfully" may have a uniform meaning
in the" several statutes without rendering any one of
them surplusage. We next turn to context..
B. The hierarchy of tax offenses set forth in §§ 72017207, inclusive, utilizes the mental state rf the offender
as a guide in establishing the penalty. Section 7201, relating to attempts to evade or defeat tax, has been described and recognized by the Court as the "climax of
this variety of shnctions" and' as the "capstone of a
system of sanctions which singly or in combination were
calculated to induce prompt and forthright fulfillment
of every duty under the income tax law and to provide
a penalty suitable to every degree. of delinquency."
Spies, 317 U. S., at 497; Sansone, 380 U. S., at 350-351.
The actor's mental state is described both by the re,quirement that acts be done "willfully" and by the designation of certain express elements of the offenses. In
§ 7201, for example, the Court has held that, by requiring an attempt to evade, "Congress intended some willful commission in addition-to the willful omissions that
make up the list of misdemeanors." Spies, 317 U. S.,
at 499.' Similarly, in § 7207, the Government must show
that the document was known by the taxpayer to be
fraudulent or to be false as to a material matter.
All these offenses, except two subsections of § 7206,
viz., subsections o(3) and (4), require that actsbe done
"willfully." Although the described states of mind might
be included in the normal meaniig of the word" "willfully," thepresence of both an express designation and
the simyltaneous requirement that a violation be committed "willfully" is strong evidence that Congress used
-

OCTOBER TERM, 1972

.Opinion of the Court

412 3. S.

the word "willfully" to describe a constant rather than
a variable in the tax penalty formula.8
The Court, in fact,. has recognized that the word "willfully" in these statutes generally connotes a voluntary,
intentional violation of a known legal duty. It has
formulated the requirement of willfulness as "ba7d faith
or evil intent," Murdock; 290 U. S., at 398, or "evil motive
and. want of justification in view of all the financial circumstances of the taxpayer,"- Spies, 317 U. S., at 498,'
or knowledge that the taxpayer "should have reported

This longstanding interpretation of the purpose of
the recurring word "willfully" promotes coherence in the
group of tax crimes. In our complex tax system, uncertainty often arises even among taxpayers who earnestly wish to follow the law. The Court has said,
'Itis not the purpose of the law to penalize frank difference of opinion or innocent errors made despite the
5

Semantic confusion sometimes has been created when courts discuss the express requirement of an "attempt to evade" in § 7201
as if it were implicit in the word 'willfully" in that statute. This
type of analysis produces language. suggesting that "willfully" in
§ 7201 has a different meaning from the same term in § 7203. See
United States v. Ming, 466 F. 2d 1000, 1004 (CA7), cert. denied,
409 U. S.915 (1972) (§§ 7201 and 7203); United States v. Matosky,
421 F. 2d 410 (CA7), cert. denied, 398 U. S.904 (1970) (Q7203);
United States v. Haseltine, 419 F. 2d, at 581; Edwards v.
United States, 375 F. 2d, at 867; United States v. Schipani,
362 F. 2d 825, 831 (CA2), cert. denied, 385 U. S.934 (1966). This
Court may be somewhat responsible for this imprecision because h
similar analysis was employed in Spies v. United States, 317 U. S
492, 497-499 (1943). Greater clarity might well result from an
analysis that distinguishes the express elements, such as an "attempt,
to evade," prescribed by § 7201, from the uniform requirement of
willfulness.

Opinion of the Court

Spies, 317 U. S., at 496.
Degrees of negligence give rise in the tax system to
civil penalties. The requirement of an offense committed "willfully" is not met, therefore, if a taxpayer
has relied in good faith on a prior decision of this
Court. James v. United States,, 366 U. S., at 221-222.
Cf. Lambert v. California, 355. U. S. 225 (1957). The
Court's consistent interpretation of the.word "willfully"
to. require an element of mens tea implements the pervasive inmtent of Congress to construct penalties that
separate the purposeful tax violator from the wellmeaning, but easily confused, mass of taxpayers.
Until Congress speaks otherwise, we therefore shall
continue to require, in both tax felonies and tax misdemeanors that must be done "willfully," the bad purpose or evil motive described in Murdock, supra. We
hold, consequently, that the word "willfully" has the
same meaning in § 7207 that it has in § 7206 (1).' Since
the, only issue in-dispute in this case centered.on willfulness, it follows that a conviction of the misdemeanor
would clearly support a conviction for the felony." Under these circumstances a lesser-included-offense instruction was not required or proper, for in the federal system
it is not the function of the jury to set the penalty.
Berra v. United States, 351 U. S., at 134-135.
exercise of reasonable care."

The Goverijinent has argued that the misdemeanor of § 7207

could never be a lesser included offense in § 7206 (1) because the misdemeanor requires that the actor have knowledge of the falsity.
This is said to create an additional element in-the misdemeanor, not
present in, the felony, sio the misdemeanor is not "necessarily in-

ludd"'in the felony, within the meaning of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
31 (c). Our conclusion that the word "willfully" has the same
meaning in both statutes makes it unnecessary to reach this
contention.
