the Congress may impose, such as in the interest of navigation or pollution control, from asserting against the
State of Utah any claim of right, title, and interest:
(a) to the bed of the Great Salt Lake lying below the water's edge of Great Salt Lake on, June 15,
1967,* with the exception of any lands within the

of reliction applies and, if so, whether the doctrine of reliction vests in the United States, and thus divests the State
of Utah, of any right, title, or interest to any or all of the
exposed shorelands situated between the water's edge
on June 15, 1967, and the meander line of the Great
Salt Lake as duly surveyed prior to or in accordance with
ยง 1 of the Act of June 3, 1966, 80 Stat. 192. A Special
Master will be appointed by the Court to hold such
hearings, take such evidence, and conduct such proceedings as he deems appropriate and, in due course, to report his recommendations to the Court.
4. There also remains the question whether the lands
within the meander line of the Great Salt Lake (as duly
surveyed prior to or in accordance with ยง 1 of the Act of
June 3, 1966, 80 Stat. 192), and thus conveyed to the
State of Utah, included any federally owned uplands
above the bed of the Lake on the date of statehood
(January 4, 1896) which the United States still owned
prior to the conveyance to Utah. The Special Master
appointed by the Court as provided-in paragraph 3 above
will also be directed to hold such hearings, take such
evidence, and conduct such proceedings with respect to
this question as he deems appropriate in light of his
determinations with respect to the issues referred to him'
in paragraph 3 above and, in due course, to report his
recommendations to the Court.
5. The prayer of the United States of America in its
answer to the State of Utah's Complaint that this Court
"confirm, declare and establish that the United States is
the owner of all right, title and interest in all of the lands
described in Section 2 of the Act of June 3, 1966, 80 Stat.
192, as amended by the Act of August 23, 1966, 80 Stat.
349, and that the State of Utah is without any right, title

these lands conveyed to it by the United States, and to
pay for them, in accordance with the provisions of the
Act of June 3, 1966, as amended," is denied.
