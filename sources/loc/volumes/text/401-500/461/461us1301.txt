Decided April 21, 1983

An application for a stay of execution of applicant's death sentence, pending the disposition of his petition for certiorari to review the Alabama Supreme Court's denial of his motion requesting a new sentencing

hearing, is denied. Applicant's constitutional challenges to Alabama's
capital-sentencing procedures have been rejected by several state and
federal courts.

Justice.
This is an application for a stay of execution set for April
22, 1983, pending the disposition of a petition for certiorari to
the Alabama Supreme Court. The petition for certiorari
was filed on April 19, 1983. This application was fied later
the same day, following the Alabama Supreme Court's denial
of applicant's motion for a stay of execution. On April 20 the
State fied a response in opposition to the application for a
stay, and applicant filed a reply to the State's opposition.
Applicant was tried and convicted on April 26, 1977, in the
Mobile County, Ala., Circuit Court of first-degree murder
committed during the commission of a robbery. The trial
court sentenced him to death. Applicant's conviction and
sentence were affirmed by the Alabama Court of Criminal
Appeals, Evans v. State, 361 So. 2d 654 (1977), and the Alabama Supreme Court, 361 So. 2d 666 (per curiam), rehearing
denied, 361 So. 2d 672 (1978) (per curiam). This Court denied a petition for certiorari. 440 U. S. 930 (1979).
In April 1979 applicant fied a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Alabama, challenging the constitutionality of both

the conviction and the death sentence. The District Court
rejected all of his contentions and denied the petition.
Evans v. Britton, 472 F. Supp. 707 (1979). The Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding that applicant's conviction was invalid. Evans v. Britton, 628 F. 2d
400 (1980) (percuriam), modified on rehearing, 639 F. 2d 221
(1981) (percuriam). This Court granted the State's petition
for a writ of certiorari and, after briefing and argument,
reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Hopper v.
Evans, 456 U. S. 605 (1982).
This Court's judgment reinstated applicant's conviction,
but his challenges to Alabama's capital-sentencing procedures remained to be decided by the Court of Appeals on remand. In July 1982, however, applicant dismissed his attorneys and filed a motion with the Court of Appeals seeking to
dismiss his appeal. The court dismissed the appeal on October 19, 1982.
On October 22, 1982, the State of Alabama sought an order
from the Alabama Supreme Court setting an execution date.
Applicant then filed a motion requesting a new sentencing
hearing. On February 18, 1983, the Alabama Supreme
Court denied this motion, and on April 8, 1983, the court
ordered that applicant's execution be set for April 22, 1983.
Applicant's constitutional challenges to Alabama's capitalsentencing procedures have been reviewed exhaustively and
repetitively by several courts in both the state and federal
systems. I have reviewed the record and conclude that
there is not "a reasonable probability that four Members of
the Court would find that this case merits review." White v.
Florida,458 U. S. 1301, 1302 (1982) (POWELL, J., in chambers). All of the papers relevant to applicant's request for
a stay of execution also have been circulated to the entire
Court. With the concurrence of six other Members of the
Court, I deny the application for a stay.
