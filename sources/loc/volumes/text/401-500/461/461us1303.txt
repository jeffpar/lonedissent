VOLKSWAGENWERK A. G. v. FALZON ET AL., INDIVIDUALLY AND AS NEXT FRIENDS OF FALZON ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-875.

Decided April 29, 1983

Pursuant to this Court's Rule 44.4, under the "most extraordinary circumstances" of this case an application to stay the Michigan state trial court's
order in an action against applicant, a German corporation, directing the
taking of depositions of a number of applicant's employees who reside in
the Federal Republic of Germany, is granted pending the Michigan
Supreme Court's disposition of an application there to stay the taking of
the depositions.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, Circuit Justice.

Under Rule 44.4, the Justices of this Court will not entertain an application for a stay unless the applicant has first
sought relief from the appropriate lower court or courts, except "in the most extraordinary circumstances." I conclude
that this case presents most extraordinary circumstances and
will therefore entertain the application and grant a stay.
The applicant is a German corporation that is defending an
action in the Michigan state courts. The plaintiffs in that action seek to depose a number of employees of the applicant,
all of whom reside in the Federal Republic of Germany. Attempting to prevent the depositions in the trial court, the
applicant argued that the method the plaintiffs sought to
employ violated the Convention on the Taking of Evidence
Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters, [1972] 23 U. S. T.
2555, T. I. A. S. 7444, a treaty to which the United States
and the Federal Republic of Germany are parties. See Department of State, Treaties in Force 249 (1983). The trial
court denied the motion, and the Michigan Court of Appeals
denied leave to appeal. The applicant then sought review in
the Michigan Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the trial court ordered that the depositions take place on or before August 30,
1982, and the plaintiffs filed notice to take the depositions on

August 24, 1982. The applicant then applied to the Michigan
Supreme Court for an emergency stay of the order and for
immediate consideration of the order. When the State
Supreme Court did not act, the applicant sought a stay from
this Court, and on August 23, 1982, THE CHIEF JUSTICE
granted a stay pending final disposition of the appeals before
the Michigan Supreme Court. Volkswagenwerk A. G. v.
Falzon, A-191, 0. T. 1981. He later denied a motion to
vacate the stay. Volkswagenwerk A. G. v. Falzon, A-191,
0. T. 1981 (order of Sept. 2, 1982).
On February 22, 1983, the Michigan Supreme Court denied
the applicant's application for leave to appeal. At that point,
the stay entered by THE CHIEF JUSTICE expired by its own
terms. The plaintiffs then filed notice of taking depositions,
scheduling the depositions for May 2, 1983. On April 4,
1983, the applicant sought a stay of the depositions from the
Michigan Supreme Court, pending disposition of its appeal to
this Court of the earlier judgment of the Michigan Supreme
Court. The State Supreme Court has not acted, so the applicant now seeks a stay from this Court pending disposition
of the appeal here.
In granting the stay pending the disposition of the appeal
to the Michigan Supreme Court, THE CHIEF JUSTICE must
have concluded that there was a substantial chance that four
Justices would agree to consider the case on the merits, that
there was a significant chance that the applicant would prevail, and that the injury resulting from the denial of a stay
would be irreparable. See generally Graves v. Barnes, 405
U. S. 1201, 1203-1204 (1972) (POWELL, J., in chambers).
Since the question on the merits is unchanged, it is essentially the "law of the case" that a stay would be appropriate,
unless, of course, the response presents new information.
Cf. Schlesinger v. Holtzman, 414 U. S.1321, 1324-1325, and
nn. 3, 4 (1973) (Douglas, J., dissenting) (single Justice not
empowered to vacate stay granted by another Justice);

ed. 1978) (same). Consequently, the failure of the Michigan
Supreme Court to act promptly should not prevent a Member
of this Court from entertaining an application to stay the
order pending final disposition of the appeal in this Court.
Proper deference to the Michigan Supreme Court, however,
requires that that court have an opportunity to dispose of the
stay application before it. Accordingly, I grant the stay
pending disposition of the application for a stay in the Michigan Supreme Court.
