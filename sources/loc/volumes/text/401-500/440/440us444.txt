No. 77-6540. Argued February 22, 1979-Decided March 5, 1979
A writ of certiorari granted to decide a certain question as to the validity
of a guilty plea in a state prosecution is dismissed as having been improvidently granted, where after briefing and argument it is uncertain
that the question is actually presented.

PER CURIAM.

The petition for certiorari in this case stated the question
presented as follows:
"Whether a guilty plea is obtained in violation of due
process of law when it is induced by a judge's threat that,
should the defendant be convicted after trial, he will
receive a sentence almost four times greater than one
once seriously discussed, and more than twice as great as
the one then held out as part of a plea offer."
We granted certiorari to decide this question. 439 U. S. 892.
After briefing and oral argument, it has become evident that
on the record in this case it cannot be said with any degree of
certainty that this question is actually presented. The writ,
therefore, is dismissed as having been improvidently granted.
So ordered.
