Per Curiam

UNITED STATES v. HOLLYWOOD MOTOR CAR CO.,
INC., ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 81-1144.

Decided June 28, 1982

After respondents, originally indicted on two federal criminal counts in the
Eastern District of Kentucky, obtained a change of venue to the Central
District of California, the Government secured a superseding indictment
which added four new counts. The Government then obtained a voluntary dismissal of three of the counts (including one of the original
counts), and respondents moved to dismiss the remaining counts on the
ground that the superseding indictment manifested prosecutorial vindictiveness in retaliation for their exercising their right to a change of
venue, and thus ran afoul of the rule announced in Blackledge v. Perry,
417 U. S. 21. The District Court denied the motion but stayed the trial
to permit an appeal. The Court of Appeals held that the denial of
the motion to dismiss was immediately appealable as a "final decision"
under 28 U. S. C. § 1291, and that respondents had established a case
of prosecutorial vindictiveness requiring dismissal of the superseding
indictment.
Held: The Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1291 to review the District Court's interlocutory order refusing to dismiss the indictment. The policy embodied in § 1291 is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial court decisions that do not terminate the
litigation, and this policy is at its strongest in the field of criminal law.
Respondents' claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness does not fall within
the narrow group of claims coming within the "collateral order" exception to § 1291's rule of finality. Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S. 1; Abney v.
United States, 431 U. S. 651; and Helstoski v. Meanor, 442 U. S. 500,
distinguished. A claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness does not meet the
test under such exception of being "effectively unreviewable on appeal
from a final judgment." Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463,
468. Cf. United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850.
Certiorari granted; 646 F. 2d 384, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

Respondents, originally indicted in the Eastern District of
Kentucky on two counts for violations of 18 U. S. C. §§ 371

and 545, succeeded in obtaining a change of venue to the Central District of California. In the latter District, the Government secured a superseding indictment charging four new
substantive counts of making false statements to customs officers in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 542, in addition to the two
original counts. The Government then obtained a voluntary
dismissal of the original conspiracy count and two of the falsestatement counts. Respondents moved to dismiss the remaining counts on the ground that the superseding indictment manifested prosecutorial vindictiveness and therefore
ran afoul of the rule announced in Blackledge v. Perry, 417
U. S. 21 (1974). The District Court denied respondents' motion, but stayed the commencement of trial to permit an appeal. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held "that
the denial of a motion to dismiss based on the ground of vindictive prosecution is immediately appealable as a final decision under 28 U. S. C. § 1291." 646 F. 2d 384, 386 (1981).1
In reaching this holding the Court of Appeals relied on its
prior decisions in United States v. Burt, 619 F. 2d 831 (1980),
and United States v. Griffin, 617 F. 2d 1342, cert. denied, 449
U. S. 863 (1980). Reaching the merits, the court held that
respondents had established a case of prosecutorial vindictiveness requiring dismissal of the superseding indictment.
The United States then sought review in this Court.
We do not reach the question of prosecutorial vindictiveness, for we hold that the Court of Appeals was without
jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1291 to review the District Court's interlocutory order refusing to dismiss the indictment.
Congress has limited the jurisdiction of the
Courts of Appeals to "final decisions of the district courts."
'The rule in the Ninth Circuit directly conflicts with that adopted by the

Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia and Fifth Circuits. Those
courts have held that claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness may not be
aired in interlocutory appeals. United States v. Brizendine, 212 U. S.
App. D. C. 169, 659 F. 2d 215 (1981); United States v. Gregory, 656 F. 2d
1132 (CA5 1981).

28 U. S. C. § 1291. This Court has long held that the policy
of Congress embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal
appellate review of trial court decisions which do not terminate the litigation, and that this policy is at its strongest in
the field of criminal law:
"The general principle of federal appellate jurisdiction,
derived from the common law and enacted by the First
Congress, requires that review of nisi prius proceedings
await their termination by final judgment .... This in-

sistence on finality and prohibition of piecemeal review
discourage undue litigiousness and leaden-footed administration of justice, particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal cases. See Cobbledick v. United States,
309 U. S. 323, 324-326." DiBella v. United States, 369
U. S.121, 124 (1962).
This Court has interpreted the jurisdictional statute to permit departures from the rule of finality in only a limited category of cases falling within the "collateral order" exception
delineated in Cohen v. Beneficial IndustrialLoan Corp., 337
U. S. 541, 545-547 (1949). Such orders "must conclusively
determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue
completely separate from the merits of the action, and be
effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment."
Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978).
In criminal cases, we have adhered to the collateral order
exception to the rule of finality on three occasions: present
in each of these cases were factors noticeably lacking in the
instant appeal.
In Stack v. Boyle, 342 U. S.1 (1951), the Court held that
an order denying a motion to reduce bail could be reviewed
before trial. Writing separately, Justice Jackson (the author
of Cohen) recognized that "an order fixing bail can be reviewed without halting the main trial-its issues are entirely
independent of the issues to be tried-and unless it can be
reviewed before sentence, it never can be reviewed at all."

342 U. S., at 12. In Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651
(1977), we permitted interlocutory appeal of an order denying
a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy
grounds. Perhaps most important among the relevant factors, we recognized that "the rights conferred on a criminal accused by the Double Jeopardy Clause would be significantly undermined if appellate review of double jeopardy
claims were postponed until after conviction and sentence."
Id., at 660. One right guaranteed by the Double Jeopardy
Clause was the right not to be tried twice for the same
offense. "[I]f a criminal defendant is to avoid exposure to
double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of
the Clause, his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment
must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs."
Id., at 662 (emphasis in original). Finally, in Helstoski v.
Meanor, 442 U. S. 500 (1979), we held that a United States
Congressman could have taken an interlocutory appeal in
a criminal case to assert the immunity conferred upon him
by the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution. Crucial to the holding was our view that the Speech or Debate
Clause protected Congressmen "'not only from the consequences of litigation's results but also from the burden of defending themselves."' Id., at 508, quoting Dombrowski v.
Eastland, 387 U. S. 82, 85 (1967). The right protected by
the Clause would have been lost if the appeal had been
postponed.
Each of these cases, in addition to satisfying the other requirements of Cohen, involved "an asserted right the legal
and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not
vindicated before trial." United States v. MacDonald, 435
U. S. 850, 860 (1978). Our holding in United States v. MacDonald underscores the significance of this feature. The
issue in MacDonald was whether a defendant could appeal,
prior to trial, a District Court's order denying his motion to
dismiss the indictment because of an alleged violation of his

UNITED STATES v. HOLLYWOOD MOTOR CAR CO.

263

Per Curiam

Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. In concluding that
such an appeal was not authorized by 28 U. S. C. § 1291, we
noted:
"There perhaps is some superficial attraction in the argument that the right to a speedy trial.., must be vindicated before trial in order to insure that no nonspeedy
trial is ever held. Both doctrinally and pragmatically,
however, this argument fails. Unlike the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Speedy Trial
Clause does not, either on its face or according to the decisions of this Court, encompass a 'right not to be tried'
which must be upheld prior to trial if it is to be enjoyed
at all. It is the delay before trial, not the trial itself, that offends against the constitutional guarantee of
a speedy trial ....
Proceeding with the trial does not
cause or compound the deprivation already suffered."
Id., at 860-861.
Respondents assert that their claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness, based on the modification of the original indictment
in retaliation for their exercise of a right to move for change
of venue, is analogous to the three instances in which we have
allowed appeal in criminal cases under the collateral order
doctrine. But we think that their claim is more analogous to
the speedy trial claim which we held unreviewable under the
collateral order doctrine in United States v. MacDonald,
supra. We think that it particularly fails the third part of
the test for Cohen appeals articulated in Coopers & Lybrand,
supra, that the claim "be effectively unreviewable on appeal
from a final judgment."
Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21 (1974), on which respondents base the merits of their claim of vindictive prosecution, was an application of the principles announced in
North Carolinav. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), to conduct on
the part of a prosecutor. In Perry the defendant had been

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
Per Curiam

458 U. S.

convicted in a state court of limited jurisdiction, and had exercised his statutory right to a de novo appeal to the state
court of general jurisdiction. Prior to the commencement of
the latter trial, the prosecutor obtained an indictment charging the defendant with crimes more severe than those for
which he was initially convicted. Because the facts suggested "a realistic likelihood of 'vindictiveness,"' 417 U. S.,
at 27, we deemed it necessary to apply the "prophylactic rule
of Pearce,"id., at 26, in order to discourage retaliation by the
State for the defendant's exercise of his procedural right.
Although there is language in the Perry opinion suggesting
that the defendant possessed a "right not to be haled into
court at all" upon the more serious charge, id., at 30, it is
clear that the Court was not using this language to indicate
that he was entitled to be free of any retrial whatever. We
stated in Perry that "[w]hile the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment bars trial of Perry on the felony
assault charges in the Superior Court, North Carolina is
wholly free to conduct a trial de novo in the Superior Court
on the original misdemeanor assault charge." Id., at 31,
n. 8. The defendant in Perry was fully protected by postconviction relief, leading to a new trial free of the taint of
vindictiveness.
Obviously, it is wholly desirable to correct prior to trial any
substantive errors noticed at that time. It is equally evident
that when relief must await postconviction proceedings, the
defendant is subjected to the burden of defending himself at
trial, even though the presence of errors might require reversal of his conviction and possibly a second trial. Nevertheless, reversal of the conviction and, where the Double
Jeopardy Clause does not dictate otherwise, the provision of
a new trial free of prejudicial error normally are adequate
means of vindicating the constitutional rights of the accused. 2
2

Noting that "encouragement of delay is fatal to the vindication of the

criminal law," this Court has observed that "[b]earing the discomfiture and

UNITED STATES v. HOLLYWOOD MOTOR CAR CO.
263

269

Per Curiam

As we noted in United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S., at
860, n. 7:
"Admittedly, there is value-to all but the most unusual litigant-in triumphing before trial, rather than
after it, regardless of the substance of the winning claim.
But this truism is not to be confused with the quite distinct proposition that certain claims (because of the substance of the rights entailed, rather than the advantage
to a litigant in winning his claim sooner) should be resolved before trial."
Even when the vindication of the defendant's rights requires dismissal of charges altogether, the conditions justifying an interlocutory appeal are not necessarily satisfied. In
MacDonald, for example, we declined to permit a defendant
whose speedy trial motion had been denied before trial to obtain interlocutory appellate review, despite our recognition
that "an accused who does successfully establish a speedy
trial claim before trial will not be tried." Id., at 861, n. 8.
The nature of the speedy trial right was such that "[p]roceeding with the trial does not cause or compound the deprivation
already suffered." Id., at 861. This holding reflects the
crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right
whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges. See id., at
860, n. 7. The former necessarily falls into the category of
rights that can be enjoyed only if vindicated prior to trial.
The latter does not.
cost of a prosecution for crime even by an innocent person is one of the
painful obligations of citizenship." Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U. S.
323, 325 (1940). Thus, in the run of cases, "[t]he correctness of a trial
court's rejection even of a constitutional claim made by the accused in the
process of prosecution must await his conviction before its reconsideration
by an appellate tribunal." Id., at 325-326. This limitation imposed by
Congress must be observed even when the defendant's claim is considered
meritorious. See United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S.850, 857-858,
n. 6 (1978).

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
BLACKMUN,

J., dissenting

458 U. S.

The right asserted by respondents is simply not one that
must be upheld prior to trial if it is to be enjoyed at all.' As
noted in MacDonald, supra, there is a superficial plausibility
to the contention that any claim, particularly a constitutional
claim, that would be dispositive of the entire case if decided
favorably to a criminal defendant, should be decided as
quickly as possible in the course of the litigation. But if such
a principle were to be applied, questions as to the constitutionality of the statutes authorizing the prosecution and
doubtless numerous other questions would fall under such a
definition, and the policy against piecemeal appeals in criminal cases would be swallowed by ever-multiplying exceptions. It is only a narrow group of claims which meet the
test of being "effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final
judgment," and the claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness is,
we hold, not one of them.
The petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment of
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, with
instructions to that court to dismiss the appeal.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and
JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
Today, the Court carries its recent penchant for summary
decision to a new extreme. The substantial and controversial question raised here-whether an order denying a motion
'By holding that the right asserted by respondents is not one that "will
have been lost, probably irreparably," Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial

Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949), if appeal is postponed until the rendition of judgment, we imply no view on the merit of respondents' claim or
on the more general question whether the Due Process Clause is violated
by the addition of charges prior to trial. We merely hold that denial of a
motion to dismiss an indictment when the motion is premised on a claim of
prosecutorial vindictiveness is not a collateral order that can be appealed
prior to judgment under § 1291.

to dismiss based on prosecutorial vindictiveness is appealable
before trial--does not, in my view, lend itself to summary
treatment. Nevertheless, the Court has decided this important question of appellate jurisdiction without briefing or argument, even though it was not briefed or argued before the
District Court or the Court of Appeals and was not the subject of any lower court opinion. I dissent.
I
The Court, it seems to me, has shown a disturbing tendency of late to dispose of difficult cases by summary per
curiam reversals. I must assume that this tendency is
prompted, at least in part, by the growing pressures of the
Court's calendar and an ill-conceived conviction that we must
stay abreast of the increasing workload whatever the costs
may be. I regret this pattern, for I think it demeans the
Court and its work and surely tends to lessen the quality of
its legal product.
Summary action is particularly unfortunate in this case, for
the Court directs that respondents' appeal be dismissed on an
issue that was not raised by the Government until its petition
for rehearing in the Court of Appeals. Indeed, for more
than a year-until the Court of Appeals ruled on the merits in
favor of respondents-the Government affirmatively represented to that court that it "ha[d] jurisdiction to review prior
to trial a District Court's denial of a defendant's motion to
dismiss for vindictive prosecution." United States' Emergency Motion for Summary Affirmance of District Court, reprinted in App. to Brief in Opposition 5a. As a result, the
jurisdictional question was not briefed or argued before the
Court of Appeals or the District Court.
Respondents' opposition to the Government's petition for
certiorari understandably focuses on arguments for denying
certiorari-in particular, the Government's failure to raise
the jurisdictional issue in a more timely fashion. Coupled

OCTOBER TERM, 1981
BLACKMUN,

J., dissenting

458 U. S.

with the Government's litigation strategy, the Court's summary disposition therefore deprives respondents of their
"day in court" in a singularly inappropriate manner.
II
Additionally, I do not find today's ruling so clearly compelled as to warrant summary treatment, especially when the
Solicitor General, contrary to his frequent practice, has not
suggested summary reversal in his petition for certiorari.
In my view, the issue is important enough to be briefed and
argued fully in at least one court.
Certainly, the Court's disposition is not mandated by our
precedents. As the Court explains, Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), and Abney v.
United States, 431 U. S. 651 (1977), interpret 28 U. S. C.
§ 1291 as authorizing interlocutory appeals when a three-part
standard has been met. The Court fails, however, to mention the first two requirements, presumably because they are
satisfied here: that the denial of a defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment on vindictive prosecution grounds "constitute[s] a complete, formal, and, in the trial court, final
rejection of a criminal defendant's [vindictive prosecution]
claim," 431 U. S., at 659, and that it resolves an issue that
is "collateral to, and separable from, the principal issue at
the accused's impending criminal trial, i. e., whether or not
the accused is guilty of the offense charged," ibid. Unlike
the speedy trial claim before the Court in United States v.
MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850 (1978), which depended on an assessment of the extent to which delay had prejudiced the
defense-an assessment that could only be "speculative"
prior to trial, id., at 858-an allegation that the prosecutor
impermissibly increased the charges in response to the defendant's exercise of a legal right may be evaluated before trial,
for all the facts relevant to such a claim are fully available.
The Court properly suggests that the third requirement
set out in Cohen and Abney is the most difficult to apply in

UNITED STATES v. HOLLYWOOD MOTOR CAR CO.
263

BLACKMUN,

J., dissenting

this context. See ante, at 267. But, unlike the Court, I find
force in respondents' contention that the right they seek to
vindicate, in contrast to the right at issue in MacDonald, is
"a 'right not to be tried' which must be upheld prior to trial if
it is to be enjoyed at all." 435 U. S., at 861. In MacDonald, it was "the delay before trial, not the trial itself, that
offend[ed] against the constitutional guarantee of a speedy
trial." Ibid. When the defendant has been the victim of
vindictive prosecution, however, the Court has said that he
may "not to be haled into court at all upon the [increased]
charge." Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21, 30 (1974) (emphasis added). And we have analogized that right to the
right protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause, see id., at
31, which must, of course, be vindicated prior to trial if it is to
be protected at all.'
Moreover, postconviction review may not suffice to remedy the chilling effect the vindictive prosecution doctrine is
designed to prevent. The Court repeatedly has declined to
hold that the Due Process Clause forbids only prosecutorial
action taken with an actual retaliatory motive. Rather, it
has emphasized that "'since the fear of such vindictiveness
may unconstitutionally deter a defendant's exercise of [his]
right[s] ... , due process also requires that a defendant be
freed of apprehensionof such a retaliatory motivation .... P"
' See Abney v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 659 (1977) (noting that the
defendant in Blackledge v. Perry was "contesting the very authority of the
Government to hale him into court to face trial on the charge against him");
Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S., at 30-31 (observing that the defendant's
vindictive prosecution claim "went to the very power of the State to bring
the defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him"; that,
when the prosecutor acts vindictively in enhancing charges, the State is
"simply p:ecluded by the Due Process Clause from calling upon the respondent to answer to the more serious charge. . ."; that "[t]he very initiation of the proceedings against [a defendant subjected to vindictive
prosecution] operated to deny him due process of law"; and that "North
Carolina simply could not permissibly require Perry to answer to the fel-

ony charge").

458 U. S.

Id., at 28 (emphasis added), quoting North Carolina v.
Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 725 (1969); see also United States v.
Goodwin, 457 U. S. 368, 375-376 (1982). Even if a defendant is convinced that his vindictive prosecution claim ultimately will prevail on postconviction review, the increased
burdens attending a trial on enhanced charges may deter him
from exercising his legal rights. This may well not be a case,
then, where "reversal of the conviction and . . . a new trial
free of prejudicial error" are "adequate means of vindicating
the constitutional rights of the accused." Ante, at 268.
In addition to extending our precedents, the Court goes
well beyond the rulings of the two Courts of Appeals it characterizes as "directly conflict[ing]" with the decision below.
Ante, at 264, n. 1. In United States v. Brizendine, 212 U. S.
App. D. C. 169, 180, 659 F. 2d 215, 226 (1981), the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
refused to permit interlocutory appeals involving "claims of
due process violations arising from the plea bargaining process." That court, however, expressly refused to consider
the appealability of the denial of a motion to dismiss "in
the Blackledge situation . . . ," where the defendant's claim
"turned on a purely legal issue. . ." and challenged increased
charges filed in response to his exercise of a legal right. Id.,
at 175, 659 F. 2d, at 221. Similarly, in United States v.
Gregory, 656 F. 2d 1132, 1136 (1981), the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit did not foreclose the
possibility that some claims of prosecutorial vindictiveness
could be the subject of interlocutory appeal.2
2

Other Courts of Appeals have not restricted interlocutory appeals to

the three instances in which this Court has applied the collateral-order doctrine in criminal cases, see ante, at 265-266. See United States v. Venable, 585 F. 2d 71, 74-75 (CA3 1978) (denial of motion to bar retrial on collateral estoppel grounds is immediately appealable); United States v. Alessi,
536 F. 2d 978, 980-981 (CA2 1976) (denial of motion to dismiss indictment
that allegedly violated prior plea bargain may be the subject of an interlocutory appeal).
