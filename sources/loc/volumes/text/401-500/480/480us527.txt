TRUESDALE v. AIKEN, WARDEN, ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
No. 86-5530.
Certiorari granted.

Decided March 23, 1987

Reversed.

PER CURIAM.

The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed informa pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of South Carolina is reversed. Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978); Skipper v.
South Carolina, 476 U. S.1 (1986). See also United States
v. Johnson, 457 U. S.537, 549 (1982).
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE
JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting.

and

Today the Court grants certiorari and summarily reverses
a decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court that had refused to apply Skipper v. South Carolina,476 U. S.1 (1986),
retroactively to cases that were final at the time Skipper was
decided. I continue to believe that the appropriate test for
applying this Court's criminal law decisions retroactively to
federal habeas corpus petitions is the analysis set forth by
Justice Harlan in Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667,
681-695 (1971) (opinion concurring in judgment in Mackey
and dissenting from judgment in Williams v. United States,
401 U. S.646 (1971)). See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S.
314, 328-329 (1987) (POWELL, J., concurring). In Mackey,
Justice Harlan argued that "it is sounder, in adjudicating habeas petitions, generally to apply the law prevailing at the
time a conviction became final than it is to seek to dispose of

all these cases on the basis of intervening changes in constitutional interpretation." 401 U. S., at 689.'
Application of these principles to this case is not simple.
Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586 (1978), and Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982), were decided before petitioner's
conviction became final. Accordingly, under the retroactivity principles adopted in our recent decision in Griffith v.
Kentucky, supra, petitioner is entitled to the benefit of those
decisions. The Court appears to think that Skipper, supra,
merely applied the settled principles of Lockett and Eddings
to a new fact situation, and thus that petitioner also is entitled to the benefit of the Court's decision in Skipper.2
I do not agree that petitioner is entitled to the benefit of
our decision in Skipper. I continue to think that the result
in Skipper was "not required by our decisions in Lockett
and Eddings," Skipper, supra, at 9 (POWELL, J., concurring
in judgment) (citations omitted). In Lockett and Eddings,
the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits States
from excluding, at a capital-sentencing proceeding, relevant
evidence that tends to lessen the defendant's culpability.
Lockett v. Ohio, supra, at 604; Eddings v. Oklahoma, supra,
at 114. In Skipper, this rule was extended to require admission of evidence that was unrelated to culpability. Rather,
the State was required to admit evidence relevant to the de'Justice Harlan identified two exceptions to this rule: cases that "place
certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power
of the criminal law-making authority," 401 U. S., at 692, and where there
are "claims of nonobservance of those procedures that . . . are 'implicit in
the concept of ordered liberty,"' id., at 693 (quoting Palko v. Connecticut,
302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937)). Neither of these exceptions is applicable to this
case.
'The Court supports this conclusion by reference to the statement in
United States v. Johnson, 457 U. S. 537 (1982), that "when a decision of
this Court merely has applied settled precedents to new and different factual situations, no real question has arisen as to whether the later decision
should apply retrospectively, . . . because the later decision has not in fact
altered that rule in any material way." Id., at 549.

fendant's probable future conduct as a prisoner.' Neither
the author of the plurality opinion in Lockett nor the author
of the Court's opinion in Eddings agreed with the Court's decision in Skipper. Although I am of course bound by the
Court's decision on the merits in Skipper, this is not incompatible with my view that Skipper broke new ground.
Therefore, I do not believe this petitioner's conviction was
incorrect under the law existing when the conviction became
final. The South Carolina court decided this case in accord
with the precedents existing at the time of petitioner's
conviction.
I acknowledge that we cannot determine with certainty
how the Court would have decided this case at the time petitioner was convicted. Because of the inherent subjectivity
of this determination, I do not find summary disposition of
this case appropriate. Moreover, there are several questions related to this case that have not been decided by this
Court's decisions. At least in the context of habeas petitions, we have not addressed the standards by which a court
should determine the retroactive effect of cases like Skipper
that arguably follow from pre-existing precedents. Nor has
the Court decided whether the same retroactivity rules
should apply to state postconviction proceedings that apply to
3

The Court in Skipper explained: "Consideration of a defendant's past
conduct as indicative of his probable future behavior is an inevitable and
not undesirable element of criminal sentencing: 'any sentencing authority
must predict a convicted person's probable future conduct when it engages
in the process of determining what punishment to impose."' Skipper v.
South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1, 5 (1986) (quoting Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S.
262, 275 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.)).
The "past conduct" to which the Skipper Court referred was Skipper's
good behavior after his conviction and death sentence.
II am not the first to note the difficulty of making these determinations.
See Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 263-269 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting); Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 695 (1971) (opinion of
Harlan, J., concurring in judgment in Mackey and dissenting from judgment in Williams v. United States, 401 U. S. 646 (1971)).

federal habeas proceedings. A substantial argument could
be made that this is a question of state procedural law and
that-whatever the federal rule eventually may becomestate courts considering such petitions need not consider
developments in constitutional law that occur after the conviction became final. Of course, we should not resolve these
questions without full briefing and consideration.
If these questions were properly presented, I would vote
to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari. As the more
important questions are not directly raised, my vote is to
deny the petition. It seems to me that summary reversal is
wholly inappropriate, and accordingly I dissent.
