OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS

CALIFORNIA v. HAMILTON
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-805.

Decided May 6, 1986

California's application to stay enforcement of the California Supreme
Court's judgment invalidating respondent's death sentence is granted.
The State Supreme Court's judgment was based on its holdings that the
failure to properly instruct the jury at respondent's murder trial on the
issue of intent to kill violated his right to due process under Sandstrom
v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510, and that such error was not harmless. The
State seeks the stay so that it can petition for certiorari to raise the question of the proper constitutional standard for determining prejudice with
regard to Sandstrom errors. Since the outcome here may well be affected by the decision in another, pending case, it is likely that a majority of this Court would not want to dispose of the petition for certiorari in
this case before a decision is rendered in such other case.

Circuit Justice.
Applicant, the State of California, asks that I stay pending
disposition of its petition for certiorari the enforcement of the
judgment of the California Supreme Court, which invalidated
the death sentence imposed on respondent Hamilton for the
1979 murder of a woman near San Diego. 41 Cal. 3d 408, 710
P. 2d 981 (1985). The jury was not instructed that it was required, as a matter of state law under Carlos v. Superior
Court, 35 Cal. 3d 131, 672 P. 2d 862 (1983), to find that Hamilton intended to kill his victim before it could impose the
death penalty. The California Supreme Court held that this
failure to properly instruct the jury on the issue of intent violated Hamilton's right to due process under this Court's decision in Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979). 41 Cal.
3d, at 431, 710 P. 2d, at 995. The court also held that such

Sandstrom error was not harmless under the four-part test
for harmlessness set forth in People v. Garcia,36 Cal. 3d 539,
554-557, 684 P. 2d 826, 835-837 (1984), cert. denied, 469
U. S. 1229 (1985). In particular, the court concluded that
the fourth part of the Garcia test, under which a Sandstrom
error may be found harmless if "the record not only establishes the necessary intent as a matter of law but shows the
contrary evidence not worthy of consideration," Garcia,
supra, at 556, 684 P. 2d, at 835, did not apply to the instant
case. 41 Cal. 3d, at 432, 710 P. 2d, at 995-996.
The State requests a stay so that it can petition for certiorari, raising the following question: "What is the proper
standard of prejudice under the United States Constitution
for errors in jury instructions regarding intent to kill in capital cases?" The State argues that the California Supreme
Court misconstrued this Court's decision in Connecticut v.
Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983), when it set up in Garcia its
four-part harmlessness test for Sandstrom errors, and that
under a proper test the Sandstrom error in the instant case
would be found harmless. The State also points out that,
under California law, it will be forced to begin a new trial on
the issue of Hamilton's sentence by May 12, 1986, or be forever barred from seeking the death penalty. See Cal. Penal
Code Ann. ยง 1382(2) (West 1982). On the other hand, since
the California Supreme Court affirmed Hamilton's murder
conviction, he will remain confined whether or not a stay is
granted.
This Court currently has before it the case of Rose v.
Clark, No. 84-1974, which involves the question whether a
Sandstrom error may ever be found harmless and, if so,
under what circumstances. Our decision in Rose v. Clark
may well affect the outcome of the instant case. For this
reason, I believe that a majority of this Court would not want
to dispose of the petition for certiorari in this case before a
decision is rendered in Rose v. Clark. I therefore stay the

enforcement of the judgment of the California Supreme
Court pending further action by me or by the Court.
