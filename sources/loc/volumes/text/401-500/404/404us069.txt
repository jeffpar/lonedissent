COURT OF ARKANSAS

No.

Decided November 16, 1971

Certiorari granted; 249 Ark. 1075, 467 S. W. 2d 707, reversed and
remanded.
PER CURIAM.

The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. Petitioner's alleged procedural default does not bar consideration of his constitutional* claim in the circumstances of
this case. See Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U. S. 443, 447449 (1965). The judgment of the Supreme Court of
Arkansas is reversed. Griffin v. California,380 U. S. 609
(1965). The case is remanded for further proceedings
not inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
