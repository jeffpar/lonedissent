dissenting.
These are applications for bail in cases from the Court
of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Catena pending certiorari to this Court and in Annaloro pending appeal to
the Court of Appeals. Each applicant was convicted by
a state court for refusing to testify before a grand jury.
Each sought habeas corpus in the federal court; and in the
Catecna case, 449 F. 2d 40, the Court of Appeals held
that the applicant was unconstitutionally detained.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
DoUGLAs, J., dissenting

404 U. S.

Concededly, the Annaloro case is on all fours with Catena,
although the Court of Appeals has not yet heard the
merits.
The underlying question in these cases is whether the
immunity to which a witness is entitled who refuses to
testify because of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the
Fifth Amendment is "transactional" immunity, or "use"
immunity.' The question is one that was stirred last
Term in Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U. S.548. As MR.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and I concluded in that case, the constitutional requirement calls
for "transactional" immunity. Id., at 550-551,562, et seq.
That plainly is the law as it now stands, ibid.; and the
Court of Appeals so held. Since applicants were granted
only "use" immunity and refused to testify on that
ground, they have wrongfully been imprisoned. They
are therefore being held unconstitutionally and should
be discharged pending review of the cases.
. We have noted jurisdiction in No. 69-4, Zicarelli v.
New Jersey State Commission of Investigation,401 U. S.
933, which raises the same question. But since Malloy
v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Self-Incrimination Clause to the
States as fully as to the Federal Government, it will
require a reversal in direction by this Court and a dilution of Malloy to say that these applicants are lawfully
detained.
I would follow settled law until it is changed and
meanwhile discharge these prisoners on suitable bail.*
*"A justice or judge of the United States before whom a habeas
.corpus proceeding is pending, may, before final judgment or after
final judgment of discharge, or pending appeal, stay any proceeding
against the person detained in any State court or by or under the
authority of any State for any matter involved in the habeas corpus
proceeding." 28 U. S. C. § 2251.

ITY V. ROCKEFELLER, GOVERNOR OF

NEW

YORK, ET AL.

C. A. 2d Cir. Application for temporary restraining
order or injunction presented to MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL,
and by him referred to the Court, denied.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.

Applicants, state prisoners currently incarcerated at
Attica State Prison,1 brought a class action in the District Court, under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 and 28 U. S. C.
§ 1343 (3), alleging systematic violations of their constitutional rights by prison officials and state authorities in

the aftermath of the Attica uprising of September 9-13,
1971. They requested, inter alia, that state officials be
enjoined from questioning any prisoners concerning the
uprising unless Miranda warnings 2 were given and counsel present. The District Court denied this request, while
reserving rulings on other requested relief arising from
Subsequent to the retaking 'of the prison on September 13, all in-

mates who had not been freed from their cells were transferred to
other institutions. The current prison population at Attica consists
only of prisoners who had previously been assigned to Cell Block D,
which was the block involved in the uprising.
2 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, held that the subject of custodial interrogation must be clearly advised that he has a right to
remain silent, and that anything he says may be used against him in
court. He must be clearly informed that he has a right to consult
with an attorney, to have an attorney present during interrogation,
and, if he is indigent, to have an attorney appointed to represent
him. Statements elicited without these warnings having beei. given
are inadmissible against the subject at trial.

charges of beatings, threats, interference with access to
counsel, and destruction of legal materials. 3 The question, however, was certified for appeal to the Court of
Appeals, and is at present awaiting a decision there.
This is a case in which the public interest runs high
and which raises grave questions concerning procedures
for law enforcement that comport with the Constitution.
The need for an immediate, authoritative determination
of the prisoners' claims is paramount. It would serve
no interest of the public,' or of judicial order, for that
determination to await the exhaustion of remedies in the
lower courts.
Miranda is part of a prisoner's bill of rights. In a
recent case Miranda was applied where a federal agent
questioned a prisoner who was at the time serving a state
sentence on a different crime. The Solicitor General
argued that Mirandawas not applicable to that situation.
We disagreed and, speaking through Mr. Justice Black,
said:
"The Government also seeks to narrow the scope
of the Mirandaholding by making it applicable only
to questioning one who is 'in custody' in connection
with the very case under investigation. There is no
substance to such a distinction, and in effect it goes
against the whole 'purpose of the Miranda decision
which was designed to give meaningful protection
to Fifth Amendment rights. We find nothing in
the Miranda opinion which calls for a curtailment
of the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the -reason why the
3The District Court, on October 6, 1971, dismissed the remainder
of the prisoners' claims. " Were an appeal of these claims presently
docketed in the Court of Appeals, I would consolidate them so that
the entire case could be disposed of at ofie time.,

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.

Petitioner Lee infringed respondent's copyright and a
verdict was rendered against her. Petitioner argued that
because the congressional power over copyrights and
patent3 stemmed from the same constitutional provision,
they both should be governed by the same standard.
Thus, petitioner contended that the copyright was invalid
because the book in question lacked "novelty," but the
Court of Appeals rejected this argument saying that the
appropriate standard for a copyright was "originality"
and that the respondent's book met this criterion. 1 The
standard of copyrightability presents an important question concerning the scope of Congress' enumerated
powers. It has not heretofore been decided by this
Court 2 and, arguably, it was wrongly decided by the
courts below.
1Runge v. Lee, 441 F 2d 579, 581 (CA9 1971):
"The standard of 'novelty' urged by appellants is applicable to
patents, but not copyrights. The copyright standard is one of
'originality':
"'The requirements for the "originality" necessary to support a copyright are modest. The author must have created the work by his
own skill, labor and judgment, contributing something "recognizably
his own" to prior treatments of the same subject. However, neither
great novelty nor superior artistic quality is required.'" Quoting
Doran v. Sunset House Dist. Corp., 197 F. Supp. 940, 944 (SD Cal'.
1961), aff'd, 304 F. 2d 251 (CA9 1962).
2 Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, dealt only with the statutory
standards for copyrightability because the constitutional questions
were not raised until oral argument. Respondent's reliance upon
Mazsr as an expression of the constitutional standards for copyrights is therefore misplaced. Those cases in which we have considered the constitutional ramifications of the copyright power
have not dealt with the standard of copyrightability. E. g.,
Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U. S. 239; BurrowGiles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U. S. 53. See also Note, 68
Harv. L. Rev. 517 (1955).

In 1961, respondent published and copyrighted a book
entitled Face Lifting by Exercise. This book explained
how isometric facial exercises could be used to preserve
the appearance of youth. It was based on respondent's
study of anatomy, physical therapy, and magazine and
newspaper articles, but there is nothing in the record to
indicate that the ideas it contained constituted anything
more than "selecting the last piece to put into the last
opening in a jig-saw puzzle." Sinclair & Carroll Co. v.
Interchemical Corp., 325 U. S. 327, 335. It was merely
a repetition of the existing state of the art. During
1962, petitioner was employed in respondent's beauty
salon and we may assume that it was during this time
that petitioner first read respondent's book and learned
of respondent's facial exercises. In 1965, petitioner published The Joyce Lee Method of Scientific Facial Exercises. It contained a system of facial exercises strikingly
similar to respondent's and, even though it was unquestionably expressed in petitioner's own language, we may
safely conclude that it was based on respondent's book.
An action for copyright infringement was made out,
therefore, if the respondent's copyright was valid and if
it embraced the ideas in her book.
The constitutional power over copyrights is found in the
same clause that governs the issuance of patents: "The
Congress shall have Power . . . To promote the Progress
of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times
to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
respective Writings and Discoveries." Art. I, § 8, cl. 8.
Many of the same interests underlie both grants of
power. The Federalist No. 43. While this Court has
not had many occasions to consider the constitutional
parameters of copyright power, we have indicated that
the introductory clause, "To promote the Progress of
Science and useful Arts," acts as a limit on Congress'

ORDERS
887

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

power to grant monopolies through patents. In Graham
v. John Deere Co., 383 U. S. 1, 5-6, we said:
"The clause is both a grant of power and a limitation. This qualified authority, unlike the power
often exercised in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries by the English Crown, is limited to the
promotion of advances in the 'useful arts.' It was
written against the backdrop of the practices-eventually curtailed by the Statute of Monopolies-of the
Crown in granting monopolies to court favorites in
goods or businesses which had long before been
enjoyed by the public. The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the
restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. Nor may it enlarge the patent monopoly
without regard to the innovation, advancement or
social benefit gained, thereby. Moreover, Congress
may not authorize the issuance of patents whose
effects are to remove existent knowledge from the
public domain, br to restrict free access to materials
already available. Innovation, advancement, and
things which add to the sum of the useful knowledge
are inherent requisites in a patent system which by
constitutional command must 'promote the Progress
of ... useful Arts.' This is the standard expressed
in the Constitution and it may not be ignored.
And it is in this light that patent validity 'requires reference to a standard written into the Constitution.' " (Citations omitted.)
In Mazer v. Stein, 347 U. S. 201, 219, we indicated
that the copyright power is also governed by this same
introductory phrase: "The economic philosophy behind
the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and
copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and

inventors in 'Science and useful Arts.' " See also Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U. S. 239, 249.
In other contexts, we have also shown that patents and
copyrights stand on the same footing. E. g., United
States v. ParamountPictures, 334 U. S. 131, 158; Sheldon
v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 309 U. S. 390, 401.
No reason can be offered why we should depart from the
plain import of this grant of congressional power and
apply more lenient constitutional standards to copyrights
than to patents.' Indeed, for reasons which will later
be considered, a copyright may have to meet greater
constitutional standards for validity than a patent. The
limitations set forth in Graham v. John Deere Co., therefore, apply with at least equal force to copyrights. Cf.
Burrow-Giles LithographicCo. v. Sarony, 111 U. S. 53, 59.
An author's "Writing" or an inventor's "Discovery"
can, in the constitutional sense, only extend to that
which is his own. It may not be broadened to include
matters within the public domain. The congressional
power to grant monopolies for "Writings and Discoveries"
is likewise limited to that which accomplishes the stated
purpose of promoting "the Progress of Science and useful
Arts." No distinction is made in the constitutional language between copyrights and patents and I would not
create one by judicial gloss. Where, as here, a writer
has published a book which compiles and applies infor5Statutory support for the distinction made by the courts below
is, at best, flimsy. It is true that the standards of "novelty,"
35 U. S. C. § 102, and "non-obviousness," 35 U. S. C. § 103, are
embodied in the patent statutes. "Originality," however, is not set
forth in the copyright laws as a sufficient measure of copyrightability
and it owes its development solely to the courts. E. g., Du Puy v.
Post Telegram Co., 210 F. 883 (CA3 1914); Edward Thompson Co.
v. American Law Book Co., 122 F. 922 (CA2 1903). A longstanding, but erroneous, pattern of statutory interpretation may not be
spared from the force of a constitutional mandate by reason of its
longevity. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64.

mation available to all men, should that writer have a
monopoly on the ideas in that book through a copyright

issued merely because the words used were the author's
own?
Patents which did not serve the broad goals of furthering scientific advancement and bettering the lot of
mankind (Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U. S. 147, 154-155 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring)) have been held invalid because they
lacked utility, did no more than combine existing inventions, were obvious to someone schooled in the art, or
sought to monopolize ideas within the public domain.
Graham v. John Deere Co., supra, Great Atlantic &
Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., supra;
Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248. It is not obvious
that respondent's system of facial exercises was patentable
under these standards. It arguably amounted to nothing more than an application of existing knowledge
based upon sources available to all men. We have
repeatedly held that patents so devoid of novelty were
invalid. To create a monopoly under the copyright
power which would not be available under the patent
power would be to betray the common birthright of all
men at the altar of hollow formalisms.
The application of the constitutional standard of
"novelty" will not "invalidate the copyright in a substantial portion of all literary works, where novelty as
distinguished from originality is a very rare commodity,"
as one commentator has suggested.4

be extended to all. "[A] copyright gives no exclusive
right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to
the expression of the idea-not the idea itself." Mazer
v. Stein, supra, at 217. The manner in which the words
or musical notes are combined to recount the Faustian
legend could well satisfy the constitutional requirement
of novelty even though the broad ideas they describe
may be part of the public domain. This question is not
before us in the present case, however, because the
manner of expression used by petitioner was unquestionably her own and it was only the ideas of respondent
that were used.'
Serious First Amendment questions would be raised if
Congress' power over copyrights were construed to include the power to grant monopolies over certain ideas.
See Nimmer, Does Copyright Abridge the First Amendment Guarantees of Free Speech and Press?, 17 U. C.
L. A. L. Rev. 1180 (1970). The framers of the Bill of
Rights added the guarantees of freedom of speech and
of the press because they did not feel them to be sufficiently protected by the original Constitution. This
liberty is necessary if we are to have free, open, and
lively debate of political and social ideas. The "public

court to conclude that photographs of the assassination
were not entitled to the full range of copyright protection. Time, Inc. v. Bernard Geis Associates, 293 F. Supp.
130, 146 (SDNY 1968). The arena of public debate
would be quiet, indeed, if a politician could copyright his
speeches or a philosopher his treatises and thus obtain
a monopoly on the ideas they contained. We should not
construe the copyright laws to conflict so patently with
the values that the First Amendment was designed to
protect.
Application of the novelty standard does not require
that a person whose literary work is used by another be
left without a remedy. We deal here only with the
extent of Congress' enumerated constitutional powers.
Quite different questions would be raised by actions for
unfair competition or conversion of a common-law property interest. International News Service v. Associated
Press, 248 U. S. 215. Similarly, different questions
would be involved had Congress acted pursuant to other
enumerated powers. Cf. Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S.
416. The respondent's rights are limited to that which
is necessary to "promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts." This requires a level of "novelty" which
respondent arguably has not satisfied.
I would grant certiorari and set the case for argument.

On the morning of September 22, 1968, the petitioner
and a companion, both Americans, were walking westward along Highway 94 near Tecate, California, and were
three-fourths of a mile from the Mexican border. Two
federal customs agents stopped them, learned their iden-

tities, directed the pair to walk in roadside dust, and
concluded that their shoeprints were similar to those
the officers had seen only hours earlier in sand "traps"
some 50 yards south of the highway.' Suspecting the
two of smuggling contraband, the agents detained them
while reinforcements arrived and backtracked in search
of contraband which officers believed might have been
hidden along the pair's path. During the probe two
knapsacks containing marihuana were found at a spot
100 yards east of the point where the two had been
stopped and near the trail which officers believed had
been left by the petitioner and his companion. The
officers then formally arrested them and afterwards traced
what they suspected to be the pair's footprints to a
railroad tunnel nearer the border leading into Mexico.
The two were convicted of smuggling marihuana, in a
trial before a jury. The Government was unable to produce direct evidence that the defendants had actually
crossed the border via the railroad tunnel. In fact, all
the agents could claim was that they had traced what
they believed to be the defendants' footprints into the
mouth of the tunnel. Furthermore, no direct evidence
was adduced to show, assuming the pair had crossed the
border, that they had crossed with marihuana. Given
the lack of direct evidence on any of these matters, however, the Government understandably desired to be more
persuasive.
To shore up its case the Government introduced, over
objection, testimony of an agent that the locality of
these events had been "possibly the hottest spot on the
Mexican border for smuggling." He was permitted to
tell of his participation in six prior, unrelated investigaIA "trap" is a sandy area brushed smooth at regular intervals

tions of other peisons' smuggling activities. On four
of these occasions, said the officer, arrestees had been
tracked by their footprints and had been found possessing
marihuana. On two other occasions, aliens had been
caught unlawfully entering the United States. Apparently, the point the prosecution wished to convey was
that using the tunnel was a favorite modus operandi
for sneaking aliens and hemp into the United States.
The Government now attempts to justify this testimony
on the theory that it tended to rebut the possibility that
the pair had merely been hitchhiking. As a second justification, the Government contends the remarks helped
establish the "signcutting" credentials of the agent by
showing that his tracking skills had proved successful
2
on prior occasions.
I would reverse the case and order a new trial.
The witness' view on the criminal tendencies of persons found near the border was not relevant to any fact at
issue in the trial. It was merely an attempt to construct
a supposed class of suspect persons to which it appeared
the petitioner belonged. Courts have been hesitant to
admit statistical evidence of this nature because of the
ease with which it can be abused.3 Only after many

"Signcutting" is the art of tracking the path of persons traveling

3 Judicial history is replete with examples of misapplied statistics
in criminal cases. One prominent example was the conviction of
Captain Alfred Dreyfus in France in 1899. He was accused of
writing state secrets and conveying his inscriptions to German
spies. The prosecution attempted to show that Dreyfus had penned
the letter, by introducing lexicographical experts' opinions. The
prosecutor was successful in persuading the jury that there had been
an "amazing" frequency of graphical similarities between the letters
and others known to have been written by Dreyfus. But, as a
panel of experts later pointed out, there was nothing statistically
remarkable about the existence of the similarities. For the view

years of improvements were evidences of fingerprints,
firearms ballistics, and radar data admitted in prosecutions. And, evidence of blood tests for identification
purposes or polygraph readings still face an uncertain
future in our courts. 4 We have here an attempt by the
Government to impute to a class of persons criminal
tendencies simply on the, strength of one custom agent's
anecdotal experiences in four prior investigations. The
attempt was not relevant since a rational juror could
not have sensibly used the information.
The jury might have suspected the two simply as
marihuana users who had been hitchhiking along the
highway and who had hidden the contraband upon seeing
to comprehend any of the witness' mathematical speculation, see
A. Charpentier, The Dreyfus Case 52-53 (J. May transl. 1935).
A more recent American case is that of People v. Collins, 68
Cal. 2d 319, 438 P. 2d 33 (1968), in which the prosecutor at trial
said he showed that only one in 12 million people could, as the
defendant did, match the description of the perpetrator of a robbery.
The California Supreme Court ultimately pointed out, among other
criticisms of the mathematical demonstration, that in a population
of 24 million the prosecutor's assumption would lead to the conclusion
that there were two persons matching the description, which alone
should have established reasonable doubt. These cases and others
misapplying statistics are discussed in Tribe, Trial By Mathematics:

the customs agents'. automobile. Under these circumstances it would have been understandable for the Government to desire to show that a high proportion of
persons found with hemp near the Mexican border in
fact had recently brought their supply personally from
Mexico. It may well be that such is the case. But that
proposition does not follow from the four instances
recalled by the customs agent. In Leary v. United
States, 395 U. S. 6, 30 (1969), we noted the increasing
harvests of domestic crops of marihuana. And, of course,
it would not follow that all possessors even of foreign
grown cannabis personally import their supply. In
short, the Government offered an unbalanced and incomplete picture of the ways in which persons under circumstances such as these had obtained their marihuana.
It is no answer that the defendant was free to challenge the Government's general view of statistical probabilities by presenting other explanations of the circumstances or by impeaching the Government's expert
witness. We should not impose upon an accused the
burden of independently generating probabilistic evidence and employing experts to study the criminal tendencies of a subgroup of the population. The Government should live up to higher standards and not be
allowed to convict people of crimes on suspicion alone.

TRUSTEE, ET AL.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.

The petitioner, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., publishes credit
reports available by private subscription. Because Altoona Clay Products, Inc., was a sizable concern it became a subject of analysis by the petitioner. From time
to time the petitioner issued confidential financial
studies of Altoona which were requested by the subject's
creditors and suppliers.
In early January 1963, one of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc.'s,
employees discovered in the judgment index of Blair
County, Pennsylvania, an unsatisfied entry of $60,000
against Altoona Clay Products Company, a predecessor
and defunct enterprise which had been operated by those
controlling the subject. On January 3, 1963, the petitioner issued an inalysis concerning Altoona, noting this
find, but failing to state ..hat the unpaid judgment was
against an entirely different firm, at least technically, so
that its creditors and suppliers were led to believe that
the outstanding liability was owed by Altoona. The
error was retracted by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., in April
1963, but respondent Grove, a trustee in bankruptcy presiding over Altoona's estate, claims that the financial
demise of his ward was worked during the interim misunderstanding.
After protracted litigation initiated in the District
Court on diversity jurisdiction, involving a prior appeal
and remand, a jury, applying Pennsylvania libel law,
awarded $110,000 in "general damages" to the trustee in
bankruptcy. No special damages were found. The District Court, however, entered a judgment n. o. v. in
favor of Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., on the ground that New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), pro-

scribed libel judgments under such circumstances of
innocent error.
The respondent appealed this order to the Third Circuit, which reversed, reinstating the verdict and holding
that "the doctrine of New York Times v. Sullivan does
not extend to private credit reports, and that any allegations of defamation concerning such reports are properly
subject to the libel laws of the several states." 438 F. 2d
433, 438. The opinion issued by the Third Circuit distinguished New York Times on three grounds: (a) unlike
Sullivan, the subject of these private reports, Altoona, had
no access to the same medium to correct the error; (b) unlike the civil rights struggle, the confidential nature of
these nonpublic reports fell outside the realm of public
debate; and (c) unlike New York Times, the dispute
here was factual in nature, not a difference of opinion.
I would grant certiorari and hear argument on the
question whether we should reverse the Third Circuit's
holding, not because it misreads the New York Times
case, but because libel and slander awards are no longer
constitutionally permissible elements of American law.
It is clear that the First Amendment would proscribe
any attempt to enact a federal libel law, notwithstanding
the Alien and Sedition Act (1 Stat. 596) to the contrary.'
I do not suppose that anyone considered at the'time of
its adoption whether the Fourteenth Amendment meant
that state courts could no longer participate in libel and
slander awards. But I have expressed the idea before
that "constitutional law is not frozen as of a particular

by the same prohibition that had forbidden federal libel
laws.
Accordingly, it is difficult to see how it is within our
province to hold that both intentional and reckless falsehoods are outside constitutionally protected discussion.
That question has been decided to the contrary by constitutional draftsmen believing that even false statements perform an important function. Whether intentional, whether false, all opinions and allegations in
this forensic community are cq.talytic elements which
tend to cause us to react, to rethink, and to reply. And
even if deliberate untruths were unworthy of protection,
it would be counterproductive, as Madison warned,
enunciating his views on the Sedition Act, to attempt to
adjudicate which were true and which were not:
"Among those principles deemed sacred in America,
among those sacred rights considered as forming the
bulwark of their liberty, which the Government contemplates with awful reverence and would approach
only with the most cautious circumspection, there is
no one of which the importance is more deeply impressed on the public mind than the liberty of the
press. That this liberty is often carried to excess;
that it has sometimes degenerated into licentiousness,
is seen and lamented, but the remedy has not yet
been discovered. Perhaps it is an evil inseparable
from the good with which it is allied; perhaps it is
a shoot which cannot be stripped from the stalk
without wounding vitally the plant from which it is
torn. However desirable those measures might be
which might correct without enslaving the press,

(Hunt ed. 1906).
Thus under our system the libeled may rebut their accusers and presumably those who care about the debate
will listen; but repair to the courts for damages no longer
is constitutionally permissible.
The wisdom of an absolute prohibition against libel
recoveries has been demonstrated by the subsequent
experience with the rule announced in New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan, supra. Although the common law of
libel had fallen into relative disuse, it was revived by
the Civil Rights Movement of the last decade which
generated heated accusations and, in turn, resort by the
defamed to sympathetic state courts to penalize with
spectacular awards "outside agitators" who had published criticisms. In the New York Times case, the plaintiff obtained a half-million-dollar judgment from an Alabama jury against the New York Times which had
published an advertisement in support of civil rights
workers in Alabama, which seemed to be critical of Sullivan. Thus for the first time after it had become clear
that First Amendment freedoms were incorporated into
the Fourteenth,' this Court considered the extent to which
awarding libel damages had to yield to the protection of
2
a free press.
Mr. Justice Black, in my view, correctly stated that
"the minimum guarantee of the First Amendment" is
that the press has an "unconditional right to say what
[it] pleases about public affairs." Id., at 297 (emphasis
added). The majority, however, felt it necessary to
"balance" the state interests underlying libel awards
2

The issue presented in New York Times had also been considered

by the Court in Schenectady Union Publishing Co. v. Sweeney, 316
U. S. 642 (1942) (equally divided vote).

against the countervailing constitutional values of free
expression, producing an actual-malice test to be applied
where public officials were criticized. Id., at 283. I
have continually reiterated my agreement with Mr. Justice Black, but, even if a balancing approach were appropriate, I also believe that the seven years since New York
Times demonstrate that an improper balance was struck.
There is a strong argument that the reasons which led
the New York Times majority to reject broader liability
of publishers a fortiori should also have compelled absolute immunity for defamatory comment. If the common-law tests had been too elusive to protect First
Amendment interests then the actual-malice test has
proved neither to be more precise nor to be a better
guardian. Proof of knowledge that a statement is
false requires slippery proof of a mental state, as does a
showing of reckless disregard. Seldom is evidence clear
on these issues and a local jury asked to "weigh all
the circumstances" can continue under this evanescent
test to penalize unpopular speech. The formula is not
made stronger by placing the burden of proof on the
plaintiff or by requiring "convincing clarity" in the degree
of proof. These haunting defects have been implicitly
recognized on at least ten recent occasions, including the
New York Times case, wherein majorities declined to remand for further jury proceedings but instead in each
case examined the record, weighed the evidence, found it
insufficient, and absolved the publisher.3

Moreover, the rationale for permitting even limited
liability seems dubious. The actual-malice standard, it
is said, permits liability because "calculated falsehoods" are not constitutionally protected. Garrison v.
Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 75 (1964). But, as mentioned
earlier, even untrue remarks may have positive effects
upon the quality of our re-examination process. Moreover, if the rough-and-tumble of debate
is the best
vehicle for producing approximations of factual truth or
preferred opinion, then courts have no business making
prematurb and interim evaluations of contested statements' merits.
Finally, a factor which the New York Times majority
failed to gauge properly was the interest of judicial administration in avoiding continuing readjustment of constitutional doctrine. On 16 occasions since and including that case this Court has attempted to clarify
the appropriate balance from circumstance to circumstance." The narrow focus on "public officials" I was
broadened to include "public figures" 6 and most recently
has been expanded to statements of "general or public in(1964), which relied on New York Times to invalidate a criminal
libel statute, thereby precluding a jury retrial. That the actualmalice test provides inadequate protection against whimsical juries
has been pointed out by four Justices. See Linn v. Plant Guard
Workers, 383 U. S. 53, 70-71 (1966) (Fortas, J., dissenting); New
York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra, at 293 (Black, J., concurring),

terest." '

The latter, more blurred focus, as Justices
Harlan, MARSHALL, and STEWART recently observed, will
further require this Court to poll itself with increasing
regularity to determine what events are of sufficient
general or public interest to deserve protection. Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U. S.29, 62, 81 (1971).
Thus in Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U. S. 374 (1967), an
obscure family's captivity by escaped convicts propelled
them into the "public spotlight," and, similarly, in
Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., supra, a majority felt
that an arrest of a magazine salesman was sufficiently
"public" to endow a radio station with greater protection for an erroneous newscast that his arrest had
been for selling obscene material. It is evident that
this ad hoc approach has backed the Court into the
same subjective quagmire which has trapped the judiciary in the obscenity cases.
Decisions subsequent to New York Times I have both
tightened the actual-malice test and expanded its displacement of the common law. The logical extension of
these decisions should in time eliminate entirely libel and
slander recoveries from American jurisprudence.
I am unpersuaded by the notion that because the
petitioner's publications were commercial in nature they
deserved less or no First Amendment protection. It is
Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., 403 U. S., at 43.
8 It is evident that the transition from "public official" to "public
figure" to "events of public or general interest" has substantially
broadened the instances in which the actual-malice test is applicable.
At the same time the actual-malice test has been tightened by
virtually eliminating reckless disregard as a component. The Couirt
in Beckley Newspapers Corp. v. Hanks, 389 U. S., at 83, 94,
defined "reckless disregard" to mean a "'high degree of awareness of . . .probable falsity.'"

But even though the Court in the

abstract has gone far toward eliminating libel, in practice, juries
remain able to justify libel penalties under the nebulous "actual
malice" test.

true that Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52 (1942),
held that business advertisements and commercial matters fell outside sanctioned expression, but as I suggested
in Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 513-515
(1959) (concurring opinion), that holding was ill-conceived and has not weathered subsequent scrutiny.
Only two years after Valentine we held that a municipality could not apply its flat license tax to an evangelist
who earned his livelihood by selling religious tracts door
to door. Similarly, Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 343
U. S. 495, 499 (1952), disposed of the view that because
cinemas were profit enterprises their films were somehow
deprived of full First Amendment status. And, in the
field of libel we were unanimous in the New York Times
case in rejecting the argument that because defamatory
comment had been printed as an advertisement for profit
it was less deserving of protection. New York Times
Co. v. Sullivan, supra,at 265-266. Surely we have eroded
Valentine to the extent that it held a commercial form
of publication negated the applicability of the First
Amendment. Nor, in my view, should commercial content be controlling. The language of the First Amendment does not except speech directed at private economic
decisionmaking. Certainly such speech could not be regarded as less important than political expression. When
immersed in a free flow of commercial information, private sector decisionmaking is at least as effective an
institution as are our various governments in furthering the social interest in obtaining the best general allocation of resources.9 W. Baumol, Economic Theory and
Presumably the credit reports published by the petitioner facilitate through the price system the improvement of human welfare

The financial data circulated by Dun & Bradstreet,
Inc., are part of the fabric of national commercial communication. There is no doubt that an adverse credit
rating can injure a subject. But one injured can inform
his suppliers and creditors that a report is misleading.
Indeed, in this case, Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., was willing
to print a retraction. It is difficult to credit the claim
that the "general damages" suffered by the respondent
resulted from the short-term confusion between the mispublication and the retraction. In any event, in my
view, it has been predetermined that such speculative
costs of unfettered communication are preferable to the
chill upon free expression that libel laws impose.
I would grant certiorari and set the case for oral

I would grant the injunction so that the case can be

is whether the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) has
satisfied the mandate of the National Environmental

Opinion of

DOUGLAS, J.

404 U. S.

Policy Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 852, 42 U. S. C. § 4321 et seq.
By § 102 (2)(C) of that Act,' 42 U. S. C. § 4332 (2)(C),
Congress directed each agency of the Federal Government to "include in every recommendation or report
on proposals for legislation and other major Federal
actions significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on"(i) the environmental impact of the proposed
action,
"(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,
"(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,
"(iv) the relationship between local short-term
uses of man's environment and the maintenance and
enhancement of long-term productivity, and
"(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the
proposed action should it be implemented."
I agree with the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit in Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Committee, Inc. v. Atomic Energy Commission, 146 U. S.
App. D. C. 33, 39, 449 F. 2d 1109, 1115, that "if
the decision [under NEPA] was reached [by AEC] procedurally without individualized consideration and balancing of environmental factors-conducted fully and in
good faith-it is the responsibility of the courts to
reverse."
That opinion, rendered on July 23, 1971, by a panel
consisting of Judges Wright, Tamm, and Robinson,
found that AEC's procedures in this nuclear area did
not comply with the Act and that its entire approach

to the environmental problems in the nuclear field violated the Act.
Another panel of the same Court of Appeals, composed
of Judges Bazelon, Leventhal, and Robinson, said in the
instant case, after examining in camera the relevant
environmental documents,
"We are left with difficult questions about the validity of the AEC's environmental statement.2 But
a hurried review of several hundred pages of technical documents cannot provide a satisfactory basis
U. S. App. D. C.
for resolving this litigation." -, , 463 F. 2d 796, 798.
In that opinion the Court of Appeals did not approve the findings of the District Court that the order
complies with the Act, saying, "In our view the case does
present a substantial question as to the legality of the
proposed test."
I have added in an appendix some apparently obvious
defects in AEC's Impact Statement (hereafter sometimes I. S.).
As the Court of Appeals held in an earlier opinion in this case,
463 F. 2d 783, 786, Congress did not
-,
U. S. App. D. C.-,
intend, by approving funds for the Cannikin detonation, to repeal
the NEPA as it applied to the test.
"On the contrary, there is an affirmative indication that at least
some of the Congressmen voting for the authorization and appropriations measures specifically contemplated that the claim of illegality remained for resolution by the courts."
See Remarks of Rep. Price, 117 Cong. Rec. H6785, July 15, 1971:
"This matter is before the court. I submit that if there has been
any violation of the law, the court will supply the appropriate
remedy."
Other federal courts have similarly concluded that congressional
appropriations for a project subject to NEPA are not to be taken
as expressing any view with respect to compliance with NEPA.

We plainly do. not have time to resolve this question
between now and the scheduled detonation. Accordingly, I would grant the injunction so that a full Court
can consider the case on the merits.
APPENDIX TO OPINION OF DOUGLAS, J.
In the Calvert Cliffs case the Court of Appeals held
that the procedural rules adopted by AEC for the preparation of Environmental Impact Statements did not
meet statutory requirements. And in the October 5,
197!, opinion by the Court of Appeals in the instant case
it is held that "responsible opposing views" on environmental damage "need be included" in the Impact Statement in the form of "a meaningful reference that identifies the problem at hand for the responsible official."
U. S. App. D. C. -, -,
463 F. 2d 783, 787.
The Act requires that reports from federal agencies
required by the Act and the guidelines of the Council on
Environmental Quality (CEQ) to be consulted with respect to the preparation of an Impact Statement, which
are adverse to the project with respect to which their
views are sought, must be released as part of the Impact
Statement prepared by the agency responsible for the
project.
Here, several such reports were not disclosed. The
existence of these reports became known through newspaper stories and debates on the floor of Congress.
These reports were the subject of the discovery proceedings which caused such a long delay in this litigation.
The reports in question included those of:
(a) Russell Train, Chairman of CEQ;
(b) Edward E. David, Jr., Director of Office of Science and Technology (OST);
(c) William D. Ruckelshaus, Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and
(d) Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the AEC.

ORDERS
917

Appendix to opinion of DouGLs, J.

The CEQ guidelines specifically state that the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act, 5 V. S. C.
§ 552, are not applicable to agency comments made in
the course of consultations with reference to the preparation of an Impact Statement. The Act and § 7 of the
guidelines direct that an agency charged with the preparation of an Impact Statement "consult with, and obtain
the comment on the environmental impact of the action
of, Federal agencies with jurisdiction by law or special
expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved." 36 Fed. Reg. 7725. The EPA is specifically
designated to be one of the agencies within the contemplation of § 7, ibid. And under § 10 (f) of the regulations, the AEC would be the agency "responsible for
making the statement and the comments received available to the public pursuant to the provisions of the
Freedom of Information Act." Id., at 7726. Besides
the express designation of the EPA, the argument is
compelling that the other agencies in question have
"special expertise" and, in the case of the AEC, "jurisdiction by law" concerning the various environmental
effects to be expected from an underground nuclear
explosion.
Once noncompliance with the NEPA is shown, the
federal courts have uniformly held that injunctive relief
is appropriate.
Disclosure of these statements to the public by any
federal agency which has "special expertise with respect
to any environmental impact involved" is indeed required by § 102 (2) (C) of the Act. And the courts have
consistently held that a defect in the Impact Statement
presents a justiciable question and is the basis for equitable relief. West Virginia Highlands Conservancy v.
Island Creek Coal Co., 441 F. 2d 232; Environmental
Defense Fund v. Corps of Engineers, 325 F. Supp. 749,

OCTOBER TERM, 1971

Appendix to opinion of

DOUGLAS,

404 U. S.

Seismic Dangers:
According to the Impact Statement, "No significant
environmental impact can be expected from the seismic
activity caused by the CANNIKIN test." I. S. 3.
Two sorts of seismic effects are at issue. First, there is
the possibility that the explosion might trigger a natural
earthquake of greater force than the bomb itself. The
Impact Statement asserts that:
"The possibility of the CANNIKIN test 'triggering'
an earthquake with seismic energy comparable to or
greater than that produced by the explosion itself is
very unlikely. Since the understanding of earthquake mechanisms is still developing and is not yet
sufficient for exact calculations, the possibility of
such an occurrence cannot be ruled out. However,
foremost seismologists have asserted that an explosion
at Amchitka will not trigger a large earthquake ...
unless the occurrence of such an event is imminent,
very near to the test site." Ibid.
This conclusion is based on nothing more than an assertion to this effect by "[a] panel of eminent scientists
and engineers . . . acting as consultants to the AEC,"
id., at 54, which was presumably based, in turn, on
"the size and location of the CANNIKIN explosion, considered along with the size and frequency of
naturally occurring earthquakes and the experience
gained by observation of past nuclear detonations
and aftershocks." Id., at 3.
That more should be required is clear from the heretofore secret memorandum written by Russell Train of the
CEQ (hereafter Train memo), the agency charged with
the broadest statutory authority in establishing national
environmental policy.

ORDERS

917

Appendix to opinion of

DouGLAs, J.

According to Mr. Train,
"All the earthquakes triggered by underground explosions in the various Nevada tests released substantially less energy than the explosion itself. If
one could establish that this is a necessary condition
then there would be no apprehension with regard
to the CANNIKIN event. Unfortunately, this is
not the case. The magnitude of the triggered earthquakes will depend on the state of strain in the crust
in the general region at which the underground explosion is set off. Extrapolation from the Nevada
experience is uncertain because of the fundamentally
different geologic setting between Nevada and the
Aleutians. Further, experience with MILROW [a
one-megaton underground detonation set off on
Amchitka in 1969] does not provide a sure basis
for extrapolation. In the highly nonlinear phenomena involved in earthquake generation, there may be
a threshold value of the strain that must be exceeded prior to initiation of a large earthquake."
Train memo 4.
Mr. Train goes on to explain that "great earthquakes"
(those with a force of 8.0 or more on the Richter scale)
are now considered to result from the cumuis ive effects
of a series of smaller shocks. (CANNIKIN is expected
to register about 7.0 on the Richter scale.) Referring
specifically to great earthquakes occurring within the
past few years in Chile and Alaska, he notes that the
theoretical explanation for these events justifies a concern that the force of CANNIKIN, which would be the
largest underground device exploded by man, might surpass the "threshold" required to trigger a great quake.
"The suggested explanation of the Chilean and Alaskan earthquakes in terms of a succession of smaller
earthquakes would support this interpretation. In

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
Appendix to opinion of DOUGLAS, J.

404 U. S.

this model a number of lock points stabilize a fault.
Once one lock point is broken, sufficient energy may
be released to break other lock points. If the stored
strain energy is large, then the triggered earthquake
could be of much greater magnitude than the triggering event. The underground explosion could serve
as the first domino of the row of dominoes leading
to a major earthquake. The major fault in the
general region of Amchitka is thought to be some
40 km. beneath the test shot. The strain field will
certainly .be altered at this depth by the underground explosion. Observations on the BENHAM
event [a one-megaton detonation at the Nevada test
sites] showed strains exceeding tidal strains at 29
km." Ibid.
The CANNIKIN yield may be as high as five times that
of the BENHAM and MILROW devices.
The "lock-point" theory is also explained in a statement by J. W. Hadley (hereafter Hadley memo), which
had also been suppressed until this week. The theory
is nowhere discussed, nor even "alluded to," in the
Impact Statement.
A further misleading conclusion in the Impact Statement is that CANNIKIN could not trigger a natural
quake unless that quake "is imminent, very near to the
test site." The documents revealed this week indicate
there is a possibility that earthquakes may be triggered
by a rise in underground fluid levels, or by artificial
loading of the earth's crust. Presumably, the fluid
lubricates the rock along a fault line, thus enhancing
the potential for slippage. A series of earthquakes along
a dormant fault near Denver has been definitely attributed to the pumping of waste water deep into the earth
by the Rowky Mountain Arsenal. Train memo 2-3.
"A second example is found in the case of earthquakes associated with large lakes or reservoirs. As

ORDERS
917

Appendix to opinion of DOUGLAS, J.

a result of loading of the earth's crust by these large
bodies of water or by the modification of the groundwater flow or for some other reason not yet understood, substantial earthquakes have been associated
with construction of large artificial lakes. A recent
earthquake near Koyna Dam in India located in an
area that is not normally seismic killed about 200
people. Similarly, many small earthquakes occurred
when Lake Mead was filled." Id., at 3.
Increased subsurface fluid pressure will be one result
of CANNIKIN.
"[T]he explosion will alter the pressure regime in
the groundwater. The water pressure in the rocks
interstices will increase due to the compaction of the
ground around the cavity. . . . This increase in
the fluid pressure will reduce the friction between
fracture separated blocks. The effect would be
greatest on faults oriented parallel to the residual
compressive stresses resulting from the test explosion. Thus, it is possible that the mechanism involved in the Denver earthquake would raise the
probability of triggering a large earthquake." Ibid.
Thus, it would appear that "imminence" may not be
necessary for .CANNIKIN to trigger a large earthquake. This possibility is not mentioned in the Impact Statement.
The Impact Statement also fails to consider the longterm effects of the CANNIKIN device on the geology.
"The creation of a large cavity together with a later
collapse of the chimney produces permanent changes
in the strain field. . . . However, the strain field resulting from an underground explosion cannot be calculated
with any precision because of the dependence of the
field on the detailed geology which is largely unknown at
any given location." Ibid.

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
Appendix to opinion of

DOUGLAS,

J.

404 U. S.

Not only does the Impact Statement fail to assess
the possible effects of permanent changes in the strain
field, but it represents that the geologic conditions at
Amchitka have been fully explored. I. S. 19.
Perhaps the most striking deception of the Impact
Statement, in light of the Train memo, is its attempt
to represent that professional opinion is unanimous that
there is no real danger that CANNIKIN will trigger a
large earthquake. According to Mr. Hadley, however,
"Qualified scientific opinion is in good agreement
that the possibility of triggering a large earthquake
by CANNIKIN is remote, but real. . . . Variation
of technical opinion from this position is minor."
Hadley memo 6.
The second seismic effect which might result from
CANNIKIN is a tsunami, or tidal wave. According to
the Impact Statement, "the possibility of the CANNIKIN explosion, or an earthquake causing a damaging
tsunami (seismic sea wave) is even more unlikely [than
the triggering of a great earthquake]." I. S. 3. The
Train memo itself points out, "Large earthquakes in
the near vicinity of Amchitka have not caused destructive tsunamis in the past." Train memo 4. Train
goes on, however: "[A]s in the case of earthquakes it is
not possible at this time to assess quantitatively the
probability of a tsunami following the explosion." Id.,
at 4-5. Another heretofore suppressed statement, that
of Dr. W. G. Van Dorn, entitled Probability of Tsunami
Generation and Connection with CANNIKIN, indicates the author to be as deeply concerned about the
danger from the explosion as the "well-qualified geophysicists" who believe that the risks are great, and
whose views are contained in an attachment to the
Train memo. Those views remain suppressed. Considering the awesome destructive capabilities of even a

ORDERS
917

Appendix to opinion of DOUGLAS, J.

"small" tsunami, and its ability to retain its destructive
force thousands of miles from its source, it would seem
incumbent upon the drafters of the Impact Statement
to explore in greater detail the sources of such responsible concern.
Venting:
The second category of environmental hazards from
the CANNIKIN event are those relating to the danger
that radioactive material from the explosion might escape
to the surface. The most serious problem is the effect
on groundwater movement, for the water table on Amchitka extends almost to the surface.
According to the analysis of the Impact Statement,
the most probable mode of groundwater circulation by
which radionuclides might escape into the sea would
take "a thousand years or more." I. S. 24. The least
likely
"involves the very unlikely assumption that the
water within the cavity-chimney system becomes
completely mixed [with radionuclides, predominately
tritium], coupled with a second unlikely assumption
that the flow through the rock occurs only through
a system of interconnecting fractures. Estimates
using these assumptions indicate contaminated
water would reach the sea in . . . some three years
after the explosion. This would introduce tritiated
[radioactive] water into the ocean with an initial
concentration about 1,200 times that of the RCG
[recommended concentration guideline] for water."
Ibid.
Indeed, the Impact Statement thinks it far more probable that only "some small fraction of the tritiated
water" will "move upward in the chimney rubble." And
only relatively near the surface will increased perme-

Appendix to opinion of DOUOLAS, J.

404 U.S.

ability provide a path to the sea. The Impact Statement estimates that no tritium would be released into
the water for over a hundred years through this mechanism. Ibid.
The Train memo, however, relying on calculations
from the United States Geological Survey, comes to a
different conclusion.
"Water in the chimney would move to the sea at
a rate dependent on the hydraulic head, the permeability of existing aquifers and permeability of any
new fractures opened up by the explosion. USGS
calculations indicate a time for such movement
might be as short as one to two years. These are
short times and are inconsistent with estimates made
by AEC that tritium will be discharged into the
ocean only 145 years after the explosion. . .. If
the shorter times (5 to 10 years) postulated above
.are correct then the level of radioactivity in the
groundwater entering the ocean would be in excess
of ten thousand to one hundred thousand maximum permissible concentration for water." Train
memo 5.
Thus, the judgment of the Chairman of the Council on
Environmental Quality is that it is likely, if not probable,
that within 10 years of CANNIKIN, radioactive water
of concentrations perhaps 100,000 times permitted maxi-.
mums will reach the sea near Amchitka. Inasmuch as
this estimate is 100 times greater than their own, I
should think it would require consideration by the
drafters of the Impact Statement.
Another document shown to the applicants herein for
the first time this week supports the Train analysis:
"[I]t must also be admitted, and this is the basis for
the Council on Environmental Quality's [Train's]

ORDERS
917

Appendix to opinion of DouGcs, J.

comments on CANNIKIN, that the rubble chimney
constitutes a highly permeable vertical short circuit
of the groundwater system, and that the hydrological measurements indicate zones of fairly permeable rock higher in the section." M. Merritt, The
Ground Water Problem at Amchitka 1-2.
The USGS recognized that its water migration time
scale was highly inconsistent with that of the AEC; in
so doing, it reaffirmed its original position:
"It should be emphasized that the foregoing analysis
is heavily weighed in favor of the worst case. However, it is difficult to conceive of conditions which
might improve the outlook significantly." USGS,
Effects Evaluation Report-Cannikin Event.
The AEC was aware of the USGS position with respect to groundwater migration. It simply ignored it.
More disturbing than the failure of the Impact Statement to meet the arguments advanced by its critics, perhaps, is a deliberate distortion, in certain instances, of
those opposing views. Thus, the statement argues that
even were the "extreme case" to occur, and radioactive
water migrate to the sea within a few years,
"dilution of that water by the sea water would take
place rapidly. With the seeping water being swept
up by the passing ocean current and mixed through
tidal action and wave action, oceanographers have
estimated that there would be an effective dilution
factor of about 100,000 within a few hours. In this
manner, the sea water tritium would quickly dilute
to levels comparable to those freshwater levels acceptable for lifetime use by humans." I. S. 25.
Compare this use of the dilution figure with that of Train:
"Even if the dilution is as great as a hundred thousand, there is the possibility of concentration of tri-

tium well above background levels in various steps

would grant a temporary restraining order pending applicants' filing of a petition for certiorari and action by the
Court on the petition. The question to be presented is
whether the detonation of CANNIKIN would be illegal
if the Atomic Energy Commission did not comply with
the mandate of § 102 (2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Court of Appeals did
not accept the holding of the District Court that the
Commission had complied with § 102 (2) (C), stating,
"In our view the case does present a substantial question
as to the legality of the proposed test." The oral argument confirmed this view. In that circumstance, to
avoid mootness, the Commission must be enjoined from
proceeding with CANNIKIN until the Court decides
whether to review the question of its legality.
No. A-465.

The Court today denies certiorari to a black man who
stands convicted by an all-white jury which had been
selected through a process which petitioner alleges methodically excluded members of minority racial groups.
The most pernicious of the practices used to exclude
black and Chicano jurors was what purported to be an
intelligence test which, because of its cultural bias and
its blatant unreliability, excluded nearly 50% of the
otherwise qualified prospective jurors from minority
groups. We would all agree that the brand of justice
received in our courts should not depend upon the color
of one's skin and that the selection of jury panels should
not be tainted by the exclusion of racial groups. With
all respect, I fear precisely that result has obtained in
the case.Petitioner was convicted of the unlawful possession of
marihuana. The State's evidence consisted of the testimoay of two white police officers that they observed and
smelled petitioner smoking a marihuana cigarette and
that he dropped the cigarette on the ground before he was
arrested. Petitioner steadfastly denied his guilt. He
offered witnesses who "testified that, because of an obstruction, it was not possible to see" the area where

petitioner was allegedly smoking marihuana, who sup-,
ported his story "that no one was smoking marihuana,"
and who gave credence to the apparent theory of the
defense that a black man was being framed by white
police officers. People v. Donaldson, Crim. No. 17615
(Ct. App. Cal., Dec. 21, 1970, unpublished opinion).
The issue for the jury was the relative credibility of
two white police officers and the four black defense
witnesses. Cf. Note, 79 Yale L. J. 531 (1970). That
this question was close is indicated by the fact that after
some 51/4 hours of deliberation the jury reported itself
deadlocked eight-to-four and an Allen charge was then
given. See Allen v. United States, 164 U. S. 492 (1896).
It took an additional hour of deliberation before the jury
resolved the credibility issue against petitioner and returned a verdict of guilty.
On appeal, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the
conviction, holding that petitioner, as a black, had no
standing to challenge the exclusion of Chicanos from the
jury panel,1 that the exclusion of racial minorities was
unintentional and that, in any event, it did not deny
equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court of
California denied a petition for a hearing and petitioner
now seeks a writ of certiorari.
The culturally biased intelligence test used in this
case excludes almost half of the otherwise qualified prospective jurors from minority groups. It is also argued
that members of racial minority groups are effectively
barred from jury service by (1) the selection of prospecSuch reasoning is contrary to BaUard v. United States, 329 U. S.
187, 195 (1946), where we said, "[R]eversible error does not depend
on a showing of prejudice in an individual case. The evil lies in
the admitted exclusion of an eligible class or group in the community in disregard of the prescribed standards of jury selection. ...
The injury is not limited to the defendant-there is injury to the
jury system, to the law as an institution, to the community at large,
and to the democratic ideal reflected in the processes of our courts."

tive jurors solely from voter registration lists despite the
significantly lower incidence of registration by blacks and
Chicanos, (2) the absence of any follow-up procedures
to correct for the high frequency with which blacks and
Chicanos fail to respond to jury service notices, and
(3) the token $5 per diem paid jurors which precludes
those in low economic strata from serving as jurors.2
Petitioner concludes that "[i] n the 1968 South District
Jury Draw [from which his jury was selected], the cumulative effect of the . . . selection procedures . . . was

such that the percentage selected from a white middleclass comparison area was 13 times as great as the per-

centage selected from a low-income black comparison
area, and the exclusion of low-income Mexican-Americans
was virtually total."
The opinion of the Court of
Appeal and the argument of the respondent do not, in
my mind, sufficiently rebut the prima facie showing petitioner has 'made that he has been denied the equal protection of the laws by his conviction by a jury selected
2

,Even if it were assumed that these exclusions were the unavoidable consequences of Los Angeles' method of jury selection, it does
not follow that jury panels must be racially unrepresentative of
the community. The names of prospective jurors are selected by a
computer from voter registration lists. With modern sampling techniques, it would be a simple matter to program the computer
so that its initial selection of names would-after the operation of
these exclusions--yield a racially representative jury panel. Mills,
A Statistical Study of Occupations of Jurors in a United States
District Court, 22 Md. L. Rev. 205, 214 (1962).
"A selection system which is economically and racially unbalanced
by the application of juror quality tests can produce representative
panels if a larger percentage of those population segments which
tend to fail the tests is considered for jury service so that a fair
proportion of their members survive the selection process." Kuhn,
Jury Discrimination: The Next Phase, 41 S.Cal. L. Rev. 235, 315
(1968).

through racially biased procedures.' "If there has been
discrimination, whether accomplished ingeniously or ingenuously, the conviction cannot stand." Smith v.
Texas, 311 U. S. 128, 132 (1940). It would seem enough,
therefore, to reverse this conviction out of hand because
of the racial bias built into the jury selection and because
of the improper legal standard applied by the court
below.
The test in question was drafted in 1935 and it consists
of some 33 questions designed to measure vocabulary
and reading comprehension. The Jury Commissioner
testified that it was administered "[t] o see if a prospective
juror has sufficient knowledge of the English language,"
but expert scientific testimony indicated that the test
was "not a good measure . . . of average verbal ability."
The author of the examination, Psychology Professor Dr.
Neil Warren, testified that he validated the test and
established the passing score by administering it to some
100 to 200 white middle-class college students. Over
the years, the test questions themselves have remained
unchanged despite changes in the common vocabulary.'
At some point, however, the test was divided into two
parts and, for some inexplicable reason, the passing
grade was changed. Dr. Warren testified that these
changes would "reduce the reliability to the point where
[he] would not want to condone the results." Another
expert witness testified that the test was "completely
arbitrary to use in its present form."
4 The Court of Appeal argues, for example, that "It]he poor, the
Blacks and Mexican-Americans have the power to register to vote,
and voter registration is free and relatively uncomplicated." Be
this as it may, this argument is unresponsive to petitioner's contention that jurors are selected from lists which are racially unbalanced.
5 Evidence was adduced at trial which indicated that, even apart
from the unsupported changes in the grading of the examination,
the test was likely invalid solely because of its vintage and the.
unrepresentative sample used to validate it in 1935.

OCTOBER TERM, 1971

404 U. S.

While the test may have -been unreliable as a measure
of juror competence, it effectively excluded minority
group members from jury service. The rate of failure
in minority group areas was almost four times that in
a white, middle-class comparison area:
FailureRate
Area
Long Beach (white, middle-class) .... 13% (14/106)
Wilmington (48% Spanish surname)
and San Pedro (41% MexicanAmerican and 11% black) ......... 45% (23/51)
Central Long Beach (55% black) .... 48% (12/25)
District-wide ......................
18% (349/1937)
It would seem that this device is ill-suited to serve any
legitimate state interest and does serve to exclude from
jury panels significantly disproportionate numbers of
minority groups. The Constitution does not, of course,
require racially balanced juries because, in our pluralistic
society, a group of 12 men and women could not possibly
represent all of the ethnic, racial, and economic groups
which compose our diverse culture. Swain v. Alabama,
380 U. S. 202, 208 (1965) ; Cassell v. Texas, 339 U. S. 282,
286-287 (1950); Akins v. Texas, 325 U. S. 398 (1945).
What the Constitution demands, however, is that no such
groups be consciously excluded from the selection process. See Hill v. Texas, 316 U. S. 400, 404 (1942) ; Smith
v. Texas, 311 U. S. 128, 130 (1940); 5 U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights Report, Justice 89-103 (1961).
What the facts might show after oral argument, no
one knows. I would hold constitutionally infirm a conviction returned by a jury from which a disproportionately
large number of minority group members were excluded
through the use of a culturally biased intelligence test
where the test is shown to be unreliable as a measure of
jury competence. There is a prima facie showing that
this test is vulnerable. Accordingly, I would grant the
petition for a writ of certiorari.

RIDDELL V. RHAY, PENITENTIARY SU-

Sup. Ct. Wash. Certiorari denied.
Reported below: 79 Wash. 2d 248, 484 P. 2d 907.

PERINTENDENT.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

with whom MR. JUSTICE BREN-

concurs, dissenting.
Over the dissents of JUSTICES Black, BRENNAN, and
MARSHALL, and myself, this Court last Term held that
statements elicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966), may nevertheless be used to impeach the credibility of a defendant whose testimony in
his own behalf is inconsistent with those statements.
Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971). Denial of
certiorari in this case illustrates the rewards that
flow to those police interrogators who, deliberately
or otherwise, ignore the restrictions placed upon them
by Miranda-restrictions necessary to safeguard the privilege against self-incrimination and to insure the reliability of statements elicited in the police-dominated atmosphere of an incommunicado custodial interrogation.
Petitioner Riddell was convicted in state court of assault. The facts are undisputed. In the course of an
argument over the conduct of a neighbor's dog, a rifle
carried by Mr. Riddell discharged, the bullet striking his
neighbor in the foot. The only real issue at trial was
that of intent. Testifying in his own defense, Mr. Riddell said he did not intend that the rifle go off, and did
not have his finger on the trigger when it fired. On
cross-examination, however, the prosecution was permitted to confront Mr. Riddell with a statement elicited
from him, in violation of Miranda, in which he told the
police "I cocked the hammer and pulled the trigger. I
thought the rifle was aimed towards the ground and only
intended to scare Mr. Lewis." This statement was virtually a direct admission of the only element of the
offense at issue; and though it was introduced for the
NAN

"limited purpose" of "impeachment," it was certain to
have a prejudicial, if not conclusive, effect on the jury.
The possibility of using illegally obtained incriminating statements at trial, for any purpose, raises grave
questions concerning police noncompliance with Miranda.
It is undeniable that Miranda was predicated in part
upon a deep concern for discouraging coercive police practices. Eleven pages of the opinion are devoted to an
examination of police interrogation procedures. They
compel the conclusion that
"without proper safeguards the process of in-custody
interrogation of persons suspected or accused of
crime contains inherently compelling pressures which
work to undermine the individual's will to resist and
to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely." 384 U. S., at 467.
It is, of course, just this kind of testimonial compulsion that the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the
States by the Fourteenth, proscribes.
There is widespread agreement that police interrogation procedures are sensitive to the mandates of the
courts:
"IT]he predominant incentive for interrogation is
-to obtain evidence for use in court. Consequently,
police conduct in this area is likely to be responsive
to judicial rules governing the admissibility of that
evidence. 'There can be no doubt,' the President's
Crime Commission reported, that the Supreme
Court's rulings about interrogation procedures 'had
much to do with the fact that today the third degree
is almost nonexistent.'"
Oaks, Studying The Exclusionary Rule in Search and
Seizure, 37 U. Chi. L. Rev. 665, 722 (1970). See also
J. Wilson, Varieties of Police Behavior (1968). Thus, to
the extent that the use of incriminating statements elic-

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
DouoLs, J., dissenting

ited in violation of constitutional safeguards is prohibited, the police have no incentive to attempt to circumvent those safeguards.
There is the view that the use of Miranda-violative
statements does not affect the "fundamental fairness"
of the courtroom trial.* I cannot accept this position.
The lesson of Miranda is that the effective determination of guilt all too often rests on the ruses and stratagems employed in an incommunicado police interrogation,
not on the evidence and testimony elicited in the impartial surroundings of a trial court.
Yet, after Harris,there is no longer any real incentive
for police to obey Miranda. Credibility is always an
issue when an accused takes the stand in his own defense.
The license granted by the Harris majority to use Miranda-violative statements for impeachment purposes,
therefore, foreshadows the possible use of tainted statements in almost every case. This opens the door to a
calculated risk by police interrogators. If, in response
to Miranda warnings, an accused indicates he wishes to
have an attorney present during questioning, the request
may be ignored with virtual impunity. If a damaging
statement is thereafter forthcoming, it may almost certainly be used against the accused if he later elects to
take the stand in his own defense. Moreover, the risk
*This view is reflected in draft legislation recently submitted by
the Justice Department to the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. The proposed legislation would restrict federal
habeas corpus relief to constitutional rights which have as their
"primary purpose the protection of the reliability of either the
factfinding process at the trial or the appellate process on appeal
from the judgment of conviction." Habeas Corpus Amendments of
the Department of Justice, Letter to Hon. Sam J. Ervin, Jr., Oct. 19,
1971, Appendix ii. The covering letter expressly refers to the
use of Miranda-violative statements as a claim which would be
barred under the proposed amendments. Letter 16. But see
Dershowitz & Ely, Harris v. New York, 80 Yale L. J. 1198 (1971).

is minimal that the inability to use the statement in the
prosecution's case in chief will result in a dismissal of
the charges or a directed verdict of acquittal. Unlike
other situations in which exclusionary rules operate
to exclude illegally obtained physical evidence, it is leldom that a prima facie case requires corroboration from
the lips of the accused.
The accused may take cold comfort in the fact that if
he does take the stand, the tainted statements may only
be used for "impeachment." We have often noted the
impossible task that faces a jury instructed to close its
eyes to the fact that evidence introduced for a limited
purpose is highly damaging on the ultimate issue of
guilt as well. "The naive assumption that prejudicial
effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . . .
all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction."
Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U. S. 440, 453 (Jackson, J., concurring). See also Spencer v. Texas, 385
U. S. 554, 575 (opinion of Warren, C. J.). Cf. Bruton v.
United States, 391 U. S. 123; Jackson v. Denno, 378
U. S. 368.
It is no answer to say, as did the majority in Harris,
that the privilege against self-incrimination "cannot be
construed to include the right to commit perjury." 401
U. S., at 225. As we said in Miranda, the presence of
counsel during police questioning may help "to guarantee
that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the
police and that the statement is rightly'reported by the
prosecution at trial." 384 U. S., at 470. A statement
made in the inherently coercive, police-dominated atmosphere denounced in Miranda is not so reliable that we
can safely ignore its implicit involuntariness and the
critical burden the use of such a statement places upon
the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege.
The exclusionary rule is a recognition that the vision
of law enforcement authorities is often narrowed by

The black students in this case want nothing more
than to receive the same quality of education from our
public schools as is enjoyed by the whites. To deny
them that equality is to sanction the dispensation of
public benefits according to the invidious classification
of race.

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

404 U. S.

Appellants sought to convene a three-judge District
Court in order to challenge the constitutionality of
New Jersey's statutory scheme establishing the boundaries of school districts. They argue that by establishing school district lines to coincide with the boundaries of the State's political subdivisions, cf. N. J. Rev.
Stat. § 18A:8-1, the State imposed upon the public
schools patterns of racial imbalance in violation of the
Civil Rights Act of 1871, Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983. It is said in reply that New Jersey prescribes
school district boundaries only in conformity with municipal boundaries. There is, however, a showing that at
times a black has to walk further to his school than the
white school in his neighborhood. The remedy is redistricting. We have sponsored that process to protect
the right to vote. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S.533. The
right to education in the environment of a multi-racial
community seems equally fundamental.
The result, according to appellants, is an inferior
education for students of minority races-something this
Court has long condemned. McLaurin v. Oklahoma
State Regents, 339 U. S. 637; Sweatt v. Painter,339 U. S.
629; Sipuel v. Board of Regents, 332 U. S.631; Missouri
ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,305 U. S.337. See also Plessy
v. Ferguson,163 U. S.537; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.
356. Appellants sought either a redistricting or an appropriate racial balance in the public schools so that
educational opportunity would not be determined by
race, cf. Gomperts v. Chase, post, p. 1237, or compensatory
educational programs to correct the inferior schooling
given minority students. The District Court in that case
had rejected this approach, however, and dismissed the
complaint, finding refuge in de facto segregation. 329
F. Supp. 1192.
If any form of state-imposed segregation is proved,
then the racially homogeneous residential neighborhoods

J., dissenting

and the consequent racial imbalance in schools would
seem to be the result of state action.* " 'It is a question of
the power of the State as a whole,'" Mr. Justice Brandeis
*In this case the white exodus to the suburbs and the resultant
surrendej of the inner city to the blacks is evident. "In 1910, 73
per cent of the Negro population of the United States were rural;
in 1960, 73 per cent were urban." K. Taeuber & A. Taeuber, Negroes
in Cities 1 (1965). That shift in residential patterns has been both
encouraged and facilitated by federal, state, and local actions. In a
recent statement to the Senate Subcommittee on Education, the
United States Commission on Civil Rights indicated how pervasive
this governmental influence is:
"Even in those instances where school segregation is a result of
housing patterns with no apparent complicity of school officials,
government at all levels-local, State, or Federal-invariably is heavily implicated. Historically, racial zoning ordinances imposed by
local law were a formidable factor in creating and maintaining racially
exclusive neighborhoods. Although such ordinances were held unconstitutional as early as 1917, some communities continued to enforce
them, even as late as the 1950s.
"Judicial enforcement by State courts of racially restrictive covenants has been another 'mportant factor. Although these covenants
were private agreements to exclude members of designated minority
groups, the fact that they were enforceable by the courts gave them
maximum effectiveness. Not until 1948 was the judicial enforcement of such covenants held unconstitutional, and not until 1953
was their enforcement by way of money damages held unlawful.
Racially restrictive covenants no longer are judicially enforceable,
but they still appear in deeds and the residential patterns they helped
to create still persist.
"Various exercises of local governmental authority, such as decisions on building permits, the location of sewer and water facilities,
building inspection standards, zoning and land use requirements, and
the power of eminent domain have been used to exclude minority
group members from designated neighborhoods and even from entire
communities.
"The Federal Government, principally through its public housing
and FHA mortgage insurance programs, has been all too often a
willing partner in the creation and perpetuation of racially segregated
neighborhoods, even to the point of insisting upon them. Until the

said. "[T]he powers of the several state officials must
be treated as if merged in a single officer." Iowa-Des
Moines Bank v. Bennett, 284 U. S. 239, 244-245 (1931).
The Constitution condemns "discrimination, whether
accomplished ingeniously or ingenuously," Smith v.
Texas, 311 U. S. 128, 132 (1940), and where there has
been any such discrimination our "objective [is] ... to
eliminate from the public schools all vestiges of stateimposed segregation." Swann v. Board of Education, 402

U. S. 1, 15 (1971)

(emphasis added).

There is, moreover, an ancient American doctrine that

as, if, and when public facilities are separate for the races
late 1940s, for example, FHA insisted on racially restrictive covenants to insure against integrated housing developments. Until 1962
when the Executive Order on Equal Opportunity in Housing was
issued, the agency continued willingly to do business with discriminatory builders and developers. The Public Housing Administration
permitted its funds to be used for the creation and perpetuation of
segregated housing projects well after the courts had made it clear
that such practices were in violation of the Constitution. Other
Federal programs, such as the highway and urban renewal programs,
which involve massive displacement and relocation, also have had
the effect of intensifying residential segregation.
"The point we are making is that the current situation we face,
in which most minority group children attend school in isolation
from children of the majority group, is not accidental or purely
de facto. In many cases, it has resulted in whole or in substantial
part from an accumulation of governmental actions. Thus the
categorical distinction between de jure and de facto segregation is
not as clear-cut as it would appear. Upon closer examination, there
is probably little legal substance to the concept of de facto school
segregation. Further, in the Commission's view, the Government has
a moral as well as legal responsibility to undo the segregation it has
helped to create and maintain. There is no statute of limitations
by which government in its many forms can be exonerated from its
past misdeeds or relieved of its current obligations." Hearings before the Subcommittee on Education of the Senate Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 352-354 (1970).

ORDERS

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

they must be equal. Plessy v. Ferguson, supra, held
that a State could maintain separate facilities for different races providing the facilities were equal. We have
long since repudiated the notion that a State may maintain racially distinct facilities for the races, because classifications based upon race are invidious and thus violative
of the Fourteenth Amendment. But there can be
de facto segregation without the State's being implicated
in the creation of the dual system and it is in such situations that Plessy's mandate that separate facilities be
equal has continuing force. Our conclusion in Brown v.
Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 495, that "[s]eparate
educational facilities, are inherently unequal," has been
convincingly borne out. by scholarly studies. E. g.,
J. Coleman, Equality of Educational Opportunity (1966);
Harvard Educational Review, Equal Educational Opportunity (1969); Alexander & Campbell, Peer Influences
on Adolescent Educational Aspirations and Attainments,
29 Am. Socio. Rev. 568 (1964). This inequality led
Senator Mondale to conclude:
"In 1968, there were more than 43 million children in our public elementary and secondary schools.
9 million were from minority groups: 6.3 million
were black; 2 million were of Spanish origin; 194,000
were from Oriental backgrounds; 178,000 were
American Indian.
"Most of these children are from families living
in poverty. The vast majority are deprived of a
decent education throughout their lives. They go
to schools which are inferior-educationally, financially, and physically. They are years behind in
achievement. Few go on to higher education."
117 Cong. Rec. 10750.
Senator Javits recently summarized the problem:
"Whatever you call it, 'de facto segregation,' 'racial un-

balance,' or 'the absence of intergroup activity,' it is a
serious block to effective education for children of minority groups anywhere in the country, especially in the
north and central part of the country where you don't
have the established social order of segregation." Hearings on Emergency School Aid Act of 1970 before the

F. Supp. 1405.
dissenting.
In the 1970 Ohio primary election, appellant voted as
a Republican and was a candidate for the Republican
nomination to the House of Representatives from the 22d
Congressional District of Ohio. Political allegiances
change and, in the upcoming election, appellant seeks
the nomination to Congress of the American Independent Party. He is prevented from pursuing this nomination, however, by an intricate statutory scheme. Central to this scheme is a statute which provides, with
various exceptions not relevant here, e. g., Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. § 3517.013 et seq. (Supp. 1970), that "[n]o
person shall be a candidate for nomination or election
at a party primary if he voted as a member of a different political party at any primary election within the
next preceding four calendar years." Ohio Rev. Code
Ann. § 3513.191 (1960). Other provisions also being attacked require those working for primary candidates or
signing their nominating petitions to be members of the
party in which nomination is sought, id., § 3513.05 (Supp.
1970).
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

ORDERS
1032

DOUGLAS,

J., dissenting

No one disputes that Ohio's statutory scheme prevents
appellant from seeking the nomination of the party of
his choice before 1974. Appellees, however, defend this
limitation of freedom, saying that it is necessary to
ensure "the formation of recognizable, relatively stable
political parties with their own leadership, goals and
philosophies." They conclude, "The protection of these
purposes is a legitimate State concern." The District
Court adopted this rationale:
"The compelling State interest the Ohio Legislature seeks to protect by its contested statutes
is the integrity of all political parties and membership therein. These Ohio statutes seek to prevent
'raiding' of one party by members of another party
and to preclude candidates from '. . . altering their
political party affiliations for opportunistic reasons.'
State ex rel. Bible v. Board of Elections, 22 0. S. 2d
57, 258 N. E. 2d 227 (1970). Protection of party
membership uniformly applied to all parties cannot
be characterized as 'invidious discrimination' as defined in Williams [v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968)]."
337 F. Supp. 1405, 1406 (ND Ohio 1971).
Not only does the denial of appellant's right to seek
the nomination of the American Independent Party in
1972 seriously impair his right of political expression, but
the "compelling State interest" advanced by the appellees and accepted by the court below seems alien to our
political and constitutional heritage. The right to run
for public office seems a fundamental one.
The Ohio laws deny appellant that liberty, insofar as
the 1972 election is coneerned.
While I doubt that any state interest can be so compelling as to justify an impairment of associational
freedoms in the area of philosophy-poritical or other-

wise*-the reasons advanced by the court below require an answer. The District Court and the appellees
see a compelling state interest in the need to preserve the status quo and to preserve political stability.
This interest, it is argued, is secured by creating impediments to changes in party allegiance. Our history is
replete with instances in which politicians-having become disenchanted with their previous parties or perhaps
only for the "opportunistic" reasons condemned by the
court below-have changed from one party to another.
This list includes Teddy Roosevelt, Strom Thurmond,
Wayne Morse, John Lindsay, George Wallace, and a host
of others. Though these breaks from past political ties
add vitality to our political process, Ohio makes it very
difficult.
I would note probable jurisdiction and put the case
down for early argument.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN,

MR.

JUSTICE WHITE,

and MR.

JUSTICE POWELL:

We are three of the four who dissent from the affirmance of the judgment of the District Court in this case.
In the circumstances present here, however, we do not
insist that the case be set down for oral argument.
*In Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 39-40 (separate opinion),

I said:
"Cumbersome election machinery can effectively suffocate the
right of association, the promotion of political ideas and programs
of political action, and the right to vote. The .totality of Ohio's
requirements has those effects. It is unnecessary to decide whether

Ohio has an interest, 'compelling' or not, in abridging those rights
because 'the men who drafted our Bill of Rights did all the "balancing" that was to be done in this field.' Appellees would imply
that 'no kind of speech is to be protected if the Government can
assert an interest of sufficient weight to induce this Court to uphold
its abridgment.' I reject that suggestion." (Citations omitted.)

dissenting.
It seems incredible that under our federalism a State
can deny a student education in its public school system
unless his hair style comports with the standards of the
school board.
Some institutions in Asia require their enrollees to shave
their heads. Would we sustain that regulation if imposed by a public school?
Would we sustain a public school regulation requiring
male students to have crew cuts?
The present regulation-to some at least-seems as
extreme as the examples given. It provides:
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

"Hair shall be trim and clean. A boy's hair shall
not fall below the eyes in front and shall not cover
the ears, and it shall not extend below the collar in
back."
Robert Olff, a 15-year-old boy speaking through his
mother, has a full panoply of constitutional rights,
though he is a minor. We said in Tinker v. Des Moines
School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 511:
"Students in school as well as out of school are
'persons' under our Constitution. They are possessed
of fundamental rights which the State must respect,
just as they themselves must respect their obligations to the State."
Moreover, a parent's control over the child, though
not absolute, as witness our decisions placing sanctions
against child labor, is pervasive. We said in Prince v.
Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166:
"It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and
nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose

primary function and freedom include preparation
for obligations the state can neither supply nor
hinder. . . . And it is in recognition of this that
these decisions have respected the private realm of
family life which the state cannot enter."
Hair style is highly personal,' an idiosyncrasy which
I had assumed was left to family or individual control
and was of no legitimate concern to the State. It seems
to me to be as much a purely private choice as was the
family-student decision, sustained against a State's prohibition, to study the German language in a public school.
Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390. That family-student
right, the Court held, was included within "liberty" as
the word is used in the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at
400. Opposed there-as in the present case-is the
authoritarian philosophy favoring regimentation. The
Court said:
"In order to submerge the individual and develop
ideal citizens, Sparta assembled the males at seven
into barracks and intrusted their subsequent education and training to official guardians. Although
such measures have been deliberately approved by
men of great genius, their ideas touching the rela'Feelings run high among people concerning hair styles. Yet as
Professor Chafee said:
"This breach of the peace theory is peculiarly liable to abuse when
applied against unpopular expressions and practices. It makes a
man a criminal simply because his neighbors have no self-control

and cannot refrain from violence. The reductio ad absurdum of
this theory was the imprisonment of Joseph Palmer, one of Bronson
Alcott's fellow-settlers at 'Fruitlands,' not because he was a communist, but because he persisted in wearing such a long beard that
people kept mobbing him, until law and order were maintained by
shutting him up. A man does not become a criminal because some
one else assaults him, unless his own conduct is in itself illegal or
may be reasonably considered a direct provocation to violence."

tion between individual and State were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest;
and it hardly will be affirmed that any legislature
could impose such restrictions upon the people of a
State without doing violence to both letter and spirit
of the Constitution." Id., at 402.
The word "liberty" is not defined in the Constitution.
But, as we held in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479,
it includes at least the fundamental rights "retained by
the people" under the Ninth Amendment. Id., at 484.
One's hair style, like one's taste for food, or one's liking
for certain kinds of music, art, reading, recreation, is
certainly fundamental in our constitutional scheme-a
scheme designed to keep government off the backs of people.2 That is not to say that the police power of the
state is powerless to deal with known evils. An epidemic
of lice might conceivably authorize a shearing of locks.
Other like crises might be imagined. But I see no way
of allowig a State to set hair styles for patrons of its
schools, anymore than it could establish a welfare system
only for men with crew cuts and women with bobbed
2

"This Court takes judicial notice that hairstyles have altered

from time to time throughout the ages. Samson's locks symbolically
signified his virility. Many of the Founding Fathers of this country
wore wigs. President Lincoln grew a beard at the suggestion of a
juvenile female admirer. Chief Justice Hughes' beard furnished the
model for the frieze over the portico of the Supreme Court of thc
United States proclaiming 'equal justice under law.' Today many of
both the younger and older generations have avoided the increased
cost of barbering by allowing their locks or burnsides to grow to
greater lengths than when a haircut cost a quarter of a dollar.
"Whether hair styles be regarded as evidence of conformity or of
individuality, they are one of the most visible examples of personality.
This is what every woman has always known. And so have many
men, without the aid of an anthropologist, behavioral scientist,
psychiatrist, or practitioner of any of the fine arts or black arts."

hair.3 Once these lines are drawn, a serious question of
equal protection of the law is raised.
The federal courts are in conflict and the decisions in
disarray.' We have denied certiorari where the lower
In the 1920's the fad turned to short hair:
"To conservatives, short-haired women were as much 'radicals
and freaks of society' as long-haired musicians, artists, and anar3

chists. Some saw in bobbed hair a symbol of all the ills of the age,
ranging from jazz, short skirts, sexy movies, the automobile, and
prohibition to such threats as 'Freudian psychology' and the 'growing cult of the so-called free woman.' The boyish bob, followed by
the shingle and bingle which shaved the nape of the neck, and
then by the curly bob and spit curls, were all part of what the
older generation denounced as 'Flaming Youth.'
"Preachers took to pulpits to warn that 'a bobbed woman is a
disgraced woman.' In a Missouri courtroom, a mother pleading for
the return of her six children who had been living with a guardian
heard the oldest of them testify to the judge: 'We don't believe
mother is a Chri.tian woman. She bobs her hair.' Men divorced
their wives over bobbed hair. Other males banded together with
vows to give up shaving until wives agreed to let their hair grow
out again. A large deliartment store fired all bobbed haired employees and a hospital discharged bobbed haired nurses." W.
Severn, The Long And Short of It 122 (1971).
4In Ho Ah Kow v. Nunan, 12 Fed. Cas. 252, an alien Chinese was
allowed to recover damages under the Civil Rights Act against
the sheriff of San Francisco for cutting his hair "to an uniform
length of one inch from the scalp" on entering a prison to serve
a five-day sentence for a petty offense. The Circuit Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Field, held that the ordinance made an
invidious discrimination against the Chinese ("only the dread of the
loss of his queue will induce a Chinaman to pay his fines" id., at
255) and was a cruel and unusual punishment. Ibid.
5,"Long hair" cases have occasioned a deep division in the circuits. There is a conflict as to the extent that a student's interest
in his hair style enjoys constitutional protection, compare Br~en v.
Kahl, 419 F. 2d 1034 (CA7 1969), and Richards v. Thurston, 424 F.
2d 1281 (CA1 1970), with Ferrell v. Dallas Ind. School Dist., 392
F. 2d 697 (CA5 1968), and Jackson v. Dorrier,424 F. 2d 213 (CA6
1970). Where it has been found to exist, there is a split as to the
constitutional basis for such protection. Compare Breen, supra, with

with whom MR. JUSTICE

DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.

On March 4, 1964, petitioner was arraigned in the
United States District Court on charges of prison escape
and accompanying assaults. Counsel was appointed that
day, and after petitioner and the attorney assured the
court they had had sufficient time earlier in the day to

1050

404 U. S.

confer, the court accepted petitioner's guilty pleas. On
June 22, 1964, petitioner returned for sentencing, and
the following occurred:
"The Court: Mr. Robbins [sic], when [last] before
the Court, was represented by appointed counsel,
Mr. Sheldon Crossette, a member of the bar of Wyandotte County and of this Court.
"I excused Mr. Corssette [sic] from further representation of Mr. Robbins [sic] since he is in Kansas
City and this hearing is in Leavenworth.
"Mr. Robbins [sic], do you desire that other
counsel be appointed to represent you at this
hearing?
"Defendant Robbins [sic]: No.
"The Court: You understand that you have the
right to have counsel?
"Defendant Robbins [sic]: Yes.
"The Court: And you waive that right?
"Defendant Robbins [sic] : Yes, sir."
Petitioner was then sentenced to consecutive five-year
terms of imprisonment on two counts and a concurrent
five-year term on a third, all to follow any sentence then
being served.
Petitioner subsequently filed a motion in the sentencing court to vacate sentence under 28 U. S. C. § 2255, contending, first, that in summarily relieving his appointed
attorney, the trial court had denied him his constitutional
right to the assistance of counsel and, second, that he
had not validly waived his right to counsel. In particular, petitioner alleges that he did not accept the
court's offer to appoint new counsel for fear of angering
the court, and because he did not think a new attorney,
unfamiliar with the case, could help him. The District
Court in an unreported order denied relief without a

ORDERS
1049

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

hearing, on the ground that the records of the case "conclusively" demonstrated a valid waiver. The Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed in an unreported
per curiam opinion.
The principles governing this case are well established.
Petitioner, of course, had a constitutional right to counsel
at his sentencing proceedings. McConnell v. Rhay, 393
U. S. 2 (1968); Mempa v. Rhay, 389 U. S. 128 (1967).
Although the Constitution "does not require that under
all circumstances counsel be forced upon a defendant,"
Carter v. Illinois, 329 U. S. 173, 174-175 (1946), a waiver
of the right to counsel is valid only if it is voluntarily
and understandingly made. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S.
458 (1938).
"The fact that an accused may tell [the judge] that
he is informed of his right to counsel and desires to
waive this right does not automatically end the
judge's responsibility. To be valid such waiver must
be made with an apprehension of . .. all ... facts
essential to a broad understanding of the whole
matter." Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U. S. 708, 724
(1948).
Moreover, " 'courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver' of fundamental constitutional rights
and . . . we 'do not presume acquiescence in the loss of
fundamental rights.'" Johnson v. Zerbst, supra, at 464.
See also, e. g., Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 (1962);
Moore v. Michigan, 355 U. S. 155 (1957); Von Moltke v.
Gillies, supra; Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60
(1942). Finally, petitioner was entitled to "a prompt
hearing" on his motion "[u]nless the motion and the files
and records of the case conclusively show that the
prisoner [was] entitled to no relief . . . ." 28 U. S. C.
§ 2255. See, e. g., Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1
(1963).

OCTOBER TERM, 1971
BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

404 U. S.

Whether petitioner was properly denied a hearing presents a serious question. Nothing in the record suggests,
let alone demonstrates "conclusively," that petitioner's
statement of waiver of new counsel at sentencing was
made "with an apprehension of ...

all ...

facts essential

to a broad understanding of the whole matter." Von
Moltke v. Gillies, supra, at 724. Nothing reveals an
awareness on his part that the offer of new counsel was
more than "a mere procedural formality," id., at 722that counsel would have been appointed not merely to
stand by his side while the court pronounced sentence.
Nothing indicates an appreciation that a continuance
might have been granted to permit new counsel to familiarize himself with the case and render the services
that this Court has said are integral to " 'the very integrity of the fact-finding process.'" McConnell v. Rhay,
supra, at 3. On the contrary, the record offers some
support for petitioner's allegation that, although he
wanted meaningful representation, he felt he could not
press for it without antagonizing the court.
Moreover, the record is silent on any waiver of error
in the dismissal of petitioner's already appointed attorney, and that dismissal itself raises substantial constitutional questions. In Vellucci v. United States, 430
F. 2d 188 (1970), the Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit held it to be plain error for a trial judge to excuse
the defendant's attorney before sentencing. The Court
of Appeals below distinguished Vellucci on the ground
that the defendant there, unlike petitioner here, was not
offered new counsel. But an unaccepted offer of new
counsel can hardly render harmless any error in dismissing an already appointed attorney.
Lawyers are not necessarily fungible goods, to be replaced at the whim of the court. Counsel's prior experience in a case, his familiarity with the facts and
prior proceedings, and the position of trust he may have

ORDERS
January 17, 1972

404 U. S.

gained with the defendant are factors arguing for continued representation by the same attorney. This case
is barren of any indication that the interests of petitioner
were considered in the dismissal of his appointed counsel.
I would accordingly grant this petition for certiorari.

with whom MR. JUSTICE BREN-

I would grant certiorari in this case. Prison censorship of mail discovered a letter written by an inmate
which at the trial of the inmate was used to convict him.
The evils of censorship are thus compounded. The
right of privacy protected by the Bill of Rights (Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479) is re-emphasized
when government is dealing with a captive audience (see
Public Utilities Comm'n v. Pollak, 343 U. S. 451, 467469 (dissenting opinion)). It includes, inter alia, the
sanctity of thought and belief of the individual that
is protected by the First and Fifth Amendments. As
Mr. Justice Holmes said in Milwaukee Pub. Co. v. Burleson, 255 U. S. 407, 437 (dissenting) "the use of the
mails is almost as much a part of free speech as the
right to use our tongues." Under our regime the right
to use the mail free of censorship is basic whether the
censor be a federal official working for the post office or
a federal official working for the Department of Justice.
The problem is squarely raised here, free from all problems of prison security.
