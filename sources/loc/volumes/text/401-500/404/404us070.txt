COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC

WELFARE,

ET AL.

APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF MONTANA

No. 70-5376.

Decided November 16, 1971

157 Mont. 99, 4S3 P. 2d 720, reversed.
PER CURIAM.

The motion of the appellant for leave to proceed in
forma pauperis is granted.
Whether a welfare program is or is not federally funded
is irrelevant to the constitutional principles enunciated
in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618. The judgment
of the Supreme Court of Montana is reversed.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE is of the opinion that probable

jurisdiction should be noted and the case set for oral
argument.
