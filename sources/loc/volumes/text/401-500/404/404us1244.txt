OCTOBER TERM, 1971

Opinion in Chambers

404 U. S.

KADANS v. COLLINS ET AL.
ON APPLICATION

No. A-784 (71-463).

FOR TEMPORARY

RELIEF

Decided January 31, 1972

Application for temporary relief allowing petitioner to practice law
pending consideration of petition for rehearing by the Court
denied by JUSTICE DOUGLAS, because of the nature of the relief
requested and because he was not one of the majority who voted
to Oeny the petition for certiorari.
See: Ante, p. 1007.

Circuit Justice.
The petition for certiorari in this case was denied by
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

the Court on January 10, 1972, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN

and I noting that we voted to grant. Ante, p. 1007.
Petitioner now asks me for temporary relief allowing
him to practice law pending consideration by the Court
on a petition for rehearing. The difficulty is that the
grant of that relief would in effect be a partial grant of
relief sought in the petition for certiorari. I, one of the
dissenting Justices, am barred by our Rule 58 (1) from
voting on a petition for rehearing, those petitions being
considered only by those "who concurred in the judgment
or decision." Unless one of the majority who voted to
deny votes to reopen the case, the dissenters take no
part. If one who voted to deny changes his mind and
votes to grant the petition, then of course the entire
Court participates. But in light of this rule and in light
of our practice and in consideration of the nature of the
relief that is being asked of me, I herewith deny the
application.
