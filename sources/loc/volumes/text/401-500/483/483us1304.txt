OCTOBER TERM, 1986
Opinion in Chambers

483 U. S.

BOWEN, SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN
SERVICES v. KENDRICK ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-99.

Decided August 10, 1987

An application by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to stay a
District Court order enjoining the enforcement of parts of the Adolescent Family Life Act on constitutional grounds is granted, pending
timely docketing of the Secretary's appeal and this Court's ultimate disposition of the case. Given the presumption of constitutionality which
attaches to every Act of Congress, it is both likely that the Court will
note probable jurisdiction here and appropriate that the statute remain
in effect pending such review. Moreover, although the merits of the
case are fairly debatable, there is a reasonable prospect that the Court
will ultimately reverse the judgment below.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

Circuit Justice.

The applicant requests that I stay an order of the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia enjoining
the enforcement of parts of the Adolescent Family Life Act,
42 U. S. C. ยง 300z et seq. (1982 ed. and Supp. III). It has
been the unvarying practice of this Court so long as I have
been a Member of it to note probable jurisdiction and decide
on the merits all cases in which a single district judge declares an Act of Congress unconstitutional. In virtually all
of these cases the Court has also granted a stay if requested
to do so by the Government. "The presumption of constitutionality which attaches to every Act of Congress is not
merely a factor to be considered in evaluating success on the
merits, but an equity to be considered in favor of applicants
in balancing hardships." Walters v. National Association of
Radiation Survivors, 468 U. S. 1323, 1324 (1984) (REHNQUIST, J., in chambers). "Given the presumption of constitutionality granted to all Acts of Congress," it is both
likely that the Court will note probable jurisdiction here and
appropriate that the statute remain in effect pending such re-

Opinion in Chambers

Schweiker v. McClure, 452 U. S. 1301, 1303 (1981)

in chambers).
Respondents contend that the merits of the case are controlled by the Court's recent decisions in Wallace v. Jaffree,
472 U. S. 38 (1985), Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985),
and Grand Rapids School District v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373
(1985). The District Court agreed with respondents, but the
applicant contends that the merits are instead controlled by
cases such as Roemer v. Maryland Public Works Board, 426
U. S. 736 (1976), Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973), and
Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971). The issue seems
to me fairly debatable, and I believe that there is a "fair prospect" that the Court will ultimately reverse the judgment
below. See Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U. S. 1306, 1308 (1980)
(BRENNAN, J., in chambers).
The application for a stay pending timely docketing of the
applicant's appeal and this Court's ultimate disposition of the
case is granted.
