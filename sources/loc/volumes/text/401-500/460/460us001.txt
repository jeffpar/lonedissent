MOSES H. CONE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL v. MERCURY
CONSTRUCTION CORP.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
No. 81-1203.

Argued November 2, 1982-Decided February 23, 1983

Petitioner, a hospital located in North Carolina, entered into a contract
with respondent contractor, an Alabama corporation, for construction of
additions to the hospital building. Contract disputes were to be initially
referred to the architect who was hired to design and oversee the construction project. Disputes decided by the architect or not decided
within a specified time could be submitted to binding arbitration under
an arbitration clause in the contract. Subsequently, during construction, respondent submitted claims to the architect for extended overhead
or increase in construction costs due to petitioner's delay or inaction.
But the claims were not resolved, and petitioner refused to pay them.
Petitioner then filed an action in a North Carolina state court against respondent and the architect, seeking a declaratory judgment that there
was no right to arbitration, that petitioner was not liable to respondent,
and that if it was liable it would be entitled to indemnity from the architect. A few days later petitioner obtained an ex parte injunction from
the state court forbidding respondent to take any steps toward arbitration, but when respondent objected the stay was dissolved. Respondent then filed a diversity-of-citizenship action in Federal District Court,
seeking an order compelling.arbitration under § 4 of the United States
Arbitration Act. The District Court stayed the action pending resolution of the state-court suit because the two suits involved the identical
issue of the arbitrability of respondent's claims. The Court of Appeals,
holding that it had jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1291, reversed the

District Court's stay order and remanded the case with instructions to
enter an order to arbitrate.
Held:
1. The District Court's stay order was appealable as a "final decision"
to the Court of Appeals under 28 U. S. C. § 1291. Since the order was
based on the conclusion that the federal aid state actions involved the
identical issue of arbitrability, and this issue was the only substantive
issue present in the federal action, a stay of the federal action pending
resolution of the state action meant that there would be no further litigation in the federal court. Thus, respondent was "effectively out of
court" so that the stay order amounted to a dismissal of the federal action. Moreover, even if the stay order was not final for appealability
purposes, it was nevertheless appealable within the finality rule exception that applies where an order conclusively determines the disputed
question, resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits, and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541. Pp. 8-13.
2. The District Court abused its discretion in granting the stay.
Pp. 13-28.
(a) A federal district court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction
because of parallel state-court litigation only in exceptional circumstances; only the clearest of justifications will warrant dismissal. Colorado River Water ConservationDistrictv. United States, 424 U. S. 800,
818-819. The decision whether to stay or dismiss a federal action on
grounds of wise judicial administration does not rest on a mechanical
checklist but on a careful balancing of the important factors (which court
first assumed jurisdiction over property involved in the litigation, inconvenience of the federal forum, avoidance of piecemeal litigation, and the
order in which the concurrent forums obtained jurisdiction) relevant to
the decision as they apply in a given case, with the balance heavily
weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction. Ibid. Pp. 13-16.
(b) The exceptional-circumstances test set forth in ColoradoRiver,
supra, was not undermined by Will v. CalvertFire Insurance Co., 437
U. S. 655. Pp. 16-19.
(c) There was no showing of the requisite exceptional circumstances
to justify the District Court's stay order. Concededly, there was no assumption by either court of jurisdiction over any res or property or any
contention that the federal court was any less convenient to the parties
than the state court. The other factors-avoidance of piecemeal litigation and the order in which the current forums obtained jurisdictionrather than supporting the stay, counsel against it. The fact that if respondent obtains an arbitration order, petitioner will be forced to resolve

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP.

Syllabus
the dispute with respondent and the related dispute with the architect in
different forums is not the result of any choice between federal and state
courts but occurs because the relevant federal law, the Arbitration Act,
requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement. Hence, a decision to allow the issue of arbitrability to be decided in federal rather than state court does not cause
piecemeal resolution of the parties' underlying disputes. And the fact
that the state-court suit was filed before the federal suit is not sufficient
reason to justify thetay order, where because petitioner's refusal to arbitrate did not occur until less than a day before it fied its state suit,
respondent had no reasonable opportunity to file its federal suit first.
Moreover, priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint was filed first, but rather in terms of how much progress has been
made in the two actions. Here, no substantial proceedings had taken
place in the state suit at the time of the District Court's stay order,
whereas in the federal suit the parties had taken most of the steps necessary to a resolution of the arbitrability issue. The stay order thus frustrated the Arbitration Act's policy of rapid and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration agreements. Pp. 19-23.
(d) The fact that federal law in the terms of the Arbitration Act governs the issue of the arbitrability of the dispute between petitioner
and respondent in either the state or the federal court is another factor
militating against the District Court's stay order. See Calvert, supra.
Pp. 23-26.
(e) Finally, an important reason against allowing a stay is the probable inadequacy of the state suit to protect respondent's rights, since it is
doubtful that respondent could obtain from the state court an order compelling petitioner to arbitrate. Pp. 26-27.
(f) The fact that the District Court stayed the federal action rather
than dismissing it outright does not render the ColoradoRiver exceptional-circumstances test inapplicable. Pp. 27-28.
3. The Court of Appeals acted within its authority in deciding that the
contractual dispute was arbitrable under the Arbitration Act and the
contract, where the court had briefs and evidentiary submissions from
both parties on the merits of arbitrability. P. 29.

Petitioner Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital (Hospital) is
located in Greensboro, N. C. Respondent Mercury Construction Corp. (Mercury), a construction contractor, has its
principal place of business in Alabama. In July 1975, Mercury and the Hospital entered into a contract for the construction of additions to the Hospital building. The contract,
drafted by representatives of the Hospital, included provisions for resolving disputes arising out of the contract or its
breach. All disputes involving interpretation of the contract
or performance of the construction work were to be referred
in the first instance to J. N. Pease Associates (Architect), an
independent architectural firm hired by the Hospital to design and oversee the construction project. With certain

stated exceptions,' any dispute decided by the Architect (or
not decided by it within a stated time) could be submitted by
either party to binding arbitration under a broad arbitration
clause in the contract:
"All claims, disputes and other matters in question
arising out of, or relating to, this Contract or the breach
thereof. . . . shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association then obtaining
unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. This
agreement to arbitrate shall be specifically enforceable
under the prevailing arbitration law. The award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final, and judgment
may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law
in any court having jurisdiction thereof." App. 29-30.
The contract also specified the time limits for arbitration
demands.2
Construction on the project began in July 1975. Performance was to be completed by October 1979.3 In fact, construction was substantially completed in February 1979, and
final inspections were made that June.
'The Architect was given final say on "matters relating to artistic effect." App. 28-29. The contract also excluded arbitration on any claim
waived by the making or acceptance of final payment. Id., at 29. Neither of these exceptions is asserted to apply in this case.
2The contract provided that no demand for arbitration could be made
later than 30 days after the Architect's written final decision. In the case
of arbitrable disputes not subject to submission to the Architect, the demand was required to be made "within a reasonable time after the claim
... has arisen," and in no event after the applicable statute of limitations
had run. Id., at 29-30.
The contract also set a starting time limit for arbitration demands. No
demand could be made earlier than 10 days after presentation of evidence
to the Architect, unless the Architect rendered a written decision before
that time. Id., at 29.
'The completion date, originally set as November 14, 1978, was extended to October 1979 by agreement of the parties.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

460 U. S.

At a meeting in October 1977 (during construction), attended by representatives of Mercury, the Hospital, and the
Architect, Mercury agreed, at the Architect's request, to
withhold its claims for delay and impact costs (i. e., claims for
extended overhead or increase in construction costs due to
delay or inaction by the Hospital) until the work was substantially completed. On this record, the Hospital does not contest the existence of this agreement, although it asserts that
the Architect lacked authority to agree to a delay in presentation of claims or to entertain claims after the contract work
was completed.
In January 1980, Mercury submitted to the Architect its
claims for delay and impact costs. Mercury and the Architect discussed the claims over several months, substantially
reducing the amount of the claims. According to the Hospital, it first learned of the existence of Mercury's claims in
April 1980; its lawyers assumed active participation in the
claim procedure in May. The parties differ in their characterizations of the events of the next few months-whether
there were "ongoing negotiations," or merely an "investigation" by the Hospital. In any event, it appears from the
record that lawyers for the Hospital requested additional
information concerning Mercury's claims. As a result, on
August 12, 1980, Mercury gave a detailed presentation of its
claims at a meeting attended by Mercury's representatives
and lawyers, the Hospital's representatives and lawyers, and
representatives of the Architect. Mercury agreed to send
copies of its files to an expert hired by the Hospital, and the
parties agreed to meet again on October 13.
On October 6, Mercury's counsel telephoned the Hospital's
counsel to confirm that the scheduled meeting would go forward. The Hospital's counsel said he would call back the
next day. When he did, he informed Mercury's counsel that
the Hospital would pay nothing on Mercury's claim. He also
said that the Hospital intended to file a declaratory judgment
action in North Carolina state court.

Opinion of the Court

True to its word, the Hospital filed an action on the morning of October 8 in the Superior Court of Guilford County,
N. C., naming Mercury and the Architect as defendants.
The complaint alleged that Mercury's claim was without factual or legal basis and that it was barred by the statute of
limitations. It alleged that Mercury had lost any right to arbitration under the contract due to waiver, laches, estoppel,
and failure to make a timely demand for arbitration. The
complaint also alleged various delinquencies on the part of
the Architect. As relief, the Hospital sought a declaration
that there was no right to arbitration; a stay of arbitration; a
declaration that the Hospital bore no liability to Mercury; and
a declaration that if the Hospital should be found liable in any
respect to Mercury, it would be entitled to indemnity from
the Architect. The complaint was served on Mercury on
October 9. On that same day, Mercury's counsel mailed a
demand for arbitration.
On October 15, without notice to Mercury, the Hospital obtained an ex parte injunction from the state court forbidding
Mercury to take any steps directed toward arbitration.
Mercury objected, and the stay was dissolved on October 27.
As soon as the stay was lifted, Mercury filed the present
action in the District Court, seeking an order compelling
arbitration under § 4 of the Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 4.4
Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. On the
Hospital's motion, the District Court stayed Mercury's
federal-court suit pending resolution of the state-court suit
because the two suits involved the identical issue of the
arbitrability of Mercury's claims. App. to Pet. for Cert.
A-38.
4 Simultaneously, Mercury filed a petition for removal of the Hospital's
state-court action. The District Court remanded the removed case on the
ground that, because the Hospital and the Architect are both North Caro-

lina corporations, there was no complete diversity. The propriety of the
removal or remand is not before this Court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

460 U. S.

Mercury sought review of the District Court's stay by both
a notice of appeal and a petition for mandamus. A panel of
the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit heard argument
in the case, but before the panel issued any decision, the
court informed the parties that it would consider the case en
banc. After reargument, the en banc court held that it had
appellate jurisdiction over the case under 28 U. S. C. § 1291.
It reversed the District Court's stay order and remanded the

case to the District Court with instructions for entry of an
order to arbitrate.
II
Before we address the propriety of the District Judge's
stay order, we must first decide whether that order was appealable to the Court of Appeals under 28 U. S. C. § 1291.6
Mercury sought appellate review through two alternative
routes-a notice of appeal under § 1291, and a petition for
mandamus under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1651.6
Mercury expressly stated that its appeal was based only on
§ 1291, and not on 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (relating to interlocutory appeals). The Hospital contends that the order appealed from was not a "final decisio[n]" within § 1291. We
'Section 1291 provides in relevant part:
"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States ....
except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court."
6The
Hospital argues that because Mercury's filing in the Court of Appeals was styled a petition for mandamus first and a notice of appeal only
"in the alternative," the Hospital was somehow entitled to have the Court
of Appeals apply the stricter standards of review that obtain under the
mandamus procedure before considering any appeal. Brief for Petitioner
30-31. We do not understand why this order of proceeding would be of
any benefit to the Hospital; but in any event the contention is frivolous.
In the first place, Mercury also filed a proper notice of appeal in the District Court, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(a). More fundamentally, a court
of appeals has no occasion to engage in extraordinary review by mandamus
"in aid of [its] jurisdictio[n]," 28 U. S. C. § 1651, when it can exercise the
same review by a contemporaneous ordinary appeal. See, e. g., Hines v.
D'Artois, 531 F. 2d 726, 732, and n. 10 (CA5 1976).

Opinion of the Court

disagree and hold that the stay order was final for purposes
of appellate jurisdiction.
Idlewild Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U. S. 713 (1962), is
instructive in this regard. There the plaintiff brought a federal suit challenging the constitutionality of a state statute.
The District Judge declined to convene a three-judge court
and stayed the federal suit under the Pullman abstention
doctrine.7 We held that the District Court's action was final
and therefore reviewable by the Court of Appeals, stating:
"The Court of Appeals properly rejected the argument
that the order of the District Court 'was not final and
hence unappealable under 28 U. S. C. §§ 1291, 1292,'
pointing out that '[a]ppellant was effectively out of
court."' 370 U. S., at 715, n. 2.8

RailroadComm'n v. Pullman Co., 312 U. S. 496 (1941).
plaintiff in Idlewild had requested injunctive relief against enforce-

8The

ment of the state statute. Nevertheless, it is clear that neither the Court
of Appeals nor this Court based the holding of appealability on the argument that the District Court had effectively denied injunctive relief. See
generally 28 U. S. C. § 1292(a)(1); Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450
U. S. 79 (1981). Section 1292 in terms applies only to interlocutory orders, and therefore could hardly have been the basis for a holding that the
orders were "final."
There is no basis for the dissent's attempt, post, at 33, to distinguish
Idlewild on the basis that in that case there was no pending state-court action when the District Court's stay issued. Neither the Court of Appeals
nor this Court suggested in Idlewild that the state court's doors were anything but wide open to the plaintiff. "[E]ffectively out of court" means effectively out of federal court-in keeping with the fact that the decision
under appeal is the refusal to exercise federaljurisdiction.
Moreover, the dissent's resolution of the appealability issue would yield
the odd result that Pullman abstention orders would be immediately appealable in Texas but not in the other 49 States. Compare American
Trial Lawyers Assn. v. New Jersey Supreme Court, 409 U. S. 467 (1973)
(stays appropriate in Pullmancases), with HarrisCounty Commissioners
Court v. Moore, 420 U. S. 77, 88-89, and n. 14 (1975) (dismissal permissible
to accommodate Texas jurisdictional requirements). This oddity illustrates the artificiality of resting appealability on an otherwise substanceless distinction between stays and dismissals in the present context. See
Part IV-E, infra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

460 U. S.

Here, the argument for finality of the District Court's
order is even clearer. A district court stay pursuant to Pullman abstention is entered with the expectation that the federal litigation will resume in the event that the plaintiff does

not obtain relief in state court on state-law grounds.'

Here,

by contrast, the District Court predicated its stay order on
its conclusion that the federal and state actions involved "the
identical issue of arbitrability of the claims of Mercury Construction Corp. against the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38. That issue of arbitrability was the only substantive issue present in the federal suit.
Hence, a stay of the federal suit pending resolution of the

state suit meant that there would be no further litigation in
the federal forum; the state court's judgment on the issue
would be res judicata. 1° Thus, here, even more surely than
in Idlewild, Mercury was "effectively out of court." Hence,
as the Court of Appeals held, this stay order amounts to a
dismissal of the suit."

515-516 (CA3 1978) (dictum).
Of course, as these cases recognize, Idlewild does not disturb the usual
rule that a stay is not ordinarily a final decision for purposes of § 1291, since

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 11
1

Opinion of the Court

In any event, if the District Court order were not final for
appealability purposes, it would nevertheless be appealable

within the exception to the finality rule under Cohen v.
Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949).

The factors

required to show finality under this exception have been
summarized as follows:
"To come within the 'small class' of decisions excepted
from the final-judgment rule by Cohen, the order must
conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an
important issue completely separate from the merits of
the action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal
most stays do not put the plaintiff "effectively out of court." See, e. g.,
Amdur, supra, at 105-106. Idlewild's reasoning is limited to cases where
(under ColoradoRiver, abstention, or a closely similar doctrine) the object
of the stay is to require all or an essential part of the federal suit to be
litigated in a state forum.
This answers the dissent's argument, post, at 33-34, that Idlewild was
overruled by that part of Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U. S.463,
469-477 (1978), which rejected the "death knell" doctrine of appealability.
The "death knell" doctrine rested on the argument that in some situations
an interlocutory decision (such as a refusal to certify a class) might terminate a suit as a practical matter because the named plaintiff would lack an
economic incentive to pursue his individual claim. In a "death knell" case,
however, the order sought to be appealed had no legal effect on the named
plaintiff's ability to proceed with his individual claim in federal court.
There is an obvious difference between a case in which the plaintiff himself
may choose not to proceed, and a case in which the district court refuses to
allow the plaintiff to litigate his claim in federal court. Appeal from a stay
on abstention or ColoradoRiver grounds, therefore, presents no prospect
of "appeals of right from nonfinal orders that turn on the facts of a particular case," as in Coopers & Lybrand, supra, at 476. We foresee no great
difficulty in determining when a district court has surrendered jurisdiction
over a federal lawsuit.
For much the same reason, the dissent errs in likening the stay in this
case to an ordinary delay in the interest of docket control, post, at 30-31.
We do not hold that an order becomes final merely because it may have the
practical effect of allowing a state court to be the first to rule on a common
issue. We hold only that a stay order is final when the sole purpose and
effect of the stay are precisely to surrender jurisdiction of a federal suit to
a state court.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982

from a final judgment." Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay,
437 U. S. 463, 468 (1978) (footnote omitted).12
There can be no dispute that this order meets the second
and third of these criteria. An order that amounts to a refusal to adjudicate the merits plainly presents an important
issue separate from the merits."3 For the same reason, this
order would be entirely unreviewable if not appealed now.
Once the state court decided the issue of arbitrability, the
federal court would be bound to honor that determination as
res judicata.
The Hospital contends nevertheless that the District
Court's stay order did not meet the first of the criteria,
namely that it "conclusively determine the disputed question." But this is true only in the technical sense that every
order short of a final decree is subject to reopening at the discretion of the district judge. 4 In this case, however, there is
12Accord, Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U. S. 368, 375
(1981); United States v. MacDonald,435 U. S. 850, 854-855 (1978); Abney
v. United States, 431 U. S. 651, 658-659 (1977).
3
The "completely separate from the merits" requirement is a distillation
of the principle that there should not be piecemeal review of "steps towards
final judgment in which they will merge." Cohen v. Beneficial Loan
Corp., 337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949). In this case, of course, there is no step
towards final judgment, but a refusal to proceed at all.
1See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(b); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper,
Federal Practice and Procedure § 4478, pp. 788-792 (1981).
Coopers & Lybrand held that the Cohen rule did not apply to a class decertification order because, among other reasons, such an order is "inherently tentative" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1), which provides that such an order may be "altered or amended before the decision on
the merits." 437 U. S., at 469, and n. 11. Of course, as Rule 54(b) provides, virtually all interlocutory orders may be altered or amended before
final judgment if sufficient cause is shown; yet that does not make all pretrial orders "inherently tentative" in the sense of that phrase in Coopers &
Lybrand. The rationale behind Rule 23(c)(1) is that a certification decision
should be made "[als soon as practicable," even though later events or discoveries may mandate a different result. Many other orders, by contrast,
are made with the expectation that they will be the final word on the sub-

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 13

Opinion of the Court

no basis to suppose that the District Judge contemplated any
reconsideration of his decision to defer to the parallel statecourt suit. He surely would not have made that decision in
the first instance unless he had expected the state court to
resolve all relevant issues adequately. See Part IV-E,
infra. It is not clear why the judge chose to stay the case
rather than to dismiss it outright; for all that the record
shows, there was no reason other than the form of the Hospital's motion. Whatever the reason, however, the practical
effect of his order was entirely the same for present purposes, and the order was appealable.
III
We turn now to the principal issue to be addressed,
namely, the propriety of the District Court's decision to stay
this federal suit out of deference to the parallel litigation
brought in state court. ColoradoRiver Water Conservation
Districtv. United States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976), provides persuasive guidance in deciding this question.
A
Colorado River involved the effect of the McCarran
Amendment, 66 Stat. 560, 43 U. S. C. § 666, on the existence
and exercise of federal-court jurisdiction to adjudicate federal
water rights, 28 U. S. C. § 1345. The Amendment waives
the Government's sovereign immunity to permit the joinder
of the United States in some state-court suits for the adjudication of water rights. In Colorado River, however, the
Government proceeded in Federal District Court, bringing
suit against some 1,000 nonfederal water users, seeking a
declaration of the water rights of certain federal entities and
Indian tribes. Shortly thereafter, a defendant in that suit
ject addressed. Certainly that was true of the order at issue in this case.
The reasoning of Coopers & Lybrand does not reach all pretrial orders that
are formally subject to revision, but only those as to which some revision
might reasonably be expected in the ordinary course of litigation.

water rights within the river system that was the subject of
the federal-court suit. The District Court dismissed the federal suit, holding that the abstention doctrine required deference to the state-court proceedings. The Court of Appeals
for the Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that the suit of the
United States was within the District Court's jurisdiction
under 28 U. S. C. § 1345 and that abstention was inappropriate. We reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing the
complaint.
We began our analysis by examining the abstention doctrine in its various forms. We noted:
"Abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is
the exception, not the rule. 'The doctrine of abstention,
under which a District Court may decline to exercise or
postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction, is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a District
Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.
Abdication of the obligation to decide cases can be justified under this doctrine only in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the
State court would clearly serve an important countervailing interest."' 11
After canvassing the three categories of abstention, we concluded that none of them applied to the case at hand. 424
U. S., at 813-817.16
Nevertheless, we held that the District Court's dismissal

doctrine apply to this case.

tional decisions, as does abstention, but on "considerations of
'[w]ise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation
of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation."' " 17 We noted that "'the pendency of an action in the
state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction,"' and that the
federal courts have a "virtually unflagging obligation.., to
exercise the jurisdiction given them." 18 We continued:
"Given this obligation, and the absence of weightier
considerations of constitutional adjudication and statefederal relations, the circumstances permitting the dismissal of a federal suit due to the presence of a concurrent state proceeding for reasons of wise judicial
administration are considerably more limited than the
circumstances appropriate for abstention. The former
circumstances, though exceptional, do nevertheless
exist." Id., at 818.
We declined to prescribe a hard-and-fast rule for dismissals
of this type, but instead described some of the factors relevant to the decision.
"It has been held, for example, that the court first
assuming jurisdiction over property may exercise that
jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts ....

In as-

sessing the appropriateness of dismissal in the event of
an exercise of concurrent jurisdiction, a federal court
may also consider such factors as the inconvenience of
the federal forum; the desirability of avoiding piecemeal
litigation; and the order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums. No one factor is necessarily determinative; a carefully considered judgment

diction and the combination of factors counselling against
that exercise is required. Only the clearest ofjustifications will warrantdismissal." Id., at 818-819 (emphasis added; citations omitted).
As this passage makes clear, the decision whether to dismiss a federal action because of parallel state-court litigation
does not rest on a mechanical checklist, but on a careful balancing of the important factors as they apply in a given case,
with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of
jurisdiction. The weight to be given to any one factor may
vary greatly from case to case, depending on the particular
setting of the case. Colorado River itself illustrates this
principle in operation. By far the most important factor in
our decision to approve the dismissal there was the "clear
federal policy... [of] avoidance of piecemeal adjudication of
water rights in a river system," id., at 819, as evinced in the
McCarran Amendment. We recognized that the Amendment represents Congress' judgment that the field of water
rights is one peculiarly appropriate for comprehensive treatment in the forums having the greatest experience and expertise, assisted by state administrative officers acting under
the state courts. Id., at 819-820. In addition, we noted
that other factors in the case tended to support dismissalthe absence of any substantial progress in the federal-court
litigation; the presence in the suit of extensive rights governed by state law; the geographical inconvenience of the
federal forum; and the Government's previous willingness to
litigate similar suits in state court. Id., at 820.
B
Before discussing the application of Colorado Rivers exceptional-circumstances test, we must address the Hospital's
argument that that test was undermined by our subsequent
decision in Will v. CalvertFire InsuranceCo., 437 U. S. 655
(1978). We find no merit in this argument for at least two
reasons.

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 17
1

Opinion of the Court

The Hospital relies on the opinion of JUSTICE REHNQUIST,
announcing the judgment of the Court. The Hospital argues
that JUSTICE REHNQUIST's opinion, if not expressly overruling Colorado River, at least modifies its holding substantially. But it is clear that a majority of the Court reaffirmed
the Colorado River test in Calvert. JUSTICE REHNQUIST's

opinion commanded only four votes. It was opposed by the
dissenting opinion, in which four Justices concluded that the
Calvert District Court's stay was impermissible under Colorado River. 437 U. S., at 668-669, 672-674 (BRENNAN, J.,
joined by BURGER, C. J., and MARSHALL and POWELL, JJ.,
dissenting). JUSTICE BLACKMUN, although concurring in
the judgment, agreed with the dissent that ColoradoRiver's

exceptional-circumstances test was controlling; he voted to
remand to permit the District Court to apply the Colorado
River factors in the first instance.' 9 437 U. S., at 667-668.
On remand, the Court of Appeals correctly recognized that
the four dissenting Justices and JUSTICE BLACKMUN formed

a majority to require application of the ColoradoRiver test.
Calvert Fire Insurance Co. v. Will, 586 F. 2d 12 (CA7
1978).
"Our decision in Colorado River came down after the District Court's
stay order in Calvert but before the Court of Appeals issued its mandamus
in that case.
2 On remand from our decision in Calvert, the District Court and Court
of Appeals concluded that the stay should be continued, but rested that decision on a ground not addressed in the prior Court of Appeals decision
(CalvertFireInsuranceCo. v. Will, 560 F. 2d 792 (CA7 1977)) or in any of
this Court's opinions in the case. They concluded that the filing of the federal suit was a "defensive tactical maneuver" based on a contrived federal
claim; hence, a stay was called for as "a means to deter vexatious use of the
federal courts." The courts also noted that, in the interim, the basis for
the plaintiff's assertion of exclusive federal jurisdiction had vanished.

Even on the basis of JUSTICE REHNQUIST's opinion, however, there is an obvious distinction between Calvert and this
case. The key to Calvert was the standard for issuance of a
writ of mandamus under 28 U. S. C. § 1651.21 As JUSTICE
REHNQUIST stressed, such extraordinary writs are used in
aid of appellate jurisdiction only to confine an inferior court
to a lawful exercise of its prescribed authority, or to compel it
to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so. The
movant must show that his right to the writ is clear and indisputable. 437 U. S., at 661-662, 664, 665-666 (opinion of
REHNQUIST, J.). JUSTICE REHNQUIST concluded that the
movant in Calvert had failed to meet this burden. At the
same time, he noted that the movant might have succeeded
on a proper appeal. Id., at 665. In this case we have held
that the Court of Appeals did have appellate jurisdiction; it
properly exercised that jurisdiction to find that the District
Court's stay was impermissible under Colorado River.
The Hospital further contends that Calvert requires reversal here because the opinions of JUSTICE REHNQUIST and
court suit was a contrived, defensive reaction to Mercury's expected claim
for relief and for arbitration. 656 F. 2d, at 944-945.
The reasoning of the Courts of Appeals in this case and in Calvert-that
the vexatious or reactive nature of either the federal or the state litigation
may influence the decision whether to defer to a parallel state litigation
under Colorado River-has considerable merit. We need not rely on such
reasoning here, however, for we conclude infra that even if the Hospital
acted in complete good faith there were no exceptional circumstances warranting the District Court's stay.
21The Court of Appeals in Calvert had held that it lacked jurisdiction to
entertain an ordinary appeal, apparently because a portion of the federal
litigation was the subject of exclusive federal jurisdiction and would therefore remain to be disposed of in federal court after the conclusion of statecourt proceedings. CalvertFire InsuranceCo. v. Will, 560 F. 2d, at 794,
citing Cotler v. Inter-County OrthopaedicAssn., 526 F. 2d 537, 540 (CA3
1975). Cf. Drexler v. Southwest Dubois School Corp., 504 F. 2d, at 838
(stay of litigation pending exhaustion of state remedies is final under
Idlewild). The issue of appellate jurisdiction was not presented to this
Court in Calvert.

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 19
1

Opinion of the Court

JUSTICE BLACKMUN require greater deference to the discre-

tion of the District Court than was given by the Court of Appeals in this case. Under both Calvert and ColoradoRiver,
of course, the decision whether to defer to the state courts is
necessarily left to the discretion of the district court in the
first instance. Yet to say that the district court has discretion is not to say that its decision is unreviewable; such discretion must be exercised under the relevant standard prescribed by this Court. In this case, the relevant standard is
Colorado River's exceptional-circumstances test, as elucidated by the factors discussed in that case. As we shall now
explain, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the District
Court in this case abused its discretion in granting the stay.
IV
Applying the ColoradoRiver factors to this case, it is clear
that there was no showing of the requisite exceptional circumstances to justify the District Court's stay.
The Hospital concedes that the first two factors mentioned
in Colorado River are not present here. There was no assumption by either court of jurisdiction over any res or property, nor is there any contention that the federal forum was
any less convenient to the parties than the state forum. The
remaining factors-avoidance of piecemeal litigation, and the
order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums-far from supporting the stay, actually counsel against
it.
A
There is no force here to the consideration that was paramount in Colorado River itself-the danger of piecemeal
litigation.
The Hospital points out that it has two substantive disputes here-one with Mercury, concerning Mercury's claim
for delay and impact costs, and the other with the Architect,
concerning the Hospital's claim for indemnity for any liability
it may have to Mercury. The latter dispute cannot be sent

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
Opinion of the Court

460 U. S.

to arbitration without the Architect's consent, since there is
no arbitration agreement between the Hospital and the Architect. It is true, therefore, that if Mercury obtains an arbitration order for its dispute, the Hospital will be forced to
resolve these related disputes in different forums. That misfortune, however, is not the result of any choice between the
federal and state courts; it occurs because the relevant federal law requirespiecemeal resolution when necessary to give
effect to an arbitration agreement.' Under the Arbitration
Act, an arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the
underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement.2 If
the dispute between Mercury and the Hospital is arbitrable
under the Act, then the Hospital's two disputes will be resolved separately-one in arbitration, and the other (if at all)
in state-court litigation. Conversely, if the dispute between
Mercury and the Hospital is not arbitrable, then both disputes will be resolved in state court. But neither of those
two outcomes depends at all on which court decides the question of arbitrability. Hence, a decision to allow that issue to
be decided in federal rather than state court does not cause
piecemeal resolution of the parties' underlying disputes. AlSThis provides a sharp contrast with the key statute at issue in Colorado
River-the McCarran Amendment. There, as we stressed, the primary
policy of the statute was the avoidance of piecemeal litigation. 424 U. S.,
at 819-820.
1E. g., C. Itoh & Co. v. Jordan International Co., 552 F. 2d 1228,
1231-1232 (CA7 1977); Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Industries, Inc., 514
F. 2d 614, 617 (CA1 1975); Hamilton Life Insurance Co. v. Republic National Life Insurance Co., 408 F. 2d 606, 609 (CA2 1969).
In some cases, of course, it may be advisable to stay litigation among the
nonarbitrating parties pending the outcome of the arbitration. That decision is one left to the district court (or to the state trial court under applicable state procedural rules) as a matter of its discretion to control its
docket. See generally Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248,
254-255 (1936).

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 21
1

Opinion of the Court

though the Hospital will have to litigate the arbitrability
issue in federal rather than state court, that dispute is easily
severable from the merits of the underlying disputes.
B
The order in which the concurrent tribunals obtained and
exercised jurisdiction cuts against, not for, the District
Court's stay in this case. The Hospital argues that the stay
was proper because the state-court suit was filed some 19
days before the federal suit. In the first place, this argument disregards the obvious reason for the Hospital's priority in filing. An indispensable element of Mercury's cause of
action under § 4 for an arbitration order is the Hospital's refusal to arbitrate. See n. 27, infra. That refusal did not
occur until less than a day before the Hospital fied its state
suit. Hence, Mercury simply had no reasonable opportunity
to file its § 4 petition first. Moreover, the Hospital succeeded in obtaining an ex parte injunction from the state
court forbidding Mercury to take any steps to secure arbitration.? Mercury filed its § 4 petition the same day that the
injunction was dissolved.'
That aside, the Hospital's priority argument gives too mechanical a reading to the "priority" element of the Colorado
River balance. This factor, as with the other Colorado
River factors, is to be applied in a pragmatic, flexible manner
with a view to the realities of the case at hand. Thus, priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint
was ified first, but rather in terms of how much progress has
been made in the two actions. Colorado River illustrates
I Of course we do not mean to say that the state court's injunction could
properly have been applied to prevent Mercury from filing or prosecuting a
federal lawsuit. See General Atomic Co. v. Felter, 434 U. S. 12 (1977);
Donovan v. City of Dallas, 377 U. S. 408 (1964). Mercury was not
obliged, however, to put itself in danger of contempt sanctions merely in
order to cut short the period of the Hospital's priority of filing.
'See also n. 20, supra.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982

460 U. S.

this point well. There, the federal suit was actually ified
first. Nevertheless, we pointed out as a factor favoring dismissal "the apparent absence of any proceedings in the District Court, other than the filing of the complaint, prior to the
motion to dismiss." 424 U. S., at 820. Here, the opposite
was true. It was the state-court suit in which no substantial
proceedings (excepting only the abortive temporary injunction) had taken place at the time of the decision to stay. In
the federal suit, by contrast, the parties had taken most of
the steps necessary to a resolution of the arbitrability issue.2
In realistic terms, the federal suit was running well ahead of
the state suit at the very time that the District Court decided
to refuse to adjudicate the case.
This refusal to proceed was plainly erroneous in view of
Congress' clear intent, in the Arbitration Act, to move the
parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible. The Act provides two
parallel devices for enforcing an arbitration agreement: a
stay of litigation in any case raising a dispute referable to arbitration, 9 U. S. C. § 3, and an affirmative order to engage
in arbitration, § 4. Both of these sections call for an expeditious and summary hearing, with only restricted inquiry
into factual issues.Y Assuming that the state court would
I Under § 6 of the Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 6, Mercury's application
for a § 4 order was properly treated procedurally as a motion. Mercury
submitted affidavits, legal briefs, and documentary evidence in support of
the order sought. The Hospital responded with full briefing and extensive
evidentiary submissions on the arbitrability issue, and it requested oral argument and a jury trial. At the same time, it made its successful motion
for a stay. It is readily apparent that if the District Court had denied the
stay, it doubtless could and should have gone on to decide the arbitrability
point in very short order.
I Section 3 provides that if a suit is brought on the merits of a dispute
covered by an arbitration agreement, "the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding
is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of
one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been
had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 23
Opinion of the Court

have granted prompt relief to Mercury under the Act,2 there
still would have been an inevitable delay as a result of the

District Court's stay. The stay thus frustrated the statutory
policy of rapid and unobstructed enforcement of arbitration
agreements.
C
Besides the four factors expressly discussed in Colorado
River, there is another that emerges from Calvert--the fact
that federal law provides the rule of decision on the merits.
The state-versus-federal-law factor was of ambiguous relevance in Colorado River.' In Calvert, however, both the
four-vote dissenting opinion and JUSTICE BLACKMUN's opinion concurring in the judgment pointed out that the case involved issues of federal law. 437 U. S., at 667 (BLACKMUN,
J., concurring in judgment); id., at 668-677 (BRENNAN,. J.,
for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration." 9
U. S. C. §3.
Section 4 provides that a district court must enter an order to arbitrate
"upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or
the failure to comply therewith is not in issue." If either of these points is
in issue, § 4 provides that "the court shall proceed summarily" to a trial on
that point. Section 6 further provides that a request for relief under
either § 3 or § 4 is to be treated procedurally as a motion.
Moreover, the policy of the Arbitration Act requires a liberal reading of
arbitration agreements, see infra, at 24-25. As a result, some issues that
might be thought relevant to arbitrability are themselves arbitrable-further speeding the procedure under §§ 3 and 4. See, e. g., PrimaPaint
Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U. S.395 (1967).
'See n. 34, infra; but cf. nn. 35, 36, infra.
Although the dissenting Justices in ColoradoRiver relied on this point,
see 424 U. S., at 825-826, the majority concluded that the federal/state law
point was not controlling for two reasons. First, there was an affirmative
policy in federal law expressly approving litigation of federal water rights
in state court-the McCarran Amendment. Second, although the water
rights of the United States and the Indian tribes were governed in part by
federal law, the bulk of the litigation would necessarily revolve around the
state-law water rights of the thousand nonfederal parties in the case-a
factor on which we expressly relied in approving the District Court's stay.
Id., at 820.

dissenting). See also Colorado River, 424 U. S., at 815,
n. 21. It is equally apparent that this case involves federal
issues.
The basic issue presented in Mercury's federal suit was the
arbitrability of the dispute between Mercury and the Hospital. Federal law in the terms of the Arbitration Act governs
that issue in either state or federal court. Section 2 is the
primary substantive provision of the Act, declaring that a
written agreement to arbitrate "in any maritime transaction
or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce
... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon
such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of
any contract." 9 U. S. C. § 2.10 Section 2 is a congressional
declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration
agreements, notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary. The effect of the section is to
create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of
the Act. In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.
Corp., 388 U. S. 395 (1967), for example, the parties had
signed a contract containing an arbitration clause, but one
party alleged that there had been fraud in the inducement of
the entire contract (although the alleged fraud did not go to
the arbitration clause in particular). The issue before us was
whether the issue of fraud in the inducement was itself an arbitrable controversy. We held that the language and policies of the Act required the conclusion that the fraud issue
was arbitrable. Id., at 402-404. Although our holding in
Prima Paint extended only to the specific issue presented,
the Courts of Appeals have since consistently concluded that
questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy
regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration. We agree.
The Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal
law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues
o"Maritime transactions" and "commerce" are defined in § 1 of the Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 1.

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 25
Opinion of the Court

should be resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation
of waiver, delay, or a like defense to
3'
arbitrability.
To be sure, the source-of-law factor has less significance
here than in Calvert, since the federal courts' jurisdiction to
enforce the Arbitration Act is concurrent with that of the
state courts.2 But we emphasize that our task in cases such
as this is not to find some substantial reason for the exercise
of federal jurisdiction by the district court; rather, the task is
to ascertain whether there exist "exceptional" circumstances,
the "clearest of justifications," that can suffice under Colo31E. g., Dickinson v. Heinold Securities, Inc., 661 F. 2d 638, 643 (CA7

1360-1361 (CA10 1971).
'See n. 34, infra.
The Arbitration Act is something of an anomaly in the field of federalcourt jurisdiction. It creates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate, yet it does
not create any independent federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1331 (1976 ed., Supp. V) or otherwise. Section 4 provides for an order
compelling arbitration only when the federal district court would have jurisdiction over a suit on the underlying dispute; hence, there must be diversity of citizenship or some other independent basis for federal jurisdiction
before the order can issue. E. g., Commercial Metals Co. v. Balfour,
Guthrie, & Co., 577 F. 2d 264, 268-269 (CA5 1978), and cases cited. Section 3 likewise limits the federal courts to the extent that a federal court
cannot stay a suit pending before it unless there is such a suit in existence.
Nevertheless, although enforcement of the Act is left in large part to the
state courts, it nevertheless represents federal policy to be vindicated by
the federal courts where otherwise appropriate.
We need not address whether a federal court might stay a state-court
suit pending arbitration under 28 U. S. C. §2283.

rado River to justify the surrenderof that jurisdiction.

Al-

though in some rare circumstances the presence of state-law
issues may weigh in favor of that surrender, see n. 29, supra,

the presence of federal-law issues must always be a major
consideration weighing against surrender.Y
D
Finally, in this case an important reason against allowing a
stay is the probable inadequacy of the state-court proceeding

to protect Mercury's rights. We are not to be understood to
impeach the competence or procedures of the North Carolina
courts. Moreover, state courts, as much as federal courts,

are obliged to grant stays of litigation under §3 of the Arbitration Act.3 It is less clear, however, whether the same
3
is true of an order to compel arbitration under § 4 of the Act.
We need not resolve that question here; it suffices to say that
there was, at a minimum, substantial room for doubt that
Mercury could obtain from the state court an order compelCf. n. 20, supra.
Although § 3 refers ambiguously to a suit "in any of the courts of the
United States," the state courts have almost unanimously recognized that
the stay provision of § 3 applies to suits in state as well as federal courts,
requiring them to issue the same speedy relief when a dispute is referable
to arbitration. (The North Carolina Supreme Court has so held, although
not until after the District Court ordered this stay. Burke County Public
Schools Board of Education v. Shaver Partnership,303 N. C. 408, 279
S. E. 2d 816 (1981).) This is necessary to carry out Congress' intent to
mandate enforcement of all covered arbitration agreements; Congress can
hardly have meant that an agreement to arbitrate can be enforced against a
party who attempts to litigate an arbitrable dispute in federal court, but
not against one who sues on the same dispute in state court. See also
PrimaPaint,388 U. S., at 404.
Section 4, unlike § 3, speaks only of a petition to "any United States
district court." Nonetheless, at least one state court has held that § 4 does
require state courts to issue § 4 orders to arbitrate where the section's conditions are met. Main v. MerrillLynch, Pierce, Fenner& Smith Inc., 67
Cal. App. 3d 19, 24-25, 136 Cal. Rptr. 378, 380-381 (1977).

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 27

Opinion of the Court

ling the Hospital to arbitrate." In many cases, no doubt, a
§ 3 stay is quite adequate to protect the right to arbitration.
But in a case such as this, where the party opposing arbitration is the one from whom payment or performance is sought,
a stay of litigation alone is not enough. It leaves the recalcitrant party free to sit and do nothing-neither to litigate nor
to arbitrate. If the state court stayed litigation pending arbitration but declined to compel the Hospital to arbitrate,
Mercury would have no sure way to proceed with its claims
except to return to federal court to obtain a § 4 order-a
pointless and wasteful burden on the supposedly summary
and speedy procedures prescribed by the Arbitration Act.
E
The Hospital argues that the ColoradoRiver test is somehow inapplicable because in this case the District Court
merely stayed the federal litigation rather than dismissing
the suit outright, as in Colorado River. It contends that
Mercury remains free to seek to reopen the federal suit on a
showing that the state suit has failed to adjudicate its rights,
and that a stay is less onerous than a dismissal. We have
already rejected this distinction, for purposes of this case, in
discussing appellate jurisdiction. Supra, at 12-13. We reject it in this context for the same reasons.
"'As a historical matter, there was considerable doubt at the time of the
District Court's stay that the North Carolina court would have granted
even a § 3 stay of litigation.

The then-controlling precedent in North Car-

olina was to the effect that a contract such as that between Mercury and
the Hospital was not subject to the Arbitration Act at all, on the reasoning
that a construction project is not "commerce" within the meaning of §§ 1
and 2 of the Act. Burke County Public Schools Board of Education v.
Shaver Partnership,46 N. C. App. 573, 265 S. E. 2d 481 (1980); BryantDurhamElectric Co. v. Durham County Hospital Corp., 42 N. C. App.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982

Opinion of the Court

460 U. S.

We have no occasion in this case to decide whether a dismissal or a stay should ordinarily be the preferred course of
action when a district court properly finds that Colorado
River counsels in favor of deferring to a parallel state-court
suit. 37 We can say, however, that a stay is as much a refusal

to exercise federal jurisdiction as a dismissal. When a district court decides to dismiss or stay under ColoradoRiver, it
presumably concludes that the parallel state-court litigation
will be an adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution of the issues between the parties. If there is any substantial doubt as to this, it would be a serious abuse of discretion to grant the stay or dismissal at all. See Part IV-D,
supra; McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U. S. 668,
674-676 (1963). Thus, the decision to invoke ColoradoRiver
necessarily contemplates that the federal court will have
nothing further to do in resolving any substantive part of the
case, whether it stays or dismisses. See 17 C. Wright,
A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure
§4247, pp. 517-519 (1978).
Moreover, assuming that for some unexpected reason the
state forum does turn out to be inadequate in some respect,
the Hospital's argument fails to make out any genuine difference between a stay and a dismissal. It is true that Mercury
could seek to return to federal court if it proved necessary;
but that would be equally true if the District Court had dismissed the case. It is highly questionable whether this
Court would have approved a dismissal of a federal suit in
ColoradoRiver (or in any of the abstention cases, see supra,
at 14) if the federal courts did not remain open to a dismissed
plaintiff who later demonstrated the inadequacy of the state
forum.
IThis reservation, of course, applies only to cases under ColoradoRiver.
Cf., e. g., American Trial Lawyers Assn. v. New Jersey Supreme Court,
409 U. S. 467 (1973) (stay rather than dismissal in Pullman abstention).

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 29
Opinion of the Court

V
In addition to reversing the District Court's stay, the
Court of Appeals decided that the underlying contractual dispute between Mercury and the Hospital is arbitrable under
the Arbitration Act and the terms of the parties' arbitration
agreement. It reversed the District Court's judgment and
remanded the case "with directions to proceed in conformity herewith." 656 F. 2d, at 946. In effect, the Court of
Appeals directed the District Court to enter a §4 order to
arbitrate.
In this Court, the Hospital does not contest the substantive correctness of the Court of Appeals' holding on arbitrability. It does raise several objections to the procedures the
Court of Appeals used in considering and deciding this case.
In particular, it points out that the only issue formally appealed to the Court of Appeals was the propriety of the District Court's stay order. Ordinarily, we would not expect
the Court of Appeals to pass on issues not decided in the District Court. In the present case, however, we are not disposed to disturb the court's discretion in its handling of the
case in view of the special interests at stake and the apparent
lack of any prejudice to the parties. Title 28 U. S. C. §2106
gives a court of appeals some latitude in entering an order to
achieve justice in the circumstances. The Arbitration Act
calls for a summary and speedy disposition of motions or petitions to enforce arbitration clauses. The Court of Appeals
had in the record full briefs and evidentiary submissions from
both parties on the merits of arbitrability, and held that there
were no disputed issues of fact requiring a jury trial before a
§ 4 order could issue. Under these circumstances, the court
acted within its authority in deciding the legal issues presented in order to facilitate the prompt arbitration that Congress envisaged.
Affirmed.

and

In its zeal to provide arbitration for a party it thinks deserving, the Court has made an exception to established rules
of procedure. The Court's attempt to cast the District
Court's decision as a final judgment fails to do justice to the
meaning of the word "final," to the Act of Congress that limits the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals, or to the district
judges who administer the laws in the first instance.
If the District Court had not stayed the proceeding, but
had set a trial date two months away, there would be no
doubt that its order was interlocutory, subject to review only
by mandamus or pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292(b). This
would be true even though §4 of the Arbitration Act provides
that "the court shall proceed summarily" to trial, because an
order setting a trial date only guides the course of litigation,
and does not, of its own force, dispose of it on the merits.
Such an order is tentative; that is, it is subject to change at
any time on the motion of a party or by the court, sua sponte.
The order the District Court actually entered is no more
final. It delayed further proceedings until the completion of
pending litigation in the state courts. This order was also
tentative; it was subject to change on a showing that the
state proceedings were being delayed, either by the Hospital
or by the court, or that the state courts were not applying the
federal Act, or that some other reason for a change had
arisen. This order did not dispose of the case on the merits.
If the state court had found that there was no agreement to
arbitrate within the meaning of the United States Arbitration Act, the District Court would have been bound by that
finding. But res judicata or collateral estoppel would apply
if the state court reached a decision before the District Court
in the absence of a stay. The likelihood that a state court of
competent jurisdiction may enter a judgment that may determine some issue in a case does not render final a federal district court's decision to take a two-day recess, or to order ad-

ditional briefing by the parties in five days or five months, or
to take a case under advisement rather than render an immediate decision from the bench. Such a possibility did not
magically change that character of the order the District
Judge entered in this case.
Section 1291 of the Judicial Code is a congressional command to the federal courts of appeals not to interfere with the
district courts' management of ongoing proceedings. Unless
the high standards for a writ of mandamus can be met, or the
district court certifies an interlocutory appeal pursuant to
§ 1292(b), Congress has directed that the district courts be
permitted to conduct their cases as they see fit. The reason
for this rule is simple:
"Since the right to a judgment from more than one court
is a matter of grace and not a necessary ingredient of justice, Congress from the very beginning has, by forbidding piecemeal disposition on appeal of what for practical
purposes is a single controversy, set itself against enfeebling judicial administration. Thereby is avoided the
obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate
appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation
may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment.
To be effective, judicial administration must not be
leaden-footed. Its momentum would be arrested by
permitting separate reviews of the component elements
in a unified cause." Cobbledick v. United States, 309
U. S. 323, 325 (1940) (Frankfurter, J., for a unanimous

Court).
The Court's decision places an unwarranted limitation upon
the power of district courts to control their own cases. The
Court's opinion does not establish a broad exception to § 1291,
see ante, at 10-11, n. 11, but it does create uncertainty about
when a district court order in a pending case can be appealed.
This uncertainty gives litigants opportunities to disrupt or
delay proceedings by taking colorable appeals from interlocu-

tory orders, not only in cases nearly identical to this but also
in cases which the ingenuity of counsel disappointed by a district court's ruling can analogize to this one. Section 1291
established a policy that district judges should conduct their
own cases from beginning to end. The occasional injustice to
a litigant that results from an erroneous district court decision is far outweighed by the far greater systemic disruption
created by encouraging parties to attempt interlocutory appeals. The former attracts the Court's attention because the
legal error it perceives is apparent on the surface of the case.
The latter receives inadequate attention because it does not
appear in published decisions or in petitions for certiorari.
It is, rather, obscured by the "merits" of cases and hidden
among statistics on the cost and seeming interminable nature
of litigation. Both respect for district judges and concern for
the course of litigation generally should make the Court hesitate before creating another exception, however narrow, to
§ 1291.
The Court has acknowledged the importance of the rule of
finality as recently as Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437
U. S. 463 (1978), which rejected the so called "death knell"
exception to § 1291. In Coopers, a putative representative
plaintiff whose motion for class certification had been denied
by the District Court sought to appeal under § 1291. We accepted his argument that this order effectively put him out of
court, id., at 470, but held that this circumstance did not justify an exception to the statute. "[A]llowing appeals of right
from nonfinal orders that turn on the facts of a particular case
thrusts appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process and thus defeats one vital purpose of the final-judgment
rule---'that of maintaining the appropriate relationship between the respective courts ....
This goal, in the absence
of most compelling reasons to the contrary, is very much
worth preserving."' Id., at 476 (quoting Parkinsonv. April
Industries, Inc., 520 F. 2d 650, 654 (CA2 1975) (concurring
opinion)).

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 33
REHNQUIST, J., dissenting

The Court has not given any sound, principled justification
for permitting the Court of Appeals to thrust itself into the
trial process in this case. It begins by citing Idlewild Liquor
Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U. S. 713 (1962). There the District
Court had stayed an action challenging the constitutionality
of a state statute "to give the state courts an opportunity to
pass upon the constitutional issues presented, although there
was no relevant litigation then pending in the state courts."
Id., at 714. This Court held that the order was appealable
because the plaintiff "was effectively out of court." Id., at
715, n. 2. Idlewild does not control this case.
First, Mercury is less "effectively out of court" than was
Idlewild. There was no pending state proceeding that might
have resolved the issues in the case, and Idlewild might well
have been obliged to take the risk of violating the statute and
challenging it in an enforcement proceeding in state court.
More importantly, however, the decision in Idlewild cannot be good law after Coopers, supra. The Court describes
Coopers as holding only that the collateral-order doctrine of
Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949), does
not apply to a class decertification order under Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1). Ante, at 12-13, n. 14. We did
hold that "the collateral-order doctrine is not applicable to" a
decertification order. 437 U. S., at 468-469. We then went
on to reject the argument that the decertification order was
final under the so-called "death knell" doctrine, holding that
an order does not become final simply because the plaintiff
will be unable to pursue his claim if the order stands. Id., at
469-477. We declined to attach any importance to the fact
that the plaintiff in Coopers was just as "effectively out of
court" as Idlewild or Mercury. We noted that "if the 'death
knell' doctrine has merit, it would apply equally to the many
interlocutory orders in ordinary litigation ... that may have
such tactical economic significance that a defeat is tantamount to a 'death knell' for the entire case." Id., at 470.
We also noted that 28 U. S. C. § 1292(b) provides for review

of certain nonfinal orders, and that the "death knell" doctrine
circumvents its restrictions. 437 U. S., at 474-475. By ignoring this discussion and holding from Coopers, the Court
has created an unjustified exception to § 1291.
The Court also states that the stay order in this case is appealable under Cohen, supra. It quotes the formulation of
the Cohen collateral-order doctrine from Coopers:
"[T]he order must conclusively determine the disputed
question, resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and be effectively
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment." 437
U. S., at 468, quoted, ante, at 11-12.
The District Court's order did not "conclusively determine
the disputed question" for the reasons stated above. The
Court's assertion to the contrary, ante, at 12-13, is nothing
short of sheer speculation about the state of mind of the District Judge. Such speculation is hardly the "practical rather
than ...

technical construction"'* of § 1291 contemplated by

Cohen, supra, at 546. In Cohen itself, the District Court denied the defendant's motion to require the plaintiff to post a
bond on the ground that the statute requiring the bond did
not apply. That order "conclusively determined" the question whether a bond was required because no conceivable
change of circumstances could affect the basis of the District
Court's decision. In this case, any number of plausible
events might have convinced the District Court that a necessary basis of its decision-that the state court would proceed
promptly and fairly to adjudicate the issue of the existence of
an agreement to arbitrate-no longer applied.
*As a practical matter, it is not at all clear to me that the Court of Appeals' course would have provided arbitration more quickly than that of the
District Court, even if this Court had not granted certiorari. If the Court
of Appeals was correct that this dispute is plainly arbitrable, there is no
reason to expect that the state courts would not have resolved that issue in
the 11 months during which the case was before the Court of Appeals.

MOSES H. CONE HOSPITAL v. MERCURY CONSTR. CORP. 35
REHNQUIST, J., dissenting

Furthermore, I am not as certain as is the Court that by
staying this case the District Court resolved "an important
issue." An issue should not be deemed "important" for these
purposes simply because the court of appeals or this Court
thinks the appellant should prevail. The issue here was
whether the factual question whether there was an agreement to arbitrate should be adjudicated in a state or federal
court. Unless there is some reason to believe that the state
court will resolve this factual question wrongly, which the
Court quite rightly disclaims, ante, at 26, I do not see how
this issue is more important than any other interlocutory
order that may place a litigant at a procedural disadvantage.
For these reasons, I do not believe the District Court's
order was appealable. Interlocutory orders are committed
by statute to the judgment of the district courts, and this
Court ill-serves the judges of those courts and the overwhelming majority of litigants by devising exceptions to
the statute when it believes a particular litigant has been
wronged.
Given my view of appealability, I do not find it necessary to
decide whether the District Court's order was proper in this
case. I am disturbed, however, that the Court has sanctioned an extraordinary departure from the usual and accepted course of judicial proceedings by affirming the Court
of Appeals decision on an issue that was not decided in the
District Court.
The Court of Appeals ordered the District Court to enter
an order compelling arbitration, even though that issue was
not considered by the District Court. This Court has maintained the difference between appellate jurisdiction and original jurisdiction at least since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch
137, 174-176 (1803) ("It is the essential criterion of appellate
jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in
a case already instituted"). I do not understand how the
Court can say that the Court of Appeals had discretion to
perform a nonappellate act.

OCTOBER TERM, 1982
REHNQUIST, J., dissenting

460 U. S.

The Court relies on 28 U. S. C. § 2106, which provides that
a court of appeals
"may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse any
judgment, decree, or order of a court lawfully brought
before it for review, and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment, decree, or
order, or require such further proceedings to be had as
may be just under the circumstances."
This statute does not grant the courts of appeals authority to
constitute themselves as trial courts. Section 4 of the Arbitration Act gives the Hospital a right to a jury trial. See
ante, at 23, n. 27. By deciding that there were no disputed
issues of fact, the Court of Appeals seems to have decided a
motion for summary judgment that was not before it. This
is the kind of issue that district judges decide every day in
the ordinary course of business. It is not the kind of issue
that courts of appeals determine. The Court of Appeals did
have before it the memoranda filed in the District Court but,
contrary to the Court's intimation, ante, at 29, this issue was
not argued in the Court of Appeals. See 656 F. 2d 933, 948,
n. 1 (1981) (Hall, J., dissenting) ("No one argued that this
court should decide that issue").
There was no reason to believe that the District Court
would not have acted promptly to resolve the dispute on the
merits after being reversed on the stay. That judges of a
court of appeals believe they know how a case should be decided is no reason for them to substitute their own judgment
for that of a district judge without regard to the normal
course of appellate procedure.
The judgment below should be vacated and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to dismiss
the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Failing that, even if the
Court is correct that the stay order was an error, the judgment should be reversed insofar as it decides the question of
arbitrability, and the case should be remanded to the District
Court for further proceedings under the Arbitration Act.
