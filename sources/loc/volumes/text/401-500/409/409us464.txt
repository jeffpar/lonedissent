APPEAL

FROM

THE

UNITED

THE NORTHERN

No. 72-603.

STATES

DISTRICT

COURT FOR

DISTRICT OF GEORGIA

Decided January 15, 1973

District Court, which granted appellees an injunction against enforcement of § 203 (a) of the Social Security Act, erred in assuming
jurisdiction under Tucker Act, which does not authorize suits for
equitable relief.
346 F. Supp. 494, vacated and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

Appellees are illegitimate children on whose behalf a
class action was commenced seeking to enjoin enforcement of § 203 (a) of the Social Security Act, 49 Stat.
623, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 403 (a), on the ground
that the provision was unconstitutional under this Court's
decisions in Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406
U. S. 164 (1972), and Levy v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 68
(1968). The District Court granted appellees' request
for declaratory and injunctive relief.
On the merits, this appeal involves the same issues
that were raised in Davis v. Richardson, 342 F. Supp. 588
(Conn.), aff'd, post, p. 1069, and Griffin v. Richardson,
346 F. Supp. 1226 (Md.), aff'd, post, p. 1069. Unlike
those cases, however, the District Court here purported
to predicate its jurisdiction on the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C.
§ 1346 (a)(2). Assuming, arguendo, that exhaustion of
the administrative remedies provided by the Social Security Act was not a prerequisite to appellees' attack on
the facial constitutionality of § 203 (a), see Public Utilities Comm'n of California v. United States, 355 U. S.
534 (1958), we nonetheless conclude that it was error for

the District Court to assume jurisdiction under the
Tucker Act.
The Tucker Act plainly gives district courts jurisdiction over claims against the United States for money
damages of less than $10,000 that are "founded ...upon
the Constitution. '' * But the Act has long been contrued as authorizing only actions for money judgments
and not suits for equitable relief against the United
States. See United States v. Jones, 131 U. S. 1 (1889).
The reason for the distinction flows from the fact that
the Court of Claims has no power to grant equitable
relief, see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530, 557
(1962) (Harlan, J., announcing the judgment of the
Court), and the jurisdiction of the district courts under
the Act was expressly made "concurrent with the Court
*The Act, in pertinent part, reads as follows:
"(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, con-

current with the Court of Claims, of:
"(2) Any other [excepting certain tax cases] civil action or claim
against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded
either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied

contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated
damages in cases not sounding in tort."
The Act was passed in 1887. 24 Stat. 505. As enacted, the Act
read in terms of "[a]ll claims" rather than "[a]ny other civil
action or claim." Appellees suggest that the added phrase was
intended to broaden the scope of district court jurisdiction to include
"actions" for injunctions as well as "claims" for monetary damages.
The phrase, however, did not appear in the 1940 edition of the
Judicial Code, 28 U. S. C. § 41 (20), and appears to have been
inserted during the revision in 1948, without any suggestion
that the change was to affect the section's substance. In any event,
the corresponding section dealing with the concurrent jurisdiction
of the Court of Claims contains no such addition. See 28 U. S. C.
§ 1491.

of Claims." See United States v. Sherwood, 312 U. S.
584, 589-591 (1941); Bates Mfg. Co. v. United States,
303 U. S. 567, 570 (1938). What was said in Sherwood,
supra, at 591, applies here:
"[T]he Tucker Act did no more than authorize the
District Court to sit as a court of claims and ... the
authority thus given to adjudicate claims against
the United States does not extend to any suit which
could not be maintained in the Court of Claims."
Although appellees contend that jurisdiction was properly asserted under various alternative provisions of the
Judicial Code, the District Court did not pass upon the
applicability of those other provisions. Accordingly, appellees' motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted, the judgment is vacated, and the case remanded
to the District Court for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
