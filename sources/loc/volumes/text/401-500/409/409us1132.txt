OCTOBER TERM, 1972

REPORTER'S NOTE
Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates (together with related amendments to the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure* and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) were prescribed by order of the Court on
November 20, 1972, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. §§ 3402, 3771,
and 3772, and 28 U. S. C. §§ 2072 and 2075, and were reported to Congress at the beginning of its next regular
session by THE CHIEF JUSTICE on January 4, 1973, and
resubmitted on February 5, 1973.
The rules and amendments were to have become
effective July 1, 1973, as provided in the Court's orders.
However, by the Act of Mar. 30, 1973, Pub. L. 93-12,
87 Stat. 9, the foregoing rules and amendments are to
have no force or effect except to the extent, and with
such amendments, as may be expressly approved by Act
of Congress.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS filed a dissenting opinion, set
forth below, to the Court's order of November 20, 1972.
dissenting.
There are those who think that fashioning of rules of
evidence is a task for the legislature, not for the judiciary.
Wigmore thought the task was essentially a judicial
one, 1 J. Wigmore, Evidence 251 et seq. (3d ed.
1940); and I share that view, leaving the problem for
case-by-case development by the courts or by Congress.
But my concern with these Rules of Evidence is twofold. First, I doubt if rules of evidence are within the
purview of the statute under which we are authorized
to submit proposed Rules to Congress. The Act provides
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

*A further amendment to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 43 was prescribed
by the Court's order of December 18, 1972.

STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS, J.

that the Supreme Court shall have the power "to prescribe by general rules, the forms of process, writs, pleadings, and motions, and the practice and procedure of
the district courts and courts of appeals of the United
States in civil actions, including admiralty and maritime
cases, and appeals therein, and the practice and procedure in proceedings for the review by the courts of
appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United
States and for the judicial review or enforcement of
orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions,
and officers." 28 U. S. C. § 2072.
I can find no legislative history that rules of evidence
were to be included in "practice and procedure" as used
in § 2072. The Committee Reports on the original Act
throw no light on the question. H. R. Rep. No. 1829,
73d Cong., 2d Sess.; S. Rep. No. 1049, 73d Cong., 2d
Sess. The words "practice and procedure" in the setting
of the Act seem to me to exclude rules of evidence. They
seem to me to be words of art that describe pretrial
procedures, pleadings, and procedures for preserving objections and taking appeals.
Second, this Court does not write the Rules, nor supervise their writing, nor appraise them on their merits,
weighing the pros and cons. The Court concededly is a
mere conduit. Those who write the Rules are members
of a Committee named by the Judicial Conference. The
members are eminent; but they are the sole judges of
the. merits of the proposed Rules, our approval being
merely perfunctory. In other words, we are merely the
conduit to Congress. Yet the public assumes that our
imprimatur is on the Rules, as of course it is.
We are so far removed from the trial arena that we
have no special insight, no meaningful oversight to contribute. The Rules of Evidence-if there are to be
some-should be channeled through- the Judicial Conference whose members are much more qualified than we
to appraise their merits when applied in actual practice.
