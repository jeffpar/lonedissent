OCTOBER TERM, 1972
Opinion in Chambers

ET AL.

v.

409 U. S.

NELSON, ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF ARIZONA
ON

MOTION

No. A-412.

FOR

INJUNCTION

Decided October 20, 1972

The motion for injunction pending appeal of candidates who failed
to secure ballot placement for the November 7, 1972, election
in Arizona is denied because orderly election processes would
likely be disrupted by granting so tardy an application.

MR.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS,

Circuit Justice.

Petitioners are candidates of the American Independent
Party who complain of their inability to get on the ballot
in Arizona for the November 7, 1972, election.
They brought suit in the District Court but their complaint was dismissed. They desire to appeal to the Court
of Appeals but were denied a preliminary injunction by
a judge of that court. They now apply to me as Circuit
Justice.
The complaint may have merit. But the time element
is now short and the ponderous Arizona election machinery is already under way, printing the ballots. Absentee ballots have indeed already been sent out and
some have been returned. The costs of reprinting all
the ballots will be substantial and it may well be that
no decision on the merits can be reached by the Court
of Appeals in time to reprint the ballots excluding petitioners, should they lose on the merits.
I have been unable to hear oral argument and have
only the papers of the parties before me.
On the basis of these papers I have concluded that in
fairness to the parties I must deny the injunction, not
because the cause lacks merit but because orderly elec-

tion processes would likely be disrupted by so late an
action. The time element has plagued many of these
election cases; but one in my position cannot give relief
in a responsible way when the application is as tardy as
this one.
So I deny the injunction.
