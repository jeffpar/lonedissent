Per Curiam

STEWART v. MASSACHUSETTS
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT
OF MASSACHUSETTS

No. 71-5446.

Decided June 29, 1972

Imposition and carrying out of death penalty in this case held to
constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments. Furman v. Georgia, ante, p. 238.
Mass. -,
270 N. E. 2d 811, vacated and remanded.

PER CURIAM.

The appellant in this case was sentenced to death.
The imposition and carrying out of that death penalty
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of
the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Furman v.
Georgia, ante, p. 238. The motion for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis is granted. The judgment is therefore vacated insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death
penalty imposed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings.
