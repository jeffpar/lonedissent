MEMPHIS BANK & TRUST CO. v. GARNER, SHELBY
COUNTY TRUSTEE, ET AL.
APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF TENNESSEE
No. 81-1613.

Argued November 29, 1982-Decided January 24, 1983

A Tennessee statute imposes a tax on the net earnings of banks doing business in the State, and defines net earnings to include interest received on
obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities and of other
States but not interest earned on obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions. Appellant bank brought an action in a Tennessee state
court to recover taxes paid on interest earned on various federal obligations, alleging that the bank tax, as applied to appellant, violated 31
U. S. C. §742-which exempts obligations of the United States from
state and local taxation except where the taxes are "nondiscriminatory
franchise or other nonproperty taxes in lieu thereof imposed on corporations" or estate or inheritance taxeS-and thus was unconstitutional
under the Supremacy Clause. The trial court granted appellant's motion for a summary judgment. The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed, holding that the bank tax fell within the exception for "nondiscriminatory franchise taxes" set forth in § 742.
Held: The Tennessee bank tax violates the immunity of obligations of the
United States from state and local taxation. The tax cannot be characterized as nondiscriminatory under § 742. It discriminates in favor of
securities issued by Tennessee and its political subdivisions and against
federal obligations by including in the tax base income from federal obligations while excluding income from otherwise comparable state and
local obligations, and thus improperly discriminates against the Federal
Government and those with whom it deals. Pp. 395-399.
624 S. W. 2d 551, reversed and remanded.

delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Tennessee bank tax imposes a tax on the net earnings
of banks doing business within the State, and defines net
earnings to include income from obligations of the United
States and its instrumentalities but to exclude interest
earned on the obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-751 (Supp. 1982). This
appeal presents the question whether the Tennessee bank
tax violates the immunity of obligations of the United States
from state and local taxation.

JUSTICE MARSHALL

Appellant Memphis Bank & Trust Co. (Memphis Bank)
brought this action in state court to recover $56,696.81 in
taxes covering the years 1977 and 1978 which had been assessed pursuant to the Tennessee bank tax, Tenn. Code Ann.
§67-751 (Supp. 1982).1 Each bank doing business in Ten*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed by Solicitor General
Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General Hamblen, Stuart A. Smith, and

"'Excise tax on bank earnings-Rate.-There is hereby created a
subclassification of intangible personal property which shall be designated
as the 'shares of banks and banking associations.' All property in this
subclassification shall be taxed in the following manner: Commencing in
1977 and each year thereafter, in lieu of the assessment according to the
value and taxation of its intangible personal property, each bank doing
business in this state shall pay to local governments of Tennessee an excise
tax of three percent (3%) of the net earnings for the next preceding fiscal
year less ten percent (10%) of the ad valorem taxes paid by the bank on its
real property and tangible personal property for the next preceding year.
The net earnings shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed by
chapter 27 of title 67. The tax herein imposed shall be in lieu of all taxes

nessee is required under §67-751 to pay to local governments
of the State a tax of 3% of the bank's net earnings for the preceding fiscal year, less a portion of the ad valorem taxes paid
by the bank for that year.2 Under the statute, net earnings
include interest received by the bank on the obligations of the
United States and its instrumentalities, as well as interest on
bonds and other obligations of States other than Tennessee,
but exclude interest on obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions.!
Appellant alleged that the bank tax, as applied to it, violated 31 U. S. C. §742, and thus was unconstitutional under
the Supremacy Clause. The parties stipulated that the
amount of tax paid by appellant for the years 1977 and 1978
was based entirely on interest earned on various federal
stock, customer savings and checking accounts, certificates of deposit and
certificates of investment, by whatever name called, including other intangible corporate property of such bank or banking association provided that
such bank or banking association shall nonetheless continue to be subject to
ad valorem taxes on its real and tangible personal property, the excise tax
imposed under chapter 27 of title 67 and all other taxes to which it is currently subject."
'A "minimum tax" provides that under § 67-751 the bank shall be taxed
no less than an ad valorem tax calculated on 60% of the bank's book value.
Tenn. Code Ann. §67-752 (Supp. 1982). The parties apparently did not
consider the "minimum tax" described in § 67-752 to be an alternative basis
of tax liability in the event that § 67-751 was held unconstitutional. Accordingly, the courts below had no occasion to consider the constitutionality of §67-752 and we do not reach this question.
'For purposes of the bank tax, the term "net earnings" is defined as
"[flederal taxable income" with specified adjustments. Tenn. Code Ann.
§ 67-2704 (Supp. 1982). "Federal taxable income" includes interest on obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities, but does not include interest on state or municipal obligations. See 26 U. S. C. § 103(a).
Tennessee Code Ann. §67-2704(b)(1)(B) adjusts "federal taxable income"
by adding "[ilnterest income earned on bonds and other obligations of other
states or their political subdivisions, less allowable amortization." However, no similar adjustment is made to include interest on obligations of the
State of Tennessee or its political subdivisions in the definition of "net earnings" subject to the bank tax.

Opinion of the Court

obligations, primarily notes and bills of the United States
Treasury and obligations of Federal Credit Banks., They
also stipulated that if the interest earned on such federal
obligations were excluded from the computation, Memphis
Bank would owe no taxes for the years in question.
The Chancery Court of Shelby County granted Memphis
Bank's motion for summary judgment, holding that 31
U. S. C. § 742 prohibits the inclusion of interest on obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities in the
computation of taxable "net earnings" under the Tennessee
bank tax. The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed. 624
S. W. 2d 551 (1981). It held that the bank tax fell within the
exception for "nondiscriminatory franchise ... taxes" set
forth in 31 U. S. C. § 742. We noted probable jurisdiction,
456 U. S. 943 (1982), and we reverse.
II
Title 31 U. S. C. § 742 establishes a broad exemption of
federal obligations from state and local taxation:
"Except as otherwise provided by law, all stocks, bonds,
Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United
States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State
or municipal or local authority. This exemption extends
to every form of taxation that would require that either
the obligations or the interest thereon, or both, be considered, directly or indirectly, in the computation of the
tax, except nondiscriminatory franchise or other non'There are 37 Farm Credit Banks: 12 Federal Land Banks, 12 Federal
Intermediate Credit Banks, and 13 Banks for Cooperatives. They are federal instrumentalities designed to provide a reliable source of credit for agriculture. Pub. L. 92-181, 85 Stat. 583, 12 U. S. C. § 2001 et seq. See
generally United States v. Mississippi Chemical Corp., 405 U. S. 298,
301-305 (1972).
The tax on Memphis Bank was also based in part on income from obligations of the Farmers Home Administration and the Federal National Mortgage Association.

property taxes in lieu thereof imposed on corporations
and except estate taxes or inheritance taxes."
The exemption established in § 742 applies not only to Treasury notes and bills, but also to the obligations of such instrumentalities of the United States as Federal Farm Credit
Banks. Cf. Smith v. Davis, 323 U. S. 111, 117 (1944) ("other
obligations" must be interpreted "in accord with the long established Congressional intent to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United
States in an effort to secure necessary credit"). Because no
federal statutes have "otherwise provided," § 742 applies to
income from the types of federal obligations held by Memphis
Bank. 5 Therefore, the bank tax is impermissible unless the
tax is a "nondiscriminatory franchise or other nonproperty
ta[x] in lieu thereof" under §742.6
We have not previously had occasion to determine whether
a state or local tax is "nondiscriminatory" within the meaning
of § 742. However, we have frequently considered this concept in our decisions concerning the constitutional immunity
I In establishing the Federal Farm Credit Banks, Congress made clear
that the obligations of these banks would be immune from taxation by the
States. 12 U. S. C. §§ 2055, 2079, and 2134. We have no occasion to determine whether the immunity described in these provisions is broader
than that otherwise provided by 31 U. S. C. § 742. We note, however,
that for purposes of federal tax immunity, our cases have made no distinction between the obligations of the United States Treasury and the obligations of the Federal Credit Banks. See, e. g., Tradesmens National Bank
of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma Tax Comm'n, 309 U. S.560 (1940); Schuylkill
Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, 296 U. S.113 (1935); FederalLand Bank v.
Crosland,261 U. S.374 (1923); Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, 279 U. S.
620 (1929); Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., 255 U. S. 180 (1921).
'The nondiscrimination requirement applies to both franchise taxes and
other nonproperty taxes. Cf. S. Rep. No. 909, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 8
(1959). Because we hold that the Tennessee bank tax discriminates
against federal obligations, we need not reach the question whether the tax
may be characterized as a "franchise or other nonproperty ta[x] in lieu
thereof."

Opinion of the Court

of Federal Government property, including bonds and other
securities, from taxation by the States. Our decisions have
treated § 742 as principally a restatement of the constitutional rule. See, e. g., New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v.
Division of Tax Appeals, 338 U. S. 665, 672 (1950); Missouri
ex rel. Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, 281 U. S. 313, 321-322
(1930).
Under the constitutional rule cf tax immunity established
in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), "States
may not impose taxes directly on the Federal Government,
nor may they impose taxes the legal incidence of which
falls on the Federal Government." United States v. County
of Fresno, 429 U. S. 452, 459 (1977) (footnote omitted).
Where, as here, the economic but not the legal incidence of
the tax falls on the Federal Government, such a tax generally
does not violate the constitutional immunity if it does not discriminate against holders of federal property or those with
whom the Federal Government deals. See, e. g., United
States v. County of Fresno,supra, at 459-464; United States
v. City of Detroit, 355 U. S. 466, 473 (1958); Werner Machine
Co. v. Directorof Division of Taxation, 350 U. S. 492 (1956);
Tradesmens National Bank of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma Tax
Comm'n, 309 U. S. 560, 564 (1940).?
A state tax that imposes a greater burden on holders of
federal property than on holders of similar state property impermissibly discriminates against federal obligations. See,
e. g., United States v. County of Fresno, supra, at 462 ("a
state tax imposed on those who deal with the Federal Government" is unconstitutional if the tax "is imposed [un]equally on ... similarly situated constituents of the State").
Our cases establish, however, that if the "tax remains the
7
Although the scope of the Federal Government's constitutional tax immunity has been interpreted more narrowly in recent years, there has been
no departure from the principle that state taxes are constitutionally invalid
if they discriminate against the Government. See, e. g., United States v.
New Mexico, 455 U. S. 720, 735, n. 11 (1982).

same whatever the character of the [property] may be, no
claim can be sustained that this taxing statute discriminates
against the federal obligations." Werner Machine Co. v.
Director of Division of Taxation, supra, at 493-494. In
Schuylkill Trust Co. v. Pennsylvania, 296 U. S. 113, 119120 (1935), we held invalid a Pennsylvania tax levied upon the
shares of a trust company that was measured by the company's net assets. In calculating net assets, the statute excluded shares owned by the trust company in Pennsylvania
corporations but included shares owned in United States obligations. The Court found that the tax statute discriminated in favor of securities issued by Pennsylvania corporations and against United States bonds or other obligations.
Similarly, in Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent
School District, 361 U. S. 376 (1960), we held unconstitutional a local tax upon private lessees which was imposed on
the estimated full value of the leased premises. The tax
statute applied to lessees of United States Government property but not to lessees of exempt real property owned by the
State and its political subdivisions. We held that the tax
"discriminates unconstitutionally against the United States
and its lessee." Id., at 387.
It is clear that under the principles established in our previous cases, the Tennessee bank tax cannot be characterized
as nondiscriminatory under § 742. Tennessee discriminates
in favor of securities issued by Tennessee and its political
subdivisions and against federal obligations. The State does
so by including in the tax base income from federal obligations while excluding income from otherwise comparable
state and local obligations. 8 We conclude, therefore, that
'We cannot regard the impact of the discrimination as de minimi.
According to the United States, which filed a brief as amicue curiaein support of reversal, if all 50 States enacted provisions comparable to the Tennessee bank tax, the United States would incur additional annual borrowing costs estimated at $280 million at an interest rate of 12%. Brief for
United States as Amicu8 Curiae2.

Opinion of the Court

the Tennessee bank tax impermissibly discriminates against
the Federal Government and those with whom it deals.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
