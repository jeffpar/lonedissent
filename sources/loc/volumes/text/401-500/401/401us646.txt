WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOE
THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
No. 81.

Argued October 21,. 1970-Decided April 5, 1971*

In No. 81, here on direct review, petitioner was convicted of selling
narcotics after a trial in which heroin seized in a search incident
to his arrest was introduced into evidence. The Court of Appeah
affirmed, holding that the intervening decision in Chimel v. Cali
fornia, 395 U. S. 752; narrowing the scope of permissible searche
incident to arrest, was"not to be retroactively .applied to searche
antedating the date it was decided, and that the search was valiE
under pre-Chimel law. Evidence at the trial of petitioner in No.
82 included marked lills seized during a" 3ie-Chimel search of his
apartment following his "arrest on narcotics charges. The arrest
and search were upheld at trial, on direct appeal, and in the District Court and Court of Appeals in proceedings under 28 U. S. C.
§ 2255. Held: The judgments are affirmed. Pp. 649-666, 699700.
No. 81, 418 F. 2d 159, and No, 82, affirmed.
JUSTICE, MR. Jus-"
MR.JUSTICE W~rrE, joined by THE CHIEF
TIcE STEWART,

and MR.JUSTICE BLcicuzr, concluded that Chimel,

supra, is not retroactive"and should not be applied to searches conducted prior ta the date of that decision. Pp. 649-659.
(a) Where the major purpose of a new constitutional standard
is not to overcome an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially
impairs the truth-finding function and thus raises serious questions
about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new ruk
does not require retrospective application. P. 653.
(b) The Constitution does not require that pre-Chimel searches
be measured by the new Chimel standards, Desist v,United States,
394 U. S. 244.,. Petitioners' rights under then-existing law were
not violated either beforq or during trial, it is not claimed that tte
evidence was constitutionally insufficient to prove guilt, and the
purpose of the exclusionary rule will be sufficiently implemented
by applying Chimel to searches occurring after the date of decision in that case. P. 656.
*Together with No. 82, Elkanich v. United States, also on certiorari

(c) There is no constitutional difference between the applica,bility of Chimel to convictions here on direct appeal and those
involving collateral proceedings, or between federal and state
prisoners. Pp. 656-659.
MP. JUSTIcE BRENNAN concluded that 'the question is not
whether every person 'convicted through evidence obtained contrary to Chimel, supra, is guilty, but rather whether Chimel compels the conclusion that the invasion of petitioners' privacy, conducted in justifiable but mistaken reliance upon the continuing
validity of pre-Chimel standards, requires the exclusion of the fruits
of that invasion from the factfinding process. He agreed with the
plurality opinion that it does not, and that the Chimel rule should
not be applied retroactively. Pp. 660-665.
MR. JUSTiCF BLAcK concurred in the result on the ground that

thimel, supra, was wrongly decided. P. 660.
MR. JusTICE. HARLA
concluded that the judgment should be
affirmed in No. 82, here on collateral review, as the search in that
case should not be subjected to the requirements of Chimel, supra,
since petitioner's conviction became final prior to (himel, thenprevailing law validated the search, and the conviction was obtained
by methods not fundamentally unfair. Pp. 699-700.
Mn. JusTiCE MAnsHAL concluded that the judgment in No. 82
should be affirmed, as the mode of analysis in the plurality opinion
is appropriate in cases here on collateral review, and the Chimel
rule should not be applied retroactively.-in such cases. Pp. 665666.

Griswold, Assistant Attorney General Wilson, Mr. Beytagh, and Miss Rosenberg.
MR. JUSTICE W iTE announced the judgment of the
Court and an opinjon in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
MR. JUSTICE STEWXRT, and MR.'JUSTICE BLACKMUN join..

The principal question in these cases is whether Chimel
v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), should be applied
-retroactively either to the direct review of petitioner
Williams' conviction or in the collateral proceeding initiated by petitioner Elkanich.
I
In No. 81, federal agents on March 31, 1967, secured
a warrant to arrest petitioner Williams on charges of
selling narcotics in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 174. Williams was arrested at his home that night. A quantity
of heroin was discovered and seized in the course of a
search incident to the arrest. The trial court sustained
the search and the -heroin was introduced in evidence.
Williams was convicted and sentenced to a 10-year prison
tenrii. The judgment, of conviction was affirmed by the
Court- of Appeals for the Ninthf Circuit. Williams v.
"UnitedStates, 418 F. 2d 159 (CA9 1969). That court
held: (1) that our intervening decision in Chimel v.
California,supra, was not retroactive and did not govern
searches carried out prior toJune 23, 1969, the date. of
that decision; and (2) that the search was valid under
pre-Chimel law evidenced by United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), and Harris v. United States,
331 U. S.,,,15 (1947). The Court of Appeals also

Opinion of WfrrpE, J.

rejected a claim that the search was invalid because
the arrest was a mere pretext for an unwarranted search.
We granted certiorari. 397 U. S. 986 (1970).
In No. 82, petitioner Elkanich was convicted on three
counts of selling narcotics in violation of 21 U. S. C.
§ 174. He was sentenced to three concurrent 10-year

sentences. The evidence introduced included marked
bills given by federal agents to an intermediary to use
in purchasing narcotics. The bills were seized during
a search of petitioner's apartment following his arrest
there. The search was challenged at trial on the ground
that the arrest was invalid. Both the arrest and the
incident search were, upheld at trial and on direct appeal,
Elkanich v. United States, 327 F. 2d 417 (CA9 1964), as
well as by the District Court and the Court of Appeals
in subsequent proceedings' brought by petitioher under

petitioner's § 2255 application was pending in the Court.
of Appeals. 396 U. S. i057 (1970). We affirm the
judgments in both cases.
II
Aside from an insubstantial claim by Williams that
his arrest was invalid,' neither petitioner in this 'Court
suggests that his conviction was unconstitutionally ob"The Court of Appeals correctly rejected Williams' claim that
his arrest was a pretext to make an otherwise invalid search.
Williams v. United States, 418 F. 2d 159, 160-161 (CA9 1969). In
his petition for certiorari, Williams also argued that there was insufficient proof of his knowledge of 'and control over the heroin foun"
in the incidental search of his home, and thus that the Government
had failed to prove constructive possession.' This claim was neither
briefed nor argued by the parties, and we decline to disturb the
judgment of the Court of Appeals rejecting it. See 418 F. 2d, at
162-163.

tained; no evidence. and no procedures were employed
at or before trial that violated any then-governing constitutional norms. Concededly, the evidence seized
incident to the arrest of both petitioners was both properly seized and admitted under the Fourth Amendment
as construed and applied in Harris in 1947 and Rabinowifz in 1950. Both Harris and Rabinowitz, however,
were disapproved by Chimel. That case considerably
-narrowed the permissible scope of searches incident to
arrest, and petitioners argue that the searches carried out
in these cases, if judged by Chimel standards, were unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and the evidence
seized inadmissible at trial.2 However, we reaffirm our
2 Petitioner Williams was arrested pursuant to a warrant in the
living room of his residence shortly after midnight. Eight offiters
were involved, and the entire house was searched for a period of

was found in a container on a closet shelf in one of the bedrooms.
Williams, supra, n. 1, at 161. The Government does not argue fkt.
this search incident to arrest complies with Chimel. Elkanich was'arrested without a warrant in his apartment. He
does not argue that the arresting agents did, not have probable
cause to arrest but asserts that the search violated the Fourth
Amendment. Three agents came to petitioner's apartment, and,
.after the door was opened by his wife in response to a knock,
entered 'and immediately arrested petitioner. After handcuffing
Ellkanich, the agent in charge called for assistance: Three more
agents arrived within 15 minutes, and they searched the four-room
apartment for over an hour. The supervising agent asked petitioner
if he had any large sums of cash, guns, "or anything of that kind"
in the apartment. Petitioner at first said no, but later indicated
there was some money in a broom closet. The agent found $500
above the molding at the top of the closet, returned to the living
room, and searched petitioner and his wife, finding $200 on each
of them. Another agent- then found a second roll of bills above
the molding in the broom closet, this one totaling about $1,000.
Two other items later introduced in evidence were seized from a
closet in the living room. Of the total of nearly $2,000 seized,
$1,550 consisted of marked bills- used by an undercover agent to

to the decision in that case. Desist v. United States,
394 U. S. 244 (1969).
In Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618 (1965), we
declined to give complete retroactive effect to the exclusionary rule of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961).
Relying on prior cases, we firmly rejected the idea that
all new interpretations of the Constitution must be
considered, always to have been the law and that prior
constructions to the contrary must always be ignored.
Since that time, we have held to the course that there is
no inflexible constitutional rule requiring in all circumstances either absolute retroactivity, or complete prospectivity for decisions construing the broad language of the
Bill of Rights.3 Nor have we accepted as a dividing line
purchase narcotics from one Rios, whom petitioner was alleged to be
supplying.

The Government here argues that exigent circumstances justify
the search without a warrant. The argument is that the presence
of petitioner's wife in the apartment left. the agents only two
choices: (1) to postpone searching until a warrant could be secured,
a course Which would entail either some sort of control over, the
wife's activity or a risli that evidence would disappear; or (2) to
search the apartment immediately, as they did.
Because of our resolution of the retroactivity question, we find itunnecessary to pass on this contention.
3Many of the cases are discussed in the majority and dissenting
opinions in Desist v. United States, 394 U. S.244 (1969). These,
cases, and the general question of prospective effect for judicial,
decisions, have generated a 'substantial amount. of commentary.

Where the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that
substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so
raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete
retroactive effect.' Neither good-faith reliance by state
or federal authorities on prior constitutional law or
accepted practice, nor severe impact on the administration of justice has sufficed to require prospective appli-cation in these circunmstances.
It is quite different where the purpose of tle newconstitutional standard proscribing the use of certaini evi-,
dence or a particular mode of trial is not to minimize
or avoid arbitrary or unreliable results but to serve other
ends. In these situations the new' doctrine raises no
question about the guilt of defendants convicted, in prior
trials. Mapp v. Ohio cast no doubt Ofi the relevanceor probity of illegally seized evidence ,but excluded it

expanded Fourth Amendment protection against nonconsensual eavesdropping. It followed that evidence obtained by nontrespassory electronic surveillance of a
public telephone booth became subject to the exclusionary rule, which had been fashioned by the Court to
exact compliance with the Amendment rather than to
protect defendants, from conviction on uitrustworthy
evidence. Thus the Court, when it came. to consider
the retroactivity of Mapp and Katz, was dealing with
cases quite different from those situations where emerging constitutional 'doctrine casts such doubt upon th¢
soundness of some aspect of prior trials that State and
Federal Governments were disentitled from further ph1rsuing the goals of their criminal law against defendants
convicted in such prior trials:
The petitioners in both Linkletter and Desist were
convicted in proceedinigs that conformed to all thenapplicable constitutional norms. In both cases the government involved had a concededly guily defendant in
custody and substantial unsatisfied interests in achieving
with respect to such defendant whatever deterrent and
rehabilitative goals underlay its criminal justice system..
Each defendant, Linklette by the habeas corpus roite,
land Desist on direct app al, claimed 'the benefit of a
later decided case and demanded a new trial. But
ordering new trial would have involved not only expense and effort bht the inevitable risk of unavailable
witnesses and faulty memories; the authorities might
not have had the evidence they once had and might
have been 'foreclosed from obtaining other evidence they
might have secured had they known the evidence they
were using was constitutionally suspect. Moreover, it
was not essential to the deterrent purpose of the e~clusionary rule that Mapp and Katz be given retroactive

The Fourth Amendment cases do not stand alone: We have
reached similar results in holding nonretroactive new interpretations.
of the Fifth Amendment's' privilege against compelled self-incrimination, although some ramifications of the privilege, have' more
connection with trustorthy results than does the exclusionary,
rule designed to enforce the Fourth Amendment. See "Tehan v.

384 U. S. 719, 730 ,(1966); .Desist v. United States, 394 U. S., at
249-250, n.:14; cf. Mackey v.. United States, post, at 674-675. So,,
too, the right to jury trial secured by the Sixth Amendment "generally
tends to prevent arbitrariness and repression," DeStefano v. Woods,
392 U. S. 631, 633 (1968), and the holdings in United States v.
Wade, 388 U. S. 218 (1967), and Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S.
263 (1967), carry implications for the'xeliability of identification
testimony. But both Duncan v. Louisiana, 39-1 U. S. 145 (1968),
bbligating the States to recognize the right to jury trial by virtue
of the Fourteenth and Sixth*Amendments; and Wade and Gilbert
were applied only prospectively in view of the countervailing considerations that retroactivity would entail; DeStefano .v. Woods,
supra; Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S.1293 (1967).
In both Johnson and Stovall, we frankly acknowledged that "[t]he
extent to which a condemned practice infects the integrity of the
truth-determining process at trial is a 'question of probabilities:"
388 U. S., at 298. Where.we have been unable to conclude that the
use of .such a "condemned practice" in past'criminal trials presents substantial likelihood that the results" of a number of those
trials were factually incorrect, we have not accorded retroictive effect
to the decision condemning that practice. See e. g., DeStefano,
392 U. S., at 633-634 .(quoting Duncan): "'We would not assert,
however, that every criminal trial-or any- particular trial-held
before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be
as fairly treated by a judge as, he Would be by a jury."'
Our Brother EURLw criticizes these decisions, eating that he finds'
"inherently intractable the purported distinction between those.new
rules that are designed to improve the factfinding process and those
designed principally.to further other values." Post, at 695. . Earlier,

Considering that Desist represents the sound approach
to retroactivity claims in Fourth Amendment cases, we
are confident that we are not constitutionally bound
to apply the standards of Chimel to the cases brought
hre by Elkanich and Williams. Both petitioners were
duly convicted when judged- by the then-existing law;
the authorities -violated neither petitioner's rights either
before or at trial. No claim is made that the evidence'
against them was constitutionally insufficient to prove
their guilt. And the Chimel rule will receive sufficient
implementation by applying it to those cases involving
the admissibility of-evideiice seized-in searches occurring
after ChimeI was announced on June 23, 1969, and
carried out by authorities who through mistake or ignorance have violated the precepts of that decision.
IV
Both from the course of decision since Linkletter and
from what has been said in this opinion, it, should be
clear that we find no constitutional difference between
the applicability of Chimel to those prior convictions
that are here on direct appeal and those involving
collateral proceedings. Nor in constitutional terms is
there any difference between state and federal prisoners insofar as retroactive application to their cases is
concerned.

operating within the confines of a rule that seeks to determine, inter

factually improper results in cases, where it was employed is surely

the concept of ordered liberty." .See n. 8, infra.

Does the Constitution

compel us to apply Chimel retroactively and set aside
Williams' conviction when he was convicted on sound
evidence secured in conformity with the then-applicable
constitutional law as announced bsr this Court? As
we have said, we think not+-no more so than it compels applying the teachings of Chimel' in reviewing the
denial of Elkanich's Petition for collateral relief. Other
than considering it inherent in the process of judicial
review, MR. JusTICE HARLAw does not directly address the
question. Nor does he purport to explain how the purpose of the exclusionary rule fashioned by this Court as
is quickly . affirmed. Assume further that after X's conviction is
affirmed by the State's highest court, this Court holds that. a practice
employed in both the X and Y trials Tviolates the Constitution. Both
X and Y come before this'Court at the same time seeking to have
the new rule applied to their cases--X on -direct review and Y'by
way of collateral attack. .(Or, X and Y could be petitioners tried tor
wholly different offenses in different States or in different districts in
the federal system. X, tried in a crowded jurisdiction and having
appellate review in a busy judicial system, would be before this
Court on direct review, while Y, whose case arose before less congested courts, would most likely be here on collateral attack.)
I nder MR. JUSTIcE HmILA-N's approach, X automatically receives
the benefit of the new rule-because we are a court of law somehow
bound to decide all cases here on direct review in accordance with
the law as it exists when the case arrives for consideration. Although
we remain a court of law, Y may or may not receive the benefit of
the new rule, the result depending on whether the npw rule is designed
to correct a practice that has come, over time, to shock our Brother's
conscience. Under our approach today, the results as to X and Y
would be consistent, as they should be.
As a perceptive jurist has remarked:
"[W]hen a court is itself changing the law by an overruling decision, its determination of prospectivity or retroactivity should not
depend upon th&stage in the judicial process that a particular case
has reached when the change is made. Too many irrelevant considerations, including the common cold, bear upon the rate of progress
of a case through the judicial system." Schaefer, supra, n. 3, at 645.

Our cases have settled the proposition that the Fourth Amendment requires agents of the Government to obtain prior judicial
approval of all searches and seizures, see, e. g., Davis v. Mississippi,

394 U., S. 721, 728 (1969); Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347,
356-357 (1967); James v. Louisiana, 382 U. S. 36 (1965); Preston v.

to be justified as the necessary incident of a lawful arrest.
But in applying these principles to the circumstances in- volved in Chimel, we were compelled to overrule Harris
v.United States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947), and United States
v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950). Harris and Rabinowitz were founded on "little more than a subjective
view regarding the acceptability of certain sorts of police
conduct, and not on considerations relevant to Fourth
Amendment interests." Chimel, supra, at 764-765; see
United States v. Rabinowitz, supra,at 83 (Frankfurter, J.,
dissenting). By the time of Chimel, this view had long
since been rejected; but until that day, Harris and
Rabinowitz gurvived as direct authority for the proposition that a lawful arrest would somehow justify a warrantless search of the premises on which the arrest
was made, beyond the immediate reach of the person
arrested.2
Accordingly, we are presented in these cases with the
question whether Chimel should be applied to require
the exclusion at trial of evidence which is the fruit of
a search', carried out before our decision in Chimel, and
which would be lawful if measured by the standards of
Harris and Rabinowitz, but unlawful-under the rule of
Chimel. The Court today holds that the fruits of
searches n~ade prior to our 'decision in Chimel may be
used in criminal trials if the searches may be justified
at 357 n. 19 and cases cited; cf. Chambers y.Maroney, 399 U. S.42
(1970). And, in all events, "[t]he scope of [a] search must be
'strictly tied to and justified'by' the circumstances which rendered
its initiation permissible." Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 19, quoting
Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S.294, 310 (1967) (concurring opinion).
2 Long before Chimel, of course, we had made clear that Harris
and Rabinowitz were not themselves without limit. James v.
Louisiana, 382 U. S.36 (1965); Kremen v. United States, 353 U. S.
346 (1957); see Von Cleef v. New Jersey. 395 U. S.814 (1969);

under the standards of Harris and Rabinowitz as those
siandard had previously been applied. ,See, e. g., Von
Cleef v. New Jersey, 395 U. S. 814 (1969). I agree. Jn
Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S.- 293, 297 (1967), we said that
•"[t]he criteria guiding resolution'of [this] "question

--the extent bf the rliance by law
standards;'
enforcement'(b)authorities.on.Ihe'old"standards, and.
(c) the effect on the administration of justice of
a retroactive application of the new standards."
All three factors imply, that the rule of .Chimel should
be applied only to search'es carried out after Chimel was
decided.,
I

Like the Fifth Amendment's protection against compulsory self-incrimination, the warrant requirement of
the Fourth 'Amendment stakes out. boundaries beyond
which the government may not tread in forcing evidence
or information from its citizens. When coercion, impermissible under the Fifth Amendment, has actually
produced an involuntary statement, we have invariably
held that the fruits of that unconstitutional coercion may
not be used to prosecute the individual involved for
crime. E. g., Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173
(1952) (Frankfurter, J.) ; Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S.
143 (1944); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 630635, 638 (1886).-

Exclusion of statements impermissibly

coerced is not merely a device to deter government agents
from improper conduct in the future. Exclusion of
coerced testimony is part and parcel of the privilege
3 Under

sit circumstances the Fifth Amendment requires that

the individhu ltlorned be granted immunity from prosecution
for the matters revealed in his statements is a question not pertinent
-here. See Piccirillo v. New York, 400 U. S. 548, 561-573 (1971)
(BRENNAN,

J., dissenting).

WILLIAMS v. UNITED STATES
BRENNAN,

401 U. S.

against self-incrimination. Likewise, when a search impermissible under the Fourth Amendment results in the
seizure of evidence, exclusion of the fruits of that unconstitutional. invasion is required not merely-in hope of
deterring unconstitutional searches in the future,' but in
order to vindicate the right of privacy guaranteed by
the Fourth Amendment. See Boyd v. United States,
supra; Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 390-394,
398 (1914) :Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.643, 656, 660 (1961).
Exclusion of evidence in order to vindicate the "right
of privacy, however, does not improve the reliability
of the factfinding process at trial. See Desist v. United
States, 394"U. S. 244, 249-250 (1969),'and cases cited.
Accordingly, this fabctor does not require that the standards of Chimel be retroactively applied. Desistv. United
States, supra; Stovall v. Ddnno, 388 U. S., at 297-299.
II
The factor of reliance by law-enforcement officials on
Harris and Rabinowitz points in the same direction. As
we recognized in Chimel itself, Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has often followed a tortuous path. 395 U. S.,
at 755-762. So long as Harris and Rabinowitz were not
visibly overruled, we cannot be surprised that policemen
and those who offer them guidance may not have scrutinized their doctrinal underpinnin'gs for ,igns of erosion.
And the extent f reliance, it appears, has been considerable. The Government represents, and petitioners
do not seriously dispute, that a very substantial number
of searches have been carried out in reliaice upon thdse
cases. In many of these, there is no reason to doubt
that a warrant could and would, have been obtained if
the officials involved had been aware that a warrant would
be required. This factor as well, therefore, implies that
Chimel should have only prospective application.

"IIi
Finally, we must evaluate the probable impact ,of
ietroactive application on the- administration of justice.
Persons convicted through the rise of -eiidence inadmissible under Chimel have been found to haveiengaged in
conduct ,that the government involved may legitimately
punish, Chimel casts no doubt upon the propriety of
the government's interest in punishing those who have
engaged in such conduct., Accordingly, it may fairly be
assumed that retroactive application of its standards
would result in a. substantial number of retrials. Yet
Chimel likewise casts no do'bt upon the reliability of
the initial determination of guilt at the previous trial.
Moreover, the legitimate reliance of Jaw-enforcement offi-,cials on Harris and Rabinowitz, as already noted, may
well have led them to conduct a warrantless search
merely because the w~xrant requirement, although easily
satisfied, was 'understandably not understood. The consequence of this is that- retroactive application of the
standards applied in Chimel would impose a substantial
burden upon the federal and state judicial systens, while
serving neither to redress knowing violations of individual
privacy nor to protect a class of persons the government
has no legitimate interest in punishing.
IV
This is not to say, however, that petitioners are to be'
denied relief because they are probably guilty. "[T]here
is always in litigation a margin oferror, representing error
in factfinding." Speiser v; Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525
(-1958). The constitutional requirement thaf guilt in
criminal cases be proved beyond a reasonable doubt
serves to limit, but cannot eliminate, the 'number of
criminal defendants found guilty who are in fact innocent.
See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 370-372 (1970)* (con-

curring opinion). In the present cases, both petitioners
asserted their innocence by pleading not guilty and going
to trial; and petitioner in No. 81, whose case is here
on direct review, raised, in his petition for certiorari the
question whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support a finding of guilt. But this Court does
not sit to review such questions.' In denying retroactive.
application to the rule of Chimel, we neither do nor could
determine that every person convicted by the use of
evidence obtained contrary to that rule is in fact guilty
of the crime of which he was convicted. The question
we face is not the legitimacy or sincerity of petitionbrs'
claims of innocence, or indeed whether any such claims
are expressly made at all. It is, instead, whether Chimel
v. California compels us to conclude that the invasion
of petitioners' privacy, conducted in justifiable but mis,takenr reliance upon the continuing validity of Harris
and Rabinowitz, requires the exclusiopi of the fruits of
that invasion from the factfinding process at trial. I
agree with the Court that it does not,, and that the standards of Chimel should apply only to searches carried
out after June 23, 1969..
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL,

ing in' part.
After studying afresh the pattern of the Court's retroactivity decisions since Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S.
618 (1965), I conclude that a decision of this Court con.struing. the Constitution should be applied retroactively
to all cases involving criminal convictions not yet final
at the time our decision is rendered. Sound jurisprudential reasoning, so well articulated by MR. JUSTICE
HARLAN in his separate opinion covering the present
cases, post, p. 675, in my view requires .that cases still on
direct reView should receive full benefit of our supervening constitutional decisions. I am persuaded' that

OCTOBER TERM, 1970

401 U. S.

willingness to tolerate the inevitable costs and anomalies
of the Court's currdnt approach to retroactivity is incompatible with the judicial 'duty of principled review of
convictions not yet final..
I disagree somewhat with MR. JUsTIcE HARLAN as to
the proper approach to retroactivity for cases arising on
habeas corpus or other modes of collateral attack. In
such cases I believe it is best to employ the three-part
analysis that the plurality undertakes today in deciding
the retroactivity of the rule in Chimel v. California,395
U. S. 752 (1969). This mode of'analysis 'Was foreshadowed in Linkletter, where the question was whether
the rule of Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), should be
applied on collateral review. The meth6d commends
itself, once the point of finality after direct review is
passed, as a careful and appropriate way of adjudicating
the "procedural" rights of litigants in iew of the puiposes of a new decisional rule and the concerns of effective law enforcement. In particular, if- the purposes of
a new rule- implicate decisively the basic truth-determining function of the criminal trial, thenI I believe, the
rule should be given full retroactive application, for ,the
required constitutional proce dure itself would then stand
as a concrete embodiment of "the concept of ordered
liberty." Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325
(1937).

In light of the above, I concur in the Court's disposition of No. 82. That case is before us on collateral review. For cases in such a posture the mode of analysis
used by the plurality is appropriate, and I agree that the
Chirnel rule should not be applied retroactively to such
cases.

No. 81 A- hefore us on direct review. Since there is a
clear violation of Chimel oil the facts.i would reverse the
iudgment below, for I believe that the same constituilional rule should be applied to adjudicate the 'rights
of the petitioner in No. 81 as was applied in Chimel's case.
