Syllabus

RELFORD v. COMMANDANT, U.S. DISCIPLINARY
BARRACKS, FT. LEAVENWORTH
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 98.

Argued December 15-16, 1970-Decided February 24, 1971

Petitioner, then an Army corporal, was convicted in 1961 by a general court-martial for violating Articles 134 and, 120 of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice by kidnaping and raping, within the
bounds of a military reservation, two women-one, who was waiting for her serviceman brother who was visiting the base hospital;
the other, who was on her way from the home on the base where
she lived with her serviceman husband to the post exchange where
she worked. In this habeas corpus proceeding the Court granted
certiorari on the issue of the retroactivity and scope of O'Callahan
v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969), which held that a court-martial
had no jurisdiction to try a member of the armed forces charged
with attempted off-post rape of a civilian and related offenses since
such crimes were not "service connected." Held:
1. Though some of the factors are present here that the Court
relied on for its result in O'Callahan (the offenses were committed
in peacetime within this country's territory, did not relate to the
accused'"s military duties, were traditionally cognizable in civilian
courts (which were available to try them), and did not directly
flout military authority or violate military property), this case
significantly differs from O'Callahan in that the crimes there were
committed by a serviceman away from his base against a victim
who had no connection with the base, whereas here the crimes were
committed on the base against women properly there, one of whom
was returnng to her work on the base when the attack occurred.
Pp. 364-365.
2. An offense committed by a serviceman on a military post that
violates the-security of a person or of property there is service
connected and may be tried by a court-martial. 'Pp. 367-369.
3. The question of O'Callahan's retroactivity is not decided.
Pp. 369-370.
409 F. 2d 824, affirmed.
BLCAKMUN, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.

Opinion of the Court

401 U. S.

Judson W. Detrick, by appointment of the Court, 397

U. S. 1020, argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.
Solicitor General Griswold argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief were Assistant Attorney General Wilson, Deputy Solicitor General Springer,
Beatrice Rosenberg, and Roger A. Pauley.
MR. JUSTICE BLA
UN delivered the opinion of the
Court.
In O'Callahanv. Parker,395 U. S. 258, decided June 2,
1969, by a five-to-three vote, the Court held that a
court-martial may not try a member of our armed
forces charged with attempted rape of a civilian, with
housebreaking, and with assault with inteht to rape,
when the alleged offenses were committed off-post on
American territory, when the soldier was on leave, and
when the chargescould have been prosecuted in a civilian
court. What is necessary for a court-martial, the Court
said, is that the crime be "service connected." 395 U. S.,
at 272.
O'Callahan's military trial, of course, was without those
constitutional guarantees, including trial by jury, to
which he would have been entitled had he been prosecuted in a federal civilian court in the then Territory of
Hawaii where the alleged crimes were committed.
O'Callahan already has occasioned a substantial
amount of scholarly comment." Much of it characterizes the decision as a significant one because it is said
to depart from long-established, or at least long-accepted,

did the O'Callahandissent, 395 U. S., at 284, forecasts
a period of confusion for both the civil and the military
courts. Not surprisingly, much of the literature is concerned with the issue of O'Callahan's retrospectivity:
Some writers assert that the holding must be applied
retroactively.
Others predict that it will not be so
applied.' Naturally enough, O'Callahanhas had its refParker, 9 Washburn L. J. 193 (1970) ; Wurtzel, O'Callahanv. PRzker:

task here concerns only its, application.
Isiah Relford, in 1961., was a corporal on active duty
in the United States Army. He was stationed at Fort
Dix, New Jersey.
- On September 4, 1961, 'the visiting 14-year-old sister
of another serviceman, who was on leave from his Army
station at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and who came to
Fort Dix when his wife delivered a child at the base
hospital, was abducted at the point of a knife from an
automobile in the hospital's parking'lot as she waited for
her brother. The girl was raped by her abductor.
A few weeks liter, on October 21, the wife of an Air
Force man stationed at McGuire Air Force Base, adjacent
to Fort Dix, was driving from her home on the base to
the post exchange concession, also on the bae, where
she worked as a waitress. As the woman slowed her
automobile for a stop sign, a man gained entry to the
car from the passenger side and, with a knife at her.
throat, commanded the woman to drive on some distance
to a dirt road in the fort's training area. She was raped
there.
The- second victim, with her Assailant still in the
automobile, was able to make her predicament known
to-military police. The assailant was apprehended and
turned out to be Relford. He immediately admitted
con'sensual intercourse with the victim. The next morning, after a brief interrogation, he confessed to kidnapiig
and raping both women.
At the time of each incident Relford was in civilian
clothes.
It is .undisputed that these events all took place on
the military reservation consisting of Fort Dix and the
contiguous McGuire Air Force Base.

RELFORD v. U. S. DISCIPLINARY COMMANDANT

Opinion of the Court

Relford, in due course, was charged with raping and
kidnaping each of the women, in violation of Arts. 120
and, 134, respectively, of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice, 10 U. S. C. §§ 920 and 934.9 He was tried by a
general court-martial in December 1961 and was ,convicted on the four charges. Relford's sentence was the
forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to the
lowest enlisted grade, and death. The customary reference to the staff judge advocate was made and the
convening authority approved. U. C. M. J. Arts. 60-65,
10 U. S. C. §§ 860-865. Upon the review by the Army
Board of Review,"° required under the Code's Art. 66,
10 U. S. C. § 866, the conviction was sustained; the
sentence, however, was reduced to hard labor for 30
years, total forfeitures, and a dishonorable discharge.
The Court of Military Appeals denied a -petition for
review on September 24, 1963. United States v. Relford,

Rape is specified in Art. 120 (a):
Rape and carnal knowledge.
"(a) Any person subject to this chaptei Who cormmits an act of
3exual intercourse with a female not his wife, by force and without
her consent, is guilty of rape and shall be punished by death or such
other punishment as a court-martial may direct."
Kidnaping is not specifically mentioned in the Code. The charge
for that offense, therefore, was laid under Art. 134, the General
Article:
"§ 934. Art. 134. General article'.
"Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disQrders
and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the
armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit- upon the
armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons
subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of
by a general, -special, or summary court-martial, according to the
nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court."

"§ 920. Art. 120.

OCTOBER TERM, 1970
Opinion of the Court

401 U. S.

Relford's case thus became final more than five and
a half years prior to this Court's decision in O'Callahan
v., Parker.
In 1967, Reitord, being in custody in the United States
Disciplinary Barracks at Leavenworth, Kansas, filed his
application for a writ of habeas corpus with the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas. He
alleged inadequate representation by counsel in the military proceeding. Chief Judge Stanley found no merit
in the claim and denied the application. On appeal,
Relford repeated the inadequate-representation

claim

and, for the first time, raised questions as to the admissibility of his confession, as to a lineup procedure, and
as to the fairness of his military trial. The Tenth Circuit reviewed all these claims on the merits, but affirmed
the District Court's denial of relief. ReIford v. Commandant, 409 F. 2d 824 (1969)."
The Tenth Circuit's opinion was filed on April 23,
1969, several weeks prior to this Court's decision in
O'Callahanv. Parker. The issue as to the propriety of
trial by court-martial, perhaps understandably, was not
raised before Judge Stanley or on the appeal to the Tenth
Circuit; the issue, however, had been presented in O'Callahan's chronologically earlier appeal in his habeas proceeding. See United States ex rel. O'CaZtahanv. Parker,
390 F. 2d 360, 363-364 (CA3 1968).
II
This case, as did O'Catlahan,obviously falls within the
area of stress between the constitutional guarantees contained in the Constitution's Art. III, § 2, cl. 3, in the
Sixth Amendment, and possibly in the Fifth Amendment,
on the one hand, and, on the other, the power vested in
" We are advised by the parties that Relford was released on
parole on May 20, 1970.

RELFORD v. U. S. DISCIPLINARY COMMANDANT
355

363

Opinion of the Court

.the Congress, by the Constitution's Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, "To
make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the
land and naval Forces,". with its supportive Necessary
and Proper provision in cl. 18, and the Fifth Amendment's correlative exception for "cases arising in the
land or naval forces."
Relford argues that O'Callahan'srequirement that the
crime be "service connected" before a court-martial may
sit demands that the crime itself be military in nature,
that is, one involving a level of conduct required only
of servicemen and, because of the special needs of the
military, one demanding military disciplinary action.
He further states that the charges, against him-like
those against O'Callahan--do not involve a level of conduct required only of servicemen. He maintains that
occurrence of the crimes on a military reservation and
the military-dependent identity of one of his victims do
not substantially support the military's claim of a special
need to try him.
In further detail, it is stated that the "Court in O'.Callahan recognized that a court-martial. "remains to a significant degree a specialized part of the overall 'mechanism by which military discipline is preserved," 395
U. S., at 265; that military courts, of necessity, are not
impartial weighers of justice, but have as their primary
consideration the enforcement of the unique discipline
required of a fighting force; and that, as a consequence,
the court-martial must be limited to the "least possible
power adequate to the end proposed." United States
ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 23 (1955), citing
Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821).
It is then said that the level of conduct Relford is
alleged to have violated, that is, intercourse only with
consent, is the very same level required in the civilian
community and is not altered by considerations of military dependency; that his alleged crimes are no more

military than were O'Callahan's; that the ability of the
military to perform its mission remains the same whether
the crimes with which he was charged were committed
on base or off base; that any interest in the maintenance
of order on the base is adequately served by apprehension of the offender and trial in a civilian court; that
the on-post/off-post distinction has little meaning; that
it is the nature of the crime that is important; that the
crimes charged to Relford stand in contrast topurely military crimes such, as desertion, absence without leave,
missing movement, assaulting a superior commissioned
officer, and being drunk on duty, U. C. M. J. Arts. 85, 86,
87, 90, and 112, 10 U. S. C. §§ 885, 886, 887, 890, and 912;
and that only crimes of the latter type have "an immediate adverse impact upon the ability of the military to
perform its mission," and are "proper subjects for the
exercise of military jurisdiction."
- III
In evaluating the force of this argument, the facts of
O'Callahanand the precise holding in that case possess
particular significance. We repeat: O'Callahan was in
military service at the time and was stationed at a base
in American territory. His offenses, however, took place
off base in a civilian hotel while he was on leave and

MR. JUSTICE DoUGIAs, in speaking for the Court, said:

"In the present case petitioner was properly absent from his military base when he committed the
crimes with which he is charged. There was no connection-not even the remotest one-between his
military duties and the crimes in question. The
crimes were not committed on a military post or
enclave; nor was the peison whom he attacked performing any duties relating to the military. Moreover, Hawaii, the situs of the crime, is not an armed

camp under military control, as are some of our
far-flung outposts.
"Finally, we deal with peacetime offenses, not
with authority stemming from the war power. Civil
courts were open. The offenses were committed
within our territorial limits, not in the occupied
zone of a foreign country. The offenses did not involve any question of the flouting of military authority, the security of a military post, or the integrity
of military property." 395 U. S., at 273-2-74.
We stress seriatim what is 'thus emphasized in the
holding:
1. The serviceman's proper*absenice froin the base.
2. The crime's commission away from the base.
3. Its commission-at a place not under military control.
4. Its commission within our territorial limits and not
in an occupied zone of a foreign country.
5. Its commission in peacetime and its being unrelatedto authority stemming from the war power.
6. The absence of any connection between the defendant's military duties and the crime.'
7. The victim's 'not being engaged in the performance
of any duty relating to the military.
8. The presence and availability of a civilian court in
which the case can be prosecuted.
9. The absence of any flouting of military authority.
10. The absence of any threat to a military post.
11. The absence of any violation of military property.
One might add still another factor implicit in the
others:
12. The. offense's being among -those traditionally
prosecuted in civilian courts.
IV
This listing of factors upon which the Court relied for
its result in O'Callahan reveals, of course, that it chose

OCTOBER TERM, 1970

to take an ad hoc approach todases where trial by courtmartial is challenged. We therefore turn to those factors
in Relford's case that, as spelled out in O'Callahan's,
bear upon the court-martial issue.
It is at once apparent that elements 4, 6, 8, 11, and 12,
and perhaps 5 and 9, operate in Relford's favor as they
did in O'Callahan's: The offenses were committed within
the territorial limits of the United States; there was no
connection between Relford's military duties and the
crimes with which he was charged; courts in New Jersey
were open and available for the prosecution of Relford;
despite the Vietnam conflict we may assume for present
purposes that the offenses were committed in peacetime
and that they were unrelated to any problem of authority stemming from the war power; military authority,
directly at least, was not flouted; the integrity of military
property was not violated; and the crimes of rape and
kidnaping are traditionally cognizable in the civilian
courts.
Just as clearly, however, the other elements, present
and relied upon in O'Callahan's case, are not at hand in
Relford's case. These are elements 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10:
Relford was not absent from the base; the crimes were
committed on the military enclave; the second victim,
because of her duties at the post exchange and because
of the fact that her abduction and the attack upon her
took place as she was returning to the PX at the end of
a short and approved break in her work, was engaged in
the performance of a duty relating to the military; and
the security of two women properly on the post was
threatened and, indeed, their persons were violated.
There are still other significant aspects of the Relford
offenses: The first victim was the sister of a serviceman
who was then properly at the base. The second victim
was the wife of a serviceman stationed at the base; she
and her husband had quarters on the base and were living

there. Tangible property properly on the base, that is,
two automobiles, were forcefully and unlawfully entered.
V
With the foregoing contrasting comparison of the pertinent factual elements of ,O'Cdllahan with those of Relford's case, we readily conclude that the crimes- with
which Relford was charged were triable by a military
court. We do not agree with petitioner when he claims
that the "apparent distinctions" between this cdse and
O'Callahan "evaporate when viewed within the context
of the 'service-connected' test." 12 We stress: (a) The
essential and obvious interest of the military in the
security of persons and of property on the military
enclave. Relford concedes the existence of this vital
interest.13 (b) The responsibility of the military commander for maintenance of order in his command and
his authority tomaifitain that order. See Cafeteria &
Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886
(1961). Relford also concedes this. (c) -The impact
and adverse effect that a crime committed against a
person or property on a military base, thus violating the
base's very security, has upon morale, discipline, reputation and integrity of the base itself, upon its personnel
and upon the military operation and the military mission.
(d) The conviction that Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, vesting in the
Congress the power "To make Rules for the Government
and Regulation of the land and naval Forces," means, in
appropriate areas beyond the purely military offense,
more than the mere power to arrest a serviceman offender
and turn him over to the civil authorities. The term
"Regulation" itself implies, for those appropriate cases,
the power to try and to punish. (e) The distinct possi12

bility that civil courts, particularly nonfederal courts, will
have less than complete interest, concern, and capacity
for all the cases that vindicate the military's disciplinary
authority within its.own community. See W. Winthrop,
Military Law and Precedents 725 (2d ed. 1896, 1920 Reprint); Wilkinson, The Narrowing Scope of Court-Martial Jurisdiction: O'Callahan v. Parker, 9 Washburn L. J.
193, 208 (1970). (f) The very positive implication in
O'Callahanitself, arising from its emphasis on the absence
of service-connected elements there, that the presence of
factors such as geographical and military relationships
have important contrary significance. (g) The recognition in O'Callahanthat, historically, a crime against the
person of one associated with the post was subject even
to the General Article. The comment from Winthrop,
supra, at 724:
"Thus such crimes as theft from or robbery of an
officer, soldier, post trader, or camp-follower...
inasmuch as they directly affect military relations
and prejudice military discipline, may properly beas they frequently have been-the subject of charges
under the present Article. On the other hand, where
such crimes are committed upon or against civilians,
and not at or near a military camp or post, or in
breach or violation of a military duty or order, they
are not in general to be regarded as within the description of the Article, but are to be treated as civil
rather than military offenses." (Footnotes omitted.)
cited both by the Court in O'Callahan, 395 U. S., at
274 n. 19, and'by the dissent at 278-279, certainly so indicates and even goes so far as to include an offense against
a civilian committed "near" a military post. (h) The
misreading and undue restriction of O'Callahanif it weje
interpreted as confining the court-martial to the purely
military offenses that have no counterpart in nonmilitary

RELFORD v.U. S. DISCIPLINARY COMMANDANT

Opinion of the Court

criminal law. (i) Our inability appropriately and meaningfully to draw any line between a post's strictly military areas and its nonmilitary areas, or between a serviceman-defendant's on-duty and off-duty activities and
hours on the post.
This leads us to hold, and we do so hold, that when-a
serviceman is charged with an offense committed within
or at the geographical boundary of a military post and
violative of the security of a person or of property there,
that offense may be tried by a court-martial. Exlressin'g
it another way: a serviceman's 'crime against the person
of an individual upon the. base or against property on
the base is "service connected," within the meaning of
that requirement as specified in O'Callahan,395 U. S., at
272. This delineation, we feel, fully comports with the
standard of "the least possible power adequate to the end
proposed" referred to in O'Callahan, 395 U. S., at 265.
By this measure, Relford's alleged offenses were obvi-"
ously service connected. There is, therefore, no constitutional or statutory I rier and Relford was properly
tried by a court-martial.
VI
We recognize that any ad hoc approach leaves outer
boundaries undetermined. O'Callahan marks an area,
perhaps not the limit, for the concern of the civil courts
and where the military may not enter. The case today
marks an area, perhaps not the limit, where the courtmartial is appropriate and permissible. - What lies between is for decision at another time.
Vii
Having reached this result on the court-martial issue,
the additional issue that the parties have argued, of
O'Callahan's retrospectivity, need not be decided. See
Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325

OCTOBER TERM, 1970

U. S. 450, 461 (1945). We recognize that the retroactivity question has important dimensions, both direct
and collateral, and that the Government strongly urges
that the question be decided here and now. We have
concluded, however, that the issue is better resolved in
other litigation where, .perhaps, it would be solely dispositive of the -case. We take some comfort in the hope
that the present decision should eliminate at least some
of the confusion that the parties and commentators say
has emerged from O'Callahan.4
