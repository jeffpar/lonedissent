OPINIONS OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES IN CHAMBERS

GREGG v. GEORGIA
ON

APPLICATION FOR STAY OF MANDATE

No. A-31 (74-6257).

Decided July 22, 1976*

Application for stay of mandate is granted pending disposition of a petition
for rehearing, since, if executions were carried out before that petition
could be acted on, petitioners would be irreparably harmed and cases
would be moot, and since granting of stay will not prejudice respondent
States' interests.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, Circuit Justice.

The petitioners in these cases have filed with the Court a
consolidated petition for rehearing, and also have presented
to me as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit an application
for a stay of the mandate heretofore scheduled to issue on
July 27, the stay to be effective pending the disposition of the
consolidated petition for rehearing. Under controlling statutes, such petition cannot be acted upon except by the full
Court in regular or special session. If the executions in these
cases were carried out before the petition for rehearing could
be acted on by the Court, the harm to petitioners obviously
would be irreparable. In addition, the cases would then be
moot. Nor is there reason to believe that the granting of a
stay until the petition for rehearing can be duly considered
will prejudice the interests of the respondent States. In these
circumstances, I conclude that the issuance of the mandate in
each of these cases should be, and hereby is, stayed until
further order of this Court.
The decision to grant this stay is not suggestive of my position on the merits of the petition.
