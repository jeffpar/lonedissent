Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336, distinguished.

MR. JUSTICE RHNQUIST,

Circuit Justice.

Applicant seeks a stay of an order of the District Court
for the Northern District of California remanding this case
to the California state-court system. Because I believe, for
the reasons outlined below, that the order of the District
Court is not subject to review, the application will be denied.
This state-law antitrust action was originally brought by
Charlene Rosack in the California Superior Court for San
Mateo County seeking damages individually and on behalf
of a class of persons who purchased new Volvo automobiles
from California Volvo dealers during the years 1967-1976.
Defendants removed the action to the Federal District Court
pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1441 (a), alleging that the action
was within the original diversity jurisdiction of this court
as prescribed in 28 U. S. C. § 1332. Plaintiff moved to remand the action to the state court on .theground, inter alia,
that the amount in controversy did not exceed $10,000 as
required by § 1332. The District Court granted the motion.
Its action was premised on the belief that the case "must
be treated as a class action for the purpose of determining
jurisdictional issues," whereas here "it appears that only a
few members of a class estimated to have some 50,000 mem-

bers meet the jurisdictional requirement." The District
Court accordingly held:
"It thus appears to a legal certainty that this Court
does not have jurisdiction of this action. It is a class
action brought on behalf of a class of plaintiffs the vast
majority of which do not satisfy the amount in controversy requirement with respect to their separate and
distinct claims. Under Zahn [v. International Paper
Co., 414 U. S. 291 (1973)], all of those plaintiffs would
have to be dismissed and, if feasible, a class substantially different from that on whose behalf the action
was brought certified. Accordingly, since the action
could not be maintained in this Court on behalf of the
class for which it was brought, it must be remanded.
28 U. S. C. § 1447 (c)." 1
Applicant attacks this conclusion, contending that since
the District Court specifically found that jurisdiction existed
over "a few members of" the class, the court's order remanding the entire action was not authorized by 28 U. S. C.
§ 1447 (c). The flaw in this argument is that, while the
District Court may have been wrong in its analysis, it clearly
stated, citing to § 1447 (e), that it considered itself without
jurisdiction. The District Court therefore thought it was
acting in accordance with § 1447 (c), which allows a remand
where an action is "removed improvidently and without jurisdiction." Review of this order, therefore, is presumptively
barred by the operation of 28 U. S. C. § 1447 (d):
"Aiu order remanding a case to the State court from
which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or
otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the
State court from which it was removed pursuant to
section 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal
or otherwise."

The Ninth Circuit denied the petition for a writ of mandamus and/or
prohibition on November 11, 1976.

Opinion in Chambers

We held last Term in Thermtron Products,Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U. S. 336 (1976), where the District Court ordered a remand because of its crowded dbcket, that § 1447
(d) did not bar review of remand orders "issued on grounds
not authorized by § 1447 (c)," 423 U. S., at 343V But the
District Court here did base its order on § 1447 (c). Thermtron is of no help to applicant as the remand was explicitly
based on an allegedly erroneous finding that the court "does
not have jurisdiction of this action," see 423 U. S., at 343-344.
Applicant's position would mean that any allegedly erroneous
application of § 1447 (c) would be reviewable by writ of mandamus, leaving the § 1447 (d) bar extant only in the case
of allegedly proper applications of § 1447 (c), a reading too
Pickwickian to be accepted, and contrary to the clear language of Thermtron3
Since I do not believe four Members of this Court would
find the order of the District Court subject to review, the
application for a stay is denied.

2 In Thermtron, the District Court acknowledged that the defendant
had a "right" to remove the action, pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1441, but
that this right had to be "'balanced against the plaintiffs' right to a forum
of their choice and their right to a speedy decision on the merits of their

cause of action.'" 423 U. S., at 340. As we noted, that order "was
based on grounds wholly different from, those upon which § 1447 (c) permits remand." Id., at 344.
3 "It is unquestioned in this case and conceded by petitioners that this
section prohibits review of all remand orders issued pursuant to § 1447 (c)
whether erroneous or not ....
If a trial judge purports to remand a case
on the ground that it was removed 'improvidently and without jurisdiction,' his order is not subject to challenge in the court of appeals by
appeal, by mandamus, or otherwise." 423 U. S., at 343 (emphasis added).
