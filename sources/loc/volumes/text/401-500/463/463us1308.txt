JULIAN v. UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR BAIL
No. A-1071.

Decided July 13, 1983

An application for bail pending disposition of applicant's petition for certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' judgment-which affirmed his
conviction and sentences for attempted importation of narcotics, making
false statements to a Government official, in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§ 1001, and failing to file a report in connection with the transportation of
more than $5,000 outside the United States, in violation of 31 U. S. C.
§ 1101-is denied. None of the contentions raised by applicant, including issues relating to statutory construction and double jeopardy principles, is likely to command the vote of four Justices to grant certiorari.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.

Applicant has filed a motion for bail pending disposition of
his petition for writ of certiorari. He was arrested in Los
Angeles on May 7, 1980, while attempting to board a nonstop
flight to Lima, Peru. Prior to the scheduled departure time,
a customs official had announced that anyone taking more
than $5,000 currency out of the country was required to ifie
a report with the Customs Service. When stopped on the
boarding ramp, applicant acknowledged that he had heard
the announcement but denied that he was carrying more than
$5,000. He repeated this denial during subsequent questioning, but a search of his person and belongings revealed approximately $29,000 in cash as well as a variety of narcotics
paraphernalia.
Following a jury trial in the United States District Court
for the Central District of California, applicant was convicted
of attempted importation of narcotics; making false statements to a Government official, in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§ 1001; and falling to ifie a report in connection with the transportation of more than $5,000 outside the United States, in
violation of 84 Stat. 1122, 31 U. S. C. § 1101. He was sentenced to concurrent 5-year terms and fined $5,000 each on

the first two counts. He received a consecutive 1-year term
and a $5,000 fine on the third count.
Applicant was freed on bond pending appeal. The Court
of Appeals, by a divided vote, affirmed his conviction in all
respects, and this application followed. For the reasons
explained below, the application is denied.
The standards to be applied are well established. Applica*tions for bail to this Court are granted only in extraordinary
circumstances, especially where, as here, "the lower court
refused to stay its order pending appeal." Graves v. Barnes,
405 U. S. 1201, 1203 (1972) (POWELL, J., in chambers). At a
minimum, a bail applicant must demonstrate a reasonable
probability that four Justices are likely to vote to grant certiorari. Bateman v. Arizona, 429 U. S. 1302, 1305 (1976)
(REHNQUIST, J., in chambers).
Applicant raises a number of contentions in his petition,
none of which, I believe, is likely to command the vote of
four Justices. First, he argues that 18 U. S. C. § 1001 does
not apply to his statements at all because those statements
were oral, unsworn, exculpatory, and immaterial. A fair
reading of the statute, however, brings applicant's false
statements to the customs official squarely within the prohibition of § 1001.* Second, applicant contends that a conviction under both 18 U. S. C. § 1001 and 31 U. S. C. § 1101
violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. But under the principle of statutory construction established in Blockburger v.
United States, 284 U. S. 299, 304 (1932), cumulative punishments under separate statutes are permitted provided only
that each statute requires proof of a fact not required by the
*Title 18 U. S. C. §1001 provides in relevant part:
"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or
agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or
covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any
false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations,... shall be
fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or
both."

other. Title 18 U. S. C. § 1001 requires a finding that applicant misled a Government official by material false statements. Title 31 U. S. C. § 1101 requires a different finding
that applicant failed to file the required currency reporting
form. Thus, the Blockburger test is satisfied, and afortiori
there is no double jeopardy.
Applicant also claims that the evidence taken from his person and his luggage was the fruit of unconstitutional searches
and should have been suppressed. But see United States v.
Ramsey, 431 U. S. 606, 616-619 (1977) (border searches
require neither probable cause nor a warrant). Applicant's
remaining contentions are even less substantial.
For these reasons, the application is
Denied.
