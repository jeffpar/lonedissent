KRAUSE FT AL. v. RHODES, GOVERNOR OF
OHIO, ET AL.
ON APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION AND/OR STAY

No. A-260.

Decided September 16, 1977

Application for an injunction and/or stay of Court of Appeals' mandate,
pending the filing of a petition for certiorari, for the purpose of stopping the construction of a gymnasium at Rent State University, is
denied, where similar applications are pending in the District Court
and Court of Appeals, both of which are in a position far superior to
that of an individual Justice fairly to assess the merits of applicants'
position.
See: 570 F 2d 563.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART,

Circuit Justice.

This is an application for an injunction and/or a stay of
mandate of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit, pending the filing of a petition for certiorari in this
Court. Its purpose is to secure from me, as Sixth Circuit
Justice, an order stopping for the time being the construction
of a gymnasium on a site at Kent State University in Ohio.
The claim is that only such an order will prevent the obliteration of evidence necessary to a fair retrial of a lawsuit in which
the applicants are plaintiffs.
Similar applications are now pending in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Because
of the intimate familiarity with the factual environment of
this litigation acquired by those courts during the original
trial and appeal, they are both now in a position far superior
to that of an individual Justice of this Court fairly to assess
the merits of the applicants' position.
Accordingly, the application is hereby denied, without

Appeals, or to petition this Court for certiorari.
