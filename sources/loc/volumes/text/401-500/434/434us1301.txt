CALIFANO, SECRETARY OF HEALTH, EDUCATION,

AND WELFARE v. McRAE

ET AL.

ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

No. A-46.

Decided July 20, 1977

In view of this Court's Rule 58 permitting a petition for rehearing to be
granted only by a Justice who concurred m the initial judgment or

decision,

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL

abstains from acting on an application

for stay, pending a petition for rehearing, of the Court's order vacating
the District Court's judgment and remanding for further consideration
in light of Maher v Roe, 432 U. S. 464, and Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S. 438,
since he dissented in both of those cases.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, Circuit Justice.

Section 209 of Pub. L. 94-439, 90 Stat. 1434, generally prohibits the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from
expending federal Medicaid funds for abortions. In the
instant case, the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York enjoined operation of the law On
June 29, 1977, this Court entered the following order"The judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to
the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of New York for further consideration in light of Maher v
Roe, 432 U S. 464 (1977), and Beal v Doe, 432 U S.
438 (1977) " See 433 U S. 916.
This is an application for
"a stay of execution of this Court's vacatur of the district
court's injunction of Section 209 of Public Law 94-439
(the 'Hyde Amendment') and/or, in the alternative for a
stay as follows:

OCTOBER TERM, 1977
Opinion in Chambers

434 U. S.

"1. A stay, pending conclusion of the district court's
reconsideration of this case in light of Maher v Roe, 432
U S. 464 (1977), and Beal v Doe, 432 U S. 438 (1977),
as ordered by this Court on [June] 29, 1977 in this case.
A stay is necessary to prevent irreparable harm during the
remand proceedings in the district court and to assure full
and effective presentation to and consideration by the
district court of the issues left open by this Court's
remand order, and/or in the alternative,
"2. A stay, pending the timely filing and disposition in
this Court of a petition for rehearing pursuant to Rule
59 (2) of this Court."
It is obvious that in essence applicants seek to have this
Court reconsider its order vacating the District Court's judgment, and seek an injunction to protect them during the consideration of a petition for rehearing. It is also clear that
the controlling legal precedents bearing on whether to grant
rehearing are Maher v Roe, 432 U S. 464: (1977), and Beal v
I dissented in both of those cases.
Doe, 432 U S. 438 (1977)
This Court's Rule 58 governing rehearings provides: "A petiwill not be granted, except at the
tion for rehearing
instance of a justce who concurredm the judgment or decision
and with the concurrence of a majority of the court." (Emphasis added.) For that reason I have decided to abstain on
this application and suggest that the application be made to
one of the Justices "who concurred in the judgment or decision" in Maher and Beal.
