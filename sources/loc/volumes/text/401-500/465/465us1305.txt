CLAIBORNE v. UNITED STATES

1305

Opinion in Chambers

CLAIBORNE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE v.
UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY
No. A-725.

Decided March 12, 1984

An application by a Federal District Judge to stay federal criminal proceedings against him is denied, since four Justices of this Court probably
would not vote to grant certiorari to review, at this stage of the litigation, the Court of Appeals' rejection of applicant's claims that a sitting
federal judge may not be criminally prosecuted before being removed
from office by impeachment, and that the prosecution against him was
"vindictive" or "selective."

Circuit Justice
Harry Eugene Claiborne, the applicant, is a sitting United
States Judge in the District Court for the District of Nevada.
In December 1983, he was indicted for violations of 18
U. S. C. ยง 201(c) and 18 U. S. C. ยง 1343. His contentions
that a sitting federal judge may not be criminally prosecuted
before being removed from office by impeachment, and that
the Government prosecuted him in order to punish him
for decisions made as a federal judge, were rejected by the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. He requests that
I stay the criminal proceedings against him, scheduled to
commence today, in order that this Court may review these
determinations.
The first contention-that a federal judge may not be indicted and tried for a criminal offense until he is first impeached and convicted by Congress-has been rejected not
only by the Court of Appeals in this case but also by the only
two other Courts of Appeals to consider the question.
United States v. Hastings, 681 F. 2d 706 (CA5 1982); United
States v. Isaacs, 493 F. 2d 1124 (CA7 1974). This Court
denied certiorari in both Hastings, 459 U. S. 1203 (1983), and
Isaacs, 417 U. S. 976 (1974).
JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion in Chambers

465 U. S.

Applicant's second claim appears to be a species of "vindictive" or "selective" prosecution, and the fact that he is a sitting federal judge does not seem to me to remove the claim
from the principles most recently discussed in United States
v. Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U. S. 263 (1982). I think
the Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that the denial of relief on this claim by the District Court was not immediately appealable under the "collateral order" doctrine.
Applicant finally contends that because the first of his
claims was appealable under the collateral-order doctrine,
the District Court lost jurisdiction to determine other pretrial matters pending resolution of the appeal by the Court of
Appeals. The Court of Appeals applied the dual-jurisdiction
approach set forth in United States v. Dunbar, 611 F. 2d 985
(CA5), cert. denied, 447 U. S. 926 (1980), and rejected this
claim.
I do not believe that four Justices of this Court would vote
to grant certiorari to review any one of these claims at the
present stage of this litigation, and I therefore deny the
application.
