CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. DARRONE,
ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE
OF LESTRANGE
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE THIRD CIRCUIT
No. 82-862.

Argued November 29, 1983-Decided February 28, 1984

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provides that "[n]o... handicapped individual ... shall, solely by reason of his handicap,. . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance." Section 505(a)(2), which was added to the Act in
1978, makes "available" the "remedies, procedures, and rights" set forth
in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) for suits under § 504
against "any recipient of Federal assistance." Petitioner was formed
under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act to acquire and operate insolvent railroads, and, as authorized by statute, has sold its securities to
the United States, the proceeds of which sales are permitted to be used
for maintenance of rail properties, capital needs, refinancing of indebtedness, or working capital. Petitioner also received federal funds to provide for reassignment and retraining of railroad workers whose jobs
were affected by the reorganization, and now receives federal funds to
provide termination allowances to workers who lost their jobs as a result
of the reorganization. Respondent's decedent filed suit in Federal District Court against petitioner for violation of his rights under § 504, alleging that while employed as a locomotive engineer by a railroad to which
petitioner is the successor in interest, he suffered an accident requiring
amputation of his left hand and forearm, and that thereafter the railroad
and the petitioner refused to employ him. The District Court granted
petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the decedent had no "standing" to bring a private action under § 504. The court
held that § 505(a)(2) had incorporated the limitation in § 604 of Title VI,
which provides that employment discrimination is actionable only when
the employer receives federal financial assistance the "primary objective" of which is to provide employment, and that the federal assistance
to petitioner did not satisfy this "primary objective" test. The Court of
Appeals reversed.
Held:
1. The death of respondent's decedent did not moot the case, since it
is clear that § 504 authorizes a plaintiff who alleges intentional discrimination (as was done here) to bring an equitable action for backpay.

2. The suit may be maintained even if petitioner receives no federal aid
the primary objective of which is to promote employment. Pp. 631-637.
(a) Section 504's language suggests that its bar on employment
discrimination should not be limited to programs that receive such federal aid. The legislative history, executive interpretation, and the Rehabilitation Act's purpose to promote and expand employment opportunities for the handicapped all are consistent with this construction.

(b) Nor did Congress intend to enact the "primary objective" requirement of § 604 of Title VI into the Rehabilitation Act when it added
§505(a)(2) to the Act in 1978. Section 505(a)(2)'s language does not incorporate § 604's "primary objective" limitation. Rather, the legislative
history reveals that §505(a)(2) was intended to codify regulations governing enforcement of §504 that prohibited employment discrimination
regardless of the purpose of federal financial assistance. P. 635.

OCTOBER TERM, 1983
Opinion of the Court

465 U. S.

JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case requires us to clarify the scope of the private
right of action to enforce § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, 87 Stat. 394, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 794 (1982 ed.),
that prohibits discrimination against the handicapped by federal grant recipients. There is a conflict among the Circuits.
I
The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 establishes a comprehensive
federal program aimed at improving the lot of the handicapped. Among its purposes, as originally stated, were to
"promote and expand employment opportunities in the public
and private sectors for handicapped individuals and to place
such individuals in employment." 29 U. S. C. § 701(8). To
further these purposes, Congress enacted §504 of the Act.
That section provides:
"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual . . .
shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from
the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance."
The language of the section is virtually identical to that of
§ 601 of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 252,
42 U. S. C. §2000d, that similarly bars discrimination (on the
ground of race, color, or national origin) in federally assisted
programs.
In 1978, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to specify the means of enforcing its ban on discrimination. In particular, § 505(a)(2), as added, 92 Stat. 2982, 29 U. S. C.
§794a(a)(2) (1982 ed.), made available the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Acts
of 1964" to victims of discrimination in violation of § 504 of the
Act.1
' Section 505(a)(2), as set forth in 29 U. S. C. § 794a(a)(2) (1982 ed.), provides in full: "The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title VI of

Opinion of the Court

Petitioner, Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), was
formed pursuant to Subchapter III of the Regional Rail
Reorganization Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 1004, 45 U. S. C. § 701
et seq. The Act, passed in response to the insolvency of a
number of railroads in the Northeast and Midwest, established Conrail to acquire and operate the rail properties of
the insolvent railroads and to integrate these properties into
an efficient national rail transportation system. Under § 216
of the Act, 90 Stat. 89, as amended, 45 U. S. C. § 726 (1976
ed. and Supp. V), the United States, acting through the United
States Railway Association, purchases debentures and series
A preferred stock of the corporation "at such times and in
such amounts as may be required and requested by the Corporation," but "in accordance with the terms and conditions
...prescribed by the Association. . . ." § 726(b)(1). The
statute permits the proceeds from these sales to be devoted
to maintenance of rail properties, capital needs, refinancing of
indebtedness, or working capital. Ibid. Under this statutory authorization, Conrail has sold the United States $3.28
billion in securities. See App. A-15.
Conrail also received federal funds under Subchapter V of
the Act, now repealed, to provide for reassignment and retraining of railroad workers whose jobs were affected by the
reorganization. And Conrail now receives federal funds
under § 1143(a) of the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981, 95
Stat. 662, 45 U. S. C. § 797a (1976 ed., Supp. V), that provides termination allowances of up to $25,000 to workers who
lose their jobs as a result of reorganization.
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be available to any person aggrieved by
any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance or Federal
provider of such assistance under section 794 of this title."
Section 505(a)(1) generally makes available the remedies of Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act to persons aggrieved by violation of §501 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which governs the Federal Government's employment
of the handicapped.

II
In 1979, Thomas LeStrange filed suit against petitioner for
violation of rights conferred by §504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. 2 The complaint alleged that the Erie Lackawanna
Railroad, to which Conrail is the successor in interest, had
employed the plaintiff as a locomotive engineer; that an accident had required amputation of plaintiff's left hand and forearm in 1971; and that, after LeStrange was disabled, the Erie
Lackawanna Railroad, and then Conrail, had refused to employ him although it had no justification for finding him unfit
to work.
The District Court, following the decision of Trageser v.
Libbie RehabilitationCenter, Inc., 590 F. 2d 87 (CA4 1978),
cert. denied, 442 U. S. 947 (1979), granted petitioner's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff
did not have "standing" to bring a private action under § 504.
LeStrange v. Consolidated Rail Corporation,501 F. Supp.
964 (MD Pa. 1980).1 In Trageser, the Fourth Circuit had
held that §505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act incorporated
into that Act the limitation found in § 604 of Title VI, which
provides that employment discrimination is actionable only
when the employer receives federal financial assistance the
"primary objective" of which is "to provide employment."
The District Court concluded that the aid provided to petitioner did not satisfy the "primary objective" test.'
IRespondent, the administratrix of LeStrange's estate, was substituted
as a party before this Court upon the death of LeStrange.
'The District Court also dismissed constitutional claims raised by
LeStrange.
' Under the analysis of Trageser,a private plaintiff also may have "standing" to sue for employment discrimination if he can show "that discrimination in employment necessarily causes discrimination against" the intended
beneficiaries of the federal aid, even where that aid itself was not intended
to further employment. App. to Pet. for Cert. 33. The District Court
found as well that this prong of the Trageser test was not satisfied here.

Opinion of the Court

The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded to the District Court. LeStrange v. ConsolidatedRail Corporation,
687 F. 2d 767 (CA3 1982). There was no opinion for the
court, but all three judges of the panel agreed that the cause
of action for employment discrimination under § 504 was not
properly limited to situations "where a primary objective of
the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment."
Judge Bloch, noting that North Haven Board of Education v.
Bell, 456 U. S. 512 (1982), had construed Title IX to create a
private cause of action for employment discrimination in all
federally funded education programs, concluded that the language and legislative history of § 504 required the same broad
construction of that section. Judge Adams, concurring in
the judgment, found the result compelled by North Haven
Board of Education and by the Third Circuit's decision in
Grove City College v. Bell, 687 F. 2d 684 (1982), aff'd, ante,
p. 555.1 Judge Weis, concurring, argued that Congress
had not intended the Rehabilitation Act to incorporate Title
VI's "primary objective" limitation: that limitation was designed to temper the Government's decision to terminate federal funds, a decision that has more drastic consequences for
the funded programs than do private suits for individual
relief.
We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict among the
Circuits and to consider other questions under the Rehabilitation Act.' 459 U. S. 1199 (1983). We affirm.
' The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had held in Grove City College that an entire educational institution is subject to the antidiscrimination provisions of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 if any
department of the institution receives federal aid.
'Three other Courts of Appeals have agreed substantially with the
Fourth Circuit decision in Trageser. See Scanlon v. Atascadero State
Hospital, 677 F. 2d 1271 (CA9 1982); United States v. CabriniMedical
Center, 639 F. 2d 908 (CA2 1981); Carmi v. MetropolitanSt. Louis Sewer
District, 620 F. 2d 672 (CA8), cert. denied, 449 U. S. 892 (1980).

OCTOBER TERM, 1983

III
We are met initially by petitioner's contention that the
death of the plaintiff LeStrange has mooted the case and deprives the Court of jurisdiction for that reason.7 Petitioner
concedes, however, that there remains a case or controversy
if LeStrange's estate may recover money that would have
been owed to LeStrange.8 Without determining the extent
to which money damages are available under § 504, we think
it clear that § 504 authorizes a plaintiff who alleges intentional

discrimination to bring an equitable action for backpay.
case therefore is not moot.

The

In GuardiansAssn. v. Civil Service Comm'n of New York
City, 463 U. S. 582 (1983), a majority of the Court expressed
the view that a private plaintiff under Title VI could recover

backpay; and no Member of the Court contended that backpay was unavailable, at least as a remedy for intentional discrimination.9 It is unnecessary to review here the grounds
'In addition, Conrail argued below, and again in its opening brief, that
§ 504 does not create a private right of action for employment discrimination. This argument was abandoned at page 3 of Conrail's reply brief.
See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 13. In view of this concession it is unnecessary to
address the question here beyond noting that the courts below relied on
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), in holding that
such a private right exists under § 504.
'Petitioner also concedes that respondent, as representative of LeStrange's estate, may assert any right to monetary relief under § 504 that
was possessed by LeStrange.
' A majority of the Court agreed that retroactive relief is available to private plaintiffs for all discrimination, whether intentional or unintentional,

that is actionable under Title VI. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS, joined by JUSTICES BRENNAN and BLACKMUN, argued that both
prospective and retroactive relief were fully available to Title VI plaintiffs.
463 U. S., at 624-634, 635-639. JUSTICE O'CONNOR agreed that both prospective and retroactive equitable relief were available, while reserving
judgment on the question whether there is a private cause of action for
damages relief under Title VI. Id., at 612, n. 1. JUSTICE WHITE, joined

by JUSTICE

REHNQUIST,

while contending that only relief ordering future

compliance with legal obligations was available in other private actions
under Title VI, put aside the situation of the private plaintiff who alleged

Opinion of the Court

for this interpretation of Title VI. It suffices to state that
we now apply this interpretation to § 505(a)(2), which, as we
have noted, provides to plaintiffs under §504 the remedies
set forth in Title VI. Therefore, respondent, having alleged
intentional discrimination, may recover backpay in the present §504 suit.10

IV
A
The Court of Appeals rejected the argument that petitioner may be sued under § 504 only if the primary objective
of the federal aid that it receives is to promote employment.
Conrail relies particularly on § 604 of Title VI. This section
limits the applicability of Title VI to "employment practice[s]
...
where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment" (emphasis added)." As
noted above, § 505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, as added in
1978, adopted the remedies and rights provided in Title VI.
Accordingly, Conrail's basic position in this case is that
intentional discrimination. Id., at 597. THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE POWELL did not reach the question, as they would have held that petitioners in that case had no private right of action and had not made the
showing of intentional discrimination required to establish a violation of
Title VI. Id., at 608-611.
"Although the legislative history of the 1978 amendments does not explicitly indicate that Congress intended to preserve the full measure of
courts' equitable power to award backpay, the few references to the question are consistent with our holding. Congress clearly intended to make
backpay available to victims of discrimination by the Federal Government,
see S. Rep. No. 95-890, p. 19 (1978); and statements made in relation
to subsequent legislation by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources, the Committee responsible for the 1978 amendments, endorse
the availability of backpay. S. Rep. No. 96-316, pp. 12-13 (1979).
" Section 604 provides in full: "Nothing contained in this title shall be
construed to authorize action under this title by any department or agency
with respect to any employment practice of any employer, employment
agency, or labor organization except where a primary objective of the
Federal financial assistance is to provide employment." 78 Stat. 253, 42
U. S. C. §2000d-3.

OCTOBER TERM, 1983

Opinion of the Court

465 U. S.

§ 604's limitation was incorporated expressly into the Rehabilitation Act. The decision of the Court of Appeals therefore should be reversed, Conrail contends, as the primary
objective of the federal assistance received by Conrail was
not to promote employment.
It is clear that §504 itself contains no such limitation. Section 504 neither refers explicitly to §604 nor contains analogous limiting language; rather, that section prohibits discrimination against the handicapped under "any program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance." And it is
unquestionable that the section was intended to reach employment discrimination.12 Indeed, enhancing employment
of the handicapped was so much the focus of the 1973 legislation that Congress the next year felt it necessary to amend
the statute to clarify whether § 504 was intended to prohibit
other types of discrimination as well. See § 111(a), Pub. L.
93-516, 88 Stat. 1619, amending 29 U. S. C. § 706(6); S. Rep.
No. 93-1297, p. 37 (1974).11 Thus, the language of § 504 sug"2Congress recognized that vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped
would be futile if those who were rehabilitated could not obtain jobs because of discrimination. Employment discrimination thus would have "a
profound effect on the provision of relevant and effective [rehabilitation]
services." 119 Cong. Rec. 5862 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Cranston). See,
e. g., S. Rep. No. 93-318, p. 4 (1973); 119 Cong. Rec. 24587 (1973) (remarks
of Sen. Taft); id., at 24588 (remarks of Sen. Williams). Several other sections of Title V of the Rehabilitation Act also were aimed at discrimination
in employment: § 501 and §503 require all federal employers and federal
contractors to adopt affirmative-action programs for the handicapped.
"We note further that the Court in an analogous statutory context rejected the contention that the terms used in § 504 implicitly contain a "primary objective" limitation. Section 901 of Title IX, like § 504, borrowed
the language of § 601 of Title VI. North Haven Board of Education v.
Bell, 456 U. S. 512 (1982), found, however, that Title IX's prohibition of
employment discrimination did not incorporate § 604's "primary objective"
requirement. The Court stated that, had Congress wished so to limit
Title IX, it would have enacted in that Title counterparts to both § 601 and
§604. Id., at 530.
Petitioner suggests that North Haven is inapplicable to the construction
of §504 because the Congress considered but rejected a provision explicitly

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. DARRONE
624

633

Opinion of the Court

gests that its bar on employment discrimination should not
be limited to programs that receive federal aid the primary
purpose of which is to promote employment.
The legislative history, executive interpretation, and purpose of the 1973 enactment all are consistent with this con-

struction. The legislative history contains no mention of a
"primary objective" limitation, although the legislators on
numerous occasions adverted to § 504's prohibition against
incorporating the language of § 604 of Title VI into Title IX. And other
aspects of the legislative history also supported the Court's interpretation
of § 901, see id., at 523-529. In contrast, Congress did not advert to a
"primary objective" limitation when drafting § 504.
Clearly, petitioner's observations do not touch on that aspect of North
Haven-its analysis of the language of § 601-that is relevant to the
present case. But even without the analysis of North Haven, petitioner's
interpretation of § 504's language is unfounded. For language as broad as
that of § 504 cannot be read in isolation from its history and purposes.
See, e. g., Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., 441 U. S. 600, 608
(1979); Philbrook v. Glodgett, 421 U. S. 707, 713 (1975). In these respects, § 504 differs from Title VI in ways that suggest that § 504 cannot
sensibly be interpreted to ban employment discrimination only in programs
that receive federal aid the "primary objective" of which is to promote employment. The "primary objective" limitation of Title VI gave the antidiscrimination provision of that Title a scope that well fits its underlying
purposes-to ensure that "funds of the United States are not used to support racial discrimination" but "are spent in accordance with the Constitution and the moral sense of the Nation." 110 Cong. Rec. 6544 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey). As the Court of Appeals observed, it was
unnecessary to extend Title VI more generally to ban employment discrimination, as Title VII comprehensively regulates such discrimination.
In contrast, the primary goal of the Act is to increase employment of the
handicapped, see supra, at 632, and n. 12. However, Congress chose to
ban employment discrimination against the handicapped, not by all employers, but only by the Federal Government and recipients of federal contracts and grants. As to the latter, Congress apparently determined that
it would require contractors and grantees to bear the costs of providing
employment for the handicapped as a quid pro quo for the receipt of federal
funds. Cf. 118 Cong. Rec. 32305 (1972) (remarks of Sen. Javits). But this
decision to limit § 504 to the recipients of federal aid does not require us to
limit that section still further, as petitioner urges.

discrimination in employment by programs assisted with federal funds. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 93-318, pp. 4, 18, 50, 70
(1973); 119 Cong. Rec. 5862 (1973) (remarks of Sen. Cranston); id., at 24587-24588 (remarks of Sen. Williams, Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare). Moreover, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the
agency designated by the President to be responsible for coordinating enforcement of § 504, see Exec. Order No. 11914,
3 CFR 117 (1977), from the outset has interpreted that section to prohibit employment discrimination by all recipients
of federal financial aid, regardless of the primary objective of
that aid. 4 This Court generally has deferred to contemporaneous regulations issued by the agency responsible for implementing a congressional enactment. See, e. g., NLRB v.
Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U. S. 267, 274-275 (1974). The
regulations particularly merit deference in the present case:
the responsible congressional Committees participated in
their formulation, and both these Committees and Congress
itself endorsed the regulations in their final form."5 Finally,
application of § 504 to all programs receiving federal financial
assistance fits the remedial purpose of the Rehabilitation Act
to "promote and expand employment opportunities" for the
handicapped. 29 U. S. C. § 701(8).
"See 39 Fed. Reg. 18562, 18582 (1974) (revising pre-existing provisions

to implement § 504); 41 Fed. Reg. 29548, 29552, 29563 (1976) (proposed Department regulations), promulgated, 42 Fed. Reg. 22678 (§ 84.2), 22680
(§ 84.11), 22688 ("Employment Practices") (1977); 43 Fed. Reg. 2132, 2138
(1978) (final coordinating regulations).

The Department of Justice, now responsible for coordinating agency
implementation of § 504, see Exec. Order No. 12250, 3 CFR 298 (1981),
adopted the HEW guidelines, 46 Fed. Reg. 40686 (1981). The Department of Transportation, from which Conrail receives federal aid, also has
construed §504 to prohibit employment discrimination in all programs receiving federal financial assistance. 44 Fed. Reg. 31442, 31468 (1979),
codified at 49 CFR pt. 27 (1983). See § 27.31.
"See S.Rep. No. 93-1297, p. 25 (1974). In adopting § 505(a)(2) in the
amendments of 1978, Congress incorporated the substance of the Department's regulations into the statute. See n. 16, infra.

CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION v. DARRONE
624

635

Opinion of the Court

B
Nor did Congress intend to enact the "primary objective"
requirement of § 604 into the Rehabilitation Act when it
amended that Act in 1978. The amendments, as we have
noted, make "available" the remedies, procedures, and rights
of Title VI for suits under § 504 against "any recipient of Federal assistance." §505(a)(2), 29 U. S. C. § 794a(a)(2) (1982
ed.). These terms do not incorporate § 604's "primary objective" limitation. Rather, the legislative history reveals that
this section was intended to codify the regulations of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare governing enforcement of § 504, see S. Rep. No. 95-890, p. 19 (1978), that
prohibited employment discrimination regardless of the purpose of federal financial assistance."6 And it would be anomalous to conclude that the section, "designed to enhance the
ability of handicapped individuals to assure compliance with
[§ 504]," id., at 18, silently adopted a drastic limitation on the
handicapped individual's right to sue federal grant recipients
for employment discrimination.
V
Section 504, by its terms, prohibits discrimination only by
a "program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." This Court on two occasions has considered the
meaning of the terms "program or activity" as used in Title
16 The Committee noted: "[T]he regulations promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to procedures, remedies, and rights under §504 conform with those promulgated under title
VI. Thus, this amendment codifies existing practice as a specific statutory requirement." S. Rep. No. 95-890, p. 19 (1978). Although these
Department regulations incorporated Title VI regulations governing "complaint and enforcement procedures," see 42 Fed. Reg. 22685, 22694-22701
(1977), the regulations implementing § 504 did not incorporate § 80.3 of
the Title VI regulations, which limit Title VI's application to employment
discrimination in federal programs to increase employment. The §504
regulations banned employment discrimination in programs receiving any
form of federal financial assistance. See n. 14, supra.

IX. Grove City College v. Bell, ante, p. 555; North Haven
Board of Education v. Bell, 456 U. S. 512, 535-540 (1982).
Clearly, this language limits the ban on discrimination to
the specific program that receives federal funds. Neither
opinion, however, provides particular guidance as to the
appropriate treatment of the programs before us. Grove
City College considered grants of financial aid to students.
The Court specifically declined to analogize these grants to
nonearmarked direct grants and, indeed, characterized them
as "sui generis." Ante, at 573. North Haven Board of
Educationdid not undertake to define the term "program" at
all, finding that, in the procedural posture of that case, that17
task should be left to the District Court in the first instance.
456 U. S., at 540.
The procedural posture of the case before us is the same
as that of North Haven Board of Education. The District
Court granted a motion for summary judgment on grounds
unrelated to the issue of "program specificity." That judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeals and the case was
remanded for further proceedings. Thus, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals below considered the
question whether respondent's decedent had sought and been
denied employment in a "program ... receiving Federal financial assistance."" Nor did the District Court develop the
record or make the factual findings that would be required to
define the relevant "program." We therefore do not consider whether federal financial assistance was received by the
"program or activity" that discriminated against LeStrange. 19
7

The Court held that the Court of Appeals in that case had erroneously

suggested that HEW regulations issued under Title XI to govern employment discrimination need not be program specific. See 456 U. S., at 536.
"Although Judge Adams cited the Third Circuit opinion in Grove City

College, he did so merely to support his rejection of the Trageser "standing" analysis. See supra, at 629.
