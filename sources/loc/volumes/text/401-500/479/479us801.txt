JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins,
dissenting.
Petitioner Anthony Grandison was sentenced to death by an improperly instructed jury and did not have the benefit of representation at his sentencing hearing. Because I believe that the
jury's instructions under the Maryland statute improperly shifted
to petitioner the burden of disproving the appropriateness of his
death sentence, and that the denial of a request for legal representation in the sentencing phase of a bifurcated capital proceeding
constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,
I dissent.
I

Petitioner was tried for murder, conspiracy to commit murder,
and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, for
hiring someone to kill two witnesses scheduled to testify against
him in his trial on federal drug charges. The jury found petitioner guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death. Petitioner claims that the Maryland capital sentencing statute and
the verdict sheet provided to the jury improperly imposed upon

him the burden of proof at the sentencing phase. I continue to
believe that this issue is worthy of review. See Huffington v.
Maryland, 478 U. S. 1023 (1986) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from
denial of certiorari); Stebbing v. Maryland, 469 U. S. 900 (1984)
(MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).
The State argues that petitioner's claim is foreclosed by a statecourt construction of the statute holding that the prosecution
bears the burden of persuasion. See Foster v. State, 304 Md.
439, 476-480, 499 A. 2d 1236, 1256-1257 (1985). In this case,
however, the jury was provided with a verdict sheet that unambiguously directed the jurors to return a sentence of death unless
mitigating circumstances outweighed aggravating circumstances.
The Maryland Court of Appeals may construe the statute to avoid
any constitutional difficulty. But the trial court's instructions and
the verdict form submitted to the jury must reflect that construction. Here, the verdict form did not; the constitutional infirmity
therefore remains undiminished.
II
At his arraignment, petitioner asserted the right to represent
himself under Faretta v. California,422 U. S. 806 (1975). Petitioner was informed of his right to counsel, the dangers of selfrepresentation, and the advantages of having counsel to assist
at trial and sentencing. Petitioner nonetheless chose to proceed
pro se. He was granted the right to have "standby" counsel, but
conducted his own defense. The jury returned a verdict of guilty
on all counts.
At the first scheduled sentencing proceeding, petitioner asked
the court to appoint the lawyer who had served as standby counsel
to represent him in the sentencing proceeding. He also sought
a continuance, since neither he nor his counsel was prepared to
go forward. The court refused to terminate petitioner's selfrepresentation, stating:
"Once the decision is made regarding self-representation, if
it is properly made prior to trial, the request to change rests
solely within the discretion of the trial court. The right must
be timely asserted.
It must be asserted before the trial
starts. Of course, this is not timely asserted. Whether we
continue with it or not, what I am inclined to do about selfrepresentation is leave it just like it is, and let [standby counsel] take over and handle the proceeding as standby counsel

attorney." Pet. for Cert. 8-9.

Grandison will still be the

Moreover, the court instructed standby counsel: "Keep in mind,
Mr. Crawford, you are not the attorney in this. Mr. Grandison is
his own attorney. You are just kind of a law clerk." Id., at 9.
The court granted an 8-day continuance; at the reconvened sentencing hearing, it again made clear that Grandison was representing himself, albeit with the assistance of standby counsel.
Assuming for the sake of argument that in a nonbifurcated
criminal proceeding a trial judge could in some circumstances deny
a defendant who initially asserted his right to represent himself
the right to later change his mind and proceed with counsel, such
a rule would not imply that a waiver of counsel in the guilt phase
of a capital proceeding requires a defendant to proceed pro se,
against his will, in the sentencing phase. The Maryland Court of
Appeals cursorily dismissed petitioner's claim that, because capital
sentencing constituted a separate trial, he was entitled to make a
new decision about whether he wanted counsel or not. 305 Md.
685, 752, 506 A. 2d 580, 613 (1986). I find this claim worthy of
considerably more attention than the Maryland court gave it.
In Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U. S. 430 (1981), this Court
held that the Double Jeopardy Clause applied to the sentencing
phase of a bifurcated trial. It did so because it found that a
sentencing hearing was like a separate trial. "The presentence
hearing resembled and, indeed, in all relevant respects was like
the immediately preceding trial on the issue of guilt or innocence.
It was itself a trial on the issue of punishment." Id., at 438.
Under the Maryland statute, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, § 413 (1982
and Supp. 1986), sentencing is similarly a separate adversarial
proceeding, see § 413(a). It may require selection of a new jury,
see §§413(b)(2)(i)-(iv). Evidence is offered, §413(c)(1); the parties may present argument, §413(c)(2); the jury is instructed,
§413(c)(3); and the jury deliberates and determines sentence.
The Maryland proceeding is in all respects a separate trial on the
issue of punishment. The waiver of the right to counsel at the
first "trial" on guilt or innocence should therefore have no more
bearing on a defendant's right to counsel in the sentencing phase
than it would on that defendant's right to counsel in a separate
trial on related crimes. It should under no circumstances irrevocably bind a defendant in the sentencing phase.

OCTOBER TERM, 1986

479 U. S.

The trial court articulated no basis for refusing petitioner's request to appoint counsel. Even at midtrial in a nonbifurcated proceeding, a trial court's unexplained refusal to permit a defendant
to revoke his assertion of the right to self-representation would
surely constitute an abuse of discretion. A trial court cannot insist
that a defendant continue representing himself out of some punitive
notion 'that that defendant, having made his bed, should be compelled to lie in it. Yet in this case, where petitioner's right to counsel was triggered anew by the start of a new trial on the issue of
punishment, the trial court refused, entirely without justification,
to permit him to assert that right to counsel. This refusal deprived
petitioner of his constitutional right to be represented during his
sentencing hearing. Accordingly, I dissent.*

JUSTICE MARSHALL,

Petitioner Donald Dufour was convicted of capital murder occurring in the course of a robbery. His appointed counsel presented
no evidence in mitigation of sentence at the penalty phase of his
trial. The jury found that the State had established two aggravating circumstances and recommended a sentence of death. The
State Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death
sentence. Dufour v. State, 453 So. 2d 337 (1984). This Court
denied certiorari. Dufour v. Mississippi, 469 U. S. 1230 (1985).
Petitioner then instituted a postconviction proceeding to vacate
judgment and sentence in the state trial court, contending that he

479 U. S.

had received ineffective assistance of counsel in that his appointed
trial counsel had failed to request appointment of a psychiatrist
to assist the defense in developing psychological evidence to be
submitted to the jury in mitigation of sentence. The trial court
summarily denied this and petitioner's other claims, and the State
Supreme Court affirmed. 483 So. 2d 307 (1986).
It appears that in his postconviction application, petitioner again
requested appointment of a psychiatrist to assist counsel in showing
that petitioner's defense at the penalty phase of his trial was prejudiced by the absence of psychological evidence. He submitted the
affidavit of Dr. Stanley, the court-appointed psychiatrist who had
previously examined him for the purpose of determining his competency to stand trial. Dr. Stanley stated that the limited examination he had conducted for purposes of determining competency bore
no relation to the more extensive and qualitatively different investigation required to present useful assistance to trial counsel on the
subject of mitigation. Pet. for Cert. 7. Both the trial court and
State Supreme Court denied relief without ruling on petitioner's renewed request for the appointment of a psychiatrist; no evidentiary
hearing was held on petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance.
The State Supreme Court affirmed the denial of relief, stating:
"Petitioner claims that defense counsel failed to make application to the trial court for funds to conduct a psychological evaluation of petitioner for the purpose of determining
whether mitigating circumstances existed. Further, that he
had no expert assistance because counsel did not request it.
However, petitioner was examined pursuant to a court order.
The professionals were not people selected by the State, but by
the trial court. Petitioner has failed to present facts which
show there existed mitigating circumstances of a psychological
nature, which could have been presented by Dr. Stanley. It is
not shown that such an examination would have produced the
claimed results, nor has prejudice been shown." 483 So. 2d,
at 308.
II
In Strickland, supra, this Court established a two-part standard for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
"First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was
deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed

ORDERS
891

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant
must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.
This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to
deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable." Id., at 687. For the reasons I then stated in dissent,
I continue to believe that "a showing that the performance of a
defendant's lawyer departed from constitutionally prescribed
standards requires a new trial regardless of whether the defendant suffered demonstrable prejudice thereby." Id., at 712. The
present case provides a graphic demonstration of the untenable
nature of the prejudice standard announced in Strickland.
The State Supreme Court, in affirming the denial of postconviction relief on this claim, relied entirely upon the prejudice
portion of the Strickland standard. 483 So. 2d, at 308. Petitioner's claim was denied because he did not proffer the psychiatric
evidence which he contended should have been introduced at trial.
He did not do so precisely because, as an indigent, he could not
afford to retain a psychiatrist to make an examination either in
preparation for trial or upon his application for postconviction
relief. In short, the prejudice standard in such a circumstance
is insurmountable; prejudice cannot be shown because the alleged
error of counsel was in failing to seek the appointment of an expert
without whose assistance the evidence which would show prejudice
cannot be brought to light. On a claim of this kind petitioner cannot submit affidavits of witnesses who were not investigated or
who were not called, or in some other manner raise an inference
as to prejudice. The essence of psychiatric evidence rests in the
expert qualifications of the objective examiner; if the examiner will
not volunteer his services, petitioner must content himself with
only so much justice as he can pay for.
In Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 80 (1985), this Court recognized that under some circumstances "the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his
defense," and that in these conditions the accused is entitled to the
appointment of psychiatric assistance at public expense. That the
failure to seek such appointment to assist counsel in the development of evidence in mitigation of sentence may in some cases rise
to the level of constitutionally ineffective assistance I do not

doubt.' "[C]ounsel's general duty to investigate . . . takes on
supreme importance to a defendant in the context of developing
mitigating evidence to present to a judge or jury considering the
sentence of death; claims of ineffective assistance in the performance of that duty should therefore be considered with commensurate care." Strickland, 466 U. S., at 706 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).2 The prejudice prong of
Strickland, as it was applied below, will have the effect of depriving all such defendants of their constitutional rights solely as a
result of their indigence. Because I believe that such application
of the Strickland standard is incompatible with the requirements
of the Constitution, I would grant the petition for certiorari.

11 would not reach the question whether counsel's failure in this case to
move for the appointment of a psychiatrist was constitutionally deficient
representation under the first part of the test established by Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The correctness of the State Supreme
Court's determination on the question of prejudice is the sole issue posed by

the petition.
2 note that petitioner's trial counsel failed to present any evidence at all in
mitigation of sentence. As I have previously stated, I believe that in all but
the most extraordinary cases, such failure is, without more, a denial of effective assistance of counsel. See Berry v. King, 476 U. S. 1164 (1986) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).

MARSHALL,

I
Petitioner became a suspect in the disappearance of Kimberly
Leach after local authorities learned that he was suspected in a
number of murders in the northwestern United States. Leach
was reported missing from school on February 9, 1978, and her
body was found two months later, after a highly publicized search.
The only eyewitness to the abduction was Clarence Anderson.
He came forward on July 18, after seeing petitioner on a television newscast. At that time, Anderson was unable to identify the
date of his observation, although he thought it was "around
April," and he could not provide a detailed description of the man
or the girl he had observed. App. to Pet. for Cert. A17-A21.
At the request of the Assistant State Attorney, Anderson underwent two hypnotic sessions designed to refresh his recollection.
Petitioner moved to suppress Anderson's testimony due to the
lapse of time between Leach's disappearance and his initial statement, the massive publicity surrounding her disappearance and
petitioner's arrest and indictment, and an alleged misuse of hypnosis by the persons conducting the sessions. He maintained that
these factors rendered Anderson's identification unreliable under
the rule established by this Court's decision in Neil v. Biggers, 409
U. S. 188 (1972). At the suppression hearing, several experts
testified that a witness whose recollection has been hypnotically
refreshed is unable to distinguish between what he recollected before hypnosis and any "details" added during hypnosis.
The trial court denied petitioner's motion to suppress. At trial,
Anderson testified that he had observed a man leading a young girl
into a white van near Leach's junior high school on February 9,
1978. He identified the man as petitioner and the girl as Kimberly
Leach. Anderson's testimony was vital to the State's case; it supplied "the crucial link in the chain of circumstantial evidence of
[petitioner's] guilt." 471 So. 2d 9, 23 (Fla. 1985) (Boyd, C. J., concurring specially).
On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court agreed with petitioner's
arguments against the use of hypnotically refreshed testimony.
Id., at 18. The court noted that the highest courts of several
other States have categorically excluded hypnotically refreshed
testimony. E. g., People v. Shirley, 31 Cal. 3d 18, 641 P. 2d 775,
cert. denied, 458 U. S. 1125 (1982); People v. Gonzales, 415 Mich.
615, 329 N. W. 2d 743 (1982). The court discussed several of the
problems associated with such testimony, not the least of which is

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
MARSHALL,

its effect on the defendant's right under the Confrontation Clause
of the Sixth Amendment to cross-examine witnesses against him.
The Florida court noted the "'danger of distortion, delusion, or
fantasy,"' as well as "'the barriers which hypnosis raises to effective cross-examination."' 471 So. 2d, at 18 (quoting People v.
Gonzales, supra, at 627, 329 N. W. 2d, at 748). Furthermore,
the court recognized the danger that, after undergoing hypnosis,
"the subject (1) will lose his critical judgment and begin to
credit 'memories' that were formerly viewed as unreliable, (2)
will confuse actual recall with confabulation and will be unable
to distinguish between the two, and (3) will exhibit an unwarranted confidence in the validity of his ensuing recollection."
471 So. 2d, at 17 (quoting People v. Shirley, supra, at 39, 641
P. 2d, at 787).
The Florida Supreme Court concluded, in a holding to which it
gave only prospective effect, that "hypnotically refreshed testimony is per se inadmissible in a criminal trial in this state, but
hypnosis does not render a witness incompetent to testify to those
facts demonstrably recalled prior to hypnosis." 471 So. 2d, at 18.
II
Since petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death after a
trial in which the "crucial link" was supplied by a witness with extremely limited prehypnotic memory who had undergone two hypnotic sessions, the Florida Supreme Court should have overturned
his conviction. Instead, the court somehow determined that Anderson's testimony was refreshed under hypnosis as to only three
details: the color of the football jersey the girl was wearing, the
numbers on the jersey, and the fact that the man was wearing
a pullover sweater and a shirt. Then, purporting to apply the
"harmless-constitutional-error rule" of Schneble v. Florida, 405
U. S. 427 (1972), and Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U. S. 85 (1963),
the court concluded: "[S]ufficient evidence does exist, absent the
tainted testimony, upon which the jury could have based its conviction of Bundy. There is no reasonable possibility that the tainted
testimony complained of might have contributed to the conviction."
471 So. 2d, at 19.
This review for harmless constitutional error is seriously
flawed. First, the Florida court improperly based its enumeration of tainted testimony on Anderson's own testimony at trial.

ORDERS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

App. to Pet. for Cert. A86-A87. Anderson's own assessment of
the impact of hypnosis on his recollection was inherently unreliable and was not subject to effective cross-examination, for the
very reasons the court relied upon in holding that such evidence
would in the future be inadmissible. The hypnotically refreshed
"recollection" of the precise date of his observation is the most
glaring omission from Anderson's list.' Having identified constitutional error in the admission of hypnotically refreshed testimony, the Florida Supreme Court was not free to excise a fraction
of that evidence and conclude that the rest could not have contributed to the conviction. Second, the Florida court evidently
confused review for harmless constitutional error with review for
sufficiency of the evidence, despite this Court's explanation of
the difference in Fahy: "We are not concerned here with whether
there was sufficient evidence on which the petitioner could have
been convicted without the evidence complained of. The question
is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction." 375 U. S.,
at 86-87. Cf. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 684 (1986);
Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 23 (1967). When the evidence admitted at petitioner's trial is reviewed in this light it
becomes clear that the tainted testimony significantly bolstered the
State's case against him, for the untainted evidence was far from
overwhelming.
"We must recognize that harmless-error rules can work very
unfair and mischievous results when, for example, highly important and persuasive evidence . . . though legally forbidden, finds
its way into a trial in which the question of guilt or innocence is a
close one." Id., at 22. Because the Florida Supreme Court misapplied the harmless-constitutional-error rule in such a way as to

IOne of petitioner's experts testified at the pretrial suppression hearing
that Anderson's testimony was "enhanced" by numerous details in addition to
the date of the occurrence and the three items listed by Anderson. These enhancements included what Anderson was doing on that day, the man's weight,
the fact that he was clean shaven, the description of the van, and the fact that
he could see the man and the girl through its rear window. Pet. for Cert. 12.

conclusion as to harmless error.

JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins,
dissenting.
I would grant this petition for certiorari to consider the extent
of the obligations our decision in Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S. 209
(1982), imposes on a trial judge confronted with a claim of juror
bias.
I

Petitioner Anthony Porter was convicted of two murders committed in the course of an armed robbery and was sentenced to
death. During voir dire, the trial judge read a list of potential witnesses, including the mother of Marilyn Green, one of the victims.
He did not ask whether any of the prospective jurors knew any of
the persons on the list, and none of them volunteered that they did.
After the jury returned a guilty verdict, petitioner waived his right
to a jury at the penalty proceeding. Before the judge dismissed
the jurors, however, he addressed them as follows:
"THE COURT: ... It was brought to my attention before I
actually formally dismissed you that one of the jurors stated
that he knew that some other juror purportedly or allegedly
went to church-to the same church as one of the decedent's
mother. Is that right, was that you-please identify yourself.
"MRS. TRICKLET:[*] Yes, but that didn't make any difference to me about that.
"THE COURT: Thank you, ma'am. It didn't make any
difference?
"MRS. TRICKLET: No.
2 Since the Florida Supreme Court found constitutional error and the State
has not cross-petitioned for certiorari on that question, this Court is not called
upon to decide whether admission of hypnotically refreshed testimony in a
criminal trial violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
or the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Accordingly, I express no view on this question.
*The trial transcript incorrectly lists the juror's name as Tricklet, rather
than Trigleth.

J., dissenting

"THE COURT: Ma'am, your name again?
"MRS. TRICKLET: Lilly B. Tricklet.
"THE COURT: It didn't make any difference to you, you

read you the name of all the witnesses in the beginning before
we even started, you didn't recognize that?
"MRS. TRICKLET: No.
"THE COURT: When did you finally recognize"MRS. TRICKLET: After it had got started and everything was going on.

all dismissed." 111 Ill. 2d 386, 397-398, 489 N. E. 2d 1329,
1333 (1986).
Defense counsel was not permitted to question Mrs. Trigleth.
After he suggested that "the Court should have questioned this
juror in detail as to her relationship to that family," id., at 398,
489 N. E. 2d, at 1334, the judge made the following statement:
"This Court will state for the record that in an unusual proceeding, I think probably the most unusual I have ever engaged in in all my years as a lawyer and as a Judge, I did
bring back the entire jury and I had not dismissed them and
the lady that identified herself was under oath and said for
the record that the facts that came to light after the case,
sometime after the case had commenced, in earnest, didn't influence her whatsoever.
"Accordingly, this Court felt that going beyond that regarding that issue is not -would not have been proper, would have
invaded the sanctity of the jury and jury deliberation. Mr.
Porter talked to and did, in fact request and have his constitutional right to a jury. That lady was under oath. She was
not on trial, Mr. Porter was." Id., at 413-414, 489 N. E. 2d,
at 1341 (emphasis supplied).
Petitioner moved for a new trial. He submitted the affidavit of
Isaias Torres, the juror who had brought the matter to the court's
attention. In his affidavit, Torres stated that "a fellow juror informed him that another juror sitting in judgment of the facts

with them ... knew the deceased, Marilyn Green's mother and
attended church with her." Id., at 402, 489 N. E. 2d, at 1335.
He further stated that "this same Black female juror, when the
jury was given the case to deliberate on, entered the jury room
and said as far as she was concerned, they could vote guilty right
then, and she made this statement before any discussion was had
on the evidence . . ." Ibid. (emphasis supplied). At the hearing on petitioner's motion for a new trial, which was held before
the same judge, Mrs. Trigleth was not called as a witness. After
a brief oral argument, the judge denied the motion.
The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's denial of
petitioner's motion for a new trial, with three justices dissenting.
Although the State Supreme Court recognized that the trial court's
inquiry "could have, and possibly should have, been more searching," it considered the ruling to be within the trial judge's "sound
discretion." Id., at 403, 489 N. E. 2d, at 1336.
The State
Supreme Court concluded: "The burden in this case was on the defendant to support the allegations of his post-trial motion ....
Not
only should the defendant have shown the nature of the relationship
between the juror and the victim's mother, but he also had the burden of showing that he was prejudiced by this juror's service."
Id., at 404, 489 N. E. 2d, at 1336.
II
The right to a trial by an impartial jury lies at the heart of due
process. See, e. g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 721-722 (1961).
This Court has held that due process requires both "a jury capable
and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and
a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and
to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen."
Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S., at 217. When a substantial question
of juror bias is presented to the trial court, as it was in this case,
we have held that the defendant is entitled to a hearing "'with all
interested parties permitted to participate."' Id., at 216 (quoting
Remmer v. United States, 347 U. S. 227, 230 (1954)).
Under Smith v. Phillips, supra, the trial judge's inquiry into
juror bias in this case fell far short of the minimum required
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The
judge merely called on the juror to identify herself and then asked
her "several times in a leading fashion to reaffirm that her ac-

ORDERS

J., dissenting

quaintance with the mother did not influence her" in a colloquy
that "could have lasted only seconds." 111 Ill. 2d, at 410, 489
N. E. 2d, at 1339 (Simon, J., dissenting). The trial judge failed
to ascertain to any meaningful degree the extent and nature of her
relationship with the victim's mother and the point at which she
became aware that she was acquainted with the mother. The juror's vague statement that she realized it "[a]fter it had got
started and everything was going on" suggests only that she was
not aware of it at voir dire. She was never asked to explain why
she had not brought the matter to the court's attention when she
realized the connection; had she done so, one of the alternate
jurors could have taken her place. Moreover, the trial court did
not allow defense counsel to question her.
The State contends that petitioner had an opportunity to explore the issue of bias at the post-trial hearing on his motion for
a new trial. That hearing, however, was woefully inadequate
when measured by our decisions in Phillips and Remmer. At a
minimum, due process requires that the defendant be allowed to
question the juror on the issue of bias. See Smith v. Phillips,
455 U. S., at 217, n. 7 ("[D]eterminations made in Remmer-type
hearings will frequently turn upon testimony of the juror in question"); see also id., at 222 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring). The Illinois Supreme Court criticized defense counsel for failing to call
Mrs. Trigleth or obtain an affidavit from her, 111 Ill. 2d, at 403,
489 N. E. 2d, at 1336. However, in light of the trial judge's insistence on the sanctity of the jury's deliberation and his refusal
to allow defense counsel to question Mrs. Trigleth while she was
under oath, counsel reasonably considered himself foreclosed from
contacting her in connection with his motion for a new trial before
the same judge. Thus, while petitioner had the burden of showing both bias and actual prejudice, the trial judge's admonitions
appeared to deprive him of the only means of doing so.
I continue to believe that the defendant should not bear the burden of showing actual prejudice when the probability of bias is
substantial, as it is in this case, see Smith v. Phillips, supra, at
224 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, petitioner never even
had the opportunity of demonstrating prejudice due to juror bias.
This violated his right to due process and leaves in doubt the
impartiality of the jury that convicted him in this capital case.
Accordingly, I dissent from denial of the petition for certiorari.

227 (1976), I would grant certiorari and vacate the death sentence
in this case.
JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
Her conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and
this Court denied certiorari. Buttrum v. State, 249 Ga. 652, 293
S. E. 2d 334 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U. S.1156 (1983). The present petition seeks review of a subsequent denial of state habeas
corpus relief in state court. Adhering to my view that the death
penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment
forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia insofar as it left
undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v.
Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).
However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless
would, at the very least, delay the disposition of this petition until
California v. Brown, No. 85-1563, is decided.
In closing argument at the sentencing phase of petitioner's trial,
the prosecutor incorporated statements from an 1873 decision of
the Georgia Supreme Court that appear with some regularity in
contemporary capital sentencing proceedings in that State. See
Eberhart v. State, 47 Ga. 598, 609-610; Ruffin v. State, 243 Ga.
95, 105, 252 S.E. 2d 472, 479-480 (1979). The effect of these
statements was to lead the jury to believe that mercy was not a
permissible component of their sentencing determination:
"You took an oath at the beginning of the case. You said, 'I
do', to 'You shall well and truly try the issue formed upon this
Bill of Indictment . . .and a true verdict give according to

evidence. So Help You God.' 'According to evidence'; not
according to mercy, not according to sympathy, not according
to feeling sorry for a Defendant .... Mercy?

I submit to you

that we should have no sympathy with that sentiment that
springs into action whenever a criminal is about to suffer for a

crime. Society demands that the crime be punished and criminals warned. The false humanity that starts and shudders
when the axe of justice is about to fall is a dangerous element
for the peace of society. We have had too much of this mercy.
It is not true mercy. It only looks to the criminal. . . .A
stern, unbending, unflinching administration of justice is the
surest way to prevent the commission of other heinous and
horrible acts like the one committed by that Defendant. We
are a society of Laws, not of sentiment." App. to Pet. for
Cert. A-4, pp. 17-18.
On more than one occasion, the Georgia Supreme Court has condemned use of the statements employed by the prosecutor in petitioner's sentencing hearing-at least where they are attributed to
a justice of that court-though it has generally found their effect
insufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal of the death sentences imposed. See, e. g., Ruffin, supra, at 105, 252 S. E. 2d,
at 479-480; Hawes v. State, 240 Ga. 327, 335-336, 240 S. E. 2d
833, 840 (1977). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
has rejected use of this same language, regardless of the spokesman, because its content does not relate to the particular circumstances of the defendant whose sentence is being determined, but
rather implies that considerations of mercy can have no part in
jury deliberations in capital sentencing proceedings. See, e. g.,
Wilson v. Kemp, 777 F. 2d 621, 626-628 (1985), cert. denied, 476
U. S. 1153 (1986); Drake v. Kemp, 762 F. 2d 1449, 1458-1461
(1985), cert. denied, 478 U. S. 1020 (1986). These divergent opinions from the Eleventh Circuit and the Georgia Supreme Court
raise serious questions as to the constitutionally permissible scope
of prosecutorial comment on the role of mercy in the jury's sentencing decision. Because we granted certiorari in California v.
Brown, supra, to decide a closely related issue, I dissent from the
present denial of this petition.

sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally
under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari
because this petition presents an important issue concerning the
application of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.
Petitioner William Theodore Boliek, Jr., was charged with the
murder of Jody Harless. The State alleged that Boliek shot Harless twice, once in the stomach and once in the head, in order to
prevent her from testifying about a robbery in which she had been
an accomplice. Boliek admitted that he had fired the first, nonfatal shot, which he claimed was an accident; he contended that
the second and fatal shot had been fired by Vernon Wait, another
of the participants in the robbery. At petitioner's trial the State
produced two witnesses to whom Jody Harless had said, in the days
immediately preceding her death, that she was afraid petitioner
was going to kill her. In his summation, the prosecutor told the
jury: "'Jody Harless, one of her last words was "Ted Boliek's gonna
blow my head off." And he did it."' Pet. for Cert. 5.
The Missouri Supreme Court rejected petitioner's contention
that it was reversible error to admit this evidence. State v.
Boliek, 706 S. W. 2d 847 (1986). The Court held the evidence admissible under the hearsay exception for statements of the declarant's present mental condition. Id., at 850. One judge dissented
from this holding, taking the position that the statements were
not admissible because the victim's state of mind was not material
to the State's case. Petitioner contends that the admission of this
hearsay violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.
In Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U. S. 56 (1980), this Court held that the
statement of an unavailable declarant "is admissible only if it bears
adequate 'indicia of reliability.' Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted
hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded,
at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness." Id., at 66. The State contends that the challenged
evidence met this standard because the statements were admitted
under a recognized hearsay exception. Missouri has not codified
its law of evidence, and while it has been said that "[u]nder Missouri law the declarations of the decedent in a homicide case are
admissible to prove the decedent's state of mind where that is relevant," Lenza v. Wyrick, 665 F. 2d 804, 810 (CA8 1981), the Mis-

ORDERS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

souri courts have recognized: "[D]eclarations revealing a state of
mind often contain recitals of circumstantial facts. They are not
admissible to prove the truth of such recitals." State v. Singh, 586
S. W. 2d 410, 418 (Mo. App. 1979).
There can be no doubt, given the use made of the evidence by
the State in summation, that the testimony as to the victim's
statements was admitted to prove not her state of mind, but the
truth of her belief that petitioner intended to kill her. Cf. Fed.
Rule Evid. 803(3) (statements of memory and belief not admissible
"to prove the fact remembered or believed").
It is precisely
to avoid the possibility of such use of "state of mind" evidence
that at least eight States and one Federal Court of Appeals have
precluded or sharply limited the introduction of evidence of the
victim's state of mind in homicide cases.* Under these circumstances, I do not believe that the evidence in this case was admitted under a "firmly rooted" hearsay exception. See Ohio v. Roberts, supra, at 66. I do not take Ohio v. Roberts to mean that
any hearsay evidence which can be squeezed under the rubric of a
state hearsay exception has met the reliability standard required
by the Sixth Amendment.
See Dutton v. Evans, 400 U. S. 74,
105 (1970) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). When evidence nominally
received under a particular hearsay exception is presented for
purposes other than those the exception was designed to serve,
the constitutional analysis should not end with the mere semantic
invocation of the rule. The challenged evidence in this case was
not accompanied by any independent indicia of reliability. As the
dissent below rightly pointed out, it was completely immaterial to
the jury's consideration of petitioner's defense of accident. The
only function served by the evidence, and one which the prosecutor specifically emphasized in summation, was to raise an impermissible inference for the jury as to premeditation and intent on
petitioner's part. Because I believe that the receipt of this evidence under these circumstances creates a serious Confrontation
Clause issue, I would grant the petition for certiorari.

JUSTICE

MARSHALL,

JUSTICE

BRENNAN

Certiojoins,

dissenting.
Petitioner was sentenced to death by a jury whose sentencing
determination was biased impermissibly in favor of death. Because I believe that, under this Court's decisions in Godfrey v.
Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), and Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.
862 (1983), the fact that a murder was committed during the
course of a robbery cannot serve both as an element of the capital
offense and as the factual predicate for two statutory aggravating
circumstances, I would grant certiorari in this case.
Petitioner William Wiley was convicted of a murder committed
during a robbery and was sentenced to death. The Mississippi
Supreme Court affirmed the jury's determination of guilt, but remanded for resentencing due to the prosecutor's improper references to appellate review. Wiley v. State, 449 So. 2d 756 (1984).
At the second sentencing proceeding, petitioner once again received
a sentence of death. The jury found three statutory aggravating
circumstances and insufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances. The Mississippi Supreme
Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence, with
three justices concurring in the judgment. 484 So. 2d 339 (1986).
Under Mississippi law, all murder is not capital murder. The
death sentence may be imposed only where the murder falls into
one of seven narrowly defined classes. Miss. Code Ann. §§ 97-319(2)(a)-(g) (Supp. 1985). Petitioner was convicted under a section of the statute that classifies murder committed by a person
engaged in a robbery as capital murder. § 97-3-19(2)(e). Once
the jury found him guilty of the capital offense, it then had to find
at least one aggravating circumstance, in order to impose the death
penalty. See §§ 99-19-101(5)(a)-(h) (Supp. 1985) (listing aggravating circumstances). In this case, the jury found three statutory
aggravating circumstances: "[t]he capital offense was committed
while the defendant was engaged .. . in the commission of, or an
attempt to commit, any robbery," "[t]he capital offense was committed for pecuniary gain," and "[t]he capital offense was especially
heinous, atrocious or cruel." §§ 99-19-101(5)(d), (e), and (h). Two
of these circumstances -that the offense was committed while petitioner was engaged in a robbery, and that it was committed for pe-

ORDERS

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

cuniary gain-would automatically be present in any killing that
took place during a robbery.
"Our cases indicate... that statutory aggravating circumstances
play a constitutionally necessary function at the stage of legislative
definition: they circumscribe the class of persons eligible for the
death penalty." Zant v. Stephens, supra, at 878. Aggravating
circumstances provide a "'meaningful basis for distinguishing
the few cases in which [death] is imposed from the many cases in
which it is not,"' Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, POWELL, and STEVENS, JJ.) (quoting Furman v.
Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 313 (1972) (WHITE, J., concurring)). In
Godfrey v. Georgia, supra, this Court struck down an aggravating circumstance so vaguely worded that it failed to perform this
narrowing function. In Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.
280 (1976), we also rejected mandatory death sentences for specified offenses as constitutionally unacceptable, stating: "'[J]ustice
generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts
by which the crime was committed . . . .' [W]e believe that in
capital cases the fundamental respect for humanity underlying the
Eighth Amendment . . . requires consideration of the character
and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the
particular offense as a constitutionally indispensible part of the
process of inflicting the penalty of death." Id., at 304 (plurality
opinion) (quoting Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302 U. S.
51, 55 (1937)).
Under Mississippi's sentencing scheme, as applied in this case,
all persons convicted of robbery-murder enter the sentencing phase
with two built-in aggravating circumstances, creating a strong
presumption in favor of death. In cases where no mitigating or
additional aggravating evidence is introduced, these aggravating
circumstances have not narrowed the class of death-eligible persons
at all. See Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325 (1976) (plurality
opinion) (mandatory death sentences even for narrowly defined category of murders held unconstitutional). I believe that the use
of aggravating factors which repeat an element of the underlying
capital offense creates a substantial risk that death will be inflicted
in an arbitrary and capricious manner.'
A grant of certiorari would enable the Court to resolve a conflict among
the Circuits on this issue.
In Gray v. Lucas, 677 F. 2d 1086, 1105 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U. S. 910
(1983), decided before Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862 (1983), the Fifth Cir-

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

479 U. S.

Not only do two of the three aggravating circumstances found by
the jury repeat elements of the underlying capital offense, they
both rest on the same underlying facts. 2 The Mississippi Supreme
Court has not limited the aggravating circumstance of "committed
for pecuniary gain" to murder for hire or any other narrow category of murders. Accordingly, any murder committed during the
course of a robbery is ipso facto committed for pecuniary gain.
The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected petitioner's arguments
against double counting these aggravating circumstances, over the
objection of a concurring justice who stated: "[T]he fallacy of our
rule is its failure to recognize that murders are aggravated by a
defendant's conduct, not by the statutory language ....
A single,
legally indivisible act of the defendant may rationallyaggravate a
murder but once." 484 So. 2d, at 358 (Robertson, J., concurring)
(emphasis in original).
The State Supreme Court relied on the fact that the jury found,
as a third aggravating factor, that the offense was "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel." '
Ibid. Since it needed only one aggravating circumstance to impose death, the state court held that "failure of one repetitious aggravating circumstance does not invalidate
the two remaining aggravating factors to reverse the death sencuit upheld this aspect of the Mississippi sentencing scheme against an equal
protection challenge. See also Adams v. Wainwright, 709 F. 2d 1443, 1447
(CAll 1983) (rejecting similar challenge to Florida statute on the basis of
Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976)), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1063 (1984).
On the other hand, the Eighth Circuit invalidated Arkansas' use of an aggravating circumstance (committed for pecuniary gain) because it repeated an
element of the underlying capital offense. Collins v. Lockhart, 754 F. 2d
258, 263-264, cert. denied, 474 U. S. 1013 (1985).
2A number of state courts have invalidated double counting of aggravating
circumstances. See, e. g., Cook v. State, 369 So. 2d 1251, 1256 (Ala. 1979);
Provence v. State, 337 So. 2d 783, 786 (Fla. 1976); State v. Rust, 197 Neb.
528, 537, 250 N. W. 2d 867, 873, cert. denied, 434 U. S. 912 (1977); Glidewell
v. State, 663 P. 2d 738, 743 (Okla. Crim. App. 1983).
Petitioner also challenges the application of this aggravating circumstance
as unconstitutionally vague under Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980).
Petitioner's crime was similar to that in Godfrey: the victim was shot twice
from close range, without warning, and died on the scene. 484 So. 2d, at
352-354. Although Mississippi has adopted a limiting construction of this
aggravating circumstance, in light of the facts of this case, I "doubt that
the trial judge's understanding and application of this aggravating circumstance conformed to that degree of certainty required by our decision in Godfrey . . . ." Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 109, n. 4 (1982).

tence." Id., at 351-352. But under the Mississippi capital sentencing statute, Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-103 (Supp. 1985), the
jury was instructed to balance aggravating against mitigating circumstances.
While the jury might have returned a verdict of
death even if there had been only one aggravating circumstance,
we cannot be sure that it would have done so in view of the mitigating factors presented; 4 the jury's verdict merely stated that
"'there are insufficient mitigating factors to outweigh the aggravating circumstances."' 484 So. 2d, at 342 (emphasis supplied).
Under the circumstances, I believe that the sentencer's "consideration of ... improper aggravating circumstance[s] so infects the
balancing process created by" the Mississippi statute "that it is
constitutionally impermissible ... to let the sentence stand." Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 956 (1983) (plurality opinion).5
A capital sentencing scheme that repeats an element of the underlying capital offense in two aggravating circumstances cannot
properly perform the narrowing function envisioned in Godfrey v.
Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), and Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.
862 (1983).
Since petitioner was sentenced under a scheme that
suffered from these deficiencies, I would grant the petition for
certiorari.6

1In Collins v. Lockhart, supra, at 258-259, the Eighth Circuit invalidated
an Arkansas death sentence after eliminating one of three aggravating circumstances found by the jury, since the jury had balanced aggravating and
mitigating factors. The Court of Appeals distinguished the Arkansas sentencing statute from statutes that give the jury absolute discretion to impose
death once it finds a single aggravating circumstance. But cf. Zant v. Stephens, supra, at 890.
6 In addition, petitioner raises issues related to those that will be before

In Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969), the Court held
that the valid arrest of a person in a residence does not give the
police an automatic right to search the remainder of the house
without a warrant. Some Courts of Appeals permit a warrantless
"protective sweep" of the remainder of the premises if the arresting officers reasonably believe that there are other persons on
the premises who could pose a danger to the officers' safety. See
United States v. Hatcher, 680 F. 2d 438, 444 (CA6 1982); United
States v. Kolodziej, 706 F. 2d 590, 596-597 (CA5 1983). Other
Courts of Appeals, including the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in this case, permit protective sweeps if there is a likelihood that another person may be on the premises who may destroy evidence. See also United States v. Vasquez, 638 F. 2d 507
(CA2 1980), cert. denied, 454 U. S. 975 (1981). Almost all of the
Courts of Appeals have struggled to define the circumstances
under which such searches are permissible. See United States v.
Gardner, 627 F. 2d 906, 910, n. 3 (CA9 1980).
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in this case expressly recognized that its approach, allowing a protective sweep
when the police only suspect that another person on the premises

may destroy evidence, conflicted with the more stringent safetybased approach adopted by other Courts of Appeals. 778 F. 2d
933, 937 (1985). In light of these differing approaches and in light
of the decision in Chimel v. California, see Vasquez v. United

This case presents the issue whether exhaustion of state administrative remeaies is a prerequisite to bringing an action in state
court under 42 U. S. C. § 1983.
In this case, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court held that state administrative remedies must be exhausted before bringing an action under § 1983 in Wisconsin state
courts. 128 Wis. 2d 404, 383 N. W. 2d 54 (1986). For the reasons
stated in my previous dissent from denial of certiorari in Caylor v.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins,
dissenting.
The respondents in this case first moved for prejudgment interest 30 days after the entry of judgment in their favor. The District Court treated the motion as one to alter or amend the judgment, and denied it as untimely because it was not filed within 10
days of the entry of judgment. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(e).
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that a motion for prejudgment interest made for
the first time after entry of judgment is not a Rule 59(e) motion
but a general motion governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
7. 785 F. 2d 720, 723 (1986). This holding conflicts with Goodman v. Heublein, Inc., 682 F. 2d 44, 45-47 (CA2 1982). I would
grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v.
Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).
However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless
would grant certiorari because petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel at his trial in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.
I
Petitioner Levis Leon Aldrich was charged with the murder of
Robert Ward, the night manager at a restaurant where Aldrich
had at one time been employed. Ward's body was discovered at
12:19 a.m. on September 3, 1974, by sheriff's deputies responding
to the restaurant's burglar alarm. Ward had been shot in the
head. The restaurant's safe had been emptied of the evening's
receipts, estimated by the owner at between $600 and $900. At
roughly 2 a.m., police stopped petitioner, who was driving his car
slowly by the restaurant. Petitioner was carrying more than
$500 in cash. At their request, petitioner took the police officers
to the hotel room in which he had been staying since his release
from prison the week before. There he showed the officers his
receipt for $558.58 paid to him by the Department of Corrections
at the time of his release.
The shotgun which had killed Ward was later discovered by the
police, broken apart, in two ditches in the surrounding neighborhood. No physical evidence at the crime scene or on the shotgun
linked petitioner to the killing. However, after further investigation, petitioner was arrested and indicted.
Aldrich was represented by appointed counsel from the Public
Defender's office. The only member of that office who conducted
any investigation or undertook any preparation for the trial until
two weeks before the trial date was a legal intern in the office,
who during the relevant period was not yet a member of the bar.
Trial counsel did not exercise the right, under Florida law, to depose any of the State's 41 prospective witnesses. No one from
the Public Defender's office examined any of the State's physical
exhibits. Of the seven prospective witnesses identified by the defense before trial, petitioner's counsel had interviewed only two.
Pet. for Cert. 12.

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

479 U. S.

Four days before the opening of trial, petitioner's counsel
moved for a continuance. The motion was heard on the scheduled
trial date, at which time defense counsel told the court: "This case
is not prepared. We are not in a position to provide competent
legal representation." Id., at 11. The trial court denied the motion and insisted that the trial begin immediately. Petitioner's
trial counsel, who was fully experienced in the trial of capital
cases, testified in the state postconviction hearing that he had
never been as unprepared to try even a misdemeanor case as he
was for petitioner's capital murder trial. Ibid.
The State's case hinged upon the testimony of Charles Strickland. Strickland owned the shotgun which had killed Ward; he
told police that he had lent it to petitioner on the evening of the
murder. Strickland claimed that petitioner called him the next
day and told him that he had used the gun in a robbery and had
killed a man. According to Strickland, petitioner asked him to
help recover the gun from a parking lot near the scene of the murder. Strickland testified that he did so, after which he cleaned
the gun, broke it down, and threw the parts into separate ditches.
Although Strickland initially told police that he had lost the gun,
he later changed his mind and led police to the evidence. James
Norman Sapp, who along with Strickland had met petitioner in
prison, testified that while in prison petitioner had told Sapp that
he intended to rob the restaurant when released.
The sole defense witness was petitioner himself, who denied any
involvement in the crime. He testified that he had been fishing
until 10:30 or 11 p.m. on the night of the murder, and had then
gone to a bar until 1:30 or 2 a.m. After leaving the bar, petitioner testified, he drove out to meet a woman who had a room to
rent. On the way to her house, he passed the restaurant, and
was stopped by the police.
The jury found petitioner guilty of capital murder. At petitioner's express request, counsel presented no evidence in mitigation of sentence. The jury returned an advisory verdict in favor
of the death sentence, which the trial court then imposed. The
Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death
sentence. Aldridge v. State, 351 So. 2d 942 (1977).*

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

(1982), cert. denied, 461 U. S. 939 (1983). In his first federal
habeas petition, Aldrich claimed that he had been denied effective
assistance of counsel at his trial. The District Court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. 777 F. 2d 630 (CAll
1985).
II
The District Court found, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that
petitioner's trial counsel was so handicapped by absence of preparation that he could not meet the objective standard of reasonably
effective assistance of counsel required by this Court in Strickland
v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). The Court of Appeals held,
however, that petitioner had failed to show that he was prejudiced
by the inadequacy of his counsel, as required by Strickland,
supra. The Court of Appeals found that further investigation before trial would not have disclosed helpful evidence: "On crossexamination at the post-conviction hearing, [counsel] who represented Aldrich at trial were unable to point to any fact learned
at trial, or later, that might have been discovered by deposition."
777 F. 2d, at 637. In response to the statement of counsel that
investigation would have shown that Strickland and Sapp had a
motive to commit the robbery, and additionally had reasons to
throw suspicion on petitioner, the Court of Appeals found this "insufficient to [create] 'a reasonable probability' of reasonable doubt
respecting guilt." Id., at 636.
III
I continue to believe that "a showing that the performance of
a defendant's lawyer departed from constitutionally prescribed
standards requires a new trial regardless of whether the defendant suffered demonstrable prejudice thereby." Strickland, 466
U. S., at 712 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Even under the prejudice standard, however, the facts disclosed by the record demonstrate that petitioner is entitled to relief. As the Court recognized in fashioning the prejudice standard, "a verdict or conclusion
only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been
affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support."
Id., at 696. The dissent in the Court of Appeals correctly characterized this case:
"Petitioner was convicted on the basis of evidence that was
far from strong. No physical evidence implicating Aldrich was

OCTOBER TERM, 1986

479 U. S.

recovered at the scene of the killing. While in custody, Aldrich made no statements resembling a confession. The only
direct evidence implicating Aldrich was testimony from a convicted felon who had violated the terms of his parole and lied to
police investigators, and who was the other most likely suspect
in the crime." 777 F. 2d, at 642 (Johnson, J., dissenting).
Petitioner's life rested on the outcome of the jury's estimation
of the relative credibility of petitioner and Charles Strickland.
Yet because of the absence of preparation time, petitioner's counsel had not interviewed the witnesses whose testimony might bear
on the credibility of Strickland's story. Even more importantly,
counsel had not exercised his state-law right to take Strickland's
deposition. "The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper
functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result." Strickland, supra, at
686. In a case as closely balanced as this one, I believe we can
have no confidence in the result where counsel's inadequate preparation precluded the vigorous testing of the evidence upon which
the State proposed to forfeit a man's life.
I would grant the petition for certiorari.

this provision. 788 F. 2d 1361 (1986). For the reasons stated in

dissenting.
This case presents the question of which state statute of limitations should be applied in a case brought under 42 U. S. C. § 1983
when more than one state statute arguably can be characterized
as addressing "personal injury" claims. See Wilson v. Garcia,
471 U. S.261 (1985). The lower courts continue to struggle with
this question. In this case, for example, the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit, 754 F. 2d 662 (1985), concluded that a 3-year,
catchall statute should be applied which covers actions brought "to
recover damages for the death of a person, or for injury to a person or property." Mich. Comp. Laws § 600.5805(8) (1979). The
Sixth Circuit chose this section over other 2-year sections which
specifically cover intentional torts. See, e. g., Mich. Comp. Laws
§ 600.5805(2) (1979) ("The period of limitations is 2 years for an

OCTOBER TERM, 1986

action charging assault, battery, or false imprisonment.") In so
deciding, the Sixth Circuit has taken an approach directly contrary to its earlier decision in Mulligan v. Hazard, 777 F. 2d 340,
344 (1985), cert. denied, 476 U. S. 1174 (1986).
I dissented from the denial of certiorari in Mulligan because of
the split among the Courts of Appeals in dealing with this question, and I dissent here because the confusion evidenced by this
split is underscored by the Sixth Circuit's change in approach.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR, concurring.

I write briefly in support of the Court's denial of the petition
for certiorari in this case, and to respond to JUSTICE BRENNAN'S
suggestion that the limits on the prosecutor's right to peremptorily challenge jurors found in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79

ORDERS

O'CONNOR,

J., concurring

(1986), apply outside the context of racial discrimination forbidden
by the Equal Protection Clause. Batson does not touch, indeed,
it clearly reaffirms, id., at 89, the ordinary rule that a prosecutor
may exercise his peremptory strikes for any reason at all.
Batson, in my view, depends upon this Nation's profound commitment to the ideal of racial equality, a commitment that refuses to
permit the State to act on the premise that racial differences matter. It is central to Batson that a "person's race simply 'is unrelated to his fitness as a juror."' Id., at 87 (citation omitted).
There is no basis for declaring that a juror's attitudes towards
the death penalty are similarly irrelevant to the outcome of a capital sentencing proceeding. Indeed, Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391
U. S. 510 (1968), upon which JUSTICE BRENNAN'S dissent so
heavily relies, itself recognizes the relevance of this attitudinal
factor. Categorical exclusion of jurors with moral qualms over
capital punishment is forbidden precisely because such a practice
would produce "a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to
die." Id., at 521.
Moreover, JUSTICE BRENNAN's dissent ignores a fundamental
distinction between peremptory challenges of jurors and challenges for cause. Challenges for cause permit the categorical and
unlimited exclusion of jurors exhibiting an inability to serve fairly
and impartially in the case to be tried, as noted in Wainwright v.
Witt, 469 U. S. 412 (1985). In Witherspoon, the Court held that
the Constitution does not tolerate such a categorical exclusion of
jurors who merely express moral scruples about or general objections to capital punishment unless it would "'prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance
with his instructions and his oath."' Wainwright v. Witt, supra,
at 424 (citation omitted).
Peremptory challenges are limited in number. Each party, the
prosecutor, and the defense counsel, must balance a host of considerations in deciding which jurors should be peremptorily excused. Permitting prosecutors to take into account the concerns
expressed about capital punishment by prospective jurors, or any
other factor, in exercising peremptory challenges simply does not
implicate the concerns expressed in Witherspoon.
We ought not delude ourselves that the deep faith that race
should never be relevant has completely triumphed over the painful social reality that, sometimes, it may be. That the Court will
not tolerate prosecutors' racially discriminatory use of the pe-

remptory challenge, in effect, is a special rule of relevance, a
statement about what this Nation stands for, rather than a statement of fact. In my view, that special rule is a product of the
unique history of racial discrimination in this country; it should
not be divorced from that context. Outside the uniquely sensitive
area of race the ordinary rule that a prosecutor may strike a juror
without giving any reason applies. Because a juror's attitudes towards the death penalty may be relevant to how the juror judges,
while, as a matter of law, his race is not, this case is not like
Batson.
JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins,
dissenting.
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the decision below insofar as it left undisturbed the death sentence imposed in this case.
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 227 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could be
imposed constitutionally under certain circumstances, I nevertheless would grant certiorari because the petitioner presents strong
evidence that the State used its peremptory challenges in this case
to exclude jurors that it was forbidden to excuse for cause under
Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 (1968).
In Witherspoon, this Court held that, in a capital case, the prosecution may not exclude for cause those jurors who indicate that
they have scruples about the death penalty, but who nonetheless
state that such beliefs would not prevent them from performing
their duties as jurors according to law. Exclusion of such jurors,
we said, denies a capital defendant the right to sentencing by an
impartial jury that is representative of the community, for it "produce[s] a jury uncommonly willing to condemn a man to die." Id.,
at 521. We underscored the importance of this right in Adams v.
Texas, 448 U. S. 38 (1980), which held unconstitutional the exclusion of jurors who acknowledged that their concerns about capital
punishment might affect their ability to find facts that would lead
to its automatic imposition. Texas could not, we said, bar jurors
who stated that they would honestly find the relevant facts if convinced of their existence beyond a reasonable doubt,
"yet who frankly concede that the prospects of the death penalty may affect what their honest judgment of the facts will

ORDERS
940

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

be or what they may deem to be a reasonable doubt. Such
assessments and judgments by jurors are inherent in the jury
system, and to exclude all jurors who would be in the slightest way affected by the prospect of the death penalty or by
their views about such a penalty would be to deprive the defendant of the impartial jury to which he or she is entitled
under the law." Id., at 50.
The petitioner in the case before us, David J. Brown, was convicted of the first-degree murder of two women and given two
death sentences. At voir dire, the prosecutor had sought to determine not merely if prospective jurors had any scruples about
the death penalty that might impair their performance, but if they
had any scruples about it at all. The prosecutor was remarkably
candid about this objective in addressing the venire at the start of
voir dire:
"'We want to know if you do in fact believe in capital punishment, not wavering. We want to know at the outset, that is
when we approve you as a juror, if we do, that you surely do
believe in capital punishment in some cases, and that you can,
if necessary, make a decision that would involve capital punishment."' Pet. for Cert. 10.
As the voir dire reveals, the prosecutor diligently pursued his
goal of seating only those jurors rigidly committed to the death
penalty:
"Q.: Mr. Caldwell, how do you feel about capital punishment?
Are you for it or against it?
"A.: I am for it.
"Q.: I didn't understand you.
"A.: I said I'm for it.
"Q.: How long have [you] been in favor of capital punishment
in some cases, Mr. Caldwell?
"A.: All my life, every time I hear tale of something like that,
about all my life, I guess.
"Q.: That's what I wanted to hear, Mr. Caldwell.
"Q.: Mrs. Pope, do you know your mind to the extent of saying whether or not you believe in capital punishment?
"A.: I do.
"Q.: Have all of your adult life?

479 U. S.

"A.: Yes, sir.

"Q.: And if ultimately you are called upon after a proper instruction by the Judge to carefully consider what should happen to, to determine life or death, that wouldn't bother you
unduly, will it?
"A.: No, sir." Id., at 7, 9-10.
In another exchange, after juror Williams stated that he believed
in capital punishment, the prosecutor continued to question him to
establish that he had the "'strength and fortitude"' to render a
death verdict "without 'any doubt."' Id., at 10.
Those jurors who indicated the slightest uncertainty about the
death penalty were excused by peremptory challenge, without inquiry into whether their convictions would render them incapable
of performing their duties as jurors:

"Q.: Mrs. Beaver, having sat here for some several minutes
in this courtroom today, you know what we are here for?
"A.: Yes.
"Q.: Having thoughts about capital punishment, at least I
would assume here today, and no doubt having thought about
it in the past, do you know your mind about that question?
"A.: I'm afraid I don't.
"Q.: Afraid you don't?
"A.: No.
"[Prosecutor:] The State will excuse Mrs. Beaver with our
thanks." Id., at 9.
The State concedes that it could not have excused for cause
those jurors failing the prosecutor's litmus test. It maintains,
however, that since it used peremptory challenges to accomplish
this end, its conduct is immune from scrutiny. The State reads
our recent decision in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), as
significant only in that it proscribes racially discriminatory peremptory challenges. It insists that, since the challenges were exercised in this case in a racially neutral manner, they are free from
constitutional infirmity.
The implication of the State's position is that it is free to use
its peremptory challenges to violate any constitutional command
other than the Equal Protection Clause. The State, however,
misses the wider significance of Batson: that the broad discretion

ORDERS
940

BRENNAN,

J., dissenting

afforded prosecutors in the exercise of peremptory challenges may
not be abused to accomplish any unconstitutional end. In Batson, we said that "counsel's effort to obtain possibly relevant information about prospective jurors is to be distinguished from the
practice at issue here." Id., at 89, n. 12 (emphasis added).
JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S concurrence observes that, as an unfortunate matter of fact, race may be relevant in that it may actually
influence a juror's decision. The concurrence correctly notes that
such factual relevance is insufficient to justify the exercise of a
peremptory challenge on the basis of a juror's race, because race
has been deemed irrelevant as a matter of law. The concurrence,
however, fails to recognize that precisely the same situation obtains
with respect to scruples about the death penalty. Such scruples
may be relevant as a matter of fact. Nonetheless, that is insufficient to justify the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors
with such scruples, for Witherspoon and Adams make clear that
this characteristic is irrelevant as a matter of law. It does not
minimize the tragic history of race discrimination in this country to
insist that we enforce the Witherspoon proscription just as faithfully as that forbidding reliance on race, for we may not pick and
choose which constitutional rights we will and will not vindicate in
monitoring the jury selection process.
Peremptory challenges may be used for reasons that may not
comport completely with rational analysis, or that may resist coherent articulation. Such latitude has for practical reasons required a
presumption that these challenges are exercised in a constitutionally responsible fashion. As Batson makes clear, however, that
presumption is rebuttable. In this case, the Court is presented
with evidence from the voir dire that plainly indicates that the prosecutor used his peremptory challenges to obtain the "hanging jury,"
Witherspoon, 391 U. S., at 523, that he could not obtain through
challenges for cause. We therefore cannot maintain the usual presumption that these challenges were properly used.
Agents of the State enjoy considerable discretion in performing
certain functions within the criminal justice system. With great
discretion, however, comes great responsibility. When a court
has evidence that the State has not lived up to that responsibility,
its refusal to intervene converts discretion into a license for constitutional violation. For this reason, I would grant the petition
for certiorari in this case.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins,
dissenting.
In this case the trial court admitted, over petitioner's objection,
the testimony of a purported expert on blood spatter techniques.
On appeal, the Court of Military Appeals held that the testimony
in question was admissible under Military Rule of Evidence 702,
which is worded identically to Federal Rule of Evidence 702. The
court held that the so-called Frye test for determining the admissibility of expert testimony, see Frye v. United States, 54
App. D. C. 46, 47, 293 F. 1013, 1014 (1923), was superseded by
the 1975 enactment of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The court
described Military Rule 702 as establishing a much lower threshold than Frye for determining whether a given person is an expert. This conclusion is supported by decisions interpreting Federal Rule of Evidence 702 as establishing a more flexible standard
of admissibility than the Frye test. See, e. g., United States v.
Downing, 753 F. 2d 1224 (CA3 1985). Other courts, however,
have interpreted Federal Rule of Evidence 702 as incorporating
the Frye test. Barrel of Fun, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 739 F. 2d 1028, 1031, n. 9 (CA5 1984); United States v.
McBride, 786 F. 2d 45, 49 (CA2 1986). I would grant certiorari
to resolve this conflict on an obviously recurring and important
issue.

No. 86-5211. REED v. UNITED STATES. C. A. 2d Cir. Certiorari denied. Reported below: 790 F. 2d 208.
dissenting.
In this case, the District Court permitted a 13th, alternate juror
to participate in the jury's deliberations, a procedure to which
petitioner's counsel stipulated. The 13 jurors unanimously found
petitioner guilty. On appeal, petitioner argued that the use of a
13-member jury violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(c),
that the Rule is not waivable, and that even if it is, it can only
be waived by a defendant personally and not by counsel. The
Court of Appeals held that petitioner, through his counsel, had
waived compliance with Rule 24(c). It concluded that "[b]ecause
the waiver herein was neither prejudicial nor of constitutional magnitude and was made in the presence of the defendant in open court,
...the failure to obtain appellant's personal assent. . . , [if erroneous,] was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." 790 F. 2d 208,211
(CA2 1986). This decision conflicts with United States v. Virginia
Erection Corp., 335 F. 2d 868, 870 (CA4 1964), which requires a
defendant's express and personal waiver of Rule 24(c), assuming
that the Rule can be waived at all. See also United States v.
Chatman, 584 F. 2d 1358 (CA4 1978) (explaining Virginia Erection
as establishing a per se rule of plain error in cases where Rule 24(c)
is violated without obtaining a defendant's personal consent);
United States v. Beasley, 464 F. 2d 468 (CA10 1972) (holding, in a
case not involving an issue of waiver, that violations of Rule 24(c)
are reversible per se, and approving the result in Virginia Erection). I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

dissenting.
Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

and Fourteenth Amendments, I would vacate the judgment of the
Florida Supreme Court insofar as it left undisturbed the death
sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). Even if I believed, however, that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed
under certain circumstances, petitioner's youth and mental condition preclude imposition of a sentence of death under the requirements of the Eighth Amendment.
Petitioner Ronald Woods was convicted of first-degree murder
and sentenced to death in connection with the stabbing of a guard
at the Union Correctional Institution, at which Woods was an inmate. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence. 490 So. 2d 24 (1986). Woods was 18
years old at the time of his trial. Id., at 28, n. 7. The evidence
submitted to the trial court in mitigation of sentence showed that
petitioner had suffered seizures in childhood, and had sustained
brain damage. Pet. for Cert. 20. Petitioner's IQ is reported to
be below 73, within the borderline range of mental retardation.
Ibid.
I believe that the imposition of capital punishment for crimes
committed by juveniles is unconstitutionally cruel punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. "Although '[c]rimes committed by youths may be just as harmful to victims as those committed by older persons, .

.

. they deserve less punishment because

adolescents may have less capacity to control their conduct and
to think in long-range terms than adults."' Roach v. Aiken, 474
U. S. 1039 (1986) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting) (quoting Twentieth
Century Fund Task Force on Sentencing Policy Toward Young
Offenders, Confronting Youth Crime 7 (1978)); see also Eddings v.
Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 115-116 (1982). These considerations
are particularly compelling where, as here, the offender's mental
capacities are organically impaired. While the trial court treated
petitioner's youth as a mitigating circumstance, it did not consider
whether petitioner's mental retardation, or the combination of his
youth and mental incapacity, presented a circumstance that might
foreclose application of the death penalty.
The execution of a mentally retarded child in retribution for a
crime committed at or before the age of 18 cannot, in my judgment, be reconciled with the requirements of the Eighth Amendment, or with our fundamental commitment to the preservation of
human rights. I would grant the petition for certiorari.

dissenting.
In view of the presence in the courtroom throughout the trial
of a substantial number of uniformed guards (up to as many as 45)
and the trial court's denial of petitioner's request to clear the
courtroom of uniformed spectators, and the failure of the Supreme
Court of Florida in its opinion, see 490 So. 2d 24, 26-27 (1986),
even to cite this Court's then recent decision in Holbrook v.
Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 (1986), I would grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case to the
Supreme Court of Florida for reconsideration in light of Holbrook.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN,

Certiorari denied.

Reported below: 786

with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,

dissenting.
This case concerns an application of the "separate document" requirement for judgments contained in Rule 58 of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure.' I dissent from the denial of certiorari
because I am persuaded that the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit misconstrued our prior cases having to do
with the requirement.
Petitioner Amoco Oil Co. took an appeal from an order issued
by the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.
On May 21, 1985, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy
Court's ruling by a memorandum and order consisting of a single
document. Petitioner moved for reconsideration. The motion
was denied on June 28 in a similar single-document memorandum
and order.2
On July 25, 1985, Amoco filed a notice of appeal with the Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. That court issued an order directing Amoco to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed. It suggested that, because the District Court had issued
'Rule 58 reads in its entirety:
"Subject to the provisions of Rule 54(b): (1) upon a general verdict of a jury,
or upon a decision by the court that a party shall recover only a sum certain
or costs or that all relief shall be denied, the clerk, unless the court otherwise
orders, shall forthwith prepare, sign, and enter the judgment without awaiting any direction by the court; (2) upon a decision by the court granting other
relief, or upon a special verdict or a general verdict accompanied by answers
to interrogatories, the court shall promptly approve the form of the judgment,
and the clerk shall thereupon enter it. Every judgment shall be set forth on
a separate document. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and
when entered as provided in Rule 79(a). Entry of the judgment shall not be
delayed for taxing of costs. Attorneys shall not submit forms of judgment
except upon direction of the court, and these directions shall not be given as a
matter of course." (Emphasis supplied.)
'Inasmuch as the motion for reconsideration was untimely, it is not clear
why the District Court entertained it. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 59(e). In
any event, because of its untimeliness, the motion would not have tolled the
time for Amoco's appeal had there been no Rule 58 problem with the District
Court's original memorandum opinion and order. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.
4(a)(4).

BLACKMUN,

J., dissenting

its initial memorandum opinion and order on May 21, Amoco's filing would be 35 days late under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 4(a) and 26(a). App. to Pet. for Cert. C-1. In response,
Amoco contended that, rather than being untimely, its appeal actually was premature, given that the District Court had never
entered a judgment separate from the May 21 memorandum and
order as Rule 58 requires. The Court of Appeals rejected this
contention. It observed that in Bankers Trust Co. v. Matis, 435
U. S. 381 (1978) (per curiam), this Court had adopted a commonsense, rather than a technical, approach to the requirements of
Rule 58 so long as no party was misled. App. to Pet. for Cert.
D-1. The Court of Appeals further noted that Amoco's motion
for reconsideration of the May 21 memorandum and order demonstrated that Amoco considered that opinion to be the final decision. Accordingly, the court concluded: "The mere technicality
that the district court failed to file a separate judgment should not
be used to give jurisdiction to this Court of an untimely filed appeal in which the parties were not misled by the lack of a separate
judgment." Id., at D-1 to D-2.
Rule 58 provides in pertinent part: "Every judgment shall be
set forth on a separate document." See n. 1, supra. The genesis
and purpose of this "separate document" requirement, which was
added to Rule 58 by amendment in 1963, are explained in the Advisory Committee Notes. Prior to the amendment difficulties had
arisen in situations where a court had "written an opinion or
memorandum containing some apparently directive or dispositive
words, e. g., 'the plaintiff's motion [for summary judgment] is
granted."' 28 U. S. C. App., p. 627. At times court clerks had
viewed these documents as a sufficient basis for entering a judgment. Problems occasionally arose, however, when the documents did not provide all the necessary elements of the judgment
or when the court later would issue a formal judgment. Parties
were thus uncertain as to when the judgment was effective and as
to when the time began to run for purposes of filing postjudgment
motions and appeals. The Advisory Committee observed: "The
amended rule eliminates these uncertainties by requiring that
there be a judgment set out on a separate document -distinct
from any opinion or memorandum-which provides the basis for
the entry of judgment." Id., at 628.
This Court already has been concerned with the interpretation
of Rule 58. In United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U. S. 216 (1973)

(per curiam), it was faced with a situation where, although a
docket entry had been made on March 21, 1969, which noted jury
verdicts in favor of respondent and another against the Government, the formal judgment specifying the amount of the verdicts
was not entered until February 25, 1971. The Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit dismissed the Government's appeal, filed
after the 1971 entry, as untimely. This Court reviewed the history of the 1963 amendment to Rule 58 and cited with approval
Professor Moore's remark that the Rule constituted "'a mechanical change that would be subject to criticism for its formalism
were it not for the fact that something like this was needed to
make certain when a judgment becomes effective.'" Id., at 220
(quoting 6A J. Moore, Federal Practice § 58.04[4.-2], p. 58-161
(1972)). It also concluded that the appeal taken and abandoned
by the Government during the time between the docketing of the
jury verdict and the entry of judgment was not an appropriate
part of the Rule 58 inquiry. It noted simply that "whatever may
be the appropriate sanctions available in a particular case for capricious conduct on the part of a litigant, we do not believe that a
case-by-case tailoring of the 'separate document' provision of Rule
58 is one of them." 411 U. S., at 221. Accordingly, it concluded
that the mechanical application of Rule 58, as advocated by Professor Moore, was appropriate and required reversal of the Court
of Appeals' judgment.
In Bankers Trust, supra, the Court returned to the separatedocument matter. There the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit had proceeded to a consideration of the merits of an appeal
even though it could find no document appearing to be a judgment
of the District Court. See id., at 382. The Court of Appeals
based its decision on the fact that the District Court and the
parties assumed that the dismissal had been adjudicated. Ibid.
We approved that conclusion. We first observed that the major
purpose behind the separate-document requirement was to clarify
when the time for an appeal begins to run. Citing the remarks of
the Advisory Committee mentioned above, we further noted that
the separate-document requirement was aimed particularly at
"avoid[ing] the inequities that were inherent when a party appealed from a document or docket entry that appeared to be a
final judgment of the district court only to have the appellate
court announce later that an earlier document or entry had been
the judgment and dismiss the appeal as untimely." Id., at 385.

We could not see, however, how the purpose of Rule 58 or the
concerns of the Advisory Committee would be served in that case
by depriving the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction because of the
absence of a separate document. If the court were to lose jurisdiction for this reason, then "[u]pon dismissal, the district court
would simply file and enter the separate judgment, from which a
timely appeal would then be taken. Wheels would spin for no
practical purpose."
Ibid. While observing that "It]echnical
application" of Rule 58 would be necessary in a situation similar
to the one in Indrelunas to avoid a party's uncertainty as to when
to bring an appeal, we concluded that the rule "should not prevent the parties from waiving the separate-judgment requirement
where one has accidentally not been entered." 435 U. S., at 386.
In this respect, we cited another remark of Professor Moore: "'[I]t
must be remembered that the rule is designed to simplify and
make certain the matter of appealability. It is not designed as
a trap for the inexperienced .... The rule should be interpreted to
prevent loss of the right of appeal, not to facilitate loss."' Ibid.
(quoting 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice 110.0812], pp. 119-120
(1970)).
These two decisions, I believe, are to be read to support the following proposition: the separate-document requirement must be
applied mechanically in order to protect a party's right of appeal,
although parties may waive this requirement in order to maintain
appellate jurisdiction of their case. Cf. 6A J. Moore, J. Lucas, &
G. Grotheer, Moore's Federal Practice 58.02.1, p. 58-22 (2d ed.
1986). The fundamental error of the Court of Appeals in this
case, therefore, was to employ Amoco's purported waiver to defeat its appeal. Amoco's filing for reconsideration might well
have signaled its recognition that the May 21 order was indeed the
final judgment. As the Court made clear in Indrelunas, however, while relevant to the question of sanctions, a party's conduct
is irrelevant to the application of Rule 58 unless it serves to maintain the right of appeal. Given that a finding of waiver in this
case results in Amoco's loss of its right of appeal, then, under our
earlier decisions in Indrelunas and Bankers Trust, Rule 58 should
have been applied mechanically. The Court of Appeals should
have dismissed the purported appeal and directed the District
Court to enter a final judgment, from which a proper appeal could
lie. Accordingly, I would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE O'CONNOR joins,
dissenting.
This Court, in McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210 (1981), held
that federal law precludes a state court from dividing military retired pay pursuant to state community property laws. Congress,
concerned with the effect our holding would have on the divorced
spouses of retired military personnel, enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouse's Protection Act (USFSPA), Pub. L. 97-252,
96 Stat. 730, 10 U. S. C. § 1408. That Act, in effect, nullified our
decision in McCarty and permitted States to treat military retired
pay as either the property of the military member or as property of
both the member and his spouse. California enacted 1983 Cal.
Stats., ch. 775, Cal. Civ. Code Ann. § 5124 (West) (effective up to
January 1, 1986). In so doing, the California Legislature declared
that California would return to its pre-McCartypractice of treating
military retired pay as community property.
This case presents the question whether USFSPA is to be given
retroactive effect. In other words, is that Act to be read to permit spouses, whose divorce decrees were made final after our decision in McCarty but before USFSPA was enacted, to set aside
that part of their divorce decrees denying them a share in a military pension because of our holding in McCarty. Petitioner in
this case attempted to set aside her divorce decree which became
final during the period of time between our decision in McCarty
and enactment of USFSPA. The California Court of Appeal held
that USFSPA is not to be given retroactive effect. Other state
courts which have considered this question have come to a differ-

In this case the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that
certain provisions of the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law (WPCL), Pa. Stat. Ann., Title 43, § 260.1 et seq. (Purdon
1964 and Supp. 1986), were pre-empted by § 514(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat.
897, 29 U. S. C. § 1144(a). 794 F. 2d 100 (1986). The WPCL authorizes an employee to sue his or her employer for wages, fringe
benefits, and pension plan contributions. The Court of Appeals
reasoned that these provisions could not withstand the preemptive sweep of § 514(a), inasmuch as ERISA establishes a comprehensive mechanism for the recovery of delinquent pension plan
contributions, and the petitioner-employees in this case were attempting to avoid this mechanism and "substitute instead a state
regulation that circumvents the scheme carefully devised by Congress." 794 F. 2d, at 107. This holding conflicts with the decision in Sasso v. Vachris, 66 N. Y. 2d 28, 484 N. E. 2d 1359
(1985). In that case, the Court of Appeals of the State of New
York held that § 514(a) did not pre-empt N. Y. Bus. Corp. Law
§ 630 (McKinney 1986), which imposes personal liability upon the
10 largest shareholders of a closely held New York corporation for
the payment of pension fund contributions owed its employees.
Observing that ERISA also contained remedial provisions for the
collection of delinquent contributions, the Sasso court stated that
these remedies "merely supplement, rather than supersede, existing State remedies . . . ." 66 N. Y. 2d, at 36, 484 N. E. 2d,
at 1364. I would grant the petition for certiorari to resolve this
conflict.

Adhering to my view that the death penalty is under all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth

Florida Supreme Court insofar as it left undisturbed the death
sentence imposed in this case. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
231 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting). However, even if I believed that the death penalty could constitutionally be imposed
under certain circumstances, I would nevertheless grant certiorari
because petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance
of counsel required that he be given access to his trial counsel's
work files for use in his state habeas corpus hearing in which
he alleged that trial counsel's representation was constitutionally
deficient.

lowing the issuance of a death warrant, petitioner sought habeas
corpus relief in state court. After a hearing, the habeas petition
was denied; the Supreme Court of Florida again affirmed. Maxwell v. Wainwright, 490 So. 2d 927 (1986).
The petition stated a claim for ineffective assistance of trial
counsel, challenging counsel's failure to make certain motions and
objections in the course of petitioner's defense. The habeas petition also alleged that trial counsel, engaged in his first attempt
to defend a client on capital charges, inadequately investigated
petitioner's background in preparation for the penalty phase of the
trial. Id., at 932-933.
Prior to the hearing, petitioner's trial counsel refused habeas
counsel's informal request to produce work files pertaining to petitioner's defense. Time constraints did not permit habeas counsel
to subpoena these materials before filing petitioner's motion for
habeas corpus relief.1 When the trial attorney testified at the
hearing, he admitted denying access to the requested files and
again refused production. He offered this justification for his
refusal:
"It is my reason and belief that ... if I'm going to divulge
or reveal or to allow people to inspect my files it should be
done by court order from either side and the reason for that
belief is that I think and believe wholeheartedly that if an
attorney who's a trial attorney is preparing his case for trial
that if its going to be subject to review a couple of years later
it may put a chilling effect on an attorney making notes or
work product or whatever have you.
"In other words, that attorney may not be as free to express
himself within his own confines of his file and, consequently,
until a court orders me to do so and that's determined to be a
lawful order, I have refused permission to turn it over to you."
App. to Brief in Opposition 19-20.
Habeas counsel then moved to compel production of the trial attorney's entire file. The state court denied this motion "based upon
[trial counsel's] rationale." Id., at 20.
Without the file, petitioner was unable to demonstrate the alleged deficiency of trial counsel's representation, particularly with
respect to his preparation for the penalty phase of petitioner's trial.
IHabeas counsel agreed to represent petitioner on October 30, 1984.

The

State of Florida had scheduled petitioner's execution for November 7, 1984.

This was due in large part to the attorney's apparent inability

"Q. Did you obtain a release from Mr. Maxwell to try to
take a look at any of [the State's] records?
"A. I don't have any recollection of that.

"A. You're asking hypothetical questions and I don't know.
I make notations on actions that I take in a great majority of

me to answer that.
"Q. Something like a release of medical information?
"A. That should be in the file.
"Q. Did you try to obtain or review any of Mr. Maxwell's
medical records?
"A. I have no recollection of that." Id., at 27-28.
"Q. Other than the motions and memoranda you filed in the
court file to the penalty phase, did you prepare any internal
memorandum regarding the application of the aggravating
and mitigating circumstances to this case?
"A. I had a lot of law or some law-the word 'a lot' is relative-into that case and whether I dictated memorandums or
not, I don't remember. If I have them, I have them. If I

or priest or a clergyman in that area or not. I don't specifically remember although it's possible.
"You have to remember it's three years I have not looked
at that file and there's just things I don't remember because
of the multitude of things that have happened since then.
"Q. I understand. If we had the file, would we be able to
find out the answers to some of these questions?
"A. I'm afraid not. In some areas, yes, in some areas, no,
because I don't make extensive notes on what I don't do.
What I do is make notes on what I do do. And when you're
coming from a negative position, I will not necessarily have
notes to protect myself. More or less, I don't prepare a case
to protect myself.
"So I may not have those kinds of notes. I would have
notes as to what I did do." Id., at 44-45.
On appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, petitioner argued that
the denial of his requests for access to his trial attorney's files
had impaired his due process right to a full and fair evidentiary
hearing on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court
rejected this argument with no substantive discussion, holding simply that "the hearing on the motion comported with due process
principles." 490 So. 2d, at 932.
II
An essential element of our society's protection of citizens accused of crime is the right to effective assistance of counsel.
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). "Counsel is provided to assist the
defendant in presenting his defense, but in order to do so effectively the attorney must work closely with the defendant in formulating defense strategy.... Moreover, counsel is likely to have to
make a number of crucial decisions throughout the proceedings on a
range of subjects that may require consultation with the defendant.
These decisions can best be made, and counsel's duties most effectively discharged, if the attorney and the defendant have a relationship characterized by trust and confidence." Morris v. Slappy,
461 U. S.1, 21 (1983) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in result). Counsel's duty to maintain this trust and confidence extends beyond the
trial itself. Though he may not continue to represent the defendant following conviction and the disposition of post-trial motions,

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

479 U. S.

he must nevertheless cooperate with defendant's attempts to challenge the conviction or sentence, especially if he possesses unique
information about a claim the defendant seeks to raise. Use of this
information may be the decisive factor in determining the defendant's failure or success on direct or collateral review.
A defendant's interest in the information in his trial counsel's
exclusive possession is of even greater significance when the defendant alleges ineffective assistance by trial counsel. Providing
access to such information unquestionably advances the inquiry this
Court identified in Strickland v. Washington, supra, at 689, as
essential to determining whether counsel has rendered ineffective
assistance: "A fair assessment of attorney performance requires
that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of
hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged
conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at
the time." There is no more accurate or reliable evidence of trial
counsel's actual perspective and extent of preparation than the contents of his client's case file. Access to these materials is critical
where, as here, trial counsel's testimony rests on little more than
vague recollections. Indeed, with respect to petitioner's allegation
that his trial attorney did not adequately prepare for the sentencing
proceeding, petitioner's need for access to the work files is of paramount importance. Denying access to what may be the most relevant evidence of the adequacy of legal representation is, in this respect, "fundamentally incompatible with the Eighth Amendment's
heightened 'need for reliability in the determination that death is
the appropriate punishment . . . ."'
Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472
U. S. 320, 340 (1985) (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428
U. S. 280, 305 (1976)).
The courts below erred, in violation of petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights, in accepting trial counsel's reasons for withholding
petitioner's files. 2 The right to effective assistance fully encom2To

the extent the Florida courts accepted trial counsel's suggested work-

product doctrine, their rulings vastly misconstrue this doctrine's underlying
purpose; the privilege to withhold an attorney's work product belongs to the
client, and in this case petitioner seeks access to files retained by his oun
attorney. Cf. Spivey v. Zant, 683 F. 2d 881, 885 (CA5 1982) (interpreting
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3)). The attorney's asserted need to
ensure that he is "free to express himself" within the confines of a written file
is likewise without merit. He seems to claim that if his recorded thoughts
are not protected from discovery, he will be less likely to inform himself and

passes the client's right to obtain from trial counsel the work files
generated during and pertinent to that client's defense. It further
entitles the client to utilize materials contained in these files in any
proceeding at which the adequacy of trial counsel's representation
may be challenged.'

consider along with his client the various defensive strategies that might be
available. In other words, he argues that he will be less likely to provide
effective assistance of counsel, and yet this is precisely the issue petitioner
wishes to investigate. I cannot accept that a lawyer should oppose the disclosure of recorded thoughts that do not evidence ineffective assistance; nor can
I accept that petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights do not prevail over his lawyer's asserted privacy interests where that lawyer's recorded thoughts may
reflect that ineffective assistance has in fact been rendered.

This case presents the question whether any portion of the cost
of a factory's electrical system qualifies for the investment tax
credit under § 38 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. § 38,
and if so, what portion. The Code defines "section 38 property"
to include "tangible personal property" and "other tangible property," such as industrial machinery, but to exclude "a building and
its structural components." 26 U. S. C. §§48(a)(1)(A), (B). In
this case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that
the cost of installation of a factory's electrical distribution system

OCTOBER TERM, 1986

December 1, 1986

479 U. S.

must be allocated between "section 38 property" and "non-section
38 property" according to a ratio by which electrical usage is divided between the operation of machinery, on the one hand, and
ordinary building maintenance, like lighting and climate control,
on the other. 789 F. 2d 1234 (1986). As applied to the facts before it, this interpretation resulted in qualification for the investment tax credit of 95% of the cost of the factory's electrical system. The Court of Appeals adopted this theory of allocation from
the Tax Court's decision in Scott Paper Co. v. Commissioner, 74
T. C. 137, 182-187 (1980). The Fourth Circuit in A. C. Monk &
Co. v. United States, 686 F. 2d 1058, 1065-1066 (1982), rejected
the allocation method adopted by the Tax Court in Scott Paper
and held that an electrical system can qualify for the credit only
if it is so "inextricably linked to the present, specific machinery"
that it cannot "be reasonably adapted in the present building to
more general uses." If a manufacturer converting the building to
another use would be able, with reasonable alterations, to use the
existing system, the system is a structural component; if the existing system essentially would have to be scrapped, it qualifies for
the investment tax credit. The issue involves many other taxpayers, and I would grant certiorari to resolve this conflict.

dissenting.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
held below that petitioner's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel was not violated when he was refused counsel at
his preliminary hearing on a capital murder charge, because the
denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing was harmless error.

MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

I
Petitioner Donald Wayne Thomas was convicted of murder and
sentenced to death after jury trial. The State of Georgia charged
petitioner, who was then 19 years old, with the murder of a 9-yearold boy. At the preliminary hearing 10 days after petitioner's arrest, petitioner requested an opportunity to retain private counsel,
indicating that he did not wish to be represented by the public defender. The court denied petitioner's request, excused the public
defender, and held the preliminary hearing in the absence of any
defense counsel. The State's main witness, a 15-year-old mentally
retarded girl, then testified without cross-examination that petitioner had told her he had committed the murder, and had shown
her the body. This testimony differed in various material respects
from the later testimony given by this witness at trial.
On direct appeal from petitioner's subsequent conviction, the
Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.
Thomas v. State, 245 Ga. 688, 266 S. E. 2d 499 (1980). This Court
granted certiorari, vacated the sentence of death, and remanded for
reconsideration in light of Godfrey v. Georgia,446 U. S. 420 (1980).
Thomas v. Georgia, 449 U. S. 988 (1980). On remand, the Georgia
Supreme Court reinstated the death sentence, without benefit of
further briefing or oral argument. Thomas v. State, 247 Ga. 233,
275 S. E. 2d 318, cert. denied, 452 U. S. 973 (1981). Having exhausted in state postconviction proceedings claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct at the sentencing phase of the trial, petitioner's counsel brought a federal habeas
corpus action raising those issues.
During the pendency of the federal petition, counsel, who had
not represented petitioner at trial, first discovered the preliminary hearing transcript in the files of the public defender's office,
and realized that petitioner had been denied counsel at his preliminary hearing. Counsel notified the District Court that Thomas
would move to amend his federal habeas petition as soon as the
new claim could be presented to the state courts for exhaustion.
Relief on this claim was denied in new state proceedings, and petitioner's counsel moved to amend the federal petition. The District Court vacated petitioner's death sentence on the ground that
petitioner had not received effective assistance of counsel at the
sentencing phase of his trial, but denied the motion to amend the
petition as untimely. As an alternative ground of decision, the
District Court also held that even if the claim were timely pre-

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
MARSHALL,

J., dissenting

479 U. S.

sented, the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing had been
harmless error.
Both parties appealed from the District Court's order. The
Court of Appeals affirmed. 796 F. 2d 1322 (1986). On the denialof-counsel claim, the Court of Appeals adopted the District Court's
alternative ground, holding that "[t]he prosecution has carried
its burden of persuading this Court that, even if constitutional
error was established, the error was harmless." Id., at 1326.
Finding that "Thomas' [trial] counsel had access to the transcript
of the preliminary hearing," "knew the nature of the State's case,"
and "sought and received early psychiatric examinations and evaluations on Thomas," the Court of Appeals concluded that "Thomas
was not prejudiced by his counsel's absence at the preliminary
hearing." Id., at 1327.
II
It has been settled for more than half a century that a defendant
facing capital charges is entitled to the assistance of counsel.
Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932). The right to counsel, it
was then recognized, is not merely a right to trial counsel, but a
right to the assistance of counsel in preparing a defense throughout the period from arraignment to trial; defendants are "as much
entitled to such aid during that period as at the trial itself." Id.,
at 57. Our recognition of the right to counsel has substantially increased in the period since Powell was decided. See, e. g., Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25 (1972); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335 (1963); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938). It is
astonishing to me that the Court of Appeals so readily determined, despite our repeated holdings to the contrary, that it is not
per se constitutional error to deny the assistance of counsel to a
defendant whose life the State intends to take.
In support of its conclusion that the denial of counsel in the preliminary hearing of a capital prosecution can be harmless error,
the Court of Appeals relied upon Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U. S.
1 (1970), in which this Court remanded for consideration of harmless error under Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), the
denial of counsel at a preliminary hearing. This reliance is fundamentally misplaced, for Coleman was not a capital case. As
Chief Justice Burger stated for the Court in Holloway v. Arkan-

ORDERS

December 1, 1986

479 U. S.

sas, 435 U. S. 475, 489 (1978), "when a defendant is deprived of
the presence and assistance of his attorney, either throughout the
prosecution or during a critical stage in, at least, the prosecution
of a capital offense, reversal is automatic."*
Our recent cases make clear that, contrary to the Court of Appeals' conclusion below, denial of counsel at any critical stage of
a criminal prosecution is per se constitutional error. "Actual or
constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether is legally
presumed to result in prejudice." Strickland v. Washington, 466
U. S. 668, 692 (1984). "The presumption that counsel's assistance
is essential requires us to conclude that a trial is unfair if the accused is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial." United
States v. Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 659 (1984) (footnote omitted).
Petitioner's capital trial was unfair for precisely this reason. The
Court of Appeals' casual conclusion that "[c]ounsel could not have
revealed defects in the State's case so great that the magistrate
would have refused to bind the petitioner over to the State's custody," 796 F. 2d, at 1327, is nothing more than speculation of a
kind which the Constitution will not countenance. Mere recitation of the words "harmless error" is not a constitutionally sufficient basis on which to permit the State to deny the assistance of
any lawyer at all to a defendant against whom the State is seeking
the death penalty.
I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari.

to JUSTICE WHITE, and by him referred to the Court, denied.
JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.

Adhering to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth
and Fourteenth Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153,
227, 231 (1976), we would grant the application for stay in order
to give the applicant time to file a petition for writ of certiorari
and would grant the petition and vacate the death sentence in this
case.

Cer-

dissenting.
In this case, the Supreme Court of the State of Alaska affirmed
the petitioner's conviction, rejecting his argument that the trial
judge improperly instructed the jury on a lesser included offense.
Dresnek v. State, 718 P. 2d 156 (1986). Over the petitioner's objection, the trial judge gave a "transition instruction"; the jurors
were instructed that they could not render a verdict on a lesser
included offense until they unanimously acquitted the petitioner
on the greater offense. The Alaska Supreme Court held that the
instruction was proper. This decision conflicts with the approach
JUSTICE WHITE,

followed in the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Ninth Circuits. In United States v. Tsanas, 572 F. 2d 340 (CA2), cert.
denied, 435 U. S. 995 (1978), the court held that if a defendant
seasonably objects to this type of instruction, the trial judge should
instruct the jury with an alternative formulation: jurors may consider the lesser included offense if they cannot reach agreement on
the greater offense. 572 F. 2d, at 346. The Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Jackson, 726 F. 2d 1466
(1984), followed the Tsanas approach. There, the court reasoned
that "although either formulation may be employed if the defendant
expresses no choice, it is error to reject the form timely requested
by defendant." 726 F. 2d, at 1469. I would grant the petition of
certiorari to resolve this conflict.

OCTOBER TERM, 1986
WHITE,

J., dissenting

479 U. S.

dissenting.
Petitioners are two political subdivisions in the State of Florida
that have filed a single petition for certiorari, under this Court's
Rule 19.4, seeking review of two separate judgments of the
Supreme Court of Florida. Both cases present the same federal
constitutional question; I set forth the facts in Martin County v.
Makemson only.
Respondent Robert Makemson was appointed under Florida law
to represent a defendant charged with first-degree murder, kidnaping, and armed robbery. Respondent's representation of the
defendant spanned a 9-month period, and upon completion of the
task respondent petitioned the trial court, pursuant to Fla. Stat.
§925.036 (1985),* for attorney's fees in the amount of $9,500.
Section 925.036(2)(d) establishes a limit of $3,500 on compensation
to appointed attorneys who represent capital defendants at trial.
Notwithstanding this provision, the state trial court awarded respondent the $9,500 he requested, declaring that "'in setting rigid
maximum fees without regard to the circumstances in each case[,
§ 925.036] is arbitrary and capricious and violates the due process
clause of the United States and Florida Constitutions."' 491
So. 2d 1109, 1111 (1986). The Fourth District Court of Appeals
quashed the trial court's order declaring § 925.036 unconstitutional
and certified several pertinent questions to the Florida Supreme
Court. 464 So. 2d 1281 (1985). The Supreme Court held, inter
alia, that the statute, while facially valid, was unconstitutional as
applied to this case. The court reasoned:
"[W]e find that the statutory maximum fees, as inflexibly
imposed in cases involving unusual or extraordinary circumJUSTICE WHITE,

*Florida Stat. § 925.036 (1985) provides, in relevant part:
"(1) An attorney appointed pursuant to s. 925.035 or s. 27.53 shall, at the
conclusion of the representation, be compensated at an hourly rate fixed by
the chief judge or senior judge of the circuit in an amount not to exceed the
prevailing hourly rate for similar representation rendered in the circuit; however, such compensation shall not exceed the maximum fee limits established
by this section ....
"(2) The compensation for representation shall not exceed the following:
"(a) For misdemeanors and juveniles represented at the trial level: $1,000.

"(b)
"(c)
"(d)
"(e)

For noncapital, nonlife felonies represented at the trial level: $2,500.
For life felonies represented at the trial level: $3,000.
For capital cases represented at the trial level: $3,500.
For representation on appeal: $2,000."

WHITE,

J., dissenting

stances, interfere with the defendant's sixth amendment right
'to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.' The statute, as applied to many of today's cases, provides for only
token compensation. The availability of effective counsel is
therefore called into question in those cases when it is needed
most.
"[Section 925.036] interferes with the sixth amendment
[W]e must not lose sight of the fact that
right to counsel ....
it is the defendant's right to effective representation rather
than the attorney's right to fair compensation which is our
focus." 491 So. 2d, at 1112.
This Court has never held that the Sixth Amendment right to
counsel, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires the States and their political subdivisions to pay
appointed counsel reasonable compensation for their services. Indeed, under our existing cases, I discern nothing in the Sixth
Amendment that would prohibit a State from requiring its lawyers
to represent indigent criminal defendants without any compensation for their services at all. By my view, Florida had no Sixth
Amendment duty to enact § 925.036; it follows a fortiori that the
Sixth Amendment does not require the State or its political subdivisions to pay more than the limits established in that statute.
This view is consistent with our decision in Powell v. Alabama,
287 U. S. 45 (1932). There, the Court held that a state trial court
had a duty to assign counsel in a capital case where the defendant
was unable to employ an attorney and was incapable of representing himself. The Court asserted that "[a]ttorneys are officers of
the court, and are bound to render service when required by such
an appointment." Id., at 73.
Even were I not of this view, I would still vote to grant the petition for certiorari because the decisions in these cases conflict
with the decisions of other courts. In Williamson v. Vardeman,
674 F. 2d 1211, 1214 (1982), for example, the Eighth Circuit held
that the courts of Missouri could constitutionally compel private
attorneys to represent indigent defendants without compensation
for their services. And, in New Jersey v. Rush, 46 N. J. 399, 217
A. 2d 441 (1966), the Supreme Court of New Jersey expressly rejected the argument that the Sixth Amendment mandates payment of fees to appointed counsel. The court assumed-perhaps

OCTOBER TERM, 1986

479 U. S.

gratuitously-that an attorney had standing to assert the Sixth
Amendment right of his client, and stated that it knew "of no data
to support a claim that an assigned attorney fails or shirks in the
least the full measure of an attorney's obligation to a client....
A lawyer needs no motivation beyond his sense of duty and his
pride." Id., at 405-406, 217 A. 2d, at 444.
This petition presents an important issue of constitutional law
that the Court should address. I respectfully dissent from the
denial of certiorari.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE
O'CONNOR join, dissenting.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held in this case
that a city ordinance limiting door-to-door soliciting to the hours
between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday, violated
the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 796 F. 2d 1547 (1986). It is undisputed that the ordinance is content neutral. The purpose of the ordinance is to protect citizens' privacy and to prevent crime, obviously legitimate
governmental objectives as the Court of Appeals recognized. The
Court of Appeals nevertheless concluded that the ordinance impermissibly restricted First Amendment activities because the
city had less restrictive alternatives to accomplish its objectives.
We have held, however, that a time, place, and manner restriction
is valid if it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest and leaves open ample alternative channels for
communication of the information, and we have not imposed the
requirement that the restriction be the least restrictive means
available. See Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U. S. 288, 293-294 (1984); see also Regan v. Time, Inc., 468
U. S. 641, 657 (1984) ("The less-restrictive-alternative analysis
has never been a part of the inquiry into the validity of a
time, place, and manner regulation. It is enough that the ... re...

striction substantially serves the Government's legitimate ends")
(opinion of WHITE, J.). Because the decision below departs from
this standard, I would note probable jurisdiction.

JUSTICE WHITE, with whom JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins,
dissenting.
These cases present the question whether the discretionaryfunction exception to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act,
28 U. S. C. § 2680(a), encompasses governmental decisions involving allocation of resources. The Court of Appeals in these cases
held that such decisions are covered by the discretionary-function
exception. 790 F. 2d 199, 202 (CA1 1986). Other Courts of Appeals have rejected this view. See Eklof Marine Corp. v. United
States, 762 F. 2d 200, 204 (CA2 1985). See also Aslakson v.
United States, 790 F. 2d 688, 693 (CA8 1986). I would grant one
of these petitions to resolve the conflict.

JUSTICE

WHITE,

with whom

THE

CHIEF JUSTICE

joins,

dissenting.
The Jones Act, 38 Stat. 1185, as amended, 46 U. S. C. § 688(a),
provides that "[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the

course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action
for damages at law ... ." This case presents the question of who
is a "seaman" for purposes of the Jones Act.
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, both in this case and
in its previous cases, has taken an expansive view in defining who
is a seaman. The Fifth Circuit, relying on its earlier opinion in
Offshore Co. v. Robison, 266 F. 2d 769 (1959), has taken the position that to be a seaman, a person need not assist in the transportation function of a vessel. See Barrett v. Chevron, U. S. A.,
Inc., 781 F. 2d 1067, 1073 (1986) (en banc). Other Courts of Appeals, particularly the Third and Seventh Circuits, have rejected
this view and require that before a plaintiff can sue under the
Jones Act, he must be employed in such a way as to assist in the
navigational function of a vessel.
See Johnson v. John F.
Beasley Construction Co., 742 F. 2d 1054, 1061 (CA7 1984) ("[W]e
think the second part of the Robison test strays from important
Jones Act principles when it speaks of the employee's duties as
having to relate only to the 'function of the vessel or the accomplishment of its mission' without further qualifying 'function' and
'mission' in terms of the transportationfunction and mission of the
vessel") (emphasis in original), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1211 (1985);
Simko v. C & C Marine Maintenance Co., 594 F. 2d 960, 964-965
(CA3), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 833 (1979).

supra, at 1076 (Gee, J., specially concurring).
