ANTITRUST ACTS.
1, Alcoholic beverages-Prices-Validity of state law.-A New York
statute requiring liquor retailers to charge at least 112% of wholesaler's
bottle price "posted" monthly with a state agency was inconsistent with § 1
of Sherman Act, and State's pricing system was not valid under stateaction exemption from antitrust laws; nor was pricing system valid under
Twenty-first Amendment. 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, p. 335.
2. Proposed merger- Competitor's action to enjoin. -Respondent beef
packer could not maintain action under § 16 of Clayton Act to enjoin
merger of two competitors, absent an allegation and proof of an "antitrust
injury," such as merged competitors' predatory pricing designed to drive
other companies out of market; proposed merger did not itself constitute a
threat of antitrust injury, and a showing, as here, of loss or damage due
merely to increased competition does not constitute such injury. Cargill,

housing authority could maintain private cause of action against respondent under 42 U. S. C. § 1983, alleging that respondent overbilled petitioners for their utilities and thereby violated rent ceiling imposed by Housing

obligation does not include a duty to accept an employee's proposed alternative accommodation even if it would not cause undue hardship on conduct

of employer's business; employer has met its obligation when it demonstrates that it has offered a reasonable accommodation to employees, and
this case was remanded for application of proper standards to petitioner
School Board's policy as to accommodating respondent teacher's religious
tenets prohibiting secular employment during designated holy days. Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook, p. 60.
2. Discrimination in employment-Pregnancy-Pre-emption of state
law. -Title VII of Act, as amended by Pregnancy Discrimination Act, does
not pre-empt a California statute requiring employers to provide leave and
reinstatement to employees disabled by pregnancy. California Federal
Savings & Loan Assn. v. Guerra, p. 272.
CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY'S FEES AWARDS ACT OF 1976.
Administrative proceedings-Attorney's fees.- Respondents were not
entitled to claim attorney's fees under Act, where (1) they filed an administrative complaint with United States Department of Transportation
challenging petitioner North Carolina Department of Transportation's proposed extension of a federally funded expressway through a predominantly
black neighborhood of a city as violative of Title VI of Civil Rights Act of
1964, (2) ultimately, petitioners, respondents, and city executed a Final
Mitigation Plan, (3) meanwhile, expressway extension was enjoined by
Federal District Court in an unrelated action that did not involve any civil
rights laws, (4) respondents moved to intervene in that action and filed a
proposed complaint asserting Title VI violations, (5) court subsequently
entered a consent judgment dissolving injunction and dismissing action on
condition that petitioners implement Final Mitigation Plan, which was
done, and (6) respondent then filed this action in District Court for attorney's fees for services performed by counsel in preparing administrative
complaint and in negotiating resolution of dispute. North Carolina Dept.
of Transportation v. Crest Street Community Council, Inc., p. 6.

I. Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
Capitaloffense-Penalty phase of trial-Juryinstruction.-At penalty
phase of respondent's trial, which resulted in a capital offense conviction
and death penalty, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments were not violated
by an instruction that jury "must not be swayed by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling."
California v. Brown, p. 538.
II. Due Process.
Confessions-Voluntariness.-Since coercive police activity is a necessary predicate to finding that a confession is not "voluntary" within meaning of Due Process Clause, respondent's confession should not have been
suppressed, where he approached police officer and stated that he wanted
to talk about a murder he had committed, and, after he was given Miranda
warnings, he said again that he wanted to confess-even though subsequent psychiatric interviews revealed that he was following the "voice
of God" in confessing, and psychiatrist testified that respondent suffered
from a psychosis interfering with his ability to make rational choices and
motivating his confession; in considering a motion to suppress a statement
allegedly obtained in violation of Miranda, State need prove waiver only
by a preponderance of evidence. Colorado v. Connelly, p. 157.
III. Freedom of Association.
1. Elections -Candidate's ballot access-Validity of state statute.-A
Washington statute requiring that a minor-party candidate receive at least
1% of all votes cast for office in State's primary election before candidate's
name will be placed on general election ballot does not violate First
Amendment freedom of association rights of such candidates, minor parties, or voters. Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, p. 189.
2. Primary elections-Validity of state statute.-A 1955 Connecticut
statute requiring voters in any political party primary to be registered
party members violated First Amendment freedom of association rights of
appellee Republican Party of Connecticut, which, in 1984, adopted a rule
permitting independent voters to vote in Republican primaries for federal
and statewide offices; implementation of Party rule would not violate
Qualifications Clause of Constitution and parallel provision of Seventeenth
Amendment as to qualifications for voting in congressional elections.
Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, p. 208.

INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW-Continued.
IV. Freedom of Speech.
Federal Election CampaignAct-Corporate expenditures.-Section 316
of Federal Election Campaign Act, which prohibits expenditures from a
corporation's general funds in connection with any federal election, was
violated by publication and distribution of a "Special Edition" of a newsletter by appellee, a nonprofit, nonstock corporation formed to foster respect
for human life, where "Special Edition" exhorted readers to vote for identified "pro-life" candidates in upcoming state primary elections for state and
federal offices, but §316, as applied to appellee, was unconstitutional as
infringing protected speech without a compelling justification. FEC v.
Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., p. 238.
V. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.
Murder confession-Voluntariness.-Where (1) after respondent's arrest by federal officers for interstate transportation of firearms, he was
advised of, and waived, his Miranda rights, (2) during interrogation on
firearms transactions, he admitted that he had "shot another guy once,"
but denied shooting a certain person, and (3) when later questioned by a
state police officer, respondent again waived his Mirandarights and gave a
written confession to murder of that other person, federal officers' failure
to inform him that he would be questioned about killing could not have affected his decision to waive his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and
thus did not render murder confession inadmissible at state murder trial.
Colorado v. Spring, p. 564.
VI. Right to Counsel.
Confessions-Voluntariness.-Where (1) while in custody on suspicion
of sexual assault, respondent was given, and acknowledged in writing receipt of, Mirandawarnings on three occasions, (2) he indicated willingness
to make oral statements but said that he would not make written statement
outside counsel's presence, (3) he then orally admitted involvement in sexual assault, and (4) an officer's written recollection of respondent's confession was introduced in evidence, trial court properly found that respondent's decision to speak to police constituted a voluntary waiver of his right
to counsel, and Constitution did not require suppression of incriminating
statement. Connecticut v. Barrett, p. 523.
VII. Searches and Seizures.
Vehicles-Impoundment searches. -Where (1) respondent was arrested
for drunken driving, and (2) before a tow truck arrived to take his van to an
impoundment lot, an officer, acting pursuant to police procedures, inventoried van's contents and opened a backpack in which he found containers
holding drugs, drug paraphernalia, and cash, Fourth Amendment did not

VIII. States' Regulation of Liquor.
Licensed business -Prohibition of nude dancing.-A city ordinance
prohibiting nude or nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to sell
liquor for consumption on premises is constitutional as being within States'
regulatory authority under Twenty-first Amendment, and does not violate
First Amendment, notwithstanding state-law requirement that a city secure approval by local election to ban alcohol sales. Newport v. Iacobucci,

MOOTNESS.
Case or controversy-"Pocket-veto" of bill.-For Article III case-orcontroversy purposes, case was moot where (1) Court of Appeals had held
that a bill-which conditioned continuance of military aid to El Salvador
upon President's semiannual certification of that nation's progress in
protecting human rights-had become law despite President's effort to
"pocket-veto" it, but (2) bill expired by its own terms a few weeks later;
any controversy over Acting Archivist's failure to publish bill in Statutes at
Large or any dispute as to accounting obligations relating to expenditure of
funds under bill was not sufficient to prevent mootness. Burke v. Barnes,

contending that bank discount brokerage offices were bank branches prohibited under Act's provisions; however, Comptroller did not exceed his
