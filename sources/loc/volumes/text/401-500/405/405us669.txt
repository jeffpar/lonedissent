APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF INDIANA

No. 70-5082.

Argued November 8,1971-Decided April 3, 1972

Appellants' challenge to the Indiana welfare regulation that provides

that a person who seeks assistance due to separation or the desertion of a spouse is not entitled to aid until the spouse has been
continuously absent for at least six months, unless there are exceptional circumstances of need, was dismissed for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies, and alternatively on the grounds of lack
of jurisdiction and failure of the pleadings to present a substantial
federal question. Held: The District Court plainly had jurisdiction, and exhaustion is not required in the circumstances of this
case. Damico v. California, 389 U. S. 416. If that court's
characterization of the federal question as insubstantial was based
on the face of the complaint, it was error; if the court treated the
motion to dismiss as one for summary judgment, its order is unilluminating as to the relevant facts or the applicable law, and
was improperly entered.
Vacated and remanded.

Solicitor General Griswold and Richard B. Stone filed
a brief for the United States as amicus curiae.
PER CURIAM.

Appellants are women who contend that an Indiana
welfare regulation governing eligibility for state and
federal aid to dependent children contravenes the Fourteenth Amendment and the Social Security Act, 49 Stat.
627, as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 602 (a)(10). The regulation provides that a person who seeks assistance due to
separation or the desertion of a spouse is not entitled to
aid until the spouse has been continuously absent for at
least six months, unless there are exceptional circumstances of need. Burns Ind. Admin. Rules & Regs. (521001)-2 (1967). Appellants brought this action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Indiana, basing jurisdiction on 42 U. S. C. § 1983 and 28
U. S. C. § 1343, and seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief. A three-judge court was convened pursuant
to 28 U. S. C. § 2281. After a "preliminary hearing on
defendants'" motion to dismiss "at which the court"
received evidence upon which to resolve the matter, the
court dismissed the complaint on the ground that none
of the claimants had exercised her right under Indiana
law to appeal from a county decision denying welfare
assistance, Burns Ind. Admin. Rules & Regs. (52-1211)-1
(Supp. 1970), and therefore appellants had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. In the alternative, the
court held that the pleadings did not present a substantial
federal question and that the court lacked jurisdiction
under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 and 28 U. S. C. §§ 2201, 2202.
Carter v. Stanton, No. IP 70-C--124 (SD Ind., Dec. 11,
1970). This direct appeal followed and we noted probable jurisdiction. 402 U. S. 994 (1971).
Contrary to the State's view, our jurisdiction

appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1253 is satisfactorily established. Sullivan v. Alabama State Bar, 394 U. S. 812,
aff'g 295 F. Supp. 1216 (MD Ala. 1969); Whitney
Stores, Inc. v. Summerford, 393 U. S. 9, aff'g 280 F.
Supp. 406 (SC 1968). Also, the District Court plainly
had jurisdiction of this case pursuant to 42 U. S. C.
§ 1983 and 28 U. S. C. § 1343. Damico v. California,
389 U. S. 416 (1967). Damico, aih indistinguishable case,
likewise establishes that exhaustion is not required in
circumstances such as those presented here. Cf. McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U. S. 668 (1963);
Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961).
Finally, if the court's characterization of the federal
question presented as insubstantial was based on the
face of the complaint, as it seems to have been, it was
error. Cf. Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471 (1970);
Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969); Damico v.
California,.supra. But it appears that at the hearing on
the motion to dismiss, which was based in part on the
asserted failure "to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted" (App. 19), matters outside the pleadings were
presented and not excluded by the court. The court
was therefore required by Rule 12 (b) of the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure to treat the motion to dismiss
as one for summary judgment and to dispose of it as
provided in Rule 56. Under Rule 56, summary judg
ment cannot be granted unless there is no genuine issue
as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled
to judgment as a matter of law. If this is the course
the District Court followed, its order is opaque and
unilluminating as to either the relevant facts or the
law with respect to the merits of appellants' claim. In
this posture of the case, we are unconvinced that summary judgment was properly entered. The judgment of

this opinion.

took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
MR. JUsTICE DOUGLAS.

I agree that both this Court and the District Court
have jurisdiction to entertain this case and that the
appellants were not required to exhaust administrative
remedies before launching their challenge. But, although the District Court should have made more complete findings of fact and conclusions of law, I would
not remand simply on this score but would hold that
the appellants are entitled to judgment.
The problem is simple and should be disposed of here.
The federal Act defines a "dependent child" as a
"needy child . . . who has been deprived of parental
support or care by reason of . . . continued absence from
the home." 1 Indiana by its Board of Public Welfare has
adopted the federal definition of "needy child." I
The term "continued absence from the home" is not defined in the federal Act, though HEW recommends "that
no period of time be specified as a basis for establishing
continued absence as an eligibility factor." I Indiana,
however, has established by rule a definition of "continued absence" in case of "desertion or separation." In
those two instances it makes "continued absence" mean
that "the absence shall have been continuous" for at least

six months,' except when the department of welfare
finds there are "exceptional circumstances of need."
A dependent child gets aid immediately and continuously in case the parent is incarcerated or in case the
parent is inducted into the armed services. The sixmonth rule creates a separate class of needy children
who by the federal standard may be as "needy" as those
in the other two categories.
The federal Act directs that "aid to families with dependent children shall be furnished with reasonable
promptness to all eligible individuals." I The federal
regulation requires decisions on applications to be made
'promptly" and "not in excess of'" 30 days and that the
assistance check or notification of denial be mailed within
that period.6 As noted, the federal Act contains no waiting period to establish "continued absence." And the
HEW Handbook, already referred to,' states as respects
"continued absence" that "[a] child comes within this
interpretation if for any reason his parent is absent." '
4Burns,
Ind. Admin. Rules & Regs. (52-1001)-2 (1967): "When
the continued absence is due to desertion or separation, the absence
shall have been continuous for a period of at least six [6] months
prior to the date of application for assistance to dependent children;
except that under exceptional circumstances of need and where it is
determined that the absence of a parent is actual and bona fide an
application may be filed and a child may be considered immediately
eligible upon a special finding of the county department of public
welfare setting forth the facts and reasons for such action."

Here, as in CaliforniaHuman Resources Dept. v.'Java,
402 U. S. 121, 135, the State's program "tends to frustrate" the Social Security Act. King v. Smith, 392 U. S.
309, "establishes that, at least in the absence of congressional authorization for the exclusion clearly evidenced
from the Social Security Act or its legislative history, a
state eligibility standard that excludes persons eligible
for assistance under federal AFDC standards violates the
Social Security Act and is therefore invalid under the
Supremacy Clause." Townsend v. Swank, 404 U. S. 282,
286. While a State has a legitimate interest in preveating
fraud, there are, as we said in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394
U. S. 618, 637, "less drastic means" available "to minimize that hazard." Rather than remanding for a lower
court determination of the law of the case, the merits
ought to be decided now inasmuch as (a) the facts are
essentially undisputed, (b) the appellants' claim based
on the federal Act is plainly correct, and (c) further
litigation would work a hardship upon welfare recipients
affected by the Indiana rule. See generally Note, Individualized Criminal Justice In The Supreme Court:
A Study Of Dispositional Decision Making, 81 Harv. L.

or to terminate the parent's functioning as a provider of maintenance, physical care, or guidance for the child; and
"3. When the known or indefinite duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent's performance of his function in
planning for the present support or care of the child.
"A child comes within this interpretation if for any reason his
parent is absent, and this absence interferes with the child's receiving
maintenance, physical care, or guidance from his parent, and precludes the parent's being counted on for support or care of the child.
For example: The child's father has left home, without forewarning
his family, and the mother really does not know why he left home,
nor when or whether he will return."

Opinion of DouaLAS, J.

The Indiana regulation so plainly collides with the
federal Act that I would end this frivolous defense to
this welfare litigation by deciding the merits and reversing by reason of the Supremacy Clause.
