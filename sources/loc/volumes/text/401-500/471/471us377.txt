ARKANSAS v. MISSISSIPPI
Final Decree

ARKANSAS v. MISSISSIPPI
ON BILL OF COMPLAINT
No. 92, Orig. Final decree entered April 29, 1985

FINAL DECREE
The Report of the Special Master is received and ordered
filed. The parties have presented a stipulation for entry of
the proposed agreed decree. The Report of the Special Master is adopted and a final decree is entered accordingly.
IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED As FOLLOWS:
1. The common boundary between the States of Arkansas
and Mississippi in the Mississippi River is the thalweg, which
is the middle of the main navigable channel followed as the
principal course of downstream navigation. This judgment
determines the geographical location of this boundary in the
reach of the Mississippi River, as more particularly described
hereinafter, separating portions of Lee County, Arkansas
and Tunica County, Mississippi in the vicinity of Bordeaux
Point and Whiskey Island/Bordeaux Island.
2. Establishment of the common Arkansas-Mississippi
boundary in "old" Walnut Bend, looping Whiskey Island/
Bordeaux Island, originated with the Bordeaux Chute Cutoff, which occurred in or about 1874 and was complete in or
about 1883. The locus of that portion of the state boundary
consisting of approximately the eastern one-half of "old" Walnut Bend has been subsequently established by long acquiescence by the States of Arkansas and Mississippi in private
boundary lines resulting from prior litigation and agreements
among the owners of lands adjacent thereto. The locus of
these private boundaries, which the States of Arkansas and
Mississippi have adopted by acquiescence as also being the
locus of the interstate boundary, is as shown on the map
of Mr. W. H. Guyer, a true and correct copy of which is

attached hereto as Exhibit "A"* and described by geodetic
coordinates as Segment B, Points PA through PL, in the
composite description set forth hereinafter. The remainder
of the interstate boundary in approximately the western onehalf of "old" Walnut Bend lies along the dead thalweg of the
Mississippi River as it existed when the River's flow ceased
in this abandoned bendway subsequent to, and caused by, the
Bordeaux Chute Cutoff. The locus of this portion of the interstate boundary in "old" Walnut Bend is as shown in Exhibit "B" and described as Segment B, Points Pm through
Pbb in the composite description set forth hereinafter.
3. Establishment of the common Arkansas-Mississippi
boundary along the southerly limit of Bordeaux Point originated with the Hardin Point Cutoff, constructed by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1942. In 1947,
when the Mississippi River ceased to flow in this abandoned
bendway (Fox Island Bend), the locus of the state boundary
along the dead thalweg was determined by Mr. St. George
Richardson, whose plat thereof has been accepted since that
time by the States of Arkansas and Mississippi as correctly
depicting this portion of the interstate boundary looping
Bordeaux Point. A true and correct copy of the St. George
Richardson survey is attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and
described as Segment D in the composite description set
forth hereinafter.
The common Arkansas-Mississippi boundary looping Bordeaux Point between Lee County, Arkansas and Tunica
County, Mississippi, from the upper end of Mhoon Bend to
the upper end of Fox Island Bend, exclusive of that portion
of this boundary in "old" Walnut Bend looping Whiskey
Island/Bordeaux Island, is depicted on Exhibit "D" and deNOTE: It is not practicable to attach copies of Exhibits
"A," "B," "C," and "D" for purposes of publishing the decree in the United
States Reports. True and correct copies of the Exhibits are on file in the
Office of the Clerk. See also paragraph 6 of the decree.]
