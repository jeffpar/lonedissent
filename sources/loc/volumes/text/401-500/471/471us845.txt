NATIONAL FARMERS UNION INSURANCE COS.
ET AL. V. CROW TRIBE OF INDIANS ET AL.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE NINTH CIRCUIT
No. 84-320.

Argued April 16, 1985-Decided June 3, 1985

Respondent Crow Indian minor was struck by a motorcycle in the parking
lot of a school located within the Crow Indian Reservation but on land
owned by the State of Montana. Through his guardian, the minor
brought a damages action in the Crow Tribal Court against petitioner
School District, a political subdivision of the State, and obtained a
default judgment. Thereafter, the School District and its insurer, also a
petitioner, brought an action in Federal District Court for injunctive
relief, invoking as a basis for federal jurisdiction 28 U. S. C. § 1331,
which provides that a federal district court "shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of
the United States." The District Court held that the Tribal Court had
no jurisdiction over a civil action against a non-Indian and accordingly
entered an injunction against execution of the Tribal Court judgment.
The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the District Court had no
jurisdiction to enter such an injunction.
Held:
1. Section 1331 encompasses the federal question whether the Tribal
Court exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction. Since petitioners
contend that federal law has divested the Tribe of its power to compel a
non-Indian property owner to submit to the civil jurisdiction of the
Tribal Court, it is federal law on which petitioners rely as a basis for the
asserted right of freedom from Tribal Court interference. They have,
therefore, filed an action "arising under" federal law within the meaning
of § 1331. Pp. 850-853.
2. Exhaustion of Tribal Court remedies is required, however, before
petitioners' claim may be entertained by the District Court. The existence and extent of the Tribal Court's jurisdiction requires a careful
examination of tribal sovereignty and the extent to which that sovereignty has been altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed
study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions. Such an
examination and study should be conducted in the first instance by the
Tribal Court. Pp. 853-857.
3. Until petitioners have exhausted the available remedies in the
Tribal Court, it would be premature for the District Court to consider

any relief. Whether the federal action should be dismissed or merely
held in abeyance pending the development of the Tribal Court proceedings is a question that should be addressed in the first instance by the
District Court. P. 857.

JUSTICE STEVENS

Opinion of the Court

delivered the opinion of the Court.

A member of the Crow Tribe of Indians filed suit against
the Lodge Grass School District No. 27 (School District) in
the Crow Tribal Court and obtained a default judgment.
Thereafter, the School District and its insurer, National
Farmers Union Insurance Companies (National), commenced
this litigation in the District Court for the District of Montana; that court was persuaded that the Crow Tribal Court
had no jurisdiction over a civil action against a non-Indian
and entered an injunction against further proceedings in the
Tribal Court. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
the District Court had no jurisdiction to enter such an injunction. We granted certiorari to consider whether the District
Court properly entertained petitioners' request for an injunction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331. 469 U. S. 1032 (1984).
The facts as found by the District Court are not substantially disputed. On May 27, 1982, Leroy Sage, a Crow Indian minor, was struck by a motorcycle in the Lodge Grass
Elementary School parking lot while returning from a school
activity. The school has a student body that is 85% Crow
Indian. It is located on land owned by the State within the
boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation. Through his
guardian, Flora Not Afraid, Sage initiated a lawsuit in the
Crow Tribal Court against the School District, a political
subdivision of the State, alleging damages of $153,000, including medical expenses of $3,000 and pain and suffering of

$150,000.
On September 28, 1982, process was served by Dexter
Falls Down on Wesley Falls Down, the Chairman of the
School Board. For reasons that have not been explained,
Wesley Falls Down failed to notify anyone that a suit had
been filed. On October 19, 1982, a default judgment was
entered pursuant to the rules of the Tribal Court, and on
Jr., W. Richard West, Jr., Reid Peyton Chambers, Kevin A. Griffin, and
George E. Fettinger;and for the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community et al. by Rodney B. Lewis and Richard B. Wilks.

OCTOBER TERM, 1984
Opinion of the Court

471 U. S.

October 25, 1982, Judge Roundface entered findings of fact,
conclusions of law, and a judgment for $153,000 against the
School District. Sage v. Lodge Grass School District, 10
Indian L. Rep. 6019 (1982). A copy of that judgment was
hand-delivered by Wesley Falls Down to the school Principal
who, in turn, forwarded it to National on October 29, 1982.
On November 3, 1982, National and the School District
(petitioners) filed a verified complaint and a motion for a temporary restraining order in the District Court for the District
of Montana. The complaint named as defendants the Crow
Tribe of Indians, the Tribal Council, the Tribal Court, judges
of the court, and the Chairman of the Tribal Council. It
described the entry of the default judgment, alleged that
a writ of execution might issue on the following day, and
asserted that a seizure of school property would cause irreparable injury to the School District and would violate the
petitioners' constitutional and statutory rights. The District
Court entered an order restraining all the defendants "from
attempting to assert jurisdiction over plaintiffs or issuing
writs of execution out of Cause No. Civ. 82-287 of the Crow
Tribal Court until this court orders otherwise."I
In subsequent proceedings, the petitioners filed an amendment to their complaint, invoking 28 U. S. C. § 1331 as a
basis for federal jurisdiction,2 and added Flora Not Afraid
and Leroy Sage as parties defendant. After the temporary
restraining order expired, a hearing was held on the defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint and on the plaintiffs'
motion for a preliminary injunction. On December 29, 1982,
the District Court granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction against any execution of the Tribal Court judgment.

Opinion of the Court

was that the Crow Tribal Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the tort that was the basis of the default judgment." Id., at 214.
A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 736 F. 2d 1320 (1984). Without reaching the
merits of petitioners' challenge to the jurisdiction of the
Tribal Court, the majority concluded that the District Court's

exercise of jurisdiction could not be supported on any constitutional, statutory, or common-law ground. Id., at 13221323.8 One judge dissented in part and concurred in the
result, expressing the opinion that petitioners stated a federal common-law cause of action involving a substantial
federal question over which subject-matter jurisdiction was
conferred by 28 U. S. C. § 1331. He concluded, however,
that the petitioners had a duty to exhaust their Tribal Court
remedies before invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court,
and therefore concurred in the judgment directing that the
complaint be dismissed. Id., at 1324-1326.1
3

The Court of Appeals believed that the petitioners' due process and
equal protection claims had no merit because Indian tribes are not constrained by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, although recognizing that the Tribe is bound by the Indian Civil Rights Act,
25 U. S. C. § 1301 et seq., the Court of Appeals held that a federal court
has no jurisdiction to enjoin violations of that Act. See Santa Clara
Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U. S.49 (1978). Finally, although the majority
assumed that a complaint alleging that a tribe had abused its regulatory
jurisdiction would state a claim arising under federal common law, it concluded that a claim that a tribe had abused its adjudicatory jurisdiction
could not be recognized because Congress, by enacting the Indian Civil
Rights Act, had specifically restricted federal court interference with tribal
court proceedings to review on petition for habeas corpus.
'After the District Court's injunction was vacated, tribal officials issued
a writ of execution on August 1, 1984, and seized computer terminals,
other computer equipment, and a truck from the School District. A sale of
the property was scheduled for August 22, 1984. On that date, the School
District appeared in the Tribal Court, attempting to enjoin the sale and to
set aside the default judgment. App. to Brief in Opposition la-9a. The

I
Section 1331 of the Judicial Code provides that a federal
district court "shall have original jurisdiction of all civil
actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of
the United States." 5 It is well settled that this statutory
grant of "jurisdiction will support claims founded upon federal common law as well as those of a statutory origin. '"6
Federal common law as articulated in rules that are fashioned7
by court decisions are "laws" as that term is used in § 1331.
Thus, in order to invoke a federal district court's jurisdiction under § 1331, it was not essential that the petitioners
base their claim on a federal statute or a provision of the
Constitution. It was, however, necessary to assert a claim
"arising under" federal law. As Justice Holmes wrote for
the Court, a "suit arises under the law that creates the cause
Tribal Court stated that it could not address the default-judgment issue
"without a full hearing, research, and briefs by counsel," id., at 4a; that it
would consider a proper motion to set aside the default judgment; and that
the sale should be postponed. Petitioners also proceeded before the Court
of Appeals, which denied an emergency motion to recall the mandate on
August 20, 1984. The next day JUSTICE REHNQUIST granted the petitioners' application for a temporary stay. On September 10, 1984, he continued the stay pending disposition of the petitioners' petition for certiorari.
469 U. S. 1032 (1984). On September 19, the Tribal Court entered an
order postponing a ruling on the motion to set aside the default judgment
until after final review by this Court. App. to Brief in Opposition 15a.
Subsequently, the Court of Appeals stayed all proceedings in the District
Court. On April 24, 1985, JUSTICE REHNQUIST denied an application to
"dissolve" the Court of Appeals' stay. Post, p. 1301.

of action."'I Petitioners contend that the right which they
assert-a right to be protected against an unlawful exercise
of Tribal Court judicial power-has its source in federal law
because federal law defines the outer boundaries of an Indian
tribe's power over non-Indians.
As we have often noted, Indian tribes occupy a unique
status under our law. 9 At one time they exercised virtually
unlimited power over their own members as well as those
who were permitted to join their communities. Today, however, the power of the Federal Government over the Indian
tribes is plenary.'0 Federal law, implemented by statute, by
treaty, by administrative regulations, and by judicial decisions, provides significant protection for the individual, territorial, and political rights of the Indian tribes. The tribes
also retain some of the inherent powers of the self-governing
political communities that were formed long before Europeans first settled in North America."
This Court has frequently been required to decide questions concerning the extent to which Indian tribes have retained the power to regulate the affairs of non-Indians.' 2 We

have also been confronted with a series of questions concerning the extent to which a tribe's power to engage in commerce has included an immunity from state taxation.1 In all
of these cases, the governing rule of decision has been provided by federal law. In this case the petitioners contend
that the Tribal Court has no power to enter a judgment
against them. Assuming that the power to resolve disputes
arising within the territory governed by the Tribe was once
an attribute of inherent tribal sovereignty, the petitioners, in
essence, contend that the Tribe has to some extent been
divested of this aspect of sovereignty. More particularly,
when they invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court under
§ 1331, they must contend that federal law has curtailed the
powers of the Tribe, and thus afforded them the basis for the
relief they seek in a federal forum.
The question whether an Indian tribe retains the power to
compel a non-Indian property owner to submit to the civil
jurisdiction of a tribal court is one that must be answered by
reference to federal law and is a "federal question" under
§ 1331.14 Because petitioners contend that federal law has

and the power to tax the sale of cigarettes to non-Indians, Washington v.
Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U. S. 134 (1980).
"aSee, e. g., Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U. S. 145 (1973);
cf. White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, supra.
14We have recognized that federal law has sometimes diminished the inherent power of Indian tribes in significant ways. As we stated in United
States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S., at 323-326:
"Their incorporation within the territory of the United States, and their
acceptance of its protection, necessarily divested them of some aspects of
the sovereignty which they had previously exercised.... In sum, Indian
tribes still possess those aspects of sovereignty not withdrawn by treaty or
statute, or by implication as a necessary result of their dependent status.
"The areas in which such implicit divestiture of sovereignty has been
held to have occurred are those involving the relations between an Indian
tribe and nonmembers of the tribe. Thus, Indian tribes can no longer
freely alienate to non-Indians the land they occupy. Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U. S. 661, 667-668; Johnson v. M'Intosh,

NATIONAL FARMERS UNION INS. COS. v. CROW TRIBE

Opinion of the Court

divested the Tribe of this aspect of sovereignty, it is federal
law on which they rely as a basis for the asserted right of
freedom from Tribal Court interference. They have, therefore, filed an action "arising under" federal law within the
meaning of § 1331. The District Court correctly concluded
that a federal court may determine under § 1331 whether a
tribal court has exceeded the lawful limits of its jurisdiction.
II
Respondents' contend that, even though the District
Court's jurisdiction was properly invoked under § 1331, the
Court of Appeals was correct in ordering that the complaint
be dismissed because the petitioners failed to exhaust their
remedies in the tribal judicial system. They further assert
that the underlying tort action "has turned into a procedural
and jurisdictional nightmare" because petitioners did not pursue their readily available Tribal Court remedies. Petitioners, in response, relying in part on Oliphant v. Suquamish
Indian Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), assert that resort to exhaustion as a matter of comity "is manifestly inappropriate."
In Oliphant we held that the Suquamish Indian Tribal
Court did not have criminal jurisdiction to try and to punish
non-Indians for offenses committed on the reservation.
That holding adopted the reasoning of early opinions of two
United States Attorneys General,' 5 and concluded that fed8 Wheat. 543, 574. They cannot enter into direct commercial or governmental relations with foreign nations. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515,
559; Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet., at 17-18; Fletcher v. Peck, 6
Cranch 87, 147 (Johnson, J., concurring). And, as we have recently held,
they cannot try nonmembers in tribal courts. Oliphant v. Siquamish
Indian Tribe [435 U. S. 191 (1978)]."

We stated:
"Faced by attempts of the Chocktaw Tribe to try non-Indian offenders in
the early 1800's the United States Attorneys General also concluded that
the Choctaws did not have criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians absent
congressional authority. See 2 Op. Atty. Gen. 693 (1834); 7 Op. Atty.
Gen. 174 (1855). According to the Attorney General in 1834, tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians is, inter alia, inconsistent with treaty

OCTOBER TERM, 1984
Opinion of the Court

471 U. S.

eral legislation conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts to

try non-Indians for offenses committed in Indian Country had
implicitly pre-empted tribal jurisdiction. We wrote:
"While Congress never expressly forbade Indian tribes
to impose criminal penalties on non-Indians, we now
make express our implicit conclusion of nearly a century
ago that Congress consistently believed this to be the
necessary result of its repeated legislative actions."
Id., at 204.
If we were to apply the Oliphant rule here, it is plain that
any exhaustion requirement would be completely foreclosed
because federal courts would always be the only forums for
civil actions against non-Indians. For several reasons, however, the reasoning of Oliphant does not apply to this case.
First, although Congress' decision to extend the criminal
jurisdiction of the federal courts to offenses committed by
non-Indians against Indians within Indian Country supported
the holding in Oliphant, there is no comparable legislation
granting the federal courts jurisdiction over civil disputes
between Indians and non-Indians that arise on an Indian
reservation. 6 Moreover, the opinion of one Attorney General on which we relied in Oliphant, specifically noted the
difference between civil and criminal jurisdiction. Speaking
of civil jurisdiction, Attorney General Cushing wrote:
"But there is no provision of treaty, and no statute,
which takes away from the Choctaws jurisdiction of a
case like this, a question of property strictly internal to
the Chocktaw nation; nor is there any written law which
provisions recognizing the sovereignty of the United States over the territory assigned to the Indian nation and the dependence of the Indians on the
United States." 435 U. S., at 198-199.
'IF. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 253 (1982) ("The development of principles governing civil jurisdiction in Indian Country has been
markedly different from the development of rules dealing with criminal
jurisdiction").

NATIONAL FARMERS UNION INS. COS. v. CROW TRIBE

Opinion of the Court

confers jurisdiction of such a case in any court of the
United States.
"The conclusion seems to me irresistible, not that such
questions are justiciable nowhere, but that they remain
subject to the local jurisdiction of the Chocktaws.

"Now, it is admitted on all hands ...

that Congress has
'paramount right to legislate in regard to this question,
in all its relations. It has legislated, in so far as it saw
fit, by taking jurisdictionin criminalmatters, and omitting to take jurisdiction in civil matters.... By all
possible rules of construction the inference is clear that
jurisdiction is left to the Choctaws themselves of civil
controversies arising strictly within the Chocktaw Nation." 7 Op. Atty. Gen. 175, 179-181 (1855) (emphasis
added). 17
Thus, we conclude that the answer to the question whether
a tribal court has the power to exercise civil subject-matter
jurisdiction over non-Indians in a case of this kind is not
automatically foreclosed, as an extension of Oliphant would
require.
Rather, the existence and extent of a tribal
court's jurisdiction will require a careful examination of tribal
sovereignty, the extent to which that sovereignty has been
7

A leading treatise on Indian law suggests strongly that Congress has
had a similar understanding:
"In the civil field, however, Congress has never enacted general legislation
to supply a federal or state forum for disputes between Indians and nonIndians in Indian country. Furthermore, although treaties between the
federal government and Indian tribes sometimes required tribes to surrender non-Indian criminal offenders to state or federal authorities, Indian
treaties did not contain provision for tribal relinquishment of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians." Id., at 253-254.
"8 Cf. Kennerly v. District Court of Montana, 400 U. S. 423 (1971); Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S.217 (1959).

altered, divested, or diminished,' as well as a detailed study
of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied
in treaties and elsewhere, and adminstrative or judicial
decisions.
We believe that examination should be conducted in the
first instance in the Tribal Court itself. Our cases have often
recognized that Congress is committed to a policy of supporting tribal self-government and self-determination." That
policy favors a rule that will provide the forum whose jurisdiction is being challenged the first opportunity to evaluate
the factual and legal bases for the challenge. 2 Moreover the
orderly administration of justice in the federal court will be
served by allowing a full record to be developed in the Tribal
Court before either the merits or any question concerning appropriate relief is addressed." The risks of the kind of "procedural nightmare" that has allegedly developed in this case
"9See, e. g., New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U. S. 324,
331-332 (1983); Merrion v. JicarillaApache Tribe, 455 U. S., at 137;

U. S. 535, 551 (1974); Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S., at 223.
21
We do not suggest that exhaustion would be required where an assertion of tribal jurisdiction "is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted
in bad faith," cf. Juidice v. Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 338 (1977), or where the
action is patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions, or where
exhaustion would be futile because of the lack of an adequate opportunity
to challenge the court's jurisdiction.
"Four days after receiving notice of the default judgment, petitioners
requested that the District Court enter an injunction. Crow Tribal Court
Rule of Civil Procedure 17(d) provides that a party in a default may move
to set aside the default judgment at any time within 30 days. App. 17.
Petitioners did not utilize this legal remedy. It is a fundamental principle
of long standing that a request for an injunction will not be granted as long
as an adequate remedy at law is available. See, e. g., Rondeau v. Mosinee
PaperCorp., 422 U. S. 49, 57 (1975); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 88
(1974).

Opinion of the Court

will be minimized if the federal court stays its hand until after
the Tribal Court has had a full opportunity to determine its
own jurisdiction" and to rectify any errors it may have
made.A Exhaustion of tribal court remedies, moreover, will
encourage tribal courts to explain to the parties the precise
basis for accepting jurisdiction, and will also provide other
courts with the benefit of their expertise in such matters in
the event of further judicial review.5
III
Our conclusions that § 1331 encompasses the federal question whether a tribal court has exceeded the lawful limits of
its jurisdiction, and that exhaustion is required before such a
claim may be entertained by a federal court, require that we
reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Until petitioners have exhausted the remedies available to them in the
Tribal Court system, n. 4, supra,it would be premature for a
federal court to consider any relief. Whether the federal action should be dismissed, or merely held in abeyance pending
the development of further Tribal Court proceedings, is a
question that should be addressed in the first instance by the
District Court. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT
No. 84-435.

Argued April 24, 1985-Decided June 3, 1985

Title 18 U. S. C. § 844(i) makes it a crime to maliciously damage or destroy, or attempt to damage or destroy, by means of fire or an explosive,
"any building ... used ... in any activity affecting interstate or foreign
commerce." Petitioner, who was earning rental income from a two-unit
apartment building and treated it as business property for tax purposes,
was convicted for violating § 844(i) after he unsuccessfully attempted to
set fire to the building, and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. Both
the District Court and the Court of Appeals rejected his contention that
the building was not commercial or business property, and therefore was
not capable of being the subject of an offense under § 844(i).
Held: Section 844(i) applies to petitioner's apartment building. The language of the statute expresses an intent by Congress to exercise its full
power under the Commerce Clause, and the legislative history indicates
that Congress at least intended to protect all "business property." The
rental of real estate is unquestionably an activity that affects commerce
for purposes of the statute, and the congressional power to regulate the
class of activities that constitute the rental market for real estate includes the power to regulate individual activity within that class, such as
the local rental of an apartment unit. Pp. 859-862.
738 F. 2d 825, affirmed.

ChristopherJ. Wright argued the cause pro hac vice for
the United States. With him on the brief were Solicitor

JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether 18 U. S. C. § 844(i) applies to a two-unit apartment building that is used as rental
property.
