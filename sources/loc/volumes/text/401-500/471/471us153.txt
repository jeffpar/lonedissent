MINTZES, WARDEN v. BUCHANON
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE SIXTH CIRCUIT
No. 84-501.

Decided April 15, 1985

Order granting certiorari vacated, and certiorari dismissed.
below: 734 F. 2d 274.

Reported

PER CURIAM.

The Court is advised that the respondent died in Ingham
County, Mich., on December 7, 1984. The Court's order
granting the writ of certiorari, see 469 U. S. 1033 (1984),
therefore is vacated, and the petition for certiorari is
dismissed. See Warden v. Palermo, 431 U. S. 911 (1977).
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE POWELL

took no part in the decision of this case.

dissenting.
In this case, the District Court and the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit ordered that respondent either be released or given a new hearing on the degree of his crimes and
a resentencing. This was ordered despite the passage of 25
years since respondent's convictions for two murders committed while he was a fugitive on escape from prison. Both
courts held that laches did not bar respondent's claim that he
did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel
at the hearing and sentencing in 1956. Understandably
troubled by the possible ramifications of such a drastic holding and concerned that even in this particular case it would be
prejudiced in its defense to the allegations, given the loss of
records, faded memories, and intervening deaths, the State
of Michigan sought certiorari to review the judgment of the
Court of Appeals. We granted the State's petition and set
the case for argument. 469 U. S. 1033 (1984).
