CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE FIFTH CIRCUIT

No. 73-1256.

Argued November 19, 1974-Decided June 2, 1975

Respondent union, representing the plumbing and mechanical trades
in Dallas, was a party to a multiemployer collective-bargaining
agreement with a mechanical contractors association. The agreement contained a "most favored nation" clause, by which the
union agreed that if it granted a more favorable contract to any
other employer it would extend the same terms to all association
members. Respondent picketed petitioner, a general building contractor which subcontracted all plumbing and mechanical work
and had no employees respondent wished to represent, to secure
a contract whereby petitioner agreed to subcontract such work
only to firms that had a current contract with respondent. Petitioner signed under protest and, claiming that the agreement
violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and state antitrust laws,
brought suit against respondent seeking declaratory and injunctive
relief. By the time this case went to trial, respondent had secured
identical agreements from other general contractors and was selectively picketing those who resisted. The District Court held
(1) that the subcontracting agreement was exempt from federal
antitrust laws because it was authorized by the first proviso in
§ 8 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which
exempts jobsite contracting agreements in the construction industry from the statutory ban on secondary agreements requiring
employers to cease doing business with other persons, and (2) that
federal labor legislation pre-empted the State's antitrust laws.
The Court of Appeals affirmed. Held:
1. Respondent union's agreement with petitioner is not entitled
to the nonstatutory exemption from the federal antitrust laws

because it imposed direct restraints on competition among subcontractors that would not have resulted from the elimination of
competition based on differences in wages and working conditions.
Pp. 621-626.
(a) The agreement indiscriminately excluded-nonunion subcontractors from a portion of the market, even if their competitive
advantages were derived from efficient operating methods rather
than substandard wages and working conditions. P. 623.
(b) The "most-favored nation" clause in the multiemployer
bargaining agreement, by insuring that no union subcontractor
would have a competitive advantage on any matters covered by
the agreement, gave respondent's agreements with petitioner and
other general contractors the effect of creating a sheltered market
for union subcontractors in that portion of the subcontracting
market controlled by signatory general contractors. Pp. 623-624.
(c) Since the agreement did not simply prohibit subcontracting to any nonunion firm but to any firm that did not have a
contract with respondent, it gave the union complete control over
subcontract work offered by general contractors that had signed
the agreement and empowered the union to exclude certain subcontractors from that portion of the market by refusing to deal
with them. Pp. 624-625.
2. The first proviso to § 8 (e) of the NLRA does not shelter
the challenged agreement from the federal antitrust laws, since
that proviso was not intended to authorize subcontracting agreements that are neither within the context of a collective-bargaining
relationship nor limited to any particular jobsite. Here respondent, which has never sought to represent petitioner's employees
or bargain with petitioner on their behalf, makes no claim to be
protecting those employees from working with nonunion men; the
agreement was not limited to any particular jobsite; and respondent concededly sought the agreement solely as a means of pressuring Dallas mechanical subcontractors to recognize it as their
employees' representative. Pp. 626-633.
3. There is no indication that Congress in the Taft-Hartley
amendments or later meant to make NLRA remedies for "hot
cargo" agreements exclusive, thus precluding liability for such
agreements under the antitrust acts. Pp. 633-634.

parties to the union's current collective-bargaining agreement. The union disclaimed any interest in representing
the general contractors' employees. In this case the
picketing succeeded, and petitioner seeks to annul the
resulting agreement as an illegal restraint on competition under federal and state law. The union claims

I
Local 100 is the bargaining representative for workers
in the plumbing and mechanical trades in Dallas. When
this litigation began, it was party to a multiemployer
bargaining agreement with the Mechanical Contractors
Association of Dallas, a group of about 75 mechanical
contractors. That contract contained a "most favored
nation" clause, by which the union agreed that if it
granted a more favorable contract to any other employer
it would extend the same terms to all members of the
Association.
Connell Construction Co. is a general building
contractor in Dallas. It obtains jobs by competitive
bidding and subcontracts all plumbing and mechanical
work. Connell has followed a policy of awarding these
subcontracts on the basis of competitive bids, and it has
done business with both union and nonunion subcontractors. Connell's employees are represented by various
building trade unions. Local 100 has never sought to
represent them or to bargain with Connell on their behalf.
In November 1970, Local 100 asked Connell to agree
that it would subcontract mechanical work only to firms
that had a current contract with the union. It demanded
that Connell sign the following agreement:
"WHEREAS, the contractor and the union are
engaged in the construction industry, and

OCTOBER TERM, 1974
Opinion of the Court

421 U. S.

"WHEREAS, the contractor and the union desire
to make an agreement applying in the event of subcontracting in accordance with Section 8 (e) of the
Labor-Management Relations Act;
"WHEREAS, it is understood that by this agreement the contractor does not grant, nor does the
union seek, recognition as the collective bargaining
representative of any employees of the signatory
contractor; and
"WHEREAS, it is further understood that the
subcontracting limitation provided herein applies
only to mechanical work which the contractor does
not perform with his own employees but uniformly
subcontracts to other firms;
"THEREFORE, the contractor and the union
mutually agree with respect to work falling within
the scope of this agreement that is to be done at
the site of construction, alteration, painting or
repair of any building, structure, or other works, that
[if] the contractor should contract or subcontract any
of the aforesaid work falling within the normal trade
jurisdiction of the union, said contractor shall contract or subcontract such work only to firms that
are parties to an executed, current collective bargaining agreement with Local Union 100 of the
United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices
of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry."
When Connell refused to sign this agreement, Local 100
stationed a single picket at one of Connell's major construction sites. About 150 workers walked off the job,
and construction halted. Connell filed suit in state
court to enjoin the picketing as a violation of Texas antitrust laws. Local 100 removed the case to federal court.
Connell then signed the subcontracting agreement under
protest. It amended its complaint to claim that the

Opinion of the Court

agreement violated §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26
Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 1 and 2, and was
therefore invalid. Connell sought a declaration to this
effect and an injunction against any further efforts to
force it to sign such an agreement.
By the time the case went to trial, Local 100 had submitted identical agreements to a number of other general
contractors in Dallas. Five others had signed, and the
union was waging a selective picketing campaign against
those who resisted.
The District Court held that the subcontracting agreement was exempt from federal antitrust laws because it
was authorized by the construction industry proviso to
§ 8 (e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 49 Stat. 452,
as added, 73 Stat. 543, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (e). The court
also held that federal labor legislation pre-empted the
State's antitrust laws. 78 L. R. R. M. 3012 (ND Tex.
1971). The Court of Appeals for. the Fifth Circuit affirmed, 483 F. 2d 1154 (1973), with one judge dissenting.
It held that Local 100's goal of organizing nonunion subcontractors was a legitimate union interest and that its
efforts toward that goal were therefore exempt from
federal antitrust laws. On the second issue, it held that
state law was pre-empted under San Diego Building
Trades Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 (1959). We
granted certiorari on Connell's petition. 416 U. S. 981
(1974). We reverse on the question of federal antitrust
immunity and affirm the ruling on state law pre-emption.
II
The basic sources of organized labor's exemption from
federal antitrust laws are § § 6 and 20 of the Clayton Act,
38 Stat. 731 and 738, 15 U. S. C. § 17 and 29 U. S. C. § 52,
and the Norris-La Guardia Act, 47 Stat. 70, 71, and 73,
29 U. S. C. §§ 104, 105, and 113. These statutes declare

OCTOBER TERM, 1974
Opinion of the Court

421 U. S.

that labor unions are not combinations or conspiracies
in restraint of trade, and exempt specific union activities,
including secondary picketing and boycotts, from the
operation of the antitrust laws. See United States v.
Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219 (1941).
They do not exempt concerted action or agreements between unions
and nonlabor parties. Mine Workers v. Pennington,381
U. S. 657, 662 (1965). The Court has recognized, however, that a proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargaining under the
NLRA and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some unionemployer agreements be accorded a limited nonstatutory
exemption from antitrust sanctions. Meat Cutters v.
Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676 (1965).
The nonstatutory exemption has its source in the
strong labor policy favoring the association of employees
to eliminate competition over wages and working conditions. Union success in organizing workers and standardizing wages ultimately will affect price competition
among employers, but the goals of federal labor law never
could be achieved if this effect on business competition
were held a violation of the antitrust laws. The Court
therefore has acknowledged that labor policy requires
tolerance for the lessening of business competition based
on differences in wages and working conditions. See
Mine Workers v. Pennington,supra, at 666; Jewel Tea,
supra, at 692-693 (opinion of WHITE, J.). Labor policy
clearly does not require, however, that a union have freedom to impose direct restraints on competition among
those who employ its members. Thus, while the statutory
exemption allows unions to accomplish some restraints
by acting unilaterally, e. g., Federation of Musicians v.
Carroll,391 U. S. 99 (1968), the nonstatutory exemption
offers no similar protection when a union and a nonlabor

party agree to restrain competition in a business market.
See Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U. S.
797, 806-811 (1945); Cox, Labor and the Antitrust
Laws-A Preliminary Analysis, 104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 252
(1955); Meltzer, Labor Unions, Collective Bargaining,
and the Antitrust Laws, 32 U. Chi. L. Rev. 659 (1965).
In this case Local 100 used direct restraints on the
business market to support its organizing campaign.
The agreements with Connell and other general contractors indiscriminately excluded nonunion subcontractors
from a portion of the market, even if their competitive
advantages were not derived from substandard wages and
working conditions but rather from more efficient operating methods. Curtailment of competition based on efficiency is neither a goal of federal labor policy nor a
necessary effect of the elimination of competition among
workers. Moreover, competition based on efficiency is a
positive value that the antitrust laws strive to protect.
The multiemployer bargaining agreement between
Local 100 and the Association, though not challenged in
this suit, is relevant in determining the effect that the
agreement between Local 100 and Connell would have
on the business market. The "most favored nation"
clause in the multiemployer agreement promised to eliminate competition between members of the Association
and any other subcontractors that Local 100 might organize. By giving members of the Association a contractual right to insist on terms as favorable as those
given any competitor, it guaranteed that the union would
make no agreement that would give an unaffiliated contractor a competitive advantage over members of the
Association.' Subcontractors in the Association thus
The primary effect of the agreement seems to have been to inlibit the union from offering any other employer a more favorable
contract. When asked at trial whether another subcontractor could

stood to benefit from any extension of Local 100's organization, but the method Local 100 chose also had the
effect of sheltering them from outside competition in that
portion of the market covered by subcontracting agreements between general contractors and Local 100. In
that portion of the market, the restriction on subcontracting would eliminate competition on all subjects
covered by the multiemployer agreement, even on subjects unrelated to wages, hours, and working conditions.
Success in exacting agreements from general contractors would also give Local 100 power to control access to
the market for mechanical subcontracting work. The
agreements with general contractors did not simply prohibit subcontracting to any nonunion firm; they prohibited subcontracting to any firm that did not have a
contract with Local 100. The union thus had complete
control over subcontract work offered by general contractors that had signed these agreements. Such control
could result in significant adverse effects on the market
and on consumers-effects unrelated to the union's legitimate goals of organizing workers and standardizing working conditions. For example, if the union thought the
interests of its members would be served by having
fewer subcontractors competing for the available work,

Opinion of the Court

it could refuse to sign collective-bargaining agreements
with marginal firms. Cf. Mine Workers v. Pennington,
supra. Or, since Local 100 has a well-defined geographical jurisdiction, it could exclude "traveling" subcontractors by refusing to deal with them. Local 100 thus might
be able to create a geographical enclave for local contractors, similar to the closed market in Allen Bradley,
supra.
This record contains no evidence that the union's goal
was anything other than organizing as many subcontractors as possible.2 This goal was legal, even though a
successful organizing campaign ultimately would reduce
the competition that unionized employers face from nonunion firms. But the methods the union chose are not
immune from antitrust sanctions simply because the goal
is legal. Here Local 100, by agreement with several contractors, made nonunion subcontractors ineligible to compete for a portion of the available work. This kind of
direct restraint on the business market has substantial
anticompetitive effects, both actual and potential, that
would not follow naturally from the elimination of competition over wages and working conditions. It contravenes antitrust policies to a degree not justified by
congressional labor policy, and therefore cannot claim a
nonstatutory exemption from the antitrust laws.
There can be no argument in this case, whatever its
force in other contexts, that a restraint of this magnitude

There was no evidence that Local 100's organizing campaign was

connected with any agreement with members of the multiemployer
bargaining unit, and the only evidence of agreement among those

subcontractors was the "most favored nation" clause in the collective-bargaining agreement. In fact, Connell has not argued the
case on a theory of conspiracy between the union and unionized
subcontractors. It has simply relied on the multiemployer agreement as a factor enhancing the restraint of trade implicit in the
subcontracting agreement it signed.

OCTOBER TERM, 1974

might be entitled to an antitrust exemption if it were
included in a lawful collective-bargaining agreement. Cf.
Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S., at 664-665;
Jewel Tea, 381 U. S., at 689-690 (opinion of WRITE, J.);
id., at 709-713, 732-733 (opinion of Goldberg, J.). In
this case, Local 100 had no interest in representing Connell's employees. The federal policy favoring collective
bargaining therefore can offer no shelter for the union's
coercive action against Connell or its campaign to exclude
nonunion firms from the subcontracting market.
III
Local 100 nonetheless contends that the kind of agreement it obtained from Connell is explicitly allowed by
the construction-industry proviso to § 8 (e) and that
antitrust policy therefore must defer to the NLIRA. The
majority in the Court of Appeals declined to decide this
issue, holding that it was subject to the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the NLRB. 483 F. 2d, at 1174. This Court
has held, however, that the federal courts may decide
labor law questions that emerge as collateral issues in
suits brought under independent federal remedies, including the antitrust laws.3 We conclude that § 8 (e)
does not allow this type of agreement.
Local 100's argument is straightforward: the first proviso to § 8 (e) allows "an agreement between a labor
organization and an employer in the construction industry relating to the contracting or subcontracting of
work to be done at the site of the construction, alteration,
painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other

no such limitation. This Court has held, however, that
§ 8 (e) must be interpreted in light of the statutory
setting and the circumstances surrounding its enactment:

the letter of the statute and yet not within the
statute, because not within its spirit, nor within the

Section 8 (e) was part of a legislative program designed
to plug technical loopholes in § 8 (b) (4)'s general prohibition of secondary activities. In § 8 (e) Congress
broadly proscribed using contractual agreements to
achieve the economic coercion prohibited by § 8 (b) (4).
See National Woodwork Mfrs. Assn., supra, at 634.
The provisos exempting the construction and garment industries were added by the Conference Committee

prohibited all "hot cargo" agreements, and the Senate
bill, which prohibited them only in the trucking
industry.
Although the garment-industry proviso
was supported by detailed explanations in both
Houses,' the construction-industry proviso was explained only by bare references to "the pattern of collec5 See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., 39-40

to have been adopted as a partial substitute for an attempt to overrule this Court's decision in NLRB v. Denver Building & Construction Trades Council, 341 U. S.

tractors at the jobsite. Congress limited the construction-industry proviso to that single situation, allowing
subcontracting agreements only in relation to work done
on a jobsite. In contrast to the latitude it provided in
the garment-industry proviso, Congress did not afford
construction unions an exemption from § 8 (b) (4) (B) or
otherwise indicate that they were free to use subcontracting agreements as a broad organizational weapon. In
keeping with these limitations, the Court has interpreted
the construction-industry proviso as
"~a measure designed to allow agreements pertaining
to certain secondary activities on the construction
site because of the close community of interests
there, but to ban secondary-objective agreements
concerning nonjobsite work, in which respect the
construction industry is no different from any other."

apparently was not designed to protect Local 100's members in that regard, since it was not limited to jobsites
on which they were working. Moreover, the subcontracting restriction applied only to the work Local 100's
members would perform themselves and allowed free subcontracting of all other work, thus leaving open a possibility that they would be employed alongside nonunion
subcontractors. Nor was Local 100 trying to organize
a nonunion subcontractor on the building project it
picketed.
The union admits that it sought the
agreement solely as a way of pressuring mechanical
subcontractors in the Dallas area to recognize it as the
representative of their employees.
If we agreed with Local 100 that the constructionindustry proviso authorizes subcontracting agreements
with "stranger" contractors, not limited to any particular jobsite, our ruling would give construction unions an
almost unlimited organizational weapon."0 The unions
10 Local 100 contends, unsoundly we think, that the NLRB has
decided this issue in its favor. It cites Los Angeles Building & Construction Trades Council (B & J Investment Co.), 214 N. L. R. B.
No. 86, 87 L. R. R. M. 1424 (1974), and a memorandum from the
General Counsel explaining his decision not to file unfair labor practice charges in a similar case, Plumbers Local 100 (Hagler Construction Co.), No. 16-CC-447 (May 1, 1974). In B & J Investment
the Board approved, without comment, an administrative
law judge's conclusion that the § 8 (e) proviso authorized a subcontracting agreement between the Council and a general contractor
who used none of his own employees in the particular construction
project. The agreement in question may have been a prehire con-

would be free to enlist any general contractor to bring
economic pressure on nonunion subcontractors, as long
as the agreement recited that it only covered work to be
performed on some jobsite somewhere. The proviso's
jobsite restriction then would serve only to prohibit
agreements relating to subcontractors that deliver their
work complete to the jobsite.
It is highly improbable that Congress intended such
a result. One of the major aims of the 1959 Act was
to limit "top-down" organizing campaigns, in which
unions used economic weapons to force recognition from
an employer regardless of the wishes of his employees.11
Congress accomplished this goal by enacting § 8 (b) (7),
which restricts primary recognitional picketing, and by
further tightening § 8 (b) (4) (B), which prohibits the
use of most secondary tactics in organizational campaigns. Construction unions are fully covered by these
sections. The only special consideration given them in
organizational campaigns is § 8 (f), which allows "prehire" agreements in the construction industry, but only
under careful safeguards preserving workers' rights to
decline union representation. The legislative history accompanying § 8 (f) also suggests that Congress may not
tract under § 8 (f), and it is not clear that the contractor argued
that it was invalid for lack of a collective-bargaining relationship.
The General Counsel's memorandum in Hagler Constructionis plainly
addressed to a different argument-that a subcontracting clause
should be allowed only if there is a pre-existing collective-bargaining
relationship with the general contractor or if the general contractor
has employees who perform the kind of work covered by the
agreement.

have intended that strikes or picketing could be used to
extract prehire agreements from unwilling employers."
These careful limits on the economic pressure unions
may use in aid of their organizational campaigns would
be undermined seriously if the proviso to §8 (e) were
construed to allow unions to seek subcontracting agreements, at large, from any general contractor vulnerable
to picketing. Absent a clear indication that Congress
intended to leave such a glaring loophole in its restrictions on "top-down" organizing, we are unwilling to
read the construction-industry proviso as broadly as
Local 100 suggests." Instead, we think its authorization
extends only to agreements in the context of collectivebargaining relationships and, in light of congressional
references to the Denver Building Trades problem, possibly to common-situs relationships on particular jobsites
as well.14
Finally, Local 100 contends that even if the subcontracting agreement is not sanctioned by the constructionH. R. Rep. No. 1147, supra, n. 5, at 42; 105 Cong. Rec. 10104

1 As noted above, supra, at 628-630, the garment-industry proviso
reflects different considerations. The text of the proviso and the
treatment in congressional debates and reports suggest that Congress
intended to authorize garment workers' unions to continue using
subcontracting agreements as an organizational weapon. See Danielson v. Joint Board, 494 F. 2d 1230 (CA2 1974) (Friendly, J.).
14 Connell also has argued that the subcontracting agreement was
subject to antitrust sanctions because the construction-industry
proviso authorizes only voluntary agreements. The foundation of
this argument is a contention that § 8 (b) (4) (B) forbids picketing
to secure an otherwise lawful "hot cargo" agreement in the construction industry. Because we hold that the agreement in this
case is outside the § 8 (e) proviso, it is unnecessary to consider
this alternative contention.

industry proviso and therefore is illegal under § 8 (e), it
cannot be the basis for antitrust liability because the
remedies in the NLRA are exclusive. This argument is
grounded in the legislative history of the 1947 TaftHartley amendments. Congress rejected attempts to
regulate secondary activities by repealing the antitrust
exemptions in the Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia Acts,
and created special remedies under the labor law instead.1 5 It made secondary activities unfair labor practices under § 8 (b) (4), and drafted special provisions for
preliminary injunctions at the suit of the NLRB and
for recovery of actual damages in the district courts.
§ 10 (1) of the NLRA, 49 Stat. 453, as added, 61 Stat.
149, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 160 (1), and § 303 of the
Labor Management Relations Act, 61 Stat. 158, as
amended, 29 U. S. C. § 187. But whatever significance
this legislative choice has for antitrust suits based on
those secondary activities prohibited by § 8 (b) (4), it
has no relevance to the question whether Congress
meant to preclude antitrust suits based on the "hot
cargo" agreements that it outlawed in 1959. There is
no legislative history in the 1959 Congress suggesting
that labor-law remedies for § 8 (e) violations were intended to be exclusive, or that Congress thought allowing antitrust remedies in cases like the present one
would be inconsistent with the remedial scheme of the
16
NLRA.
15 See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. (House Managers' statement), 65-67 (1947); 93 Cong. Rec. 4757, 4770, 48344874 (1947) (debates over Sen. Ball's proposal for antitrust sanctions and Sen. Taft's compromise proposal for actual damages, which
became § 303 of the NLRA).
16The dissenting opinion of MR. JusTicE STEWART argues that
§ 303 provides the exclusive remedy for violations of § 8 (e), thereby
precluding recourse to antitrust remedies. For that proposition the
dissenting opinion relies upon "considerable evidence in the legislative materials." Post, at 650. In our view, these materials are

CONNELL CO. v. PLUMBERS & STEAMFITTERS

635

Opinion of the Court

We therefore hold that this agreement, which is outside the context of a collective-bargaining relationship
and not restricted to a particular jobsite, but which
nonetheless obligates Connell to subcontract work only
to firms that have a contract with Local 100, may be the
basis of a federal antitrust suit because it has a potential
for restraining competition in the business market in
ways that would not follow naturally from elimination of
competition over wages and working conditions.
IV
Although we hold that the union's agreement with Connell is subject to the federal antitrust laws, it does not follow that state antitrust law may apply as well. The
Court has held repeatedly that federal law pre-empts state
remedies that interfere with federal labor policy or with
specific provisions of the NLRA. E. g., Motor Coach
Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274 (1971); Teamsters
v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964); Teamsters v. Oliver, 358
U. S. 283 (1959). 7 The use of state antitrust law to
unpersuasive. In the first place, Congress did not amend § 303 expressly to provide a remedy for violations of § 8 (e). See LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, §§ 704 (d),
(e), 73 Stat. 544-545. The House in 1959 did reject proposals
by Representatives Hiestand, Alger, and Hoffman to repeal labor's
antitrust immunity. Post, at 650-654. Those proposals, however,
were much broader than the issue in this case. The Hiestand-Alger
proposal would have repealed antitrust immunity for any action
in concert by two or more labor organizations. The Hoffman
proposal apparently intended to repeal labor's antitrust immunity
entirely. That the Congress rejected these extravagant proposals
hardly furnishes proof that it intended to extend labor's antitrust
immunity to include agreements with nonlabor parties, or that
it thought antitrust liability under the existing statutes would be

inconsistent with the NLRA. The bill introduced by Senator McClellan two years later provides even less support for that proposition. Like most bills introduced in Congress, it never reached a vote.

the parties with recourse only to the federal labor law, as enforced

regulate union activities in aid of organization must also
be pre-empted because it creates a substantial risk of conflict with policies central to federal labor law.
In this area, the accommodation between federal labor
and antitrust policy is delicate. Congress and this Court
have carefully tailored the antitrust statutes to avoid
conflict with the labor policy favoring lawful employee organization, not only by delineating exemptions from antitrust coverage but also by adjusting the scope of the antitrust remedies themselves. See Apex Hosiery Co. v.
Leader, 310 U. S. 469 (1940). State antitrust laws generally have not been subjected to this process of accommodation. If they take account of labor goals at all, they
may represent a totally different balance between labor
and antitrust policies. 8 Permitting state antitrust law to
operate in this field could frustrate the basic federal policies favoring employee organization and allowing elimination of competition among wage earners, and interfere
with the detailed system Congress has created for regulating organizational techniques.
by the NLRB. See Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S.
274 (1971); San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon, 359
U. S. 236 (1959). But in cases like this one, where there is an
independent federal remedy that is consistent with the NLRA,
the parties may have a choice of federal remedies. Cf. Vaca v.
Sipes, 386 U. S. 171, 176-188 (1967); Smith v. Evening News Assn.,
371 U. S. 195 (1962).
I8Texas law is a good example. Texas Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Arts.
5152 and 5153 (1971), declare that it is lawful for workers to associate
in unions and to induce other persons to accept or reject
employment. Article 5154, however, referring to the preceding
articles, provides: "Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal, affect
or diminish the force and effect of any statute now existing on the
subject of trusts, conspiracies against trade, pools and monopolies."
The Texas antitrust statutes prohibit, among other specified agreements, trusts, and monopolies, any combination of two or more
persons to restrict "the free pursuit of a lawful business." Tex. Bus.
& Comm. Code §§ 15.02-15.04 (1968).

CONNELL CO. v. PLUMBERS & STEAMFITTERS

Opinion of the Court

Because employee organization is central to federal
labor policy and regulation of organizational procedures
is comprehensive, federal law does not admit the use of
state antitrust law to regulate union activity that is
closely related to organizational goals. Of course, other
agreements between unions and nonlabor parties may
yet be subject to state antitrust laws. See Teamsters
v. Oliver, supra, at 295-297. The governing factor is the
risk of conflict with the NLRA or with federal labor
policy.
V
Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals
decided whether the agreement between Local 100 and
Connell, if subject to the antitrust laws, would constitute an agreement that restrains trade within the meaning of the Sherman Act. The issue was not briefed and
argued fully in this Court. Accordingly, we remand for
consideration whether the agreement violated the Sherman Act. 9
Reversed in part, affirmed in part, and remanded.
19In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment that the agree-

ment with Local 100 violated the antitrust laws, Connell sought a
permanent injunction against further picketing to coerce execution
of the contract in litigation. Connell obtained a temporary restraining order against the picketing on January 21, 1971, and thereafter executed the contract-under protest-with Local 100 on
March 28, 1971. So far as the record in this case reveals, there has
been no further picketing at Connell's construction sites. Accordingly, tlfere is no occasion for us to consider whether the NorrisLaGuardia Act forbids such an injunction where the specific agreement sought by the union is illegal, or to determine whether, within
the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, there was a "labor dispute" between these parties. If the Norris-LaGuardia Act were
applicable to this picketing, injunctive relief would not be available
under the antitrust laws. See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S.
219 (1941). If the agreement in question is held on remand to be

write to emphasize what is, for me, the determinative
feature of the case. Throughout this litigation, Connell
has maintained only that Local 100 coerced it into signing the subcontracting agreement. With the complaint so
drawn, I have no difficulty in concluding that the union's
conduct is regulated solely by the labor laws. The question of antitrust immunity would be far different, however, if it were alleged that Local 100 had conspired with
mechanical subcontractors to force nonunion subcontractors from the market by entering into exclusionary agreements with general contractors like Connell. An arrangement of that character was condemned in Allen
Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U. S. 797 (1945),
which held that Congress did not intend "to immunize
labor unions who aid and abet manufacturers and traders
in violating the Sherman Act," id., at 810. Were such a
conspiracy alleged, the multiemployer bargaining agreement between Local 100 and the mechanical subcontractors would unquestionably be relevant. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 673 (1965) (concurring
opinion); Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676,
737 (1965) (dissenting opinion). But since Connell has
never alleged or attempted to show any conspiracy between Local 100 and the subcontractors, I agree that
Connell's remedies, if any, are provided exclusively by
the labor laws.

engaged in peaceful picketing to induce the petitioner
Connell Construction Co., a general contractor in the
building and construction industry, to agree to subcontract plumbing and mechanical work at the construction
site only to firms that had signed a collective-bargaining
agreement with Local 100. None of Connell's own employees were members of Local 100, and the subcontracting agreement contained the union's express disavowal
of any intent to organize or represent them. The picketing at Connell's construction site was therefore secondary
activity, subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation pursuant to § 8 (b) (4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as added, 61 Stat. 141, 29 U. S. C. § 158
(b) (4), and § 303 of the Labor Management Relations
Act, 61 Stat. 158, as amended, 29 U. S. C. § 187. Similarly, the subcontracting agreement under which Connell
agreed to cease doing business with nonunion mechanical
contractors is governed by the provisions of § 8 (e) of
the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (e).
The relevant legislative history unmistakably demonstrates that in regulating secondary activity and 'lot
cargo" agreements in 1947 and 1959, Congress selected
with great care the sanctions to be imposed if proscribed
union activity should occur. In so doing, Congress
rejected efforts to give private parties injured by union
activity such as that engaged in by Local 100 the right
to seek relief under federal antitrust laws. Accordingly,
I would affirm the judgment before us.

with the carrier and to discharge the carrier from further
service. "That which Congress has recognized as lawful," the Court noted, "this Court has no constitutional

Woodwork Mfrs. Assn. v. NLRB, supra, at 623. The
central thrust of that statutory provision was to forbid

on Education and Labor explained in its report on the
Hartley bill:
"Illegal boycotts take many forms. . . . Sometimes they are direct restraints of trade, designed to
compel people against whom they are engaged in
to place their business with some other than those
they are dealing with at the time .... Under [§ 12],
these practices are called by their correct name,
'unlawful concerted activities.' It is provided that
any person injured in his person, property, or business by an unlawful concerted activity affecting
commerce may sue the person or persons responsible
for the injury in any district court having jurisdiction of the parties and recover damages. The bill
makes inapplicable in such suits the Norris-LaGuardia Act, which heretofore has protected parties to
industrial strife from the consequences of their lawlessness, no matter how violent their disputes became.

removal of antitrust immunity for prohibited secondary
activity, choosing instead to make the remedies available
under federal labor law exclusive. The Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare approved S.1126, 80th

conduct would be an unfair labor practice and could be
enjoined on application of the National Labor Relations

"The amendment, furthermore, removes the protection of the Clayton Act from monopoly agreements to fix prices, allocate customers, restrict
production, distribution, or competition, or impose
restrictions or conditions on the purchase, sale, or

Although stating that he personally agreed with the
changes proposed by Senator Ball, Senator Taft argued
for defeat of the Ball amendment, explaining that resistance to providing a private injunctive remedy in cases
of secondary boycotts was so strong that an attempt to
eliminate the labor exemption from the antitrust laws
would lead to the defeat of any effort to provide for a
private damages remedy for injured parties. Senator Taft
proposed as a substitute that private parties be given
only the right to sue for actual damages. 93 Cong. Rec.

amendment was thereafter defeated, 93 Cong. Rec. 4847,

the Board or by pursuing the newly created, exclusive

II
Contrary to the assertion in the Court's opinion, ante,
at 634, the deliberate congressional decision to make
§ 303 the exclusive private remedy for unlawful secondary
activity is clearly relevant to the question of Local 100's
antitrust liability in the case before us. The Court is
correct, of course, in noting that § 8 (e)'s prohibition of
"hot cargo" agreements was not added to the Act until
1959, and that § 303 was not then amended to cover
§ 8 (e) violations standing alone. But as part of the
1959 amendments designed to close "technical loopholes"
perceived in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress amended
§ 8 (b) (4) to make it an unfair labor practice for a labor
organization to threaten or coerce a neutral employer,
either directly or through his employees, where an object
of the secondary pressure is to force the employer to enter
into an agreement prohibited by § 8 (e).- At the same
dealing in the products of any other producer, processor, or manufacturer, or to cease doing business with any other person;
"(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by
reason o[f] any violation of subsection (a) may sue therefor in any
district court of the United States subject to the limitations and
provisions of section 301 hereof without respect to the amount in controversy, or in any other court having jurisdiction of the parties,
and shall recover the damages by him sustained and the cost of
the suit."

time, Congress expanded the scope of the § 303 damages
remedy to allow recovery of the actual damages sustained as a result of a union's engaging in secondary activity to force an employer to sign an agreement in violation
of § 8 (e).1 In short, Congress has provided an employer
like Connell with a fully effective private damages remedy
for the allegedly unlawful union conduct involved in this
case.

The essence of Connell's complaint is that it was
coerced by Local 100's picketing into "conspiring" with
the union by signing an agreement that limited its ability
73 Stat. 519, 542-543, now provides in part that it shall be an unfair
labor practice for a labor organization or its agents:
"(4) (i) to engage in, or to induce or encourage any individual
employed by any person engaged in commerce or in an industry
affecting commerce to engage in, a strike or a refusal in the course
of his employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities or to perform any services; or (ii) to threaten, coerce, or restrain
any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting com-

"(a) It shall be unlawful, for the purpose of this section only,
in an industry or activity affecting commerce, for any labor organization to engage in any activity or conduct defined as an unfair
labor practice in section 158 (b) (4) of this title.
"(b) Whoever shall be injured in his business or property by
reason o[f] any violation of subsection (a) of this section may sue
therefor in any district court of the United States subject to the limitations and provisions of section 185 of this title without respect to

to subcontract mechanical work on a competitive basis.,
If, as the Court today holds, the subcontracting agreement is not within the construction-industry proviso to

§ 8 (e), then Local 100's picketing to induce Connell to
sign the agreement constituted a § 8 (b) (4) unfair labor
practice, and was therefore also unlawful under § 303 (a),

29 U. S. C. § 187 (a).'

Accordingly, Connell has the

right to sue Local 100 for damages sustained as a result
'Indeed, Connell's original state-court complaint was filed before
Connell had signed any agreement with Local 100. -See ante, at 620.
At that point it was apparent that the primary reason for the lawsuit was Connell's request for an injunction to stop the union's
picketing.
8 If, contrary to the Court's conclusion, see ante, at 626-633, Congress intended what it said in the proviso to § 8 (e), then the subcontracting agreement is valid and, under the view of the Board and
those Courts of Appeals that have considered the question, Local 100's
picketing to obtain the agreement would also be lawful. See, e. g.,
Orange Belt District Council of Painters v. NLRB, 117 U. S. App.
D. C. 233, 236, 328 F. 2d 534, 537; Construction Laborers v.
NLRB, 323 F. 2d 422 (CA9); Northeastern Indiana Bldg. Trades
Council, 148 N. L. R. B. 854, enforcement denied on other grounds,
122 U. S. App. D. C. 220, 352 F. 2d 696. Connell would therefore
have neither a remedy under § 303 nor one with the Board.
It would seem necessarily to follow that conduct specifically
authorized by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act could
not by itself be the basis for federal antitrust liability, unless the
Court intends to return to the era when the judiciary frustrated congressional design by determining for itself "what public policy in
regard to the industrial struggle demands." Duplex Printing Press
Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See
United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219. In my view, however,
even if Local 100's conduct was unlawful, Connell may not seek to
invoke the sanctions of the antitrust laws. Accordingly, I find it
unnecessary to decide in this case whether the subcontracting agreement entered into by Connell and Local 100 is within the ambit of
the construction-industry proviso to § 8 (e), and if it is, whether it
was permissible for Local 100 to utilize peaceful picketing to induce
Connell to sign the agreement.

of Local 100's unlawful secondary activity pursuant to
§ 303 (b), 29 U. S. C. § 187 (b). Although "limited to
actual, compensatory damages," Teamsters v. Morton,
377 U. S., at 260, Connell would be entitled under
§ 303 to recover all damages to its business that resulted from the union's coercive conduct, including any
provable damage caused by Connell's inability to subcontract mechanical work to nonunion firms. Similarly,
any nonunion mechanical contractor who believes his
business has been harmed by Local 100's having coerced
Connell into signing the subcontracting agreement is
entitled to sue the union for compensatory damages; for
§ 303 broadly grants its damages action to "[wihoever
shall be injured in his business or property" by reason of
a labor organization's engaging in a § 8 (b) (4) unfair
labor practice.0
9 If Connell and Local 100 had entered into a purely voluntary
"hot cargo" agreement in violation of § 8 (e), an injured nonunion
mechanical subcontractor would have no § 303 remedy because the
union would not have engaged in any § 8 (b) (4) unfair labor practice.
The subcontractor, however, would still be able to seek the full
range of Board remedies available for a § 8 (e) unfair labor practice.
Moreover, if Connell had truly agreed to limit its subcontracting
without any coercion whatsoever on the part of Local 100, the
affected subcontractor might well have a valid antitrust claim on
the ground that Local 100 and Connell were engaged in the type of
conspiracy aimed at third parties with which this Court dealt in
Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers, 325 U. S. 797. At the very
least, an antitrust suit by an injured subcontractor under circumstances in which Congress had failed to provide any form of private
remedy for damage resulting from an illegal "hot cargo" agreement
would present a very different question from the one before us-a
question which it is not now necessary to answer. Cf. Meat Cutters
v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676, 708 n. 9 (opinion of Goldberg, J.).
On the other hand, the signatory of a purely voluntary agreement
that violates § 8 (e) is fully protected from any damage that might
result from the illegal "hot cargo" agreement by his ability simply to
ignore the contract provision that violates § 8 (e). If the union
should attempt to enforce the illicit "hot cargo" clause through any

Moreover, there is considerable evidence in the legislative materials indicating that in expanding the scope
of § 303 to include a remedy for secondary pressure
designed to force an employer to sign an illegal "hot
cargo" clause and in restricting the remedies for violation of § 8 (e) itself to those available from the Board,
Congress in 1959 made the same deliberate choice to
exclude antitrust remedies as was made by the 1947
Congress.
While the House was considering labor reform legislation in the summer of 1959, specific proposals were made
to apply the antitrust laws to labor unions. Representative Hiestand of California introduced a bill which
"would solve many of the problems attending unbridled
union power as it exists and operates in this country.
My proposal is in the nature of antitrust legislation,
applied to labor unions." 105 Cong. Rec. 12135,2 NLRB
Legislative History of the Labor-Management Reporting
and Disclosure Act of 1959, p. 1507 (hereinafter Leg.
Hist. of LMRDA). Representative Alger of Texas
joined in cosponsoring the legislation, stating that
"[u]nion monopoly power" manifests itself in "restrictive
trade practices such as price fixing, restrictions on use of
new processes and technological improvements, exclusion
of products for the market, and so forth ....
This bill
deals directly with [this aspect] of union monopoly
power." 105 Cong. Rec. 12136, 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA
1507. Representative Alger added the following explanation of the bill:
"Under the language of H. R. 8003 any attempt
form of coercion, the employer may then bring a § 303 damages suit
or may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. See 29
U. S. C. § 158 (b) (4) (B). Since § 8 (e) provides that any prohibited agreement is "unenforcible and void," any union effort to
invoke legal processes to compel the neutral employer to comply
with his purely voluntary agreement would obviously be unavailing.

by a union to induce an employer or a group of
employers to comply with a union demand which
would result in restrictive trade practices would be
unlawful, and an employer faced with such a demand
could seek legal remedies to restrain the union from
enforcing its demand. The consequent denial to
unions of the right to fix prices or impose other artificial market limitations would not in any way interfere with normal and legitimate union functions or
with their proper collective bargaining powers. They
would merely be placed on an equal footing with all
other groups in society as was the case during the
fifty years prior to the Hutcheson decision." 105

10 The legislative proceedings leading to the passage of the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (the LandrumGriffin Act), 73 Stat. 519, began in January 1959 when Senator John
Kennedy introduced S. 505, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. In March 1959
Senator Kennedy introduced S. 1555, incorporating 46 amendments
to S. 505 made by the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.
S. 1555, with various additional amendments, was approved by the
Senate on April 25, 1959, and sent to the House, where it was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor. On July 80,
1959, the House Committee favorably reported H. R. 8342, 86th
Cong., 1st Sess. One week earlier H. R. 8400 and H. R. 8401, identical bills, were introduced in the House by Representatives Landrum
and Griffin, respectively. The House voted on August 13, 1959, to
substitute the text of H. R. 8400 for the text of the House Committee bill, and the Landrum-Griffin bill was then inserted by the
House in S. 1555 in lieu of its provisions. The Conference made
several substantive changes in the Landrum-Griffin bill, which was
then passed by both the House and Senate and approved by the
President. See generally 1 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA vii-xi.

and "hot cargo" provisions were to be enforced solely
through the Board and by use of the § 303 damages
remedy. See 105 Cong. Rec. 14347-14348, 2 Leg. Hist.
of LMRDA 1522-1523. Recognizing this important difference, Representative Alger proposed to amend the
Landrum-Griffin bill by adding, as an additional title,
the antitrust provisions of H. R. 8003. 105 Cong. Rec.
15532-15533, 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1569. Representative Alger once again stated that his proposed
amendment would make it unlawful for an individual
local union to "[e]nter into any arrangement--voluntary or coerced-with any employer, groups of employers, or other unions which cause product boycotts, price
fixing, or other types of restrictive trade practices." 105
Cong. Rec. 15533, 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1569.
Representative Griffin responded to Representative Alger's proposed amendment by observing:
"[It] serves to point out that the substitute [the
Landrum-Griffin bill] is a minimum bill. It might
be well at this point to mention some provisions that
are not in it.
"There is no antitrust law provision in this bill.
"This is truly a minimum bill that a responsible
Congress should pass. I believe I speak for the
gentleman from Georgia [MR. LANDRUM], as well as
myself when I say that if amendments are offered
on the floor to add antitrust provisions or others that
have been mentioned, I, for one, will oppose them.
The gentleman from Georgia and I have tried to
balance delicately the provisions which we believe
should be in a bill at this time and which a majority
of this body could support." 105 Cong. Rec. 15535,

efforts to subject proscribed union activities to the antitrust laws and their sanctions. See, e. g., 105 Cong. Rec.
15853, 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1685 (amendment offered by Rep. Hoffman). The House then adopted the
Landrum-Griffin bill over protests that it "does not go
far enough, that it needs more teeth, and that more
teeth are going to come in the form of legislation to
bring labor union activities under the antitrust laws."
105 Cong. Rec. 15858, 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1690

The House-Senate Conferees made some substantive
changes in the language of the amendments to § 8 (b) (4),
and also added the construction- and garment-industry
provisos to § 8 (e). See generally Cox, The LandrumGriffin Amendments to the National Labor Relations Act,

nature of the sanctions authorized for violations of either
section by the House-passed Landrum-Griffin bill: An
injured party could either seek relief from the Board or
bring suit for damages under § 303 against unions that
violate the revised secondary-boycott prohibitions. No
provisions were made for exposing proscribed union secondary activity or "hot cargo" agreements to antitrust
liability. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 1147, 86th Cong., 1st

Indeed, two years after enactment of the LandrumGriffin Act, Senator McClellan, whose committee hearings into abuses caused by concentrated labor power had
played a major role in generating support for the 1959
labor reform legislation, together with five other Senators,
introduced a bill to provide antitrust sanctions for illegal
"hot cargo" agreements in the transportation industry,
despite the fact that such agreements were already expressly prohibited by § 8 (e)."z As it had in 1947 and
1959, however, Congress in 1961 rejected this effort to
subject illegal union secondary conduct to the sanctions
of the antitrust laws.
In sum, the legislative history of the 1947 and 1959
amendments and additions to national labor law clearly
demonstrates that Congress did not intend to restore
antitrust sanctions for secondary boycott activity such
as that engaged in by Local 100 in this case, but rather
should act today with full knowledge that passage of the LandrumGriffin bill will not solve every problem. The heart of the problem,
the very heart, is the sheer power in the hands of labor union leaders

due to their above-the-law status with respect to our antimonopoly
laws." 105 Cong. Rec. 18132; 2 Leg. Hist. of LMRDA 1719.

intended to subject such activity only to regulation under
the National Labor Relations Act and § 303 of the Labor
Management Relations Act. The judicial imposition of
"independent federal remedies" not intended by Congress, no less than the application of state law to union
conduct that is either protected or prohibited by federal
labor law, 13 threatens "to upset the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national
labor policy." Teamsters v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260.

Accordingly, the judgment before us should be affirmed.

federal labor law pre-empts the state law that Connell sought to
apply to Local 100's secondary activity in this case.
