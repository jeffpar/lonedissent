APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

No. 73-1157.

Decided June 3, 1974

State's appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1253 from a declaratory judgment of a three-judge District Court invalidating a state statute
dismissed for want of jurisdiction, since § 1253 does not authorize
appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief
alone.
Dismissed for want of jurisdiction; certiorari before judgment to
Court of Appeals denied.
PER CURIAM.

A three-judge District Court entered a declaratory
judgment holding unconstitutional a Florida statute,
Fla. Stat. Ann. §458.22 (3) (Supp. 1974-1975), which
forbids an abortion without the consent of the husband, if the woman is married, and if unmarried
and under the age of 18, without the consent of a parent.
Because it was anticipated that the State would
respect the declaratory judgment, the court declined
to issue an injunction against the enforcement of the
statute. The State of Florida appeals from the declaratory judgment invalidating the statute. The appeal
is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Title 28 U. S. C.
§ 1253, under which this appeal is sought to be taken,
does not authorize an appeal from the grant or denial of
declaratory relief alone. Gunn v. University Committee,
399 U. S. 383 (1970); Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427
(1970); Rockefeller v. Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn & Queens, Inc., Division of St. Mary's Hospital, 397
U. S. 820 (1970); see also Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113,
123 (1973). The declaratory judgment is appealable to
the Court of Appeals, and we are informed that an

appeal to that court has already been taken. It is suggested that we treat the statement of jurisdiction as a
petition for certiorari before judgment to the Court of
Appeals pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1). The petition for certiorari is denied.
