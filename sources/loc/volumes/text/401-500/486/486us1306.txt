486 U. S.

MORISON v. UNITED STATES
ON APPLICATION FOR CONTINUED RELEASE FROM DETENTION
No. A-896.

Decided June 2, 1988

Application for continued release from detention after conviction-on
charges of espionage and theft of Government property-pending consideration of a yet-to-be-filed petition for writ of certiorari is denied
because, under 18 U. S. C. § 3143(b), applicant Morison has not shown
that his appeal is "likely to result in reversal" with respect to all the
counts for which imprisonment was imposed.
Application denied.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST,

Circuit Justice.

Samuel Loring Morison was convicted in the District Court
of two counts each of espionage, in violation of 18 U. S. C.
§§ 793(d), (e), and theft of Government property, in violation
of 18 U. S. C. § 641. His conviction was affirmed on appeal
by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 844 F. 2d 1057 (1988), and he now asks that he be allowed to remain free on bond pending the consideration of his
yet-to-be-filed petition for writ of certiorari. The statutory
standard for determining whether a convicted defendant is
entitled to be released pending a certiorari petition is clearly
set out in 18 U. S. C. § 3143(b) (1982 ed., Supp. IV), and the
only real issue in this application is whether Morison's appeal
''raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result
in reversal, an order for a new trial, or a sentence that does
not include a term of imprisonment." I agree with the
courts below, however, that regardless of whether Morison
has raised a "substantial question" with respect to the propriety of his conviction under the Espionage Act, he has not
done so with respect to his conviction for theft of Government
property under § 641. Because Morison has not shown that
his appeal is "likely to result in reversal" with respect to all
the counts for which imprisonment was imposed, see United
