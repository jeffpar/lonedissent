DANIEL v. LOUISIANA
ON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF LOUISIANA

No. 74-5369.

Decided January 27, 1975

The decision in Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, wherein it was
held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require petit
juries to be selected from a source fairly representative of the
community and that such requirement is violated by the systematic exclusion of women from jury panels, is not to be applied
retroactively, as a matter of federal law, to convictions obtained
by juries empaneled prior to the date of that decision. DeStefano
v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631.
297 So. 2d 417, affirmed.
PER CURIAM.

Appellant Daniel was tried before a jury of the
Twenty-second Judicial District Court of Louisiana and
convicted of armed robbery on November 20, 1973. The
jury that tried appellant was selected from a venire
chosen in accordance with the procedures then provided
for in La. Const., Art. VII, ยง 41, and La. Code Crim. Proc.,
Art. 402. Appellant raised a timely motion to quash the
petit jury venire, contending that these procedures violated the Fourteenth -Amendment because they resulted
in the systematic exclusion of women from the petit
jury venire from which his jury was chosen. His motion
to quash was denied and this denial was affirmed on appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court. 297 So. 2d 417
(1974).
In Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 (1975), we held
that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments command
that petit juries must be selected from a source fairly
representative of the community. In this case, it is not
disputed that the jury venire from which appellant's
petit jury was chosen did not constitute a fair cross sec-

tion of the community. The question is whether our
decision in Taylor v. Louisiana is to be applied retroactively to other defendants whose opportunity to raise a
timely objection to the jury-selection procedures had
passed as of the date of our decision in Taylor. We hold
that Taylor is not to be applied retroactively, as a matter
of federal law, to convictions obtained by juries empaneled prior to the date of that decision.
As we stated in Taylor v. Louisiana,supra, at 535-536,
"until today no case had squarely held that the exclusion
of women from jury venires deprives a criminal defendant
of his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial
jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community."
Given this statement, as well as the doctrinal underpinnings of the decision in Taylor, the question of the retroactive application of Taylor is clearly controlled by our
decision in DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968),
where we held Duncanv. Louisiana,391 U. S. 145 (1968),
to be applicable only prospectively. The three relevant
factors, as identified in Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293,
297 (1967), are
"(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards,
(b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement
authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on
the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards."
In Taylor, as in Duncan, we were concerned generally
with the function played by the jury in our system of
criminal justice, more specifically the function of preventing arbitrariness and repression. In Taylor, as in
Duncan, our decision did not rest on the premise that
every criminal trial, or any particular trial, was necessarily unfair because it was not conducted in accordance
with what we determined to be the requirements of the
Sixth Amendment. In Taylor, as in Duncan, the reli-

ance of law enforcement officials and state legislatures
on prior decisions of this Court, such as Hoyt v. Florida,
368 U. S. 57 (1961), in structuring their criminal justice
systems is clear. Here, as in Duncan,the requirement of
retrying a significant number of persons were Taylor to
be held retroactive would do little, if anything, to vindicate the Sixth Amendment interest at stake and would
have a substantial impact on the administration of criminal justice in Louisiana and in other States whose past
procedures have not produced jury venires that comport
with the requirement enunciated in Taylor.
The judgment is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
MR. JuSTICE DOUGLAS,

dissenting.

The decision in Taylor v. Louisiana was applied retroactively to the trial and conviction in that case, not
prospectively.
I see no equities that permit retroactivity of the new ruling in Taylor and that disallow it
here. My view has been that we should make our constitutional ruling retroactive in all cases if we make it
retroactive in one. We can never know what differences,
if any, would have resulted if a trial had been held
pursuant to constitutional standards of procedural due
process. I have recorded my dissents in other like situations, e. g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U. S. 293, 302-303; Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 640; Johnson v. New
Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 736; Whisman v. Georgia,384 U. S.
895.* When Mirandav. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, was decided we applied its ruling to three other cases in which

we also granted certiorari, id., at 499. We had held
40 additional cases raising the same point; and when
Mirandawas decided we denied certiorari in each of them,
384 U. S. 1020-1025. I dissented from these denials
saying:
"MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS is of the opinion that certiorari should be granted in these cases and the
judgments below reversed. He would remand the
cases for a new trial, it being clear from the records
that the principles announced in Mirandav. Arizona,
ante, p. 436, were not applied, lie sees no reason
for discriminating against these petitioners, all of
these cases having come here on direct review and
being of the same vintage as Miranda v. Arizona."
Id., at 1020-1021.
Here, as in the case of Miranda, it is largely chance
that we take for review one of several or many cases presenting the same issue. It is, I think, highly unfair to
make the opinion in the case we take retroactive in that
appellant's case but not retroactive in others of the same
vintage and pending here. If we sought equal justice for
all we would either make all of our constitutional decisions retroactive or all of them prospective only.
