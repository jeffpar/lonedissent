Per Curiam

cuit that the Secretary unlawfully rejected a California Medicaid plan amendment because an internal agency manual
stating approval of the type of provision in question was a
binding regulation, and because acceptance of the amendment was required by § 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act
of 1984, Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 1112, note following 42
U. S. C. § 1396a (1982 ed., Supp. III). Cubanski v. Heckler, 781 F. 2d 1421 (1986).
After the case had been briefed
and argued, Congress enacted § 4106 of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330,
which required the Secretary to approve the proposed California amendment, retroactively to the date of its proposal.
The Secretary has complied with that requirement.
The parties agree that these developments have rendered
the controversy moot. In accordance with our established
practice, we vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand with instructions to dismiss the suit. See Deakins v.
Monaghan, 484 U. S. 193, 200, 204 (1988); United States v.
Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39-40 (1950).
It is so ordered.
