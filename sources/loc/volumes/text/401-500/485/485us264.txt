HAIG

ET AL.

v. BISSONETTE

485 U. S.

ET AL.

CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT
No. 86-987. Decided March 21, 1988
800 F. 2d 812, affirmed for absence of quorum.
PER CURIAM.

Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U. S. C. § 1, and
since a majority of the qualified Justices are of the opinion
that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next
Term of the Court, the judgment of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is affirmed under 28
U. S. C. §2109, which provides that under these circumstances the Court shall enter its order affirming the judgment of the court from which the case was brought for review
with the same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided
Court.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O'CONNOR, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in this decision.
