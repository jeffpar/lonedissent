STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT

No. 72-6011.

Decided May 7, 1973

Reinstatement, unopposed by Solicitor Geneial, of in forma pauperis
appeal that had been dismissed for failfire to pay filing fee, directed
in exercise of Court's supervisory powers.
*Certiorari granted; vacated and remanded.

PER CURIAM.

Petitioner was convicted in United States District
Court of illegal wiretapping under 18 U. S. C. ยง2511.
His appeal was dismissed for want of timely prosecution
when he failed to pay a $25 filing fee. Petitioner contends that he thought payment of the fee unnecessary
because he had been granted leave to appeal in.'jorma
pauperis by the District Judge.
In his memorandum before this Court, the Solicitor
General states that the United States does not oppose a
remand to reinstate the ap-eal in the exercise of this
Court's supervisory powers in order to avoid possible in-.
justice and the possibility of collateral attack upon the
conviction. In light of this representation, and upon
our independent examination of the record, the motion
for leave to proceed in forma pauperis And the petition
for certiorari are granted and the case is vacated and
remanded with instructions that the appeal be reinstated.
It is so ordered.
