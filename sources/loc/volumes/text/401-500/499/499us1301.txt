OPINION OF INDIVIDUAL JUSTICE
IN CHAMBERS

COLE v. TEXAS
ON APPLICATION FOR STAY OF EXECUTION OF SENTENCE OF
DEATH

No. A-704 (90-7411).

Decided March 18, 1991

JUSTICE SCALIA will, in this and every capital case on direct review, grant
an application for a stay of execution pending disposition of a timely petition for writ of certiorari.

Circuit Justice.
I have before me an application for a stay of execution
pending disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the
Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. The petitioner seeks
direct review of the judgment of the Texas courts affirming
his death sentence.
I will in this case, and in every capital case on direct review, grant a stay of execution pending disposition by this
Court of the petition for certiorari. While I will not extend
the time for filing a petition beyond an established execution
date, see Madden v. Texas, 498 U. S. 1301 (1991) (SCALIA,
J., in chambers), neither will I permit the State's execution
date to interfere with the orderly processing of a petition on
direct review by this Court.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE SCALIA,
