v. BALLARD
APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

No. 73-776.

Argued October 15, 1974-Decided January 15, 1975

Appellee, a naval officer with more than nine years of active service,
who failed for a second time to be selected for promotion and
thus under 10 U. S. C. § 6382 (a) was subject to mandatory
discharge, brought this action claiming that application of that
statute to him when compared to 10 U. S. C. § 6401 (under which
had he been a woman officer he would have been entitled to
13 years of commissioned service before a mandatory discharge
for want of promotion) was an unconstitutional discrimination
based on sex in violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process
Clause. A three-judge District Court, relying on Frontiero v.
Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, concluded that the challenged mandatory-discharge provisions are supported solely by considerations
of fiscal and administrative policy, and upheld appellee's claim.
Held: The challenged legislative classification is completely rational
and does not violate the Due Process Clause. Pp. 505-510.
(a) The different treatment of men and women naval officers
under §§ 6382 and 6401 results, not from mere administrative or
fiscal convenience, but from the fact that female line officers
because of restrictions on their participating in combat and most
sea duty do not have opportunities for professional service equal
to those of male line officers, and Congress could rationally conclude that a longer period of tenure for women officers comported
with the goal of providing women officers with "fair and equitable
career advancement programs." Frontiero v. Richardson, supra;
Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, distinguished. Pp. 505-508.
(b) In naval corps where male and female officers are similarly
situated Congress made no tenure distinctions, thus underscoring
the rationality of the legislative classification. P. 509.
(c) The challenged statutes further a flow of promotions commensurate with the Navy's current needs and serve to motivate
qualified commissioned officers so to conduct themselves that they
may realistically anticipate higher command levels. P. 510.
360 F. Supp. 643, reversed.

Court.
Appellee Robert C. Ballard is a lieutenant in the
United States Navy. After more than nine years of
active service as a commissioned officer, he failed, for a
second time, to be selected for promotion to the grade of
lieutenant commander, and was therefore subject to mandatory discharge under 10 U. S. C. § 6382 (a).- He
"Title 10 U. S. C. § 6382 provides:
"(a) Each officer on the active list of the Navy serving in the
grade of lieutenant, except an officer in the Nurse Corps, and each
officer on the active list of the Marine Corps serving in the grade
of captain shall be honorably discharged on June 30 of the fiscal year
in which he is considered as having failed of selection for promotion
to the grade of lieutenant commander or major for the second time.
However, if he so requests, he may be honorably discharged at any
time during that fiscal year.
"(d) This section does not apply to women officers appointed
under section 5590 of this title or to officers designated for limited
duty."
Ballard's scheduled discharge carried with it an entitlement to a
"lump-sum" severance payment of approxdmately $15,000, 10 U. S. C.
§ 6382 (c), but would have terminated Ballard's total service time

brought suit in federal court claiming that if he had been
a woman officer, he would have been subject to a different separation statute, 10 U. S. C. § 6401, under which
he would have been entitled to 13 years of commissioned
service before a mandatory discharge for want of promotion.' He claimed that the application of § 6382 to him,
when compared with the treatment of women officers
subject to § 6401, was an unconstitutional discrimination
based on sex in violation of the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment.3
The District Judge issued a temporary restraining order
prohibiting Ballard's discharge. Subsequently, a threejudge District Court was convened to hear the claim pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §§ 2282, 2284. After hearings upon
motions by the Government defendants, that court issued
a preliminary injunction against Ballard's discharge.
(including seven years of enlisted service) short of the 20 years of
service necessary for substantially greater retirement benefits.
2 Title 10 U. S. C. § 6401 (a) provides:
"Each woman officer on the active list of the Navy, appointed
under section 5590 of this title, who holds a permanent appointment
in the grade of lieutenant and each woman officer on the active list
of the Marine Corps who holds a permanent appointment in the
grade of captain shall be honorably discharged on June 30 of the
fiscal year in which"(1) she is not on a promotion list; and
"(2) she has completed 13 years of active commissioned service
in the Navy or in the Marine Corps.
"However, if she so requests, she may be honorably discharged at any
time during that fiscal year."
3 The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States
provides in pertinent part that no person shall "be deprived of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law." Although it contains no Equal Protection Clause as does the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause prohibits the
Federal Government from engaging in discrimination that is "so
unjustifiable as to be violative of due process." Bolling v. Sharpe,
347 U. S. 497, 499. See also Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U. S.163, 168.

350 F. Supp. 167. Thereafter, the case came before the
three-judge court for decision on the merits. Relying
upon Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, and concluding that the challenged mandatory-discharge provisions are supported solely by considerations of fiscal
and administrative policy, the court held that § 6382 is
unconstitutional because the 13-year tenure provision of
§ 6401 discriminates in favor of women without sufficient
justification. 360 F. Supp. 643. Accordingly, the court
enjoined the Navy from discharging Ballard for failure
to be promoted to the grade of lieutenant commander
before the expiration of 13 years of commissioned service.

28 U. S. C. § 1253.
I
At the base of the system governing the promotion and
attrition of male line officers in the Navy is a congressional designation of the authorized number of the Navy's
enlisted personnel, 10 U. S. C. § 5401, and a correlative
limitation upon the number of active line officers as a
percentage of that figure. § 5403.4 Congress has also
established the ratio of distribution of line officers in the
several grades above lieutenant in fixed proportions to
the total number of line officers. §§ 5442, 5447 (a).
The Secretary of the Navy is required periodically to
convene selection boards to consider and recommend for
promotion male line officers in each of the separate ranks,
§ 5701, and must provide the boards so convened with
the number of male line officers that may be recom4 Similarly, the authorized strength of the Supply Corps and the
Civil Engineers Corps is established in set proportions to the authorized number of line officers. 10 U. S. C. § 5404 (a). More complicated formulas set the bounds for the numbers of staff officers in

other corps. E. g., § 5404 (b).

mended for promotion to the next higher grade. § 5756.
Eligible officers are then recommended for promotion by
the selection boards, based upon merit, and are placed
on a promotion list and promoted in due course as vacancies occur in the higher ranks. § 5769. Because the
number of lieutenant commanders is set by statute, the
number of lieutenants, like Ballard, who may be recommended for promotion and placed on a promotion list in
any year depends upon the number of vacancies existing
and estimated for the coming year in the rank of lieutenant commander. § 5756.
Wholly separate promotion lines are established for
the various categories of officers. Thus, in addition to
the selection boards that are convened to review the
promotion of male line officers, different selection boards
are convened to recommend for promotion staff corps
officers (except for women officers appointed under
§5590), § 5702, male officers in the Marine Corps,
§ 5703, women line officers, § 5704 (a), and women staff
officers who are appointed under § 5590. § 5704 (b).
The convening of these separate selection boards permits
naval officers within each category to be considered for
promotion in comparison with other officers with similar
opportunities and experience.
Because the Navy has a pyramidal organizational
structure, fewer officers are needed at each higher rank
than are needed in the rank below. In the absence of
some mandatory attrition of naval officers, the result
would be stagnation of promotion of younger officers and
disincentive to naval service. If the officers who failed
to be promoted remained in the service, the promotion
of younger officers through the ranks would be retarded.
Accordingly, a basic "up or out" philosophy was developed to maintain effective leadership by heightening
competition for the higher ranks while providing junior

Opinion of the Court

officers with incentive and opportunity for promotion. It
is for this reason, and not merely because of administrative
or fiscal policy considerations, that § 6382 (a) requires
that lieutenants be discharged when they are "considered
as having failed of selection for promotion to the grade
of lieutenant commander . . . for the second time."
Similar selection-out rules apply to officers in different
ranks who are twice passed over for promotion.'
The phrase "failed of selection for promotion" in
§ 6382 (a) is a statutory term of art. It does not embrace all eligible officers who have been considered and
not selected for promotion. Before an officer is considered to have failed of selection for the first time, he
must have been placed within a "promotion zone" established by the Secretary of the Navy. The Secretary each
year establishes "promotion zones" of officers who will
either be selected for promotion to the next higher grade
or who will be considered to have failed of selection for
promotion for the first time. See §§ 5764, 5776.
The number of officers in the zones, established
for each grade, is set at a.level to ensure a flow of promotions consistent with the appropriate terms of service in
each grade, see § 5768, and to provide opportunity for
promotion of others in succeeding years. The number
5See S. Rep. No. 2120, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 4. Parts of
the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 that affected naval officers were
codified in 10 U. S. C. § 5401 et seq., by the Act of Aug. 10, 1956,
70A Stat. 297. Title 10 U. S. C. § 6382 (a) is a codification of § 312 (h)
of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 860, and that section
was based, in turn, on § 12 (c) of the Act of June 23, 1938, 52
Stat. 949.
Title 10 U. S. C. § 6382 (b) calls for the mandatory discharge of
lieutenants (junior grade) who twice fail to be selected for promotion to the grade of lieutenant. In the grades above lieutenant,
statutory provisions require the mandatory retirement, instead of
discharge, of officers twice passed over for promotion. 10 U. S. C.
§§ 6376, 6379, 6380.

of officers within each zone is thus based on "a consideration of the number of vacancies estimated for the next
higher grade in each of the next five years, the number
of officers who will be eligible for selection in each of
those years, and the terms of service that those officers
will have completed." § 5764 (a).
Section 6401 is the mandatory-attrition provision that
applies to women officers appointed under § 5590, including all women line officers and most women officers in the Staff Corps. 7 It provides for mandatory
discharge of a woman officer appointed under § 5590
when she "is not on a promotion list" I and "has completed 13 years of active commissioned service in the
Navy."
§ 6401.
Section 6401 was initially intended approximately to equate the length of service
of women officers before mandatory discharge for want
of promotion with that of male lieutenants discharged
under § 6382 (a)." Subsequently, however, Congress
7 Section 6401 does not apply to women officers, appointed pursuant to 10 U. S. C. §§ 5574, 5578, 5578a, and 5579, who are in
the Medical, Dental, Judge Advocate General's, and Medical Service
Corps. These women staff officers are, like male officers, subject
to § 6382 (a).
8 The reason for the "not on a promotion list" language of § 6401,
as contrasted with the "failed of selection" language of § 6382 (a),
is in part historical. Section 6401 was enacted as § 207 (j) of the
Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, 62 Stat. 368.
The "promotion zone" system was not established for women
appointed under § 5590 until 1967. Pub. L. 90-130, 81 Stat. 374
(1967). See § 5764 (d).
9See Hearings on S. 1527 before the Senate Committee on
Armed Services (subsequently S. 1641), 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 39.
Although the statutory eligibility periods for promotion through
the ranks to lieutenant commander is somewhat shorter, § 5751 (b),
the normal time in service as an ensign, lieutenant (junior grade),
and lieutenant is 12 years under peacetime conditions. § 5768 (a).
Accordingly, a male line officer who had achieved the rank of lieutenant would typically have completed 12 years of service before

Opinion of the Court

specifically recognized that the provisions of § 6401 would
probably result in longer tenure for women lieutenants
than for male lieutenants under § 6382. When it enacted
legislation eliminating many of the former restrictions on
women officers' participation in the naval service in
1967,10 Congress expressly left undisturbed the 13-year
tenure provision of § 6401. And both the House and the
Senate Reports observed that the attrition provisions governing women line officers would parallel "present provisions with respect to male officers except that the discharge of male officers probably occurs about 2 years
earlier." S. Rep. No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 12; H. R.
Rep. No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 17 (emphasis

It is against this background that we must decide
whether, agreeably to the Due Process Clause of the
being considered for the rank of lieutenant commander, and would
have completed 13 years of service before being passed over twice
for promotion to the grade of lieutenant, commander.
'0 See Pub. L. 90-130, 81 Stat. 374 (1967). This Act repealed
numerical and percentage restrictions on women officers in certain
grades, removed restrictions on permanent appointment of women offi-

cers to the rank of captain, and authorized women officers under certain
circumstances to be eligible for flag rank. Congress also established
a "promotion zone" system for women officers and indicated that
the promotion and attrition of female officers were generally to
correspond to the treatment of male officers. S. Rep. No. 676, 90th
Cong., 1st Sess., 2.
"IAccording to the brief of the Solicitor General, the tenure differen-

tial has since been increased by the removal of time-in-grade restrictions and accelerated promotions resulting from the Vietnam conflict.
See Exec. Order No. 11437, Dec. 2, 1968, 3 CFR 754 (1966-1970
Comp.). Thus in recent years the discharge of male officers under
§ 63S2 (a) may have occurred about four years earlier than the
discharge of women officers under § 6401, instead of the two years'
difference acknowledged by Congress in 1967.

OCTOBER TERM, 1974
Opinion of the Court

419 U.S.

Fifth Amendment, the Congress may accord to women
naval officers a 13-year tenure of commissioned service
under § 6401 before mandatory discharge for want of
promotion, while requiring under § 6382 (a) the mandatory discharge of male lieutenants who have been twice
passed over for promotion but who, like Ballard, may
have had less than 13 years of commissioned service. In
arguing that Congress has acted unconstitutionally,
appellee relies primarily upon the Court's recent decisions
in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, and Reed v.
Reed, 404 U. S. 71.
In Frontiero the Court was concerned with "the
right of a female member of the uniformed services
to claim her spouse as a 'dependent' for the purposes
of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits under 37 U. S. C. §§ 401, 403,
and 10 U. S. C. §§ 1072, 1076, on an equal footing
with male members." 411 U. S., at 678. Under the
governing statutes, a serviceman could automatically
claim his spouse as a "dependent," but a servicewoman's
male spouse was not considered to be a "dependent" unless
he was shown in fact to be dependent upon his wife for
more than one-half of his support. The challenged classification was based exclusively on gender, and the Government conceded that the different treatment of men and
women service members was based solely upon considerations of administrative convenience. The Court found
this disparity of treatment constitutionally invalid. In
the words of the plurality opinion:
"[A]ny statutory scheme which draws a sharp
line between the sexes, solely for the purpose of
achieving administrative convenience, necessarily
commands 'dissimilar treatment for men and women
who are . . . similarly situated,' and therefore
involves the 'very kind of arbitrary legislative

Opinion of the Court

choice forbidden by the [Constitution] .... ' Reed
v. Reed, 404 U. S., at 77, 76. We therefore conclude
that, by according differential treatment to male and
female members of the uniformed services for the
sole purpose of achieving administrative convenience, the challenged statutes violate the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as they
require a female member to prove the dependency
of her husband." Id., at 690-691.
The case of Reed v. Reed, supra, involved quite
similar considerations. In that case the Court considered the constitutionality of an Idaho probate code provision that, in establishing who would administer a
decedent's estate, gave a "mandatory" preference to men
over women when they were in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The Idaho law permitted no
consideration of the individual qualifications of particular
men or women as potential administrators, but simply
preferred males in order to reduce probate expenses by
eliminating contests over the relative qualifications of
men and women otherwise similarly situated. The
Court held that "[bly providing dissimilar treatment for
men and women who are thus similarly situated, the
challenged section violates the Equal Protection Clause."
404 U. S., at 77.
In both Reed and Frontiero the challenged classifications based on sex were premised on overbroad generalizations that could not be tolerated under the Constitution.
In Reed, the assumption underlying the Idaho statute
was that men would generally be better estate administrators than women. In Frontiero, the assumption
underlying the Federal Armed Services benefit statutes
was that female spouses of servicemen would normally
be dependent upon their husbands, while male spouses
of servicewomen would not.

OCTOBER TERM, 1974
Opinion of the Court

419 U. S.

In contrast, the different treatment of men and women
naval officers under §§ 6382 and 6401 reflects, not archaic
and overbroad generalizations, but, instead, the demonstrable fact that male and female line officers in the Navy
are not similarly situated with respect to opportunities
for professional service. Appellee has not challenged
the current restrictions on women officers' participation
in combat and in most sea duty. Specifically, "women
may not be assigned to duty in aircraft that are engaged
in combat missions nor may they be assigned to duty on
vessels of the Navy other than hospital ships and transports." 10 U. S. C. § 6015. Thus, in competing for
promotion, female lieutenants will not generally have
compiled records of seagoing service comparable to those
of male lieutenants. In enacting and retaining § 6401,
Congress may thus quite rationally have believed that
women line officers had less opportunity for promotion
than did their male counterparts, and that a longer period
of tenure for women officers would, therefore, be consistent
with the goal to provide women officers with "fair and
equitable career advancement programs." H. R. Rep.
No. 216, supra, at 5. Cf. Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351.12
'12The dissenting

opinion argues that, in retaining § 6401 in
1967, Congress may not have intended to give a longer tenure to
women line officers than to their male counterparts, because "it is
certainly plausible to conclude that Congress continued to believe, as it
had in 1948, that the separation provisions for men and women would,
given the opportunity to work properly, result in equal average
tenure for both sexes." Post, at 517. This conclusion cannot, however, be reconciled with Congress' recognition that mandatory retirement provisions for women line officers "parallel present provisions
with respect to male officers except that the discharge of male officers
probably occurs about 2 years earlier" S. Rep. No. 676, supra, at
12; H. R. Rep. No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 17 (emphasis added).
Alternatively, the dissent seems to imply that the "anomalous" retention in 1967 of the 13-year tenure provision of § 6401 may have
resulted from congressional inadvertence. Post, at 514-515. But this

SCHLESINGER v. BALLARD
498

Opinion of the Court

The complete rationality of this legislative classification is underscored by the fact that in corps where male
and female lieutenants are similarly situated, Congress
has not differentiated between them with respect to tenure. Thus women staff officers not appointed under
§ 5590 are subject to the same mandatory attrition rule of
§ 6382 (a) as are male officers. These include officers in
the Medical, Dental, Judge Advocate General's, and Medical Service Corps. See 10 U. S. C. §§ 5574, 5578, 5578a,
5579. Conversely, active male lieutenants who are members of the Nurse Corps, like female lieutenants in that
Corps, are within the ambit of 10 U. S. C. § 6396 (c),
which contains a 13-year tenure provision like § 6401.
view cannot be squared with the legislative history either. A major
factor prompting the 1967 amendments was Congress' express con-

cern that unless restrictions on promotions of women naval officers
were lifted, the operation of § 6401 would cause excessive forced
retirement of women lieutenants. In discussing the problem, the
House Report explicitly described the 13-year provision:
"A particularly severe problem of promotion stagnation exists
among WAVE officers in the Navy. The present grade limitations
on promotion of WAVE officers to the grades of commanderlieutenant commander have so reduced the vacancies that the Navy
will be forced to discharge most regular WAVE lieutenants when
they reach their 13th year of service if relief is not provided.
"Present law (see. 6401, title 10, United States Code) provides
that women officers on the active list of the Navy in the grade of
lieutenant must be discharged on June 30 of the fiscal year in which
they complete 13 years of active commissioned service if not on a
promotion list that year. The Navy estimates that without legislative relief, the attrition among women line lieutenants will average
50 percent or more over the next 5 years. The Navy considers such
heavy attrition unacceptable." H. R. Rep. No. 216, supra, at 6.
It is thus clear that Congress in 1967 intentionally retained the
13-year tenure provision of § 6401, and did so with specific knowledge
that it gave women line officers a longer tenure than their male
counterparts.

OCTOBER TERM, 1974
Opinion of the Court

419 U. S.

In both Reed and Frontiero the reason asserted to

justify the challenged gender-based classifications was
administrative convenience, and that alone. Here, on
the contrary, the operation of the statutes in question
results in a flow of promotions commensurate with the
Navy's current needs and serves to motivate qualified
commissioned officers to so conduct themselves that they
may realistically look forward to higher levels of command. This Court has recognized that "it is the primary
business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to fight
wars should the occasion arise." Toth v. Quarles, 350
U. S. 11, 17.

See also Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S.

83, 94. The responsibility for determining how best our
Armed Forces shall attend to that business rests with
Congress, see U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cls. 12-14, and with
the President. See U. S. Const., Art. II, § 2, cl. 1. We
cannot say that, in exercising its broad constitutional
power here, Congress has violated the Due Process Clause
13
of the Fifth Amendment.
The judgment is reversed.
13 We observe that because of the restrictions that were removed
from women officers' participation in naval service in 1967, see Act
of Nov. 8, 1967, 81 Stat. 374; S. Rep. No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st
Sess., more opportunity has become available for women officers.
We are told by the Solicitor General that since 1967, the Secretary
of the Navy has implemented a program for acceleration of women
officers' promotion and that today women are being considered for
promotion within the same time periods as are men. Apparently believing that the need for a tenure differential has subsided, the Department of Defense has submitted a bill to Congress that would substitute
for § 6401 the same rule that governs male lieutenants. See §§ 2 (5)
and 4 (18) (L) of H. R. 12405 (93d Cong., 2d Sess.), which contains a new provision as a proposed replacement of both § 6382 and
§ 6401. These developments no more than reinforce the view that
it is for Congress, and not for the courts, to decide when the policy
goals sought to be served by § 6401 are no longer necessary to the
Navy's officer promotion and attrition programs.

MR. JUsTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JusTIcE DouGand MR. JUSTICE MARSH:ALL join, dissenting.
The Court concludes that the statutory scheme which
results in different periods of tenure for male and female
line lieutenants of the Navy does not contravene the Due
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because "Congress may... quite rationally have believed that women
line officers had less opportunity for promotion than did
their male counterparts, and that a longer period of
tenure for women officers would, therefore, be consistent
with the goal to provide women officers with 'fair and
equitable career advancement programs.'" Ante, at 508.
I believe, however, that a legislative classification that
is premised solely upon gender must be subjected to close
judicial scrutiny. Frontierov. Richardson,411 U. S. 677
(1973); Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) (BRENNAN,
J., dissenting). Such suspect classifications can be sustained only if the Government demonstrates that the classification serves compelling interests that cannot be otherwise achieved. Here, the Government as much as concedes
that the gender-based distinctions in separation provisions for Navy officers fulfill no compelling purpose.
Further, the Court goes far to conjure up a legislative
purpose which may have underlain the gender-based distinction here attacked. I find nothing in the statutory
scheme or the legislative history to support the supposition that Congress intended, by assuring women but not
men line lieutenants in the Navy a 13-year tenure, to
compensate women for other forms of disadvantage
visited upon them by the Navy.' Thus, the genderLAs

'Indeed, I find quite troublesome the notion that a genderbased difference in treatment can be justified by another, broader,
gender-based difference in treatment imposed directly and currently

based classification of which appellee complains is not
related, rationally or otherwise, to any legitimate legislative purpose fairly to be inferred from the statutory
scheme or its history, and cannot be sustained.

I
As the Court recounts, § 6401 was enacted as part of
the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, 62
Stat. 368. This Act, while providing for the first time
a permanent role for women in the military, severely
limited their career opportunities. Among other things,
it provided that women in the Navy could not be permanently promoted above the rank of commander, and it
set the number of women lieutenants, lieutenant commanders, and commanders at a small percentage of the
number of regular women officers on active duty. Perhaps because these limitations upon promotion opportunities made it impractical to guarantee women line
officers promotion at any uniform rate, the promotion
zone system provided for men by the Officer Personnel
Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 860, was not applied to them. And,
as explained by the Court, without a promotion zone system, the basis for determining involuntary separation
under § 6382 (a), whether an officer has twice "failed of
selection for promotion," has no meaning.2 Therefore,
chosen ground for decision, and the Court ought at least to consider
whether they may be valid before sustaining a provision it conceives
to be based upon them.
2 Also, even if it were possible to devise some alternative way of
deciding when a woman officer had "failed of selection for promotion," the limitation upon promotion opportunities for women meant
that retention until two failures of selection could have been indefinite retention. In 1967, in fact, the statutory grade limitations
upon promotions for women had produced such limited vacancies in
the upper ranks that, but for the fact that some of the limitations
were removed by the 1967 Act, promotions of lieutenants in the
WAVES would have had to be suspended altogether for four or five

the separation provisions for women line officers, given
the rest of the statutory provisions applicable to them,
had to be pegged to time served rather than to opportunities for promotion. The number of years selected for
women line lieutenants, 13, corresponded exactly to the
normal number of years Congress intended to precede
separation for a male officer not chosen for promotion.

See ante,at 504-505, n. 9.' Thus, Congress' original purpose in enacting slightly different separation provisions
for men and women is quite certain-to create the same
tenure in years for women lieutenants as for the average male lieutenant before involuntary separation was

permitted.
However, for reasons not entirely clear upon the record
in this case, the promotion zone system for men did not,
as administered by the Navy, result in the normal 13year tenure for men before involuntary separation contemplated by §§ 5764 and 5768.' Rather, in 1967 the
years. H. R. Rep. No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 6 (1967). See
Hearings on H. R. 5894 before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House
Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 384 (1967). If
involuntary separation had been keyed to failure of selection, no
WAVE line lieutenants could have been separated during those five
years.
3Section 5768 sets out the normal times of service for male officers
in the line of the Navy. Section 5764, the section establishing the
promotion zone system, specifies that the number of officers in the
promotion zone each year shall be chosen "in order to maintain a
flow of promotion consistent with the terms of service set out in
section 5768 .. .and in order best to assure to individuals in succeeding years equality of opportunity for promotion." Thus, the
"normal terms of service," § 5768, were to be achieved through the
administrative determination of promotion zones each year.
4The explanation seemingly lies in the provisions permitting suspension of these sections. Section 48 of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956,

provided that:
"(a) Except as they may apply to women officers of the Regular
Navy ...appointed under section 5590 of title 10, . . . the following

normal tenure for men seems to have been about 11
years, see H. R. Rep. No. 216, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.,
17; S. Rep. No. 676, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 12; and in
1972, when respondent was due for discharge, it was
eight or nine years. Brief for Appellants 16.
In 1967, Congress decided to eliminate many of the
provisions restricting career opportunities for women. In
doing so it wished, as the Court notes, to provide women
with "fair and equitable career advancement programs."
H. R. Rep. No. 216, supra, at 5. However, contrary to
the Court's assumption, Congress determined to achieve
this goal, not by providing special compensatory treatment for women, but by removing most of the restrictions upon them and then subjecting them to the same
provisions generally governing men. Id., at 3; S. Rep.
No. 676, supra, at 2.
First, the entire structure of the 1967 Act is directed
toward assimilating as much as possible the promotion
structure for women line officers to that of men. The Act,
for example, provided for a promotion zone system for
women line officers in the Navy, 10 U. S. C. § 5764 (d),
and applied the "failure of selection" designation to
sections of title 10 cease to operate whenever the number of male
officers serving on active duty in the grade of ensign or above in
the line of the Navy does not exceed the number of male officers
holding permanent appointments in the grade of ensign or above
on the active list in the line of the Regular Navy: Sections ...
5764-5770 ...." 70A Stat. 639.

Also, 10 U. S. C. § 5785 provides that:
"(b) During a war or national emergency, the President may
suspend any provision of the preceding sections of this chapter relating to officers of the Navy ...

, other than women officers appointed

under section 5590 of this title."
Because these sections do not apply to women covered by § 6401,
any suspensions could have the effect of shortening normal tenure
for men without affecting the tenure of women. See ante, at 505
n. 11.

women by amending 10 U. S. C. § 5776.' These additions
make the retention of 13-year tenure for women line
lieutenants somewhat anomalous, since the "failure of
selection" designation appears to have no function except as an aid to determining involuntary separation.
Thus, as the hesitant language the Court uses in describing Congress' possible compensatory purpose recognizes, it is impossible to divine from the structure of the
Act itself a. reason for retaining the 13-year tenure for
women but not for men.
Second, the legislative history of the 1967 Act makes
quite clear that Congress' purpose in retaining the 13year tenure for women line lieutenants was not to
take account of the limited opportunities available to
women in the Navy. Congress explicitly recognized that
Other examples of the degree to which women officers were subjected to the same promotion and retention system as men are:
(1) The amendment of 10 U. S. C. § 5771 so that women officers on
a promotion list, like men, can be promoted as soon as vacancies occur. This was done to prevent a delay of six to eight months in
promotion which caused "women officers to fall behind their male
contemporaries." H. R. Rep. No. 216, mpra, at 15; S. Rep. No. 676,
90th Cong., 1st Sess., 10.
(2) The amendment of 10 U. S. C. §§ 5704, 5711, and related sections so that all women line officers on active duty, including Reserve
officers, will, like all men line officers on active duty, be considered for
promotion by the same selection boards and in the same way.
Aside from § 6401, some distinctions between the promotion systems for male and female line officers did survive the 1967 Act. See,
e. g., 10 U. S. C. § 5707 (difference between men and women on standard for selection below lieutenant commander). It is significant,
however, that as a result of the 1967 amendments, the tenure in years
for unrestricted men and women line officers is the same for all grades
in which involuntary separation or retirement is linked for both to
years served. Compare 10 U. S. C. §§ 6376 and 6379 with § 6398;
§ 6380 with § 6400. However, in most instances men cannot be involuntarily retired until they have twice failed of selection and
reached the required tenure in years, while for women failure to be
promoted within the requisite number of years is sufficient.

To infer a determination purposely to perpetuate a
longer retention period for women line officers is, therefore, entirely to misconceive Congress' perception of the
problem and of the proper solution. While the reason
for the failure to revise §§ 6382 and 6401 is not clear, it is
certainly plausible to conclude that Congress continued to
believe, as it had in 1948, that the separation provisions
for men and women would, given the opportunity to work
properly, result in equal average tenure for both sexes.6
II

Given this analysis of the relationship between § 6382
and § 6401, the difference in tenure which resulted in fact
from the operation of these sections manifestly serves no
overriding or compelling governmental interest. Indeed,
appellants concede as much in discussing proposed
H. R. 12405 (93d Cong., 2d Sess.), §§ 2 (5) and 4 (18),
to which the Court refers, ante, at 510 n. 13: "The Department of Defense considers that the separate rule for
women, while serving a legitimate governmental purpose . ..is on balance no longer needed as a matter of

military personnel policy." Brief for Appellants 18.

Cong., 1st Sess., 46 (1967).
8 In addition, there are indications in the hearings on the bill that
the reason for not changing §§ 6382 and 6401 was that the promotional systems for all services were then under review, and that the
Armed Services therefore did not want to change in the interim provisions believed basically to apply equitably to both sexes. See Hearings on H. R. 5894 before Subcommittee No. 1 of the House Committee on Armed Services, 90th Cong., 1st Ses., 383 (1967) (remarks
of Assistant Secretary Morris); Hearings, Senate Committee on
Armed Services, supra, at 44 (remarks of General Berg).

the Navy can perceive no need for the gender-based classification under attack, the interest served by the classification, if any, can hardly be overriding or compelling.'
Further, while I believe that "providing special benefits for a needy segment of society long the victim of purposeful discrimination and neglect" can serve "the compelling ... interest of achieving equality for such groups,"
Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S., at 358-359 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), I could not sustain this statutory scheme even
if I accepted the Court's supposition that such a purpose
lay behind this classification. Contrary to the Court's
intimation, ante, at 508, women do not compete directly
with men for promotion in the Navy. Rather, selection
boards for women are separately convened, 10 U. S. C.
§ 5704, the number of women officers to be selected for
promotion is separately determined, 10 U. S. C. § 5760,
promotion zones for women are separately designated,
10 U. S. C. § 5764, and women's fitness for promotion is
judged as compared to other women, 10 U. S. C. § 5707.
In this situation, it is hard to see how women are disadvantaged in their opportunity for promotion by the fact
that their duties in the Navy are limited, or how increas9 The Court comments that the submission of H. R. 12405 "no more
than reinforce[s] the view that it is for Congress, and not for the
courts, to decide when the policy goals sought to be served by § 6401
are no longer necessary to the Navy's officer promotion and attrition
programs." Ante, at 510 n. 13. But the Court does not, and could
not, show that the gender-based classification underlying § 6401 was
ever necessary to the Navy's program; it only ventures that Congress
"may ... rationally," ante, at 508 (emphasis supplied), have believed
the policy to be wise or fair. Further, the close scrutiny which I believe gender-based classifications require necessitates that courts evaluate both the strength of the asserted interest and the need for the
means chosen toward that end. Implicit in this task is that the
courts do not necessarily accept the legislature's decisions about
the need for certain legislation when gender-based distinctions are
involved.

ing their tenure before separation for nonpromotion is
necessary to compensate for other disadvantages.
III
The Court suggests no purpose other than compensation for disadvantages of women which might justify this
gender-based classification. I agree that the "up or
out" philosophy "was developed to maintain effective
leadership by heightening competition for the higher
ranks while providing junior officers with incentive and
opportunity for promotion."

Ante, at 502-503.

But the

purpose behind the "up or out" philosophy applies as
well to women as to men. The issue here is not whether
the treatment accorded either women or men under the

statutory scheme would, if applied evenhandedly to both
sexes, forward a legitimate or compelling state interest,

but whether the differences in the provisions applicable to
men and women can be justified by a governmental
purpose."0
For this same reason, the invocation of the deference

due Congress in determining how best to assure the readilO In neither Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), nor Frontiero v.
Richardson, 411 U. S.677 (1973), was it doubted that the statutes in
question forwarded legitimate governmental goals, absent the classifications by sex. In Reed, the Court expressly noted that "the objective of reducing the workload on probate courts by eliminating one
class of contests is not without some legitimacy," 404 U. S., at 76,
and it noted that the statutory scheme set up non-sex-based classifications toward the same end, which it seemingly approved. Id., at
77. Similarly, in Frontiero, the inquiry focused upon the "difference
in treatment," 411 U. S., at 679, accorded women and men in determining eligibility for dependents' benefits, not upon the strength of
the Government's interest in according dependents' benefits to members of the Armed Services. Thus, I fail to see how the strength of
the governmental interest in the "up or out" system can distinguish
Reed or Frontiero. See also James v. Strange, 407 U. S. 128, 141
(1972); Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164,
173 (1972).

ness of our Armed Forces for battle cannot settle the issue
before us. As Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677
(1973), illustrates, the fact that an equal protection claim
arises from statutes concerning military personnel policy
does not itself mandate deference to the congressional determination, at least if the sex-based classification is not
itself relevant to and justified by the military purposes.
Thus, the validity of the statutory scheme must stand
or fall upon the Court's asserted compensatory goal. Yet,
as the analysis in Part I, supra, demonstrates, this purpose was not in fact behind either the original enactment
of § 6401 or its retention in 1967. While we have in the
past exercised our imaginations to conceive of possible
rational justifications for statutory classifications, see
McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425-428 (1961),
we have recently declined to manufacture justifications in order to save an apparently invalid statutory
classification. Cf. James v. Strange, 407 U. S. 128
(1972); Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406
U. S. 164 (1972). Moreover, we have analyzed asserted
governmental interests to determine whether they were
in fact the legislative purpose of a statutory classification,
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 442-443 (1972), and
have limited our inquiry to the legislature's stated purposes when these purposes are clearly set out in the statute or its legislative history. Johnson v. Robison, 415
U. S. 361, 376 (1974). Never, to my knowledge, have we
endeavored to sustain a statute upon a supposition about
the legislature's purpose in enacting it when the asserted
justification can be shown conclusively not to have
underlain the classification in any way."
11 Indeed, to do so is to undermine the very premises of deference
to legislative determination. If a legislature, considering the competing factors, determines that it is wise policy to treat two groups of
people differently in pursuit of a certain goal, courts often defer to
that legislative determination. But when a legislature has decided
