LANGENKAMP, SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE OF THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATES OF REPUBLIC TRUST &
SAVINGS CO. ET AL. V. CULP ET AL.
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT
No. 90-93.

Decided November 13, 1990

Respondents held thrift and passbook savings certificates, which were issued by debtor financial institutions and represented debtors' promise to
repay moneys respondents had invested. Within the 90-day period before debtors filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions, respondents redeemed some of the certificates. They became debtors' creditors when
they filed proofs of claims against the bankruptcy estates. Subsequently, petitioner trustee instituted adversary proceedings to recover,
as avoidable preferences, the payments which respondents had received.
After a bench trial, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the payments were
avoidable preferences, and the District Court affirmed. The Court of
Appeals, relying on Granfinanciera,S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33,
and Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323, reversed, ruling that respondents
were entitled to a jury trial in the preference action.
Held: Respondents were not entitled to a jury trial. By filing claims
against the bankruptcy estate, respondents triggered the process of "allowance and disallowance of claims," thereby subjecting themselves to
the Bankruptcy Court's equitable power. Granfinanciera,492 U. S., at
58-59, and n. 14. Thus, the trustee's preference action became an integral part of the claims-allowance process, which is triable only in equity.
As such, there is no Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. In contrast, a party who does not submit a claim against the estate is entitled
to a jury trial as a preference defendant, since a trustee could recover
the transfers only by filing what amounts to a legal action. Ibid. Accordingly, "a creditor's right to a jury trial on a bankruptcy trustee's
preference claim depends upon whether the creditor has submitted a
claim against the estate," id., at 58, a distinction overlooked by the
Court of Appeals.
Certiorari granted; 897 F. 2d 1041, reversed and remanded.
PER CURIAM.

This case presents the question whether creditors who submit a claim against a bankruptcy estate and are then sued by

LANGENKAMP v. CULP
42

Per Curiam

the trustee in bankruptcy to recover allegedly preferential
monetary transfers are entitled to jury trial under the Seventh Amendment. This action was brought by petitioner
Langenkamp, successor trustee to Republic Trust & Savings
Company and Republic Financial Corporation (collectively
debtors). Debtors were uninsured, nonbank financial institutions doing business in Oklahoma. Debtors filed Chapter
11 bankruptcy petitions on September 24, 1984. At the time
of the bankruptcy filings, respondents held thrift and passbook savings certificates issued by debtors, which represented debtors' promise to repay moneys the respondents
had invested.
Within the 90-day period immediately preceding debtors'
Chapter 11 filing, respondents redeemed some, but not all, of
debtors' certificates which they held. Thus, upon the bankruptcy filing, respondents became creditors of the nowbankrupt corporations. Respondents timely filed proofs of
claim against the bankruptcy estates. Approximately one
year after the bankruptcy filing, the trustee instituted adversary proceedings under 11 U. S. C. ยง 547(b) to recover, as
avoidable preferences, the payments which respondents had
received immediately prior to the September 24 filing. A
bench trial was held, and the Bankruptcy Court found that
the money received by respondents did in fact constitute
avoidable preferences. In re Republic Trust & Savings Co.,
No. 84C-01461, Adversary No. 85-0337 (ND Okla., June 26,
1987), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-45; In re Republic Trust &
Savings Co., No. 84-01461, Adversary No. 85-0319 (ND
Okla., June 26, 1987), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-64. The
United States District Court for the Northern District of
Oklahoma affirmed. Republic Financial Corp. v. Langenkamp, Nos. 87-C-616-C, 87-C-618-C, 87-C-619-C (June
30, 1988), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-67. On appeal, the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld
the District Court's judgment on three grounds, but reversed
on the issue of the holders' entitlement to a jury trial on the

trustee's preference claims. In re Republic Trust & Savings
Co., 897 F. 2d 1041 (1990). Relying on our decisions in
Granfinanciera,S. A. v. Nordberg, 492 U. S. 33 (1989), and
Katchen v. Landy, 382 U. S. 323 (1966), the Tenth Circuit
correctly held that "those appellants that did not have or
file claims against the debtors' estates undoubtedly [were]
entitled to a jury trial on the issue whether the payments
they received from the debtors within ninety days of the
latter's bankruptcy constitute[d] avoidable preferences."
897 F. 2d, at 1046. The Court of Appeals went further,
however, concluding:
"Although some of the appellants did file claims against
the estates because they continued to have monies invested in the debtors at the time of bankruptcy, . . . we
believe they likewise are entitled to a jury trial under
the rationale of Granfinancieraand Katchen. Despite
these appellants' claims, the trustee's actions to avoid
the transfers, consolidated by the bankruptcy court,
were plenary rather than a part of the bankruptcy court's
summary proceedings involving the 'process of allowance
and disallowance of claims."' Id., at 1046-1047.
Petitioner contends that the Tenth Circuit erred in holding
that those creditors of the debtors who had filed claims
against the estate were entitled to a jury trial. We agree.
In Granfinanciera we recognized that by filing a claim
against a bankruptcy estate the creditor triggers the process of "allowance and disallowance of claims," thereby subjecting himself to the bankruptcy court's equitable power.
492 U. S., at 58-59, and n. 14 (citing Katchen, supra, at 336).
If the creditor is met, in turn, with a preference action from
the trustee, that action becomes part of the claims-allowance
process which is triable only in equity. Ibid. In other
words, the creditor's claim and the ensuing preference action
by the trustee become integral to the restructuring of the
debtor-creditor relationship through the bankruptcy court's
equity jurisdiction. Granfinanciera,supra, at 57-58. As

LANGENKAMP v. CULP
42

Per Curiam

such, there is no Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.
If a party does not submit a claim against the bankruptcy estate, however, the trustee can recover allegedly preferential
transfers only by filing what amounts to a legal action to recover a monetary transfer. In those circumstances the preference defendant is entitled to a jury trial. 492 U. S., at
58-59.
Accordingly, "a creditor's right to a jury trial on a bankruptcy trustee's preference claim depends upon whether the
creditor has submitted a claim against the estate." Id., at
58. Respondents filed claims against the bankruptcy estate,
thereby bringing themselves within the equitable jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court. Consequently, they were not entitled to a jury trial on the trustee's preference action. The
decision by the Court of Appeals overlooked the clear distinction which our cases have drawn and in so doing created a
conflict among the Circuits on this issue. For this reason we
grant the petition for certiorari, reverse the judgment of the
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or
decision of this case.
