OCTOBER TERM, 1990

SHELL v. MISSISSIPPI
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE
SUPREME COURT OF MISSISSIPPI
No. 89-7279.

Decided October 29, 1990

Certiorari granted; 554 So. 2d 887, reversed and remanded.

PER CURIAM.

The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed informa pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted. To
the extent that the Mississippi Supreme Court relied on the
"especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravating factor in
affirming petitioner's death sentence, its decision is reversed.
See Maynard v. Cartwright,486 U. S. 356 (1988). Although
the trial court in this case used a limiting instruction to define
the "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" factor, that instruction is not constitutionally sufficient. See Godfrey v.
Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980); Cartwright v. Maynard, 822
F. 2d 1477, 1489-1491 (CA10 1987) (en banc), aff'd, 486 U. S.
356 (1988). The case is remanded to the Mississippi Supreme
Court for further consideration in light of Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990).
It is so ordered.

JUSTICE MARSHALL,

498 U. S.

concurring.

I concur in the reversal of petitioner's death sentence.
For the benefit of lower courts confronted with the issue
raised in this case, I write separately to clarify what I understand the basis of this disposition to be.
Petitioner was convicted of murder and sentenced to
death. He appealed his sentence on the ground that the jury
had been improperly instructed to consider whether the
charged murder was "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel,"
an aggravating factor that we deemed unconstitutionally
vague in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356, 361-364
(1988). The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. It reasoned that Maynard was distinguishable because the trial
court in this case limited the "especially heinous, atrocious or
cruel" factor in its charge to the jury. The instruction in
question provided:
"[T]he word heinous means extremely wicked or shockingly evil; atrocious means outrageously wicked and vile;
and cruel means designed to inflict a high degree of pain
with indifference to, or even enjoyment of[,] the suffering of others." 554 So. 2d 887, 905-906 (Miss. 1989).
These definitions, the court held, cured any constitutional deficiency in the underlying "heinous, atrocious or cruel" instruction. Id., at 906.
This conclusion was in error. The trial court in Maynard
issued a supplemental instruction defining "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" in terms nearly identical to the "limiting" instruction given in this case:
"'[T]he term "heinous" means extremely wicked or
shockingly evil; "atrocious" means outrageously wicked
and vile; "cruel" means pitiless, or designed to inflict a
high degree of pain, utter indifference to, or enjoyment
of, the sufferings of others."' Cartwright v. Maynard,
822 F. 2d 1477, 1488 (CA10 1987) (en banc).

MARSHALL,

J., concurring

The Tenth Circuit sitting en banc held that this instruction
did not cure the constitutional defect in the underlying "heinous, atrocious or cruel" instruction, see id., at 1489-1491,
and, in affirming that judgment, this Court implicitly agreed.
The basis for this conclusion is not difficult to discern. Obviously, a limiting instruction can be used to give content to a
statutory factor that "is itself too vague to provide any guidance to the sentencer" only if the limiting instruction's own
"definitions are constitutionally sufficient," that is, only if the
limiting instruction itself "provide[s] some guidance to the
sentencer." Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 654 (1990).
The trial court's definitions of "heinous" and "atrocious" in
this case (and in Maynard) clearly fail this test; like "heinous"
and "atrocious" themselves, the phrases "extremely wicked
or shockingly evil" and "outrageously wicked and vile" could
be used by "'[a] person of ordinary sensibility [to] fairly characterize almost every murder."' Maynard v. Cartwright,
supra, at 363 (quoting Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420,
428-429 (1980) (plurality opinion)) (emphasis added). Indeed, there is no meaningful distinction between these latter
formulations and the "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible
and inhuman" instruction expressly invalidated in Godfrey v.
Georgia, supra.
Nor is it of any consequence that the trial court defined
''cruel" in an arguably more concrete fashion than "heinous"
or "atrocious." Cf. Walton v. Arizona, supra, at 655 (approving instruction equating "cruel" with infliction of "mental
anguish or physical abuse"). "It has long been settled that
when a case is submitted to the jury on alternative theories
the unconstitutionality of any of the theories requires that
the conviction [or verdict] be set aside." Leary v. United
States, 395 U. S. 6, 31-32 (1969); see also Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 379-380 (1990) (acknowledging principle
in capital sentencing context). Even assuming that the trial
court permissibly defined "cruel," the instruction in this case
left the jury with two constitutionally infirm, alternative

bases on which to find that petitioner committed the charged
murder in an "especially heinous, atrocious or cruel" fashion.
See Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U. S. 564, 569-571 (1970)
(condemning post hoc speculation as to which alternative
ground informed jury verdict).
There is no legally tenable distinction, in sum, between
this case and Maynard v. Cartwright.
