McCARTHY v. PHILADELPHIA CIVIL SERVICE
COMMISSION
ON APPEAL TO THE COMMONWEALTH

COURT OF PENNSYL-

VANIA, EASTERN DISTRICT

No. 75-783.

Decided March 22, 1976

Philadelphia municipal regulation requiring city employees to be
residents of the city held to be constitutional as a bona fide
continuing residence requirement and not to violate the right of
interstate travel of appellant, whose employment as a city fireman was terminated under the regulation because he moved his
residence from Philadelphia to New Jersey.
19 Pa. Commw. 383, 339 A. 2d 634, affirmed.
PER CURIAM.

After 16 years of service, appellant's employment in
the Philadelphia Fire Department was terminated because he moved his permanent residence from Philadelphia to New Jersey in contravention of a municipal regulation requiring employees of the city of Philadelphia
to be residents of the city. He challenges the constitutionality of the regulation and the authorizing ordinances I as violative of his federally protected right of
interstate travel. The regulation was sustained by the
Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania' and review was
denied by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.? His timely
appeal is here pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).
The Michigan Supreme Court held that Detroit's sim§ 7-401 (u) of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter of 1951;
§ 20-101 of the Philadelphia Code (as amended); and § 30.01 of the
Philadelphia Civil Service Regulations.
2 19 Pa. Commw. 383, 339 A. 2d 634 (1975).
3 In an unreported order entered on September 2, 1975, that
court denied a petition for review.

OCTOBER TERM, 1975
Per Curiam

424 U. S.

ilar requirement for police officers was not irrational and
did not violate the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.4 We dismissed the appeal from that judgment because no substantial federal question was presented. Detroit Police
Officers Assn. v. City of Detroit, 405 U. S. 950 (1972).
We have therefore held that this kind of ordinance is not
irrational. Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U. S. 332, 343-345
(1975); see Wardwell v. Board of Education of Cincinnati, 529 F. 2d 625, 628 (CA6 1976).
We have not, however, specifically addressed the contention made by appellant in this case that his constitutionally recognized right to travel interstate as defined
in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969); Dunn v.
Blumstein, 405 U. S. 330 (1972); and Memorial Hospital
v. Maricopa County, 415 U. S. 250 (1974), is impaired.
Each of those cases involved a statutory requirement of
residence in the State for at least one year before becoming eligible either to vote, as in Dunn, or to receive welfare benefits, as in Shapiro and Memorial Hospital.'
Neither in those cases, nor in any others, have we questioned the validity of a condition placed upon municipal
employment that a person be a resident at the time of his
application.6 In this case appellant claims a constitutional right to be employed by the city of Philadelphia
4 Detroit Police Officers Assn. v. City of Detroit, 385 Mich. 519,
190 N. W. 2d 97 (1971).
5 Although there is a durational residence requirement in the
Philadelphia ordinances, appellant does not have standing to challenge that requirement.
6 Nor did any of those cases involve a public agency's relationship
with its own employees which, of course, may justify greater control
than that over the citizenry at large. Cf. Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968); CSC v. Letter Carriers,413 U. S.
548 (1973); Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601 (1973).

while he is living elsewhere.7 There is no support in our
cases for such a claim.
We have previously differentiated between a requirement of continuing residency and a requirement of prior
residency of a given duration. Thus in Shapiro, supra,
at 636, we stated: "The residence requirement and the
one-year waiting-period requirement are distinct and inAnd in Memorial Hospital,
dependent prerequisites."
supra, at 255, quoting Dunn, supra, at 342 n. 13, the
Court explained that Shapiro and Dunn did not question "'the validity of appropriately defined and uniformly applied bona fide residence requirements.'"
This case involves that kind of bona fide continuingresidence requirement. The judgment of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania is therefore affirmed.
and MR.
JUSTICE BLACKMUN would note probable jurisdiction and
set the case for argument.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE,

7 Appellant

MR.

JUSTICE BRENNAN,

seeks review of other alleged errors as if presented
in a petition for a writ of certiorari. We decline to review those
issues.
