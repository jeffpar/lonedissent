WARREN.

Syllabus.

a defence which he did not present, because ignorant of it,
but which, the court can see, he could have known if he had
used reasonable diligence to ascertain it. It is impossible to
suppose that Avery, on his return to Memphis after the war,
was not informed of the state of things concerning the occupation of his house during his absence, and yet he institutes
no inquiry on the subject, and when subsequently sued by
the United States for a large demand, allows it to pass into
a judgment without the assertion of any claim for the use
of his property. Under these circumstances he cannot be
permitted to do, two years after the rendition of the judgment, what he should have done on the trial of the cause.
It follows, as the result of these views, that the Circuit
Court did not err in overruling the motion to recall the execution and satisfy the judgment.
Nor did it err in refusing the writ of audild quereld, because this writ does not lie, where the party complaining has
had a legal opportunity of defence and has neglected it.*
Besides auditd quereld is a regular suit in which the parties may plead and take issue on the merits,t and cannot,
therefore, be sued against the United States, as in England
it could not against the Crown.

tended to prove these facts and some to prove a different state of facts.
The-court submitted it to the jury whether there had been any acceptance of the lease by B. Held that this was equivalent to submitting to
them whether the instrument had been delivered at all as the deed of
B., and that this was a proper submission; and that it was not equivalent
(as contended by the plaintiff in error) to submitting whether the deed
had been, delivered and accepted by B. on condition that he should be
released afterwards; a submission which it was admitted by the court
would not stand on the same footing.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Northern District of Illinois.
The action in the court below was in covenant and brought
by Wadsworth, who resided in New York but owned property at Chicago, against J. B. Warren and W. Fleming,
to recover rent upon a written lease of the same, alleged to
have been executed by the said Warren and Fleming.
Fleming being a bankrupt, Warren alone defended. He
appended to his plea denying that he owed the money demanded, a notice that he would give in evidence on the trial
that he and one Osgood agreed, with John De Koven, the
agent of the plaintiff, to rent the property mentioned, and
that he signed the lease with the express understanding that
Osgood should also sign it; that after he, Warren, signed
the lease De Koven sent it to Wadsworth, the plaintiff, in
New York, where it was executed by the plaintiff and returned to De Koven to be executed by Osgood, but that Osgood refused to execute it; that afterwards Fleming agreed
with De Koven, as agent of the plaintiff, to take the premises for the same time and upon the same terms that the
defendant and Osgood had agreed to take them; that when
the lease was signed by Fleming the defendant objected to
having his name on the lease with Fleming; that De Koyen said it would make no difference, that he would release the defendant on the back of the lease; that he wanted
to use the lease signed by the plaintiff and Warren, as it
would obviate the necessity of sending to New York to get
the plaintiff to sign a new lease; that De Koven delivered
the lease to Fleming alone; that the defendant never took
possession of the property demised, and never paid or was

WADSWORTH V.

WARREN.

Statement of the ease.

Palled upon for rent until after the bankruptcy of Fleming;
that the defendant never consented to be jointly bound with
Fleming, or to be bound at all by the covenants in the lease,
and that it was expressly understood between the defendant
and De Koven that "he would, as agent of plaintiff, release
defendant on the back of the lease before he delivered the
same to Fleming."
The lease showed the signatures and seals of Warren (the
defendant), Fleming (the bankrupt), and Wadsworth (the
landlord and plaintiff), and their names were also inserted
without erasures or interlineations in the body f it. It was
dated the 20th of April, 1867.
The defendant Warren did not set vp that any portion of
the rent had been paid, but sought to establish as a defence
the facts set forth in the notice above referred to. He testified that Osgood and himself agreed to take the premises for
five years, at $4800 a year, and that Osgood then went to
Michigan, where he resided; that shortly after Osgood went,
a Mr. Jenning came to the witness with a lease which he
believed was in blank, and requested him to sign it, saying
that he got up all the plaintiff's leases in this way and sent
them to New York for his signature; that shortly after this
he received a letter from Osgood informing him that he had
sickness in his family, and requesting the witness to dispose
of the lease; that he then' went to De Koven and told him
the facts as they were, not wanting, himself, to back out
after he had signed anything. He further testified:
"I told him I had found Mr. Fleming willing to take the
property, and willing to give good reference. Mr. Fleming and
I went down to see Mr. De Koven. Mr. Dc Koven said he
would see about it. When Mr. Osgood came, we went over to
see Air. De Koven together. While we were talking about the
lease, Mr. De Koven made the remark to Mr. Osgood, ' It won't
make any difference to you; you haven't signed the lease.' I
told him: 'Then,' says I, 'I won't accept the lease.' Mr. De
Koven then said, 'Now, Mr. Warren, I will tell you what I will
do; I will accept Mr. Fleming in here; put Fleming's name in
the lease instead of Osgood's, and I will indorse a release of you

on the back of the lease.' I told him that was all right. Mr.
Fleming signed his name while I was there, and returned it to
Mr. Do Koven, and left it there. I haven't seen the lease since.
I never had anything to do with the document. I told Do Koyen, as Osgood would not sign the lease I would not accept.
De Koven said he would put in Fleming's name instead of Osgood's, as Osgood hadn't signed it, and he would indorse to me
a release on the back of the lease, giving as a reason for doing
so, that it would save the time of sending the lease to New
York."
This testimony was supported by that of Osgood and
Fleming.
On a duplicate of the lease, signed and sealed, like the
other by Wadsworth (the landlord and plaintiff), and by
Warren and Fleming, the following indorsement, executed
by Fleming, appeared:
11ASSIGNMENT.
"State of Illinois, Cook County, ss.

"In consideration of one dollar, to me in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I have sold, assigned,
and set over to the said William Fleming, all my right, title,
and interest to the within lease; said Fleming assuming all liabilities under said lease, and releasing me, the undersigned,
from any and all liabilities whatever under the same.
" Given under my hand and seal, at Chicago, April 27th, A.D.
1867.
"J. B. WARREN. [L. S.]"
On the other hand, De Koven, the plaintiff's agent, testified that Warren and Osgood, in the first instance, agreed
to take the property upon the terms mentioned in the lease,
that he had leases signed in blank by Wadsworth, that a
lease was made out and that Warren signed it; that after
the season for renting was over, Warren requested witness
to release him and allow Fleming to take the lease; that
the witness declined to do this, as Warren was the only person he looked to for payment of the rent, but consented tc
take Fleming in the place of Osgood; that the leases were

Statement of the case.

then filled out in duplicate, and Warren and Fleming signed
them; that he gave one to Fleming and Warren and retained the other, and that the assignment from Warren to
Fleming was not on the duplicate at that time; and the
witness testified distinctly that he did not agree to release
Warren.
The plaintiff requested the court to instruct the jury:
"First. The jury will disregard all evidence given in behalf
of the defendant tending to show any verbal agreement or understanding between De Koven and the defendant Warren, to
the effect that De Koven would release Warren from the covenant in the lease, or that Warren should not be bound by the
lease.
"Second. The jury, upon the evidence given, should find the
issue for the plaintiff."
But the court refused to give either of these instructions,
and charged substantially as follows:
"The lease as produced here presents a legal claim, prima
facie, and the defendant is bound by it; and if there was nothing more presented, Warren would be bound, because he, having
signed the lease, would be considered in law to be the party to
it, and primdfacie to have accepted it. If not accepted by Warren, he would not be bound to pay. If a lease was signed by
Warren on condition that Osgood was to be a party to it, and
if Osgood refused to sign it, with the knowledge of Wadsworth
or his agent, De Koven, then Warren would not be bound to accept that lease. [If Warren refused to accept the lease with
Fleming, and the agent of Wadsworth agreed that to save
trouble of sending another lease to Wadsworth fbr his signature, if Warren would put his name to the lease he should not
be bound, and that Warren did not accept the lease with Fleming, then Warren would not be bound on the last lease.]
"Then come the witnesses on the part of the plaintiff. And
then if all the matter is laid aside that was presented by the
defendants' witnesses, and you take up the case upon the plaintiff's testimony, then, if the evidence as to the acceptance of
the lease by Warren does not satisfy the jury that it was not
accepted by Warren in the way I mention-then comes the alleged
promise of De Koven, the agent of Wadsworth, that he would release

WADSWORTH

V. WARREN.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the plaintiff in error.

Warren from the lease-that is, a verbal promise, not executed to
this day; and if such was the agreement, then Warren would have
to look to De Koven for a breach of that agreement, and would have
no defence here.
[" As to that assignment on the lease, if this was all the understanding between these parties, that Mr. Warren was not to
be liable, there was his name, and it would show; and if Fleming wanted to dispose of it or do anything with it, he could not
do it legally without Warren's consent. That assignment was
proper to vest the whole interest on paper in the lease in Fleming, which probably was the object of it, the consideration being
nominal]
"You will have to apply the testimony. The best way I can
instruct you is to take up that given on the part of the defendant, which we admit so as to satisfy the jury on the subject of
acceptance; and then, if they are not satisfied with that, the mere
verbal promise of De Koven to release Mr. Warren would not be good
defence here, I think, but would leave Warren to turn over on -De
Koven for a breach of his promise; and that is the way, I suppose,
the thing might turn possibly on your verdict for the plaintiff;
but we leave the matter with you to make the best you can of
the case."
To the parts of the charge within brackets the plaintiff
excepted.
Mr. J. Van Arman, for the plaintiff in error:
The case, in its best view for the defendant below, shows
that all parties intended that the lease should take effect as
a legal instrument, and operate, in form, at least, as a demise to Warren and Fleming, and that Warren should be
subsequently released from his covenants in the lease. The
very term "release" implies that the party who is to have
the. benefit of it has, at the time of receiving such benefit,
already assumed an obligation from which he is thereby discharged; and the assignment of all his interest in the lease
made by Warren to Fleming, seven days after the lease was
made, shows that they both then understood that they were
jointly vested with the title to the demised term. The qnestion then is, whether a verbal agreement, at the time of the

Opinion of the court.

execution of a deed, that one of the parties to it shall be
released from the covenants contained in the deed, or that
he shall not be bound by these covenants, can be given in
evidence to defeat an action brought for an alleged breach
of them. It is settled by authorities both ancient and modern
that it cannot be.*
The lease, after it was signed and sealed by Warren and
Fleming, was delivered by Fleming in Warren's presence to
De Koven, the plaintiff's agent. When a deed is delivered
to the grantee or obligee, and retained by him, he setting
up that the delivery was absolute, parol proof that the delivery was conditioned or otherwise than absolute, is incompetent in a contest between such obligee and the obligor.t
The release was never executed, nor was De Koven ever
called upon to execute or procure the execution of it. To
be effectual it must have been evidenced by a sealed instrument executed by the plaintiff himself, or by his duly authorized agent. It will not of course be contended that a
mere verbal agreement to release a party from his covenants
can bar a suit for the non-performance of them.
Messrs. . Anthony and C. F. Peck, contra, submitted that
there was no error in the charge, and that the verdict was
warranted, and is supported by the testimony.
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
Were this case before us on a motion for a new trial we
might feel constrained to send it back to another jury. But
it has been brought here by a writ of error, and we can,
therefore, reverse the judgment only for errors of law apparent in the record.
The testimony respecting the circumstances attending the
transaction in question is contradictory. On the part of the

-WADSWORTH V. "WARREN.

[Slip. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

defendant it is that he refused to accept the lease without
having Osgood bound with him; that the plaintiff's agent
agreed to take Fleming in his and Osgood's place, and agreed
that when Fleminig signed the contract he would indorse on
it a release of Warren, saying it would avoid the necessity
of sending a new lease to -Wadsworth, the plaintiff; for his
signature. On the other hand the plaintiff's agent denies
that he promised to release Warren, and states that he told
him he was the only man be looked to for the rent. lIe states
further that the defendant brought Fleming to him, that
both signed the lease and a duplicate thereof, and that the
duplicate was delivered to Fleming and the defendant. The
lease is dated April 20th, 1867, and on the duplicate retained
by the plaintiff's agent there appears an assignment of all
his interest in the lease by the defendant to Fleming. This
assignment is dated April 27th, 1867, but it was evidently
made on the day on which Fleming's signature to the lease
was made, for there is no evidence that the duplicate retained
by the plaintiff's agent was ever seen by the defendant after
Fleming signed it. Coupling this with the evidence that
De Koven, the plaintiff's agent, had agreed to take Fleming
in the place of Osgood and Warren, and had said that signing the instrument in the manner in which it was signed,
would avoid the necessity of sending a new lease to Wadsworth, the lessor, for his signature; coupling it also with
the other evidence, given by the defendant himself, that he
did not accept the lease, or deliver the deed, we think it was
a question to be submitted to the jury whether the contract
had ever been consummated, or, in other words, whether it
had been delivered and accepted as the contract of the defendant. It was not, therefore, erroneous to refuse the instruction prayed for, namely, "that the jury, upon the evidence given, should find the issue for the plaintiff"
The other prayer of the plaintiff for instruction was substantially granted. The court, when speaking of the alleged
promise of De Koven to release Warren from the lease, said
it was a verbal promise not executed, and, "if such was the
agreement, Warren would have to look to De Koven for a

Statement of the case.

breach of it, and would have no defence here." And again
the court said: "The mere verbal promise of De Koven to
release Mr. Warren would not be a good defence here, I
think, but would leave Warren to turn over on De Koven for
a breach of promise."
The remaining exceptions taken to the charge cannot be
sustained. It may be admitted, as contended for, by the
plaintiffin error, that when a deed has been delivered, and
the delivery has been accepted, a verbal agreement between
the parties, made at the time of the delivery, or previous
thereto, that one of them should be released from the covenants contained in the deed, cannot defeat an action at law
brought for an alleged breach of those covenants; but the
charge of the court was in harmony with this doctrine. It
may also be conceded that there can be no conditional delivery of a deed to the grantee, or covenantee, therein named;
but nothing in the charge intimated that there could be.
The question submitted to the jury was, whether there had
been any acceptance of the lease by the defendant. This
was equivalent to submitting the inquiry, not whether the
deed had been delivered on condition that Warren should
be released afterward, but whether it had been delivered at
all as the deed of the defendant. That such a submission
was proper, in view of the evidence, we have already said.
