RICHARD- C. L. MoNCuRE, AND WALTER P. CONWAY, EXECUTORS
OF MARY JAMES, PLAINTIFFS 11; ERROR, VS. ANN
DEFENDANT IN ERROR.

R.

DERMOTT,

An action of covenant was instituted by the executors of M. J. upon an obligation executed

by A. R. D., under seal, to M. J., by which she agreed to pay. a certain note or bond,
loaned by M. J to A. R. D., which bad been sold by A. R. D. at a usurious discount
and on a usurious contract. The bond or note of M. J. had been given to enable A. R,
D. to raise money to pay a debt due by her, and for which the note of M. J. had been
previously loaned to her. It was denied by the executors of M. J. that she had any
knowledge of the usurious dealing in which the boi.l or note of M. J. was sold. The
executors of M. J. were obliged to pay a large portion of the note or bond, and the action
was instituted to~recover so much as they had paid. A. R. D. set up the usury between
her and the person to whom she had sold the note or boid, as a defence to the suit of the
executors of M. J. It was held that the action on the covenant of A. R. D. could be
maintained: and that the usurious dealing between A. R. Dh and the purchaser of the note
or bond of M. J., did not render the covenant of A. R. D,, to pay the bond or note, invalil
The Court said the contract between the defendant and the purchaser of the bond, if embracing no other person than themselves, could affect no contract between other parties,
previously made; and whether that contract was usurious depended on the intention of
the parties to it. If it was made, bona fide, for the sale and purchase of the bond, although
at a discount which would insure to the purchaser twelve per cent. a year for the money
advanced, it would. not be usurious. If, on the other hand, the'sale of the bond was a
mere cover for avoiding the statutes against usury, and the real intention of the parties was
to make a contract for the loan of money, at a higher rate than the legal interest, then
the contract was usurious. But to involve M. J. in the usury, and to extend its taint to
the covenant of A. R. D., it must be shown by proof, that M. J. executed the bond or note
sold, for the purpose"of aiding A. R. D. to borrow money at usurious interest, and not to
enable A. R. D. to raise money by selling it in the market. When the holder ofM. J's.
note threatened proceedings on it, it was not necessary that the executors of M. J. should
give notice thereof.
No subsequent confirmation of a usunous contract, nor ay new contract stipulating to pay
the debt, with the usurious interest, will make it valid.
It is the settled law of Virginia that the bona fide purchaser of a bond or note, may take it,
at any rate or discount, however great, without violating the statute.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for.the county
of Washington, in the District of Columbia.
The plaintiffs in error, executcrs of Mary James, instituted an
action of covenant against the defendant, on the folkwing instrument
of writing:
Whereas, Mary James has executed her bond or note, dated the
28th day of November, 1828, payable to me on demand, for the sum
of twenty-six hundred and twenty dollars, which said bond or note
was merely loahed to me for the purpose of raising money upon,
and whereas, I'have, since the execution of the said bond or note as
aforesaid, assigned it to Philip Alexander, of 'Fredericksburg, for
value received of him, I do therefore, hereby bind myself, my heirs,
executors, and administrators, to pay and discharge the said bond
or note, with all interest that may accrue thereon, when the same
shall become due and payable.
Given under my hand and seal, this 12th day of August, 1829.

SUPREME COURT.
[Moncure et al. tw. Dermott.]

The evidence showed that the note of Mary James, which had
been, assigned to Philip Alexander, was not fully paid by Ann R.
Dermott, and that a large portion ot the same remained unpaid at
the death of Mary James, who had executed a -deed of trust to
secure the payment of it; and that her executors, Philip Alexander
having ordered the deed of trust to be enforced by the sale of the
land and negroes conveyed by the deed, naid the same out of the
funds of the estate in their hands.
The defendant alleged usury in the transaction for the loan of the
money; and by-an agreement between the counsel for the plaintiff
and the defendant, usury was allowed to be given in evidence as if
specially pleaded.
On the trial of the cause, certain billj of exceptions to the ruling
6f the Court were filed by the counsel for the plaintiff, and the jury.
under the charge of the Court, gave a verdict for the defendant;
upon which the Circuit Court gave judgment. The plaintiffs prosecuted this Writ of error.
The case, and the whole of the plaintiffs' bills of exceptions, are
fully stated in the opinion of the C6urt.
The case was argued by Mr. Moncure and Mr. Key for the plaintiffs in error: and by Mr. Hoban and Mr. Jones for the defendant.
Mr. Key, for the plaintiffs, contended that admitting usury to have
taken place between Ann R. Dermott ;nd Philip Alexander, in the
original loan of the money, this could not affect the transaction between Ann R. Dermott and Mary James, the testatrix of the plaintiffs
in error. This usury was unknown to Mary James, and the executors
have been obliged to pay to Philip Alexander the balance of the debt.
To affect the covenant on which suit is brought, it must be shown
to have been a contract for a usurious loan of money, or a security
for such a loan. Laws of Virginia, statutes of 12 Charles 2,. ch.
13. 12 Anne, ch. 1'6. 13 Eliz. The suit is brought on a contract
between Ann R.-Dermott and Mary James. Itis not a suit to recover money loaned, nor is the-obligation given as a security for a
loan.
Mary James had loaned her note to the defendant, to
enable her
to raise money on it, by selling it for her own use. This -had been
done long before the execution of the obligation on which this suit is
brought. The instrument is manifestly a covenant to secure Mary
James from liability for the loaned note. The covenant is to discharge the note when due, and she is to be secured from the payment
of the note.. 14 Johns. Rep. 177. Offley vs. Ward, 1 Lev. 235.
The covenant is not to Alexander, nor is it given to pay usurious
interest. Alexander is not a party to it; and it was never delivered
to him, nor made for his benefit. 'Had it been made and delivered
to Alexander, it would have been nudum pactum. The defendant
was already fully liable to him on her assignment to him of the noteof Mary James, and there would therefore have been no eonsideration for it.

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

[Moncure et a. vs. DennotL]

What law avoids such an instrument? Suppose Mary James,
instead of lending her note to the defendant, had loaned the money
to pay the usurious debt, and had taken a note for its repayment; it
is settled that usury in the original loan would be no defence to such
a note: nor is it a defence in any case, where a subsequent contract
is made vWith a third party who is a stranger to the usury. 1 Mass.

It was said, in the Circuit Court, that the plaintiffs should have
given notice of, Alexander's claim upon Mary James's note, and
should have called on Ann R. Dermott to defend against the claim.
But the obligation is exactly otherwise. The defendant shouildhave
given the executors of Mary James notice not to pay the note, and
set up the usury. 8 Wendall, 458, 459. The plaintiffs were not
bound to make defence. They had no proof of usury. The defendant stood by and saw the executors pay the debt, and afterwards -set up the usury between herself and Alexander, against the
executors; who had paid her debt, ignorant of any defence that could
be made to the claim, of payment from the estate of Mary James.
Mr. Moncure, for the plaintiffs in error, said:
The three'instruetions praiyed for by the plaintiffs and refused by
the Court below, present for the decision of this Court the three fl16wing propositions.
1st. That a surety paying a usurious debt without being notified
by the principal of the existence of the usury, and instructed on
that ground to resist the payment, is entitled to recover from the
principal the money paid.
2d. That a surety paying a usurious debt without any knowledge
of the usury, or of any other objection to the validity of the debt,
and under the belief that the same is bona fide due, is entitled to
recover from the principal the money paid: and
3d. That the executors of a surety paying a usurious debt without any knowledge of the usury, and after the principal had waived
and alandoned all objection to the validity of the debt, and assented
that the same should be considered as valid and legal, are entitled
to recover from the principal, the money paid.
The affirmative of these three propositions is maintainer1 by the
counsel for the plaintiffs, on the following authorities. Ro'Anson vs,

[Moncure et A. a,. Dermott.]

Turner vs. Hume, 4 Esp. 11. ,Scott vs. Lewis, 2 Conn. Rep .132.
Green vs. Kemp, 13 Mass. 515.
The covenant upon which this suit was brought is in effect a covenant of indemnity.; and the plaintiffs having paid the supposed
usurious debt- without any knowledge or suspicion of the usury, are
entitled to recover on the covenant the money paid by them, though
they made the payment without suit, and without notice to the defendant. Such would be the case on general principles, but it is especially so here, where the principal had, removed from the state,
and where payment by the plaintiffs was necessary to have the property of their testatrix from sale under the deed of trust. Douglas§ vs. Clarke, 14 Johns. 177. Chase vs. Hinman, 8 Wend. 452.
Ken. vs. Mitchell, 2 Chit. 487.
The plaintiffs also contend that there is error in the judgment of
the Court below, in granting the instruction prayed for by the defendant.
1st. The hypothetical case stated in that instruction is not a case
of usury. Usury will not be presumed ; and if, upon ,any rational
hypothesis the transaction could have been, legal, it will not be presumed to have been usurious. The statute of usury is highly penal
in its character, and should not be applied without strong and clear
proof of the usury. Crenshaw's administrator vs. Clarke and
others, 5 Leigh, 65. Whitworth vs. Adams, 5 Rand. 404-425. The
contract in this case having been"made in Virginia, must be governed
by the law, and the decisions of that state. It has been there decided
that the bona fide purchase of a bond made for sale, at a greater discount than legal interest is not usurious. Hansborough vs. Baylor,
2 Mun. 36; also, Taylor vs. Bruce, Gil. 42. Whitworth vs. Adams, 5 Rand. 333. There is nothing in the facts stated in the defendant's instruction inconsistent with a bona fide purchase of the
bond from the defendant. The purchaser may well have supposed
that Mary Janmes was indebted to the defendant in a sum equal to, or
exceeding the amount of the bond; and that the defendant was willing
to sell so much of the debt as would raise the sum which she needed,
and no more. Or he may have well supposed, that Mary James, being a maiden aunt of the defendant, and warmly attached to her, had
given her the bond which was offered to him for sale. -In either
case the transaction would have been perfectly legal; and knowledge of it on the part of the purchaser would not have made the
purchase usurious.
2d. The Court in giving the instruction, weighed the evidence
and decided upon the facts which should have been left exclusively
to the jury. 5 Rand. 397, 407. 6 Leigh, 517. 4 Maul. and Selw.
192. 3 Corn. Law Rep. 97. 1b. 109. 5 Ib.417. Where the facts
found in a special verdict, or stated hypothetically in an instruction,
show a loan or forbearance of money at more than legal interest,
the corrupt agreement is an intendment of law, and need not be expressly found or stated; but where the transaction presents itself in

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

349

[Moncure et al. v8. Dermott.]

the form of a sale of a bond, or in any other form which may be
used as a shift or device to evade the statute, the corrupt intent to
evade the statute is a question of fact, which must be left to the
jury. The case of Roberts vs. Tremayne, Cro. Jac. 507, is ir accordance with this distinction.
Mr. Hoban and Mr. Jones, for the defendant, contended: that as
to so much of the plaintiffs' exceptions to the decision of the Circuit Court as goes to the refusal of the instructions to the jury,
moved on the part of the plaintiffs, all the said instructions were
properly- refused, as being erroneous in the general principles-of
law assumed in them; or, even if correct in their principles, yet
they were propounded with such qualifications and adjuncW, as
were wholly inadmissible, and vitiated the instructions throughout
their entire frame.
As to the instruction finally granted at the instance of the de.fendant, upon the hypothetical. state of facts therein set forth, it is
contended, that the facts assumed are fairly deduced from evidencenot only sufficiently pertinent to the conclusions of fact assumned,
but going to the clearest proof of those conclusions: that the Circuit
Court has, nevertheless, fairly left every fact, and every conclugion
of- fact, to the free and unbiassed judgmefit .of the jury: that such
facts, being found true, do amount, in every circumstance both of
act and intent, to technical usury, in both the forms stated by the
Court: and that the legal conclusion of usury would follow froni
such facts found in a special verdict: yet the Court has left all the
conclusions and presumptions of usury from the facts, equally as the
facts themselves, to the judgment'and discretion of the jury.
Mary James was acquainted with the whole transaction for procuring the money from Philip Alexander, and she cannot be. excluded from the influence of the law on, the subject of usury, by
coming forward as a suitor on the obligation of guaranty, given by
the defendant in error. The original note, for the payment of which
the money was procured fr6m Alexander, was the note of Mary
James. She was the debtor on that note, and originally liable for
its payment. IIt was to relieve her from this liability the money
was procured by the. usurious dealing between the lefendant, and
Alexander--of all the circumstances she was fully cognizant.
How is the law settled with regard, to -principal and surety,
when the surety is collaterally liable for a Usurious contract? It is
claimed that notice of the nature of the transaction is not necessary.
If the contract was originally usurious, the guarantee is void.
Comyn on Usury, 133.
A new contract made by the parties, with a stranger ignorant of
the usury, is not affected by it, and is valid. But if the old contract
is continued, and is usurious, no recovery can be had. But on a
new contract it is different. Conyn on Usury, 196. 1 Mass. 137.

could have been enforced against her in a Court of Chancery, by

contract.
Mr. jluetice M'KIINLEY delivered the opinion of the Court:This cause is brought before this Court upon a writ of error, fo
the Circuit Court of Washington county, in the District of Columbia.
The plaintiffs brought siuit against the defendant, in the Court
below, upon a covenant executed by the defendant as follows:
"Whereas Mary James has executed her bond or note, dated the
28th day of November, 1828, payable to me on demand, for the
sum of twenty-six hundred and twenty dollars, which said bond or
note was merely loaned to me for the purpose of raising money
upon; and whereas I have since the execution of said bond or note
assigned it to Philip 'Alexander, of Fredericksburg, for value received of him; I do therefore hereby bind myself, my heirs, executors and administrators, to pay and discharge the said bond or note,
with all interest that may accrue-thereon, Whenthe same shall become due and payable. Given under my hanid and seal,. this 12th
day of August, 182-9.

ANN R. DERMOTT."

[SEAL.]

To this suit the defendant pleaded non assumpsit, with leave to give
usury in eviden ce.
At the trial it was proved that the testatrix became principal in a
bond to Thomas Poultney and Son, of Baltimore, bearing date the
31st day of March, 1826, for the sum of three thousand six hundred
and thirty-three dollars, it being for the payment of a debt due by the
defendant, who also signed th bond, payable on the 23d day of
November, 1828; and that the testatrix executed a deed'of trust
upon her land and negroes, to secure and save harmless William
C. Beale, John Moncure, and Thomas Ledden, who had become
sureties to said bond, at the request of the.testatrix: and that the
reason why she gave her own bond for the debt of the defendant
was, because the defendant could not give satisfactory security to
the sureties: that in the spring of the yehf 1828 the defendant
applied to John Moncure, to aid, her in borrowing money to pay off
the bond to Poultney and Son, who. informed her that he did not
believe that money could be, borrowed in Fredericksburg at legal
interest; and advised her to procure the -note of the testatrix, who
was her aunt, and sell it in the market., Several conversations took
place between that time and the next November, between Moncure,
acting as agent of the defendant, and Philip Alexander, of Freder-'
icksburg, in relation to the sale of a bond or note of the testatrix ;
when, finally, Alexander agreed that he Would buy the bond, provided he could make at the rate of twelve per centlm a year upon
his money, knd obtain security for its final payment by a deed of
trust upon the landpnd negroes of the testatrix. While these negotiations were pendiiig, the testatrix addressed a letter to Alexander,
dated the 25th of November, 1828, in which she stated that her

JANUARY TERM, 1839

[Moncure et-al. vs. Dermott.].

niece, the defendant, had informed her that she intended selling and
assigning to him the bond of the testatrix for $2880,'payable on,
demand, and proposing, if he would give her time for the payment
of the money, she would give a deed of trust upon her land andnegroes, to secure its payment. These negotiations were protracted
until the money to Poultney and Son was so nearly due that there
was not time sufficient to complete the' arrangements in relation to
the bond and security ; nd Alexander-agreed to advance the sum
required, $2340, upon an undertaking, on the part of Moncure and
Beale, that they would refund the money to him if the defendant
failed to assign the bond, and the testatrix to execute the deed. On
the 1st of December, 1828, the defendant assigned to Alexander the
bond of the testatrix for twenty-six hundred and twenty dollars;
and, on the 10th day of the same month, the testatrix executed the
deed of trust, in which it was stipulated that the bond was. to be
paid at the end of two years, with legal interest.
During all this time the.testatrix and the defendant lived.togetherin Virginia, some distance from Fredericksburg. The defendant
afterwar&s removed to Washington, where she resided when this
suit was commenced. From the month of April, 1831, to-the month
of May, 1832, she made several payments to Alexander on 'the
bond-; and, by letters to the testatrix, expressed her anxious desire
to pay -it off, that the testatrix and her property might be released
from further responsibility on her account. After the death of the
testatrix Alexander put the bond into the hands of the trustee, with
directions to sell the trust property, unless, within a reasonable time,
the plaintiffs paid the balance due.
The plaintiffs prayed the Court to instruct the jury, ,that it is not
competent for the defdndant in this action to deny by plea or otherwise, the validity of the note of 28th November, 1828, recited in
the covenant on which this suit is brought, and that she is estopped
from setting up in this action any alleged usury, as affecting the
validity of said note; that the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in
this action the sums which the jury are satisfied from the evidence
were paid by the plaintiffs to Philip Alexander, on the bond dated
28th November, 1828; unless the defendant proves to the jury, that
before such payments the plaintiffs were notified that the bond of
28th -November, 1828, was tainted with usury, and instructed to dispute the same; which the Court refused. And then further prayed the
Court to instruct the jury as follows: that if the jury should believe
from the evidence, that the note of Mary James to the defendant,
assigned by Alexander, dated 28th November, 1828, was made on
an usurious agreement entered into between said defendant and
said Alexander,but that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of such usury
at the time they were called upon to pay the balance due on the
note, nor at any time before, and paid the same under the belief that
the same was bona fide due, and without any knowledge that there
was any objection to the validity of said note; and without any
notification or communication from the defendant,-then the plaintiff
2o-2

SUPREME COURT.
[Moncure et al. v8. Dermott.]

are entitled to recover; unless the jury should be satisfied from the
evidence, that the said Mary James knew of the said usurious
agreement, under which the said note was given and assigned as
aforesaid : which the Court also refused. And further prayed the
Court as follows: that if the jury should believe from the evidence,
that the note of Mary James, the defendant, assigned Vy her to
Alexander, dated 28th November, 1828, was made on an usurious
agreement, entered into bbtween said defendhnt and-said Alexander,
but that- the plaintiffs had no knowledge of such usury, at the time
they were called upon to pay the balance due on the note, nor at
any time before, and paid the same under the belief that the same
was bona fide due, and without any knowledge that there was any
objection~to the validity of said note, and without any notification
or communication from the .defendant ; and if the jury believe from
the evidence, the defendant waived and abandoned all objection to
.the validity of said note, and assented that the same should be considered as a valid and legal obligation, then the plaintiffs are' entitled
to recover. And it is competent for the jury to infer such waiver
and assent, if they'shall believe from the evidence tht the defendant, after obtaining said money, made payments of interest, as the
same became due, and expressed her desire knd intenti6n to pay
the' aid note, and her anxiety to save her aunt's property from sale
tunder the said deed of trust; which the Court also refused. To all
which refusals by the Court to give the several instructions as
prayed; the plaintiffs except.
And -the plaintiff's counsel then further prayed the Court as follows; that if the jury believe from the evidence, that there was no
loan of money from Alexander to defendant secured by the bond
of the 28th November, 1828, but that the said bond was bona fide
purchased by said Alexander of defendant, at a discount exceeding
,the.legal rate of interest, the said Alexander not knowing when he
purchased said bond, that the same was loaned by Mary James to
the defend~nt solely to raise money on, the transaction is notusurious, and the plaintiffs, are entitled to recover in this action the
moneys paid by them to Alexander on said bond; and further, if
the jury should believe that Philip Alexander, when he paid the
money and took the note as aforesaid, intended to buy the said note
for the amount given on it, not knowing that the note was made by
Miss James to defendant, in order to raise money on it, and did not
mean, by disguising the advance under the form of a purchase, to
evade the statute of usury, then such purchase was lawful; which
prayers the Court gave as prayed, and to which the defendant
excepts.
And the defendant's counsel thereupon prayed the Court as follows: if the jury find and believe, from the evidence aforesaid, that
for several months before the execution and assignment of the bond
or note mentioned and described in the covenant on which the suit
is brought, there were such negotiations and propositions, pending
between said John Moncure, (acting in behalf of defendant,) and

JANUARY TERM, 1839.-

383

[Mo., e' . v9. Dermott.
said Philip Alexander, as are -mentioned and set forth in said
affidavits of Moncure -and Alexander, and in the papers and exhibits therein referred to, that the tfue and genuine nature and object
of such negotiations and propositions; and of the successive .arrangements and understandings re'sulting from them, as really-contemplated by both parties, were that said Alexander should make an
advance of money to defendant, upon a future bond or note of said
Mary James, payable to defendant, and by her to be assigned to
said Alexander, under the name and form of a sale of such bond or
note at a discount, above legal rate of interest; that such discount,
from the amount of such bond o- note should be so adjusted, as that
the difference between the full amount of the bond or note, and the
sum advanced on it, should be equivalent to an interest at the rate
of twelve per cent. per annum on the sum actually advanced for the
time of forbearance, to be given_ on such bond or note; that all .the
said preliminary negotiations, propositions, and arrangements, were,
just before the execution and assignment of the bond or note referred
to in the covenant set forth in the plaintiffs' declaration, (such bond or
note, being the same note -under seal, or bill obligatogy, above given
in evidence by plaintiffs, with the said covenant, and annexed to
the said original affidavit of said J. Moncure, as aforesaid,) terminated in. an arrangement so modifying 'the before pending, propositions and arrangements aforesaid, as that said Alexander should
immediately advance the defendant 2340 dollars, and that defendant
should assign to him a note or bond thereafter, to be drawn and
executed by said Mary James, for such amount as should make the
difference between the sum so advanced, and the sum to be ultimately received by him for the principal and interest of such bond
or note, equivalent'to an interest of twelve per cent. per annum on
-the sum so advanced, according to -the.principle on which said Alexander, -in his letter, a copy of whichis on the record, to said Moncure, insisted that the profits of the transaction should be calculated
and secured, and that the payment of such bond or note should be
collaterally secured by a deed in trust of the -land and slaves of said,
Mary James. That-the said Alexander, in pursuance and execution
of such arrangement and understanding, did advance tie said 21340
dollars to defendant, or for her use; that the said Mary James, in
the pursuance and execution of the same arrangement and understanding on her part, did afterwards, on the 28th.November, 1828,
execute and 'deliver -the said note under seal, or bill obligatory of
that date, and afterwards, on the loth December, 1828, duly execute
and delivtr to said J. Moncure, and P. Alexander, the said deed in
trust bearing that date, as above given in evidence by defendants,
and annexed to the said cross-examinagion of said Moncure, a copy
of which is on therecord, and that the defehdant, in the pursuance
and execution of the said arrangement and understanding, did assign
the said bill obligatory to said Alexander,.immediately on the execution ofthe same by said Mary James; that the amount of said
securities', and the time with which said Mary James was indulged
2

v8. Dennott.)
[Moncure et al.

by said deed, in trust for payment, were knowingly and designedly
calculated, and adjusted by and between said Alexander and said
Moncure, in behalf of defendant, so as to produce in the end a
yearly interest of twelve per cent. on the sum advanced during such
time of indulgence; and that the principal and interest secured by
the said instruments, were intended and designed by both parties to
amount, and did in fact amount, to greatly more than the sum so
advanced- with legal interest, for such time of indulgence as aforesaid; and did in fact substantially secure to said Alexander,- a
yearly interest of twelve per cent. on the sum so advanced by him.
Then the jury, if' they find such facts as aforesaid. satisfactorily
proved, and fairly deducible from the evidence aforesaid, may properly infer, fr6m such facts, and fairly; presume that the transaction
was substantially a loan within the meaning of the statute against
usury; notwithstanding it may appear to have been made in the
foi and name of a. sale of -the said Mary James's bond or note;
and then the jury -may, from the same facts and circumstances, if
proved and deduced as aforesaid, also properly infer' and well presume, that the sum of money deducted and retained by said Alexder, from the nominal amount of said bond or note, was substantially usurious interest under another name, for the forbearance. of
the money so lent or advanced;- which the Court gave as prayed, to
which the plaintiffs except ; and pray the Court to sign and seal this
bill of exceptions, as well as the granting of the said defendant's
prayer, as .to the refusal to grant the prayer aforesaid of said plaintiffs, which is accordingly done this 24th day of May,-1838. And
the said defendait, by her said,counsel, having excepted, as aforesaid, to the said instructions given by the Court at the request of the
plaintiff as aforesaid, also prays the Court to sign and seal this her
bill of exceptionp to the said instruction, so given at the request or
prayer
the plaintiff, which is also done this 24th May, 1838.
Uponofthe
judgment bf the.Circuit Court on the several
prayers
for instruction to the jury, by'the plaintiffs and the defendant, these
questions arise : 1. Does proof of usury, in the contract between
the defendant and Alexander, per se, make void the bond assigned
to Alexander, and the covenant, also, upon which the suit in the
Court below was founded.? 2. If the testatrix had no knowledge
of the.usurious agreement between the defendant and Alexander,
and the plaintiffs we'e also ignorant, and knew nothing of such usurious agreement, when they were called on to pay the balance du
on the bond, and they paid it under the belief that it was a bona fide
debt, and without any'notice to the contrary from the defendant,
were they entitled to recover in the Court below ?
The contract between the defendant and Alexander for the purchase of the bond, if embracing no other party than themselves,
could affect no contract between other parties previously" made; and
whether that contract was usurious depended on the intention of
the parties to it. If it was made bona fide, for the sale, and purchase
of the bond, although at a.discount which would insure to Alexan..

[Moticure et al. vs. Dermott.)

der twelve per cent. a year, for the money advanced, it would not
be usurious. If, on the other hand, the sale of the -bond was a
mere cover for the purpose of evading the statute against usury,
and the real intention of the parties was to make a contract for the
loan of money at a higher rate of interest than six per cent., then
the contract was usuriois. But to involve the testatrix in the usury,
and to extend its taint to the bond, as well- as to the assignment, it
must have been shown by proof that she executed the bond for the
purpose of aiding the defendant to borrow money at usurious interest, and not to enable her to raise money by selling it in -the
market.
,As the third prayer of the plaintiffs is materially different from
the first and second, we will examine it first. If the first member
of it had been presented alone. it would, in our opinion, have been
proper for the Court below to have granted it: but as it was inseparably connected with, the latter member, it presented a very different
question. The objectionable part is in these words: "And if the
jury believe, from the evidence, the defendant waived and abandoned all objection to the validity of said note; and assented that
the same should be considered as a valid and legal obligation, then
the plaintiffs are enititled to recover; and it is competent for the
jury to infer such waiver and assent, if they shall believe from the
evidence, that the defendant, after obtaining said mo', ey, made payments of interest, as the same became due, and expressed her desire
and intention to pay the said, note, and her anxiety to save her
aunt's property from sale under the said deed of trust."
This reasoning proceeds on the assumption that a bare promise to
pay an usurious debt, or a partial payment of It, would, take the
contract out of the statute against usury. No subsequenft confirmation, nor new contract stipulating to pay the debt, with the usurious
interest, will make it valid. Notwithstanding, therefore, the defendant may have declared her determination to pay the debt, and
lid actually pay a part of it, she had, nevertheless, a perfect right,
afterwards, to avail herself of the plea of usury; therefore, the
Court below did right in refusing the instruction.
.,The first and second instructions prayed for by the plaintiffs, and
that prayed for by the defendant, may well be considered together.
Jointly they embrace the whole case, and present the two questions
before stated. The facts stated in the prayer of the defendant, if
found by the jury, taken alone and unconnected with the facts stated in
the prayers of the plaintiffs, Would oppose no legal bar to the plaintiffs' action; unless, indeed, an usurious contract between the
defendant and Alexander, could impart its usurious taint to the bond
assigned, and the covenant *sued on., The Court below having
decided, by refusing :the prayers of the plaintiffs, that knowledge,
on the part of the testatrix, of the usurious contract, was not necessary to subject the two contracts between her and the defendant to
the taint of usury.
They, therefore, put the,case upon the dxpress ground, that proof

of usury in the contract between the defendant and Alexander, did,
per se, make void the bondassigned, and the covenant sued on. If
the testatrix had no knowledge of the existence of usury in the contract between the defendant and Alexander, the bond which she
gave to the defendant, although without valuable considration,
was not usurious. There must be a loan, and the taking of more
than legal interest, or the forbearance of payment of a pre-existing
debt, upon a contract for, illegal interest, to constitute usury. Barclay is.
Walmsley, 4 East, 57. The fact of knowledge) in the plaintiffs testatrix) is very material; first, to show whether the bond
which she executed to the defendant was usfirious; and, secondly,
to show whether thi-covtract between the defendant and Alexander
was usurious. If the bond was free from usury in its inception, no
subsequent transaction between other parties could invalidate it.
Nichols vs. Fearsoft and others, 7 Peters' Rep. 106. Although this
bond may have been executed without valuable consideration, in
the hands of a bona fide purchaser, without notice of that fact, it
would be good against the obligor. It is the settled law in Virginia, that the bona fide purchaser of a bond or note may take it at
any rate of discount, however great, without violating the statute
against usury. Hansborough vs. Baylor, 2 Mun. Rep. 36. 5 Rand.
33. If the testatri± was neither a party nor privy to thd contract,
between the defendant and Alexander, it was a very material fact
for the jury to consider when inquiring whether there was usury in
the agreeipent between the defendant and Alexander : because, if
the testatrix had no knowledge of the usurious contract between
them, it was impossible that she could have been party or privy
to it. Suppose the jury had, found, specially, that the testatrix
was neither party nor privy to the contract between the defendant
and Alexander, and that Alexander had no knowledge of the fact
that-the bond which he purchased from the defendant had been
,executed by the testatrix without valuable consideration; the contract of assignment would have been entirely free from usury, and
the testatrix liable upon the bond. But that liability has never been
questioned. Viewing the case in this aspect, the defendant would
have had no pretext for pleading usut.y against the plaintiffs in this
cause,

But upon what ground is it that usury is set up by the defendant
against her covenant of indemnity ? If that covenant had been given
to Alexander, and th6 first contract was usurious, he would have
been in no better condition; because the consideration being the
same, the taint of usury would have attached to it at once. But the
case is very different between the defendant and the testatrix. The
latter had lent her note to the defendant, and conveyed her land and
negroes to a tfustee to secure the payment of it. She was no party
to the usury; and she had given a full and valuable consideration to
the defendant for the covenant of indemnity. The Circuit Court, by
'refusing to permit the jury to inquire into the fact of knowledge on
the part of the testatrix, in relation to the usury, thereby admitted

JANUARY TERM, 1839.

357

[Moncure et al. v. Dermott]
her ignorance of that fact. Therefore, as between these parties, the
whole transactitn was legal, and the covenant free from all taint
of usury. Cuthbert and another vs. Haley, 8 Term Rep. 390.
Upon the second question it -will only be necessary to examine
the point, whether the defendant was bound to give notice to the
plaintiffs of her intention to plead the statute against usury in bar
of the debt due to Alexander; the other points having been fully
examined on the first question stated. It is obvious, from the evidence in the cause, that the defendant commenced, the negotiotion
with Alexander for the sale of the bond of the testatrix, andgonducted it to its final conclusion; and that she was bound to know
every fact and circumstance 'connected with, ti- whole case. In
Ford vs. Keith, 1 Mass. Rep. 138, the case vfas of a surety who had
paid the d~bt. lnowing at the time that it was founded on an usurious contract. He brought suit against the. principal to recover the
amount paid, to which he pleaded the usury between him and thb
payer of the note. Judge Strong, who d'elivdred the opinion of the
Court, said: "The defendant says, it is true the money was borrowed for me; I received it, and had the benefit of it; I requested
you to become my surety and sign the note, and you have paid the
contents; yet as I had a' legal right to avoid the note, you shall not
recover of me. Will the law permit the defendant to get rid of the
present action on such grounds? He presumed it would not. No
man is bound to take advantage of a penal law, and avoid a contract which in equity he ought to perform; and nothing could
excuse the defendant, but his giving express notice to the plaintiff
that he, the deiendant, did not meanto pay the note."
The present is a much stronger case for the plaintiffs than the one
just quoted. The defendant, as before stated, knew all the facts of,
the case; she had paid, at different times, parts of the debt; nearly
five years had elapsed from the date of the contract till its final
payment; there was no evidence that the executors had any knowledge bf illegality-in the contr-act; the suit was not brought on the
contract said to be tainted with usury, but upon the covenant of the
defendanti stipulating to indemnify the testatrix against the payment of the debt, which the6 hlaintiffs had been compelled to pay
under these circumstances. She sets up the alleged usury, between
her and Alexander, to defeat her bond of indemnity; and insists
that she is entitled to the benefit of it, unless the plaintiffs prove
that they gave her notice before they paid the debt. That she was
bound to give notice of her intended defence has already been
shown; and to remove all doubt on these points, we refer to 8
Wend. Rep. 452, to show that she was not entitled to notice.
To permit the defendant to avail hexself of the plea of usury,
under the circumstances of this case, would be to encourage the
grossest fraud and injustice. The plaintiffs paid the balance of the
debt to Alexander, in the regular discharge of their duty as e c cutors, without knowledge or notice of the alleged usury. We
therefore think that the Circuit Court erred in'refusing the first and
