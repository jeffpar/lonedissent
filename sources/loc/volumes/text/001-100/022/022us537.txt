ddlivered the

opinion of theCourt.

The declaration in this cause contains two
counts. The first is against the defendant, Torrance, as endorser of a promissory note, made by
Spencer & Dunn, payable to Sylvester Dunn,
and endorsed by him to the defendant, Torrance,
by whom it was. endorsed to H. J. Lowrie, and by
him to the plaintiff. The 'Other count is, fot
money bad' and :-ceived by the defendant to the
plaintiffs' usei.
The declaration states the plaintiffs to be citi,zeim of New-Yorkj.and the defendant to be a
"ditizen of Missaip1pi, but is silent respecting the
citizenship or residence of Lowrio, the immediate
endorser of Torrance, through whom the plaintitfs trace their title to the money for which; the
suit is instituted.
The case of Yong v. Orym, (6 Mhew. Re.
146.) has decided, that an endorsee wbo reaides
in a different State, may sue his immediate endorser, residing in the State in which the -suit is
brought, although that endorser be 4 rosident of
the same -State with the maker of tho note; but
in this case the suit is'brought againt, a remote
eldorser, and the plaintifb, in their declaration,
trace their title through an intermediate enderser,

without showing that this intermediate endorser 1824.
could have sustained his action against the dev.
fendant in the Courts of 'the United States. The
case of Turner v. The Bank of North America, Torrinc.
(4 Dallas, 8.) has decided, that this count doei
not give the Court jurisdiction. But the count
for money had and received to the use of the
plaintiffs, being free from objection, it becomes
necessary to look farther into the case,
The defendant has filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court, in which" he states, that the
promises laid in the declaration 'were made to H.
J. Lowrie, and not to the .plaintiffs, and that the
said H. J. Lowrie and the defendant, are both
citizens of the State of Mississippi. The plaintiffs demurreT -to thia plea, and the defendant
joined in demurrer. On argument, the demurrer
was overruled, the 'plea sustaihed, and judgment
rendered for the defend.ant.
The case is now before the Court on a writ of
error.
The plaintiffs contend that the plea is defective,
because it avers that the said H. J. Lowrie and
the defendant are both citizens of the State of
Mississippi, at the time of the plea ,pleaded, not
that they were citizens of the'said State at the
time the action was brought.
It is quite clear, that the jurisdiction of the
Court depends upon the state of things at the time
of the'action brought, and* tlt after vesting, it
cannot be ousted by subsequent events. Since,
then, one of the counts shows jurisdiction, and
the plea does not contain sufficient matter to deny
