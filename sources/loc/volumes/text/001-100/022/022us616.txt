JUDICIAL SALE.]

The MONTE. ALLEGRE, TENANT, Claimant.
In judicial sales, there is no warranty, express or implied.
Upon a sale by the Marshal, under an order of Cburt, no warranty
is implied.
Neither the Marshal, nor his agent, the auctioneer, has any authority
to warrant the article sold.
Quacre, How far the Marshal is responsible to the vendee, ip his private capacity, if he undertake to warrant, or to do what would
imply a warranty in a private sale ?
Upon an Admiralty proceeding, in rem, where the proceeds bf the
sale are brought into Court, they are not liable to make good a loss
sustained by the purchaser, in consequence of a defect being discovered in the article sold.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of Marvhnnd.
The appellant, Thomas Tenant, filed his petition on the 14th of November, 1821, in the Circuit Court for the Maryland District, setting forth
that at a public sale of part of the cargo of the
ship Monte Allegre, under an interlocutory order
of the District Court, in the case 6f Joaquim Jose
Vasques, Consul-General of Portugal, against the
ship Monte .Allegre, and her cargo, he became
the purchaser of six hundred and fifty-three seroons of Brazil tobacco, part of said cargo, for
which he paid to the Marshal of the Districti under whose superintendence the sale was conducted,
15,495 dollars and 46 cents. That the tobacco
was sold by samples, which were sound and merchantable, and that,' believing the bulk of the to-

bacco correspondedin this respect, with the sampies, he became the purdnasee.
-

terwardsi he exported the. whole of the tobacco
so purchased to Gibraltar;.aad, after its arrival
there,, it was -found, upon examination, to be
whollyunsound and unmerchantable, the greater
part being entirely rotten, and the remainder un.saleable but at very'reduced prices, and was, in
fact, sold for 4,818 dollars and 52 cents.
The appellant, in his petition, further alleges,
that the tobacco received no ddmage in its transportation to Gibraltar, but was, at the time it was
sqld by the Marshal, wholly unsound, rotten, and
unmerchantable: that the cause in which the order
was passed, by virtue of which the tobacco was
sold, was still pending in this Court; and that the
proceeds of said sale remained in the Circuit
Court, under its authority and control; and, thereupon, prayed for such relief, as, upon proof of
the allegations, he might be considered by the
Court entitled to.
To this petition an answer was filed on the 2d
of May, 1822, in the name of Joaquim Jose Vasques, Consul-General of Portugal, on behalf of
the owners of the proceeds of the ship Monte Allegre and her cargo, resisting the claim of the
appellant:
1. Because the Court had no jurisdiction or
power whatever to sustain the petition, inasmuch
as it was calling on the Court to award damages

or on a warranty, as an incident to a cause, in its

zance, the claim being entirely of cm'nion law
Vic M1onte SjurisdictiQn, and could not be made an incident

th& merits. Proofs were taken on both sides, in
tbe Court below, and a decree, pro forma, was
entered by consent, dismissing the petition with
costs; on which the cause was brought by appeal
to this Court.
.Adca 3d.

Mr. Meredith, for the appellant, in answer to
the objection as to defect of jurisdiction, stated,
1. That this claim was an incident to the principal case.'of the Monte Allegre, which bad been
formerly determined in this Court by a deree of
restitution to the original Portuguese owners., The
general rule is, that where a Court has jurisdiction
in the principal question, it has jurisdiction, incidentally, over all interlocutory matters that are
eonnected, with, or arise out of, the original cause.
Iiwould oeem to follow, therefore, that a sale,
made in virtue of an interlocutory decree, by a
Court exercising a rightful and 'exclusive jurisdiction over the cause in which such decree is promounced, must necessarily be considered as an in:
aident. It.could not be *denied,tliat the -interlocutory decree itself was strictly incidental ; and if
-o, the sale must necessarily have the same character, since it and the decree are inseparably connected. The decree and the sile boto depend on
the jurisdiction in the principal cause, and so does

an undoubted power to distribute them according

Allcgre.

to equitable circumstances, and, so long as they
remain within its control, to decide on all claime
respecting them." The answer in this case, however, places the jurisdiction on distinct ground.
It is said, that the claim is in the nature of an
action for a deceit, or on a warranty, which are
actions known only to the common law, and cannot, therefore, be an incident to that which appertains exclusively to the admiralty. Such, however, is not the rule. Whether the original cause
of action be either of admiralty or common law
jurisdiction, all incidental matters follow the jurisdiction of the original cause, whatever tie complexion of those matters, separately considered,
may be.'

2. In judicial sales, the Court has entire control
over the contract. It considers the contract as
made with itself,and will interfere, underequitable
circumstances, to relieve the purchaser, where it
would not interfere in a private contract. This is
the established doctrine in equity.0 The same
principle applies to sales under decrees in the
Court of Admiralty, which executes a "wido
equity."

governed by the stricter rules of the common be
law, it may be brought within those
rules.
The proof shows, conclusively, that this was a sale
by sample, which is equivalent to a warranty ;" and
such warranty extends as well to the soundness and
merchantable condition of the commodity, as to its
particular species., The proof, and the admission
on the record, are conclusive, to show that at the
time of sale the tobacco was unsound and unmerchantable ; and if the sale by sample amounts to a
warrapty, the purchaser was not bound to examine
the tobacco.
Such an examination, if made,
would have been no waiver of the warranty.
4. The Marshal, being the agent of the Court,
.was authorized to sell by sample, that being, according to the proof, the usual and customary mode
of sale ; and this even if he be considered as a
special agent.d The Marshal, however, being the
agent of the Court, in all sales under its dectees,
is to be considered strictly as a general agent,6

.AIr. D. Hoffman, for the respondenis, contended, that the Marshal possessed no power to warrant the quality of- the article sold, he being a
special agent, with limited powers; and that if he
had exceeded the scope of his authority, he could
not thereby implicate the proceeds of the property,
beihg the agent of the Court, and not of the owners. That the limited authority of the Marshal, in
the case of sales by order of the Court, is universally known and acknowledged; that all persons,
therefore, are presumed to purchase on their own
means of judging; and public officers are never*
presumed to possess the same extent of knowledge
in regard to the quality of property sold by them,
as the owners thereof would be presumed to possess.

theilarshal, in any case, to charge the property
or owners by any fraud or warranty.
Andfirst, as to the power of the Court in this
respect: It must be conceded, that the owners
have had no a.gency in this sale; as to them, it
was wholly in invitum. The sale wa6 by the
Court, not by the ownQrs; the Couirt is not even
the agent of the owners pro hac ziec; and as the
purposes of justice demand a sale, and nothing
more, and as Courts are never presumed to know
the quality of property sold under their order, so,
in the present case, the order contains an authority to sell, which, we shall presently show, does not
authorize a warranty. If the appellant's claim be
well founded, in respect to the acts either of the
Court or its agent, it must, as there has been no
express warranty, repose either on the doctrine
that a sound price will insure a sound article, or
this, that a fraudulent representation imposes a
legal obligation on the Court, to the same extent
to which similar representations would bind an individual. The acts of a Court, as such, whatever
the motives of the individuals who compose it, are,
in the eye of the law, wholly uncontaminated by
fraud or. deceit. To that to which the law has
assigned the part of declaring justice, it cannot
impute a vice contradictory of such a character,
nor suppose that the oracles of justice can dicThe distinction between juditate injustice.

thing sold; (2j) on the absolute impracticability Thei'l

of a Court's inquiring into circumstances of qua- AIegre
lity and title in these cases, and the ionsequent
absence ofany reliance, by purchasers, in these
respects; and, (3.) on the total want of .all motive in Courts and their officers, to warrant, defraud, or- misrepresent. On these grounds is it
that the maxim, caveat emptor, emphatically applies to such sales. It is on a similar principle
that all judicial sales are out df the operation of
the statuteof frauds; and this is~by no means because the judicial sale is at auction, for auction
sales- are within the statute, unless they are' also
in pursuaiqce of judicial authority; but it is because'there is a peculiar respect due to judicial
sales. The danger which the statute intended to
guard against, cannot be supposed of such sales.a
On the direct question under consideration,
there are but few cases to be found in the books.
In South Carolina it has been expressly decided,
that, at a Sheriff's sale, caveat emptor is the best
possible rule tlhat can be laid down. The Court
emphatically states, that all who attend such sales
ought to take care and examine into the title, &c.;
that no warranty, express or implied, can. be
raised on the part of the owner, as to whom the
proceeding is compulsory,. nor of the Sheriff,

find s6mething of a contrary doctrine advanced
by Mr. Chancellor Kent, who repudiated Lord
Hardwicke's doctrine in the case of the AttorneyGeneral v. Day, and held that Shbriff's sales are
within the statute of frauds.
The cases on this point, which have been cited
by the appellant's counsel, may be distinguished.
The first is Saville v. SavilleO where it was
merely decided, that while such a purchase before

deposit, which was one tenth of the whole purchase money. It is further to be remarked of this
case, that a quire is added by the learned commentator, " whether this be now the law of the
Court."
Several cases also were cited from Sugden,
all which may be accounted for by their peculiar
circumstances. The sale was i.fieri in every
case; the Master, who conducted the sale, had
all the knowledge possessed by the owndrs, was

the master's power to have .guarded against.a
Having nearly exhausted the common law
sources of information, on this question, I shall
be pardoned for seeking further light in the Roman code, that pure and copious fountain of written reason. It is well known how strict the tEdilitian law was in regard to the obligations of vendors. Not only a sound price warranted a sound
commodity, but the seller was bound to declare
all the faults known to him, nay, was responsible
even for such as were altogether unknown to him.
Yet all the commentators on this edict admit, that
neither the action quanti minoris, redhibitovia,
nor that ex empto, would lie in the case of fiscal
and judicialsales. It appears that where an extravagant price was given for a commodity, the
Romaniaw allowed a diminution of the price, to
*beenforced .by the action quanti minoris, though
the purchaser suggested neither fraud nor warranty. But this applied only to private sales, not
those under public authority. So, if the commodity were unsound, or unfit for its ordinary
purpose, that law compelled the vendor, by the
actio redhibitoria, to take back the property, or
make allowance for its defects; but the policy of

impugned by the redhibitory action. Again, if
The Monte

purchaser resorted to the action ex cmpto; but
this, too, applied only to private sales.
This doctrine is emphatically stated in the Roman code. llud, sciendtnt cst, edictum 4oc ton

effect is Domat, who cites the /Edilitian edict.
"Redhibition and diminution~ of price, on account

in public sales which are made by a depree of a
Court bf justice. For in these sales it is not the
proprietor who sells, but it is the nmthority of justice, which adjudges the, thing only such as it is. '
Pothier, commenting on the clause, "tamen illud
sciendum est," says, that this exclusion of responsibility on the .part of the owner of property, is
owing to the trust and confidence reposel in Courts
of justice: their sales, therefore, must stand; they
shall not be annulled by the action ex cmpto,. nor
the price be reduced by the action quanti minoris
or 'redhibitoria." " Propter auctoritatem hastm

are not wanting in the jurispruldence of other
countries. In Holland and the Netherlands, certain purchasers have -the privilege of rescinding
their contracts within twenty-four hours, if the
inequality of the transaction exceeds one half the
price paid. But it is said, that this right does not
appertain to any sales made under a decree, or in
the presence of a Judge, and that it certainly does
not to Sales on involuntary decrees.' There is
.a similar locus penitentiw accorded tn the inhabitants of these counkries, who, as the same author in substance remarks, "through much internal heat are commonly much inclined to liquor,
and, therefore, in the midst of innocent-drunkenness, are induced -to mislead ind defraud the unwary in their sales and parchases. The persons
thus used may recede within twenty-four hours,

we find what is called an appropriati'onor re-demption right, which gives to the vendor, in certain cases, within a limited time, the privilege of

But it is said that the Marshal was competent
to warrant tile quality of the property sold, or, at
least, that he has (lone so, and that, therefore, it-is
the Court's.duty to adopt his aets,,and to save the
purchaser from loss; This doctrine, we presume,
cai hardly be sound. The Marshal is only a mii sterial agent of the Court- his authority cannot
be more extensive than that whence it flows :derivitivapotestas non potest esse major primitiva. Nay, further, lie was pro hac vice.a special
agent with defined powers; his authority was only
to sell, and sale does not ex vi termini imply even a
warrdnty of the title, much less of the quality of the
commodity sold.- for if the title should be defended
by the Court, it would be only on the ground fint,
as the proceeding was in rem, all the world was a
party, and not on the principle of warranty,either
express or implied. The Marshal, had he been
guilty of fraud, dr exceeded his powers by
warranting the quality of the.tobacco, could only have
subjected himself to personal responsibility, and
not the property; nor could any such excess in the
execution of his powers impose the least obligation on the Court, either to bind the property, or
compel, the owners to ratify his act. The Marshal's authority was to sell, and this, it has often
been deiided, does not convey a power to icarrant.' Again, the acts of an agent beyond the

The Monte

The Marshal is necessarily a special agent only, Allegre.
and his, like all other defined authorities, must be
strictly pursued. He need not be directed-not to
warrant: this is implied - ex 2zatura offco.' He
cannot be presumed to warrant, because between
him and the owners there can be no privity.: An
owner has the requisitei knowledge of the nature'
and. qualifies of his merchandise;, he, and his
agent, the auctioneer, who have the fullest means
of judging, may consequently sometimes impliedly
warrant. But an officer of Court cannot be presumed to warrant any thing, since he sells the products- of.every region of the globe, often without
invoices, letters, description, or 'muniments of
title, and often without seeing, or the possibility of
seeing, the contents of numerous packages, whose
opening might lead to expense or prejudice.
And even with respect-to agents and servants, the
general doctrine is, that they are nQt competent to
implicate tlheir constituents, either by their warranty or their-fraud; though there are many cases
where the principal has been bound, especially in
the sale'of horses, which rests on special grounds,

if the Marshal have warranted the property, it is
a void warranty as to the source whence he derived
his power to sell.
What has been said of the Marshal, appli
with like force to the auctioneer. It may, besid .,
be remarked, that auctioneers are ever considered
as special agents, and that generally they have an
authority to sell only.b The auctioneer's powers
were defined in this case by the character 'of the
source whence he drew them, and this source was
known to every bidder. But where auctioneers are
clothed with a general authority, usage may, and

As to the question of express warranty, or fraud,
it may be laid down as a settled principle, that
purchasers are bound to apply their attention to
those particulars, which may be supposed within
the reach of their observation and judgment ; and
that if they are wanting in that attention where it
would have protected them, they must endure the
loss, unless -in the case of an express warranty, or
of gross fraud.

cutory decree, which molst have been either under "he'nt

or the arbitrary mandate of the CourL The
decree itself, however, seemed to imply the perishable state of the property ;. and besides, interlocutory decrees for the sale of property are seldom allowed, unless from some such necessity.
This alone was sufficient to put the party on the
inquiry. A Court, also, and its officers, (unlike
owners,) cannot be presumed acquainted with the
quality and condition of the property offered for
sale; and the nature of the property itself (as we
shall presently see) excluded the possibility of
the Marshal or his agent's possessing any knowledge not equally within the reach of the purchaser's observation. These circumstances bring the
case-entirely within the position just laid down,.
and more extensively expressed and well illustrated, in Fonblanque." It is a rule of law, no less

further, a purchaser is not presumed to have been
put off his guard, and diverted from his inquiry, by
the vendor's commendation of the goods. Even
under the _Edilitian edict,' the maxim was simplex
commendatio non obligat; for though thatlaw
aimed at producing the utmost good faith in sales,
yet it was also a rule of the civil code, that "in
buying and selling, the law of nations connives at
some cunning and overreaching ;" in pretio emptionis et venditionisnaturalitur licet contrahentibus se circumvenire; and our law has adopted
these principles, in regardboth to comme. dation
and enhancement of price. We are, then, brought
to the inquiry, first, whether the soundness of the
price paid will entitle the purchaser to a sound article, or to compensation for its defects ; "econdly,
whether there has been a sale by sdmple in this
case, and what is the true meaning of, and1 obligation flowing from, a sale by sample.
Admitting a sound price to have been paid for
this tobacco, we contend, first, that this doesnot,
in our law, insure a sound and merchantable commodity., Every common law author, Wooddeson
excepted," sustains this position. "In the civil
law," says Lord Coke, "a sound price demands d
sound article; but it is not so in the common law,
in which there must be eitheofiaud or an express
warranty.b Wooddeson's pcition is unsustained

Wooddeson's doctrine has been adopted only in Auleg.
thetwo Carolinas, aidbya few elementary writers
in this country., We might go even farther, and
say, that if the vendor not only receivea a full price,
but affirms the goo~ls to be sound, neither the fulness of the price nor the falsity of the affirmation
will oblige him to a diminution of the price-' An
implied warranty as to quality, is wholly unknown
to the common law, all the cases of implied warranty being applicable to title only.e The only
exception to this, may be in the sale of provisions,
which, if unsound, are positively noxious. But
even this exception, thpugh its policy is obvioue,
is denied.d The same doctrine has also been
maintained in equity.c No implied warranty, then,
can be inferred, either from the fulness of the
price, or from any affirmation having been made.
And even in those Courts where a, sound price has
been held to'imply a warranty of the soundne a of.

A sample is a portion of the bulk of a commodity, exhibited by the owner or his agent, with the
intention-to induce persons to buy, expressing the
owner or agent s knowledge of the general character of the whole, and his willingness to warrant
to the purchaser that the bulk shall correspona in
all material respects with the part exhibited. It
is a symbolical expresi warranty, being conventional, and as much expressive of intention as
words. Thus we preserve tha harmony of the
law, which 'excludes all zmphec warranty as to

owners an additional sacrifice of theii property,

contrary, growing out of the illegal and wrongful
acts of others. Such a result, in order to receive
the sanction of a Court of justice, ought to be
called for by some plain and well settled principles of law 6r equity. It -may be said that the
appellant is not chargeable .with any of the miscondtict imputable to those who have occasioned
the loss upon the Mfont6 Allegre and her cargo.
But'when one of two innocent persons mustsuffer,

The proceedings to obtain the order of sale of

for which he now seeks indemnity, has come upon
him by his own negligence.

agency, directly or indirectly, in the sale of the
tobacco; he, of course, cannot be chargeable with
fraud, and this alone would be sufficient to roj6ct
any claim on this ground. But any allegation of
fraud is not better supported against the Marshal
or auctioneer. The petition does not allege directly, and in terms, fraudulent conduct in any
one; but only states, that from the representations of the Marshal and auctioneer, the petitioner, and other purchasers, believed the tobacco
to be sound and merchantable, and that under
such belief he became a purchaser, at a fair price
for sound and merchantable tobacco. Whether
this allegation is sufficient to let in an inquiry at
all upon the question of fraud, is unnecessary to
examine, because, if sufficiently alleged, it is
wholly unsupported by proof. No witness undertakes to-say that the Marshal made any representations whatever respecting the tobacco; and the
Marshal himself testifies that he was present at
the: sale, which wasmade by the auctioneer under
his direction, and that he gave him no instructions,
other than telling him it was public property, and
was to be sold as it was, and by order of the
Court. Nothing was, therefore, done by the
Marshal, calculated to mislead or deceive purchasers. And the auctioneer testifies that he knew

that he teceived from the Marshal no instructions

deception intended or practised in the sale. And

that this was true, so far as respected himself, is
fully confirmed. by the fact, that the house of
which he was a partner, after the sale, and before
the shipment to Gibraltar, purchased o-e third of
the tobacco from the appellant.
There is, therefore, no colour for charging any
onewith fraudulent conduct in the sale of the tobacco. And, indeed, this did not seem, on the
argument, to be relied upon as a distinct and independent ground for relief, but only to be brought
in aid of the claim, on the ground of warranty,
which we proceed next to examine.
It was made a question on the argumept, by the
counsel for the appelle.e, whether the evidence in
the case warranted the conclusion, 'that the tobacco, at the-time'of the sale, was in as deteriorated a state .as it was found at Gibraltar? According to the view taken by the Court of the
case, this inquiry becomes wholly unnecessary.
It would be very reasonable to conclude, that if
the tobacco was in. r decaying condition at the
time of sale, it would become more injured by
lapse of time. But, were the inquiry necessary,
the agreement of the counsel, filed the 18th of
May, 1822, would seem to put that question at

that all such sales carry with them a guarantyy
that the article, in bulk, is of the same quality, in
all respects, ,as the sample exhibited. If the rules
of law which govern sales by sample, are at all
applicable to this case, it becomes necessary. to
ascertain by whom the warranty is made. In private traulsactions, no difficulty on this head can
arise. A merchant, who employs a broker to sell
his goods, knows, or is presumed to know, the
state and condition of the .article he offlers for
sale; and *if the nature or situation of the property is such that it cannot be conveniqntly examined ill bulk, he has a right, and it is for the
convenience of trade that he should be 'permitted,
to select a portion, and exhibit it as a specimen or
sample of the whole;. and that he should be held
responsible for the truth of such representation.
The -broker is his special agent for this purpose,

to bind his principal. In such cases, if the article does not coriespond with the sample, the injured purchaser knows where to look for redress;
and the owner is justly chargeable with the loss,
as he was bound to know the condition of his own
property, and to send out a fair sample, if be undertook to sell in that way.

there is
no warranty. no analogy whatever to such practice.
The pro.

Nor can the Marshal, or auctioneer,. while acting
within the scope of their authority, be considered;
in any respect whatever, as warranting the property sold. The Marshal, from the nature of the
transaction, must-be ignorant of the partidular state
and condition of' the property. He is the.mere
minister of the law, to execute the order 6f the
Court; and a dup discharge of his duty does not require m6re, than that lie should give to purchasers
a fair opportunity of examining, and informing
themselves of the nature and-condition of the property offeiid for sale. An ouctiodeer, in the ordiniary discharge of -his duty, is only an agent t'
sell; and in the present case, he acted only as the
special agent of the Marshal, without any. authority, express 'or implied, to go beyond the single
act of selling the goods. And the Marshal, as an
officer to execute the orders of the Court, has no
authority, in his official character, to . do any act
thatshall, expressly or impliedly, bind any one.by
warranty." If he.steps out of his official duty, and
does what the law has given him no authority to do;
he may make himself personally responsible, 'and
the injured party must look to him for redress.
With that question, however, we have not, necessarily, any concern at present. But in that point
of view, we see- nothing. in the present case, to
justify the conclusion,.- that the Marshal went beyond what-w'as strictly his official duty. This was
not a sale by-sample, according to tle mercantile

amining, the article in bulk ; and, at all events, is
not chargeable with negligence, if he omits to
make the examination, which he has it in his power to do. Although most of the witnesses speak of
the tobacco exhibited at tOe auction, as a sample,
we must look at the whole transaction, and see
what is the judgment of law upon it, and not be
governed- by what may be miscalled a sample.
The Marshal denies that he ever authorized the
atctioneer to sell by sample; he says he saw some
seroons opened, but he supposed it was to show
the description of property, or the species of goods
offered for sale ; that he never examined the tobacco himself, and knei nothing about it; that he
never did sell by sam, le,* and never conceived
himself authorized so to do ; and the auctioneer
does not pretend to have tad any authority or instructions from the Marshal to sell by sample.
Whatever, therefore, from the testimony of the
auctioneer, bears the appearance of a sale by sam-.
pie, was of his own mere motion 'and without authority; and if the appellant has been misled by
any one, it must have been the auctioneer; and if
he has exceeded his authority, so as to make biwself personally responsible, redress, if at all to be
had, must be from him alone ; and in examining
his testimony, it ought not to bre lost sight of, that,
after the sale, he became interested in the purchaue,
and probably looks to the event of this suit for indemnity for his own loss. But his testimony, when

thetime of the sale ; that fifteen or twenty seroons

by which the whole quantity was sold. But he
also states, that the ftode in which this tobacco
wat sold, is- the vual and ordinary mode in
which merchandise is generally sold at auction,
when no specifid directions'to the contrary are given. This shows very satisfactorily, that he did
not understand the sale to be by samp., in the legal sense of the term, so as to carry with it a *arranty. For sales at auction, in the usual mode,
are never understood to be accompanied by a warranty. Auctioneers-are special agents, and have

It is true that the proceeds of the ionte Allegro

may be subject to the order of this Court, if a
proper case was made out, which, in law or
equity, fixed a charge upon this fund. These proceeds are in Court as the property of the original
owners, and for distribution only. And if such
owners would not be liable at law for the loss upon
the tobacco, it is not perceived that any principles
of justice or equity will throw such loss upon their
property. The principle, if well founded, cannot depend upon the contingency, whether.or not
the proceeds shall happen to remain in Court until
the defect in the article sold is discovered. If the
proceeds are liable, they ought to be followed into

lant. The case of Savile v. Savile, (I P. Wins.
746.) is not at all analogous. The application.
there, was to compel the purchaser of certain property to complete his contract, he wishing t6 forfeit his deposit, and go no farther ; and the question was, whether he should be compelled to go
on and complete the contract: and the Court
permitted him to forfeit the deposit, considering it
a hard bargain, not fit to be executed. But, in
the case before us, the contract was executed.
Every thing respecting it had been consummated
months before the discovery of the damaged condition of the tobacco. The property had been
delivered, and the consideration money paid; and
the bargain was as much beyond the control of the
Court, as if the discovery of the defect had been
made years afterwards. We are, therefore, brought
back to the question, whether, in sales like the
present, the rule caveat emptor is to be applied;
and thinking, for the reasons already suggpsted,
that it is, the decree of the Circuit Court, dismissing the petition, must be affirmed.
