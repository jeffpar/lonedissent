In general, the debtor has a right o wake the appropriation of payments; if he omits it, th6 creditor may mako.it: but neither part'

In cases of long and running accounts, where balances are adjusted,
merely for the purpose of making rests, the law..will apply payments to extinguish the debts, accordingto tbe.priority of time.

This was an action of debt, commenced by the
United States, in the Court below; against the
defendants in erior, J Kirkpatrick and others, as
the obligees of a b6nd, given by them to the United States, on -the 4th of December, IiMa, conditioned for the true and faithful discharge of the
.luties of the office of Collector of direct taxes
and internal duties, by Samuel.M. Reed, who had
been appointed to that office by the President, on
the 11th of November, 1813, and, by the terms
of his commission, was to hold his office during
the pleasure of the President, "and until the end
of the next session of the Senate of the United
States, and no longer." - Qn the 24th of January,
1814,i.he was re-appointed to the same office, by
the President, by and with thu advice and consent
of the Senate, and by the ne* commission issued
to him, was to hold hig office "during the pleasure
of the President of the United States, for the
time .being." The pleadings upon vihich the
cause 'was tried in the Court below, were extremely infor.mal and confused, but they resulted
.- substantially in the. following questions of laii

upon which the Judge instructed the jury, and a
.bilI1.of exceptions was taken.
Whether the liability of the sureties
to the
bond, was limited to the duties and.'obligations
imposed upon the Collector by the act of the 22d
of July, 1813, ch. 16, and othej acts relating to
the assessment and collection of direct taxes and
internal duties, passed antecedent to the execution
of the bond, thus excluding the liability for moVOL.IN.

this point, the Court below instructed the jury that
the responsibility of -he sureties did nbt extend to
the obligations created by the subsequent statutes.
2. Whether the jury were at liberty to impute
Isches to.the government, from the delay of the
proper Qficers to call the Collector to. account, at
the periods prescribed by.law, from the year 1814
to 1818 ? The Court left it to the jury to decide
'whether, wider the circumstances of the case, the
Government had not waived ita.resort.to the. sureties.
S. Whether -the responsibility- of the sureties
extended beyond the duration ol the first.ornmission
Upon this point, ..the-Court. below oharged.
the jury, that the responsibility of the sureties
extended to.the re-appointment' of the Collectnr
under::the -new commission, until his duties ana
obligations. were varied by the statutes enacted
"subsequent to.the date of the bond.
4.. How-the. payments, which had' been made
by.the Collector) were to be appropriated? The
balance found due in each account, had been carried forward to the succeeding account, and the
Court was of opinion, that the Government could
not-make the appropriation, at the time of the trial,
so as to apply the payments to the extinguishment'
ofdebts due subsequent to the titne when the
sureties ceased to be" liable.
Upon these instructions a verdict was found for
the defendants, upon which a judgment was rondered in' the Court below,' and the cause was
brought by -writ of error-to this Court.

that where debts are due on'two different accountA,
the debtor may make the application to either, at
the time of payment. But, if he omit to do it,

Mr, Alexander and Mr. Foster,contra, contended, (1.) that the bond entered into by the defendants in error, was'no farther obligatory-on them,
than for.the faithful performance of the official duties of Reed, during the continuance of the appointment recited in the condition. The first commission was to continue in force, by its own terms,
only until the end of the next session of the,Senate;
and the new commission was a .revocation of it.
Being with the advice and consent of the'Senate, it
is by a different authority, and the President,might
have'-nominated a different person. By carrying
forward the balance due by Reed, under the first

the express duty of the public officers to prosecute
diligently, and with effect, the suits which had been
commenced agaifist the principal ; and their neglect to perform this duty, actually occasioned the
loss for which the sureties were sought to be made
responsible. So, also, in the exchequer case of

was laid upon coals, by a statute passed subsequent to the giving of the bond by the Collector,
under which statute a ncy deputation was given,
and new security taken; it was,.thereforo, very

ir. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the March90t.
Court.
In -this case, the Court cannot but lament the
extreme irregularity and laxity of the pleadings,
if, indeed, the informal minutes upon the record
be entitled, in any measure, to the appellation
of pleadings. Some apology is, indeed, to be
found in the asserted inaccurate local practice in
the State Courts; but it is impossible, without
breaking down the best settled principles of law,
not to perceive that the very errors in the pleadings are, of themselves, sufficient to justify a reversal of the judgment, and an award of a re-.
pleader.- The agreement. of the parties, filed in
the case, may, indeed, help the formal defects,
but cannot be admitted to dispense with the substance of appropriate pleas; for, otherwise, it
would be difficult to ascertain what was tried,
or to be tried; and we might as well dispense with
the declaration itself, as with the subsequent pleadings. It is to be hoped that, in future, a more corVOL. IX.

Court below. The first is, .that the Judge limited
the responsibility of the surpties upon the Collector's bond, -to the duties and obligations imposed
by the acts of Qongress, antecedentlypassed, thus
excluding the liability created by the subsequent
statutes. The second is, the direction of the Judge,
that the jury were at liberty to impute laches to
the Government, from the delay to call .the Collector to account, at the periods prescribed by
law, and the consequent injury to the sureties.
The third is, the direction,.that the.paymonts made
by the Collector might, under the circumstances,
be applied to the discharge of the balance due
from collections made under the acts which were
in force when the bond was given.

of direct taxes. But the s~bsequent acts, (act of
the 24th of July, 1813, ch. 21. s. 14., and ch. 24.
s.6., and ch. 25. s. 3. and s. 10., and the act of
the 3d'of August, 1813, ch. 38. s. 2. and s. 5.,.
and ch. 51. s.13.) laying internal duties, contain
provisions enlarging -the authority of the Colleetor- aid the act of 2d:of August, 1813, ch. 55.,
expressly extends the liability under tht bond, to

theie is no doubt that, as to bonds subsequently
giveb, the language of.the condition is to receive
an interpretation'which shall secure the fidelity of
the Collect& under all these acts. The Collector, whose bond is in question, was appointed by
the Piesident, on the llth of November, 1815,

hold his office during the pleasure of the President,

the act, and is, by express.terms; limited to continue to the " end of the next session of the -Senate, and no longer." It follows, therefore, both
by the enactment of law and the form of the grant,
thatv the first commission -must have expired of
itself at that- period; and, as the next,sdssion df

such an effect is not pretended, and would be ir- 1824.
reconcilable with the terms and intent of the commission. It has been suggested, that the practice

be entitled to, in cases of doubtful construction, it
can have no influence to.change the clear language
of the law. In short, if the nomination to, and approval by the Senate, was a, mere confirmation,
and not equivalent to a niew appointment, -there
was no necessity for the second. commission; and
yet, the argument supposes, that it could not be
dispensed with; for if no commission bad been

laches is not imputable to the Government;. and
this maxim is founded, not in the notion ^of extraordinary prerogative, but upon a great. public
policy. The government can transact its business only through its agents ; and its fiscal operations are so various, and its agencies so numerous
and scattered, that the utmost vigilance Would inot
save the public from"the Iiiost serious losses, if the
doctrine of laches can be applied to its transactions.. It-would, in effect, work a repeal of all its
securities. On the other hand, the mischiefs to
the agents and their sureties would be sparcely
less tolerable. -For if, where the laws, as in the

overrule the settled principles of law, but it i certWinly entitled to great weight, where a new doctrine is to, be promulgated. It is-admitted, that
mere laches, unaccompanied with fraud, forms no
discharge of a contract 6f this nature, between
private individuals. Such is tle clear r9sult of the
authorities. Why, then, should a more rigid principle be applied to the government? a principle

to this as their security. But these pro.visions of
the law are created by the Government for its own
securityand protection, and to regulate the conduc t

latter does not undertake to guaranty such fideliC

of the doctrine, except that of. The Peoplev. Jansen, in 7 Johns.Rep. 332. In respect-to that case,
it may be observed, that it is distinguishable from
the present in some of its leading circumstances.
But if it -were not, we -are not prepared to yield to
its authority. It is encountered by other authorities, which have been cited at the bar; and the total silence in the English books, in a case of so
frequent occurrence, affords strong r ehson to believe, that it never has been supposed, that laches
would be fatal in the case cf" the Government,
where it-would not affect private persons. With out-going more at large into this question, w eare

The last ground respects the manner in which Approprialon

the Court below laid down the law respecting
appropriation of payments. -In our opinion, there
is no error in the charge on this point. The general doctrine is, that the debtor has a right, if he
pleases, to make the appropriation of payments;
if he omits it, the creditor may make it; if both
omit it, the law will apply the payments, according to its own notions of justice. It is certainly
too late for either. party to claim a right to make
an appropriation, after the controvcrsy has arisen,

Upon the whole, it is the opinion of the Court,
that for the error of the District Court, on the question of laches, the judgment ought to be reversed,
