Judgment afflrmed.

MIELER ET AL. v. DALE ET AL.
1. In an action of ejectment for land in California, where both parties asserr
title to the premises, - the plaintiff under a concession of the former government, confirmed by the tribunals of the United States, and an approved
survey under the act of Congress of June 14, 1860; and the defendant under
a patent of the United States issued upon a similar confirmed concession, the inquiry of the court must extend to the character of the original concessions to ascertain which of the two titles gave the better right to the
premises ; and, if these do not furnish the means for settling the controversy, reference must be had to the proceedings before the tribunals and
officers of the United States by which the claims of the parties were determined.
'. Where the original concessions in such cases were without specific boundaries,
being floating grants for quantity, the one first located by an approved survey appropriated the land embraced by the survey.
S. The object of the proceeding before the tribunals of the United States for the
approval of a survey of a confirmed claim to land in California under a
Mexican or Spanish grant, pursuant to the act of Congress of June 14,1860
(12 Stat. 34), was to insure conformity of the survey with the decree of
confirmation, and not to settle any question of title against other claimants.
The approval of the court established the fact, that the survey was in conformity with the decree of confirmation; or, if the decree was for quantity
only, that the survey was authorized by it, and is conclusive as to the location of the land against all floating grants not previously located.

real property situated in the county of Santa Clara, in the
State of California. The plaintiffs assert title to the premises
under a concession of the former government, confirmed by the
tribunals of the United States, and an approved survey under
the act of Congress of June 14, 1860 (12 Stat. 34, sect. 5).
That act gives to an approved survey upon a confirmed claim
the effect and validity of a patent. Some question is made,
whether this effect can be given to a survey approved, like the
one here, since the repeal of the act, notwithstanding the reservation of jurisdiction in pending cases by the repealing clause.
We do not deem it material to determine the question, and, for
the purposes of this case, shall consider that the plaintiffs stand
before the court upon a title as fully established as if supported
by a patent. The confirmation under which they claim was
made by the District Court of the United States in January,
1859; and the survey was approved by that court in June, 1865,
and, on appeal, by the Circuit Court in September, 1866.
The defendants assert title to the premises under a patent
issued upon a concession of the Mexican government, confirmed
by the tribunals of the United States; the confirmation dating
in March, 1857, and the patent being issued in January, 1859.
The approved survey of the plaintiffs and the patent of the
defendants both include the land in controversy. The question, therefore, for consideration, is, which of the two titles
gave the better right to the premises. To answer this question,
we must look into the character of the original concessions;
and, if they furnish no guide to a just conclusion, we must seek
a solution in the proceedings had before our tribunals and officers by which the claims of the parties were determined.
Looking at the original concessions, we find that they were
mere licenses to settle upon and occupy vacant lands of the
former government, without designation as to locality, except
in the most vague and general way. It appears that one Mariano Castro, through whom the plaintiffs trace their title, had,
as early as 1802, obtained permission from the Viceroy of Mexico
to settle upon a tract of land within the jurisdiction of Monterey, known as La Brea; but, objection to his settlement there
being made by the priests of the adjoining mission, he was
direated to select another tract. He accordingly solicited of the

Oct. 1875.]

MILLER ET AL. V. DALE ET AL.

military commander of the district the tract called El Carneadero, alleged to be the same tract since known as Las Animas:
but whether any action was ever taken by the public authorities upon his petition, further than to hear objections also made
by the priests to his settlement there, we are not informed; and
the archives of the department, searched by direction of the
governor, disclose nothing on the subject. After Castro's death,
his widow, in 1833, in a petition to the governor, represented
that her husband had taken possession of the tract, Las Animas,
in 1806, under a concession from the governor, but that she had
not the title-papers, and asked that a title be issued to her. In
1835 her attorney renewed the application, affirming that the
land had been granted to her husband, but that the title-papers
had been destroyed by fire. Upon receipt of this petition, the
governor ordered a search among the archives of the department
for a record of the alleged concession; but, as already stated,
none was found. In consideration, however, of the evidence
which they afforded of the right to the tract under the name
of La Brea, obtained by the deceased from the vice-royal government in 1802, the governor directed that a certificate or testimonial of the record in the case (expediente) be issued for the
protection of the parties interested; and, as the boundaries had
not been expressly defined within which they must confine themselves, he added that those set forth in the plat accompanying
the petition of the attorney should in future be regarded as
such, with a reservation, however, of the rights of any third
party who might feel agrieved by the proceeding. This certificate or testimonial, issued in 1835, with the documents upon
which it was founded, constituted the record evidence of the
concession upon which the confirmatidn and survey were had
under which the plaintiffs claim.
Previous to the issue of this document, and in 1831, another
person by the same name, Mariano Castro, under whom the
defendants claim, had obtained from the governor of California a license to occupy for cultivation a tract of land called
El Solis. Under this license he went into possession of vacant
land, and remained in possession until the cession of the country to the United States. His widow and children obtained
the decree of confirmation and patent.

MILLER ET AL.

v. DALE ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

Neither of the concessions transferred the title, or conferred
upon the grantees any interest in the land occupied by them
-other than a right of possession during the pleasure of the government. Their possession under these licenses did not raise
even an equity in their favor against the United States. Serrano v. United States, 5 Wall. 461. In this condition of the
property, the party who first obtained a confirmation of his
claim, and its definite location by an approved survey, took the
title to the land embraced by the survey.
But, independent of this position, if we could regard the original concessions- the one issued to the first Castro in 1802,
and the one issued to the second Castro in 1831 -as
ordinary
grants of the governor of the department, and, as such, passing
a title, though of an imperfect character, to the grantees, the
same result would follow; for they could then be treated only
as floating grants. Neither of them gave any definite boundaries to the tract referred to by the general designation of place,
and neither specified any quantity: that was only a matter of
inference from subsequent documents. And equal vagueness
as to the location and extent of the land solicited characterized
the petitions of the parties. That of the first Castro only stated
that La Brea was situated within the jurisdiction of Monterey,
and distant three or four leagues from any mission or pueblo.
The term appears to have been applied to a large region of
country in that district. The petition of the second Castro
only described El Solis, the tract which he desired, as a place
within the jurisdiction of the same military post. Under these
circumstances, the concessions being without specific boundaries by which the quantity embraced, when ascertained, could
be identified, the only rule which the court can follow in actions
at law is to consider the one first located by an approved survey
as having appropriated the land covered by the survey. This
rule was substantially recognized in one of the earliest cases
which came before this court for consideration, -the Fremont
Case, reported in the 17th of Howard. The grant to Alvarado,
tiuder which Fremont claimed, was for ten leagues within exterior boundaries embracing a much greater quantity; and while
the court held, that, as between the government and the grantee,
the grant passed to him a right to the quantity of land men.

MILLER ET AL. v. DALE ET AL.

tioned, to be laid off by official authority in the territory described, it said, that, if any other person within those limits
had afterwards obtained a grant from the government by specific boundaries before Alvarado had made his survey, the title
of the latter grantee could not be impaired by any subsequent
survey of Alvarado. "As between the individual claimants
from the government," the court added, "the title of the party
who had obtained a grant for the specific land would be the
superior and better one; for, by the general grant to Alvarado,
the government did not bind itself to make no other grant
within the territory described until after he had made his
survey." Referring to this language in the recent case of
HensTlaw v. Bissell, 18 Wall. 267, -we observed that "a second
floating grant, the claim under which is first surveyed and patented, and- thus severed from the public domain, would seem
to stand, with reference to an earlier floating grant within the
same general limits, in the position which the subsequent grant
with specific boundaries mentioned in the citation -would have
stood to the general grant to Alvarado."
Upon this rule the land department of our government constantly acts with reference to floating warrants issued under the
legislation of Congress to soldiers and others. The warrant
first located takes the land, though it bear date only of yesterday. The date of the warrant is of no moment. So with
Mexican floating grants, except that they are usually confined
within certain general limits: the one first located takes the
land. Here the survey of the defendants was made and approved in 1858, several years before the approval of the survey
under which the plaintiffs claim.
It is contended with much earnestness, that the fact that the
survey of the plaintiffs received the approval of the district
and circuit courts of the United States gave it conclusive
efficacy upon the title, and determined that it was superior to
that of the defendants. This position is based upon a misconception of the object of subjecting surveys of confirmed claims
under Mexican concessions to the consideration of the court.
It -was not to settle the question of title: so important a matter
affecting the rights of parties as that would hardly have been
left to proceedings of a summary character. The object of the
proceeding was to insure conformity of the survey with the

MILLER ET AL. V. DALE ET AL.

[Sup. Or.

decree upon which it was made. If the decree gave specific
boundaries, the court was to see that the survey followed them:
if the decree was for quantity, the court was to see that the survey did not embrace a greater quantity; that the land was
taken in a compact form, or if the grantee had himself exercised a right of selection, and had settled upon and improved
particular parcels, or sold parcels to others, that the survey, if
practicable, included such parcels, and also that it was made
with proper regard to the rights of others who had settled upon
the land, especially when they had been induced to make improvements by the grantee himself. Originally surveys were
left entirely to the action of the local surveyor and the land
department. Great complaints were sometimes made that surveys thus established were unjustly extended in directions so as
to include the settlements and improvements of others; and
contests over them were, in consequence, often prolonged for
years. To prevent possible abuses in this way, the act of Congress of June 14, 1860, was passed, allowing surveys, when
objection was made to their correctness, to be brought before
the court and subjected to examination, and requiring them to
be corrected if found to vary from the specific directions of the
decrees upon which they were founded; or, if the decrees contained no specific directions, from the general rules governing
in such cases. The approval of the court established the fact,
that the survey was in conformity with the decree of confirmation; or, if the decree was for quantity only, that the survey
was authorized by it; and in either case the approval rendered
the survey conclusive as to the location of the land against all
floating grants not previously located. The questions then left
for controversy before the courts related to the title of the
property, the parties proceeding upon the established conformity
of their respective surveys with the decrees upon which they
were founded.
The case of Henshaw v. Bissell, upon which counsel seem to
rely, does not militate against the views here stated. The
question there was not as to which of two floating grants carried the premises. Only one of the grants there under consideration was floating. The other grant had specific boundaries,
or such descriptive features as to render its limits easily ascertainable: and the court held that the right of the grantee to

Oct. 1875.]

MILLER ET AL.

v.

DALE ET AL.

the land thus designated could not be interfered with by the
donee of the floating grant. A grant of that specific description necessarily carried the land described, unless appropriated
by an earlier grant; and no subsequent location of a floating
grant upon the premises could impair the title.
It is urged that the testimonial issued in 1885, although intended primarily as evidence of the proceedings taken in 1802,
and of the license granted by the Viceroy of Mexico, established the boundaries of the settlement of the first Castro; so
that, from that time, the license ceased to be a general and floating one, and became a license to occupy a specific tract. Admitting this view of the effect of the testimonial to be correct,
the answer is obvious,- the title of the grantee or licensee was
not changed by a limitation of his right of occupation to a
specific tract; and the designation of the boundaries reserved
the rights of any third party, which were to be left uninjured,
that is, not encroached upon. The second Castro was then in
possession of a portion of the tract within those boundaries; his
right being of the same character, - that of occupancy by permission of the government. The decree confirming his claim,
and the survey following it, approved by the land department,
are conclusive as to the extent of his possession. The plaintiff
shows no better claim to the premises thus possessed by producing a testimonial establishing the boundaries of his settlement, which at the same time provided that existing rights of
others should remain unaffected by the proceeding.
It was suggested on the argument that the decree confirming
the concession of the El Solis rancho was obtained upon an
erroneous and fraudulent translation of certain documents introduced into the case, which, if correctly translated, would
have defeated the claim by showing that the concession was
denied instead of being made by the Mexican government. If
this be sv, the plaintiffs can proceed in equity, where the land
has not passed to bona fide purchasers without notice, to remove
the obstacle to the operation of their title arising from the defendants' patent, or to compel the patentees to hold the land in
trust for their benefit, or in some other appropriate way. But,
in this action of ejectment, the plaintiffs must rely upon their
legal title; and that arising subsequent to the title of the defendants they cannot recover.
Judgment affirmed.
