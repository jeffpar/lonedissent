[Sup. Ct.

RAILROAD ComwAsY v. FRALOFF.
1. It is competent for general carriers of passengers, by specific regulations,
distinctly brought to the knowledge of the-passenger, which are reasonable, and not inconsistent with a statute or their duties to the public, to protect themselves against liability as insurers of his baggage which exceeds
a fixed amount in value, except upon additional compensation proportioned
to the risk.
2. As a condition precedent to a contract for its transportation, they may require
information from him as to its value, and demand extra compensation for
any excess beyond that which he may reasonably demand to be transported
as baggage under the contract to carry the person.
3. They may be discharged from liability for its full value, if he, by any device
or artifice, evades inquiry as to such value, whereby a responsibility is imposed upon them beyond what they are bound to assume in consideration of
the ordinary fare charged for the transportation of the person.
4. In the absence of legislation, or of special regulations by the carriers, or of
conduct by him misleading them as to such value, his failure to disclose it,
when no inquiry is made of him, is not, in itself, a fraud upon them.
6. To the extent that articles taken by him for his personal use when travelling exceed in quantity and value such as are ordinarily or usually
taken by passengers of like station and pursuing like journeys, they are
not baggage for which the carriers are, by general law, responsible as
insurers.
6. Whether he has taken such an excess of baggage is a question not of law
for the sole or the final determination of the court, but of fact for the
jury, under proper guidance as to the law of the case. Their determination of it upon the evidence-no error of law appearing-is not subject to
re-examination here.
7. Sect. 4281, Rev. Stat., has no reference to the liability of carriers by land for
the baggage of passengers.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the

Southern District of New York.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Air. Elliott F. S/iepard for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. James TV. Gerard, contra.

MR. JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a writ of error to a judgment rendered against the
New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company, in
an action by Olga de Maluta Fraloff to recover the value of
certain articles of wearing-apparel alleged to have been taken
from her trunk while she was a passenger upon the cars of the

RAILROAD Co. v. FRALOFF.

company, and while the trunk was in its charge for transportation as part of her baggage.
There was evidence before the jury tending to establish the
following facts: The defendant in error, a subject of the Czar of Russia, possessing large wealth, and enjoying high social position among
her own people, after travelling in Europe, Asia, and Africa,
spending tome time in London and Paris, visited America in
the year 1869, for the double purpose of benefiting her health
and seeing this country. She brought with her to the United
States six trunks of ordinary travel-worn appearance, containing a large quantity of wearing-apparel, including many elegant, costly dresses, and also rare and valuable laces, which she
had been accustomed to wear upon different dresses when on
visits, or frequenting theatres, or attending dinners, balls, and
receptions. A portion of the laces was made by her ancestors
upon their estates in Russia. After remaining some weeks in
the city of New York, she started upon a journey westward,
going first to Albany, and taking with her, among other things,
two of the trunks brought to this country. Her ultimate purpose was to visit a warmer climate, and, upon reaching Chicago, to determine whether to visit California, New Orleans,
Havana, and probably Rio Janeiro. After passing a day or so
at Albany, she took passage on the cars of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company for Niagara Falls,
delivering to the authorized agents of the company for transportation as her baggage the two trunks above described,
which contained the larger portion of the dress-laces brought
with her from Europe. Upon arriving at Niagara Falls she
ascertained that one of the trunks, during transportation from
Albany to the Falls, had been materially injured, its locks
broken, its contents disturbed, and more than two hundred
yards of dress-lace abstracted from the trunk in -%hich it had
been carefully placed before she left the city of New York.
The company declined to pay the sum demanded as the value
of the missing laces; and, having denied all liability therefor,
this action was instituted to recover the damages which the
defendant in error claimed to have sustained by reason of the
loss of her proberty.

R4TLROAD Co.

v. FRALOFF.

[Sup. Ct.

Upon the first trial of the case, in 1873, the jury, being
unable to agree, was discharged. A second trial took place in
the year 1875. Upon the conclusion of the evidence in chief
at the last trial, the company moved a dismissal of the action,
and,-at the same time, submitted numerous instructions which
it asked to be then given to the jury, among which was one
peremptorily directing a verdict in its favor. That motion
was overruled, and the court declined to irstruct the jury as
requested. Subsequently, upon the conclusion of the evidence
upon both sides, the motion for a peremptory instruction in
behalf of the company was renewed, and again overruled.
The court thereupon gave its charge, to which the company
filed numerous exceptions, and also submitted written requests,
forty-two in number, for instructions to the jury. The court
refused to instruct the jury as asked, or otherwise than as
shown in its own charge. To the action of the court in the
several respects indicated the company excepted in due form.
The jury returned a verdict against the company for the sum
of $10,000, although the -evidence, in some of its aspects,
placed the value of the missing laces very far in excess of that
amount.
It would extend this opinion to an improper length, and
could serve no useful purpose, were we to enter upon a discussion of the various exceptions, unusual in their number, to the
action of the court in the admission and exclusion of evidence,
as well as in refusing to charge the jury as requested by the
company. Certain controlling propositions are presented for
our consideration, and upon their determination the substantial
rights of parties seem to depend. If, in respect of these propositions, no error was committed, the judgment should be
affirmed without any reference to points of a minor and merely
technical nature, which do not involve the merits of the case,
or the just rights of the parties.
In behalf of the company it is earnestly claimed that the
court erred in not giving a peremptory instruction for a verdict in its behalf. This position, however, is wholly untenable. Had there been no serious controversy about the facts,
and had the law upon the undisputed evidence precluded any
recovery whatever against the company, such an instruction

Oct. 1879.]

RAILROAD Co. v. FRALOFF.

would have been proper. 1 Wall. 869; 11 How. 872; 19 id.
269; 22 Wall. 121. The court could not have given such an
instruction in this case without usurping the functions of the
jury. This will, however, more clearly appear from what is
said in the course of this opinion.
The main contention of the company, upon the trial below,
was that good faith required the defendant in error, when
delivering her trunks for transportation, to inform its agents
of the peculiar character and extraordinary value of the laces
in question; and that her failure in that respect, whether intentional or not, was, in itself, a fraud upon the carrier, which
should prevent any recovery in this action.
The Circuit Court refused, and, in our opinion, rightly, to
so instruct the jury. We are not referred to any legislative
enactment restricting or limiting the responsibility of passenger carriers by land for articles carried as baggage. Nor is
it pretended that the plaintiff in error had, at the date of
these transactions, established or promulgated any regulation
as to the quantity or the value of baggage which passengers
upon its cars might carry, without extia compensation, under
the general contract to carry the person. Further, it is not
claimed that any inquiry was made of the defendant in error,
either when the trunks were taken into the custody of the
carrier, or at any time prior to the alleged loss, as to the
value of their contents.- It is undoubtedly competent for carriers of passengers, by specific regulations, distinctly brought
to -the knowledge of the passenger, which are reasonable in
their character and not inconsistdnt with any statute or their
duties to the public, to protect themselves against liability, as
insurers, for baggage exceeding a fixed amount in value, except
upon additional compensation, proportioned to the risk. And
in order that such regulations may be practically effective, and
the carrier advised of the full extent of its responsibility, and,
consequently, of the degree of precaution necessary upon its
part, it may rightfully require, as a condition precedent to any
contract for the transportation of baggage, information from
the passenger as to its value; and if the value thus disclosed
exceeds that which the passenger may reasonably demand to
be transported as baggage without extra compensation, the

28

[Sup. Ct.

carrier, at its option, can make such additional charge as the
risk fairly justifies. It is also undoubtedly true that the carrier may be discharged from liability for thfe full value of the
passenger's baggage, if the latter, by false statements, or by
any device or artifice, puts off inquiry as to such value, whereby
is imposed upon the carrier responsibility beyond what it was
bound to assume in consideration of the ordinary fare charged
for the transportation of the person. But in the absence of
legislation limiting the responsibility of carriers for the baggage of passengers; in the absence of reasonable regulations
upon the subject by the carrier, of which the passenger has
knowledge; in the absence of inquiry of the passenger as to the
value of the articles carried, under the name of baggage, for
his personal use and convenience when travelling; and in the
absence of conduct upon the part of the passenger misleading the carrier as to the value of his baggage, -the court cannot, as matter of law, declare, as it was in effect requested in
this case to do, that the mere failure of the passenger, unasked,
to disclose the value of his baggage is a fraud upon the carrier, which defeats all right of recovery. The instructions
asked by the company virtually assumed that the gneral law
governing the rights, duties, and responsibilities of passenger
carriers prescribed a definite, fixed limit of value, beyond
which the carrier was not liable for baggage, except under a
special contract or upon previous notice as to value. We are
not, however, referred to any adjudged case, or to any elementary treatise which sustains that proposition, without qualification. In the very nature of things, no such rule could be
established by the courts in virtue of any inherent power they
possess. The quantity or kind or value of the baggage which
a passenger may carry under the contract for the transportation of his person depends upon a variety of circumstances
which do not exist in every -case. "That which one traveller," says Erle, C. J., in .Philpot v. Northwestern .Railway Co.
(19 C. B. Nr. s. 821), "would consider indispensable, would be
deemed superfluous and unnecessary by another.
But the
general habits and wants of mankind will be taken in the mind
of the carrier when he receives a passenger for conveyance."
Some of the cases seem to announce the broad doctrine that,

Oct. 1879.]

RAILROAD CO. v. FRALOFF.

by general law, in the absence of legislation, or special regulations by the carrier, of the character indicated, a passenger
may take, without extra compensation, such articles adapted to
personal use as his necessities, comfort, convenience, or even
gratification may suggest; and that whatever may be the quantity or value of such articles, the carrier is responsible for all
damage or loss to them, from whatever source, unless from the
act of God or the public enemy. But that, in our judgment,
is not an accurate statement of the law. Whether articles of
wearing-apparel, in any particular case, constitute baggage, as
that term is understood in the law, for which the carrier is
responsible as insurer, depends upon the inquiry whether they
are such in quantity and value as passengers under like circumstances ordinarily or usually carry for personal use when
travelling. "The implied undertaking," says Mr. Angell, "of
the proprietors of stage-coaches, railroads, and steamboats to
carry in safety the baggage of passengers is not unlimited, and
cannot be extended beyond ordinary baggage, or such baggage
as a traveller usually carries with him for his personal convenience." Angell, Carriers, sect. 115. In Hannibal Railroad
v. ,S&)ft (12 Wall. 272), this court, speaking through Mr. Justice Field, said that the contract to carry the person "only
implies an undertaking to transport such a limited quantity of
articles as are ordinarily taken by travellers for their personal
use and convenience, such quantity depending, of course, upon
the station of the party, the object and length of his journey,
and many other considerations." To the same effect is a decision of the Queen's Bench in -acrozo v. Great Western ailway
CGo. (Law Rep. 6 Q. B. 121), where Chief Justice Cockburn
announced the true rule to be "that whatever the passenger
takes with him for his personal use or convenience, ac.cording
to the habits or wants of the particular class to which he
belongs, either with reference to the immediate necessities or
to the ultimate purpose of the journey, must be considered as
personal luggage." 2 Parsons, Contr., 199. To the extent,
therefore, that the articles carried by the passenger for his
personal ue exceed in quantity and value such as are ordinarily or usually carried by passengers of like station and pursuing like journeys, they are not baggage for which the carrier,

RAILROAD

CO. v.

FRALOFF.

[Sup. Ct.

by general law, is responsible as insurer. In cases of abuse by
the passenger of the privilege which the law gives him, the
carrier secures such exemption from responcibility, not, how
ever, because the passenger, uninquired of, failed to disclose
the character and value of the articles carried, but because the
articles themselves, in excess of the amount usually or ordinarily carried, under like circumstances, would not constitute
baggage within the true meaning of the law. The laces in
question confessedly constituted a part of the wearing-apparel
of the defendant in error. They Were adapted to and exclusively designed for personal use, according to her convenience,
comfort, or tastes, during the extended journey upon which she
had entered. They were not merchandise, nor is there any
evidence that they were intended for sale or for purposes of
business. Whether they were such articles in quantity and
value as passengers of like station and under like circumstances
ordinarily or usually carry for their personal use, and to subserve their convenience, gratification, or comf9rt while travelling, was not a pure question of law for the sole or final
determination of the court, but a question of fact for the jury,
under proper guidance from the court as to the law governing
such cases. It was for the jury to say to what extent, if any,
the baggage of defendant in error exceeded in quantity and
value that which was usually carried without extra compensation, and to disallow any claim for such excess.
Upon examining the carefully guarded instructions given to
the jury, we are unable to see that the court below omitted
any thing essential to a clear comprehension of the issues, or
announced any principle or doctrine not in harmony with
settled law. After submitting to the jury the disputed question as to whether the laces were, in fact, in the trunk of the
defendant in error, when delivered to the company at Albany
for transportation to Niagara Falls, the court charged the jury,
in substance, that every traveller was entitled to provide for
the exigencies of his journey in the way of baggage, was not
limited to articles which were absolutely essential, but could
carry such as were usually carried by 'persons travelling, for
their comfort, convenience, and gratification upon such journeys; that the liability of carriers could not- be maintained to

RAILROAD

CO. V. FRALOFF.

the extent of making them responsible for such unusual articles
as the exceptional fancies, habits, or idiosyncrasies of some
particular individual may prompt him to carry; that their
responsibility as insurers was limited to such articles as it was
customary or reasonable for travellers of the same class, in general, to take for such journeys as the one which was the subject of inquiry, and did not extend to those which the caprice
of a particular traveller might lead that traveller to take ; that
if the company delivered to the defendant in error, aside from
the laces in question, baggage which had been carried, and
which was sufficient for her as reasonable baggage, within the
rules laid down, she was not entitled to recover; that if she
carried the laces in question for the purpose of having them
safely kept and stored by railroad companies and hotel-keepers,
and not for the purpose of using them, as occasion might
require, for her gratification, comfort, or convenience, the company was not liable; that if any portion of the missing articles
were reasonable and proper for her to carry, and all Was not,
they should allow her the value of that portion.
Looking at the whole scope and bearing of the charge, and
interpreting what was said, as it must necessarily have been
understood both by the court and jury, we do not perceive that
any error was committed to the prejudice of the company, or
of which it can complain.. No error of law appearing upon the
record, this court cannot reverse the judgment because, upon
examination of the evidence, we may be of the opinion that the
jury should have returned a verdict for a less amount. If the
jury acted upon a gross mistake of facts, or were governed by
some improper influence or bias, the remedy therefore rested
with the court below, under its general power to set aside the
verdict. But that court finding that the verdict was abundantly sustained by the evidence, and that theie was no ground
to suppose that the jury had not performed their duty impartially and justly, refused to disturb the verdict, and overruled
a motion for new trial. Whether its action, in that particular,
was erroneous or not, our power is restricted by the Constitution to the determination of the questions of law arising upon
the record. Our authority does not extend to a re-examination of facts which have been tried by the jury under instruc-

tions correctly defining the legal rights of parties. Parsons
v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 446; 21 How. 167; Insurance Company v.
Folsom, 18 Wall. 249.
It is, perhaps, proper to refer to one other point suggested
in the elaborate brief of counsel for the company. Our attention is called to section 4281 of the Revised Statutes, which
declares that "if any shipper of platina, gold, gold-dust, coins,
jewelry,

. . .

trinkets, .

.

. silk in a manufactured or unmanu-

factured form, whether wrought up or not wrought up with
any other material, furs or laces, or any of them, contained in
any parcel, package, or bundle, shall lade the same as freight
or baggage on any vessel, without, at the time of such lading,
giving to the master, clerk, agent, or owner of such vessel
receiving the same a written notice of the true character and
value thereof, and having the same entered on the bill of lading
therefor, the master and owner, of such vessel shall not be
liable as carriers thereof in any form or manner; nor shall any
such master or owner be liable for any of such goods beyond
the value and according to the character thereof, so notified
and entered."
It is sufficient to say that the section has no application whatever to this case. It has reference alone to the liability of
carriers by water who transport goods and merchandise of the
kind designated. It has no reference to carriers by land, and
does not assume to declare or restrict their liability for the
baggage of passengers.
Judgmnent affrmed.
Mn . JUSTICE FiEuD, with whom concurred MR. JUSTIcE
MILLER and MR. JUSTICE STROwG, dissenting.
I dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. I do
not think that .two hundred and seventy-five yards of lace,
claimed by the owner to be worth $75,000, and found by the
jury to be of the value of $10,000, can, as a matter of law, be
properly considered as baggage of a passenger, for the loss of
which the railroad company, in the absence of any special
agreement, should be held liable.
