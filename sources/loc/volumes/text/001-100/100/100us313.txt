VIRGNMIA

v. RIVES.

318

VimGunIA v. Rrv-zs.
1. Sect. 641 of the Revised Statutes, which provides for the removal into the
Federal court of any civil suit or prosecution "commenced in any State
court, for any cause whatsoever, against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State, or in the part of the State
where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by
any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States,"
&c., examined in connection with sects. 1977 and 1978. Held, that the
object of these statutes, as of the Constitution which authorized them, was
to place, in respect to civil rights, the colored race upon a level with the
white. They made the rights and responsibilities, civil and criminal, of the
two races exactly the same.
2. The prohibitions of tle Fourteenth Amendment have exclusive reference to
State action. It is the State which is prohibited from denying to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, and, consequently, the statutes founded upon the amendment, and partially enumerating what civil rights the colored man shall enjoy equally with the white
are intended for protection against State infringement of those rights
Sect. 641 was also intended to protect them against State action, and
against that alone.
3. A State may exert her authority through different agencies, and those prohi
bitions extend to her action denying equal protection of the laws, whether
it be action by one of these agencies or by another. Congress, by virtue of
the fifth section of the Fourteenth Amendment, may enforce the prohibitions whenever they are disregarded by either the Legislative, the Executive, or the Judicial Department of the State. The mode of enforcement is
left to its discretion. It may secure the right, that is, enforce its recognition, by removing the case from a State court, in which it is denied, into a
Federal court, where it will be acknowledged.
4. But the Fourteenth Amendment is broader than sect. 641, as the latter does
not apply to all cases in which the equal protection of the laws may be
denied to a defendant. The removal thereby authorized is before trial or
final hearing. But the violation of the constitutional prohibitions, when
committed by the judicial action of a State, may be, and generally will be,
after the trial or final hearing has commenced. It is during the trial of
final hearing the defendant is denied equality of legal protection, and not
until then. Nor can he know until then that the equal protection of the
laws will not be extended to him. Certainly not until then can he affirm
that it is denied. To such a case - that is, to judicial infractions of the
constitutional amendment after the trial has commenced-sect. 641 has
no applicability. It was not intended to reach such cases. They were
left to the revisory power of this court.
6. Therefore, the denial or inability to enforce in the judicial tribunals of a State
rights secured to a defendant by any law providing for the equal civil rights
of all persons citizens of the United States, of which sect. 641 speaks, is
primarily, if not exclusively, a denial of such rights, or an inability to
enforce them, resulting from the Constitution or laws of the State, rather

VIRGINIA

v.

RIvES.

[Sup. Ct.

than a denial made manifest at the trial of the case. In other words, the statute has reference to a legislative denial or an inability resulting from it. By
express requirement of the statute, the party must set forth, under oath,
the facts upon which he bases his claim to have his case removed, not
merely his belief that he cannot enforce his rights at a subsequent stage of
the proceedings. But, in the absence of constitutional or legislative impediment, he cannot swear before his case comes to trial that his enjoyment of
his civil rights is denied to him.
6. The Constitution and laws of Virginia do not exclude colored citizens from
service on juries. The petition for removal did not present a case under
sect. 641.
7. The defendant moved in the State court that the venire be so modified that
one-third or some portion of the jury should be composed of his own race.
The denial of that motion was not a denial of a right secured to him by
any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States,
or by any statute, or by the Fourteenth Amendment. A mixed jury in
a particular case is not essential to the equal protection of the laws. It is
a right to which any colored man is entitled, that, in the selection of
jurors to pass upon his life, liberty, or property, there shall be no exclusion
of his race, and no discrimination against them, because of his color. But
that is..a different thing from that which was claimed, as of right, and
denied in the State court; viz., a right to have the jury composed in part
of colored men.
8. A mandamus does not lie to control judicial discretion, except when that dis
cretion has been abused. But it may be used as a remedy where the case
is outside of that discretion and outside the jurisdiction of the court or
officer to which or to whom the writ is directed. One of its .peculiar and
more common uses is to restrain inferior courts, and keep them within their
lawful bounds.

MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the
facts

-

Burwell Reynolds and Lee Reynolds, two colored men, were
jointly indicted for murder in the county court of Patrick
County, Virginia, at its January Term, 1878. The case having
been removed into the Circuit Court of the State, and brought
on for trial, the defendants moved the court that the venire,
which was composed entirely of the white race, be modified
so as to allow one-third thereof to be composed of colored

men. This motion was overruled on the ground that the
court "had no authority to change the venire, it appearing
(as the record stated) to the satisfaction of the court that the

venIre had been regularly drawn from the jury-box according
to law." Thereupon the defendants, before the trial, filed their
petition, duly verified, praying for a removal of the case into
the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District
of Virginia. This petition represented that the petitioners were
negroes, aged respectively seventeen and nineteen years, and
that the man whom they were charged with having murdered
was a white man. It further alleged that the right secured to
the petitioners by the law providing for the equal civil rights of
all the citizens of the -United States was denied to them in the"
judicial tribunals of the county of Patrick, of which county
they are natives and citizens; that by the laws of Virginia all
male citizens, twenty-one years of age, and not over sixty, wh6
are entitled to vote and hold office under the Constitution and
laws of the State, are made liable to serve as jurors; that this
law allows the right, as well as requires the duty, of the race
to which the petitioners belong to serve as jurors; yet that the
grand jury who found the indictment against them, as well as
the jurors summoned to try them, were composed entirely of
the white race. The petitioners further represented that they
had applied to the judge of the court, to the prosecuting attorney, and to his assistant counsel, that a portion of the jury by
which they were to be tried should be composed in part of
competent jurors of their own race and color, but that this right
had been refused them. The petition further alleged that a
strong prejudice existed in the community of the county against
them, independent of the merits of the case, and based solely
upon the fact that they are negroes, and that the man they
were accused of having murdered was a white man. From
that fact alone they were satisfied they could not obtain an
impartial trial before a jury exclusively composed of the white
race. The petitioners further represented that their race had
never been allowed the right to serve as jurors, either in civil
or criminal cases, in the county of Patrick, in any case, civil or
criminal, in which their race had been in any way interested.
They therefore prayed that the prosecution might be removed

VIRGINIA

v.

RrVES.

into the Circuit Court of the United States.

[Sup.

.

The State court

denied this prayer, and proceeded with the trial, when each of
the defendants was convicted. ThQ verdicts and judgments
were, however, set aside, and a motion for a removal of the
case was renewed on the same petition, and again denied. The
defendants were then tried again separately. One was convicted and sentenced, and a bill of exceptions was duly signed
and made part of the record. In the other case the jury disagreed.
In this stage of the proceedings a copy of the record was
obtained, the cases were, upon petition, ordered to be docketed
in the Circuit Court of the United States, Nov. 18, 1878, which
was at its next succeeding term after the first application for
removal, and a writ of habeas corpus cum causa was issued, by
virtue of which the defendants were taken from the jail of Patrick County into the custody of the United States marshal, and
they are now held in jail subjet to the control of that court.
No motion has been made in the Circuit Court to remand
the prosecutions to the State court, but the Commonwealth of
Virginia has applied to this court for a.rule to show cause why
a mandamus should not issue commanding the judge of the
District Court of the Western District of Virginia, the Hon.
Alexander Rives, to cause to be redelivered by the marshal of
said district to the jailer of Patrick County the bodies of the
said Lee and Burwell Reynolds, to be dealt with according to
the laws of the said Commonwealth. The rule has been granted,
and Judge Rives has returned an answer setting forth substantially the facts hereinbefore stated, and averring that the indictments were removed into the Ciredit Court of the United
States by virtue of sect. 641 of the Revised Statutes.
If the petition filed in the State court before trial, and duly
verified by the oath of the defendants, exhibited a sufficient
ground for a removal of the prosecutions into the Circuit
Court of the United States, they were in legal, effect thus
removed, and the writ of habeas corpus was properly issued.
All proceedings in the State court subsequent to the removals
were coram non judice and absolutely void. This, by virtue of
the express declaration of sect. 641 of the Revised Statutes,
which enacts that, "upon the filing of such petition, all fur-

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA

V. RIVES.

ther proceedings in the State court shall cease, and shall not
be resumed except as thereinafter provided." In Gordon v.
Longest (16 Pet. 97), it was ruled by this court that when an
application to remove a cause (removable) is made in proper
form, and no objection is made to the facts upon which it is
founded, "it is the duty of the State court to ' proceed no further in the cause,' and every step subsequently taken in the
exercise of jurisdiction in the case, whether in the same court
or in the Court of Appeals, is coram non Judice." To the
same effect is Insurance Company v. Dunn, 19 Wall. 214.
It is, therefore, a material inquiry whether the petition of
the defendants set forth such facts as made a case for removal,
and consequently arrested the jurisdiction of the State court
and transferred it to the Federal court. Sect. 64-L of the
Revised Statutes provides for a removal "when any civil suit
or prosecution is commenced in any State court, for any cause
whatsoever, against any person who is denied or cannot enforce
in the judicial tribunals of the State, or in the part of the
State where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right
secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights
of citizens of the United States," &c. It declares that such a
case may be removed before trial or final hearing.
Was the case of Lee and Burwell Reynolds such a one?
Before examining their petition for removal, it is necessary to
understand clearly the scope and meaning of this act of Congress. It rests upon the Fourteenth Amendment df the Constitution and the legislation to enforce its provisions. That
amendment declares that no State shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States, nor shall any State deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws. It was in pursuance of these constitutional provisions that the civil rights statutes were enacted. Sects. 1977,
1978, Rev. Stat. They enact that all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every
State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be
parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all
laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property

VIRGINIA v. RIVES.

[Sup. Ct.

as is enjoyed by whita citizens, and shall be subject to like
punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of
every kind, and to no other. Sect. 1978 enacts that all citizens
of the United St'ates shall have the same right in every State
and Territory as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit,
purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. The plain object of these statutes, as of the Constitu.
tion which authorized them, was to place the colored race, in
respect of civil rights, upon a level with whites. They made
.the rights and responsibilities, civil and criminal, of the two
races exactly the same.
The provisions of the Fcurteenth Amendment of the Constitution we have quoted all have reference to State action
exclusively, and not to Any action of private individuals. It
is the State which is prohibited from denying to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, and
consequently the statutes partially enumerating what civil
rights colored men shall enjoy equally with white persons,
founded as they are upon the amendment, are intended for
protection against State infringement of those rights. Sect.
641 was also intended for their protection against State action,
and against that alone.
It is doubtless true that a State may act through different
agencies, - either by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial
authorities; and the prohibitions of the amendment extend to
all action of the State denying equal protection of the laws,
whether it be action by one of these agencies or by another.
Congress, by virtue of the fifth section of the Fourteenth
Amendment, may enforce the prohibitions whenever they are
'disregarded by; either the Legislative, the Executive, or the
Judicial Department of the State. The mode of enforcement
is left to its discretion. It may secure the right, that is,
enforce its recognition, by removing the case from a State
court inwhich it is denied, into a Federal court where it will
be acknowledged. Of this there can be no reasonable doubt.
Removal of cases from State courts into courts of the United
States has been an acknowledged mode of protecting rights
ever since the foundation of the government. Its constitutionality has never been seriously doubted. But it is still a

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. RIES.

question whether the remedy of removal of cases from State
courts into the courts of the United States, given by sect. 641,
applies to all cases in which equal protection of the laws may
be denied to a defendant. And clearly it does not. The constitutional amendment is broader than the provisions of that
section. The statute authorizes a removal of the case only
before trial, not after a trial has commenced. It does not,
therefore, embrace many cases in which a colored man's right
may be denied. It does not embrace a case in which a right
may be denied by judicial action during the trial, or by discrimination against him in the sentence or in the mode of
executing the sentence. But the violation of the constitutional
provisions, when made by the judicial tribunals of a State,
may be, and generally will be, after the trial has commenced.
It is then, during or after the trial, that denials of a defendant's
right by judicial tribunals occur. Not often until then. Nor
can the defendant know until then that the equal protection of
the laws will not be extended to him. Certainly until then he
cannot affirm that it is denied, or that he cannot enforce it,
in the judicial tribunals.
It is obvious, therefore, that to such a case - that is, a judicial infraction of the constitutional inhibitions, after trial or
final hearing has commenced- sect. 641 has no applicability.
It was not intended to reach such cases. It left them to the
revisory power of the higher courts of the State, and ultimately
to the review of this court. We do not say that Congress cofild
not have authorized the removal of such a case into the Federal
courts at any stage of its proceeding, whenever a ruling should
be made in it denying the equal protection of the laws to the
defendant. Upon that subject it is unnecessary to affirm any
thing. It is sufficient to say now that sect. 641 does not.
It is evident, therefore, that the denial or inability to enforcle in the judicial tribunals of a State, rights secured to a
defendant by any law providing for the equal civil rights of all
persons citizens of the United States, of which sect. 641 speaks,
is primarily, if not exclusively, a denial of such rights, or an
inability to enforce them, resulting from the Constitution or
laws of the State, rather than a denial first made manifest at
the trial of the case. In other words, the statute has reference

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

[Sup. Ct.

to a legislative denial or an inability resulting from it. Many
such cases of denial might have been apprehended, and some
existed. Colored men might have been, as they had been,
denied a trial by jury. They might have been excluded by
law from any jury summbned to try persons of their race, or
the law might have denied to them the testimony of colored
men in their favor, or process for summoning witnesses. Numerous other illustrations might be given. In all such cases a
defendant can affirm, on oath, before trial, that he is denied
the eqi1al protection of the laws or equality of civil rights.
But in the absence of constitutional or legislative impediments
he cannot swear before his case comes to trial that his enjoyment of all his civil rights is denied to him. When he has
only an apprehension that such rights will be withheld' from
him when his case shall come to trial, he cannot affirm that
they are actually denied, or that he cannot enforce them. Yet
such an affirmation is essential to his right to remove his case.
By the express requirement of the statute his petition must set
forth the facts upon which he bases his claim to have his case
removed, and not merely his belief that he cant enforce his
rights-at a subsequent stage of the proceedings. The statute
was not, therefore, intended as a corrective of errors or wrongs
committed by judicial tribunals in the administration of the
law at the trial.
The petition of the two colored men for the removal of their
case into the Federal court does not appear to have made any
case for removal, if we are correct in our reading of the act of
Congress. It did not assert, nor is it claimed now, that the
Constitution or laws of Virginia denied to them any civil right,
or stood in the way of their enforcing the equal protection of
the laws. The law made no discrimination against them
because of their color, nor any discrimination at all. The complaint is that there were no colored men in the jury that indicted
them, nor in the petit jury summoned to try them. The petition expressly admitted that by the laws of the State all male
citizens twenty-one years of age and not over sixty, who are
entitled to vote and hold office under the Constitution and laws
thereof, are made liable to serve as jurors. And it affirms
(what is undoubtedly true) that this l'w 'allows the right, as

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

well as requires the duty, of the race to which the petitioners
belong to serve as jurors. It does not exclude colored citizens.
Now, conceding as we do, and as we endeavored to maintain
in the case of Strauder v. West Virginia (supra, p. 803), that
discrimination by law against the colored race, because of their
color, in the selection of jurors, is a denial of the equal protection of the laws to a negro when he is put upon trial for
an alleged criminal offence against a State, the laws of Virginia
make no such discrimination. If, as was alleged in the argument, though it does not appear in the petition or record, the
officer to whom was intrusted the selection of the persons from
whom the juries for the indictment and trial of the petitionera
were drawn, disregarding the statute of the State, confined his
selection to white persons, and refused to select any persons of'
the colored race, solely because of their color, his action was a
gross violation of the spirit of the State's laws, as well as of the
act of Congress of March 1, 1875, which prohibits and punishes
such discrimination. He made himself liable to punishment
at the instance of the State and under the laws of the United
States. In one sense, indeed, his act was the act of the State,
and was prohibited by the constitutional amendment. But
'uasmuch as it was a criminal misuse of the State law, it cannot
be said to have been such a "denial or disability to enforce in
the judicial tribunals of the State" the rights of colored men,
as is contemplated by the removal act. Sect. 641. It is to be
observed that act gives the right of removal only to a person
"who is denied, or cannot enforce, in the judicial tribuznals of
the State his equal civil rights." And this is to appear before
trial. When a statute of the State denies his right, or interposes a bar to his enforcing it, in the judicial tribunals, the presumption is fair that they will be controlled by it in their
decisions; and in such a case a defendant may affirm on oath
what is necessary for a removal. Such a case is clearly within
the provisions of sect. 641. But when a subordinate officer of
the State, in violation of State law, undertakes to deprive an
accused party of a right which the statute law accords to him,
as in the case at bar, it can hardly be said that he is denied, or
cannot enforce, "in the judicial tribunals of the State" the
rights which belong to him. In such a case it ought to be preTOL. X.

VIRGINIA v.

[Sup. Ct.

sumed the court will redress the wrong. If the accused is deprived of the right, the final and practical denial will be in the
judicial tribunal which tries the case, after the trial has commenced. If, as in this case, the subordinate officer whose duty
it is to select jurors fails to discharge that duty in the true
spirit of the law; if he excludes all colored men solely because
they are colored; or if the sheriff to whom a venire is given,
composed of both white and colored citizens, neglects to summon the colored jurors 6nly because they are colored; or if a
clerk whose duty it is to take the twelve names from the box
can with
rejects all the colored jurors for the same reason, -it
no propriety be said the defendant's right is denied by the State
and cannot be enforced in the judicial tribunals. The court
will correct the wrong, will quash the indictment or the panel,
or, if not, the error will be corrected in a superior court. We
cannot think such cases are within the provisions of sect. 641.
Denials of equal rights in the action of the judicial tribunals of
the State are left to the revisory powers of this court.
The assertions in the petition'for removal, that the giand
jury by which the petitioners were indict6d, as well as the jury
summoned to try them, were composed wholly of the white
race, and that their race had never been allowed to serve as
jurors in the county of Patrick in any case in which a colored
man was interested, fall short of showing that any civil right
was denied, or that there had been any discrimination against
the defendants because of their color or race. The facts may
have been as stated, and yet the jury which indicted them, and
the panel summoned to try them, may have been impartially
selected.
Nor did the refusal of the court and of the counsel for the
prosecution to allow a modification of the venire, by which onethird of the jury, or a portion of it, should be composed of persons of the petitioners* own race, amount to any denial of a
right secured to them by any law providing for the equal civil
rights of citizens of the United States. The privilege for which
they moved, and which they also asked from the prosecution,
was not a right given or secured to them, or to any person, by
the law of the State, or by any act of Congress, or by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. It i8 a right to which

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

every colored man is entitled, that, in the selection of jurors to
pass upon his life, liberty, or property, there shall be no exclusion of his race, and no discrimination against them because of
their color. But this is a different thing from the right which
it is asserted was denied to the petitioners by the State court,
Vlz. a right to have the jury composed in part of colored men.
A mixed jury in a particular case is not essential to'tbe equal
protection of the laws, and the right to it is not given by any
law of Virginia, or by any.Federal statute. It is not, therefore,
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, or within the purview of sect. 641.
It follows that the petition for a removal stated no facts that
brought the case -within the provisions of this section, ana,
consequently, no jurisdiction of the case was acquired by the
Circuit Court of the United States. In the absence of such
jurisdiction the writ of habeas corpits, by which the petitioners
were taken from the custody of the State authorities, should
not have been issued. The Circuit Court has now no authority
to hold them, and they should be remanded.
Upon the question whether a writ of mandamzus is a proper
proceeding to enforce the return of the men indicted to the
custody of the State authorities, little need be said, in view of
former decisions of this court. Sect. 688 of the Revised
Statutes enacts that the Supreme Court shall have power to
issue . . . writs of mandamius in cases warranted by the principles aiid usages of law, to any courts appointed under the
authority of the United States, or to persons holding office
under the authority of the United States, where a State or an
ambassador, or other public minister, or a consul or vice-consul, is a party. In what case such a writ is warranted by the
principles and usages of law it is not always easy to determine.
Its use has been very much extended in modern times, and
now it may be said to be an established remedy to oblige
inferior courts and magistrates to do .that justice which they
are in duty, and by virtue of their office, b6und to do. It does
not lie to control judicial discretion, except when that discretion has been abused; but it is a remedy when the case is
outside of the exerise. of this discretion, and outside the jurisdiction of the court or officer to which or to whom the writ is

restrain inferior courts and to keep them within their lawful

So ordered.
Separate opinion of MR.
JUSTICE CLIFFORD

JUSTICE FED,

in which MRi.

concurred.

I concur in the judgment of the court that the prisoners,
Lee and Burwell Reynolds, must be returned to the officers of
Virginia, from whose custody they were taken; that the prosecution against them must be remanded to the State eourt
from which it was removed; and that a mandamus to the
district judge of the Western District of Virginia is the appropriate remedy to effect these ends. But as I do not agree
with all the views expressed in the opinion of the court, and
there are other reasons equally cogent with those given for the
decision rendered, I deem it proper to state at length the
grounds of my concurrence.
The prisoners were jointly indicted in a county court for
the crime of murder. They are colored men, and the person
alleged to have been murdered was a white man. On being
arraigned they pleaded not guilty, and on their demand were
remanded to the Circuit Court of the county for trial. When
brought before that court, at the April Term of 1878, they
moved that the venire of jurors, then composed entirely of
persons of the white race, should be modified so as to allow
one-third of the venire to be composed of persons of their own
race. This motion was denied, on the ground that the court
had no authority to change the venire, and that it satisfactcrily
appeared that the jurors had been regularly drawn from the
jury-box according to law. The accused then presented a
petition for the removal of the prosecution to the Circuit Court

Oct . 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

of the United States for the Western District of Virginia,
setting forth the pendency of the criminal prosecution against
them, and alleging, in substance, that rights,, secured by the
law providing for the equal civil rights of all citizens of the
United States, were denied to them by the judicial tribunals
of the county, inasmuch as their application for a mixed jury
had been refused. It further alleged that a strong prejudice
existed in the community of the county against them, independent of the merits of their case, on the ground that they
were colored persons, and the one whom they were charged to
have murdered was a white man; and that from this fact alone
they were satisfied they could not obtain an impartial trial
before a jury composed exclusively of persons of the white
race.

The prayer of this petition was denied and the prisoners
were tried separately and convicted of murder, one in the first
and the other in the second degree. Both obtained new trials,
one by the action of the court of original jurisdiction, and the
other by that of the Court of Appeals on a writ of error.
At the October Term of 1878 they were a second time
brought up for trial, and before the jury were impanelled again
moved the court to remove the prosecution to the Circuit
Court of the United States, upon the petition presented at the
April Term; but the motion, as before, was denied. They
were then tried separately. In one case, the jury disagreed,
and the prisoner was remanded to jail to await another trial.
In the other case, the prisoner was convicted of murder in the
second degree, and his punishment was fixed by the jury at
eighteen years' confinement in the penitentiary.
While the prisoners were held in jail, one of them to be
again tried, and the other until he could be removed to the
penitentiary under his sentence, they procured from the clerk
of the court a copy of the record of the proceedings against
them, which they presented to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Western District of Virginia, then held by
Alexander Rives, the district judge, -with the petition for
removal presented to the-State court, and prayed that the
prosecutions should be there docketed and proceeded with.
That court granted the petition, directed the cases to be placed

VIRGINIA V. RIvES.

[Sup. Ct.

on its docket, and authorized the clerk to issue a writ of habeas
corpus cum causa to the marshal of the district, requiring him
to take the petitioners into his custody, and summon for their
trial twenty-five jurors to attend at the next term of the court.
A writ of habeas corpus cum causa was accordingly issued.
Pursuant to its command, the prisoners were removed from the
custody of the jailer and taken into the custody of the marshal.
Thereupon the Commonwealth of Virginia presented a petition
to this court praying for a writ of mandamus to be directed to
the district judge, commanding lim to order the marshal to
redeliver the prisoners to her authorities, upon the ground that
the judge in his proceedings had transcended the jurisdiction
of his court, and undertaken the exercise of powers not vested
by any law of the United States in him or the court held by.
him. Upon its presentation at the last term an order was
issued to the judge to show cause why the writ should not
issue as prayed. His return admits the facts as stated, and
justifies his action on the ground that the refusal of the State
court to set aside the venire summoned for the trial of the
prisoners, and to give them a jury composed in part of their
own race and color, was a denial to them of "the equal protec.tion of the laws," and brought their cases within the provisions
of the Revised Statutes for the removal of criminal prosecutions from the State to the Federal courts. The AttorneyGeneral of the Commonwealth contending that the return is
insufficient to justify his action, now moves that 'the writ be
issued as prayed.
The application of Virginia is resisted by a denial of the
jurisdiction of this court to issue a writ to the district judge
in the case; *a denial made not only by the counsel for the
prisoners, who has been permitted to appear in their behalf,
though the proceeding is one directly between the Commonwealth and the district judge, but by the Attorney-General,
who has appeared, though not officially, for that officer. The
ground of the denial is that the writ can be issued by this
court only in the exercise or in aid of its appellate jurisdiction,
and that the writ is here prayed in a proceeding which is not
appellate but original, because it has its commencement in the
presentation of the petition of the Commonwealth.

cVIRGINIA V. RivEs.

It is undoubtedly true that, except in cases where, under the
Constitution, this court has original jurisdiction, the writ can
be issued only in the exercise or in aid of its appellate
authority. This was held as long ago as the case of 2lfarbury
v. Madison, decided in 1803, and the doctrine has been adhered
to ever since; for the obvious reason that, the jurisdiction c!
the court being original in only a few enumerated cases, all
exercise of power in other cases must be in virtue of its appellate jurisdiction. That jurisdiction may, however, be called
into exercise in various ways. The term "appellate" in the
Constitution is not used in a restricted sense, but in the broadest sense, as embracing the power to review and correct the
proceedings of subordinate tribunals brought before it for
examination in the modes provided by law. Congress has
prescribed the mode or process by which such proceedings
shall be brought before the court. In equity cases, it is by a
simple notice that an appeal is taken from the decree or proceeding sought to be reviewed; in common-law cases, it is
generally by writ of error; in some cases it is by a writ of
prohibition, and in some by that of certiorari,or of mandamus.
The mode is one rdsting entirely in the discretion of Congress.
The Judiciary Act of 1789, passed at the first session of Congress after the adoption of the Constitution, declared that the
Supreme Court should have appellate jurisdiction from the
circuit courts and from courts of the several States in certain cases, and should "have power to issue writs of prohibition
to the district courts, when proceeding as courts of admiralty
and maritime jurisdiction, and writs of mandanus in cases
warranted by the principles and usages of law, to any courts
appointed or persons holding office under the authority of the
United States."
In Marbury v. Madison it was held that the authority given
by the act to issue the writ of mandamus to public officers was
not warranted by the Constitution, the court observing that
it was an essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction that it
ievises and corrects proceedings in a cause already instituted,
and does not create the cause; and that although the writ
might be directed to courts, yet to issue it to an officer for
the delivery of a paper was in effect the same as to sustain

"IRGINIA

V. RMVES.

tSup. Ct.

an original action for that paper; and, therefore, seemed to
belong not to appellate, but to original jurisdiction. The case
in which this language was used was an application to the
court to compel Mr. Madison, then Secretary of State, to
deliver to Mr. Marbury, as justice of the peace, a commission
which had been signed by President Adams and transmitted
to the predecessor in office of the Secretary, to be delivered to
the arpointee. There was, therefore, no action of an inferior
tribunal brought up for review, the proceeding being merely
to compel an executive officer to perform a ministerial act in
which a citizen was interested. The language must, therefore,
be limited by the facts of the case. It was not intended to
deny the authority of this court to issue the writ to public
officers, when the case.is one in which it can exercise original
jurisdiction.; and probably to avoid such an inference the addition was made to the clause we have cited which now appears
in the Revised Statutes, so as to allow the writ to issue to
public officers only "where a State or an ambassador or other
public minister or a consul or vice-consul is a party," - that is,
in cases where the court has original jurisdiction. Indeed, it
is only by such writ that the original jurisdiction of this court
can in many cases he exercised. Comrnonwealthof .Kntuckyv.
.Dennison,24 How. 66. Nor was the language intended to deny
that this court can issue the writ to judicial officers where the
object is to revise and correct their action in legal proceedings
pending in the courts held by them. Though the writ to a
subordinate or inferior court may be addressed to the court as
such, it is usually directed to the judge thereof, or, if the court
is composed of several judges, to such one or more of them as
may be authorized to hold its sessions or participate in holding
them. The reason assigned is that, in case of disobedience to
the writ, the authority to enforce it is exercised over the
judges personally who are vested with the power of exercising
the functions of the court. High, Extraordinary Legal Remedies, sect. 275. In the present case, the writ is asked against
the district judge who, whilst holding the Circuit Court of the
Western District of Virginia, made the order which is the
subject of complaint, and who, if the writ be granted, will be
able to hold that court and carry out its command. There is
no sound objection to its issue in this form.

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. IrVES.

The writ being one of the modes provided by Congress for
the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction, the question whether
it should be issued in this case is not difficult of solution if, as
contended by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Circuit
Court, in taking the prisoners from the custody of her authorities, transcended its jurisdiction. To review that action and
set aside what was done 'under it, the writ is sought. The
jurisdiction invoked is, in its nature, appellate; and there is
no other mode provided for its exercise in the case at bar
than by the writ prayed. Though the petition is the first
step taken by the Commonwealth against the judge, the proceeding is not on that account an original suit. The petition
is merely the process by which our d4pellate jurisdiction is
invoked.
It is well settled that the writ of nandamus will issue to
correct the action of subordinate or inferior courts or judicial
officers, where they have exceeded their jurisdiction, and there
is no other adequate remedy. "It issues," says Blackstone,
"to the judges of any inferior court, commanding them to do
justice according to the powers of their office, whenever the
same is delayed. For it is the peculiar business of the Court
of King's Bench to superintend all inferior tribunals, and
therein to enforce the due exercise of those judicial or ministerial powers with which the crown or the legislature have
invested them; and this not only by restraining their excesses,
but also by quickening their negligence and obviating the
denial of justice." 3 Bi. Com. 110.
It is in accordance, therefore, with the principles and usages
of law that this court should issue a mandamus in the cases
here enumerated, and thus supervise the proceedings of inferior
corrts where there is a legal right and there is no other existing legal remedy. "It is upon this ground," says Mr. Justice
Nelson, "that the remedy has been applied from an early day,
indeed, since the organization of courts and the admission of
attorneys to practise therein down to the.present time,-to
correct the abuses of the inferior courts in summary proceedings
against their officers, and especially against the attorneys and
counsellors of the courts. The order didbarring thiem, or subjecting them to fine or imprisonment, is not reviewable by writ

[Sup. Ot.

of error, it not being a judgment in the sense of the law for
which this writ will lie. Without, therefore, the use of the
writ of mandamus, however flagrant the wrong committed
against these officers, they would be destitute of any redress."
Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 864. See also -Ex parte Robinson,
19 id. 505.
And so in the case at bar, without the use of this writ the
greatest possible injury would be inflicted upon the Commonwealth of Virginia, without any redress, if the Circuit Court,
as contended, transcended its jurisdiction. In no case, therefore, could the writ be more properly issued in the interests of
justice, order, and good government. Nor was there any necessity for a previous demand upon that court, in the way of a
motion to remand the prisoners. While the authorities, says
Mr. High, in his valuable treatise on the law of mandamus, are
not altogether reconcilable as to the necessity of a previous
demand and refusal to perform the act which it is sought to
coerce, a distinction is made between the cases where the
duties to be enforced are of a public nature, affecting the public
at large, and those where the duties are of a private nature,
affecting only the rights of individuals. "And while," continues the author, "in the latter class of cases, where the person aggrieved claims the immediate and personal benefit of the
act or duty whose performance is sought, demand and refusal
are held to be necessary as a condition precedent to relief by
,mandamus; in the former class, the duty being strictly of a
public nature, not affecting individual interests, and there being
no one specially empowered to demand its performance, there is
no necessity for a literal demand and refusal. In such cases
the law itself stands in lieu of a demand, and the omission to
perform the required duty in place of a refusal." Extraordinary Legal Remedies, sect. 18.
In this case not only was the duty required of the Circuit
Court one of a public nature, in which the Commonwealth of
Virginia is interested, but it would have been a useless ceremony to move for an order remanding the prisoners to her
authorities, in the face of its direction to the marshal to take
them into custody, and its order to docket and proceed with
the prosecution against them in the Circuit Court of the United

Oct. !879.]

VIRGINIA

States, and the justification of this action contained in the
return of the judge.
The preliminary objections to the exercise of our jurisdiction being disposed of, we are brought to the important
inquiry, whether the action of the Circuit Court, in taking the
prisoners from the custody of the authorities of Virginia, was
authorized under the laws of the United States. The mandamus prayed is to. compel the return of the prisoners, as already
stated; but the validity of the order directing the marshal to
take them into his custody depends upon the legality of the
removal of the prosecution from the State to the Federal court.
The order to the marshal was the necessary sequence of assuming
jurisdiction of the prosecution. The legality of the removal is,
therefore, the question for determination. Its legality is denied by Virginia on two grounds: 1st, that the act of Congress
(Rev. Stat., sect. 641), upon the provisions of which the respondent relies, does not authorize the removal; and, 2d, that the
act, in authorizing a criminal prosecution for an offence against
a law of the State to be, before trial, removed from a State
court to a Federal court, is unconstitutional and void. In my
opinion, both of these grounds are well taken.
Sect. 641 of the Revised Statutes, re-enacting provisions of
previous statutes, in terms provides in certain cases for the
removal to the circuit courts of the United 'States of criminal
prosecutions commenced in a State court. It declares that
"when any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in
any State court, for any cause whatsoever, against any person
who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the
State, or in any part of the State where such suit or prosecution is pending, any right secured to him by any law providing
for the equal rights of citizens of the United States, or of all
persons within the jurisdiction of the United States, or against
any officer, civil or military, or other persona, for any arrest or
imprisonment or other trespass, or wrongs, made or committed
by virtue of or under color of authority derived from any law
providing for equal rights as aforesaid, or for refusing to do
any act on the ground that it 'would be inconsistent with such
law, such suit or prosecution may, upon the petition of such
defendant filed in said State court, at any time before the trial

[Sup. Ct.

or final hearing of the cause, stating the facts and verified by
oath, be removed for trial into the next circuit court to be
held in the district where it is pending. Upon the filing of
such petition all further proceedings in the State courts shall
cease." The section also provides for furnishing the Circuit
Court with copies of the process, pleadings, and proceeding
of the State court. A subsequent section provides for the
issue in such cases of a writ of habeas corpus cunt causa to
remove the accused, when in actual custody upon process of
the State court, to the custody of the marshal of the United
States.
By this enactment it appears that, in order to obtain a removal of a prosecution from a State to a Federal court, - except
where it is against a public officer or other person for certain
trespasses or conduct not material to consider in this connection, - the petition of the accused must show a denial of, or an
inability to enforce in the tribunals of the State, or of that
part of the State where the prosecution is pending, some right
secured to him by the law providing for the equal rights of
citizens or persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.
But how must the denial of a right under such a law, or the
accused's inability to enforce it in the judicial tribunals of the
State, be made to appear? So far as the accused is concerned,
the law requires him to state and verify the facts, and from
them the court will determine whether such denial or inability
exists. His naked averment of such denial or inability can
hardly be deemed sufficient; if it were so, few prosecutions
would be retained in a State court for insufficient allegations
when the accused imagined he would gain by the removal.
Texas v. Gaines, 2 Woods, 344. There muf t be such a presentation of facts as to lead the court to the conclusion that the
averments of the accused are well founded. There are many
ways in which a Person may be denied his rights, or be unable
to enforce them in the tribunals of a State. The denial or
inability may arise from direct legislation, depriving him of
their enjoyment or the means of their enforcement, or discriminating against him or the class, sect, or race to which he
belongs. And it may arise from popular prejudices, passions,
or excitement, biassing the minds of jurors-..d judges. Relig-

VIRGINIA V. RIvES.

ious animosities, political controversies, antagonisms of race,
and a multitude of other causes will always operate, in a
greater or less degree, as impediments to the full enjoyment
and enforcement of civil rights. We cannot think that the
act of Congress contemplated a denial of, or an inability to
enforce, one's rights from these latter and similar causes, and.
intended to authorize a removal of a prosecution by reason of
them from a State to a Federal court. Some of these causes
have always existed in some localities in every State, and the
remedy for them has been found in a change of the place of
trial to other localities where like impediments to impartial
action of the tribunals did not exist. The Civil Rights Act, to
which reference is made in the section in question, was only
intended to secure to the colored race the same rights and
privileges as are enjoyed by white persons : it was not designed
to relieve them from those obstacles in the enjoyment of their
rights to which all other persons are sulject, and which grow
out of popular prejudices and passions.
The -denial of rights or the inability to enforce them, to
which the section refers, is, in my opinion, such as arises from
legislative action of the State, as, for example, an act excluding
colored persons from being witnesses, making contracts, acquiring property, and the like. With respect to obstacles to the
enjoyment of rights arising from other causes, persons of the
colored race must take their chances of removing or providing
against them with the rest of-the community.
This conclusion is strengthened by the provisions of the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The original
Civil Rights Act was passed, it is true, before the adoption
of that amendment; .ut great doubt was expressed as to its
validity, and to obtain authority for similar legislation, and
thus obviate the objections which had been raised to its first
section, was one of the objects of the amendment. After its
adoption the Civil Rights Act was re-enacted, and upon the first
section of that amendment it rests. That section is directed
against the State. Its language is that "o State shall make
or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizdns of the United States; nor shall -any State
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

[Sup. Ct.

process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws." As the State, in the administration of its government, acts through its executive, legislative, and judicial departments, the inhibition applies to them.
But the executive and judicial departments only construe and
enforce the laws of the State; the inhibition, therefore, is in
effect against passing and enforcing any laws which are designed to accomplish the ends forbidden. If an executive or judicial officer exercises power with which he is not invested by law,
and does unauthorized acts, the State is not responsible for them.
The action of the judicial officer in such a case, where the rights
of a citizen under the laws of the United States are disregarded,
may be reviewed and corrected or reversed by this court: it
cannot be imputed to the State, so as to make it evidence that
she in her sovereign or legislative capacity denies the rights
invaded; or refuses to allow their enforcement. It is merely
the ordinary case of an erroneous ruling of an inferior tribunal.
Nor can the unauthorized action of an executive officer, impinging upon the rights of the citizen, be taken as evidence of her
intention or policy so as to charge upon her a denial of such
rights.
If these views are correct, no cause is shown in the petition
of the prisoners that justified a removal of the prosecutions
against them to the Federal court. No law of Virginia makes
any discrimination against persons of the colored race, or excludes them from the jury. The law respecting jurors provides
that "all male citizens, twenty-one years of age and not over
sixty, who are entitled to vote and hold office under the Constitution and laws of the State," with certain exemptions not
material to the question presented, may be jurors; and it
authorizes an annual selection in each county, by the county
judge, from the citizens at large, of from one to three hundred
persons, whose names are to be placed in a box, and from them
the jurors, grand and petit, of the county are to be drawn.
There is no restriction placed upon the county judge in selecting them, except that they shall be such as he shall think
"well qualified to serve as jurors, being persons of sound judgment and free from legal exception." The mode thus provided,
properly carried out, cannot fail to secure competent jurors.

Oct. 1879.]

VIRGINIA V. RIVES.

Certain it is that no rights of the prisoners are denied by this
legislation. The application to the State court, upon the refusal of which the petition was presented, was for a venire
composed of one-third of their race, - a proceeding wholly
inadmissible in any jury system which obtains in the several
States.
From the return of the district judge it would seem that in
his judgment the presence of persons of the colored race on the
jury is essential to secure to them the "equal protection of the
laws;" but how this conclusion is reached is not apparent,
except upon the general theory that such protection can only
be afforded to parties when persons of the class to which they
belong are allowed to sit on their juries. The correctness of
this theory is contradicted by every day's experience. Women
are not allowed to sit on juries; are they thereby denied the
equal protection of the laws? Foreigners resident in the
country are not permitted to act as jurors, yet they are protected in their rights equally with citizens. Persons over sixty
years of age in Virginia are disqualified as jurors, yet no one
-will pretend that they do not enjoy the equal protection of the
laws. If when a colored person is indicted for a criminal
offence it is essential, to secure to him the equal protection of the
laws, that persons of his race should be on the jury by which
he is tried, it would seem that the presence of such persons on
the bench should be equally essential where the court consists
of more than one judge; and that if it should consist of only
a single judge, such protection would be impossible. To such
an absurd result does the doctrine lead, which the Circuit
Court announced as controlling its action.
The equality of protection assured by the Fourteenth Amendment to all persons in the State does not imply that they shall
be allowed to participate in the administration of its laws, or
to hold any of its offices, or to discharge any duties of a public
trust. The universality of the protection intended excludes any
such inference. Were this not so, aliens resident in the country,
or temporarily here, of whom there are many thousands in
each State, would be without that equal protection which the
amendment declares that no State shall deny to 'any person
within its jurisdiction.

VIRGNIA V. RIVEs.

[Sup. Ct.

It follows from these views as to the meaning and purpose
of the act of Congress that the removal of the prosecution in
this case from the State to the Federal court is unauthorized
by it; and that the order of the Circuit Court to the marshal
to take the prisoners from the custody of the State authorities
is illegal and void.
The second objection of the Commonwealth to the legality
of the removal is equally conclusive. The prosecution is for
the crime of murder, committed within her limits, by persons
and at a place subject to.her jurisdiction. The offence charged
is against her authority and laws, and she alone has the right
to inquire into its commission, and to punish the offender.
Murder is not an offence against the United States, except
when committed on an American vessel on the high seas, or in
some port or haven without the jurisdiction of the State, or
in the District of Columbia, or in the Territories, or at other
places where the national government has exclusive jurisdiction. The offence within the limits of a State, except where
jurisdiction has been ceded to the United States, is as much
beyond the jurisdiction of these courts as though it had been
committed on another continent. The prosecution of the
offence in such a case does not, therefore, arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and the act of Congress
which attempts to give the Federal courts jurisdiction of it is,
to my mind, a clear infraction of the Constitution. That
instrument defines and limits the judicial power of the United
States.
It declares, among other things, that the judicial power shall
extend to cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States, and to various
controversies to which a State is a party; but it does not
include in its enumeration controversies between a State and
its own citizens. There can be no ground, therefore, for the
assumption by a Federal court of jurisdiction of offences
against the laws of a State. The judicial power granted by
the Constitution does not cover any such case or controversy.
And whilst it is well settled that the exercise of the power
granted may be extended to new cases as they arise under the
Constitution and laws, the power itself cannot be enlarged by

Oct. 1879.]

O R1GINIA V. RIVES.

Congress. The Constitution creating a government of limited
powers puts a bound upon those which are judicial as well as
those which are legislative, which cannot be lawfully passed.
This view would seem to be conclusive against the validity
of the attempted removal of the prosecution in this case from
the State court. The Federal court could not in the first
instance have taken jurisdiction of the offence charged, and
summoned a grand jury to present an indictment against the
accused ; and if it could not have taken jurisdiction at first, it
cannot do so upon a removal of the prosecution to it. The
jurisdiction exercised upon the removal is original and not
appellate, as is sometimes erroneously asserted; for, as stated
by Chief Justice Marshall in .Liarbury v. Aadison, already
cited, it is of the essence of appellate jurisdiction that it revises
and corrects proceedings already had. The removal is only al.
indirect mode by which the Federal court acquires original
jurisdiction. Railway Company v. WMitton, 13 Wall. 270.
The Constitution, it is to be observed, in the distribution of
the judicial power, declares that in the cases enumerated in
which a Sthte is a party the Supreme Court shall have original
jurisdiction. Its framers seemed to have entertained great
respect for the dignity of a State which was to remain sovereign, at least in its reserved powers, notwithstanding the new
government, and therefore provided that when a State should
have occasion to seek the aid of the judicial power of the new
government, or should be brought under its subjection, that
power should be invoked only in its highest tribunal. It is
difficult to believe ihat the wise men who sat in the convention which framed the Constitution and advocated its adoption
ever contemplated the possibility of a State being required to
assert its authority over offenders against its laws in other
tribunal3 than those of its own creation, and least of all in an
inferior tribunal of the new government. I do not think I am
going too far in asserting that had it been supposed a power so
dangerous to the independence of the States, and so calculated
to humiliate and degrade them, lurked in any of the provisions
of the Constitution, that instrument would never have been
adopted.
There are many other difficulties in maintaining the position

[Sup. Ot.

of the Circuit Court, which the counsel of the accused and the
Attorney-General have earnestly defended. If a criminal
prosecution of an offender against the laws of a State can be
transferred to a Federal court, what officer is to prosecute the
case? Is the attorney of the Commonwealth to follow the
case from his county, or will the United States district attorney
take charge of it? Who is to summon the witnesses and
provide for their fees? In whose name is judgment to be
pronounced? If the accused is convicted and ordered to be
imprisoned, who is to enforce the sentence? If he is deemed
worthy of executive clemency, who is to exercise it,- the
Governor of the State, or the President of the United States ?
Can the President pardon for an offence against the State?
Can the Governor release from the judgment of a Federal
court? These and other questions which might be asked
show, as justly observed by the counsel of Virginia, the incongruity and absurdity of the attempted proceeding.
Undoubtedly, if in the progress of a criminal prosecution, as
well as in the progress of a civil action, a question arise as to
any matter under the Constitution and laws of the United
States, upon which the defendant may claim protection, or any
benefit in the case, the decision thereon may be reviewed by
the Federal judiciary, which can examine the case so far, and
so far only, as to determine the correctness of the ruling. If
the decision be erroneous in that respect, it may be reversed
and a new trial had. Provision for such revision was made in
the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and is
retained in the Revised Statutes. That great act was penned
by Oliver Ellsworth, a member of the convention which
framed the Constitution, and one of the early chief justices of
this court. It may be said to reflect the views of the founders
of the Republic as to the proper relations between the Federal
and State courts. It gives to the Federal courts the ultimate
decision of Federal questions, without infringing upon the
dignity and independence of the State courts. By it harmony
between them is secured, the rights of both Federal and State
governments maintained, and every privilege and immunity
which .the accused could assert under either can be enforced.
