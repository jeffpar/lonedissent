while payments were withheld, nor for the discount on the
certificates of indebtedness sold in the market. Such damages
are too remote. Interest, however, would have been recoverable as against a citizen, if the payments were unreasonably
delayed. But with the government the rule is different, for
in addition to the practice which has long prevailed in the
departments of not allowing interest on claims presented,
except it is in some way specially provided for, the statute
under which the Court of Claims is organized expressly declares "that no interest shall be allowed on any claim up to
the time of the rendition of judgment thereon in the Court of
Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for interest." Rev. Stat., sect. 1091. This is conclusive. No interest
was stipulated for in this contract, and the prohibition against
its allowance has not been removed in favor of the claimants.
Judgment affirmed.

FAiRFIELD v. COUNTY OF GALLATIN.
1. Where no Federal question is involved, this court will follow the construction
which has been uniformly given to the Constitution or the laws of a State
by its highest court.
2. Cases affirming this principle cited and examined.
8. This court accepts as binding the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois
in .Uicafqo S- Iuwa Railroad Co. v. Phckn~y (74 111.277) and subsequent cases,
construing the section of the Constitution of that State in force July 2, 1870,
which provides that "no county, city, town, township, or other municipality
shall ever become subscriber to the capital stock of any railroad or private corporation, or make donation to, or loan its credit in aid of, such
corporation: Provided, howerer, that the adoption of this article shall not be
construed as affecting the right of any such municipality to make such subscriptions where the same have been authorized, under existing laws, by a
vote of the people of such municipalities prior to such adoption;" and hold.
lng that such previous donations, if sanctioned by a popular vote, under
pre-existing laws, were not forbidden, but were, in like manner as subscriptions, excepted by the proviso from the general prohibitory terms of the
section.
4. Wher., therefore, pursuant to the authority conferred by a regislative enactment, such a donation was voted by a county in Illinois before the adoption of that Constitution, the donation may be thereafter completed by the
issue of the requisite bonds.

5. Chicago J- Iowa Railroad Co. v. Pinckney (supra) was decided before, but not

Bank (92 U. S. 625), involving the construction of that section, and the

as it conflicts therewith, is overruled.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Illinois.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the conrt.

Mfr. S. H. Cullom and .Mr. 0. J. Bailey for the plaintiff in
error.
.Dfr. Bluford Wilson, contra.
MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the courIt.
The facts of this case, so far as they are needed to exhibit
the question presented by the writ of error, are Very few.
The defendant, on and prior to Feb. 28, 1868, was a lawfully
organized and existing county of the State of Illinois, through
which was located the railroad of the Illinois Southeastern
Railway Company, a company incorporated on the 25th of
February, 1867. The county was authorized by the legislature
of the State to donate to the railroad company, as a bonus or
inducement towards the building of the railroad, any sum not
exceeding $100,000, and was authorized to order the .clerk of
the c6unty court, or board of supervisors of the cocaty, to
issue county bonds to the amount donated, and deliver them to
the company, provided that no donation exceeding $50,000
s~hould be made un.til after the question of such larger donation
should have been qbmitted to the legal voters of the county,
at an election called and conducted in the usual manner.
The statute further enacted, that if a majority of the ballots
cast at such in election should be in favor of. a donation, it
should be the duty of the county court or board 6f sujervisors
to donate some amount, not less than $50,000 nor more than
$100,000, to the company, and to order the issue of county
bonds for the amount so donated.
On the 28th of February, 1868, in pursuance of these statutory enactments, an election of the legal -voters of the county
was held to determine whether the county would donate

Oct. 1879.]

FAIRIELD v. COUNTY OF GALLATIN.

$100,000 of its bonds in aid of the said road, and the election
resulted in authorizing their issue. The bonds were accordingly issued by the county judge and county clerk, under the
direction of the county court, and they were delivered to the
railroad company on the 6th or 8th of October, 1870, after
the conditions precedent to their delivery had been fulfilled.
The plaintiff is the holder of coupons belonging to said issue,
having purchased them before due, in the usual course of his
business.
The defence set up is, in substance, that in consequence of
a provision in the new Constitution of the State, which came
into force July 2, 1870, the authority to issue and .deliver the
bonds had ceased to exist before the issue was made. The
section of the Constitution relied upon is in the following
words: "No county, city, town, township, or other municipality shall ever become subscriber to the capital stock of any
railroad or private corporation, or make donation to, or loan
its credit in aid of such corporation: Provided, however, that
the adoption of this article shall not be construed as affecting
the right of any such municipality to make such subscriptions, where the same have been authorized under existing
laws, by a vote of the people of such municipalities, prior to
such adoption."
The question presented, then, is whether a donation to a
railroad company, by a county empowered by the legislature
to make such a donation, when approved by a "majority of
the legal voters of the county it an election held for that
purpose, is forbidden by this clause of the Constitution, if
it was authorized under laws then existing by a vote of the
people of the county prior to the adoption of the Constitution? What should be the answer to the question depends
upon the construction that must be given to the section thus
quoted. Are donations, thus authorized by a popular vote,
within the prohibition, or are they excepted out of it by the
proviso ?
In Tu.wn of Concord v. Portsraouth Savings Ban7c (92 U. S.
625), we had occasion to construe this section of the State
Constitution. We then held that donations by counties or
other municipalities to railroad companies were prohibited by

[Sup. Ct.

it, and that they could not lawfully be made after July 2,
1870, though they had been authorized by a prior statute and
by a vote of the people of the county or municipality before
the adoption of the Constitution. We were fully aware that
it is the peculiar province of the Supreme Court of a State to
interpret its organic law, as well as its statutes, and that it is
the duty as well as the pleasure of this court to follow anil
adopt that court's interpretation. But we were not informed,
when the case was decided, that any judicial construction had
been given to the constitutional provision. It now appears that
the Supreme Court of Illinois had previously considered it, and
decided that donations, equally with subscriptions, if sanctioned
by a popular vote before the adoption of the Constitution, are
not prohibited by it, and that they are excepted from the prohibition by the proviso. This was decided by that court in
1874, more than a year before Tow of Concord v. Portsnouth
Savings Bank came before us; but the decision was not called
to our notice, and it was not reported until 1877. It may now
be found in Chicago & Iowa Railroad 0?o. v. Pinceney, 74 III.
277. The language of the court is very positive. We quote
it at some length, as follows: "At the time the section of the
Constitution referred to was framed, large sums of money in
different parts of the State had been voted by municipalities
to be subscribed and donated to railroad companies, on condition that railroads then being constructed should be completed
within a given time; and the country, whether wisely and judiciously or not, seemed to demand that in cases where the
people in these municipalities had, under then existing legislation, voted to aid railroads by subscription or donation prior to
the adoption of the Constitution, such subscription or donation
should not be affected by the formation of the Constitution.
And we have no doubt it was in view of this demand of a.
large portion of the State that the proviso was engrafted in the
foregoing section." . . . "A reasonable construction of the
whole section will embrace donations as well as subscriptions.
In one sense of the term, a donation is a subscription to the
capital stock of a company. We have no doubt, at the time
this section was framed, there were then in the State quite as
many donations voted as there were subscriptions to stock in

Oct. 1879.]

FAIRFIELD V. COUNTY OF GALLATIN.

any other manner, and if a necessity or reason existed to protect a subscription there was also the same reason and demand
to protect a donation ; and we entertain no doubt it was the
intention of the framers of the Constitution, by adding the
proviso to the section, to place subscriptions and donations on
the same footing." This authoritative exposition of the meaning of the Constitution of the State by its highest court has
repeatedly been recognized by that tribunal. Town of iJ iddleport v. The .,tna Life Insurance Co., 82 Ill. 562; Lippineott
v. l7e Town of .Pana,decided Oct. 1, 1879, not yet reported.
It has also been the understanding of the legislature of the
State that donations as well as subscriptions, if authorized by
a vote of the people before the adoption of the Constitution,
are saved by the proviso. In 1874, an act of the General
Assembly was passed which declared that the liability of all
counties, cities, townships, towns, or precincts that had voted
aid, donations, or subscriptions to the capital stock of any railroad company, in conformity with the laws of the State, should
cease and determine at the expiration of three years after July
1 of that year, and that after that time no bonds should be
issued on account of or upon authority of such vote'. This
implied that up to July, 1877, donations voted before July 2,
1870, were lawful, and might be completed by the issue of
bonds. It was an expression of the legislative understanding
that such donations were not forbidden by the Constitution.
Act of March 17, 1874. A similar act was passed on the 29th
of May, 1877, extending the time for issuing bonds for donations upon the authority of a vote of the people until July 1,
1880. It thus appears to have become a rule of property in
the State that municipal bonds, issued to railroad companieq
on account of donations voted by the people before the adoption of the Constitution, are valid, thongli not issued until
after the adoption. Such was the earliest exposition of the
Constitution, made by the court of last resort in the State,
twice since recognized by it, and recognized also by repeated
legislative action. There is every reason to believe that the
rule has been relied upon, and that on the faith of it many
municipal bonds have been issued, bought, and sold in the
markets of the country.

[Sup. Ct.

In view of all this, ought this court to adhere to the construction we gave to the State Constitution in ignorance of the
fact that the Supreme Court of" the State had previously construed it in a different manner? At a very early day it was
announced that in cases depending upon the Constitution or
statutes of a State this court would adopt the construction of
the statutes or Constitution given by the courts of the State,
when that construction could be ascertained. Polk's Lessee v.
Wendell, 9 Cranch, 87. In lNesmith v. $heldon (7 How. 812),
it is declared to be the " established doctrine that this court
will adopt and follow the decisions of the State courts in the
construction of their own Constitution and statutes, when that
construction has been settled by the decisions of its highest tribunal." In Walker v. State Harbor Commissioners
(17 Wall. 648), we said, "This court follows the adjudications
of the highest court of the State" in the construction of its
statutes. "Its interpretation is accepted as the true interpretation, whatever may be our opinion of its original soundness."
See also Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152; Green v. Y1real's
Lessee, 6 Pet. 291; Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599;
Sumner v. Hicks, id. 532; Olcott v. The Supervisors, 16 Wall.
678; State Railroad Tax Cases, 92 U. S. 575.
Such has been our general rule of decision. Undoubtedly,
some exceptions to it have been recognized. One of them is,
that when the highest court of a State has given different constructions to its Constitution and laws, at different times, and
rights have been acquired under the former construction, we
have followed that, and disregarded the latter. The present
case is -not within that exception, for there have been no conflicting interpretations by the State court of the section of the
Constitution we are now called upon to construe. And we are
not constrained to refuse following the decision of the State
court in order to save rights acquired on the faith of our ruling
in Town of Concord v. Portsmouth, Saulngs Bank. Groves v.
Slaughter (15 Pet. 449) may seem to be an exception to the
rule, but if carefully examined it will be found to be no exception. In that case, this court held that the Constitution of
Mississippi did not, ex propriovigore, prohibit the introduction
of slaves into that State as merchandise or for sale, after the

Oct. 1879.]

FAIRFIELD V. COUNTY OF GALLATIN.

first day of May, 1833, and, therefore, that a promissory note
given for the price of slaves thus introduced was not void.
This was held, though it appeared that prior to the decision
the chancellor of the State had refused to enjoin a judgment at
law recovered upon a bond for the purchase of slaves brought
into the State for sale after May 1, 1833, and the Court of
Errors, two judges against one, had affirmed the refusal of the
chancellor. But the decision of the chancellor was rested
entirely upon the ground that the matter relied upon to obtain the injunction should have been set up as a defence in
the suit at law. This was all that was really decided. The
opinions expressed in the Couit of Errors by the judges upon
the question whether the introduction of slaves after May 1,
1830, was prohibited by, the Constitution, were extra-judicial,
and were so regarded by this court. It was said they were
not sufficient to justify this court in considering that the
construction of the Constitution in Mississippi had become so
fixed and settled as to preclude the Federal Supreme Court
from regarding it as an open question. Groves y. Slaugider,
thefefore, is not an exception to the rule that this court will
follow the construction given by the highest court of a State
to its Constitution. On the contrary, the court assented to the
rule.
Subsequently, the provision of the Constitution of Mississippi
was brought before the courts of the State, and it was settled
by the highe.t tribunals that it did of itself, and without any
legislative enactment, prohibit the introduction of slaves as
merchandise, and for sale, and render all contracts for the sale
of slaves, made after May 1, 1833, illegal and void. Rowan v.
1'atmels (5 How. 134) then came up to this court, where the
same question was presented, and the construction given by
this court to the State Constitution was adhered to in order to
support a contract for slaves purchased, and apparently only
for that reason. Chief Justice Taney, in delivering the opinion
of the court, said that in Groves v. Slaughter the court was
satisfied that the validity of these sales ha4i not been brought
into question in any of the tribunals of the State until long
after the contract was made, and that as late as the beginning
of 1841, when Groves v. Slaughter was decided, it did not am-

[Sup. Ct.

pear from any thing before the court that the construction of
the clause in question had been settled either way, by judicial
decision, in the courts of the State. He added: "Undoubtedly this court will always feel itself bound to respect the
decisions of the State courts, and, from the time they are
made, will regard them as conclusive in all cases upon the
construction of their own Constitution and laws. But we
ought not to give to them a retroactive effect, and allow them
to render invalid contracts entered into with citizens of other
States, which, in the judgment of this court, were lawfully
made."
That case is totally unlike the present. The bonds in question now were issued in October, 1870. In 1874, the highest
court of the State decided that such bonds could be lawfully
issued, and that they were not forbidden by the Constitution.
It was, therefore, conclusively settled more than a year before
Town of Concord v. Portsmouth Savings Bank was decided by
us, what the meaning of the Constitution was. We are now
asked to decline following the construction given and since
recognized by the State court, and to adhere to that adopted by
us in ignorance of the prior judgment of the State court, and
that not, as in Bowan v. Runnels, to uphold contracts, but to
strike them down, though they were made in accordance with
the settled law of the State. We recognize the importance of
the rule stare decisis. We recognize also the other rule, that
this court will follow the decisions of State courts, giving a
construction to their constitutions and laws, and more especially
when those decisions have become rules of property in the
States, and when contracts must have been made, or purchases
in reliance upon them. And it has been held that this court
will abandon its former decision construing a State statute, if
the State courts have subsequently given to it a different construction. In Green v. -eal's Lessee (6 Pet. 291), the question
raised was whether the court would adhere to its own decision
in such a case, or would recede from it and follow the decisions
of the State court. In two previous cases a certain construction
had been given to a statute of Tennessee in supposed harmony
with decisions of the State court. But subsequently it was
decided otherwise by the State Supreme Court; and it appeared

Oct-. 1879.]

COWELL V. SPRINGS Co.

that the decisions upon which this court had relied were made
under peculiar circumstances, and were never in the State
considered as fully settling the construction of the act. This
court, therefore, overruled its former two decisions, and followed the later construction adopted by the State court. See
also Seydam v. Williamson, 24 How. 427. With much more
reason may we change our decision construing a State Constitution when no rights have been acquired under it, and when
it is made to appear that before the decision was made the
highest tribunal of the State had interpreted the Constitution
differently, when that interpretation within the State fixed a
rule of property, and has never been abandoned. In such
a case, we think it our duty to follow the State courts, 6nd
adopt as the true construction that which those courts have
declared.
The judgment of the Circuit Court will be reversed, and the
record remitted with instructions to give judgment for the
plaintiff below on the findings made; and it is
Sqo ordered.

COWELL v. SPRINGS COAMANY.
1. A condition in a deed conveying land thkat intoxicating liquors shall never be
manufactured, sold, or otherwise disposed of as a beverage in any place of
public resort thereon, and that if this condition be broken by the grantee,
his assigns or legal representatives, the deed shall become null and void,
and the title to the premises revert to the grantor, is not repugnant to the
c-tate granted, nor is it unlawful or against public policy.
2. Upon breach of the condition, the grantor has a right to treat the estate as
having reverted, and, under a statute of Colorado, can maintain ejectment
without a previous entry or a demand.
3. In such a suit, the grantee is estopped from denying the validity of the title
conveyed by the deed whereunder lie took possession of the land.
4. When a patent hsued by the United States adds to the name oe the patentee
the word "trustee," without mention of any trust upon which he is to hold
the land, such addition does not prevent the legal title from passing by the
patentee's conveyance. If a trust be in fact created, it is for the cestui que
trust, and no one else, to complain of the non-execution thereof.
