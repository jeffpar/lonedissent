TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

The possession obtained by the intrusion and trespass of the
plaintiff's grantors constitutes no ground for equitable relief
against the holders of the city title; and the assertion of a
possession thus obtained has as little merit as the lawless and
unjustifiable conduct of the intruders in seizing the property.
Judgment affirmed.

TENNxESSEE v. DAvis.
1. Sect. 6M. of the Revised Statutes of the United States, which declares that
"when any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in any court of
a State against any officer appointed under or acting by authority of any
revenue law of the United States now or hereafter enacted, or against
any person acting under or by authority of any such officer, on account of
any act done under color of his office or of any such law, or on account
of any right, title, or authority claimed by such officer or other person under

extends, supreme. No State can exclude it from exercising them, obstruct
its authorized officers against its will, or withhold from it, for a moment,
the cognizance of any subject which the Constitution has committed to it.
The general government must cease to exist whenever it cannot enforce the
exercise of its constitutional powers within the States by the instrumentality of its officers and agents. If, when thus acting, within the scope of
their authority, they can be arrested and brought to trial in a State court,
for an alleged offence against the law of the State, yet warranted by the
Federal authority they possess, and if the general government is powerless
to interfere at once for their protection, -if their protection must be left
to the action of the State court, - the operations of the general government
may at any time be arrested at the will of one of the States. No such
element of weakness is to be found in the Constitution.
The provision of the Constitution declaring that the judicial power of the
United States extends "to all cases in law and equity arising under the
Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made or which
shall be made under their authority," embraces alike civil and criminal
cases. Both are equally within that power.
A case arises under that Constitution not merely where a party comes into
court to demand something conferred upon him by the Constitution, a law
of the United States, or a treaty, but wherever its correct decision as to the
right, privilege, claim, protection, or defence of a party, in whole or in part
depends upon the construction of either. It is in the power of Congress to
give the circuit courts of the United States jurisdiction of such a case,
although it may involve other questions of fact or of law.
If the case, whether civil or criminal, be one to which the judicial power of
the United States extends, its removal to the Federal court does not invado
State jurisdiction. On the contrary, a denial of the right of the general
government to remove, take charge of and try any case arising under the
Constitution and laws of the United States, is a denial of its conceded
sovereignty over a subject expressly committed to'it. It is a denial of a
doctrine necessary for the preservation of the acknowledged powers of the
government. The exercise of the power to remove criminal prosecutions
is seen in the act of Feb. 4,.1815 (3 Stat. 198), again in the third section of
the act of March 2, 1833 (4 id. 633), and more recently in the act of July
13, 1866. 14 id. 171.

James M. Davis, was, in the Circuit Court for Grundy
County, in the State of Tennessee, indicted for murder. On
the twenty-ninth day of August, 1878, before the trial of the
indictment, he presented to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the proper district the following petition, praying
for a removal of the case into that court, and for a eertio.

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

"Your petitioner, James M1. Davis, would most respectfully
show to the court that on the twenty-first day of May, 1878, at
the May Term of the Circuit Court of Grundy County, Tennessee,
the grand jurors for the State of Tennessee, at the instance of
E. 31. Haynes, as prosecutor, indicted your petitioner for wilfully,
premeditatedly, deliberately, and of his malice aforethought killing
one J. B. Haynes, which indictment and criminal prosecution so
instituted is still pending against your petitioner in the Circuit
Court of Grundy County, within the middle district of Tennessee.
"And he further shows that no murder was committed; but, on
the other hand, the killing was committed in his own necessary
self-defence, to save his own life; that at the time the alleged act
for which he was indicted was committed he was, and still is, an
officer of the United States, to wit, a deputy collector of internal
revenue, and the act for which he was indicted was performed in
his own"necessary self-defence, while engaged in the discharge of
the duties of his office as deputy collector of internal revenue; and
he was acting by and under the authority of the internal-revenue
laws of the United States, and was done under and by right of his
office, to wit, as deputy collector of internal revenue. It is his
duty to seize illicit distilleries and the apparatus that is being used
for the illicit and unlawful distillation of spirits, and while so
attempting to enforce the revenue laws of the United States, as
deputy collector aforesaid, he was assaulted and fired upon by a
number of armed men, and in defence of his life returned the fire.
In view of these facts, your petitioner prays that said cause may
ne removed from the Circuit Court of Grundy County to the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Middle District of Tennessee for trial, and that a certiorariissue. And as in duty bound
he will ever pray.

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Or.

-The record having been returned, in compliance with the
writ, a motion was made to remand the case to the State court;
and, on the hearing of the motion, the judges were divided
in opinion upon the following questions, which are:certified
here :
First, Whether an indictment of a revenue officer (of the
United States) for murder, found in a State court, under t'ie
facts alleged in the petition for removal in this case, is removable to the Circuit Court of the United States, under sect. 643
of the Revised Statutes.
Second, Whether, if removable from the State court, there is
any mode and manner of procedure in the trial prescribed by
the act of Congress.
Third, Whether, if not, a trial of the guilt or innocence of
the defendant can be had in the United States Circuit Court.
Mr. Benjamin J. Lea, Attorney-General of Tennessee, and
11r. James G. Field for the plaintiff in error.
111r. Attorney- General -Devens and ffr. Assistant AttorneyGeneral Smith, contra.
MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.

The first of the questions certified is one of great importance,
bringing as it does into consideration the relation of the general
government to the government of the States, and bringing also
into Y-Lw not merely the construction of an act of Congress,
but its constitutionality. That in this case the defendant's
petition for removal of the cause was in the form prescribed by
the act of Congress admits of no doubt. It represented that
he had been indicted for murder in the Circuit Court of
Grundy County, and that the indictment and criminal prosecution were still pending. It represented further, that no
murder was committed, but that, on the other hand, the killing was committed in the petitioner's own necessary selfdefence, to save his own life; that at the time when the alleged
act for which he was indicted was committed he was, and still
is, an oficer of the United States, to wit, a deputy collector of
internal revenue, and that the act for which he was indicted
was performed in his own necessary self-defence while engaged
in the discharge of his duties as deputy collector; that lie was

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

acting by and under the authority of the internal-revenue laws
of the United States ; that what he did was done under and by
right of his office, to wit, as deputy collector of internal revNwas his duty t6 seize illicit distilleries and the
enue; that it,
apparitu, flat is used for the illicit and unlawful distillation of
spirikt ; and th it while so attemptihg to enforce the revenue
laws of the United States, as deputycollector as aforesaid, he
was assaulted and fired upon by a number of armed men, and
that in defence of his life he returned the fire. The petition
was verified by oath, and the certificate required by the act of
Congress to be given by the petitioner's legal counsel was
appended thereto. There is, therefore, no room for reasonable
doubt that a case was made for the removal of the indictment
into the Circuit Court of the United States, if sect. 643 of the
Revised Sta.tut,-s embraces criminal prosecutions in a State
court, and makes them removable, and if that act of Congress
was not unauthorized by the Constitution. The language of
the statute (so far as it is necessary at present to refer to it)
is as follows: " When any civil suit or criminal prosecution is
"commenced in any court of a State against any officer appointed
under, or acting by authority of, any revenue law of the United
States, now or hereafter enacted, or against any person acting
by or under authority of any such officer, on account of any
act done under color of his office or of any such law, or on
account of any right, title, or authority claimed by such officer
or other person under any such law," the case may be removed
into the Federal court. Now, certainly the petition for the
removal represented that the act for which the defendant was
indicted was done not merely under color of his office as a
revenue collector, or under color of the revenue laws, not
merely while he was engaged in performing his duties as a
revenue officer, but that it was done under and by right of his
office, and while he was resisted by an armed force in his
attempts to discharge his official duty. This is more than a
claim of right and authority under the law of the United States
for the act for which he has been indicted. It is a positive
assertion of the existence of such authority. But the act of
Congress authorizes the removal of any cause, when the acts
of the defendant complained of were done, or claimed to have

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

been done, in the discharge of his duty as a Federal officer.
It makes such a claim a basis for the assumption of Federal
jurisdiction of the case, and for retaining it, at least until the
claim proves unfounded.
That the act of Congress does provide for the removal of
criminal prosecutions for offences against the State laws, when
there arises in them the claim of the Federal right or authority,
is too plain to admit of denial. Such is its positive language,
and it is not to be argued away by presenting the supposed
incongruity of administering State criminal laws by other
courts than those established by the State. It has been strenuously urged that murder within a State is not made a crime
by any act of Congress, and that it is an offence against the
peace and dignity of the State alone. Hence it is inferred
that its trial and punishment can be cohnducted only in State
tribunals, and it is argued that the act of Congress cannot
mean what it says, but that it must intend only such prosecutions in State courts as are for offences against the United
States, - offences against the revenue laws. But there can be
no criminal prosecution initiated in any State court for that
which is merely an offence against the general government. If,
therefore, the statute is to be allowed any meaning, when it
speaks of criminal prosecutions in State courts, it must intend
those that are instituted for alleged violations of State laws, in
which defences are set up or claimed under United States laws
or authority.
We come, then, to the inquiry, most discussed during the
argument, whether sect. 643 is a constitutional exercise of the
power vested in Congress. Has the Constitution conferred
upon Congress the power to authorize the removal, from a
State court to a Federal court, of an indictment against a
revenue officer for an alleged crime against the State, and to
order its removal before trial, when it appears that a Federal
question or a claim to a Federal right is raised in the case, and
must be decided therein? A more important question can
hardly be imagined. Upon its answer may depend the possibility of the general government's preserving its own existence.
As was said in 111artin v. Hunter (1 Wheat. 863), "the general government must cease tu exist whenever it loses the

power of protecting itself if the exercise of its constitutional
powers." It can act only through its 6fficers and agents, and
they must act' -vithin the States. If, when thus acting, and
within the scope of their authority, thpse officers can be arrested
and brought to trial in a State court, for an alleged offence
ngainst the law if the State, yet warranted by the Federal
authority they possess, and if the general government is powertheir proless to interfere at once for their protection, -if
tection must be left to the action of the State court, --the
operations of the general government -may at any time be.
arrested at the will of one of its members. The legislation of
a State may be unfriendly. It may affix penalties to acts
done under the immediate direction of the national government,
and in obedience to its laws. It may deny the .authority conferred by those laws. The State court may administer not
only the laws of the State, but equally Federal law, in such a
manner as to paralyze the operations of the government. And
even if, after trial and final judgment in the State court, the
case can be brought into the United States court for review,
the officer is withdrawn from the discharge of his duty during
the pendency of the prosecution, and the exercise of acknowledged Federal power arrested.
We do not think such an element of weakness is to be found
in the Constitution. The United States is a government with
authority extending over the whole territory of the Union,
acting upon the States and upon the people of the States.
While it is limited in the number of its powers, so far as its
sovereignty extends it is supreme. No State government can
exclude it from the exercise of any authority conferred upon it
by the Constitution, obstruct its authorized officers against its
will, or withhold from it, for a moment, the cognizance of any
subject which that instrument has committed to it.
By the last clause of the eighth section of the first article of
the Constitution, Congress is invested with power to make all
laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution not only
all the powers previously specified, but also all other powers
vested by the Constitution in the government of the United
States, or in any department or officer thereof. Among these
is the judicial power of the government. That is declared by

TENNESSEE

v.

DAVIS.

[Sup. Ot.

the second section of the third article to "extend to all cases
in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of
the United States, and treaties made or which shall be made
under their authority," &c. This provision embraces alike
civil and criminal cases arising under the Constitution and
laws. Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264. Both are equally
within the domain of the judicial powers of the United States,
and there is nothing in the grant to justify an assertion that
whatever power may be exerted over a civil case may not be
exerted as fully over a criminal one. And a case arising under
the Constitution and laws of the United States may as well
arise in a criminal prosecution as in a civil suit. What constitutes a case thus arising was early defined in the case cited
from 6 Wheaton. It is not merely one where a party comes
into court to demand something conferred upon him by the
Constitution or by a law or treaty. A case consists of the
right of one party as well as the other, and may truly be said
to arise under the Constitution or a law or a treaty of the
United States whenever its correct decision depends upon
the construction of either. Cases arising under the laws of
the United States are such as grow out of the legislation of
Congress, whether they constitute the right or privilege, or
claim or protection, or defence of the party, in whole or in part,
by whom they are asserted. Story on the Constitution, sect.
1647; 6 Wheat. 379. It was said in Osborn v. The Bank of
the United States (9 Wheat. 738), "When a question to which
the judicial power of the Union is extended by the Constitution forms an ingredient of the original cause, it is in the
power of Congress to give the circuit courts jurisdiction of
that cause, although other questions of fact or of law may be
involved in it." And a case arises under the laws of the
United States, when it arises out of the implication of the law.
Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said, in the case last cited: "It is
not unusual for a legislative act to involve consequences which
are not expresged. An officer, for example, is ordered to arrest
an individual. It is not necessary, nor is it usual, to say that
he shall not be punished for obeying this order. His security
is implied in the order itself. It is no unusual thing for an act
of Congress to imply, without expressing, this very exemption

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

from State control." . . . "The collectors of the revenue, the
carriers of the mail, the mint establishment, and all those
institutions which are public in their nature, are examples in
point. It has never been doubted that all who are employed
in them are protected while in the line of their duty; and yet
this protection is not expressed in any act of Congress. It is
incidental to, and is implied in, the several acts by which those
institutions are created; and is secured to the individuals
employed in them by the judicial power alone; that is, the
judicial power is the instrument employed by the government
in administering this security."
The constitutional right of Congress to authorize the removal before trial of civil cases arising under the laws of the
United States has long since passed beyond doubt. It was
exercised almost contemporaneously with the adoption of the
Constitution, and the power has been in constant use ever
since. The Judiciary Act of Sept. 24, 1789, was passed by the
first Congress, many members of which had assisted in framing the Constitution; and though some doubts were soon after
suggested whether cases could be removed from State courts
before trial, those doubts soon disappeared. Whether removal
from a State to a Federal court is an exercise of appellate
jurisdiction, as laid down in Story's Commentaries on the Constitution, sect. 1746, or an indirect mode of exercising original
jurisdiction, as intimated in Railway Co'mpany v. Wldtton (13
Wall. 270), we need not now inquire. Be it one or the other,
it was ruled in the case last cited to be constitutional. But
if there is power in Congress to direct a removal before trial
of a civil case arising under the Constitution or laws of the
United States, and direct its removal because such a case has
arisen, it is impossible to see why the same power may not
order the removal of a criminal prosecution, when a similar
case has arisen in it. The judicial power is declared to extend
to all cases of the character described, making no distinctionbetween civil and criminal, and the reasons for conferring upon
the courts of the national government superior jurisdiction
over cases involving authority and rights under the laws of
the United States are equally applicable to both. As we have
already said, such a jurisdiction is necessary for the preserva-

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[ Su p. O t.

tion %Jthe acknowledged powers of the government. It is
essential, also, to a uniform and consistent administration of
national laws. It is required for the preservation of that
supremacy which the Constitution gives to the general government by declaring that the Constitution and laws of the United
States made in pursuance thereof, and the treaties made or
which shall be made under the authority of the United States,
shall be the supreme laws of the land, and the judges in every
State shall be bound thereby, any thing in the constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." The
founders of the Constitution could never have intended to
leave to the possibly varying decisions of the State courts what
the laws of the government it established are, what rights they
confer, and what protection shall be extended to those who
execute them. If they did, where is the supremacy over those
questions vested in the government by the Constitution? If,
whenever and wherever a case arises under the Constitution
and laws or treaties of the United States, the national government cannot take control of it, whether it be civil or criminal,
in any stage of its progress, its judicial power is, at least, temporarily silenced, instead of being at all times supreme. In
criminal as well as in civil proceedings in State courts, cases
under the Constitution and laws of the United States might
have been expected to arise, as, in fact, they do. Indeed, the
powers of the general government and the lawfulness of authority exercised or claimed under it, are quite as frequently
in question in criminal cases in State courts as they are in civil
cases, in proportion to their number.
The argument so much pressed upon us, that it is an invasion of the sovereignty of a State to withdraw from its courts
into the courts of the general government the trial of prosecutions for alleged o.ences against the criminal laws of a State,
even though the defence presents a case arising out of an act
of Congress, ignores entirely the dual character of our government. It assumes that the Siates are completely and in all
respects sovereign. But when the national government was
formed, some of the attributes of State sovereignty were partially, and others wholly, surrendered and vested in the United
States. Over the subjects thus surrendered the sovereignty

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

of the States ceased to extend. Before the adoption of the
Constitution, each State had complete and exclusive authority
to administer by its courts all the law, civil and criminal, which
existed within its borders. Its judicial power extended over
every legal question that could arise. But when the Constitution was adopted, a portion of that judicial power became
vested in the new government created, and so far as thus vested
it was withdrawn from the sovereignty of the State. Now the
execution and enforcement of the laws of the United States,
and the judicial determination of questions arising under them,
are confided to another sovereign, and to that extent the sovereignty of the State is restricted. The removal of cases arising
under those laws, from State into Federal courts, is, therefore,
no invasion of State domain. On the contrary, a denial of the
right of the general government to remove them, to take charge
of and try any case arising under the Constitution or laws of
the United States, is a denial of the conceded sovereignty of
that government over a subject expressly committed to it.
It is true, the act of 1789 authorized the removal of civil
cases only. It did not attempt to confer updn the Federal
courts all the judicial power vested in the government. Additional grants have from time to time been made. Congress
has authorized more and more fully, as occasion has required,
the removal of civil cases from State courts into the circuit
courts of the United States, and the constitutionality of such
authorization has met with general acquiescence. It has been
sustained by the decisions of this court.
Nor has the removal of civil cases alone been authorized.
On the 4th of February, 1815, an act was passed (8 Stat. 198)
providing that if any suit or prosecution should be commenced
in any State court against any collector, naval officer, surveyor,
inspector, or any other officer,, civil o" military, or any other
person aiding or assisting, agreeably to the provisions of the
act, or under color thereof, for any act done or omitted to be
done as an officer of the customs, or for any thing done by
virtue of the act or under color thereof, it might be removed
before trial into the Circuit Court of the United States, provided the act should not apply to any offences involving corporal punishment. This act expressly applied to a criminal

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

action or prosecution. It was intended to be of short duration, but it was extended by the act of March 3, 1815 (3 Stat.
p. 233, sect. 6), and re-enacted in 1817 for a period of four
years.
So, in 1833, by the act of March 2 (4 id. c. 57, sect. 3), it
was enacted that in any case where suit or prosecutir
n should
be commenced in a State court of any State against any officer
of the United States, or other person, for or on account of any
act done under the revenue laws of the United States, or under
color thereof, or for or on account of any right, authority, or
title set up or claimed by such officer, or other person, under
any such law of the United States, the suit or prosecution
might be removed, before trial, into the Federal Circuit Court
of the proper district. The history of this act is well known.
It was passed in consequence of an attempt by one of the
States of the Union to make penal the collection by United
States officers within the State of duties under the tariff laws.
It was recommended by President Jackson in a special message, and passed in the Senate by a vote of 32 to 1, and in the
House by a majority of 92. It undoubtedly embraced both
civil and criminal cases. It was so understood and intended
when it was passed. The chairman, of the Judiciary Committee which introduced the bill said: "It gives the right
to remove at any time before trial, but not after judgmhent has
been given, and thus affects in no way the dignity of the State
tribunals. TWhether in criminal or civil cases, it gives this right
of removal. Has Congress power in criminal cases? He
-would answer the question in the affirmative. Congress had
the power to give the right in criminal as well as in civil cases,
because the second section of the third article of the Constitution speaks of all cases in law and equity, and these comprehensive terms cover all. . . . It was more necessary that this
jurisdiction should be extended over criminal than over civil
cases. If it were not admitted that the Federal judiciary had
jurisdiction of criminal cases, then was nullification ratified
and sealed for ever; for a State would have nothing more to do
than to declare an act a felony or misdemeanor, to nullify all
the laws of the Union."
The provisions of the act of July 13, 1866 (14 Stat. 171,

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE v. DAVT.

sect. 67), relative to the removal of suits or prosecutions in
State courts against internal-revenue officers, provisions reenacted in sect. 643 of the Revised Statutes, are almost identical with those of the act of 1883, the only noticeable difference
being, that in the latter act the adjective "criminal" is inserted

meaning. The well-understood legal signification of the word
"prosecution" is, a criminal proceeding at the suit of the government. Thus it appears that all along our history the
legislative understanding of the Constitution has been that it
authorizes the removal from State courts to the circuit courts
of the United States, alike civil and criminal cases, arising
under the laws, the Constitution, or treaties.
The subject has more than once been before this court, and
it has been fully considered. In 13Iartin v. Hunter (1 Wheat.
304), it was admitted in argument by Messrs. Tucker and
Dexter that there might be a removal before judgment, though
it was contended there could not be after; but the contention
was overruled, and it was declared that Congress might authorize a removal either before or after judgment; that the time, the
process, and the manner must be subject to its absolute legislative control. In that case, also, it was said that the remedy of
the removal of suits would be utterly inadequate to the purposes
of the Constitution, if it could act only upon the parties, and
not upon the State courts. Judge Story, who delivered the
opinion, adding: "In respect to criminal prosecutions, the difficulty seems admitted to be insurmountable, and, in respect to
civil suits, there would in many cases be rights without corresponding remedies." . . . "In respect to criminal prosecutions
there would at once be an end of all control, and the State
decisions would be paramount to the Constitution." The expression that the difficulty in the way of the removal of criminal prosecutions seems admitted to be insurmountable has been
laid hold of here, in argument, as a declaration of the court
that criminal prosecutions cannon be removed. It is a very
shortsighted and unwarranted inference. What the court said
was, that the remedy in such cases seems to be insurmountable,
if it could not ad utpon State courts as well as parties; and it was
ruled that it does thus act. The expression must be read in its

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Oh.

connection. In Martin v. Tunter the removal was by writ of
error after final judgment in the State court; which certainly
seems more an invasion of State jurisdiction than a removal
before trial. The case was followed by Cohens v. Virginda
(6 id. 264), a criminal case, in which the defendant set up
against a criminal prosecution an authority under an act of
Congress. There it was decided that cases might be removed
in which a State was a party. This also was a writ of error
after a final judgment; but it, as well as the former case,
recognized the right of Cngress to authorize removals either
before .or after trial, and neither case made any distinction
between civil and criminal proceedings.
In The llayor v. Cooper (6 Wall. 247), the validity of the
removal acts of 1863, March 3, sect. 5 of c. 81 (12 Stat. 756),
and its amendment of May 11, 1866 (14 id. 1866), which
embraced not only civil cases but criminal prosecutions, and
authorized their removal before trial, came under consideration, and it was sustained. This court then said: The constitutional power is given in general terms. "No limitation is
imposed. The broadest language is used. ' All cases' so arising are embraced. How jurisdiction shall be acquired by the
inferior court" (of the United States), "whether it shall be
original or appellate, or-original in part and appellate in part,
and the manner of procedure in its exercise after it has been
acquired, is not prescribed. This Constitution is silent upon
these subjects. They are remitted without check or limitation
to the wisdom of the legislature." "Jurisdiction, original or
appellate, alike comprehensive in either case, may be given.
The constitutional boundary line of both is the same. Every
variety and form of appellate jurisdiction within the sphere of
the power, extending as well to the courts of the States as to
those of the nation, is permitted. There is no distinction in
this respect between civil and criminal cases. Both are within
its scope. Nor is it any objection that questions are involved
which are not at all of a Federal character. If one of the latter exist, if there be a single such ingredient in the mass, it is
sufficient." The court added, " We entertain no doubt of the
constitutionality of the jurisdiction given by the act under
which this case has arisen." See also Com. v. Ashmun,

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

3 Grant, Cas. 436; id. 416-418; State v. Yoskins (77 N. C.
530), decided in 1877, where the constitutionality of sect. 643
of the Revised Statutes was affirmed after a full and instructive
discussion.
It ought, therefore, to be considered as settled that the constitutional powers ,! Congress to authorize the removal of
criminal cases for alleged offences against State laws from
State courts to the circuit courts of the United States, when
there arises a Federal question in them, is as ample as its
power to authorize the removal of a civil case. Many of the
cases referred to, and others, set out with great force the indispensability of such a power to the enforcement of Federal
law.
It follows that the first question certified to us from the
Circuit Court of Tennessee must be answered in the affirmative.
The second qttestion is, "Whether, if the case be removable
from the State court, there is any mode and manner of procedure in the trial prescribed by the act of Congress."
Whether there is or not is totally immaterial to the inquiry
whether the case is removable; and this question can hardly
have arisen on the motion to remand the case. The imaginary
difficulties and incongruities supposed to be in the way of trying in the Circuit Court an indictment for an alleged offence
against the peace and dignity of a State, if they were real,
would be for the consideration of Congress. But they are
unreal. While it is true there is neither in sect. 643, nor in the
act of which it is a re-enactment, any mode of procedure in
the trial of a removed case prescribed, except that it is ordered
the cause when removed shall proceed as a cause originally
commenced in that court, yet the mode of trial is sufficiently
obvious. The circuit courts of the United States have all the
appliances which are needed for the trial of any criminal case.
They adopt and apply the laws of the State in civil cases, and
there is no more difficulty in administering the State's criminal
law. They are not foreign courts. The Constitution has made
them courts within the States to administer the laws of the States
in certain cases; and, so long as they keep within the jurisdiction assigned to them, their general powers are adequate to the

TENNESSEE

v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

trial of any case. The supposed anomaly of prosecuting offenders against the peace and dignity of a State, in tribunals of
the general government, grows entirely out of the division of
powers between that government and the government of a
State; that is, a division of sovereignty over certain matters.
When this is understood (and it is time it should be), it will not
appear strange that, even in cases of eriminal prosecutions for
alleged offences against a State, in which arises a defence under
United States law, the general government should take cognizance of the case and .try it in its own courts, according to its
own forms of proceeding.
The third question certified has been sufficiently answered
in what we have said respecting the second. It must be answered in the affirmative.
The first question will be answered in the affirmative, and
the second is answered as in the opinion.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD,
FIELD, dissenting.

with whom concurred MR. JUSTICE

Civil suits or criminal prosecutions, commenced in a State
court against a revenue officer of the United States, on account
of any act done under color of his office, or on account of any
right, title, or authority claimed by such officer under such
law, may, at any time before the trial or final hearing thereof,
be removed for trial into the Circuit Court next to be holden
in the district where the same is pending, in the manner prescribed in the section conferring the right. Rev. Stat., sect.
643.
Sufficient appears to show that the prisoner was formally
indicted of murder in the first degree by the grand jury of the
State, that the indictment was duly filed in the proper State
court for trial, and that it was subsequently removed into the
Circuit Court of the United States for the district, on motion
of the accused. Neither the indictment nor the order of
removal is exhibited in the transcript. Instead of that, the
statement is that the Attorney-General of the State moved
in the Circuit Court to remand the cause to the State court in
which the indictment was found. Hearing was had, and it
appears that the judges of the Circuit Court were divided in

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

opinion whether the motion of the Attorney-General ought or
ought not to be granted.
Appended to the first question certified by the judges of the
court is a paper which purports to be the petition of the prisoner under which the order of removal was granted. From
that it appears that the homicide charged is admitted, but that
the defence is that the killing by the prisoner was in selfdefence, to save his own life; that he was and still is a deputy
collector of internal revenue; and that the act for which he
is indicted, as he alleges, was performed in self-defence while
he was engaged in the performance of the duties of his office.
Speaking more specifically, he states that it is his duty to seize
illicit distilleries and the apparatus that is being used for the
illicit and unlawful distillation of spirits, and that while
attempting to enforce the revenue laws he was assaulted and
fired upon by a number of armed men, and that in defence of
his life he returned the fire.
Three questions are certified, as follows: 1. Is an indictment
in a State court for murder, under the facts set forth in the
petition for removal in this case, removable to the Circuit
Court, under sect. 643 of the Revised Statutes? 2. If removable from the State cotrt, is there any mode of procedure in
the trial prescribed by an act of Congress? 3. And if not,
can a trial of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner be had in
the Circuit Court?
Questioris-of reater importance than those certified here by
the Circuit Court could \ hardly be presented for discussion, as
they involve the necessity of an inquiry into the nature, extent,
and limitation of the judicial power both of the United States
and of the circuit courts established by Congress. Judicial
power, like other powers granted to the United States by the
Constitution, is defined by the instrument making the grant.
Governed by that rule, we find that the second section of the
third article ordains that the judicial power shall extend to
all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, the
laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be
made under their auth'ority, which provision describes the
whole extent of the judicial power of the United States conferred by the Constitution that it is necessary to examine in
VOL. X.

18

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

the present case. Other clauses in the same section enumerate
numerous other subject-matters falling within the cognizance
either of the Supreme Court or of the inferior courts created
by Congress; but it will not be necessary to examine those
clauses, as they have no bearing upon the questions to be
answered.
Pursuant to the first section of the third article, the Congress
passed the Judiciary Act, making provision for the organization
of the Supreme Court, and establishing the circuit and district
courts. I Stat. 78.
Jurisdiction of crimes and offences committed within their
respective districts, and cognizable under the authority of the
United States to a limited extent, was by that act conferred
upon the district courts; but the eleventh section of the act
provided that the circuit courts should have exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the authority
of the United States, except where the act otherwise provides,
and concurrent jurisdiction with the district courts of the
crimes and offences cognizable in those courts. id. 78.
Neither the district nor circuit courts have jurisdiction of any
crimes or offences by that act, unless the same are cognizable
under the authority of the United States. Criminal jurisdiction
is not by the Constitution conferred upon any court, and it is
settled law that Congress must in all cases make an act criminal
and define the offence before either the district or circuit courts
can take cognizance of an indictment charging the act as an
offence against the authority of the United States. Obvious
and undoubted as the proposition is, it admits of but little
illustration, and needs nothing more.
Powers expressly enumerated are granted to Congress, and
such as shall be necessary and proper for carrying the enu
merated powers into execution, or, in other words, the powers
of Congress are made up of concessions from the people of the
several States, with such implied powers as are necessary and
proper to carry the express concessions into effect, subject. to
the limitation that whatever is not expressly granted or necessarily or properly implied to carry the granted powers into
effect is reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.
Like the other powers specified, the judicial power of the

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

United States is a constituent part of those concessions from
the several States, and as was held by this court at a very
early period, it is to be exercised by the Supreme Court or
such inferior codrts as the Congress may from time to time
ordain and establish.
Of all the courts which the United States may, under their
general powers, constitute, one only -the Supreme Court possesses jurisdiction derived immediately from the Constitution, and of which the legislative power cannot deprive it.
All other courts organized by the general government possess
no jurisdiction but what is given by the power that created
them, and they can be vested with none except what the power
ceded to the United States will authorize the Congress to
confer. Certain implied powers, it is admitted, must necessarily result to courts of justice,- such as to fine for contempt
or imprison for contumacy,- but the jurisdiction of crimes
against the authority of the United States is not among such
implied powers, the universal rule in the Federal courts being
that the legislative authority of the Union must first make an
act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and prescribe what courts
have jurisdiction of such an indictment, before any Federal
tribunal can determine the guilt or innocence of the supposed
offender. United States v. ludson J Goodwin, 7 Cranch, 32;
United States v. Coolidge, 1 Wheat. 415; 1 Whart. Crim. Law
(7th ed.), sect. 163.
In accordance with that rule, it was held by the whole
court, TMarshall, C. J., delivering'the opinion, that the Circuit
Court could not take cognizance of the crime of murder committed on board of one of our ships of war lying in a harbor
within State jurisdiction, because the eighth section of the
Crimes Act, by which alone any provision had been made for
the punishment of such a crime on shipboard, only defines
offences perpetrated upon the high seas or in any river, haven,
basin, or bay out of the jurisdiction of any particular State.
United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336, 387.
It was argued in behalf of the prosecution in that case that
the jurisdiction existed because the homicide wai committed
on board a ship of war; but Mr. Webster denied the proposition, and contended that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court

TENNESSEE

v.

DAVIS.

(Sup. Ot.

was only such as had been given to it by an act of Congress,
and insisted that it was sufficient to maintain for the prisoner
that no act of Congress authorized the Circuit Court to take
cognizance of any offences merely because they were committed on ships of war. Instead of that, he insisted that it was
the nature of the place in which the ship lies and not the character of the ship itself that decides the question of jurisdiction;
and added, that if committed within the territorial jurisdiction
of the State it excluded the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court
by express exception, the language of the act only giving
authority to try and punish offenders for offences committed
upon the high seas, or in any river, haven, basin, or bay out of
the jurisdiction of any particular State.
Commenting upon that provision, the Chief Justice said, It
is not the offence, but the bay in which it is committed, which
must be out of the jurisdiction of the State, adding that, unless
the place itself be out of the jurisdiction of the State, Congress
has not given cognizance of the offence to the circuit courts.
United ,tates v. Iiltberqer,5 Wheat. 76, 96.
Apply the conclusion reached in those two cases to the
question under discussion, and it is clear that, in order to ascertain the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in criminal cases,
resort must be had to the acts of Congress providing for the
punishment of crimes; for although such courts are unquestionably to look to the common law, in the absence of statutory
provision, for rules of guidance in the exercise of their functions in criminal as well as in civil cases, it is to the acts of
Congress passed in pursuance of the Constitution alone that
they must have recourse to determine what constitutes an
offence against the authority of the United States, it being
settled law that the United States have no unwritten code to
which resort can be had as a source of jurisdiction. Conkling's
Treatise (5th ed.), 181.
Courts of the United States derive no jurisdiction in criminal
cases from the common law, nor can such tribunals take cognizance of any act of an individual as a public offence, or
declare it punishable as-such, until it has been defined as an
offence by an act of Congress passed in pursuance of the
Constitution. Argument to show that Congress has never

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

defined the act of nmurder, at a place within the exclusive
jurisdiction of a State, as an offence against the authority of
the United States, is certainly unnecessary, as no sane man
will venture to advance such a proposition; nor will any one
who ever looked into the record of this case deny that the
place where the homicide which is the subject of inquiry
was committed is in the exclusive jurisdiction of the State
whose laws were violated by the perpetrator of the felonious
act. None of these matters can be denied consistent with the
truth of the facts as judicially known to every member of the
court.
Offences against the authority of the United States, defined
by an act of Congress passed in pursuance of the Constitution,
are cognizable in the circuit courts by virtue of the eleventh
section of the Judiciary Act, whether committed upon the high
seas or in any river, haven, basin, or bay out of the jurisdiction
of any particular State, or in any fort, dockyard, arsenal, arWory, or magazine, or any other place the exclusive jurisdiction
of which is ceded to the United States. Cognizance in criminal cases may also be given to those courts, of offences against
the national authority, if properly defined by an act of Congress,
when they are committed in violation of such an act passed
pur-suant to the second section of the third article of the Constitution, which extends the judicial power to all cases in law
and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of Congress, and the treaties therein specified. 1 Whart. Cr. Law
(7th ed.), 174-180, inclusive.
Exceptional cases undoubtedly arise where it may properly
be said that the citizen owes allegiance to two sovereigns, and
may be liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of
either, where the same act is a transgression and defined offence
under the laws of both. Thus, an assault on the marshal or
hindering him in the execution of legal process is a high
offence against the United States, for which the perpetrator
is liable to punishment; and the same act may also be a
gfos breach of the peace of the State, if it results in a riot,
assault, or rou'der, and may subject the same person to tho
puii ,hentprescribed by the State laws. Mloore v. Illinois,
14 How. 13.

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

Federal sovereignty as well as the sovereignty of the States
is limited and restricted by the Constitution. Certain powers,
legislative, executive, and judicial, are possessed by each, independent of the other; and in the exercise of such powers all
agree that they act as separately and independently of each
other as if the line of division was traced by landmarks visible
to the eye. Ableman v. Booth, 21 How. 506, 516.
Both governments, though there be but one act, if the jurisdiction is dual, and the act charged is defined by the laws of
each as an offence, may subject the offender to punishment;
nor can he plead the conviction and sentence in one forum in
bar to an indictment in the other, as the act committed was an
offence against the authority of each. Fox v. The State of Ohio,
5 How. 410 ; United States v. Marigold, 9 id. 560.
Passing and uttering counterfeit coin was the charge in the
first case, and it appears that the defendant, having been convicted in the State court, removed the cause into this court,
and assigned for error that the court below had no jurisdiction
of the offence; but this court held that the State law was valid,
that offenders falling within the power of different sovereignties may be triable in each for the same act, and may properly
be subjected to the penalties which each assigns to the perpetration of the act. When carefully examined, it will be found
that the second case decides the same point in the same
way, -that the same act may in certain cases constitute an
offence against both the State and the United States, and
that it may draw to its commission the penalties denounced
by each for the commission of the act. United States v.
Amy, 14 Ald. 135, n., per Taney, C. J.; Cooley, Const. Lim.
(4th ed.) 25.
Viewed in the light of these suggestions, it seems reasonable
to conclude that Congress might define the malicious killing-of
a revenue collector with malice aforethought, while in the
performance of his official, duties, as murder, and might make
provision for the trial and punishment of the offender, even
though the homicide was committed at a place within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the State. Congress may provide for
the appointment of officers to collect the public revenue, and,
if so, they may pass constitutional laws for their protection;

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

but Congress has not defined the act charged in the State
indictment as an offence against the authority of the United
States, nor does any act of Congress prescribe'the punishment
to be inflicted for its commission, or declare what court shall
have jurisdiction of the offence.
Ample power, it was conceded, was vested in Congress to
provide for the punishment of murder committed by a person
serving on board a public ship of war, wherever the ship might
be; but inasmuch as Congress had not defined the act of killing at that place as a crime, nor affixed a punishment to it,
nor declared the court that should have jurisdiction of the
offence, this court unanimously decided, Marshall, C. J., giving
the opinion, that a murder committed on board a ship of war
lying within the harbor of Boston was not cognizable in the
Circuit Court of the District of lassachusetts, and the case
was remanded with a certificate to that effect. United States
v. Bevan , 3 Wheat. 336, 391.
Since that decision the law has been considered as settled
that the circuit courts have no jurisdiction to try and sentence
an offender, unless it appears that the offere charged is defined
by an act of Congress, and that the act dtfining the offence, or
some other act, prescribes the punishment to be imposed, and
specifies the court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.
United States v. Wltberger, 5 id. 76.
Homicide resulting from the acts of a party in opposing an
officer, employed in the enrolment of men for the military
service during the late rebellioh, was defined by an act of
Congress to be murder and punishable with death; and the
same section enacted that the conviction of the party of that
offence in the Circuil, Court should not relieve him from liability for any crime committed by him against the laws of the
State. 13 Stat., p. 8, sect. 12; United States v. Gleason,
1 Woolw. 75; Same v. Same, id. 128.
Decided cases everywhere hold that unless Congress first
defines the offence, affixes the punishment, and declares, in
some way, the court that shall have jurisdiction of the accusation, the Circuit Court can neither try the accused nor sentence
him to punishment. Even the power of Congress to define
offences and provide for the punishment of offenders is limited

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

to such subjects and circumstances as relate and are peculiar to
the Federal government. Money may be coined by that government, and therefore Congress may provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the national coin. Congress may
establish post-offices and post-roads, and therefore the Legislative Department may pass laws providing for the punishment
of persons robbing the mails; but the Congress cannot enact
laws fDr punishing persons for counterfeiting State bank issues,
or for robbing express companies established by State authority. United States v. Ward, id. 17, 20.
Offices may be created by a law of Congress, and officers to
execute the duties of the same may be appointed in the manner
specified in the Constitution ; and it is not doubted that Congress may pass laws for their protection, and for that purpose
may define the offence of killing such an officer when in the discharge of his duties. Concede that, and it follows that if the
punishment for the offence is affixed, and the jurisdiction is
given to the circuit courts, those courts may try the offender, if
legally indicted, and if duly convicted may sentence him to the
punishment which the act of Congress prescribes. Beyond all
question, the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court over such an
'indictment would be complete; but the difficulty in the way
, of the prosecutor in this case is that there is no act of Congress defining the offence charged in the indictment, nor is
there any provision in such law providing for the punishment of such an offence, or which gives the Circuit Court
or any other Federal court jurisdiction to try or sentence the
offender.
Enough appears in these observations to show that, even if
the indictment in this case had been found against a citizen of
the State for murdering the revenue officer while engaged in the
discharge of'his official daties, the Circuit Court would not,
under existing laws, have jurisdiction to try and sentence the
offender, for the reason that the offence is not defined by any
act of Congress, nor is there any act of Congress giving such
jurisdiction to the circuit courts.
Judicial authorities.to that effect are numerous and decisive;
but the principal question in this case is of a very different
character, as the indictment is against the officer of the revenue

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

for murdering a citizen of the State, having in no way any
official connection with the collection of the public revenue.
Netiher the Constitution nor the acts of Congress give a
revenue officer or any other officer 6f the United States an
immunity to commit murder in a State, or prohibit the State
forom executing its laws for the punishment of the offender.
Unquestionable jurisdiction to try and punish offenders
against the authority of the United States is conferred upon
the circuit and district courts; but the acts of Congress give
those courts no jurisdiction whatever of offences committed
against the authority of a State. Criminal homicide, committed in a State, is an offence against the authority of the State,
unless it was committed in a place within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States. Congress has never defined such
an offence when committed within the territorial limits of a
State under the circumstances described in the transcript ; nor
is ther'e any pretence for the suggestion either that the circuit
or district courts have any jurisdiction of the case, or that
there is any conflict of jurisdiction between the judicial
authorities of the State and those of th& United States.
Matters of fact are not in dispute; and it appears by the
record that the prisoner, at the time mentioned in the petition,
was duly i-idictedf of the crime of wilful murder, with malice
aforethought, by the grand jury of the county where the homicide was committed, and that the indictment is still pending in
the proper court of the State where it was filed. Adjudged
cases are not necessary to show that no Federal court created
by Congress had jurisdiction of the offence, as the homicidewas committed on land within the State, and not within any
place over which the United States had exclusive jurisdiction.
None of these matters can be successfully controverted; and,
if not, then it follows that the exclusive jurisdiction of the
offence was vested in the State court, unless it can be held
that the prisoner, merely because he was a deputy collector
of the revenue, is privileged to remove the State indictment
found by the grand jury of the State into the Circuit Court
for trial.
Nobody before ever pretended that such an offence ever was
or could be defined by an act of Congress as an offence against

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct

the Federal authority, or that the Circuit Court or any other
Federal court has or ever had any jurisdiction of such a case to
txy or sentence such an offender for such an offence. Federal
courts have no common-law jurisdiction in criminal cases, nor
can such courts proceed to try or punish any offender, except
when authorized by an act of Congress, passed in pursuance of
the Constitution. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling Bridge
Co., 13 How. 518, 563; United States v. JTorral, 2 Dall. 384,
393; Cooley, Const. Lim. (4th ed.) 26; .Ex parte Bolhizan,
4 Cranch, 75, 98.
Murder is defined by the law of the State as follows: If any
person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kill any reasonable creature, in being and under the peace of the State,
with malice aforethought, either express or implied, such person shall be guilty of murder. 3 State Stat. 43. When perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or by any other
kind of wilful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing,
or in the perpetration of or attempt to perpetrate certain other
enumerated crimes, it is murder in the first degree; and the
petition of the prisoner, in this case, shows that the charge
against him is murder in the first degree, as defined by the State
statute.
Such an offence has never been defined by an act of Congress, when committed against the authority of the State, nor
even when committed against the national authority, unless
when the killing was perpetrated on navigable waters, out of
the jurisdiction of any particular State, or in some place within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal authority.
Crimes defined by an act of Congress, and within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, may be divided into two general
classes: 1. Such as are committed on the high seas or on navigable waters out of the jurisdiction of any particular State, or
within some place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United
States. 2. Such as relate to subjects committed to the charge
of the nation, which are comprised within the grant of judicial
power over all cases aising under the Constitution, laws, and
treaties of the United States, and cases affecting ambassadors
or other public ministers and consuls.
Under existing laws the circuit courts have no jurisdiction

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE v. Dvis.

whatever to re-examine the judgments of the State courts in
any case, civil or criminal, the power to exercise such a revision
even in civil cases involving Federal questions, being vested
exclusively in the Supreme Court. Neither the Supreme Court
nor the circuit courts can re-examine the conviction, sentence,
or judgment of the District Court in a criminal case in any
form, either by writ of error or appeal. Final judgments or
decrees of a State court falling within the condition specified
in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, or the second
section of the act passed to amend the prior act upon the subject, may be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court upon a writ of error. 14 Stat. 386 ; Rev. Stat.
sect. 709.
Appellate power in criminal cases decided in the district and
circuit courts has not been vested in the Supreme Court by any
act of Congress, and of course the power of the court in respect
to such cases pending in those tribunals is confined to certificates of division of opinion. United States v. More, 3 Cranch,
159; Ex parte Hearney, 7 Wheat. 38; -Ex parte Watkins,
3 Pet. 193. Grant that, but Federal judicial power extends to
all cases in law or equity arising under the Constitution, the
laws of the United States, and treaties made or which shall be
made under their authority, and every such question may be
re-examined by writ of error in the Supreme Court under the
act of Congress passed as a substitute for the before-mentioned
section of the Judiciary Act.
Cases which involve some one or more of those questions
are often presented in the State courts; and where that occurs
and the decision is adverse to the party setting up the title,
right, or exemption, whether the suit be a civil or criminal
one, he may, when the case is determined by the highest court
of the State, sue out a writ of error and remove the cause into
the Supreme Court for re-examination. Murdoce v. Aemphs,
20 Wall. 590, 636.
Writs of error of the kind are within every day's experience;
but the rule, is universal that, if the transcript when entered
here does not present a Federal question for re-examination,
the case will be dismissed, which -shows to a demonstration
that it is only the questions which arise under the Constitution,

284

TENNESSEE

v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

the laws of the United States, and treaties made under their
authority which this court is authorized to re-examine.
Convincing support to that proposition is found in the countless cases which this court dismisses at every session for the
want of jurisdiction, the invariable rule being that, if the transcript does not exhibit some one of the questions specified in
the section to which reference has been made, the case must
be disndssed. 1 Stat. 85, sect. 25; 14 id. 386, sect. 2. Process to remove the judgment or decree from the State court to
the Supreme Court is not allowed as matter of right. Instead
of that, the practice is to submit the record of the State court
to a justice of the Supreme Court, whose duty it is to ascertain
whether, in his opinion, any question cognizable in the appellate
tribunal is involved and was decided by the proper State court
in a way to justify the allowance of the writ, and, if not, to
refuse to direct that it shall be issued.
Two other differences between the writ of error to the State
court and the common-law writ issued under the twenty-second
section of the Judiciary Act deserve to be noticed. By the
twenty-second section no case is re-examinable unless the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of a prescribed amount;
but the section granting the writ of error to the State court
makes no reference to the value involved in the controversy,
the condition being that some one of the questions specified in
the section must have been raised and decided adversely to the
applicant for the writ. They also differ in this, that the
twenty-second section confines the appellate power to final
judgments and decrees in civil cases, but the other provision,
when the proper case is presented, extends to criminal as well
as civil cases. Twitchell v. The Commonwealth, 7 Wall. 321;
Phillip's Prac. (rev. ed.) 144.
Where the matter in dispute is sufficient in value, the common-law writ of error to the Circuit Court will lie in every
case, if the judgment is final in the court to which the writ of
error is addressed; but the writ of error to the State court will
not lie at all, unless the construction of some clause of the Constitution, or some act of Congress, or treaty, is drawn in question, and the decision was adverse to the party setting up such
right or title. If those conditions concur, the writ will lie,

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

irrespective of the amount in dispute, provided it appears that
the right or title set up depends on the construction of the
Constitution, an act of Congress, or some constitutional treaty.
Williams v. Norris, 12 Wheat. 117.
Power to re-examine such cases arises under that clause of
the Constitution which provides that the judicial power of the
United States shall extend to all cases in law or equity arising
under the Constitution, the laws of the United.States, and treaties made or which shall be made under their authority. State
courts have no jurisdiction whatever of cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, or consuls, nor of cases of
admiralty and maritime cognizance. In all cases affecting
ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in
which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court, as the Constitution provides, "shall have original jurisdiction." In all
other cases mentioned in the article of the Constitution granting judicial power, the provision is that "the Supreme Court
shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with
such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress
shall make."
Early legislation of Congress gave the circuit courts original
cognizance concurrent with the several States of all suits of a
civil nature at common law or in equity, where the matter
in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs, the sum or value of
8500, and the United States are plaintiffs or petitioners, or
an alien is a party, or the suit is between a citizen of a State
where the suit is brought and a citizen of another State.
1 Stat. 78.
By the same section it is also provided to the effect, as before explained, that the circuit courts shall also hive exclusive cognizance of all crimes and offences cognizable under the
autlhority of the United States, except as therein otherwise provided.
Jurisdiction both of civil and criminal cases is, beyond
doubt, conferred upon the general government by several of
the clauses of the third article of the Constitution describing
the judicial power, entirely exclusive of that possessed by the
tribunals of the States ; but it is equally clear that none of
them, except the introductory clause of sect. 2 of that article,

TENNESSEE

v.

DAVIS.

[Sup. t

authorize any Federal court to re-examine the judgment of
a State court in a criminal case, or to supersede the power
of a State court to exercise its lawful jurisdiction in such a
case.
When the judicial system was organized under the Constitution, Congress provided, in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, that cases falling within that clause of the judicial
article of the Constitution might be reversed or affirmed upon
a writ of error, in the same manner and under the same regulations as if the judgment or decree had been rendered or
parsed in the Circuit Court. 'For eighty years that provision
remained without any alteration; and the new provision, so far
as respects the question before the court, is exactly the same
as the original enactment. 1 Stat. 85 ;-14 id. 886.
Earnest opposition was made to that provision -when it first
went into operation, and it continued to increase until it culminated in two important cases reported in the volumes containing
the decisions of the Supreme Court of that period. M1Iartin
v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 323; Cohens v. Virginia,6 id.
264, 375.
Attempt is made in argument to support the proceeding in
this case, by which the indictment was removed from the State
court into the Circuit Court, and the refusal of the Circuit
Court to remand the same by the judgment of the Supreme
Court in those two cases; but it is clear that those judgments
do not afford any justification either for the proceeding or the
refusal to remand, as both were transferred into the Supreme
Court by writ of error under the twenty-fifth section of the
Judiciary Act. Both of those cases were rightfully removed
into the Supreme Court under that section of the Judiciary
Act, as appears by the respective transcripts annexed to the
writs of error, and as appears by the countless cases since
decided by this court, and a great number, probably more than
one hundred, standing on the docket of the present term for
re-examination.
Nor is it necessary to look beyond these cases to establish
the proposition that they were re-examined under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act. Take the first case. It was
an action of ejectment brought in a subordinate State court,

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V.

DAVIS.

for the recovery of a large parcel of land situated in that part
of Virginia then called the Northern Neck. Service was
made, and the defendant, Martin, appeared and pleaded the
general issue upon the usual terms of confessing lease, entry,
and ouster. Title was claimed by the defendant under a royal
grant made prior to the Revolution, and he claimed that his
title was protected by the treaty. Leave of court being obtained, the parties agreed as to. the facts, and the subordinate
court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Prompt
appeal was taken by the defendant to the Court of Appeals, and
the appellate court reversed the judgment of the'court of original jurisdiction, and rendered judgment for the defendant.
Dissatisfied with the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the
plaintiff sued out a writ of error under the twenty-fifth section
of the Judiciary Act, and removed the cause into this court,
where the judgment of the Court of Appeals was reversed.
Pursuant to the usual course, this court sent down its mandate
to the Court of Appeals, which that court refused to execute.
No new proceedings took place, but a new writ of error waa
sued out, and the opinion of the court as reported is the one
given in the case when brought here under the second writ of
error.
Aid and comfort are attempted to be derived from certain
remarks of the court in that case, as warranting the proceedings in the case before the court; but it is clear that they cannot have any such effect, as no such question was involved in
the case, and of course the remarks of the court must be understood as applicable only to the matter then in decision.
Important Federal questions were involved in the case; and we
have the authority of the justice who delivered the opinion
for saying that the judgment drew in question and denied the
validity of a statute of the United States, as appeared on the
face of the record, and the court also held that th& principles
and rules of decision to be applied under the second writ of
error were the same as under the first, when the mandate was
sent down.
Comment upon the opinion of the court in the second case
is hardly necessary, as it does not appear to contain any thing
relating to the present theory of the government, except that

TENNESSEE

v.

DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

it proves, what everybody admits, that a writ of error under
the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act will lie, in a
proper case and when the question is properly presented, as
well in a criminal as in a civil case, irrespective of the amount
in controversy.
-Cohens was prosecuted in a State court for vending and selling lottery-tickets contrary to the statute of the State. Regular process issued and he was arrested, and the parties entered
into an agreed statement of facts. Authority was given to the
city of Washington, under an act of Congress, to permit the
drawing of lotteries for effecting certain improvements in
the city, and the defendant, besides pleading the general issue,
pleaded a justification under the act of Congress. Extended
hearing was had, and the State court rendered judgment
against the defendant, and he sued out a writ of error under
the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, and removed the
cause into this court.
Due appearance was entered for the State, and her counsel
moved to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction. Three
causes were assigned in the motion for the dismissal of the
writ of error: 1. That a State is the defendant. 2. That no
writ of error lies from this court to a State court. 3. That
the Supreme Court had no right to review the judgment of the
State court, because neither the Constitution nor any law of
the United States had been violated by the judgment of the
State court.
Extreme views were advanced on behalf of the State, among
which was the proposition that the Constitution did not provide any tribunal for its final construction, and that in the last
resort the courts of the respective States may exercise that
power. Responding to that extraordinary proposition, Marshall, 0. J., speaking for the court, said that jurisdiction is
given to the courts of the Union in two classes of cases. In
the first, their jurisdiction depends on the chtaracter of the cause,
whoever may be the parties, and comprehends "all cases in
law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the
United States, and treaties made or which shall be made under
their authority;" and, he added, that that clause extends the
jurisdiction to all the cases described, without making in it.q

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

terms any exception whatever, and without any regard to the
condition of the party.
His description of the second class is, that it comprehends
controversies between two or more States, between a State
aDd a citizen of another State, and between a State and foreign States, citizens, or subjects. Of course the second proposition of the Chief Justice must be subject to what is ordained
in the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. 2 Story,
Const., sect. 1724.
Original jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court in certain enumerated cases, and the Constitution also gives the same
tribunal appellate jurisdiction in all other specified cases.
Among those in which the jurisdiction must be exercised in
the appellate form are cases arising under the first clause of
the second section, including such as relate to the construction
of the Constitution, the acts of Congress, and treaties. If a
State is a party, the jurisdiction is original, except when the
cases arise under the first clause of the second section, in which
event the jurisdiction is appellate, as in such a case the jurisdiction can only be practically exercised in that form. Where
a State is a party, and the case is such as to admit of its originating in the Supreme Court, in the opinion of the Chief
Justice as there expressed, the case ought to originate in the
Supreme Court; but where, from the nature of the case, it
cannot originate here, he holds that the proper construction of
the clause is that the jurisdiction is appellate.
When correctly understood, it is clear that the second case
cannot have any tendency whatever to support the proposition
that an indictment for wilful and felonious murder with malice
afoethought, pending in a State court and found by a grand
jury of the State under a statute of the State, not involving
any Federal question, may be removed from the State court
into the Circuit Court for trial merely because the prisoner at
the time he committed. the homicide was a deputy collector of
the internal revenue.
Such a proposition, unsupported as it is by any respectable
judicial authority, is only calculated to excite amazement, as the
case cited is a direct and conclusive authority the other way,
showing to a demonstration that the Federal courts cannot exerVOL. X.

cise any jurisdiction whatever in a criminal case properly pending in a State court, unless it involves some question arising
under the first clause of the second section of the article describing the judicial power conferred by the Constitution. 2 Story,
Const., sects. 1721, 1740; 1 Kent, Com. (12th ed.) 299; Sergeant, Const., 59; Curtis, Com., sect. 9; Pomeroy, Const. (2d
ed.), sect. 760.
Commentators on the Constitution seem to agree that Congress enacted the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act
in order to define the classes of cases originating in State
tribunals to which the appellate power of the national courts
might extend by means of the writ of error, to preserve the
supremacy and to secure the uniform construction of the Constitution, acts of Congress, and international treaties. Curtis,
Com., sect. 210.
All agree that the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
is defined and limited by the Constitution, and that it can
neither be extended nor restricted by an act of Congress; and
it is equally undeniable that the appellate jurisdiction of that
tribunal is granted subject to such exceptions and regulations
as the Congress may make, from which it follows that appellate
jurisdiction can "only be exercised by the Supreme Court in
such cases and to such extent as the acts of Congress authorize.
Wiseart v. Dauc y, 8 Dall. 321, 827; 1 Kent, Com. (12th ed.)
824; O-larce v. Bazadone, 1 Cranch, 212.
Acts of Congress having been passed providing for the exercise of appellate judicial power, the established rule is that the
affirmative description of the cases in which the jurisdiction
may be exercised implies a negative on the exercise of such
power in all other cases. Durousseau v. TIe United State8,
6 Cranch, 307, 314; United 8tate8 v. M'ore, 3 id. 159, 170.
Legislative power is undoubtedly vested in Congress to pass
laws to define and punish offences against the authority of the
United States; but it does not follow by any means that a
prisoner charged with murder committed in violation of the
laws of a State may claim to be tried in a Federal circuit
court, or that a State indictment for such an offence constitutes
a case arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United
States, or that it can in any way become cognizable in such

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

a tribunal, certainly not unless it can be removed there in
pursuance of some act of Congress defining the offence and
providing for the trial and punishment of the offender. Persons charged with offences against the authority of the States
find ample guaranties of a fair trial in the laws of the States
and the usages of the State courts, and if the Federal officers
need more, it belongs to Congress to provide the remedy in
some mode authorized by the Constitution. 1 Kent, Com.
(12th ed.) 340.
Adjudged cases admit that the power of removal instead of
the writ of eror, as prescribed in the twenty-fifth section
of the Judiciary Act, may also be exerted when the subjectmatter of the suit is such as to bring the case within the first
clause of the second section of the article describing the
Federal judicial power. Frequent cases of the kind of a civil
nature arise, and if they could not be transferred to the circuit
courts by removal under proper regulations, it might often
happen that the object intended to be accomplished by the
appellate tribunal would be defeated. Appellate power in
the cases mentioned in the provision before referred to is given
in the Constitution, and it is left to Congress to enact the
manner of its exercise.
Curtis, Com., sect. 148 ; 31artin
v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 349.
Whether the appellate power is employed by removal or
writ of error, the right and extent of jurisdiction is the same;
ond in both the extent is limited by the constitutional grant,
and cannot be extended beyond cases in law and equity arising
under the Contitution, the acts of Congress, and such treaties
as are therein described.
Legislative provision of a restricted character for the removal
of civil causes from the State courts into the circuit courts was
made by the Judiciary Act which was passed to organize our
judicial system. 1 Stat. 79. Since that many other acts of
Congress have been passed upon the subject, by which the
power in civil cases has been very much enlarged. Proceedings were also prescribed by a later act, not now in force,
which authorized the officers appointed for the collection of
the customs to remove any suit or prosecution commenced or
pending against them in a State court, for acts done by them

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

as such officers or under color of their respective offices, into
the Circuit Court for trial; but the court is not furnished with
any evidence that any such jurisdiction was ever exercised by
the Circuit Court under that enactment in a criminal prosecution. 8 Stat. 198.
Special reference is also made to the second section in the
still later act of Congress, usually denominated the Force Bill.
4 Stat. 632. Jurisdiction of the circuit courts was by that
section extended to all cases in law and equity arising under
the revenue laws, for which other provisions are not already
made by law, and provision was made to the effect that any
revenue officer injured in his person or property, on account
of any act done by him for the protection of the revenue,
might maintain a suit for such damages in the Circuit Court
for the district where the wrong-doer resided.
Property taken or detained by a revenue officer was declared
to be irrepleviable, and that it should be deemed in the custody
of the law and subject only to the orders and decrees of the
Federal court having jurisdiction of the same. Offenders who
should dispossess or rescue, or attempt to dispossess or rescue,
any property so taken or detained were to be deemed guilty of
a misdemeanox, and punished as therein directed.
Sect. 8 of the same act empowered any such revenue officer
to remove any suit or prosecution commenced against him in
a State court, on account of any act done by him for the protection of the revenue, into the proper circuit court, for trial
in the mode therein prescribed.
Properly construed, the act, as originally passed, was intended
to furnish protection to the officers engaged in collecting
import duties, and a subsequent act provided that it should
not be so construed as to apply to cases arising under the
internal-revenue acts. Unlike that, the fiftieth section of
the act to increase duties on imports extended the provisions
of the act to cases arising under the laws for the collection of
internal duties. Had legislation stopped there, it would be
correct to say that the Force Bill is still in force; but the still
later act, passed July 13, 1866, repealed that section altogether,
subject to a proviso inapplicable to the present case. Philadelphia v. Collector, 5 Wall. 728; 13 Stat. 241; 14 id. 172;

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

Rornthallv. Collector, 9 Wall. 560, 566; Assessorm v. Osborne,
9 id. 567, 573.
Much stress in the argument was laid upon the word "prosecution," found in the third section of the act; but neither the
written nor the oral argument furnished any evidence to show
that any indictment found in the State where the difficulty
arose which induced Congress to pass the act was ever removed
from the State court into the Circuit Court for trial, and it is
well known as a historical fact that no such removal of an
indictment in that State was ever made. Civil cases pending
in the tribunals of other States were in several instances
removed under that act into the Circuit Court, and were there
adjudicated to final judgment; but there is no authentic account
that any State indictment for an offence against the authority
of a State was ever removed under that act into the Circuit
Court for trial or sentence.
Grave doubts are entertained whether the Congress, in the
use of the word "prosecution," intended to extend the operation
of the act to such an indictment, as ample provision existed at
the time of its passage for the re-examination of every question
of Federal cognizance arising on the trial of such an indictment, by a writ of error sued out pursuant to the authority
given in the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act. 1 Kent,
Com. (12th ed.) 219.
Litigations of a civil nature, even when the jurisdiction of
the Circuit Court depends entirely upon the chaiacter of the
parties, may, under regulations enacted by Congress, be removed from the State court into the Circuit Court for trial
but there is no just pretence that a State indictment for an
offence against the authority of the State can be removed from
the State court where found into the Circuit Court for trial in
any form of proceeding, unless the case, whether a suit at law
or in equity, involves some question arising under the Constitution, the laws of Congress, or treaties made, or which shall
be made, under their authority. Com. v. Casey, 12 Allen, 214,
217.
Nothing is contained in the section which has any tendency
to support the opposite construction, except the words "suit or
prosecution;" and it should not be overlooked that it employs

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

no words exclusively applicable to an indictment, and contains
many expressions utterly repugnant to the theory that the
proceedings to effect the removal of process were intended to
extend to a criminal and indictable offence.
Every word of the section speaks a different intent, is as conclusively shown by the distinguished judge who gave the opinion
of the court in the case last cited. Confirmation of that view
is also derived from the fact that every reported case, where
the removal was effected under that act, was a civil action,
as appears from the following examples: Wood v. Alatthiews,
2 Blatch. 370; Hfurray v. Patrie,3 id. 342; Fisk v. The Union
Pacific Railroad Co., 6 id. 362; s. c. .8 id. 243; Tod, Relator,
v. Panfield Com. Pleas, 15 Ohio St. 377, 387.
Formal application to the Supreme Court of Maine was
made under that act of Congress to remove an indictment for
an offence against the authority of the State into the Circuit
Court of the district for trial, but the court unanimously denied
the application, for the same reasons as those given by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in the case before cited. State
v. Elder, 54 Me. 381.
Taken together, these two cases ought to be regarded as
decisive that'a State indictment for an offence against the authority of the State could not be removed from the State court,
under that act of Congress, into the Circuit Court for trial.
Subordinate Federal courts find no other rules to guide them in
he exercise of their functions than are to be found in the acts
of Congress, and they can have no other recourse than to those
enactments to determine what constitutes an offence against
the authority of the United States. Conkling's Treatise (5th
ed.) 181. Offences against the nation. are defined and their
punishment prescribed by acts of Congress. Cooley, Const.
Lim. (4th ed.) 26.
Like power was given to the defendant, by the act relating
to h abeas corpus, for the removal into the circuit courts, after
judgment of suits or prosecutions commenced in a State court
against officers, civil or military, for acts done or committed by
virtue of an order of the President, or pursuant to an act of
Congress. 12 Stat. 756.
Pending an action in a State court against a marshal, in

which the verdict and judgment were in favor of the plaintiff,
the defendant instituted proceedings in the State court for the
removal of the cause into the Circuit Court, but the State cdurt
refused to send up the case. Thereupon the Circuit Court
issued an alternative mandamus to the State court, which was
followed by the peremptory process, when the plaintiff sued
out a writ of error, and removed the cause into this court.
Due hearing was bad here, and this court unanimously held
that so much of the act as provided for the removal of a
judgment in a State court, in which the issue was tried by
a jury, is not in pursuance of the Constitution, and is void.
TUe Justices v. Murray, 9 Wall. 274; McKee v. Bains, 10 id.
22, 25.
Governed by that rule of decision, it must be considered that
the power of removal, -when the facts have been found by a
jury, cannot be exercised in such a case after judgment.
Statutory power to remove an action from a State court into
the circuit, says Judge Story, if it exists before judgment
because it is included in the appellate power, must exist after
judgment for the same reason, as he held that the same objection exists as to the removal before judgment as after, and that
both must stand or fall together. Martin v. Hunter's Lessee,
1 Wheat. 804, 849; 2 Story, Const., sect. 1745.
None of the advocates of the power of removal as applied to
criminal cases pretend that it may be exercised after judgment in any other mode' than by a writ of error; from which it
would seem to follow, if the authorities cited are good law, that
a State indictment for an offence against the authority of the
State cannot be removed at all into the Circuit Court for trial,
nor into the Supreme Court, except by writ of error.
Sect. 643 of the Revised Statutes, under which the removal
in this case was made, is a revision of the sixty-seventh section
of the act to reduce internal taxation. 14 Stat. 171. Officers
appointed under that act may, before trial, in any case, civil or
criminal, where suit or prosecution is commenced against them
in a State court, remove the said suit or prosecution into the
Circuit Court for trial. Rev. Stat. 648.
Further remarks in exposition of. the enactment seem to be
unnecessary, as it is clear that it is in all esseitial respects the

296

TENNESSEE

v.

[Sup. Ct.

same as its predecessors, some of which were passed and went
into operation even before the actual close of the second war of
Independence.
Considering the long period the provision has been in operation, it would naturally be expected, if it was intended by its
framers to include State indictments pending in State courts
for bffences against the authority of the State, that the advocates of such a construction would be able to produce some
authoritative exposition of the enactment to support such an
improbable and extraordinary theory. Nothing of the kind is
produced, and for the best possible reason, that no removal of
such an indictment from a State court into the Circuit Court
for trial was ever before made in our judicial history.
Should it be suggested that a recent case, cited in the brief
for the prisoner, is a precedent where a criminal case was
removed fromh a State court into the Circuit Court for trial,
the answer to the suggestion is, that the case does not support
the proposition, for several reasons: 1. Because the order of
removal was never carried into effect. 2. Because nothing was
done in the Circuit Court except to pass the order for removal.
3. Because the opinion of the court as reported admits that the
circuit courts have no power to try offences against the peace
and dignity of the State, nor to control the State courts in any
such case. 4. Because the court admit in that case that no
man charged with an offence against the authority of the State
can defend himself by the fact that he is a Federal officer.
5. Because it does not appear that the State indictment was
ever transferred into the Circuit Court for trial. 6. Because
it appears that the court giving the opinion in that case entirely overlooked the settled rule that the circuit courts have
no jurisdiction of any act of an individual as an offence, unless
the same is defined as such by an act of Congress, nor unless
some act of Congress prescribes the punishment annexed to the
commission of the offence, and designates the court to try and
sentence the offender. 7. Because the indictment, for- aught
that appears to the contrary, is still pending in the State
court, the report failing to show that it has ever been in fact
transferred into the Circuit Court. State v. Hoskins, 77 N. 0.
530, 546.

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

Viewed in, any light, the proposition to remove a State
indictment for felony, from a State court having jurisdiction
of the case, into the Circuit Court, where it is substantially
admitted that the prisoner cannot be tried until Congress shall
enact some mode of procedure, approaches so near to what
seems to me both absurd and ridiculous, that I fear I shall
never be able to comprehend the practical wisdom which it
doubtless contains. Were the object to give felons an immunity to commit crime, and to provide a way for their escape
from punishment, it seems to me that it would be difficult to
devise any mode more effectual to that end than the theory
embodied in that proposition.
Difficulties almost without number would arise if any
attempt should be made to try such an indictment in a circuit court.
It was suggested at the argument that the attorney-general
of the State might appear in the Circuit Court as the public
prosecutor, but he may not deem it any part of his duty to
conduct criminal prosecutions in any other tribunals than those
of the State from which he received his commission. Public
prosecutions against the authority of the United States are
in the circuit courts within the exclusive direction of the
district attorneys, but they have nothing to do with prosecutions against the statutes, peace, and dignity of a State.
Coi fcation Cases, 7 Wall. 452.
Service of process is often required in a criminal case, and
the question would arise whether it should be made by the
sheriff or marshal. Subpcenas must be issued, and the inquiry
would arise whether they should be issued in the name of the
State or of the President. Expenses must be incurred for the
service of process and for the travel and attendance* of witnesses, and it would at once become a question whether the
amount would be chargeable to the United States or to the
State, and if to the latter, may the State be compelled to
respond to the claim.
Persons indicted of murder and other high crimes are entitled
to a copy of the indictment and 'process to compel the attendance of witnesses, and the inquiry arises whether it would be
the duty of the Circuit Court clerk or the clerk of the State

TENNESSEE v. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

court to comply with that constitutional requirement. Under
the State law the prisoner, if the charge is of felony punishable with death, is entitled to thirty-five" challenges, whereas
under the act of Congress he is entitled only to twenty; and
the inquiry would immediately arise, whether the right of the
prisoner in that regard must be governed by the act of Con
gress or the State law. 2 State Stat., sect. 4014 ; Rev. Stat.,
sect. 819.
By the common law it was error, for which the judgment
might be reversed, if the clerk did not in capital felonies inquire
of the prisoner before sentence whether he had any thing to say
why judgment of death should not be, pronounced against him;
and the question would arise whether this inquiry should be
made by the clerk of the State court whose laws were offended
by his crime, or by the clerk of the Circuit Court to which
the indictment had been transferred. 1 Chitty, Cr. Law, 700,
717.
Juries in the Federal courts are not the judges of the law
as well as the fact, consequently they are usually sworn in
capital cases that they will well and truly try and true deliverance make of the prisoner they have in charge, according
to the law and the evidence. Where such is the practice the
question will arise whether the law referred to is Federal or
State law, or both combined, including the common law, as
is suggested for the other rules of 'decision in conducting the
trial.
State rules of evidence or of procedure, adopted since the
passage of the act of Congress organizing the Federal courts,
do not apply in criminal cases where the indictment is found
in the circuit courts; and the question may immediately arise,
which system of evidence and of procedure will furnish the rule
of decision where the indictment is found in the State court
and the prisoner is tried in the Circuit Court. United States
v. Reid, 12 How. 861, 365.
It was in view of these and many other equally embarrassing
questions which might be suggested that induced Judge Story
to remark, in one of his leading jddgments upon the subject,
that in respect to criminal prosecutions the difficulty seems
admitted to be insurmountable, which is fully equivalent to a

Oct. 1879.]

TENNESSEE

v.

DAVIS.

declaration that the power of removal in such a case does not
exist. .Martinv. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 849.
Ingenious effort was made in the argument at the bar to
show that such was not the meaning of the learned justice when
he gave utterance to that important qualification to his antecedent remarks in the same connection; but the effort is in vain,
as the same learned magistrate made the same admission in his
valuable Commentaries on the Constitution, published nearly
twenty years later. 2 Story, Const. (3d ed.), sect. 1746.
Whether conclusive or not, it must be conceded that great
weight is due to those admissions, and they are also much
strengthened by a similar admission in the commentaries of
another learned writer upon constitutional law. Curtis, Com.,
sect. 15.
Embarrassing questions, it is admitted, may arise in the
exercise of such a peculiar and hitherto unknown jurisdiction;
but the attempt is made to furnish a panacea for them all by
referring to sect. 722 of the Revised Statutes, which seems to
contemplate that where the laws of the United States are insufficient to define offences and punish 6ffenders, resort may be
had to the common law as modified and changed by the State
wherein the Federal court exercising jurisdiction is held, both
in the trial of the accused and in the infliction of punishment.
Examined in the most favorable light, the provision is a mere
jumble of Federal law, common law, and State law, consisting
of incongruous and irreconcilable regulations, which in legal
effect amounts to no more than a direction to a judge sitting
in such a criminal trial to conduct the same as well as he can,
in view of the three systems of criminal jurisprudence, without
any suggestion whatever as to what he shall do in such an
extraordinary emergency if he should meet a question not regulated by any one of the three systems.
Unless some better remedy than what is contained in that
section can be found it seems to me that.it would be better to
close the discussion without suggesting any, as it is plain that
there is nothing in that enactment which will enable the judge
sitting in such a criminal trial to solve any considerable number
of the embarrassing questions, which it may well be expected.
will arise in the trial of such a criminal case.

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

State police in its widest sense comprehends the whole system of internal regulation by which the State seeks not only to
preserve the public order and to prevent offences against her
authority, but also to establish for the intercourse of one citizen with another those rules of justice, morality, and good conduct which are calculated to prevent a conflict of interests and
to insure to every one the uninterrupted enjoyment of his own,
as far as is reasonably consistent with a like enjoyment of
equal rights by others. Public police is in effect defined by
the great commentator of the common law as the due regulation of domestic order, whereby the citizens of a State are
bound to conform" to the rules of propriety and good conduct,
and to be moral, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective
-stations. 4 Bl. Com. 162.
Police, says Bentham, is a system of precaution, either for
the prevention of crimes or calamities; and he divides the
subject into many heads, of which three only will be mentioned: 1. Police for the prevention of offences. 2. Police
for the prevention of calamities. 3. Police for the prevention
of endemic diseases. Bentham's Works, title Offences against
Police, vol. iii. p. 169, Edinburgh ed.
Unlike the conceded right to appropriate private property
when the public exigency requires it, the power in question is
one, says Shaw, C. J., vested in the legislature to make, ordain,
and establish all manner of wlioltsome and reasonable laws,
statutes, and ordinances, either with penalties or without, not
repugnant to the Constitution, as they shall judge to be for
the good and welfare of the State and of the subjects of the
same. Commonwealth v. Alger, 7 Cush. 53, 85.
It extends, says another eminent judge, to the protection of
the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons and
of all property within the State, as exemplified in the maxim,
Sic utere tuo ut alienum non icedas. Thorpe v. B. J B. B.
Co., 27 Vt. 140, 147.
Ordinary regulations of police, says Cooley, have been left
with the States, nor can it be taken from them and exercised
under legislation by Congress. Nor can the national government through any of its departments or officers assume any
supervision of the police regulations of the States. All that

odt. 1679.]

TkN'sEs,-v. DA vS.

the Federal authority- can do is to see -that the States do not
under cover of this power, invade the sphere of national sove
reignty, obstruct or impede the exercise of any authority which
the Constitution has confided to the nation, or -deprive any
citizen of rights guaranteed by .the Federal Jjonstitaution.
Cooley, Const. Lim (4th ed.) 715.
No direct general power over these objects, says Marshall,
C. J., is granted to Congress, and consequently they -remain
subject to State legislation. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 203.
Within State limits, says Chase, 0, J., an act of Congress
upon the subject can have no constitutional operation. United
States v. .Dewitt, 9 Wall. 41-45.
Acts of Congress cannot properly supersede the police powers
of the State, nor can the police powers of the State override the
national authority, as the power of the State in that regard
extends only to a just regulation of rights with a view to the
due protection and enjoyment of all; and if the police law of
the State does not deprive any one of that which is justly and
properly his own, it is obvious that its possession by the State
and its exercise for the regulation of the actions of the citizens
can never constitute an invasion of national jurisdiction or
afford a basis for an appeal to the protection of the national
authorities.
Startling propositions -are advanced in argument; but it is
not probable that any one will contend that it would be competent for Congress to define as murder against the authority
of the United States the homicide charged in the petition for
removal, or that such act of homicide is now defined as murder
by any act of Congress now in operation or which was ever
passed by the Legislative Department since the Constitution
was adopted.
Had the officer been killed, the proposition of removal would
be less astonishing than the one set forth in the petition.
Judging from the petition, the indictment is against the officer
for wilfully, premeditatedly, and deliberately killing and murdering the deceased, against the peace and dignity of the State.
No special ground is set forth for the removal nor any thing
that can be tortured into a reason for withdrawing the case
from the jurisdiction of the State court, unless it be that the

TENNESSEE V. DAVIS.

[Sup. Ct.

prisoner is a deputy collector of the revenue, and that he
alleges in the peti,ion that the killing was in his own necessary
self-defence to save his own life, which is a defence that can
as well be made in the State court as in the Circuit Court.
unless it be assumed that a Federal officer is entitled as a
matter of right to transfer every indictment against him foi
crime, when found in a State court, into a Federal court for
trial.
Persons accused of capital or otherwise infamous crimes
must be indicted by a grand jury, and when the offence is
committed in a State, they must be tried in the State where
it was committed; .but attention is not called to any article
or section of the Constitution that forbids that a Federal officer shall be tried in a State court for murder committed in
the open State, against the peace and dignity of the State,
and contrary to the form of the State statute defining the
offence.
Large concessions were made by the States to the United
States, but they never ceded to the national government their
police powers or the power to define and punish offences
against their authority, as admitted by all courts and all commentators upon the Constitution, which leads me to the following conclusions: 1. That the section of the Revised Statutes
in question does not authorize the removal of a State indictment for an offence against the laws of the State from the
State court where it is pending into the Circuit Court of the
United States for trial. 2. That if it does purport to confer
that authority, it is unconstitutional and void. 3. That the
answer to each of the three questions certified here from the
Circuit Court should bein the negative.
