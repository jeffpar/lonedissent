NAGLE V. RUTLEDGE.

NAGLE V. RUTLEDGE.
This court has no jurisdiction to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of
the Territory of Wyoming, unless the record shows that the matter actually
in dispute exceeds $1,000.

MOTION to dismiss a writ of error to the Supreme Court of
the Territory of Wyoming.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

3]Ir. .Edward P. Johnson for the defendant in error, in support of the motion.

Ir. W. .B. Steele, contra.
AIR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
To give us jurisdiction in cases coming from the Supreme
Court of the Territory of Wyoming, the value of the matter
in dispute must exceed $1,000. This writ of error was sued
out by the defendant below on a judgment against him for
only $969.63. It is claimed we have jurisdiction, however,
because the defendant in his answer set up a counter claim
for $1,340. The only question presented here on that branch
of the case is whether the plaintiff below was liable for interest on a note of $210, at the rate of three per cent a month
from the twenty-fourth day of June, 1872, until the date of
the judgment, July 26, 1876, or for some shorter period.' In
no event could the amount thus put in controversy reach
$1,000; and since if error should b'e found in the charge of
the court on this claim, it would only result in a reduction of
the judgment as it now stands, and not in an actual money
recovery in favor of the defendant below, it follows that our
jurisdiction is not shown by the record, and that the suit must
be dismissed.

So ordered.
