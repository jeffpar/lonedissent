[Sup. Ct.

Dow v. JOHNSOw.
1. On the trial of an action at law, when the judges of the Circuit Court are op
posed in opinion on a mdterial question of law, the opinion bf the presiding
judge prevails; but the judgibent rendered conformably thereto may, without regard to its amount, be reviewed on a writ of error, upon'their certifi.
cate stating such question.
2. An officer of the army of the United States, whilst serving in the enemy's
couptry during the rebellion, was not liable to an action in the courts of
that country for injuries resulting from his military orders or acts; nor
could he be required by a civil tribunal to justify or explain them upo any
allegation of the injured party that they were not justified by military necessity. He was subject to the laws of war, and amenable only to his own
government.
3. When any portion of the insurgent States was in the occupation of the forces
of the United States during the rebellion, the municipal laws, if not suspended
or superseded, were generally administered there by the ordinary tribunals
for the protection and benefit of persons not in the military service. Their
continued enforcement was not for the protection or the control of ofacers
or soldiers of the army.
4. A district court of Louisiana - continued in existence after the military
occupation of the State by the United States, and authorized by the commanding general to hear causes between parties -summoned a brigadiergeneral of the army of the United States to answer a petition filed therein,
setting forth that a military comp ny had, pursuant to 'his orders, seized
and carried off certain personal property of the plaintiff, who alleged that
the seizure was unauthorized by the necessities of war, or martial law,
or by. the superiors of that officer. Judgment by default was rendered
April 9, 1863, against him for the value of the property. When sued in the
Circuit Court of the United States, upon the judgment, he pleaded that
the property was taken to supply the army. Held, on demurrer to the
plea, that the State court had no jurisdiction of the cause of action, and
that the judgment was void.

stationed in Louisiana in command of Forts Jackson and St.
Philip, on the Mississippi River, below New Orleans. These
forts surrendered to the forces of the United States in April,
1862. The fleet under Admiral Farragut had passed them and
reached New Orleans on the 25th of the month, and soon after'wards the city was occupied by the forces of the United States
under General Butler. On taking possession of the city, the
General issued a proclamation, bearing date on the 1st of May,
1862, in which, among other things, he declared that until the
restoration of the authority of the United States the city would
be governed by martial law; that all disorders, disturbances of
the peace, and crimes of an aggravated nature, interfering with
the forces or laws of the United States, would "be referred to
a military court for trial .and punishment; " that other misdemeanors would be subject to the municipal authority, if it
desired to act; and that civil causes between parties would "be
referred to the ordinary tribunals." Under this proclamation,
the Sixth District Court of the City and Parish of New Orleans
-was allowed to continue in existence, the judge having taken
the oath of allegiance to the United States..
In January, 1863, General Dow was sued in that court by
Bradish Johnson, the plaintiff in this case. The petition,
-which is the designation given in the system of procedure in
Louisiana to the first pleading in a civil action, set forth that
the plaintiff was a citizen of New York, and for several years
had been the owner of a plantation and slaves in Louisiana,
on the Mississippi River, about forty-three miles from New
Orleans; that on the 6th of September, 1862, during his temporary absence, the steamer "Avery," in charge of Captain
Snell, of Company B of the Thirteenth Maine Regiment, with
a force under his command, had stopped at the plantation, and
taken from it twenty-five hogsheads of sugar; and that said
force had plundered the dwelling-house of the plantation and
carried off a silver pitcher, half a dozen silver knives, and other
table ware, the private property of the plaintiff, the whole
property taken amounting in value to $1,611.29; that these
acts of Captain Snell and of the officers and soldiers under his
command, which the petition characterized as "illegal, wanton, oppressive, and unjustifiable," were perpetrated under a

Dow V.JOHNSON.

[Sup. CtL

verbal and secret order of Brigadier-General Neal Dow, then in
the service of the United States, and in command of Forts
Jackson and St. Philip, who, by his secret orders, which the
petition declared were " unauthorized by his superiors, or by
any provision of martial law, or by any requirements of necessity growing out of a state of war," wantonly abused his power,
and inflicted upon the plaintiff the wrongs of which he complained ; and therefore he prayed judgment against the General
for the value of the property.
To this suit General Dow, though personally served with
citation, made no appearance. He may have thought that during the existence of the war, in a district where insurrection
had recently been suppressed, and was only kept from breaking out again by the presence of the armed forces of the United
States, be was not called upon by any rule of law to answer to
a civil tribunal for his military orders, and satisfy it that they
were authorized by his superiors, or by the necessities growing
out of a state of war. He may have supposed that for his military conduct he was responsible only to his military superiors
and the government whose officer he was.
Be that as it may, or whatever other reason he may have
had, he made no response to the petition; he was therefore
defaulted.
The Sixth District Court of the Parish of New
Orleans did not seem to consider that it was at all inconsistent
with his duty as an officer in the army of the United States
to leave his post at the forts, which guarded the passage of the
Mississippi, nearly a hundred miles distant, and attend upon
its summons to justify his military orders, or seek counsel and
procure evidence for his defence. Nor does it appear to have
occurred to the court that, if its jurisdiction over him was recognized, there might spring up such a multitude of suits as to keep
the officers of the army stationed in' its district so busy ithat
they would have little time to look after the enemy and guard
against his attacks. The default of the General being entered,
testimony was received showing that the articles mentioned
were seized by a military detachment sent by him and removed
from the plantation, and that their value amounted to $1,454.81.
Judgment was thereupon entered in favor of the plaintiff for
that sum, with interest and costs. It bears date April 9, 1863.

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v. JOHNSON.

Upon this judgment the present action was brought in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Maine.
The declaration states the recovery of the judgment mentioned,
and makes profert of an authenticated copy. To it the defendant pleaded the general issue, nul tiel record, and three special
pleas. The object of the special pleas is to show that the District Court had no jurisdiction to render the judgment in question, for the reason that at the time its district was a part
of the country in insurrection against the government of the
United States, and making war against it, and was only held
in subjection by its armed forces. It is not important to state
at length the averments of each of these pleas. It will be sufficient to state the material parts of the second plea and a single
averment of the third. The second plea, in substance, sets up
that as early as February, 1861, the State of Louisiana adopted
an ordinance of secession, by which she attempted to withdraw
from the Union and establish an independent government; that
from that time until after April 9, 1863, the date of the judgment in question, she was in rebellion against the government
of the United States, making war against its authority; that
in consequence the military forces of the United States engaged in suppressing the rebellion took forcible possession of
that portion of the State comprising the district of the Sixth
District Court of New Orleans, and held military occupation
of it until long after April 9, 1863, during which time maitial
law was established there and enforced; that the defendant was
then a brigadier-general in the military service of the United
States, duly commissioned by the President, and acting in that
State under his orders and the articles of war; that by the
general order of the President of July 22, 1862, military commanders within the States of Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas
were directed, in an orderly manner, to seize and use any property, real or personal, which might be necessary or convenient
for their several commands as supplies, or for other military
purposes ; that the defendant, in the performance of his duty
as a brigadier-general, was in command of troops of the United
States in Louisiana; and that the troops by his order seized
from the plaintiff, then a citizen of that State, certain chattels
VoL. X.

Dow v. JoHNso.[

[Sup. Ct.

necessary and convenient for supplies for the army of the
United States, and other military purposes; and that for that
seizure the action was brought in the Sixth District Court of
New Orleans against him, in which the judgment in question
was rendered; but that the District Court had no jurisdiction
of the action or over the defendant at its commencement, or at
the rendition of the judgment.
The third plea also avers that, for the purpose of suppressing
the rebellion and restoring the national authority, the government of the United States, through its proper officers, declared
and maintained martial law in Louisiana, from May 1, 1862,
until long after the 9th of April, 1863, and deprived all the
courts in that State, including the Sixth District Court of New
Orleans, of all jurisdiction, except such as should be conferred
on them by authority of the officer commanding the forces of
the United States in that State, and that no jurisdiction over
persons in the military service of the United States, for acts
performed in the line of their duty, was by such authority conferred upon that court.
To the first plea, that of nul tiel record, the plaintiff replied
that there was such a record, of which he prayed inspection;
and the record being produced, the court found in his favor.
To the special pleas the plaintiff replied that the District Court
had lawful jurisdiction over parties and causes of action within
i ts district at the time and place mentioned, and to render the
judgment in question. To the replication the defendant demurred; and upon the demurrer two questions arose, upon
which the judges in the Circuit Court were opposed in opinion,
namely: 1st, whether the replication is a good and sufficient
reply to the special pleas; and, 2d, whether the Sixth District
Court, at the time and place mentioned, had jurisdiction of the
parties and cause of action, to render the judgment in question.
By statute, when the judges of the Circuit Court are opposed
in opinion upon any question arising on the trial of a cause,
the opinion of the presiding justice prevails, and judgment is
entered in conformity with it. Here the presiding justice was
of opinion that the replication was a sufficient reply to the special pleas, and that the District Court had jurisdiction over the
parties and the cause, and to render the judgment in question.

Oct. 1879.]

Dow V. JOHNSON.

Accordingly, the plaintiff had final judgment upon the demurrer, which was entered for $2,659.67 and costs; and the
defendant has brought the cause here by writ of error on a
certificate of division of opinion.
The important question thus presented for our determination
is, whether an officer of the army of the United States is liable
to a civil action in the local tribunals for injuries resulting from
acts ordered by him in his military character, whilst in the
service of the United States, in the enemy's country, upon an
allegation of the injured party that the acts were not justified
by the necessities of war.
But before proceeding to its consideration there is a preliminary question of jurisdiction to be disposed of. The act of
Feb. 16, 1875, "to facilitate the disposition of cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, and for other purposes,"
provided, that whenever by the laws then in force it was required that the matter in dispute should exceed the sum or
value of $2,000, exclusive of costs, in order that the judgments
and decrees of the circuit courts of the United States might
be re-examined in the Supreme Court, such judgments and
decrees thereafter rendered should not be re-examined in the
Supreme Court, unless the matter in dispute should exceed the
sum or value of $5,000, exclusive of costs. 18 Stat. 315. It
is therefore contended that a judgment cannot-be reviewed by
this court, upon a certificate of division of opinion between the
judges of the Circuit Court, if the judgment be under $5,000;
and the judgment in the present case is under that amount.
We do not think, however, that this conclusion is warranted by
the language of the act in question. That act makes no change
in the previous laws, except as to amounts necessary to give
the court jurisdiction, when the amount is material. Where
before $2,000 was the sum required for that purpose, afterwards
$5,000 was the sum. But before that act questions arising in
the progress of a trial could be brought to this court for determination upon a certificate of division of opinion, without
reference to the amount in controversy in the case. The original act of 1802, allowing this mode of procedure, was always
held to extend our appellate jurisdiction to material questions
of law arising in all cases, criminal as well as civil, without

164

Dow v. JoHNsoN.

[Sup. Ct.

regard to the amount in controversy or the condition of the
litigation. Its defect consisted in the delays it created by frequently suspending proceedings in the midst of a trial. To
obviate this defect the first section of the act of June, 1872,
was passed, requiring the case to proceed notwithstanding the
division, the opinion of the presiding justice to prevail for the
time being; and this feature is retained in the Revised Statutes. Sects. 650, 652, 693. The benefit of the certificate can
now be had after judgment upon a writ of error or appeal.
That is the only material change from the original law. We
have no doubt, therefore, of our jurisdiction in this case.
This brings us to the consideration of the main question involved, which we do not regard as at all difficult of solution,
when reference is had to the character of the late war. That
war, though not between independent nations, but between
different portions of the same nation, was accompanied by the
general incidents of an international war. It was waged between people occupying different territories, separated from
each other by well-defined lines. It attained proportions seldoin reached in the wars of modern nations. Armies of greater
magnitude and more formidable in their equipments than any
known in the present century were put into the field by the
contending parties. The insurgent States united in an organization known as the Confederate States, by which they acted
through a central authority guiding their military movements;
and to them belligerent rights were accorded by the Federal
government. This was shown in the treatment of captives as
prisoners of war, the exchange of prisoners, the release of
officers on parole, and in numerous arrangements to mitigate as
far as possible the inevitable suffering and miseries attending
the conflict. The people of the loyal States on the one hand,
and the people of the Confederate States on the other, thus
became enemies to each other, and were liable to be dealt with
as such without reference to their individual opinions or dispositions. Commercial intercourse and correspondence between
them were prohibited, as well by express enactments of Congress
as by the accepted doctrines of public law. The enforcement of
contracts previously made between them was suspended, partnerships were dissolved, and the courts of each belligerent were

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v. JOHNSON.

closed to the citizens of the other, and its territory was to the
other enemy's country. When, therefore, our armies marched
into the country which acknowledged the authority of the Confederate government, that is, into the enemy's country, their
officers and soldiers were not subject to its laws, nor amenable
to its tribunals for their acts. They were subject only to their
own government, and only by its laws, administered by its authority, could they be called to account. As was observed in
the recent case of Coleman v. Tennessee, it is well settled that a
foreign army, permitted to march through a friendly country,
or to be stationed in it by authority of its sovereign or government, is exismpt from its civil and criminal jurisdiction. The
law was so stated in the celebrated case of Die Exchange, reported in the 7th of Cranch. Much more must this exemption
prevail where a hostile army invades an enemy's country.
There would be something singularly absurd in permitting an
officer or soldier of an invading army to be tried by his enemy,
whose country it had invaded. The same reasons for his exemption from criminal prosecution apply to civil proceedings.
There would be as much incongruity, and as little likelihood of
freedom from the irritations of the war, in civil as in criminal
proceedings prosecuted during its continuance. In both instances, from the very nature of war, the tribunals of the enemy
must be without jurisdiction to sit in judgment upon the military conduct of the officers and soldiers of the invading army.
It is difficult to reason upon a proposition so manifest; its
correctness is evident upon its bare announcement, and no additional force can be given to it by any amount of statement as
to the proper conduct of war. It is manifest that if officers or
soldiers of the army could be required to leave their posts and
troops, upon the summons of every local tribunal, on pain of a
judgment by default against them, which at the termination of
hostilities could be enforced by suit in their own States, the
efficiency of the army as a hostile force would be utterly destroyed. Nor can it make any difference with what denunciatory epithets the complaining party may characterize their
conduct. If such epithets could confer jurisdiction, they would
always be supplied in every variety of form. An inhabitant of
a bombarded city would have little hesitation in declaring the

Dow

V. JOHNSON.

[Sup. t

bombardment unnecessary and cruel. Would it be pretended
that he could call the commanding general, who ordered it,
before a local tribunal to show its necessity or be mulcted
in damages? The owner of supplies seized or property destroyed would have no difficulty, as human nature is constituted, in believing and affirming that the seizure and destruction
were wanton and needless. All this is too plain for discussion,
and will be readily admitted.
Nor is the position of the invading belligerent affected, or his
relation to the local tribunals changed, by his temporary occupation and domination of any portion of the enemy's country.
As a necessary consequence of such occupation and domination,
the political relations of its people to their former government
are, for the time, severed. But for their protection and benefit,
and the protection and benefit of others not in the military
service, or, in other words, in order that .the ordinary pursuits
and business of society may not be unnecessarily deranged, the
municipal laws -that is, such as affect private rights of persons
and property, and provide for the punishment of crime -are
generally allowed to continue in force, and to be administered
by the ordinary tribunals as they were administered before the
occupation. They are considered as continuing, unless suspended or superseded by the occupying belligerent. But their
continued enforcement is not for the protection or control of
the army, or its officers or soldiers. These remain subject to
the laws of war, and are responsible for their conduct only to
their own government, and the tribunals by which those laws
are administered. If guilty of wanton cruelty to persons, or of
unnecessary spoliation of property, or of other acts not authorized by the laws of war, they may be tried and punished by the
military tribunals. They are amenable to no other tribunal,
except that of public opinion, which, it is to be hoped, will
always brand with infamy all who authorize or sanction acts of
cruelty and oppression.
If, now, we apply the views thus expressed to the case at
bar, there will be no difficulty in disposing of it. The condition of New Orleans and of the district connected with it, at
the time of the seizure of the property of the plaintiff and the
entry of the judgment against Dow, was not that of a country

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v.

JOHNSON.

restored to its nominal relations to the Union, by the fact that
they had been captured by our forces, and were held in subjection. A feeling of intense hostility against the government of
the Union prevailed, as before, with the people, which was ready
to break out into insurrection upon the appearance of the enemy
in force, or upon the withdrawal of our troops. The country
was under martial law; and its armed occupation gave no jurisdiction to the civil tribunals over the officers and soldiers of the
occupying army. They were not to be harassed and mulcted
at the complaint of any person aggrieved by their action. The
jurisdiction which the District Court was authorized to exercise over civil causes between parties, by the proclamation of
General Butler, did not extend to cases against them. The
third special plea alleges that the court was deprived by the
general government of all jurisdiction except such as was conferred by the commanding general, and that no jurisdiction
over persons in the military.service for acts performed in the
line of their duty was ever thus conferred upon it. It was not
for their control in any way, or the settlement of complaints
against them, that the court was allowed to continue in existence. It was, as already stated, for the protection and benefit
of the inhabitants of the conquered country and others there
not engaged in the military service.
If private property there was taken by an officer or a soldier
of the occupying army, acting in his military character, when,
by the laws of war, or the proclamation of 'the. commanding
general, it should have been exempt from seizure, the owner
could have complained to that comihander, who might have
ordered restitution, or sent the offending party before a military tribunal, as circumstances might have required, or he
could have had recourse to the government for redress. But
there could be no doubt of the right of the army to appropriate any property there, although belonging to private individuals, which was necessary for its support or convenient for its
use. This was a belligerent right, which was not extinguished
by the occupation of the country, although the necessity for its
exercise was thereby lessened. However exempt from seizure
on other grounds private property there may have been, it was
always subject to be appropriated, when required by the neces-

Dow v.

JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ct.

sities or convenience of the army, though the owner of property taken in such case may have had a just claim against the
government for indemnity.
The case of BElphinstone v. Bedreechund is an authority, if
any were needed, that a municipal court has no jurisdiction to
adjudge upon the validity of a hostile seizure of property; that
is, a seizure made in the exercise of a belligerent right. There
it appeared that a city of India had been captured by the
British forces, and a provisional government established, which
subsequently held undisturbed possession of the place. Several
months after its occupation, the members of the provisional
government seized the private property of a native, under the
belief that it was public property intrusted to his care by the
hostile sovereign. The native had been refused the benefit of
the articles of capitulation of a fortress, of -which he was governor, but had been permitted to reside under military surveillance in his own house in the city, where the seizure was made.
At the time, there were no hostilities in the immediate neighborhood, and the civil courts were sitting for the administration
of justice; but the war was not at an end throughout thf
country, and there was a feeling of great hostility on th'e part
of the people of the place, which was only prevented from
breaking out into insurrection by the presence of an armed
force. In these respects the position of the place was similar
to that of New Orleans, and the adjacent country under the
command of General Butler. The property seized consisted of
gold coin, jewels, and shawls; and the owner having died, an
action for their value was brought by his executor against the
members of the provisional government who ordered the seizure,
and judgment was rendered against them in the Supreme Court
of Bombay. That court appeared to be controlled in its decision by the fact that for some months before the seizure the
city had been in the undisturbed possession of the provisional
government, and that civil courts, under its authority, were
sitting there for the administration of justice. But on appeal
to the Privy Council the judgment was reversed. "We think,"
said Lord Tenterden, speaking for the Council, "the proper
character of the transaction was that of a hostile seizure made,
if not flagrante, yet nondum cessante bello, regard being had

Oct;. 1879.]

both to the time, the place, and the person; and, consequently,
that the Municipal Court had no jurisdiction to adjudge upon
the subject, but that, if any thing was done amiss, recourse
could only be had to the government for redress." 1 Kn. 861.
Here, the special pleas allege that the articles of 'property taken
by the military detachment under General Dow were seized by
his order, as necessary and convenient supplies for the occupying army. It was a hostile seizure, as much so as that of the
property in the case cited, being made, like that one, in the
exercise of a belligerent right, upon the propriety or necessity
of which the Municipal Court had no authority to adjudge.
This doctrine of non-liability to the tribunals of the invaded
country for acts of warfare is as applicable to members of the
Confederate army, when in Pennsylvania, as to members of
the National army when in the insurgent States. The officers
or soldiers of neither army could be called to account civilly or
criminally in those tribunals for such acts, whether those acts
resulted in the destruction of property or the destruction of
life; nor could they be required by those tribunals to explain
or justify their conduct upon any averment of the injured party
th't the acts complained of were unauthorized by the necessities of war. It follows that, in our judgment, the District
Court of New Orleans was without jurisdiction to render the
judgment in question, and the special pleas in this case constituted a perfect answer to the declaration. See Coleman v.
Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509; Ford v. Surget, id. 594; also LeCauz v. Eden, 2 Doug. 594; Lamar v. Browne, 92 U. S. 187;
and Coolidge v. Guthrie, 2 Amer. Law REg. Nq. s. 22.
We fully agree with the presiding justice of the Circuit
Court in the doctrine that the military should always be kept
in subjection to the laws of the country to which it belongs,
and that he is no friend to the Republic who advocates the
contrary. The established principle of every free people is,
that the law shall alone govern; and to it the military must
always yield. We do not controvert the doctrine of llitclell
v. Harmony, reported in the 18th of Howard; on the contrary, we approve it. But it has no application to the case at
bar. The trading for which the seizure was there made had
been permitted by the Executive Department of our govern-

[Sup. Ct.

ment. The question here is, What is the law which governs
an army invading an enemy's country? It is not the civil law
of the invaded country; it is not the civil law of the conquering country: it is military law, - the law of war, - and its
supremacy for the protection of the officers and soldiers of the
army, when in service in the field in the enemy's country, is as
essential to the efficiency of the army as the supremacy of the
civil law at home, and, in time of peace, is essential to the preservation of liberty.
Our decision upon the questions certified to us is, that the
replication is not a good and sufficient reply to the special
pleas; and that the Sixth District Court of New Orleans, at
the time and place mentioned, had not jurisdiction of the
parties and cause of action to render the judgment in question.
The judgment of the Circuit Court must, therefore, be reversed,
and the cause remanded with directions to that court to enter
final judgment for the defendant on the demurrer to the replications ; and it is
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE SwAYNE dissented from the opinion of the
court on the point relating to the jurisdiction of this court, but
concurred therewith on the remaining questions involved in
the case.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFORD and MR. JUSTICE MILLER disuented.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD. Officers and soldiers in the military service are not amenable, in time of -war, to process from
the civil tribunals for any act done in the performance of their
duties; but if the injurious act done to person or property was
wholly outside of the duty of the actor, and was wilfully and
wantonly inflicted, for the mere purpose of oppression or private gain, the party by whom or by whose orders it was committed may be answerable in the ordinary courts of justice,
except when the civil tribunals are silenced by the exigencies of
military rule or martial law. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 46.

DOW v. JOHNSON.

or of immediate and impending public danger, may be impressed into the public service, or may be seized and appropriated to the public use, or may even be destroyed without the
consent of the owner and without antecedent compensation.
Extreme cases of the kind may doubtless arise, as where the
propqrty taken is imperatively necessary in time of war to construct defences for the preservation of a military post at the
moment of an impending attack by the enemy, or to supplr
food or clothing to a suffering or famishing army destitute of
such necessaries and without other means of such supplies.
Such emergencies in the public service have and may hereafter occur in time of war, and in such cases no doubt is entertained that the power of the government is ample to supply for
the moment the public wants in that way to the extent of the
immediate public exigency; but the public danger must be
imminent and impending, and the emergency in the public
service must be extreme and imperative and such as will not
admit of delay or a resort to any other source of supply.
Exigencies of the kind do arise in time of war or impending
public danger; but it is the emergency only that gives the right,
and it is clear that the emergency must be shown to exist
before the taking can be justified. United States v. .ussell,
13 Wall. 623.
Public convenience authorizes the exercise of the right of
eminent domain, subject to the condition that due provision is
made for compensation ; and public necessity, in time of war or
impending public danger, may authorize the taking of private
property without any such provision, to supply for the moment
the public wants, to the extent of the public exigency, which cannot be supplied in any other way. 2 Kent, Com. (12th ed.) 338.
Nothing but the emergency will warrant the taking; and it is
settled law in this court that the officer who makes the seizure
cannot justify his trespass merely by showing the orders of his
superior, the rule being that an order to commit a trespass can
afford no justification to the person by whom it is executed.
Alitekell v. Harmony, 13 How. 115.
Support to all the principles before enunciated is found in
the very able opinion of the court, given by Chief Justice
Taney, in which he fully admits that private property may be

172

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ct.

taken by a military commander to prevent it from falling into
the hands of the enemy, and that it may also be taken, in ce-tain extreme cases, for public use without just compensation.
Reasonable doubt upon that subject cannot be entertained;
but lie proceeds to show, what is equally plain, that it cannot
be done in the first case unless it appears that the danger was
immediate and impending, nor in the second, unless it appeared
that the necessity and urgency were such as would not admit
of delay. Farmerv. Lewis, 1 Bush, 66.
Where a trader during war is engaged in tr'ading with a portion of the enemy country that has been reduced to subjection,
and his trading there is permitted and encouraged by the invading army, his goods cannot be seized on the ground that he
is engaged in an unlawful trade with the enemy. In such a
case, the officer seizing the property becomes liable for the
abuse of his authority, and the owner of the goods is entitled
to recover in trespass for the damage suffered. Harmony v.
Mitchell, 1 Blatch. 548.
Judgment was rendered, April 9, 1863, against the defendant in the Sixth District Court of New Orleans, in an action
of trespass for the unlawful taking and conversion of the goods
and chattels of the plaintiff described in the schedule annexed
to the writ. Payment of the judgment being refused, the
plaintiff brought an action of debt on the same against the
defendant in the Circuit Court for the Maine District, where
the defendant resides. Service was made, and the defendant
appeared and pleaded nul tiel record and three special pleas, as
follows: 1. That the court which rendered the judgment had
no jurisdiction of the case, for the reason that the military
forces of the United States, prior to the rendition of the judgment, took forcible possession of New Orleans, and held such
military possession of the locality. 2. That the said court had
no jurisdiction of th: case, for the reason that he, as a military
commander, seized the goods and chattels mentioned as supplies for the army. 3. That the said court had no jurisdiction
of the case, for. the reason that be was a military officer, and
that in taking the goods and chattels he acted in obedience to
the orders of his superior officers.
These pleas, containing as they did new special matters, prop.

erly concluded with a verification, which made it necessary for
the replication, if in the general form as now allowed, to tender
an issue to the country. Instead of adding the similiter,the
defendant filed a general demurrer to the replication; and the
objection now is, that the replication is defective in form, it
being too general to amount to a traverse of the new matters
set forth in the special pleas.
Two answers to that may be given: 1. That the form accords with that given by the most approved text-writers upon
the subject. Stephen, Plead. (9th Am. ed.) 60; 1 Chitty,
Plead. (16th ed.) 606. 2. That the demurrer should have been
special, in order to avail the defendant. 1 Chitty, Plead. (16th
ed.) 694; Stephen, Plead. (9th ed.) 40.
Heoring was had, and the court, both judges concurring,
found in favor of the plaintiff, that there is such a record as
that set forth aid described in the declaration.
Two questions also arose under the demurrer of the defendant to the replication of the plaintiff filed to the three special
pleas. Those questions are as follows: 1. Whether the replication is a good and sufficient reply to the three special pleas of
the defendant. 2. Whether said Sixth District Court at the
time and place aforesaid had jurisdiction of the parties and the
cause of action alleged in the declaration.
Certificates of division of opinion between the judges of the
Circuit Court under a former act gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction of the questions certified, but the universal rule was that
the Supreme Court would only consider the single question or
questions certified. Ogle v. Lee, 2 Cranch, 33.
Nothing could come before the court under such certificate
except the single question or questions certified here by the
circuit judges, in respect to which they were divided in opinion. Ward v. CT amberlain, 2 Black, 430-434; Rev. Stat., sect.
652.
Juriodiction acquired in that mode of proceeding was limited
to the points certified, and could not be extended by a certificate of division to any thing except what would be open to revision here under a writ of error or appeal. -Davis v. Braden,
10 Pet. 286; Packer v. Nixon, id. 408; Tayman v. Southard,
10 Wheat. 1 66.

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ct.

Both of those questions were certified at the time and were
duly entered of record; and the act of Congress provides that
whenever such a difference occurs, the opinion of the presiding
justice shall prevail and be considered the opinion of the court
for the time being. Pursuant to that statutory regulation, the
presiding justice proceeded to state that he was of the opinion: 1. That the replication of the plaintiff is a good and sufficient reply to the three special pleas pleaded by the defendant.
2. That the said Sixth District Court of New Orleans did, at the
time and place aforesaid, have jurisdiction of the parties and the
cause of action to render the judgment set forth and described
in the declaration.
Having sustained the replication as a sufficient reply to the
three special pleas, he overruled the demurrer to the replication and adjudged the special pleas bad, and rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of the pridr judgment and
lawful interest.
Errors assigned in this court are as follows: 1. That the
court erred in finding that there is such a record as that mentioned in the declaration. 2. That the court erred in ruling
that the replication is a good and sufficient reply to the three
special pleas. 3. That the court erred in ruling that the Sixth
District Court had jurisdiction of the parties and the cause of
action. 4. That the court erred in the rendition of the judgment.
Before discussing those matters, it becomes necessary to determine the preliminary question whether this court, under
existing laws, has jurisdiction to re-examine the judgment of
the Circuit Court in this case. Prior to the act of the 16th of
February, 1875, all judgments or decrees of the circuit courts
in civil actions at common law or suits in equity, where
the matter in dispute exceeded the sum or value of $2,000,
exclusive of costs, might be re-examined in the Supreme Court
by a writ of error or appeal. 1 Stat. 84; 2 id. 244; 17 id.
196.
Alterations of great moment in the mode of removing certain
final judgments and decrees from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court had been made before the passage of that act; but
the Congress on that day enacted that "such judgments and

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v. JOHNSON.

decrees hereafter rendered shall not be re-examined in the Supreme Court, unless the matter in dispute shall exceed the sum
or value of $5,000, exclusive of costs." 18 id. 316.
Beyond all doubt, the exclusion of jurisdiction to the Supreme
Court is universal in respect to all judgments and decrees of the
Circuit Court where the matter in dispute does not exceed the
sum or value of e5,000. Words more fitting to express such an
intent, or more effectual to that end, cannot be found in our
language, and it is equally clear that they will admit of no
exception unless they are emasculated of their universal meaning; and yet it is suggested that the final judgment or decree
of a circuit court may still, if the record contains a certificate
of the judges of the Circuit Court that they were opposed in
opinion upon any point in the case, be re-examined: in this
court even though the matter barely exceeds the sum or value
of $,500, exclusive of costs, which is the smallest amount cognizable in the Circuit Court in-civil actions at common law or
in suits in equity.
When our judicial system was organized, jurisdiction was
given to the circuit courts, concurrent with the courts of the
several States, of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in
equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of costs,
the sum or value of 500, and the United States are plaintiffs
or petitioners, or an alien is a party, or the suit is between a
citizen of the State where the suit is brought and a citizen of
another State. More than ninety years have elapsed since that
provision was enacted, and yet no alteration has been made in
it as to the amount required to give the circuit courts jurisdiction in suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity.
1 id. 78; 18 id. 470; Rev. Stat., sect. 629.
Judges of the Circuit Court are required to certify, at the
request of either party or their counsel, any division of opinion
occurring between them on the trial or hearing of such a suit,
and the provision is that such certificate shall be entered of
record. Id., sect. 652.
Beyond doubt, either party may require such a certificate to
be entered if any such division of opinion occurred in any civil
action or suit in equity cognizable in the Circuit Court, no
matter if the amount in con trqversy only exceeds by one cent,

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ot.

exclusive of costs, the sum or value of $500. Provision is made
that in admiralty causes the Circuit Court shall find and state
the facts and conclusions of law separately, but the requirement
does not extend to suits in equity; from which it follows that,
if the opinion just read is correct, the Supreme Court must
re-examine the facts, as well as the law in every such final
decree brought here, even though the amount in dispute barely
exceeds $500, merely because the reeord contains-such a certificate of division of opinion, in spite of the express enactment
of Congress that such final decrees shall not be re-examined in
the Supreme Court unless the matter in dispute shall exceed*
the sum or value of $5,00,0.
Certificates of the kind, both in civil and criminal cases, when
made before judgment, as directed by the original act, we,e certified under the seal of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court,
and their effect was to suspend all proceedings in the cause which
would prejudice the merits, until the mandate of the Supreme
Court went down and was filed. 2 Stat. 159.
Mere points were sent up under the sixth section of that act,
nor was the proceeding any bar in a civil suit to a writ of error
or appeal, subsequent to the final judgment or decree, to remove
the whole case into the Supreme Court for re-examination. Matters of difference of opinion between the judges of the Circuit.
Court in criminal cases are still required to be certified here
before judgment or sentence in that mode of procedure, without any change whatever. Every day's experience proves that
proposition; but regulatioiis of a very different character have
been provided where the difference of opinion occurs in civil
actions or suits in equity. 17 Stat. 196; Rev. Stat., sects.
650-652.
Whenever such a difference of opinion shall occur between
the judges of the Circuit Court in a civil action or suit in
equity, the provision is that the opinion of the circuit justice or
circuit judge shall prevail, and be considered the opinion of the
court for the time being; but when the final judgment br decree
in such action or suit shall be entered, it is made the duty of
the judges, in case such a difference of opinion occurred in the
trial or hearing, to make the required certificate of the same, in which event it is provided that either party may remove

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v.

such final judgment or decree into the Supreme Court, on writ
of error or appeal.
Like the original act, the Revised Statutes-require that the
points in difference shall be stated by the judges and certified,
and that such certificate shall be entered of record without any
requirement, as in the original act, that it shall be certified
under the seal of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court at
their next session. Evidently no such proceeding is required,
as it is not contemplated that the certificate of division will
ever come before the Supreme Court for re-examination unless
the final judgment or decree is removed here by writ of error
or appeal. Id., sect. 652.
Existing laws require that final judgments in civil actions
shall precede the writ of error or appeal to remove the cause
into this court for re-examination, no matter whether the questions for revision are raised in the record by a bill of exceptions, a certificate of division of opinion, an agreed statement of
facts, or by demurrer, or even by a special finding of the court,
or by a special verdict. Jurisdictional limitation, prior to the
passage of the act of the 16th of February, 1875, was that the
matter in dispute must exceed the sum or value of $2,000, exclusive of costs; but that act raised the minimum of jurisdiction
from $2,000 to $5,000, as already explained, in all civil actions,
the same section providing that the certificate of division of
opinion in criminal cases shall be made as before, and be certified under the seal of the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.
18 Stat. 316; Rev. Stat., sect. 650.
Circuit-court judgments or decrees in civil actions or suits in
equity, in order that they may be re-examinable in the Supreme
Court, must be final, and the matter in dispute must exceed the
sum or value of $5,000, exclusive of costs; and they must be
removed into the Supreme Court by writ of error or appeal,
apd they cannot be removed here in any other way which will
give this court jurisdiction to reverse or affirm the judgment or
decree. Id., sect. 691; 18 Stat. 316.
Power to re-examine any judgment or decree of the Circuit
Court is not given to the Supreme Court unless the case comes
within that category, the act of Congress now in force proviiing that such judgments and decrees, entered after the act
VOL. X.

12

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Or.

went into operation, "shall not be re-examined in the Supreme
Court unless the matter in dispute shall exceed the sum or
value of $5,000, exclusive of costs."
Prior to the act of June 1, 1872, the certificate of division of
opinion gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction to decide the questions in difference without regard to the amount in dispute, as
it applied both to civil and criminal cases, and in both bad the
effect to suspend action prejudicial to the merits until the decision of the Supreme Court was received. It preceded final
judgment or decree, and was certified to the Supreme Court
under the seal of the Circuit Court. Such certificates in criminal cases are still required to be certified in that way, and still
give the Supreme Court jurisdiction of the points certified,
wholly irrespective of the merits or of any other question in
the case. 17 id. 196.
Since the passage of that act, the proceeding in civil cases
and suits in equity is altogether different, the office of the certificate of division of opinion, like that of a bill of exceptions,
being merely to raise the questions in the record, the requirement that it shall be certified under the seal of the Circuit
Court to the Supreme Court at its next session being entirely
omitted in the new regulation.
Bills of exception are required to place on the record what
rested in parol, and they are allowed in the Circuit Court irrespective of the amount in dispute; but a writ of error will not
lie to remove the cause into the Supreme Court unless the
amount in dispute exceeds the~sum or value of $5,000, exclusive of costs. Where the amount in dispute is less than that
amount, the review takes place on a motion for new trial in
the Circuit Court.
Differences of opinion between the circuit judges may be
certified by them when they sit together, irrespective of the
amount, and the effect is that the certificate becomes part of
the record; and if the amount in dispute is sufficient to give the
Supreme Court jurisdiction, the cause may be removed here by
writ of error or appeal for re-examination; but if the amount
in dispute is insufficient for that purpose, then the only remedy
for the losing party is a motion for new trial in the Circuit
,Court.

Oct. 1879.]

Dow V. JOHNSON.

Other modes for raising questions for review in appellate
courts are well known: as, for example, it may be done by an
agreed statement of facts, or by demurrer to the declaration or
a materibl pleading, or by a special finding of the court, or by
a special verdict, - in all'of which cases the final judgment or
decree may be removed into the Supreme Court by writ of error
or appeal, if the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of
$5,000, exclusive of costs; but if the amount in dispute does
not exceed that amount, the act of Congress is peremptory that
it shall not be re-examined in the Suprem Court.
Under the original act the judges of the Circuit Court were
required to make the certificate and cause it to be certified to
the Supreme Court before final judgment was rendered, but
under the new act the final judgment in civil cases is required
to precede the certificate nor is there any requirement that
the difference of opinion shall ever be certified to the Supreme
Court under the seal of the Circuit Court. 17 Stat. 196.
None of these propositions, it is believed, can be successfully
controverted; and, if not, it follows to a demonstration that this
court has no jurisdiction of the case to reverse or affirm the
decree of the Circuit Court, it appearing that the judgment of
the Circuit Court was only for the sum of $2,650.67. It seems
absurd to hold that jurisdiction exists in such a case, when the
act of Congress provides that judgments and decrees of the circuit courts shall not be re-examined in the Supreme Court
unless the matter in dispute shall exceed the sum or value of
$5,000, exclusive of costs.
Suppose I am wrong in this, then it becomes necessary to reexamine the question whether the Sixth District Court of New
Orleans had jurisdiction of the cause of action and of the par
ties at the time the judgment described in the declaration was
rendered.
It appears that the plaintiff, who was a loyal citizen of New
York, owned a valuable plantation in the parish of Placquemines, situated on the right bank of the Mississippi River,
about forty miles from New Orleans, and that the defendant,
at the time of the service of the writ and of the rendition of
the judgment, was a military officer in the service of the United
States, stationed at the Parapet, near the city; that on the 5th

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. OL.

of September, 1862, a small military detachment, acting under
the verbal and secret orders of the defendant, landed at the
plantation of the plaintiff, and wrongfully, as alleged, took
therefrom and from his dwelling-house there situated the goods
and chattels mentioned in the schedule annexed to the petition
for redress, of the value of $1,611.29. Redress being refused,
the plaintiff instituted the present suit to recover the value of
the property wrongfully seized and detained. Personal service
having been made, and the defendant having neglected and
refused. to appear, he was defaulted. Testimony was taken as
to the circumstances of the seizure and as to the value of the
property converted; and the court, after due consideration,
rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of
$1,454.81. Execution issued, and the sheriff returned that the
defendant could not be found. Satisfaction of the execution
being refused, the plaintiff, on the 30th of March, 1866, instituted the present action of debt to recover the amount of that
judgment.
Apart from the technical defences already considered, the
only defence is that the Sixth District Court of New Orleans
had no jurisdiction of the parties or of the cause of action to render this judgment. Attempt is made to maintain that defence
solely upon the ground that, inasmuch as the defendant was a
military officer in the service of the United States, he was not
amenable to civil process from a court of justice for the taking
of the goods and chattels of the plaintiff at the time and place
-when and where the same were seized and carried away.
Support to that defence is attempted to be drawn from the
fact that the State, on the 26th of January, 1861, passed an
ordinance of secession and joined the rebellion; that war
between the Confederacy and the United States ensued; and
that the war,'at the time the action was commenced and the
judgment rendered, was still flagrant and not ended. Military
officers, it is contended, are not subject to civil process under
such circumstances, even though the acts which are the subject of complaint constitute an abuse of power and were perpetrated without authority.
War undoubtedly followed secession, and it is equally true
that, prior to May 1, 1862, New Orleans was occupied by the

Oct. 1879.]

Dow

v. JOHNSON.

Confederate forces. Rebel dominion in the city, from the passage of the secession ordinance to the date last mentioned, was
complete. Vice-Admiral Farragat reached New Orleans on
the 25th of April, and as flag-officer he demanded the surrender of the city; but the surrender was not made. Transports
conveying the troops under the command of Major-General
Butler arrived on the first day of May. Certain proceedings
followed, which are fully detailed in a prior decision. Suffice
it to say, that this court decided in that case that the military
occupation of the city by the Union forces became complete
May 1, which is the date of the proclamation published by
General Butler. The Venice, 2 Wall. 258-274. There was
no hostile demonstration then nor any subsequent disturbance,
and this court unanimously determined that all the rights and
obligations resulting from such occupation and from the terms
of the proclamation might properly be regarded as existing
from that date.
Two clauses of the proclamation may be referred to as evidencing the intent and public import of the document: 1. That
"all the lights of property of whatever kind will be held inviolate, subject only to the laws of the United States." 2. That
"all foreigners who have not made oath of allegiance" to the
Confederacy "will be protected in their persons and property
as heretofore."
Wherever the national forces were successful in re-establishing the national authority, the rights of persons and of property
were immediately respected and enforced. Persons of intelligence everywhere will see that that proclamation was framed
in the same spirit and with the same intent as that which actuated Congress in passing the first act to suppress insurrection.
12 Stat. 257, sect. 5.
Authority was given to the President by that act, under certain conditions, to declare by proclamation that the inhabitants
of a State or part of a State were in a state of insurrection; and
the provision was, that when that was done all commercial intercourse between such insurrectionary district and the rest of
the United States should cease and be unlawful so long as such
condition of hostility should continue. The .Reform, 5 Wall.
628.

Dow V. JOHNSON.

[u.C
[sup. OrL

Certain States and parts of States were declared to be in insurrection in the proclamation made by the President, Aug. 16,
1861, and in that document he expressly exempted from that
condition all districts or parts of districts which might from time
to time be occupied and controlled by the forces of the United
States engaged in the dispersion of the insurgents. Intercourse
for commercial purposes was not prohibited with such places or
districts while so occupied and controlled. They were not regarded as in actual insurrection, or their inhabitants as subject
to treatment as enemies. 12 Stat. 1262.
Commercial intercourse was never wholly interdicted, and
the regulations were framed in the same spirit of forbearance
towards the places and districts where the national authority
was re-established. "As far as possible," said Chief Justice
Chase, "the people of such parts of the insurgent States as
came under the national occupation and control were treated
as if their relations to the national government had never been
interrupted." The Venice, supra.
Sufficient appears in the Code of Practice of the State to
support the proposition that the district courts of Louisiana
were, before the rebellion, courts of general jurLdiction, as it
provides that their jurisdiction extends over all civil causes
where the amount in dispute exceeds fifty dollars; and this
court, in construing that provision, held that its legal import
was to render those tribunals courts of general jurisdiction in
all civil causes not embraced within the exception. .Fournequet v. Perkins, 7 How. 160, 169; White v. Cannon, 6 Wall.
443-450.
Judgment in this case was rendered in the Sixth District
Court of New Orleans, which was established before the rebellion and bad jurisdiction in all civil causes. Rev. Stats. (La.),
title Judiciary, sect. 72.
Enough appears to show that the Sixth District Court was
created by statute more than fifteen years before the insurrection, and that it was in the full exercise of its jurisdiction when
the secession ordinance was passed; that it was never abolished
or suspended by any military or other order or power; that it
was kept open subsequent to the proclamation of General Butler, the judge and clerk being ii attendance from day to day,

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v.

as business demanded. "Civil causes between party and party,"
said the proclamation, "will be r'eferred to the ordinary tribunals." After General Shepley was appointed military governor,
in August following, the Sixth District Court held its regular
sessions at the time add place fixed by the State statute. Early
after the capture of the city the judge took the oath of allegiance and resumed the proper functions of his office, with the
recognition and approbation of the military authorities. From
the moment the judge of the Sixth District Court took the oath
of illegiance, as required by the commanding general, June 14,
1862, the court continued in the exercise of all its powers, the
same as before the rebellion, and was the only court that did,
until General Shepley, in the fall of that year, appointed judges
in the first, second, and third judicial districts.
Military conquerors of foreign states in time of war may
doubtless displace the courts of the conquered country, and
may establish civil tribunals in their place for administerinlg
justice; and in such cases it is unquestionably true that the
jurisdiction of suits of every description is'transferred to the
new tribunals. United States v. Rice, 4 Wheat. 246; Cross
v. Harrison,16 How. 164. But that concession proves nothing in this case, as it is universally conceded that the mere
occupancy of the territory does not necessarily displace the
local tribunals of justice. Pepin v. Lachenmeyer, 45 N. Y.
27-3. They were not displaced in this case, but suffered to
continue in the exercise of their judicial powers, with the recognition and approbation of the failitary commander.
Important differences exist between.a foreign war waged for
conquest, and a civil war waged to restore insurrectionary districts to their allegiance to the rightful sovereign. Nor could
the commander of the department, after the date of the proclamatiou of General Butler, seize private property as booty of
war, or make any order confiscating it. Planters' Bank v.
Udob Bank, 16 Wall. 483.
On the 17th of August in the same year, General Butler, as
the commander of the department, issued an order requiring
the banks of the city to pay over to the chief quartermaster
of the army all money in their possession belonging to hostile
corporations or hostile official persons. Payments were made

Dow v. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ct.

by the defendant bank, pursuant to that order, of a large
amount deposited by the plaintiff bank. Reimbursement
having been refused, the plaintiff bank brought suit to recover
the amount, and judgment was ultimately rendered in favor of
the plaintiff in the sum of $24,713. Exceptions were filed
by the defendant, and the cause was removed into this court,
where the judgment was affirmed.
Two points were ruled by this court: 1. That the order was
one which the commanding general had no authority to make,
and that it was wholly invalid. 2. That payment to the chief
quartermaster did not satisfy the debt.
In disposing of the case, Mr. Justice Strong remarked, that
the city of New Orleans was then in the quiet possession of the
United States forces; that it had been captured fifteen months
before that time, and that undisturbed possession had been
maintained ever after its capture; that the order was not an
attempt to seize the property flaqrante bello, nor was it a
seizure for the immediate use of the army; that it was an
attempt to confiscate private property, which, though it may be
subjected to confiscation by legislative authority, is, according
to the modern law of nations, exempt from capture as booty of
war.
Concede all that, and still the defendant rests his defence on
the proposition of his third special plea, that the Sixth District
Court had no jurisdiction over the person of the defendant,
because he was a military officer in the army of the United
States, acting under the orders of his superiors. But this is
not the case of. a foreign war in which the courts of the enemy
assumed jurisdiction over an officer of the invading army.
Nothing of the kind is pretended, and if it were, it could not be
supported for a moment. Instead of that, the United States,
throughout the active hostilities, were engaged in putting down
the insurrection and in suppressing the rebellion, with a view
to the re-establishment and complete restoration of the national
authority. Throughout the whole period of the civil war the
government maintained that the ordinances of secession were
void, and that they did not and could not have the effect to
take a State out of the Union or to annul its constitution or
laws.

Oct. 1879.]

Dow v. JOHNSON.

War followed insurrection, but all know that as soon as the
military forces of the United States wrested any portion of
the national territory from the rebellious authorities, and-acquired full and complete control of it, the normal condition of
affairs became restored, as indicated in the first act of Congress
upon the subject, and the proclamation of the President, which
soon followed the passage of that act.
Towns, provinces, and territories, says Halleck, which are
retaken from the conqueror during the war, or. which are re.
stored to their former sovereign by the treaty of peace, are
entitled to the right of postliminy; and the original sovereign
owner, on recovering his dominion over them, whether by force
of arms or by treaty, is bound to restore them to their former
state. In other words, he acquires no new right over them,
either by the act of recapture or of restoration. . . . He rules
not by any newly acquired title which relates back to any
former period, but by his antecedent title, which, in contemplation of law, has never been devested. Halleck, It. Law, 871.
When a town, reduced by the enemy's arms, is retaken by
those of her own sovereign, says Vattel, she is restored to her
former condition, and reinstated in all her rights. Yattel
(ed. by Chitty), 395.
Pressing emergency in time of war may authorize the seiz
ure of private property before providing for compensation,
but, to justify the taking without the consent of the owner,
the necessity must be apparent, leaving no available alternative.
Four months before the marauding expedition, acting under
the verbal and secret orders of the defendant, entered the
plantation and dwelling-house of the plaintiff, during his temporary absence, and seized the goods and chattels mentioned,
the city of New Orleans had fallen into the undisturbed possession of the Union forces under the command of General Butler,
who never authorized the defendant to perpetrate the acts of
plunder charged in the declaration. Evidence of necessity in
this case is wholly wanting, without which the acts charged
in the declaration cannot be justified. Sellards v. Zomes,
5 Bush, 90.
Beyond doubt, he might have appealed to the commanding

Dow V. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ct.

general for an order that the suit should be discontinued; but
he did not, and it may be that his reason for not doing so was
that he knew if he did a court of inquiry would be ordered.
Public order was fully restored in the city, and the courts were
open, and every person 7was in the full enjoyment of the protection promised in the military proclamation issued four
months before, when the Union forces entered the city. Process in due form of law was issued, and personal service having
been made, the defendant, if he had any defence, was bound to
appear and plead it.
Actual insurrection in that locality had ceased, and the military control of the Union forces was substantial, complete, and
permanent; and, being such, it drew after it the full measure of
protection to persons and property consistent with the fact that
the war outside and in other localities had not terminated.
Rebel authority was replaced by the national authority, and all
the inhabitants were in the enjoyment of the protection and
rights promised in the military proclamation then in force.
Hostilities having ceased in that locality, the defendant was
not engaged in any active military operations. His military
duties did not prevent his attendance at the court to make his
defence. No evidence is exhibited in the pleadings showing
any condition of affairs, military or civil, excusing the defendant from rdfusing to obey a judicial summons; and if the court
had no jurisdiction, he should have appeared and so pleaded.
Having neglected to do that at the time, he cannot now attack
the judgment collaterally in a suit brought upon it in another
jurisdiction. When the jurisdiction has attached, the judgment is conclusive for all purposes and is not open to inquiry
upon the merits; and if conclusive in the State where it was
pronounced, it is equally conclusive everywhere in the courts
of the United States. 2 Story, Const., sect. 1813; Cthristmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 802; Mills v. Duryee, 7 Cranch,

It is not even suggested that the military authorities ever
interfered to prevent the suit, and, as matter of fact, it is
known that no such interference ever took place. Instead of
that, the clear inference is that the defendant preferred to submit to the jurisdiction of the court where the suit was brought,

rather than subject himself to a military court of inquiry; and,
if so, it was his own choice, and he cannot now be permitted
to attack the judgment which was rendered in consequence of
his own negligence to appear and plead his defence.
Confirmation of the proposition that it was the duty of the
defendant to appear and plead his defence is derived from the
act of Congress passed for the protection of those prosecuted
for any search, seizure, arrest, or imprisonment made, done, or
committed, or acts omitted to be done under and by virtue of
any order of the President or under his authority, or under
color of any law of Congress, the provision being that "such
defence may be made by special plea or under the general
issue, in the insurrectionary districts in which the national
authority had been resto-red by undisputed possession and control." 12 Stat. 756, sect. 4.
By the fifth section of the same act it is provided that all
civil suits and criminal prosecutions of the character described
in the fourth section, in which final judgment may be rendered
in the Circuit Court, may be carried by writ of error to the
Supreme Court, whatever may be the amount of the judgment.
At the date of the rendition of the judgment in question the
Uilited States had undisturbed possession and control of the
territory embraced within the jurisdiction of the Sixth District
Court, which was fully recognized by the military governor of
the State as a tribunal having full jurisdiction of all civil causes
arising within the judicial district. If the defendant could be
justified, under the fourth section of that act, for the alleged
trespass charged against him, the same section made it his duty
to appear and answer to the judicial summons, and make his
defence by plea.
Reported cases, in great numbers and of high authority, support the proposition that a military officer, except when war is
flagrant or when the courts are silenced by the exigencies of
military rule or martial law, is subject to judicial process for
the abuse of his authority or for wrongful acts done outside of
his military jurisdiction. Jlortyrn v. Fabrigas,1 Cowp. 161, 175.

Plea, the general issue. Trial in the Common Pleas, and verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of £3,000. Exceptions were
filed by the defendant, and he sued out a writ of error and removed the cause into the King's Bench, where Lord Mansfield
gave the opinion of the court, all the other judges of the court
concurring. He held that trespass would lie for an abuse of
power, and he supported the conclusion of the court by stating
a case that occurred in early time, while he was at the bar, in
which a captain in a train of artillery sued the military governor of Gibraltar, who had confirmed the sentence of a courtmartial by which the plaintiff had been tried and sentenced to
be whipped. His Lordship brought the action, and he says that
the governor was ably defended, and, he added, that nobody
ever thought that the action would not lie.
Two other cases were mentioned by that great magistrate,
which were tried before him in the circuit, one of which was a
suit against a military captain, and the other was a suit against
an admiral in the navy, both of which resulted in favor of the
plaintiff. Errors were assigned in the principal case, and the
report shows that the questions were elaborately argued, and
that the judgment of the lower court was unanimously affirmed.

Examples of the kind in the courts of the parent country are
quite numerous, and in every case the alleged wrong-doer was
put to his justification; and if it appeared that the wrongful act
was done without lawful authority, the plaintiff recovered compensation for the injury. 1 Smith, Lead. Cas. (7th ed.), par. I.
1035.
Where the captain of a company imposed a fine upon a soldier, and issued a warrant for its collection, under which the
soldier was imprisoned, and it appeared that the statute conferred no authority upon the captain to issue warrants for the
collection of fines in such cases, it was held, in an action of
trespass brought by the soldier against the captain, that the
plaintiff was entitled to recover. .4alloryv. Bryant, 17 Conn.

It follows that the military commander, after the capture of
New Orleans, had no right to seize private property as booty, or
to confiscate it, for the reason that hostilities had ceased and
the courts were open. Planters'Bank v. Union Bank, 16 Wall.
483; 7 Waite, Actions and Defences, 315.
Without proof of a direct order from the commandant of the
place, the defendant cannot justify his acts as having been authorized by his superior officer, even if that would afford a
justification; for, as Dr. Lushington said in a celebrated case, if
the Ict which he did was in itself wrongful and produced damage
to the plaintiff, he, the plaintiff, must have the same remedy
by action against the wrong-doer, whether the act was his own,
spontaneous and unauthorized, or whether it were done by the
order of the superior power. Agents in such cases are responsible for their tortious acts; but the government is morally bound
to give them indemnity, the rule being, as the court held in that
case, that "the right to compensation in the party injured is
paramount to that consideration." Rogers v. -Dutt, 18 P C. C.

It is not to be questioned, said Phelps, J., that, if a military officer transcend the limits of his authority and take cognizance of a matter not within his jurisdiction, his acts are

lish cases of undoubted authority. Warden v. Bailey, 4 Taunf
65-87.
During the argument, reference was made to the military
order of the 16th of August, 1862, which purported to authorize commanders in certain States to seize property, real
and personal, necessary or convenient for their commands or
other military purposes; but it is clear that that order had no
application in localities within the peaceable possession of the
Union forces, for several reasons, either one of which is sufficient to show that it is a mere afterthought: 1. It could not apply to New Orleans, because if it did it
would contradict and supersede the proclamation of General
Butler, in which he promised that all the rights of property
of whatever kind should be held inviolate.
2. Because it has been solemnly decided by this court that a
military commander of that district, after the said proclamation,
could not seize private property as booty of war. Planters'
Bank v. Union Bank, supra.
8. Because the record shows that the whole district had been
restored to the Union, and that all the inhabitants were in cheerful submission to the Federal Constitution.
4. Because there was no more necessity for seizing private
property as supplies than there would ha-ve been if the Union
forces had been encamped in any one of the great loyal cities
of the North.
Concede the correctness of these suggestions, and two conclusions follow: 1. That this court has no jurisdiction to reverse or affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court. 2. That, if
this court has such jurisdiction, then the judgment of the Circuit Court should be affirmed.
Attention was not called to the question of jurisdiction in
the court below; nor is it probable that the result would have
been different if it had been, as the universal practice in the
Circuit Court is to favor appeals and render every facility to
promote a re-examination of the judgment, unless the right
has been denied by some express decision of the Supreme
Court, or by some explicit and unambiguous congressional
regulation.

Ot. 1879.]

Dow v. JOHNsON.

MRI1. JUSTICE MMILER. Concurring with my brother CLiFFORD that this court is without jurisdiction, because the amount
in controversy does not exceed $5,000, I am content to rest that
point on what he has said.
I also believe that the judgment of the Circuit Court should
be affirmed, for a single reason, which I will state in as few
words as possible.
It is apparent that, very soon after the capture of :New Orleans by our forces, the administration of justice as between
individuals was remitted to the civil courts. The proclamation
of General Butler shows that it was his purpose that such rights
as required for their determination judicial proceedings should
be asserted in the ordinary tribunals, with as little interruption
and as little interference by the military authority as possible.
Evidence of this is to be found in the fact that, without any
change in the judge, who had taken the oath of allegiance, the
Sixth District Court of New Orleans was continued in the
exercise of all its functions, which, uder the proclamation,
included the adjudication of "civil causes between party and
party." It exercised jurisdiction both by the general law of
Louisiana and the express proclamation of the commanding
general. The locality was a part of the United States. The
parties were citizens of the United States. No active military
operations were then carried on within that city or against it;
and for the very reason that its possession had been perfectly
secured by the loyal forces, the civil courts were restored to
the exercise of their ordinary functions in cases between man
and man, or, as the proclamation expresses it, between party
and party. The condition, therefore, was very different from
that when military forces invade and occupy a foreign country, which, before any treaty of peace, or the declaration of any
purpose to annex it to the territory of the conqueror, is held in
armed hostility to its former sovereign, and solely by the strong
hand. In such a case, submission of the inhabitants can only be
maintained by the military power; and to subject that power
to the jurisdiction of the courts of the subjugated country is to
abdicate all control over it.
But in New Orleans it was far otherwise. Our military
forces were rightfully there, and in their own country, among

Dow

V. JOHNSON.

[Sup. Ot.

citizens of the United States, subject to the same paramount
authority, and owing allegiance to the same government. Those
citizens had been only a few months in insurrection, and they
were invited to submit themselves again to the same laws, and
to have their contested rights decided by the same courts, and,
in this case, by the same judge.
In this condition of affairs, Johnson, who was a resident and
citizen, against whose loyalty no charge is made, filed in that
court his petition, in due form of law, setting forth that certain
persons bad, with force and violence, committed a trespass on
his home, and taken therefrom personal property of the value
of several thousand dollars, and charging Dow with being guilty
of this trespass.
The usual process of summons was personally served on Dow,
and on his failure to appear or answer, either by himself or
attorney, a default was entered, and a judgment rendered for
the value of the property taken. This judgment remaining
in full effect, the plaintiff, to enforce the payment of it, brought
the present suit in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Maine, where Dow resides.
The defence-the only defence which could be relied on-is
the alleged total and absolute want of jurisdiction in the Sixth
District Court over the case.
But surely that court did have jurisdiction of an action of
trespass. The plaintiff was not only competent to sue, but
entitled to a remedy in that court, if the cause of action was
such as he declared. It is not denied that the trespasser, bad
he not been a member of the military forces of the United
States, would have been liable to suit, and bound to answer.
But it is said that because Dow was an officer of those forces
he was not bound to answer.
When a proper plaintiff brings an actionable case before a
court which has jurisdiction of it, and due service of process is
made, I hold it to be a principle of universal prevalence that
the question of the defendant's personal exemption from such
process or jurisdiction must, by plea or some other appropriate
mode, be brought before the court. I know of no exceptions
to this rule, which is laid down by all the works on pleading,
from Chitty to the present time. There is no other way in

Oct. 1879.]

Dow

which the court can know of the exemption if it be not unnecessarily stated in the plaintiff's pleading. The court, as
the case stands, has jurisdiction, and must pronounce the judgment of the law. If the party sued deems proper for any
reason to stay away or remain silent, he does so at the peril of
having a judgment rendered against him which cannot be assailed collaterally.
Much is said of the evil of dragging military officers into the
courts under such circumstances. But the military power can
make such general orders as will protect itself against an
abuse of the right which it has expressly recognized. So, the
idea that Dow ought not to have been compelled to leave his
past at Fort St. Philip, to defend this suit in New Orleans, is
of little force. If he had to be found at the fort for service of
process, he could easily have employed a lawyer to put in his
plea in abatement that he was acting under military authority,
and therefore not liable to the suit.
Every man is liable to be sued wrongfully or without cause,
but he is, by the very genius of our laws, bound to submit to
this evil and make defence. Why should not this class of
men, who of all others possess most despotic power, be required
to show the authority by which they exercise it?
If I am not mistaken in these principles, I see no escape
from their controlling influence in the case before us. It is too
well settled to admit of controversy, that a judgment rendered
by a court, having jurisdiction of the parties and the subjectmatter of the suit, can only be impeached by some direct proceeding to avoid it, and that when an action on it is brought in
any other court, no defence can be interposed which should
have teen made in the former suit. General Dow could not,
therefore, set up in the Circuit Court as a bar to the judgment
the same matters that he should have pleaded in the court
which rendered, and was bound to render it.
It is impossible in discussing this matter that memory should
fail to recall a very famous case of historical interest, involving
many of the same principles, which occurred about half a century before this, and of which the same city was the theatre.

general of our forces declared martial law in that citT. This
was unpleasant to many citizens, and to others who claimed to
be foreigners domiciled there at the time. Some of these
becoming restive under its restraints, made publications of a
seditious character in the newspapers, for which they were
arrested by order of General Jackson. When Judge Hall,
of the proper civil court, issued a habeas corpus for their
release, the general tore up the writ and sent the judge by
force beyond his lines. NVithin a very few days after this, the
victory of the 8th of January, 1815, was achieved, and on the
receipt of the news of the treaty of peace the declaration of
martial law was revoked. Judge Hall, on resuming his judicial
functions, issued a process against General Jackson for contempt
of court in his action in reference to the writ of h2abeas corpus.
That distinguished man, though in the midst of the adulation
consequent on the great victory, did not act as the defendant in
this case did, by paying no attention to the process, but came to
the court in citizen's dress, attended only by a single member of
his military family and with his legal adviser. He offered to
read the same paper which his counsel had read against issuing
the process for contempt, and, when the court declined to hear
it, submitted himself to its judgment. At this there was such
a demonstration of ill-feeling in the crowded court-room that
the judge said he could not proceed, and would adjourn the
court. But the noble defender of the city declared that he
was equally ready to defend the court, and begged that the
judge would proceed without fear to do what he might think
his duty required. A fine of $1,000 was entered up against
the general, which he paid at once, and used his authority,
which was needed, to disperse the mob, who were inclined to
violence against the judge.
I confess I have always been taught to believe that Judge
Hall was right in imposing the fine, and that General Jackson
earned the brightest page in his history by paying it, and
gracefully submitting to the judicial power. Such I believe is
the judgment of history and of thoughtful judicial inquirers;
though a grateful country very properly refunded to her favorite general the sum he had paid for a necessary but unauthorized exercise of military power. I have no doubt that General
