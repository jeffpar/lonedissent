TE fourteenth rule of this court declares that no certiorari
for diminution of the record shall be awarded unless the
motion be made at the first.term of the entry of the cause,
and "unless upon special cause shown to the court accounting satisfactorily for the delay."
The present case having been continued to the next term,
.Mr. Casdrigasked leave, although more than one term had
passed since the entry of the cause, to file a suggestion of
diminution of the record. He stated that the counsel in the
case in California had been unaware of the rule requiring
such a suggestion and motion to be made at the first term;
for which reason they had not sent on the papers at an
earlier day; and he submitted the fact as a sufficient reason
for granting the motion now, inasmuch as the cause having
been already continued till the next term, the granting of it
would not cause any delay in the hearing.
In support of this view, he cited Clark v. Hacket* and
Mforgan v. Curtenius.t
THE COURT granted leave, and ordered the certiorari.
