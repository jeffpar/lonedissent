Statement of the ease.

PEARSON V. DUANE.
1. Although a common carrier of passengers by sea, as a master of a steamship, may properly refuse a passage to a person who has been forcibly
expelled by the actual though violent and revolutionary authorities of a
town, under threat of death if he return, and when the bringing back
and landing of such passenger would in the opinion of such master tend
to promote further difficulty-yet this refusal should precede the sailing
of the ship. If the passenger have violated no inflexible rule of the ship
in getting aboard the vessel, have paid or tendered, himself or through
a friend, the passage-money, and have conducted himself properly during the voyage, the master has no right, as matter of law, to stop a returning vessel, put him aboard it, and send him back to the port of departure. And if he do so, damages will be awarded against him on a
proceeding in admiralty.
2. However, where a person who had been thus banished from a place got
on board a vessel going back to it, determined to defy the authorities
there and take his chance of life, and the captain, who had not known
the history of the case until after the vessel was at sea-on meeting a
return steamer, of a line to which his own vessel belonged--stopped his
own and sent the man aboard the returning one, to be t.ken to the port
where he embarked-such captain, not acting in any malice, but acting
from a humane motive, and from a belief that the passenger, if landed
at the port where his own vessel was going, would be hanged-in such
a case, the apprehended danger mitigates the act, and the damages must
be small. Accordingly, in such a case, this court, on appeal from a decree which had given four thousand dollars damages, modified it by
allowing but fifty dollars, with directions, moreover, that each party
should pay his own costs on the appeal.
3. In a case such as above described, a passenger is entitled to compensation
for the injury done him by being put on board the return vessel, so far
as that injury arose from the act of the captain of the other vessel
in putting him'there. But he is not entitled to damages for injuries
that he suffered from obstructions which he afterwards met with in
getting to the place from whence he had been expelled and where he
wanted to return; and which injuries were not caused by this act, but
were owing to the fact that all to whom he afterwards applied for passage to that place knew the power and determination of the adthorities
there and were afraid to carry him back.

IN the month of June, 1856, the steamship Stevens, a common carrier of passengers, of which Pearson was master, on
her regular voyage from Panama to San Francisco, arrived
at the intermediate port of Acapulco, where Duane got on

Statement of the case.

board, with the intention of proceeding to San Francisco.
He had, shortly before this, been banished from that city by
a revolutionary, yet powerful and organized body of men,
called "The Vigilance Committee of San Francisco," upon
penalty of death in case of return. This committee had, in the
fore part of June, against his will, placed him on the Golden
Age, a steamer in the harbor of San Francisco, destined for
Panama, with directions that he'should be conveyed beyond
the limits of California; and he was forcibly carried to the
Mexican port of Acapulco. The presence of the Stevens
afforded the first opportunity to get back, which he was
anxious to embrace, being willing to encounter the risk to
which his return might expose him. Duane went openly on
the boat, at the public gangway, and talked freely with some
of the officers and passengers. It is not certain that the
master knew of his being aboard until after the ship got to
sea, but no directions had been given for his exclusion, and
although he was without a ticket, or money to buy one, yet
a passenger, who had the means, offered to pay the purser
his fare, who declined receiving it.
It was usual for those persons who wished to secure a
passage, to procure a ticket at Acapulco, but there was no
imperative rule of the sh;p requiring i., apd the customary
fare- was often paid to the purser after the boat had left the
port.
There was no evidence that Duane would have been excluded, had the master been aware that he was on board
before he left Acapulco, for it was quite clear that the circumstances of his banishment were unknown at that time.
The master, Pearson, was aware that the Vigilance Committee were in control of San Francisco, and ascertained in
some way that Duane had been expelled by them from California, and if he returned, would be in danger of losing his
life. Having learned this, he resolved to put Duane aboard
the first down ship he met, and send him back to Acapulco.
The steamer Sonora, commanded by Captain Whiting, and
one of the same line of steamers of whvich Pearson was master, very soon came in sight, and was stopped. Whiting in-

formed Pearson that he had orders not to carry back any
banished person, and that Duane would certainly be executed
if he returned, and advised that he should be sent to the
Sonora, and he would endeavor to persuade him to go on
with him.
Thereupon Duane was transferred to the Sonora, and
landed at Acapulco. The transfer was effected without any
personal indignity to Duane, who at first resisted, but was
induced to yield to superior force, by friendly counsels.
Duane did not return to California until the month of
February, 1860. The Vigilance Committee no longer existed,
and he then filed a libel in admiralty for damages, in the
District Court of the Northern District there, setting forth
essentially the facts above stated; that having been expelled
as he was from the Stevens, all efforts to get aboard vessels
going to San Francisco were unavailing; that he went thus
to Aspinwall, in the Republic of New Grenada, to try and
get passage thence to San Francisco, but that a line of
steamers previously existingthere and on which he expected
to go, had been discontinued, its last vessel having set olp
two or three days before his arrival. That finally, through
charity, he obtained a passage to New York, in which city
he was without money or means, his character and reputation blasted, and himself a dependent on charity for subsistence, and was for several months confined in the hospital
there, physically unable to attempt the voyage to San Francisco until February, 1860.
By the 12th article of his libel, he assigned as a reason
for delay in bringing his action, the state of things in San
Francisco, the numerous executions there by the Vigilance
Committee, and his own belief that if he returned his life
would be put in jeopardy; a belief which, he alleged, "existed up to the time of his departure from New York to
California."
The answer, besides a defence from lapse of time, asserted
that the libellant was not "a good or law-abiding citizen of
San Francisco," and that he had "secretly and without any
right or authority so to do, got on board of the Stevens and

remained secreted on board as a stowaway;" and that the
defendant in sending the libellant back on the Sonora, had
been: influenced by humane motives.
The District Court decreed in favor of Duane, with 84000
damages; a decree affirmed in the Circuit Court. Appeal.
MWessrs. Lyon and Alexander HEamilton, Jr., for the appellant:
L The condition of affairs in San Francisco, in July, 1856,
is a matter of public history. It was that of an organized
rule of anarchy, irresistible from its force, and unyielding in
the execution of its purposes. It was submitted to, if not
created by, a body of men otherwise supporters of law, and
was formed to correct an evil which the law could not or did
not reach. In whatever way it judged, it executed its judgments with inflexible certainty. The defendant could not
disregard the existence of this power, nor defy its edicts
because they emanated from an unlawful source. His duty,
in common with every other citizen, was to abstain from
participating in anything which this tribunal had pronounced
hgainst until the supremacy of the law should be re-established. To have taken back an obnoxious exile, would have
been a direct challenge to the Vigilance Committee, which
they would have answered by hanging the victim, under a
sentence already pronounced.
To sustain a recovery, under such a state of facts, for the
refusal of the defendant to carry this exile to the gallows,
would be to disregard the principles on which the law of
common carriers is founded.
The first and most general obligation on the part of the
public carriers of passengers is, without doubt, to carry persons who apply for passage. The obligation is, nevertheless,
subject to several qualifications.
In Jenelcs v. Coleman,* a case before Story, J., it was said:
"The right of passengers to a passage is not an unlimited
right; but is subject to such reasonable regulations as the proprietor may prescribe for the due accommodation of passengers,
* 2 Sumner, 222.

:Dec. 1866.]

D PEARSON V. DUANE.
Argument for the appellant.

and for the due arrangement of their business. The proprietors
have not only this right, but the further right to consult and
provide for their own interests in the management of such boats
as a common incident to their right of property."
"They are not bound to admit passengers on board, who refuse to obey the reasonable regulations of the boat, or who are
guilty of gross and vulgar habits of conduct, or who make disturbance on board, or whose characters are doubtful, or dissolute
or suspicious, and afortiori whose characters are unequivocally
bad; nor are they bound to admit passengers on board, whose
object it is to interfere with the interest or patronage of the
proprietors so as to make the business less lucrative to them.
While, therefore, I agree that steamboat proprietors, holding
themselves out as common carriers, are bound to receive passengers on board under ordinary circumstances, I at the same time
insist that they may refuse to receive them, if there be a reasonable objection.'
The report of this case shows that Mr. Webster, who tried
the case for the plaintiff, made no exception to any of the
propositions involved in this part of the charge.
In Cook v. Gourdon,* a South Carolina case, ir. Justice
Bay, in delivering the opinion of the court, speaking of the
rights and liabilities of ferrymen, says:
"In fact, the law gives him the right of judging when it is
safe and proper for him to cross or not."
In Bennett v. Dutton, in the Supreme Court of New Hampshire,t Chief Justice Parker says:
"We are of opinion that the proprietors of a stage-coach for
the regular transportation of passengers for hire, are bound to
take all passengers who come, so long as they have convenient
accommodation for their safe carriage, unless there is a suffllent
excuse for them for a refusal."
Like innkeepers, carriers of passengers are not bound to
receive all comers.1

Argument for the appellant.

"The character of the applicant,or his condition at the time,
may furnish just grounds for his exclusion, and his object at the
time may furnish a sufficient excuse for a refusal, as if it be to
commit an assault upon another passenger, or to injure the business of the proprietor."
The' fact that the libellant was willing and desirous to
return to San Francisco, makes no difference as to. the defendant's duty. His conduct in acting like a madman did
npt justify the master of the slip in imitating it. The
value or worthlessness of the libellant's life is not involved
in the question. The crime of murder or any lesser breach
of the peace, is an offence against the body politic; in any
measures taken to avoid this, the civil rights of individuals
are subordinate to the requirements of a public duty.
An agent of a railway would be justified in refusing to sell
a ticket to a pugilist on his way to participate in a prize fight,
as would the conductor of a train in putting him off before
reaching the place where the fight is to take place. Will it
be asserted that a disappointed prize-fighter could recover
damages against the carrier for thus averting a flagrant
breach of the peace? . The case before the court is stronger
against a recovery.
If a carrier has reason to suppose that a passenger is en-gaged in canvassing for another line, the law excuses him
for refusing to carry the passenger; or if he is of dissolute
habits and not a fit companion for other passengers, he may
be excluded; how much more is the carrier justified in excluding a person, who he well knew would meet, at the end
of the route, with death at the hands of an armed and organized body of men in open rebellion against the constituted authorities ?
Questions affecting the carriage of persons are comparatively of modern date, the first case coming under the notice
of the court being in 1791, before Lord Kenyon. The carrier of goods, as will be conceded, is held to wider obligations than the carrier of passengers. Yet, if the goods
offered are of a nature which will at the time expose them

to extraordinaqdangeror popular rage, he need not take them.

This was decided in the King's Bench, in -Edwardsv. Sherrat,- a case where the plaintiff had a lot of wheat at Wolverhampton to be sent to Birmingham. There was a great
disposition to riot manifested in the neighborhood, on account of the prevailing scarcity. The mob had pulled down
a corn-mill not far distant, and it was understood that they
had threatened to come to the warehouse where this corn
was deposited. The defendant was a common carrier, by
water, between Birmingham" and Wolverhampton, and on
to lRadford. The plaintiff's agents, finding one of the defendant's boats going by, without any intention of staying at
Wolverbampton, or seeking to take in goods there, stopped
the boat, and prevailed upon the boatman to take in the corn,
which was seized by the rioters at a distance of four or five
mailes from Wolverhampton. The defendant had a verdict,
and opinions were delivered by Lord Kenyon and Barons
Gross, Lawrence, and Le Blanc. Lord Kenyon said:
"All the circumstances and urgency of the case should have
been disclosed to the boatman at the time, and he should have
been asked whether he chose to undertake the risk. Common
honesty would have suggested this; for no man in his senses
would, under these circumstances,have talen the corn under a liability as common carrier."

That is, there being a disposition to riot in the neighborhood, and a reasonable probability that the corn would be
seized by the rioters in case it was taken on board the boat,
the boatman would have been justified in acting upon the
belief, and in refusing to -,ake tho corn.
Baron Gross says, in the same case:
"What are the facts? A boatman, in the night, is induced
to take goods on board under such circumstances as, if the defendant had been apprisedof them, it is clear that he would not have

contracted to receive them as a common carrier."
Almost all legal propositions which are true in the abstract

have their exceptions in applying them.

Thus, no feature

of the common law is more conspicuous than the tenacity
with which it has maintained the sacredness of a man's person. Yet in an indictment for an assault and battery, the
defendant may justify laying his hands upon another to
prevent him from fighing or committing a breach of the peace;*
or to prevent him rescuing goods taken in execution;t or the
like.1 "A man may justify an assault and battery in preventing the commission of a felony,. or a breach of the peace,
or the suppression of a riot."§
In fact, the mere belief, if sincere, that the danger existed,
was enough to justify the captain's conduct.
In the Cbmmonwealth v. Power, in the Supreme Court of
Massachussets, a person named Hall, actually had a ticket,
intending to take passage. He had, however, on a former
occasion, while on the passage, violated the rules of the
company, and Power, the superintendent, now put him out
of the car. The Chief Justice, referring to Hall's former
conduct, uses this language:
"And if he, Hall, gave no notice of his intention to enter
the car as a passenger, and of his right to do so, and if Power
believed that his intention was to violate a subsisting, reasonable
regulation, then he and his assistants were justified in forcibly
removing him from the depot."
In addition, carrying the libellant to San Francisco was
calculated not only to endanger the safety of the ship and
passengers, but would have subjected the cargo to risk, for
which the owners would have been responsible. It has been
held, that the phrase, "king's enemies," does not include
the violence of a mob, or riot, or civil commotion of any
inature.7

Ir. Ashton, contra:
I. "A common carrier for passengers," says Professor Parsons, citing Bennett v. Dittlon,* quoted on the other side, "is
bound to receive all passengers who offer, to carry them the
whole route, to demand no more than the usual and established compensation, to treat all his passengers alike, to behave
to all with civility and propriety, to provide suitable carriages and means of transportation."t
The libellant went publicly on board the Stevens, at Acapulco, and was not refused his passage, and having been
carried from Acapulco, after coming publicly on board, with
the knowledge of Pearson, the captain, and having tendered
his fare, was as much entitled to his passage as any other
person, and his rights were as grossly violated as would have
been those of any other, the most respectable and most respected passengers on board, if the captain had taken a freak
against them and tendered them back their fare, and then
forcibly put them on board the Sonora.
In Coppin v. Braithwaite,j A leading case in England, the
plaintiff was reported to be a pickpocket and associate of
what was called the "swell mob," and as such, beiug found
on board the vessel, though by consent of the officers, it
was determined by the master that he was unfit to be a passenger. He was accordingly disembarked against his will

bad in that it alleged as breach that the defendant, by his
agen; had caused the disembarkation to be conducted in a
scandalous and improper manner, &c., whereby the plaintiff
suffered injury, &c., was emphatically overruled by the court.
It is not pretended that the libellant did anything on the
Stevens that was improper. The only argument is that if
.hearrived at San Francisco he would have been maltreated.
But that was a risk which he had a right to take. The
matter all rested in uncertainty. He had a right to be the
sole judge of it.
II. The damages are a matter which are in the nature of
a finding by a jury, and belonged properly to the case below.
As on questions of fact, brought up here on appeal, this
court, even where it may strictly have a right to reverse,
'will be slow to exercise its action, so here, it will consider
that this matter belonged rather to the court below than to
the appellate tribunal. The question of law, that is to say,
the question whether, under the circumstances, Pearson had
a right to expel Duane, is the only proper question for this
tribunal.
Independently, however, of this, the damnges cannot be
regarded as grossly excessive. The expulsion of Duane was
a great and mortifying indignity to him. It was an injury,
too. He had been banished from San Francisco on the
shortest'notice. He was without funds, of course; and was
unable to return to his former home for years; suffering the
greatest hardships in the mean time over the whole continent.
The act of expulsion by Pearson was, in addition, a great
breach of public rights; rights, at least, which every man is
interested to maintain. The master of a ship has powers
practically despotic. It is of great importance that every
such person be taught that his powers must be exercised in
subjection to law.
Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is interesting, because of certain novel views
which this court is asked to sustain.

Dec. 1866.]

PEARSON v. DUANE.
Opinion of the cou:rt.

Two questions arise in it: 1st, was the conduct of Pearson justifiable? 2d, if not, what should be the proper measure of damages? It is contended, as the life of Duane was in
imminent peril, in case of his return to San Francisco, that
Pearson was justified, in order to save it, in excluding him
from his boat, notwithstanding Duane was willing to take
his chances of being hanged by the Vigilance Committee.
Such a motive is certainly commendable for'its humanity,
and goes very far to excuse the transaction, but does not
justify it. Common carriers of passengers, like the steamship Stevens, are obliged to carry all persons who apply for
passage, if the accommodations are sufficient, unless there is
a proper excuse for refusal.*
If there are reasonable objections to a proposed passenger,
the carrier is not required to take him. In this case, Duane
could have been well refused a passage when he first came
on board the boat, if the circumstances of his banishment
would, in the opinion of the master, have tended to promote
further difficulty, should he be returned to a city where lawless violence was supreme.
But this refusal should have preceded the sailing of the
ship. After the ship had got to sea, it was too late to take
exceptions to the character of a passenger, or to his peculiar
position, provided he violated no inflexible rule of the boat
in getting on board. This was not done, and the defence
that Duane was a "stowaway," and therefore subject to expulsion at any time, is a mere pretence, for the evidence is
clear that he made no attempt to secrete himself until advised of his intended transfer to the Sonora. Although a
railroad or steamboat company can properly refuse to transport a drunken or insane man, or one whose -character is
bad, they cannot expel him, after having admitted him as a
passenger, and received his fare, unless he misbehaves during the journey.t Duane conducted himself properly on the

Opinion of the court.

boat until his expulsion was determined, and when his fare
was tendered to the purser, he was entitled to the same rights
as other passengers. The refusal to carry him was contrary
to law, although th reason for it was a humane one. The
apprehended danger mitigates the act, but affords no legal
justification for it.
But, the sum of four thousand dollars awarded as damages,
in this case, is excessive, bearing no proportion to the injury
received. Duane is entitled to compensation for the injury
done him by being put on board the Sonora, so far as that
injury arose from the act of Pearson in putting him there.
But the outrages which he suffered at the hands of the Vigilance Committee, his forcible abduction from California
and transportation to Acapulco, the difficulties experienced
in getting to New York, and his inability to procure a passage from either Acapulco or Panama to Sari Francisco,
cannot be compensated in this action. The obstructions he
met with in returning to California were wholly due to the
circumstances surrounding him, and were not caused by
Pearson. Every one, doubtless, to whom he applied for
passage, knew the power of the Vigilance Committee, and
were afraid to encounter it, by returning an exile, against
whom the sentence of death had been pronouncQd.
Pearson had no malice or ill-will towards Duane; and, as
the evidence clearly shows, excluded him from his boat, in
the fear that, if returned to San Francisco, he would be put
to death. It was sheer madness for Duane to seek to go
back there. Common prudence required that he should
wait until the violence of the storm blew over, and law and
order were restored.
This course he finally pursued, and he did not return to
California until February, 1860. If he believed, when expelled from the Stevens, that Pearson had done him a great
wrong, he certainly did not when he filed the libel in this
case, for the 12th article is as follows:
"That when libellant was so banished from the State of
California, as aforesaid, by the said Vigilance Committee,
he was threatened with the penalty of death should he ever

return to said State; that libellant was aware that said committee had caused to be executed a number of persons,
without color or warrant of law or right, and that the said
committee had the power and ability to put in execution
their threats, and libellant believed and had reason to believe from the conduct of said I. H. Pearson as aforesaid,
and the treatment he received from the hands of said Vigilance Committee, and their threats as aforesaid, which were
well known to said Pearson, that should he return to said
State, his return, if attempted or if successful, would be impeded and resisted, and his life put in peril and jeopardy,
which belief existed up to the time of his departure from
New York to California."
This is the sworn statement of Duane, that his life was in
peril if he returned to California at an earlier day, for the
conduct of Pearson, to which he refers, was predicated on a
corresponding belief.
It is true, this article in the libel was introduced, by way
of excuse, for not having sooner brought the suit, but the
admissions in it are proper evidence for all purposes. If so,
it is clear that the legal injury which Duane suffered at the
hands of Pearson, can be compensated by a small amount
of money. On a review of the whole case, we are of opinion
that the damages should be reduced to fifty dollars.
It is ordered that this cause be remitted to the Circuit
Court for the District of California, with directions to enter
a decree in favor of the appellee for fifty dollars. It is
further ordered that each party pay his own costs in this
court.
