was the real party in interest, and conducted both suits, and
had recovered, in the first suit, in the name of a trustee, and
in the second, in his own name, as "cestui que trust" of the
equitable estate-as where one suit was in a real or fictitious
lease from John Doe, and the other in the name of Richard
Roe. The jury were instructed that if they believed the
evidence that Patterson was the real party in both suits, the
two verdicts and judgments were conclusive.
But the plaintiff below having deraigned title from the
warrantee, and the plaintiff in error having shown no title,
the question as to the estoppel was of no importance, as the
court were bound to instruct the jury, that without its aid
their verdict should be the same.
The plaintiff in error, having failed to show any error in
the record, the
JUDGMENT IS ArFIRMED.

HUGHES V. 'UNITED STATES
1. The equity of a preumption claimant of land under the laws of the United
States who has complied with the conditions imposed by those laws, obtained his certificate by the payment of the purchase-money, and retained
uninterrupted possession of the property, cannot be defeated by one

whose entry was subsequent, although he has fortified his title with a
patent; such person having notice sufficient to put him on inquiry as to
the interests, legal or equitable, of the predmption claimant.
2. A decree dismissing a bill for matters not involving merits is no bar to a
subsequent suit.
3. A court of equity will set aside a patent of the United States obtained by
mistake or inadvertence of the officers of the land office, on a bill filed
for that purpose by the government when the patent orimO fade passes
the title.
4. Open, notorious, and exclusive possession of real property by parties claiming it is sufficient to put other persons upon inquiry as to the interests,
legal or equitable, held by such parties; and if such other persons neglect
to make the inquiry, they are not entitled to any greater consideration
than if they had made it and had ascertained the actual facts of the case.

]HUGHES V. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the case.

The United States in 1848 filed an information in the nature of a bill in equity in the court just named, against
one Hughes, for the repeal and surrender of their patent for
a tract of land issued to him in 1841; tendering back to him
the purchase-money. The case was thus:
By the act of Congress of April 12th, 1814, every person
who had inhabited and cultivated a tract of land lying in
that portion of the State of Louisiana which had composed
the Territory of Orleans, or in the Territory of lissouri, in
cases where the land was not rightfully claimed by any other
person, and who had not removed from the State or Territory, was entitled to the right of preemption in the purchase
of the land, under conditions and regulations prescribed by
a previous act, passed with reference to certain settlers in
Illinois. The same right was extended by the act to the
legal representatives of the original occupant. Under this
act one (oodbee, in 1822, applied to the register and receiver
of the land office of the district to become a purchaser of a
tract supposed to contain about one hundred and sixty acres,
which had been occupied and cultivated by one Beedle, in
1813, under whose settlement he claimed. His right to preempt the tract was recognized by the officers, and, the required price being paid, the usual certificate was issued to
him. The land at this time was designated as lot number
one, under a special system of surveys authorized by the act
of March 8d, 1811. It was some years later before the general system of surveys into ranges, townships, and sections,
was extended over the country; and when this took place,
the legal subdivision embraced about fifteen acres in excess
over the one hundred and sixty. To this excess, as part of
the original lot, Goodbee's right of preemption under the
regulations of the General Land Office also attached.
t the time he made his entry, Goodbee was in the open
and exclusive possession of the premises, and either he or his
grantees subsequently continued in such possession, and cultivated the land, and erected valuable and permanent improvements thereon.
In 1823, the President, by proclamation, ordered the sale

of the public lands of the district. The proclamation was
general in its terms, embracing all the lands, without excepting such as had been previously preempted or reserved, but
the parcels preempted or reserved were designated by proper
entries in the register of the land office. The tract occupied
by Goodbee was thus designated, and was not offered at the
public sale which took place.
In 1836 Hughes entered this tract at private sale, designating it by section, township, and range,-the proper description under the completed public surveys. The officers
of the land office, overlooking, from the difference in its
description, the fact that the tract had been previously sold
to Goodbee, gave him the usual certificate of purchase and
payment, upon which, in April, 1841, a patent was issued by
the United States.
To the bill or information filed below, Hughes demurred.
The court gave judgment sustaining the demurrer. This
judgment having come on appeal here, at December Term,
1850,* was reversed, the demurrer overruled, and the patent
to Hughes decreed null and void, and ordered to be surrendered. This decree was afterwards, by consent, set aside,
and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court, with leave to
the defendant to answer, and for further proceedings according to equity. He accordingly did answer; the grounds of
defence now set forth being that he had obtained, in the
State courts of Louisiana, two several judgments in two
distinct suits.
The first was, ejectment brought by him against one
Sewall, tenant in possession and claimant of the title under
Goodbee, which suit had gone in his favor.
The second one was brought against him by this same
Sewall and one Hudson (both claimants under Goodbee),
who sought to set aside the patent to Hughes, on the same
allegations of fraud, as it was alleged, and the same exhibition of documents, that at their instance were now set forth
by the United States, in the bill or information filed in the
Circuit Court of the United States.

HUGHES V. UNITED STATES.
Opinion of the court.

This second suit was dismissed for want of jurisdiction
and absence of proper parties-so far as the petition related
to the relief sought by the bill in the present suit-and it
was dismissed generally, because it was defective, uncertain,
and insufficient in the statement of the cause of action.
In the suit of Hughes v. Sewalljudgment was given in favor
of Hughes, on the ground that the court could not, in that
action, look behind the patent to inquire into the equities of
the parties. The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed this
judgment on appeal, but granted a stay of execution until
the validity of the patent could be judicially ascertained.
The Circuit Court of the United States below was of
opinion that no suffiqient defence was shown by the judgments set up, as above stated, and that the United States
were entitled to the relief prayed for, and it decreed accordingly.
The case came here by appeal, and was submitted by 21r.
Stanbery, A. G., and Mr. Ashton, Assistant A. G., for the United
States, and by Mr. Carey, contra.
Mr. Justice FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit is brought to vacate the patent to Hughes, and
compel its surrender for cancellation. It proceeds upon the
ground that the patent was issued in violation of the rights
of Goodbee, or parties deriving title under him, and that
its existence impairs the ability of the government to fulfil
its engagements to him.
By the act of April, 1814, the United States had extended
to Goodbee the privilege of purchasing the land, and had
prescribed the mode of proceeding to make the purchase,
and fixed the price to be paid. When this mode was pursued, and the price was paid, a contract was completed between him and the government, which the latter was bound
to execute by a transfer of the title. The patent to Hughes,
subsequently issued, stood in the way of an efficient and just
execution of this contract. Its operation was either to divest
the United States of the legal title, or, by clouding the title,

HUGHES V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

to impair the security which would otherwise flow from their
conveyance. When this case was here on demurrer,* the
patent was considered by the court to be a valid instrument
conveying the fee of the United States, and, until annulled,
as rendering them incapable of complying with their engagement to Goodbee or his alienees. Whether regarded in that
aspect, or as a void instrument, issued without authority, it
prirn facie passed the title, and, therefore, it was the plain
duty of the United States to seek to vacate and annul the
instrument, to the end that their previous engagement might
be fulfilled by the transfer of a clear title, the only one intended for the purchaser by the act of Congress.
The power of a court of equity, by its decree to vacate and
annul the patent, under the circumstances of this case, is
undoubted. Relief, -vhen deeds or other instruments are
executed by mistake or inadvertence of agents, as well as
upon false suggestions, is a common head of equity jurisdiction.
The patentee cannot complain of the proceeding, for the
open, notorious, and exclusive possession of the premises, by
the parties claiming under Goodbee, when the patentee
made his entry and received the patent, was sufficient to put
him upon inquiry as to the interests, legal or equitable, held
by them; and if he neglected to make the inquiry, he is not
entitled to any greater consideration than if he had made it
and ascertained the actual facts of the case.
The judgments recovered by Hughes in the State court
of Louisiana-one in an action brought by him against
Sewall, and one in an action brought against him by Sewall
and Hudson-constituted no bar to this suit. The first case
was ejectment against Sewall, who was at the time in the
occupation of the laud, and judgment passed in Hughes's
favor, on the ground that the court could not, in that form
of action, go behind the patent and inquire into the equities
of the parties. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed by
the Supreme Court of the State, but was accompanied with

a stay of execution until the validity, of the patent should
be judicially ascertained.
The second case was a petitory action, brought by Sewall
and Hudson, claimants under Goodbee, having for its object
the vacation of the patent, the annulment of the above judgment against Sewall, then pending on appeal ih the Supreme
Court of the State, the recovery of damages, and the obtaining of an injunction. No judgment was passed upon
the merits of any matter alleged. The petition was dis.
missed for want of jurisdiction and the absence of proper
parties, so far as it related to the special relief sought by this
suit-the vacation and surrender of the patent-and it was
dismissed generally on the ground that it was "defective,
uncertain, and insufficient in the statement of the cause of
action."
It requires no argument to show that judgments like these
are no bar to the present suit. In order that a judgment
may constitute a bar to another suit, it must be rendered in
a proceeding between the same parties or their privies, and
the point of controversy must be the same in both cases, and
must be determined on its merits. If the first suit was dismissed for defect of pleadings, or parties, or a misconception
of the form of proceeding, or the want of jurisdiction, or
was disposed of on any ground which did not go to the merits
of the action, the judgment rendered will prove no bar to
another suit.*
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
