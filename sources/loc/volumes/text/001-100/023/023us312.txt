The District Courts have jurisdiction, under the Slave Trade; Acts,

77. and directing the proceeds of the sale of the negroes to bb

In order to constitute a valid seizure, so as to entitle the party to the
proceeds of a forfeiture, there must be an open, visible possession
claimed, and authority exercised, under the seizure.
A -seizure, once voluntarily abandoned, loses its validity.
A seizure, hot followed by an actual prosecution, or by a claim, in
the District Court, before a.hearing on the merits, insisting on-the
benefit-of the seizure, becomes a nullity.
Under the 7th section of the Slave Trade Act of 1807, c. 77. *the
entire proceed$ of the vessel are forfeited to the use of the U'ited
States, unless the seizure be made by armed vessels of the navy;

APPEAL firom the Circuit Court of Louisiana.

OF THE UNITED STATES.

This is the same case which was reported ante,
vol. 5. p. 338.

It was a proceeding against the

vessel, and the negroes taken on board of her,
under the Slave Trade Act of the 3d of March,
1807. c. 77. in which the vessel was condemned
in the Court below, and that decree was affirmed
on appeal, by this Court. After the con demnation of the vessel in the District Court, and be-fore the appeal to this Court, the negroes found
on board of her wema. (under-the 4th section 'of
the act of Congress, and under an act of the
State of Louisiana, passed on the 13th of March,
1818, in pursuance of the act of Congress,) delivered by the Collector of the Customs for the
port .of New-Orleans, to the Sheriff of the parish
of New-Orleans, for sale t .cording to law. A
cross libel was afterwards filed by the alleged
original Spanish owners, claiming restitution of
the negroes, which was dismissed, and, on appeal, the decree affirmed by this Court. By consent of all the parties in interest, the negroes
were sold by the Sheriff, and the proceeds lodged
in the Bank of the United States, subjdct to the
order of the Court below. After thie cause. had
been remanded to the District Court, a qi .estion
arose in that Court respecting the ma-irer in
which these proceeds, as well as those of the
vessel and effects, were to-be distributed, and the
parties -respectively entitled to them. Mr. Roberts, an inspector of the revenue, claimed a
moiety of the proceeds as the original seizor or
captor;. Messrs. Gardner, Meade, and Humphrey,
respectively, made similar claims under sub4'

claiming the property of the negroes, having been
filed by the Spanish owners, (which was. afterwards dismissed, and on appeal, the dismissal
confirmed by this Court,) by consent of all the
parties in .interest,- the negroes were sold by the
Sheriff, and the proceeds lodged in the Bank of

of this sale, as well as of the sale of the vessel
and-effects, are to be distributed, and the parties
who are entitled to them. Mr. Roberts, who is
an Inspector of the Customs, claims title as the

The Josefa Segunda .was finally condemned
under the seyenth section of the Slave Trade
Act, of the 2d of March, 1807, ch.'77. It will be
necessary to refer:to the terms ofthat section at
large, because the question heke respects as well
the distribution of the* proceeds of the iesse1
(which must be made according to the 'rules prescribed in that section,) as of the 15roceeds of the
sale of the negroes, who were unlaw'fully'brought
into the United States; and, in the progress of
the discussion, it will materially aid us in the decision of the latter, to. ascertain who, by the construction of that section, are the captors entitled
to the distribution. of the .former.
The fourth section of the act of 1807 provides,
that "neither the importer, nor any person or
persons. .claiming from or under him, shall hold
any riglit or title whatsoever to any.negro, &c.
w.ho may be imported or brought within theUnited States, or territories thereof, in violation

upon a full consideration of the act of 1807, we

by the express provisioni of the act of 1807, the

the negroes are also to be taken possession of, 1825.
for the purpose of being delivered over to the The 3osda

State governments, according to the provision
of the act; and it is obvious, that this d~livery
can-only be after a condemnation has occurred,
since it is only in tat event ihat the State Legislature can acquire any right to dispose of them.
The proviso in the seventh section; that the
offcers to whom a moiety of the proceeds is
given on condemnation, shall be so entitled only
in case they'safely keep and deliver over the negroes according to the laws of the States, operates by way of condition to the completion of
their title; but does not import any requirement
that the delivery shall be until after the condemnation. On the cpntrary, as by a decree of restitution of the vessel and effects, the claimants
would be entitled to a restitution of the negroes,
the reasonable construction seems to be, that
they remainssubject to the order of the District
Court, as property 'in the custody of the law,
though in the actual possession of the 3eizing
officers. The possession. of -the-latter is the possession of the Court, as much in respect to. the
negroes as the vessel and cargo; and it must remain until the Court, by pronouncing a inaI decree, directs in what manner it is to be surre.adered. In the present case, the negroes were
sold, and the proceeds substituted for them were.
in the custody of thet Court. It was, therefore,
authorized to deliver them over to the parties
who should be entitled, under the State law. In

The 3osefa parties were to whose use the Sheriff. must hold

be awarded by the Court, to whom, as an incident to the principal cause, it exclusively belonged. In what manner could any other Court
be authorized to ascertain who was the commanding officer of the capturing vessel? The
dedree of the Court, in distributing the proceeds
of the vessel and cargo, must necessarily involve
this inquiry; and certainly it cannot for a moment be maintained in argument, that any other
person than the commander of the capturing
vessel, who would share the proceeds of the prize
and 'her cargo, could be within- thc meaning of
the law of Louisiana. The common form of
-drawing up decrees; imcases of condemnation, is,
that' the proceeds be distributed according to
law. But if any difficulty arises, upon petition,
the Court always proceeds to decide who are the
parties entitled to distribution, and to make i
supplementary decree. But it may do the same
in the first instance, 'and make the particulars of
the distribution a part Qf the original decree. In
the present case, if the original decree had been
drawn out at laxge. it ought to have been, that the
negroes so captured be delivered over to the Sheriff of New-Orleans for sale, according to the ac.
of Louisiana in this behalf provided, and that thd
netproceeds of the sale be afterwards paid over;

of New-Orleans.

This course of proceeding is

1825.

very familiar in prize causes; where the Court Th~e Jos efa

of Admiralty always ascertains who are the captors entitled to the prize proceeds; and the
Courts of common law will never entertain any
jurisdiction over the proceeds until after such adjudication. Considering this cause, then, as a
cause of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, belonging exclusively to the Courts of the United
States, we are not aware how any other Court
could adjudge upon the question who -were the
captors or seizors entitled to share -the proceeds;
and we think that the District Court has jurisdiction over the present proceedings.

notice, agrees to submit, and actually submits, to
the command and control of the seizing officer,

Mr. Roberts gave no notice of the seizure to the

persons on board; he exercised no authority, and
claimed no possession. He had- no force adequate to compel submission; and his appearance
in the vessel gave no other character to him than
that of an inspector, rightfully on board, in performance of his ordinary duties. To construe
such an equivocal act as. a seizure, would be unsettling principles.
Messrs. Humphrey, Meade, aqd Gardner, certainly did make a seizure, by their open possession.
of the vessel, -andbringing her under the guns. of
Fort St. Philip. But there is this objection to the

Mr. Roberts, if he made one, does not seem to

without the influence of superior force, loses all
its validity, and becomes a complete nullity. Like
the common case of a capture at sea,,and a voluntary abandonment, it leaves.the property open
to the next occupant. But what is decisive in
our view is, that neither of these gentlemen ever
attempted any prosecution, or intervened in the
original proceedings in the Distr.-t Court, claiming to be seizors, which was :no spensable to

was, for the first time, made after a final decree 1825.
of condemnation in the Supreme Court. This The Joser
was certainly a direct waiver of any right acquired Seunda.
by their original seizures. It is not permitted to
parties to lie by, and allow other persop,3 to incur
al the hazards and responsibility of being held
to damages in case the seizure, turns out to be
wrongfiul, and then to come in, after the peril is
over, and clairethe whole reward. Such, a proceeding would be utterly unjust,- and inadmissible. If the parties meant to have insisted on
any right, as seizors, their duty was to have intervened in the District Court before thi hearing on the merits, according to the course pointed out by Lord Hale in the passage cited at the.
bar, where there are several persons claiming to
be seizors of forfeited property. In the present
case, Mr. Chew actually advanced a considerable.
sum of money for the maintenance of these negroes during the pendency of the suit ; and if it
bad been unsuccessful he must have exclusively
borne the loss. Upon the plain ground, then,
that Mr. Roberts, and Messrs. Humphrey, Meade,
and Gardner, have not followed up their seizure
by any prosecution, such as the act of 1807 rea Harg.Law Tract8, (4to.) p. 227. " At. common law, any
person might seize uncustomed goods to the use of the king and
himself, arid thereupon inform for a seizure. -But yet, if A. seize
goods uniustomed, and then B. seize them for the same cause, he
that first seizeth ought to be preferred as the informer. And,
therefore, if B., that seized after, first informa, and A. also inform,
A. may be admitted to interplead with B., upon the priority of
the seizure, before the merchant shall be put to answer. either."

That Mr. Chew, on behalf of himself, and the
Segunda.
Surveyor and Naval Officer of the port of NerQrleans, did make-the seizure on. which the prosecution in this case was founded, is completely
proved by the evidence; it is also admitted by
the United States, in their answer to the libel of
Messrs. Carricaber'a, &c.. the Spanish claimants,
and is averred by Mr. Chew, and his coadjutors,
in their separate allegation and answer.to the
same libel. While -the vessel lay at Fort St. Philip, armed boats, under revenue officers, were sent
down by him, with orders to seize her, and bring
her up to New-Orleans for prosecution, which
was done accordingly.
The remaining question then is, whether Mr.
Chew, for himself and his coadjutors in office,
isto be considered as entitled to the proceeds of
the vessel under the act of Congress, and to
the proceeds of the negroes, as "the'commanding officer of the capturing vessel," within the
sense of the Louisiana law.
If he is entitled to the proceeds of the vessel
and cargo, under the 7th section of the act of
1807, then, we think, he must be fairly considered as within the spirit, if not the letter, of the act
of Louisiana.
The 7'gh section is certainly not-without difficulty in its construction. In the first clause it
declares, that vessels found " in any river, port,
bay, or harbour, or on the high seas, within the
jurisdictional limits of the United States, or

act, shall be forfeited to the use of the United
States, and may be seized, prosecuted, and condemned, in any Court of the United States having jurisdiction thereof." Under this clause,
standing alone, it cannot be doubted, that any
person might lawfully seize such a vessel at his
peril, and if the United States should .choose'.to
adopt his act, and proceed to adjudication, he
would, in the event of a condemnation, be completely justified. But it may. be considered as
peculiarly the duty of the officers of the customs,
to watch- over any maritime infractions of the
laws of the United States; and,' by the Collection Act of 1799, (ch. 128. s. 70.) it is made the
duty of'all custom-house officers, as well within
their Districts as without, to make seizures of all
vessels violating the revenue laws.
The section, then, in-the next clause, authorizes the President of the United States to employ
any of the arned vessels of the United States to
cruise on any part of the coast, to prevent violatiorns of the act, and to instruct and direct the
commanders of such armed vessels, to seize all
vessels contravening the act, " wheresoever
found on the high seas," omitting the words, " in
any river, port, bay, or harbour," contained in the
former clause. It then proceeds to declare, that
the proceeds of all such vessels, when condemned,
" shall .be divided equally between the United
States, and the officers and men, who shall make

such seizure, take or bring the same into port for
condemnation, whether such service be made by
an armed vessel of the United States, or revenue
cutters' thcreof, and the same shall be distributed
in like manner as is provided by law for the distribution of prizes taken from an enemy." In a
strict sense, the present seizure was not made by
an armed vessel of the United States, nor by a
revenue cutter, which, by the act of 1799; (oh..
128. s. 98.) the President is at liberty to require
to co-operate with the navy. But if we consider
these cases as put only byway of example, or if we
give an enlarged meaningto the w6rds "revenue

the Collector is, by the act of 1799, (ch. 128. s.
101.) authorized to employ, with the approbation
of the Treasury department, then the seizure of
Mr. Chew may be brought'within the general
terms of the act. The United States do not appear to have resisted this construction as to the
proceeds. of the sale of the Jose'fa Segunda.
And, on the other hand, *if we consider, that
the act meant to deal out .the' same.rights to
all parties who might seize the offending vessel, whether they w~re officers of armed vessels,
or of revenue cuitters, or merely priv'ate individuals, who may seize and prosecute to condenin.tion, then, under that construction, Mr. Chen

Upon the bist consideration which we have Segunda.
been able to give the case, we are of opinion,
that it is a casus omissus, or rather, that all the
beneficial interest vests in the United States.
The first clause of 'the seventh section declares,
that all vessels offending against it, " shall be
forfeited to the use of the United' States," and
may be seized, prosecuted, and condemned, accordingly. The seizure may be made by. any*
person ; but the forfeiture is still to be, by the
terms of the act, for the use of the United Stdtes..
If the act had stopped here, no difficulty in its
construction could have occurred. As nothing is
given by it to the seizing officer, nothing. could
be claimed by him except from the bounty of
the government. The subsequent clause looks
exclusively to cases where the seizure is made by
armed vessels of the navy, or by revenue cutters,
and directs, in such an, event, a distribution.io be
made in the same manner as in cases of prizes
taken, from an enemy. , Correctly speaking, these
cases constitute exceptions from the preceding
clause, and take them',out of the general foifeiture " to the use of the United States." It might
have been a wise policy to have extended the benefit of these provisions much farther, or to have
given, as the act of the 20th of April, 18.18, (ch85.) has given, a moiety in all cases to the person
who should prosecute the seizure to effect. But
Court's- of law can deal with questions of this

But as the act has made no provision for his
compensation, he must be left, in common with
those who made the military seizure, to the liberality of the government.
The remarks which have been already made,
dispose of the case, so far as respects the proceeds of the vessel, and we think they are decisive as to the claim to the proceeds of sale of
the negroes. The case as to this matter is also
a casus omissus in the act of Louisiana. That
act had a direct reference to the act of Congress,
and " the commanding officer of the capturing
vessel," in the sense of the former, must mean the
commamding officer of such an armed vessel, or
revenue cutter, as is entitled to share in the distribution of the proceeds by the latter. It would
be going very far to give a larger construction to
the words than. in their strict form they import;
and since they admit of a reasonable interpretation, by confining them to the cases provided for
by Congress, we are satisfied that our duty is
complied with, by assigning to them this unembarrassed limitation.
The decree of the District Court, so far as it dismisses the claims of Messrs. Roberts, Humphrey,
Mead, and Gardner, is affirmed, and so far as it
sustains the claim of Mr. CheW, and the Naval
Officer and Surveyor of the port of New-Orleans,
is reversed.
Decree accordingly.
