amount of damages, and before the report of the '00,-*
commissioners bad been acted upon by that
Court, the appeal was taken. The question was,
whether the appeal was not taken too early, the
Judiciary Act of March 3, 1803, c. 353. [xciii.]
having confined the right of appeal to "final de.crees."
Mr. Tazewell, contra, stated, that in -the Dis-trict Court .there was a. decree of restitution
and a denial of damages. Both parties appealed from that decree, the libellarits being dissatisfied with -'the decr.ee of restitution, and the
claimants with the denial of damages. These
were, then, cross-appeals, and consequently there might be an appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court."decr.eeing restitution, and affirming.
in this r.espect,, the decree of the District Court,
although th'e decree of the Circuit.Court, reversing that of the District Court as to damages,
and awarding the latter to .the claimants, was as
vet undetermine.d.

Mr. Chief Justicle MARSHALL -delivered the opi- FPeb. ±-o1l
nidn of the Court.
The Court has had the question submitted in
this cause under corisiderat*ion, and is of opinion, that the appeal is not well taken. The
decre

upon that part of the decree awarding damages.
The whole cause is not, therefore, finally deterPalmyra.mined in the Circuit Court ; and we are of opinion that the cause cannot be divided, sb as to
bring up successively distinct parts of it.
The ease in. 3 Cranich, 179. is essentially different. In that case, which was an appeal in an
equity cause, there was a decree of foreclosure
and sale of the mortgaged property. The sale
could only be ordered after an account taken, or
the sum due on the mortgage ascertained in some
other way; and the usual decree is, that unless
the defendant shall pay that sum in a given time,
the estate shall be sold. The decree of sale
Lherefore is, in such a case, final upon the rights
of the parties in controversy, and leaves ministerial duties onlv to be performed.
Appeal dismissed.4
