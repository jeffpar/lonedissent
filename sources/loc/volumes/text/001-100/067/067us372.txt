CO.,

VS.

SCUDDER, ADM3'R OF VAN

PELT.

A person residing in California, employed an agent to contract
for, and superintend the building of a ship at New York.
The agent was furnished with funds for the purpose, and specially directed by the principal to give himself'out as the true
owner, and to conceal the interest of the principal. Accordingly the agent made all contracts in his own name, and had
the vessel registered as his own property. After she was
finished he 'sold her, and put the price in his pocket:Held, That the principal's right in the vessel was gone, unless
he could prove that the vendee had notice of his right before
payment of the purchase money.

2. As between the principal and agent themselves, the legal title
of the latter could not avail him, except as a lien for his services and money advanced, but the rule is different as respects
a third person who has bought in good faith and for a valuable
consideration.
3. When a question arises between two innocent parties, which of
them shall suffer by the misconduct of another, the loss must
fall upon him who has enabled the wrong to be committed,
and not on him who had no means of knowing that it was a
wrong.
4. If the equitable owner of a thi, has permitted another to hold
the legal title accompanied with the usual documentary evidence of it, with full possession and with declarations of
ownership corresponding to the legal title lie cannot set up
his equity against a bona fide purchaser, who hot no noti,'
of it.
5. Secret instructions from the equitable to the legal owner, which
produced no change in the apparent relation of the latter to
the thing will not affect the right of the purchaser.
The burden of proof rests upon the equitable owner, to show
that the purchaser had notice of his rights in due time.
7 Where the purchase has been made for a full price and on fair
conditions without special ad-,antage to the vendee, the proofs
to impeach it ought to be more full and direct, more unequivocal and certain than would be required in the case of a hard
or unequal bargain.

Calais $t1amboat Coinpany vs. Van Pelt's Administrator.
Appeal from the Cixcuit Court of the United States for the
District of.Maine.
Hr Iurtis and Mr. Hutchins of Massachugetts, for appellant.
H,?. Shepley, of Maine, for appellee.
Mr. Justice NELSON. This is an appeal.from a decree of the
Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Maine.
The bill was filed in the Court below by Scudder, the
administrator of John Van Pelt, deceased, against the Steamboat
C opnpany, claiming title to thirteen-twentieths of -the Steamer
Adelaide, as belonging to the estate of his intestate, and a consequence of this interest to the complainant, an account of her
earnings, &c.
The respondent set up, by way of defense, title to the whule
of the steamer as bona fide purchasers and for full value from
one William W. Vanderbilt, in the city of New York.
The case discloses that John Van Pelt, a resident of California,
in the spring of 1853, employed Vanderbilt, an engineer and
constructor of steamers, to visit the city of New York and there
enter into contracts, and superintend the construction of the
steamer in question, he, Van Pelt, furnishing the necessary
means for the purpose. The contracts were to be made in the
name of Vanderbilt, the builders' certificate to be taken and the
enrolment, at the custom-house, made in his name as owner.
This instruction was given by Vain Pelt to Vanderbilt for the
avowed purpose:of concealing his own name in the construction
of the vessel, as, for reasons not material to state, he did not wish
it to be known in the city of New York, or in California, that he
was interested in I er. He was very specific and urgent on this
point; for, in one of his last letters to Vanderbilt, written at his
request, 13th September, 1853, (he died on the 29th,) he says,
"You are not to know that he (Van Pelt) has any interest in
the boat; and, that you must be more particular in talking and
writing about her and her destination."
The boat was built in New York in .pursuance of this
authority'and these instructions. The contracts were entered

into for the hull and engines, in July, 1853; for joiner- york
painting, &c., at a later date. All made in the name of V.'nderbilt. She was finished in September, 1854. In the latter part
of August of the same year, two agents of the respondents
visited the city of New York for the purpose of buying a steamboat to be put on their line of steamers in the place of one
disabled, and saw or had seen the steamer in question advertised
in the daily city papers for sale. And, on application to Vanderbilt, and after examination of the vessel and the usual
negotiations as to price, on the third of August the purchase
was made for the sum of $88,000-$5,000 paid down, $15,000
23d August, and the balance 9th September. Vanderbilt, after
having procured the usual builder's certificate, to which he was
entitled as contractor for the building of the vessel, had heenrolled in his own name as owner; and then, on the 9th September, executed a bill of sale to the purchasers, under whom
the respondents claim title.
Upon this simple statement of the case, it is not to be doubted
but that the legal title to this vessel passed to the purchasers;
for, although as between Vanderbilt and Van Pelt, his principal,
or the estate of Van Pelt, the legal title could not avail, beyond
a lien for his services or for any advances; yet, as it respects
third persons, who have bought in good faith and for a valuable
consideration, the rule is different. The question then arises
between two innocent parties, and the equity of the case turns
against the party who has enabled his agent or any other person
to hold himself forth to the world as having not only possessiqn,
but the usual documentary evidence of property in the article.
3 B. & Or., 38; 4 D. & A., S. C; 8 Cow., 238.
The case furnishes a very strong illustration of this principle.
All the indicia of property in this vessel in Vanderbilt existed
from no fault of his, for be was clothed with it by the express
authority of the principal. Van Pelt, therefore, took upon himself knowingly the responsibility of vesting the property of the
vessel in Vanderbilt, as he must have known that it was in his
power to deal with it as owner. Besides, he was extensively
engaged in the business of steamboats in the waters of California.

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.

and doubtless understood, in point of fact, the responsibility he
was assuming. Van Pelt died in September, 1853, while this
vessel was under contract for construction. The event, however,
did not interfere with it, as his legal representatives continued
the arrangement the same after as before-furnishing the necessary funds, and carrying on the work till the vessel was finished.
They took the place of Van Pelt.
In order to weaken this view of the case, it is said that Van
Pelt, before his death, changed the agency of Vanderbilt by the
appointment of one D. P. Vail. If this were conceded, unless
it had the effect to change the apparept ownership of the vessel
in Vanderbilt, thae circumstances would be immaterial. No secret
arrangements between the parties could affect third persons But
there was no change in the instructions to Vanderbilt of any
importance in the case. The authority of Vail was confined to
'he furnishing of the vessel after she was finished, and to tie
taking charge of her as Captain in carrying her to California,
The funds furnished by the owners passed through his hands ic,
Vanderbilt. In one of the last letters written by Van Pelt,
1st September, 1853, to Vanderbilt, before his death, he says- speaking of the vessel-" I wish the bill of sale to be made for
D. P. Vail, ten-twentieths; R. Chenery, four-twentieths; R. M..
Jessup, three-twentieths; W. W. Vanderbilt, two-twentieths; and
Frank Johnson, one-twentieth."
These instructions to Vanderbilt related to his disposition of
the vessel after her completion, the names and shares representing the owners, and their interest. The ten-twentieths in Vail's
name represented the interest of Van Pelt, and was placed there
to conceal his interest agreeably to his original purpose.
These instructions, whatever may have been their effect upon
the parties concerned, had none as it respected the apparent
relation of Vanderbilt to the vessel. He remained in possession
of her and of all the documentary evidence of property, and was
thus held out to the world as the legal owner. Indeed, no change
.w,.: '.ontemplated in this letter till the boat was finished. Van
derbilt then was to give a bill of sale to the persons-named, Van
Pi-t's interest still to be concealed. We lay out of the case,

SUPREME COURT.
Calais Steamboat Company vs. Van Pelt's Administrator.
therefore, all the evidence in respect to the connection of Vail
with the construction of the vessel, as in no way affecting the
ostensible ownership of her by Vanderbilt.
It is insisted, however, that, assuming the respondents obtained
the legal title of the vessel by the purchase and bill of sale of
Vanderbilt, still the title was defective, inasmuch as they are
chargeable with notice of the equitable interest of the estate of
Van Pelt. This, in our view of the case, is the only serious
question in it.
It is admitted that the respondents paid the full value of the
vessel at the time of the purcbase-88,000. They had no
motive, therefore, to make the purchase of a vessel of doubtful
or defective title. So far as regards the contract of purchase
itself, its terms and conditions, there is nothing inconsistent with
the most entire good faith. If th6 vessel had been purchased
under her value, or the mode of payment had been prejudicial
to the vendor, or any special gain had been achieved by the
purchasers, the Court would necessarily approach this question
of notice with very different impressions from those proper in
this case. Down to this point, the evidence of good faith is
undeniable, and must be overcome by the proofs of the adverse
party. We go one step further; with such evidence of good
faith from the terms and conditions of the contract itself, the
proofs to overcome it should be more full and direct, more unequivocal and certain than in the case of a like impeachment of
a hard and unequal bargain.
Before we enter upon the proofs on this point, it may be well
to ascertain, with some degree of exactness, the precise practical
question involved in this charge of notice.
The estate of Van Pelt claims thirteen-twentieths of the
vessel, on the ground that the funds of Van Pelt in his lifetime,
and of his estate since his death, were furnished to the extent of
this interest to build the vessel. The claim is for a latent
equitable interest resting in the heirs or personal representatives of the intestate. The remaining interests in the vessel are
not in question It is admitted the other owners authorized the
sale, and have eceived their share of the purchase money The

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
Calais Steamboat Company vs. Varn .Pelt'sAdministrator.
case, therefore, is brought down to the single question, are the
respondents chargeable with notice of this outstanding equitable
interest in the vessel at the time of the purchase?
Our first remark is, that all.the parties concerned in or connected with the purchase deny ntice, and testify to the good
faith of the transaction. Vanderbilt and Vail, who were concerned in the sale, and Deming and Todd in the purchase-four
persons, each of unimpeachable characters.
This position is sought to be impaired by a critical examination of the testimony of Vanderbilt and Vail, who were examined
on interrogatories, and isolated answers are seized on for the
purpose of weakening the general denial, and establishing the
fact of notice. We shall not go into the detail, but content ourself by stating that we have very diligently examined all the
answers of these witnesses relied on in connection with the whole
of their testimony on the subject, and they come to this-that
the purchasers were advised there were parties in California who
had advanced money towards building the vessel; that she was
originally intended for employment in the waters of that State;
that this purpose had been changed; and that they wished the
boat sold, and that they, Vanderbilt and Vail, were authorized
to sell her. Now this taken together furnishes neither notice of
the equity of the estate of Van Pelt in the vessel to the purchasers, nor is it sufficient even to put them on inquiry. It must
be recollected: that the burdeni of proof rests upon the complainant. Taking the whole statement as true and entitled to belief,
there is nothing in it to excite the apprehensions of even a
prudent business man; for at the same time the purchasers were
advised of advances or interests of persons in California, they
were advised they had authorized the sale. One part of this
statement was as much entitled to belief as the other. The
case falls within the principle stated by Lord Lyndhurst in Jone.3
vs. Smith, (1 Phillip, Oh. R., 244).
. It must be*remembered that this was not a purchase under a
power of attorney, and hence a necessity to look to the power
and see to the authoritjr.
The purchase was from the apparent owner, possessed of all

SUPREME COURT.
Calais Steamboat Company vs. Van Pelt's Administrator.
the indicia of property, and the question is, whether this evidence
of ownership is overcome by notice of an outstanding equitable
interest in the vessel. The affirmative rests with the party
charging notice, and the facts brought home to the knowledge
of the purchaser to charge him with notice must be taken
together, as the question is, what effect the evidence as a whole
should have produced on his mind. Nor should it be forgotten
that the persons who had advanced money to Vanderbilt had
advanced it for the building of a vessel in his name and as his
property.
The same observations are applicable to the testimony of
Butler, a witness, iho says, there appeared to be a question between the parties regarding the validity of the title to the boat;
that Vanderbilt and Vail assured the purchasers that, independent of being builders of the boat, they were duly authorized
by all the parties that might have any interest in her in California
to sell her on the best terms. This witness does not profess to
give the words of the parties, but only the substance of the conversation as he then recollected it.
The testimony of Spencer, who went to New York to become
steward on the Adelaide, to the 12th interrogatory, says, "I
understood from both Capt. Vanderbilt and Mr. Demming that
John Van Pelt was part owner of the Adelaide ;" and to the
15th, he answered, "they (Vanderbilt and Demming) both told
me that the Adelaide was built to go to California; Captain
Vanderbilt said they had entered into a combination out there,
and the Adelaide was not needed; that they had boats enough out
there to do all the business, and that this was the reason why
they sold the Adelaide."
Now, the fact that the boat was built for parties in California,
and that they had come to the conclusion she was not needed
there, and wished her sold, did not necessarily, detract from the
right or authority of Vanderbilt to sell, who was invested with
the legal title. If she was intended for sale, the presumption
would not be an unnatural one that he was thus invested for the
very purpose of a sale. As to the testimony of Spencer, that lie
"understood from both Vanderbilt and Demming that John Van

DECEMBER TERM, 1862.
Calais Steamboat Conpany vs. Van Pelt'sAdministrator.
Pelt was part owner of the Adelaide." This is hardly evidence in
a Court of Justice. It is the inference of the witness from conversation, instead of the conversation itsel. It is not the evidence
of a fact; a charge of peijury could not be predicated upon it if
false.
Wood, another witness relied on to prove notice, beside the
indefiniteness of his testimony, the conversation occurred nearly
four years after the transaction; after also litigation had sprung
up concerning the claim of the estate of Van Pelt. The suit in
question was then pending against the respondents, and was
naturally the subject of conversation and very easy of misap
prehension. This witness also seems to have been in frequent
communication with one of the parties in the Van Pelt interest.
As a spedimen of his testimony--"I asked Demming, I think,
how the boat came to be sold here, and I think, Demming or
Mayhew told me that a person by the name of Van Pelt owned
her, who died in California. I don't know that he said Van
Pelt owiled her, but that owing to Van Pelt's death she was sold
here."
This witness also says: "I understood from conversation I
had with Detining and Mayhew that they had knowledge of
the interest of Van Pelt or of that estate before the boat was
purchased." We need not repeat this is not evidence. This is
all the testimony on the question of notice that deserves any
comment. We have seen that Van Pelt in his lifetime, and his
legal representatives since his death, have studiously concealed
their interest in this vessel in the city of New York, and for
this purpose caused her to be constructed and finished in the
name of Vanderbilt.; and, after the appointment of another
agent, Vail, to take charge of her after completion, the interest
was still to be concealed in his name, thereby holding out a
third person as the ostensible owner from the beginning of her
construction, till the sale took place in August, 1854. And,
although we do not say these parties who have thus enabled
their agents to impose upon the purchaser should be estopped
from setting up their interest as against -him, if he purchases
with knowlvdge, yet we think, under such circumstances, it is

SUPREME COURT.
Calais Steamboat Company vs. Van Pelt's Administrator.
the duty of the Court to scrutinize the evidence with more than
ordinary attention-the proof of knowledge should be direct
and unequivocal. The parties here seeking to prove the knowledge assume a position in contradiction to their past conduct,
and are not entitled to the most favorable consideration of the
Court. They are endeavoring to charge knowledge of a fact
upon third persons or the public, when their interests become
concerned, which they had down to the sale industriously concealed.
Some observations have been made upon the circumstances
under which the vessel left the port of New York for the East.
as tending to imp6ach the good faith of the purchasers. The
proofs on this subject leave no such impression on the mind of
the Court. The vessel had been purchased to fill a vacancy on
a line of steamboats, and a delay of some ten days had occurre
beyond the time fixed for her completion, which reasonably explains any impatience on the part of the purchasers "n leaving
for the city of Boston. Certainly, the fear of arrest can hardly
be inferred from their anxiety, as the vessel was equally exposed
to one in the latter city as in the former.
Without pursuing the case further we are satisfied that, upon
a full examination of the proofs on the question of notice, they
fail to impeach the bona fides of the purchasers, and as the legal
title passed, the complainant has failed to establish any right to
relief; and, we may add, we are not sorry that we have come to
a conclusion in favor of the innocent party who has acted upon
the evidene of the legal title of the party from whom the purchase -was made against the other innocent party, who had not
only been instrumental in furnishing this evidence but has industriously concealed his own, and thus turned the equity of
the case against him.
The decree below reversed.

steamboat described in the bill of complaint, as administrator of
John Van Pelt, late of San Francisco, in the State of California,
deceased. He was the complainant in the Court below, and his
claim is based, in the bill of complaint, upon the ground that the
money to build thirteen-twentieths of the steamer was furnished
by his intestate in his lifetime, or was paid out of his estate since
his decease, to redeem certain personal property belonging to the
estate which had been pledged by the decedent while in full life
to furnish credits to construct and complete the steamer. Title to
the whole steamer is claimed by th. respondents in their answer
by virtue of a purchase made by their agent on th A9th day of
September,'1854, of one William W. Vanderbilt. John Van
Pelt, on the 1st day of May, 1853, employed William W. Vanderbilt to make a draft for a steamer which he proposed to build
in the City of New York, to be employed in navigating the
waters of California. Vanderbilt made the draft as requested,
and Van Pelt about. the same time proposed to him that he
should proceed to the City of New York -as his agent, and there
contract for and superintend the building of the steamer. Prior
to that time he had been in the employment of Van Pelt as an
engineer in navigating steamers on the waters of the for'met
State. Connected as Van Pelt was, with such navigation, he
did not desire that it should be publicly known that he was
about to build a steamer of the description mentioned to come
to California; consequently, it was arranged between him and
his agent that the latter should immediately proceed to the City
of New York and make the contracts for the contemplated
steamer in his own name, and Vanderbilt testifies that he was
to enter the steamer, when completed, at the Custom-house in
New York as his vessel, unless he was otherwise ordered by
his employer. According to the arraugment as then made the
steamer, when completed, was to be sent to California and there
wholly transferred to the principal, unless the agent should
decide to become interested in her to the extent of two-twentieth parts as it was then contemplated he might do. Full proof
is exhibited that Van Pelt advanced $20,000 to his agent towards
the euterprize before any of the contracts were actually made

SUPREME COURT.

for the building of the steamer; $12,000 of that sum waa
advanced in the month of May, 1853, before the agent sailed for
New York, and the balance was duly forwarded to the agent
and received by him before any of the payments fell due under
the construction contracts. On the 7th day of July, 1853, the
agent made the contract with Lupton and MeiDiarmid to build
the hull of the steamer for the sum of $20,000; $5,000 were
to be paid when the .keel was laid, $5,000 when the vessel
was in frame, $5,000 when she was planked and her deck laid,
$2,500 when she was launched, and the balance of $2,500 when
the carpenter-work was finished. Separate and wholly independent contracts with other parties were made by the agent for
the engine, joiner-work, and painting. Payments under all the
contracts were to be made by instalments "as the work progressed," and in all, except the one first mentioned, it was
expressly stipulated that the work should be done to the satisfaction of Vanderbilt. Van Pelt wrote to him on the 1st day of
September, 1853, directing that the steamer, when completed,
should be registered as follows, to wit: ten-twentieths in the
name of D. P. Vail, four-twentieths in the name of Richard
Ohenery, three-twentieths in the name of R. M. Jessup, twotwentieths in the name of William W. Vanderbilt, and onetwentieth in the name of Frank Johnson. Other correspondence
took place between these parties which shows to a demonstration that Vanderbilt was merely the agent of Van Pelt' in contracting for the building of the steamer, and that the original
instructions in respect to the registry of the steamer were wholly
superseded. When the enterprize was projected Van Pelt had
expected to visit New York before the steamer was completed,
)ut his health failing in September, 1853, he was obliged to abandun that intention, and for that and other reasons determined to
make some new arrangement in respect to the steamer. Having
come to that determination, he sent for Richard Chenery, who,
accordingly visited the decedent at Sonoma where he was then
sick, and they made an arrangement in respect to the subject.
matter of this controversy. Under that arrangement Chenery
for himself and R. M. Jessup, took seven-twe-itieths of the

steamer, and it was, agreed that he should have the entire con
trol of the business. Pursuant to that arrangement Chenery
paid to Van Pelt seven-twentieths of the $20,000 which the
latter had already advanced to build the steaner, and by pledging property they procured a letter of credit on Page; Bacon &
Company for an additional sum of $50,000, to be expended in
her completion. They also appointed D. P. Vail as their agent,
and sent him to New York to adjust and pay the accounts and
close up the concerns growing out of the building of the steamer.
He took with him the letter of credit and proceeded to New
Y'ork, but on the 29th day of the same September John Vau
Pelt died.
Administration was granted on his estate in California in
October, 1853, and when closed, it appeared that there was
$70,000 for distribution among his heirs, exclusive of his interest
in the steamer now in controversy. Thirteen-twentieth parts of
the steamer were built from moneys advanced by John Van Pelt,
"orprocured from credits furnished by him
in his lifetime, as
fully appears by the accounts adjusted and paid by his administrators, and duly presented and allowed in the Probate Court.
$48,194.57 were paid by his administrators to redeem the property pledged to procure the before-mentioneI letter of credit,
and the whole amount so paid by them was expended in the
construction of the steamer. $13,000 had been advanced by
Van Pelt in his lifetime, as before explained, and the two sums
exceed thirteen-twentieths of the cost of the steamer by more
than a thousand dollars. Vail proceeded to New York, pursuant
to his appointment as agent of Van Pelt and Chenery, but as all
the contracts had been made in the name of Vanderbilt, he continued to superintend the completion of the steamer.
Contractors for the hull agreed to complete the same in four
months from the seventh day of July, 1853, and the evidence
shows that the hull was launched and delivered to Vanderbilt
in December following. She was built in Green Port, and after
being delivered, she was taken to New York, and in a few days
after her arrival there, the proper contractors commenced to put
in her engines. More than $56,000 were expended in her.eon

struction and equipment, in addition to the sum of $20,000 paid
to the builders of the hull. Builders of the hull were paid in
full according to the contract, and they delivered the same to
Vanderbilt in December, 1853, without reservation or condition.
1. Having received their pay in full, and delivered the vessel
withou reservation or condition, of course they retained no
interest which they could afterwards convey to any one. They
built the hull only, and never had any interest, title or claim, in
the entire vessel, or in the $56,000 expended for her completion
after such delivery. Where an entire vessel is agreed to be
built by a contractor, no property vests in the party for whom
she. is built until she is ready for delivery, and has been accepted
or approved by such party. Jfucklow vs. Mfangles, (1 Tauu.,
318); Striger vs. Munrray, (2 Barn. & Ald., 248); Aferrit vs. John

But that rule does not prevail where the vessel is constructed
ander the superintendence of the party for whom she is built, or
his agent, and payments for her, based upon the progress of the
work, are to be made by instalments, as the work is done. In
such cases the person for whom the vessel is built is regarded
as the real owner by all the well-considered decisions upon the.
subject. Woods vs. Russel, (5 Barn. & Ald., 442); Atkinson vs.

Vanderbilt

acquired no title by the delivery of the steamer, for the reason
that he furnished no money to pay the contractors, and in
accepting the same he acted as the agent of those whose money
was invested in the enterprise. He took no written conveyance
at that time, and the whole evidence shows that he did not then
contemplate any fraud upon the rights of those he represented
in accepting the delivery. Builders never had any title, beca use
the work had been performed under the superintendence of the
agent, and by the terms of the contract the consideration was to
be paid, and was in fact paid by instalments, as the work was
done.

3onceded, I think, that no title remained in the builders of tho
hull after the reception of the consideration, and the uncondi.
tional delivery of the steamer under the contract. Title, therefore; must have vested in those who furnished the means to
build the vessel, unless it be held that it was in abeyance, which
no one will assert. Assuming the facts to be so, then'it is clear
that the case falls within the rule that when an agent acquires
property in his own name by the use of the funds of his principal,
it thereby becomes the property of the principal by operation of
law. Scott vs. Surman, (Willes R., 400); TayZor vs. Plummei,

None will deny that title to a ship or vessel may.be acquired
by building or by purchase; and it is equally Iear that it may.
be established, especially when acquired in the 'former 'mod),
without the exhibition of any bill of sale or other written ei i.
deuce. Authorities in this country are abundant to show that
the title of a vessel may pass by delivery under a parol contract.

Attention to dates is important on this branch of the case, in
order to ascertain when and by what means,'if at all, Vanderbilt'
acquired what is called an apparent legal title. Importance

muot be attached to the inquiry as to dates, because the opinion
of the Court admits in effect that the title in fact, as between the
tespondents' grantor and the legal representatives of the deceased,
was in the estate of the decedent ; and it is difficult to see how
me admission could have, been withheld, as four months intervened after the builders surrendered All pretense of title before
any writing of any .kind was procured furnishing any color to
any such ground of defense. When it is said that Vanderbilt
had the apparent legal title, reference is made, I suppose, to the
bill of sale from the builders of the hull, to their certificate as
master carpenters, and to the enrollment of the steamer at the
custom-house. These several papers, it seems, are regarded as
constituting what is called an apparent legal title in Vanderbilt;
but if they do, it will be seen that they became such by a fraud
as base and transparent as was ever perpetrated by a living man
upon a dead man's estate. Bear in mind that Yanderbilt was
virtually superseded when the new agent was seit to New York
to settle the accounts and close the concerns. His subsequent
services were rendered as a sub-agent under David P. Vail; but,
whether so or not, his agency under his first appointment terminated on the 29th of September, 1853, when John Van Felt died.
Re then had no muniments of title, apparent or otherwise, and
the whole evidence shows that he never became the agent of the
heirs, or legal representatives of Van Pelt's estate. To make up
the supposed apparent legal title, his first step was to induce the
buildersof the hull to give him a bill of sale of the whole steamer.
What inducements were held out to them to give the bill of sale
does not appear; but it does appear that, on the 7th day of April,
1854-four months after they had delivered the hull without
veservation or condition-they gave him a bill of sale of the
whole steamer, in consideration of $20,OQO, as therein expressed
tuith covenants of general warranty applicable to the whole
interest and value of the steamer. They generously conveyed
not only what they built themselves, but all that was built by
oters, and warranted the whole to the grantee. Speaking of
the sale of a ship, Chancellor Kent says the general rule is that
no person can convey who. has no title, and the mere fact of

possession by the vendor is not of itself sufficient to give a title.
3 Kent Com., p. 130; Williams vs. Herle, (11 Wend., 80.) Observe that the hull was unconditionally delivered by the builders four months before the date of this bill of sale, and it is very
evident that after such delivery they retained no interest in the
hull or any part of the vessel which they could convey to any
one; and they never had any pretence of interest in the engine
or the other materials added to the steamer between the time of
the delivery ahd the date of their bill of sale. When that bill
of sale was given, no builder's certifiQate had been filed in"the
custom-house; but on the 22d day of May folowing, the build ers of the hull filed in the proper office a certificate in the usual
form, certifying that the steamer had been built by -them at
Green Port, in 1854, and that William W. Vahderbilt *as the.
owner. Such a certificate has the effect to show that the vessel
was built in the Unifed States, and that she is entitled to be
registered as such, and it is required to be filed before the vessel
can be registered or removed from the district where built to
the'district where the owner resides. Act Dec. 81, 1792, sec. 4,
1 Stat. at Large, 289.
4. Certificates given by master carpenters as a tompliance
with the registry acts are required for certain specified purposes,
but they are not instruments of conveyance and cannot properly
have the effect, or be so construed as *tovest any interest in the
person holding the same, as the owner of the vessel, beyond
what he has .by virtue of some other valid, legal title. Unless
these two instruments, taken in connection with the attending
circumstances, constituted a legal title in the grantor of the
respondents, then it is clear that he had none such, because they
are all the muniments of title held by him on the 3d day of
August, 1854, when he contracted to sell the steamer to Win.
Deming and Win. Todd, the agents of the respondents who made
the purchase. Conveyance of the steamer, however, was not
made by hYm until the 9th day of September following, and on
that day she was enrolled at the Custom-house in his name.
Doubts had arisen in regard to her title, and the purchasers and
seiier respectively employed counsel to make the title iatisfac.

tory at the custom-house, which resulted in procuring an enrollment Saturday evening just before the custom-house was closed.
Written notice in behalf of the legal representatives of John
Van Pelt was given to the Collector of New York on the 22d day of June, 1854, informig him that Van Pelt at his death was
the owner of thirteen-twentieths of the steamer, and requesting
that she might not be registered or enrolled, or any transfer of
her entered at the custom-house without notice to them, but it
does not affirmatively appear that the agents of the respondents
had any kinowledge of that paper. Registry acts are to be con
sidered as forms of local or municipal institutions for purposes
of public policy. They are imperative only upon voluntary
-transfers of the parties, and do not in general apply to transfers
by act or operation of the law. 3 Kent. Com., 9th ed., 208. Of
itself, the registry it is said is not evidence of property unlese
it be confirmed by some auxiliary circum~tances.to show that 41
was made by the authority of the person named in it, who iI
sought to be charged as owner. Without such proof, Courts o
Justice have expressed strong doubts whether it was even priml
facie evidence of ownership. U. S. vs. Brune, (2 Wall, jr,
p. 264); Tinkler vs. Walpole, (14 East, 226) ; .Mlver vs. Humble
(16 East, 169); Fraser vs. Hopkins, (2 Taunt., 5); Sharp vs.
United Ins. Co., (14 Johns., 381); 1 Greenl. Ev., p. 494. Upon
the same ground and for the same reasons it is competent for
the real owner who claims as builder to show by parol evidence
that his claim is well founded, and that the builder's certificate
and registry or enrollment were fraudulently.made and issued
in the name of another. Such fraudulent acts cannot convey
any interest in the vessel, and if not then a claimant whose title
has no other fQundation cannot convey a good title as against
the real owner even to a purchaser without notice, because he
cannot convey a title to that which he does not own. Williams
vs. Aerle, (11 Wend., 80); Everett vs. Coffn, (6 Wend., 609);

5.- But suppose it~to be otherwise, and that the legal title to
the steamer was in Vanderbilt at the time he and Vail gave the
bill of sale to the agent of the respondent, still the complainant

as it seems to me, is entitled to recoVer in thio suit on the ground
that Vanderbilt held the title in trust for the legal representa.
tives of John Van Pelt, and that the agents of the respondent had
notice of the defect of title in their grantor. It is admitted that
as between the legal representative of Van Pelt and the grantor
of the respondents, the title to the steamer was in the former, so
that the only question on this branch of the case is that of
notice, but it is said that direct and unequivocal proof of notice
must be required. Nothing is better settled than the rule that
a purchaser with notice, of a trust stands in no better situation
than the seller, and it is equally well settled that notice to the
agent is notice to the principal. Com. Dig. Chan. 4, c. 5; -addox vs. Maddox, (1 Ves., Jr., p. 62); Fulton Bank v. New York
and Sharon Canal Co., (4 Paige Ch.R., 127)'; Bank of Alex.
vs. Seton, (1 Pet., 309). Purchasers with notice are bound in all
respects as their vendors were, and have no greater right. Tay.
lor vs. Sibbett, (2 Yes., Jr., p. 437).
6. Until a different rule is established by this Court, I must
continue to hold that whatever puts a party upon further inquiry
iisufficient notice in equity. Ordinary prudence is required of
t Le purchaser in respect to the title of the seller, and if he fails
bt investigate when put upon inquiry, he is chargeable with all
the knowledge it is reasonable to suppose he would have
acquired if he had performed his duty. Hill vs. Simpson, (7
Ves., Jr., 170); Eennedy vs. Green, (3 My. & Keen, 722); (Com.
Dig., Chancery, 4, c. 2; Smith vs. Lowe, (1 Atk., 489, 3 Sug. on
V. & P., 10th ed., 471); Jones vs. Smith, (1 Hare, 43); Booth vs.
Barnum, (9 Conn., 286); Pitney vs. Leonard, (1 Paige, Ch.R.,
461); Carr vs. Hilton, (1 Cur., C. C., 390). Constructive notice
is held sufficient, upon the ground that when a party is about to
perform an act by which" he has reason to believe that the rights
of a third person may be effected, an inquiry as to the facts is a
moral duty, and diligence an act of justice. Hence, says Judge
Duer,,in Piringle vs. Phillips,(5 Sand., S. C. R.,,157); he proceeds at his peril when he omits to inquire, and is then charge.able with a knowledge of all the facts that by a proper inquiry

he might have- ascertained. Hawley vs. Cramer, (4 Cow., 717);
Williamson vs. Brown, (20 Law R., 397).
7. Applying these principles to the present case, I am of the
opinion that the evidence to show notice is full and complete
establishing the fact beyond all reasonable doubt. Respondent's
agents, Deming and Todd, were examined as witnesses, and they
deny that they heard that any parties in California other than
their grantor had any right or interest in the steamer, but the
fact is proved to have been otherwise by six or seven witnesses,
whose depositions are in the record. Their grantor, Vanderbilt
was examined as a witness, and the respondents asked him
whether in the negotiations and interviews he represented him
self as adting for any other person than. himself, and he stated
expressly that he represented himself as acting for himself,
David P. Vail, "and the other owners." Responding to anothei
interrogatory of a similar character, he said that, he represented
himself as acting for himself and parties in California who had
advanced him money to build the boat, and as if to make it
more emphatic and precise, he also said that he did state that
parties in California had advanced him money to build the
steamer Adelaide; and what is still more important, he also said
that he so stated on board the Adelaide some time in August,
1854, and that they, the California parties, wanted the Adelaide
soldl-to realize their money, as he had no other means of paying
them. Communications so direct and specifie could not have
been misunderstood, and the occasion last referred to undeubtedly was the one when the respondent's agents went on
board the steamer to examine her on the day the contract of
sale was made. When the last interview took place Vail was
out of town, but Vanderbilt says he informed the respondents'
agents that Vail represented some parties in California who had
advanced money. Some delay occurred in consequence of his
absence,, but he was sent for and joined in the contract; and
Vanderbilt says that he represented to them the position he
occupied; that he represented that he wos acting as the agent of
parties in California who' had advanced money for the vessel;
and in conclusion, the witness says: "I always told them there

891

were parties in California who had, advanced money for the
steamer, ut I have no recollection of telling them the names of
the parties."
Vail was also examined as a wituess by the respondents. He
says it was mentioned at the time that he represented owners in
California, and that he consented to the sale by.authority of
instructions from Mr. Chenery to that effect. Deming and Todd,
as the witness stated, understood from Vanderbilt and himself
that the vessel was built for parties in California, and that the
reason she was sold was because the business had changed there,
so that the boat was not wanted., We told Mr. Deming, says the
witiness, that we were acting for parties in California, who wished
the boat sold; and we did state that the Adelaide was built foyI
parties in California. Both of these witnesses were examined:
by the respondents, and it is safe to say-there is nc ground
to suspect them of any partiality for the complainant. Other
witnesses were also examined upon the subject, on the one side
or the'other, whose testimony is equally explicit. Complainant
examiined Carlos P..Butler, who wrote the original agreement.
He says that there appeared to be a question between the purchasers and the sellers in regard to the validity of the title to the
boat. Sellers assured'purchasers that, independently of being
builders of the boat, they were duly authorized by any party oT
parties that might have an interest in her in California; to dispose
of her on the best possible terms. Want of confidence was
evidently felt and mannested in what is now denominated the
apparent legal title. Assurances were given that the persons
proposing to sell had authority to sell from the real owners.; but
they exhibited no power of attorney to repredent absent owners,
or to sell the interest of the complainant's intestate, and no
ifiquiries were made upon the subject. Wittiess says doubts
were expressed as to the power of Vail and Vanderbilt to convey
a good title, but Mr. Deming said he was perfectly satisfied withi
Their statemhent. Their statement was, that they had authority
independently of being builders of the boat; but no such
authority was exhibited and no inquiries made in regard to it

.

although the witness states that it was spoken of by all that the
steamer was built for parties in California.
Answer of respondent denies all such information, but the
evidence proves it and falsifies the answer. Defence must rest
where it is placed in the pleadings, and cannot now be shifted.
Another witness, examined by the complainant, was John W.
Marshall, who testifies that while Deming and Vanderbilt were
negotiating on board the steamer, the latter said he wanted to
see Captain Vail before he could do anything about selling the
steamer, as he (Vail) had power to sell the boat; and the witness
adds: Deming knew she was built for parties in California, as
we talked about it before we came on. Reference should alsc
be made in this connection to the deposition of John Spencer,
who testifies that Vanderbilt and Deming both told him that the
.Adelaide was built to go to California to run on the Sacramento
jiver; and he expressly states that he understood from both of
Ihem that John Van Pelt was a part owner in the Adelaide.
Certain conversations between Deming and James Wood, who
was examined as a witness, are- also given in evidence by the
o)mplainant, to the effect that the former stated to the latter, in
May, 1858, that the boat was built for parties in California; and
the witness thinks that Deming, or the party who introduced
him, stated that a person by the name of John Van Pelt, who
died in California, owned the steamer. Complainant also refers
to the conduct of Deming after the steamer was enrolled at the
mstom-house as tending to confirm the testimony, offered to
show that he had knowledge that the title was defective, and,
unless the ordinary rules of evidence are to be wholly disregarded, the circumstances proved are entitled to great considaration. Efforts to make the title satisfactory were not
successful until Saturday evening, just before the time of closing
the. custom-house. While the negotiations for perfecting the
title were going on, and only the day before they were closed,
an agent of the heirs of John Van Pelt's estate arrived in the
city of New York from California to look after this vessel. On
his arrival he heard of the sale of the steamer, but having ascer
tained that she still remained at the wharf, and that she had not

893

been enrolled or inspected, he applied to the surrogate for
administration on the estate. All this took place on Saturday;
and that evening, after dark, Mr. Deming sent for Mr. Winchester,
who had come on to take charge of the steamer as master, and
directed him to have the smoke-pipe of the steamer painted that
night, signifying at the same time that the steamer would sail
on the following morning.
After his arrival in the city of New York, Winchester had
acted as master of the steamer, but on Sunday morning William
W. Vanderbilt took charge of her as master, and between seven
and eight o'clock she sailed for Boston in a storm, when it blew
so hard that she hid to come to anchor at the mouth of the
sound. Whether Deming knew the person who had arrived
from California as the agent of the heirs does not appear, but it
does appear that he was well known to the sellers of the steamer,
and the circumstances afford strong ground to infer that the
departure of the steamer was hastened as a means of discourag
ig further attempts to prosecute the claim. Taken as a whole,
I am of the opinion that the evidence shows that the agents of .
the respondents had actual notice that the title of the sellers of
the steamer was defective, and that she was built by monies
alvanced by parties'in California; but at all events I am of the
opinion that they had constructive notice that their grantors
were not authorized to make the sale, and it is incomprehensible
to me how any one who will read the record can come to a
different concltision.
Decree of the Circuit Court, I think, should be affirmed.
Mr. Justice MILLER: I am of opinion that ten-twentieths
of the steamboat Adelaide were owed by John Van Pelt in his
lifetime, and that the legal title passed to his administrators in
California.
That i-o sale of. that interest could be made by those adminis.
trators, by the law of California, without an order of Court, and
as no such order was made, there was no valid sale of that
'aterest to defendants.
I have not been able to find anything in the case to take the

transaotion between defendants and Vanderbilt out of rule of
caveat ei ptor I am of opinion, therefore, that the decree of the
Circuit Court should be affirmed;except as to twg-twentieths,
which I think were the property of Vanderbilt, and one-twentieth
the property of Frank Johnson, which, with the other seven
twentaeths held by Chenery, passed to defendants by Vanderbilt's

UNITED STATES vs. GALBRAITH ET AL.
A. In a California land case, the production of a fraudulent and
false certificate of approval signed by the Governor and
Secretary who signed the grant, and proved by the same
witnesses in the same way that the grant was proved, affords
(in the absence of explanatory evidence,) strong ground for
believing all the title papers to be fabricated.
. Where the date of a grant has been altered, while it was in the
hands of the claimants and is produced to the Court without
evidence, to show how the alteration came to be made, this
Court cannot confirm the title.
. The case of U. S. vs. West's Heirs reviewed, the facts stated
from the original record, and all its features shown to be
strikingly different from this case.

time of its date.
This was a land claim originating before the Cominsion

the Northern District of California.
