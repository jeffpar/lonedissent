COlMISSIONERS.

LAmtonN v. COUNTY CO~iiaSSIONERS.
A contract for the purchase by A. from B. of certain lands in Kansas providiel
that A. should pay all taxes lawfully assessed on them, and that B. woull
convey them upon the payment of the purchase-money. The taxes assessed
for the year 1870, held by the Supreme Court of the State to be valid, not
having been paid, the county treasurer advertised, and, in May, 1871, sold the
lands therefor, the county bidding them in. In 1872, C., trustee and representative of A., relying upon the validity of the tax, paid without protest
into the county treasury, out of moneys belonging to A., a sum sufficient
to redeem the lands so sold, and received the tax certificate therefor, which
he took in his own name. He also paid a portion of the taxes for 1871 and
1872. The statute provides that, on the non-redemption of lands within three
years from the day of the sale thereof for taxes, the treasurer may, on the
presentation of the certificate, execute a deed to the purchaser, or refund
the amount paid therefor, if he discovers that, by reason of error or irregularity, the lands ought not to be conveyed. This court having decided that
the lands were not taxable, C., in 1874, offered to return the tax certificate
to the county treasurer, and demanded that the moneys paid by him be
refunded. That demand having been refused, he brought this action to
recover them. Held, 1. That C. cannot be regarded as a purchaser of the
lands. 2. That the payments by him so made, there having been neither
fraud, mistake of fact, nor duress, were voluntary, in such a sense as to
defeat the action. 3. That the statute of Kansas, as construed by the Supreme Court of that State, does not, upon the facts of the case, entitle him
to recover.

ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Kansas.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. C.-E. Bretherton for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. 8. 0. Thacher, contra.
M . JUSTIcE BRADLE delivered the opinion of the court.
Lamborn, the plaintiff in error in this case, is the trustee and
representative of the National Land Company. This company
had contracted with the Kansas Pacific Railway Company for
the purchase of a large quantity of the lands in Kansas, to
which the latter company was entitled under the congressional
grant made to it, under the name of the Leavenworth, Pawnee,

and Western Railroad Company, and the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Eastern Division, by the acts of July 1, 1862,
and July 2, 1864. The contract required the land company to

pay all such taxes and assessments as might be lawfully imposed on the lands. And it provided that the railway company
should. at the request of the land company, convey by deed of
general warranty any of the lands purchased, -whenever the purchase-money and interest and the iiecessary stamps should be
furnished by the latter. The land company, after acquiring this
contract, had contracted to sell large portions of the lands to
third parties, taking from them agreements to pay all taxes
and assessments that might be imposed upon the lands sold
to them respectively. The lands in Dickinson County were
assessed by the defendants for taxes for the years 1870, 1871,
and 1872 successively, when, as yet, they were not taxable,
no patent having been issued therefor, and the costs of surveying, selecting, and conveying the same not having been paid.
These taxes, therefore, as decided by us in the case of Railway
Company v. Prescott (16 Wall. 603), were not legal. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of Kansas, in that case, had held
such taxes legal; and the taxes for the year 1870, now in question, not having been paid, the treasurer of Dickinson County
proceeded to advertise and sell the lands therefor in May,
1871, and, no person bidding the requisite amount, the lands
were bid in for the county. The assessments for 1871 and
1872 were made against the lands whilst they were in this
position.
By the laws of Kansas, if lands sold for taxes are bid in for
the county, the county treasurer is authorized to issue a tax
certificate to any person who shall pay into the county treasury
an amount equal to the cost of redemption at the time of payment. Gen. Stat. of Kansas, c. 107, sect. 91. And if any lands
sold for taxes are not redeemed within three years from the day
of sale, the clerk of the county may execute a deed to the purchaser, his heirs or assigns, on the presentation to him of the
certificate of sale. Sect. 112. It is further provided, that if the
county treasurer shall discover, before the sale of any lands for
taxes, that on account of any irregular assessment, or from any
other error, such lands ought not to be sold, he shall not offer
such lands for sale; and if, after any certificate shall have been
granted upon such sale, the county clerk shall discover that,
for any error or irregularity, such land ought not to be con-

veyed, he shall not convey the same; and the county treasurer
shall, on the return of the tax certificate, refund the amount
paid therefor on such sale, and all subsequent taxes and charges
paid thereon by the purchaser or his assigns, out of the county
treasury, with interest on the whole amount at the rate of ten
per cent per annum. Sect. 120.
In 1872, the plaintiff in error paid into the county treasury
the sums due for taxes, interest, &c., on the said lands in Dickinson County, which had been sold for taxes as aforesaid, and
received tax certificates therefor, without making any protest,
not being aware at that time, as he alleges, that the lands were
exempt from taxation, but supposing that the taxes were legal
and valid. On the second day of January, 1874, after the
decision of this court in Railway Company v. Prescott (supra),
he offered to return the tax certificates to the county treasurer, and demanded a return of the money paid by him into
the county treasury, with interest, which was refused by the
treasurer; and thereupon this suit, against the board of county
commissioners of that county, was brought to recover the
same.
Under this state of facts the judges of the Circuit Court
differed in opinion on the following points of law: 1. Whether judgment should be rendered for the plaintiff or
for the defendant.
2. Whether the acquisition of said tax certificates and the
subsequent payment of taxes by the plaintiff was a voluntary
payment of the money now sought to be recovered back in such
a sense as to defeat the right to such recovery.
3. Whether the statute of Kansas (Gen. Stat., p. 1058, sects.
120, 121) gives the right upon the facts above found to the
plaintiff to recover in respect of the causes of action set out in
the petition.
Judgment was given in favor of the defendant, in accordance
with the opinion of the presiding judge, and Lamborn sued out
this wit of error.
The plaintiff insists that he is to be regarded as a purchaser,
and entitled under the statute referred to, or, if not under that
statute, then on general principles of law, to a return of the
money paid by him to the county treasurer.

[Sup. Ct.

But we are of opinion that the plaintiff cannot be regarded
as a purchaser of the lands. The moneys were paid by him
on behalf of the National Land Company, under the belief that
the taxes were legal and valid; and it is not only apparent
from the facts found that he made the payment in 1872 by
way of redeeming the lands, but, if it did not so expressly
appear, it ought to be presumed that he paid the money for
that purpose. As between the land company and the Kansas
Pacific Railway Company (which had not yet been paid for
the lands), it was the duty of the former to pay all legal taxes
and assessments imposed thereon. The plaintiff, as agent of
the land company, could not acquire a tax title without being
guilty of bad faith to the railway company. Taxes on lands
in Kansas are assessed against the lands themselves, and a tax
sale (when valid) confers an absolute title. Such a sale, bad
it been valid in this case, would have given the land company
a full and valid title adverse to that of the railway company,
and would have defeated their lien upon the same for the
purchase-money. The cases on this subject are very full and
explicit, and are based on considerations of equity and justice.
Judge Cooley says: "There is a general principle applicable
to such cases, that a purchase made by one whose duty it
was to pay the taxes shall operate as payment only: he shall
acquire no rights, as against a third party, by a neglect of
the duty which he owed to such party. This principle is universal, and is so entirely reasonable as scarcely to need the
support of authority. Show the existence of the duty, and
the disqualification is made out in every instance." And he
instances the cases of lessees and mortgagors as obviously
within the disability. Cooley, Taxation, 846. In Blackwell
on Tax Titles, 401, it is said: "A vendee cannot acquire a
title adverse to his vendor by the purchase of the land at
a tax sale, nor can an agent whose duty it is to pay the
taxes become the purchaser of the principal's land at such a
sale." This doctrine has been fully adopted by the Supreme
Court of Kansas. Cdrithers v. Weaver, 7 Kan. 110; Hurtz v.
Fisher, 8 id. 90.
The next question to consider, therefore, is whether money
thus paid by way of redemption can be recovered back. There

are only three grounds on which such a recovery can be maintained,- fraud, mistake, or duress.
No fraud is charged.
Mistake, in order to be a ground of recovery, must be a mistake of fact, and not of law. Such, at least, is the general rule.
3 Pars. Contr. 398; Hunt v. _Rousmaniere, 1 Pet. 1; Bilbie v.
Lumley, 2 East, 183; 2 Smith, Lead. Cas. 398 (6th ed. 458),
notes to HLfarriot v. Hampton. A voluntary payment, made
with a full knowledge of all the facts and circumstances of
the case, though made under a mistaken view of the law,
cannot be revoked, and the money so paid cannot be recovered back. Clarke v. Dutcher, 9 Cow. (N. Y.) 674; Ege v.
Koontz, 8 Pa. St. 109; Boston & Sandwich alass Co. v. City
of Boston, 4 Metc. (Mass.) 181; Benson & Another v. Honroe,
7 Cush. (Mass.) 125; Xilnes v. -Duncan,6 Barn. & Cress. 671;
Stewart v. Stewart, 6 C1. & Fin. 911; and see cases cited in
note to 2 Smith, Lead. Cas. 403, 404 (6th ed. 466), M11arriot v.
Hampton.
In the present case, there is no dispute that all the facts
and circumstances of the case, bearing on the question of the
legality of the tax, were fully known to the plaintiff. He
professedly relied on the law, as declared by the Supreme
Court of Kansas, and supposed that the tax was legal and
valid.
The only other ground left, therefore, on which a right to
recover back the money paid can be at all based, is, that the
payment was not voluntary, but by compulsion, or duress. It is
contended that the plaintiff was obliged to pay the taxes in order
to remove the cloud from the title which had been raised by
the tax sale, and to prevent a deed from being given to some
third party after the expiration of the three years allowed for
redemption.
It is settled by many authorities that mouey paid by a person to prevent an illegal seizure of his person or property by
an officer claiming authority to seize the same, or to liberate his
person or property from illegal detention by such officer, may
be recovered back in an action for money had and received, on
the ground that the payment was compulsory, or by duress or
extortion. Under this rule, illegal taxes or other public exac-

[Sup. Ct.

tions, paid to prevent such seizure or remove such detention,
may be recovered back, unless prohibited by some statutor)
regulation to the contrary. Elliott v. Swartwurt, 10 Pet. 137;
Bipley v. Gelston, 9 Johns. (N. Y.) 201; Clinton v. Strong,
id. 369; and cases cited in 2 Smith, Lead. Cas. (6th ed.) 468;
Cooley, Taxation, 568.
But it has been questioned whether a sale or threatened sale
of land for an illegal tax is within this rule, there being no
seizure of the property, and nothing supervening upon the sale
except a cloud on the title. This view has been adopted in
Kansas. In Phillips v. Jefferson County (5 Kan. 412), certain
Indian lands, not legally taxable, were nevertheless assessed
and sold for taxes, and a certificate issued to the purchaser.
Phillips, having acquired title to the land, paid the amount of
said taxes, at the same time denying their legality, and saying
that he paid the money to prevent tax-deeds from issuing on the
certificates. The court hold that the payment was purely voluntary, and add: "The money was not paid on compulsion or
extorted as a condition. A tax-deed had been due for nearly
two years. Had the plaintiff desired to litigate the question,
he could have done so without paying the money; even had a
deed been made out on the tax certificate, it would have been
set aside by appropriate proceedings. There was no legal
ground for apprehending any danger on the part of the plaintiff.
He could have litigated the case as well before as after payment.
Neither his person nor property was menaced by legal process.
Regarding, then, the payment as purely voluntary, it is as certain as any principle of law can be that it could not be recovered
back."
It seems to us that this case is precisely parallel with the one
before us. We are unable to perceive any distinction between
them. And as it is the law of Kansas which we are called
upon to administer, the settled decisions of its Supreme Court,
upon the very matter, are entitled to the highest respect. We
are not aware of any decision which tends to shake the authority
of Phillips v. Jefferson County. On the contrary, the same
views have been subsequently reiterated. In Jabaunsee
County v. Walker (8 id. 431), a case precisely like it, with the
exception that when the taxes were paid to the county collector

to redeem the tax certificates, under a mistaken view of the
law, he charged twice as much interest as he was entitled to,
the party paid under protest. Yet it was held that be could
not recover back even the illegal interest. The court relied on
the previous decision in Pllipsv. Jefferson County, and, after
examining various other authorities, summed up the matter as
follows: "A correct statement of the rule governing such
cases as this would probably be as follows: Where a party pays
an illegal demand with a full knowledge of all the facts which
render such demand illegal, without an immediate and urgent
necessity therefor, or unless to release his person or property
from detention, or to prevent an immediate seizure of his person
or property, such payment must be deemed to be voluntary, and
cannot be recovered back. And the fact that the party, at the
time of making the payment, files a written protest does not
make the payment involuntary."
The question was again discussed in the recent case of the
Kansas Pacific Railway Co. v. Commissioners of Tyandotte
County (16 id. 587); and although, in that case, a personal tax
paid by the railroad company under protest was recovered back,
such recovery was allowed on the ground that, if the tax was not
paid, it would be the immediate duty of the county treasurer to
issue a warrant to the sheriff to levy upon and sell the personal
property of the company therefor. But the principles of the
former cases were recognized and affirmed.
It has undoubtedly been held in other States (though perhaps
not directly adjudged) that a payment of illegal taxes on lands,
to avoid or remove a cloud upon the title arising from a tax
sale, is a compulsory payment. The case of Stephan v. -Daniels
et al. (27 Ohio St. 527) is of this character; though in that
case the plaintiff relied on the provisions of a local statute;
and besides this, a legal tax was combined with an illegal
assessment, and perhaps a sale would have conferred a valid
title upon the purchaser. Where such would be the effect of a
tax sale, we cannot doubt that a payment of the tax, made to
prevent it, should be regarded as compulsory and not voluntary.
The threatened divestiture of a man's title to land is certainly
as stringent a duress as the threatened seizure of his goods;
and if imminent, and he has no other adequate remedy to pre.

[Sup. Ct.

vent it, justice requires that he should be permitted to pay the
tax, and test its legality by an action to recover back the money.
But as, in general, an illegal tax cannot furnish the basis of a
legal sale, the case supposed cannot often arise. If the legality
of the tax is merely doubtful, and the validity of the sale would
depend on its legality, according to the law of Kansas, the
party, if he chooses to waive the other remedies given him by
law to test the validity of the tax, must take his risk either
voluntarily to pay the tax, and thus avoid the question, or to
let his land be sold, at the hazard of losing it if the tax should
be sustained. Having a knowledge of all the facts, it is held
that he must be presumed to know the law; and, in the absence
of any fraud or better knowledge on the part of the officer
receiiing payment, he cannot recover back money paid under
such mistake.
In conclusion, our judgment is that the questions submitted
by the Circuit Court must be answered as follows : To the first: that judgment should be rendered for the
defendant.
To the second: that the acquisition of the tax certificates
and the subsequent payment of the taxes by the plaintiff were
a voluntary payment, in such a sense as to defeat the right to
recover in this action.
To the third: that the statute of Kansas, referred to in the
question, does not, upon the facts found, give to the plaintiff
the right to recover in respect of the causes of action set out in
the opinion.
Judgment affirmed.
