TRUST CO]3PANY V. SEDGWICK.
The court adheres to its ruling in Phippsv. Sedqwiclk (95 U. S. 3), that, where a hus.
band causes real estate to be conveyed to his wife in fraud of his creditors, a
judgment in personam for its value cannot be taken, at the suit of his assignee
in bankruptcy, against her, nor, in case of her death, against her executors.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of New York.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr..-E. S. Van Winkle for the appellant.
Mr. P. NY.Bangs, contra.
MR. JUSTICE SwAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
Prior to the 1st of December, 1865, a copartnership existed
in the city of New York, under the name of J. K. & E. B. Place.
They were dealers in groceries. The members of the firm were
James K. Place, Ephraim B. Place, and James D. Sparkman.
The latter was a special partner. Under the law of New York,
such partners can put a limited sum at risk, and are liable for
nothing beyond it. At the date mentioned, this copartnership
was dissolved. E. B. Place retired, and a new firm was formed,
under the name of J. K. Place & Co. The members were
James D. Sparkman and James K. 'Place. By the terms of the
agreement, Sparkman was to contribute capital to the amount
of $200,000, and Place to the amount of $600,000, and the
profits were to be apportioned accordingly. After making due
allowance for the payment of all liabilities, the estimated
value of Sparkman's interest in the assets of the old firm was
$262,000, of James K. Place's $227,000, and of E. B. Place's
$168,000. The latter sum E. B. Place had a right to draw out
at any time, and he subsequently received the most of it. The
debts of the old firm at the time of the creation of the new one,
exclusive of the sum due E. B. Place, amounted to $3,850,000.
Adding what was to be paid to him, they exceeded $4,000,000.
A part of the assets of the old firm was merchandise on
hand, valued in gold at $996,000. To this was added, to
show its value in currency, forty-eight per cent, making an
aggregate of $1,474,000. There was also cash on hand, con-

sisting of balances in the banks with which the firm dealt, to
the amount of $137,000. The other assets were chiefly bills
receivable and accounts in favor of the firm. J. K. Place & Co.
put no new capital into their concern. They bought the merchandise of the former firm at $1,474,000, the amount at which
it was estimated in currency. This was nearly $1,000,000
in excess of the aggregate of the sum to which they severally
claimed to be entitled out of the assets of that firm. They
remained at its place of business, used its books, and applied
its means in all respects as if that firm still subsisted.
By a deed bearing date on the 30th of November, 1865, James
D. Sparkman assigned the leasehold premises here in question
to James K. Place. By a like deed, dated on the 1st of December following, Place assigned the same premises to Mary
A. Sparkman, the wife of James D. Sparkman. Both these
deeds were acknowledged on the 5th and recorded on the 9th
of the month last mentioned. The premises were the family
residence of Sparkman. At the time of this transaction he
settled upon his wife also the horses, carriages, and furniture
which formed a part of the establishment. He likewise directed
his counsel to prepare the proper instrument for settling upon
his wife 840,000 of seven per cent bonds of the United States,
which he had received as his proportion of a larger amount of
those securities belonging to the old firm. He afterwards
claimed that this settlement had been made. In one of his
answers to the bill in this case he said: "That being about
to embark as a general partner in the said firm of James K.
Place & Co., and being well advanced in years, he was desirous
of making, in favor of his wife, Mary A. Sparkman, since deceased, a settlement of a portion of his property; and on or
about the first day of December, 1865, having paid in his proportion of the capital to be contributed by him to the firm of
James K. Place & Co., he directed his counsel to take the
proper steps to secure to his said wife, from his then existing
remaining property, the sum of one hundred thousand dollars
($100,000), or thereabouts."
What was done touching the property mentioned was the
intended realization of this plan. It is not questioned that the
several items were worth the amount proposed to be settled.

TRUST CO. V. SEDGWICK.

[Sup. at.

Mary Ann Sparkman died on the 13th of October, 1866. By
her will, which bore date on the 20th of July of that year, she
gave the income of her estate to her husband, James D. Sparkman, for life, and after his death, the estate to his children. She
had no children.
After her death, the leasehold premises were sold and conveyed by her executor to John Q. Preble. He paid $18,196.60
in cash, and gave his bond and mortgage for $40,000, being the
balance of the purchase-money.
On the 27th of December, 1867, J. K. Place & Co. failed,
and made an assignment to Burrit and Sheffield, for the benefit
of their creditors. Subsequently, both the partners, Place and
Sparkman, went into voluntary bankruptcy, and Sedgwick, the
complainant, became their assignee under the bankrupt law.
He filed this bill in the District Court to reach the $40,000 of
government bonds and the proceeds of the leasehold premises,
and to subject them to his administration. That court decreed
in his favor with respect to the bonds, but dismissed the bill as
to the real estate. He thereupon appealed to the Circuit Court.
There the decree of the District Court was affirmed as to the
bonds and reversed as to the realty. The court decreed, among
other things, that the bond and mortgage of Preble should be
delivered to the complainant; that the amount due upon them
should be paid to him; and that the executor of Mary Ann
Sparkman should pay to the complainant, out of the assets of
her estate, the sum of $28,304.89.
This amount was made up of the cash payment received by
James T. Sparkman, while executor, from Preble, with interest
to the date of the decree, and interest paid to the executor by
Preble on his bond and mortgage, with interest upon that also
to the same period.
The executor thereupon removed the case to this court by
appeal.
The appeal was limited to the leasehold premises and the
money decree against the executor. None was taken with
respect to the bonds of the United States. That subject is not
therefore involved in the controversy as it is now before us.
Two questions are presented for our determination: 1. Was the settlement of the leasehold property valid?

Oct. 1877.]

TRUST CO. v. SEDGWICK.

2. If not, was the money decree against the executor properly rendered?
On the first point we entertain no doubt. The debts of the old
firm, as we have shown, were $3,852,000. The assets, as they
appeared on the books, were $4,509,000. The debts were a sum
certain, which grew constantly and largely by the accumulafion
of interest. How much less than their face the assets were worth
does not appear. They were liable to constant depreciation from
the failure and insolvency of those from whom they were due. A
sudden fall of prices would have produced the same effect as to
the merchandise. The cash on hand was less than three per
cent of the amount of the liabilities to be paid. The assets of
every kind, good and bad, exceeded the amount of the liabilities
to be paid by only two-ninths. He would have been a bold, if
not; a rash man, who would have agreed to take all the assets
and pay all the debts. No responsible person, we apprehend,
would have entered into such a stipulation without a large
premium in addition to the assets. The new company was
embarrassed from the beginning, and failed within a few days
over two years from the time it was formed. It was found to
be hopelessly insolvent. Its liabilities exceeded its means by
at least $600,000.
With these facts before us, we cannot hesitate to bold that
Sparkman was in no condition to settle any thing on his wife
when the new partnership was formed.
The turning-point in this class of cases is always whether
there was fraud in fact. The result depends upon the solution
of that question. When one engaged or about to engage in
any business has the means to meet its usual exigencies, and
devotes such means in good faith to the business, and has
besides other means which he chooses to settle upon any object
of his bounty, unlooked-for disasters on his part, subsequently
occurring, will not affect the validity of the settlement, because
they afford no ground for the imputation of unfairness. Bat
where there are heavy subsisting liabilities, doubtful solvency,
a large settlement made upon the wife at the outset of the
business, and failure and insolvency to a large amount shortly
follow, it is impossible to avoid the conviction that there was
a deliberate plan to provide for the settler and his family in

[Sup. Ct.

any event, and to throw the burden of the losses that might
occur upon his creditors. The intention animating such *conduct is condemned alike by ethics and the law. We think the
case before us falls within this category, and we are entirely
satisfied with the judgment of the Circuit Court upon the
subject.
But different considerations apply to the fund for which the
money part in the decree was rendered. The moneys were
received by the executor for property sold by him after the
death of the testatrix. It was lent by him to the firm of Place,
King, & Place, and was lost to the estate by their failure.
There is no proof that the testatrix took any part in bringing
about the settlement, or that there was any guilty, knowledge
on her part in the transaction. It is fairly to be presumed that
she confided in the good faith of her husband, and simply yielded
obedience to his wishes. The provision of her will attests her
devotion to him. The fund did not exist in her lifetime, and
her estate has been in no wise benefited by it. The transfer of
the property was his act, not hers. She was only a passive
recipient. Her will-doubtless influenced, if not controlled
by him -gave him her entire estate for life, and, after his
death, gave it to his family. No provision was made for her
family.
The sphere of the avocations and duties of husband and wife
are different. Usually she knows little of business and property
interests. It is natural that she should confide in his integrity,
and be guided in every thing by his kindly judgment. She is
always sub potestate viri. Hence, the disabilities and safeguards
which the law wisely throws around her.
Chancellor Kent says: "The husband is liable for the torts
and frauds of the wife committed during coverture. If committed in his company or by his order, he alone is liable."
2 Com. 149. "And if a wife act in company with her husband
in the commission of a felony, other than treason or homicide,
it is conclusively presumed that she acted under his coercion,
and is consequently without any guilty intent." I Greenl.

Afeme covert may be a trustee, but her husband is personally
liable for any breach of trust she may commit, and hence she
cannot act in the administration of the trust without his concurrence or consent. Hill, Trustees, 464; Phillips v. Bichardson, 4 J. J. Marsh. (Ky.) 212. She is not liable upon the
covenants of title in a deed executed by herself and her husband. Schouler, Dom. Rel. 155. Upon the subject of her disabilities, see Norton v. Header, 4 Sawyer, 603.
This part of the decree was clearly erroneous, and the error
must be corrected.
The cases of Phipps v. Sedgwick and of Place v. Sedgwick (95
U. S. 3) were branches of this litigation. They presented the
same questions of fact and law which we have considered in
this case. Those questions were disposed of as we have now
determined them. The fulness with which the -views of the
court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller, were expressed,
renders it unnecessary to add any thing to what has been
already said, on the present occasion.
This case will be remanded to the Circuit Court, with directions to modify the decree in conformity to this opinion; and

A ship in tow of a steam-tug, each having its own master and crew, collided with
and sunk a steam-dredge lying at anchor at a proper place, displaying good
signal-lights, and having competent lookouts stationed on her decks. The
tug and the ship having been libelled and seized, the former gave a stipulation for value for $16,000. Both were found to be at fault; and the court
below entered a decree awarding the libellants .524,184.57 damages, with interest and costs, and directing that one half of the amount be paid by the ship,
and the remaining half by the stipulators for the tug. Held, that the decree
should be modified so as to further provide that any balance of the moiety
decreed against either vessel, which the libellants shall be unable to collect,
shall be paid by the other, or by her stipulators, to the extent of her stipulated
value beyond the moiety due from her.
