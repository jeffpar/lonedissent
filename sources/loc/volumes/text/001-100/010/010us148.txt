priate to himself the land described in Oneal's entry,
and that if he had no design, he was still respon5ible
for the consequences of the illeal survey.
Anderson by his answer denies all fraud, and most
positively denies that he gave Massie any instructions to
make the survey, as falsely stated in the bill. I hat the
survey was made of 530 acres, in part of the entry,
which survey'was returned to his (Andcrson'b) offit e,
and which he did not record for about the term of
one year from the time he received it, doubting whether
the survey had been properly made ; but after a critical
examination of the subject he concluded that it was
not improperly riade and recorded it.
The plaintiff amended his bill again by charging
that the defendant Massie was the owner of Powell's
entry, and had surveyed and obtained a.grant therefor,
and calling upon him to answer when he became the
purchaser of Powell's right.
To this Massie answered, that. after surveying
Oneal's entry in the spring 1797, he purchased Robert
Powell's survey, before which time he had no interest
in. the land, and has sold the whole of it, but made a
conveyance of only a part.
There had been certain facts found in the cause
by a jury according to a practice heretofore adopted
in chancery suits in the courts of Kentucky, but the
court ordered ,that the facts found by the jury should
be set aside."
The following opinion of 7udge Innis (Judge
Todd being absent) states the facts of. the cise so
fully that nothing need be added in stating the case.
" The complainant having acquired the equitable
right to certain lands conferred on Ferdinand Oneal
by the state of Virginia, as a bounty for'military

to cover almost the whole base of 1,560 poles, the"

hold. To form a correct opinion in this case the
several -entries of 'Massie, Powell'and Oneal must
be brought into one vieco and, as far as it is possible,
consistent with the' entries, to pscert in the object and"
intention of the locator. It is evident, from the manner in which these entries are worded, that the lo.
sor had no doubt in his mind, at. the time the entries
were made, of having given that space which vvquld
enable him to secure, by legal Aurveys, the.quantity of
land located for each person. It becomes, then, the
duty of the court to consider the case with a reference
to this object. No difficulty arises as to the manner
in which the'entry of Thomas Massie ought to be surveyed, the 'calls of his entry being express idpositive.
His -etryought to have been surveyed in the following
manner ; to begin, as he has done, at the junction of
Paint creek, and the Scioto, and then to run up the.
river so far as will ascertain the termination of the 520
poles called for on the river, when reduced to a straigline. This will reduce .his base to a point below thefirst flooded land represented in the connected plat,
i 3ove the mouth of Paint creek, thence he is to run

Massie.

Oneal's suhrey ought, therefore, to have-been enecu,
ted in-the same manner as it is now decided. Poweil'o
ought to have been made by beginning at the termina.
tion of 520 poles on the river, and thence to run off at
right angles from that point.
.Having decided the manner in which the entries of
Massie, Powell, and Oneal .ought to have been surveyed, it remains yet to say what is the situation of the
survey for 530 acres of 'land made for Oneal, and
placecl'on th: record book of the surveyor. To make
this act obligatory on the party it was necessary that
all the acts .done should have been performed or appro.
ved by Oneal himself, or some one of his assignees, or
by some agent authorized for that purpose. There io.
no evidence in the cause to this effect: the placing the
.survey on the "surveyor's book is therefore an unauthorized and void act.
In the case of Wilson and Mason, in the late district
court, the court -decided -that a' survey "once recorded

Upon this view of the case, the court is of opinionthat the complainant recover of the defendant one
thousand acres of land, to be laid-off agreeably to the
mode pointed oat as the proper manner for surveying
Oneal's entry.
That upon the defendant Massies conveying thb
said one thousand acres of land to the complainant, he,
the cotnpluinant, shall assign to the said defendant all
his right in and-to one thousand acres of the warrant

issued to the said Oneal.

So fat as this quit relates to the defendant.Anderson,
it is decreed and ordered that the -bill be dismissed as
to him with costs, the court being of opinion he was
improperly made a party. . It is therefore considered
by the court, that the defendant Anderson recover -of
the coniplainant his costs by him in this behalf expended.
And afterwards, at the same term, the following order
was made herein. The court in pursuance of the opihi6n and decree delivered'in this cause on the eighth
day of this month (Decerbber) doth order, that the
surveyor of Ross county do go on the land in controiversy and lay off the same as follows: Thomas Massie's entry by begirining at the mouth of Paint creek,
thence up the Scioto so far as will amount to 520.poles
ivhen reduced to a straight line, and from each end of
this base! at right.angles from the general course so fai
that a line parallel with that general course will produce
the quantity of fourteen hundred acres. Robert Powell's entry by beginning at the upper comer of Thomas
Massie's entry, that is, 520 poles from the mouth of
Paint creek, thetice up the river so far as will amount
to 520 poles when reduced to a straight line, and from
the end of this base line, a line is to be run at right
angles .to .the general course of that portion of the
river which'is- occupied by the base line and fromn the
beginning with the lines of Thomas Massie, that is, his.
second and third lines, so for that a line paraltel to the
general course of this base line will produce the quantity of one thousand acres. Ferdinand Ontal's entry
by beginning at the upper corner of Robert, Powell's
entry- when laid off as aforesaid, thence up the Scioto
so far is will amount to 520 poles when reduced to a
straight line, and from the end of this base line a line
is to be run at right angles from the general course of
that portion of thbe river which is occupied by the base
line, and from the beginning with the second and third
lines of Powell so far that a line parallel td the general
course of the base line will fp.duce the quantiti, of cne

veyor do make and bound the said survey of Oneat

metes and bounds and his proceedings herein to the
next court."
At May term, 1808, the surveyor'having made his
report, a final decree- was entered in conformity with
the principles laid down in the interlocutory order,
from which the.defendant appealed. Pope, for the plaintiff in error, contended that the
circuri court in Kentucy, had no jurisdiction of a case
involving the title of land lying in Ohio, unles it be
upon a peronalcontract. Here ias no personal contract. Although the bill states an agreement respecting the surveying of the land, yet it is denied' by the
answer, and not proved. Besides, if there was such a
contract, it is not upon the contract that the suit is
brought. IL is a mere question which of the parties
-has the better right under their several entries.. The
remedy in chancery in Kentucky is merely a substitute.
for a caveat. It is in the nature of a real action, .which
is local. A court in New-York could not try the_ title
of land. in -Virginia, unless it were upon a .personat
contract. Even the action of tresppiss quare caausmnz

defendant below, to the jurigdiction of the court by,
which th6 decree was renacpted.

Taking into viesâ‚¬ the character of'the suit in chancety brought to establish a prior title originating under
the land law of Virginia against a person claimhing un'der a senior patent, considering it as a substittIte for a
caveat introduced .by the peculiar circumstances attend.'
ing those titles, this court is ot opinion, that there is
much reason -br considering it as a local action, and
-for confining it to the court sitting within the state in
which the lands lie. Was this cause, therefore, to be.
considered as involving a naked question of title, was
it, for ezample, acontest between Watts and Powell,
the jurisdiction of the circuit court of Kentucky would
not be sustained. But Ohere the question changes its
character, where the defendant in the original action
is liable to the plaintiff, either'in consequence of con.
tract, or as trustee, or a,, tie holder of a legal tide
acquired by any species ot mala fides practised on the
plaintiff, the principles of equity give a court juris."
diction wherever the person may be found, and the
circumstancei that a question of. title may be iAvolved
in the inquiry, and may even constitute the esiential
point on which the case depends, does not seem sufficient to arrest that-jurisdiction.
In the .celebrated case .of Penn v. Lord,Baltimore,'
the Chancellor of England decreed a specific performa.
contract respecting lands lying in North
an'e of -it
America. The objection to -the jurisdiction of the
court, in that case, as reported by Vetey, vas not
that the lands lay -without the jurisdiction of the court,
but that, in cases relating to boundaries between provinces, the jurisdictio was exclusively in the king
and. council. 'It is in reference to this objection, not
to an objecton that the lands were without his jurisdiction, that the chancellor says, 6 This court, therefore, has no "original jurisdiction on the direct ques.
tion of the original right of boundaries.?' The reason why it had no original juriddiction on this direct
question was, that the decision on The extart of those
grants, including dominion and poiltical Fower, as well

a

as property, was exclusively reserved to the king in
council.
In a subsequentpart of the opinion, where he treats
of the objection to the jurisdiction of the court, arising from its inability to enforce its. decree in rem, he
allows no.weight to that argument. The strict primary decree of a court of equity is, he says, inleryonam,
and may be enforced in all cases where the person is
within its jurisdiction.-- In confirmation of this position he cites the practice of the courts- to decree respecting lands lying in reland and in the. colonies, if
the person, against whom tne decree was prayed, be
found in England.
In the case of Arglasse v. .Muscharnp, I Venrwn, 75.
the defendant, residig in Engl,.nd, having trauduledtly obtained a rent charge on lands lying in Ireland, a
bill was brought in Engiand to set it aside. To an"ob.
jection made to the jurisdiction of. the coert the chancellor replied, "This is surely only a jest put upon the
jurisdiction of this court by- the comm9rr lawyers; for
when you go about .to bind the lands and grant a sequestration .to execute a decree, then they readily tell
you that the authority of tljib court is only to regulate
a manis conscience, and ought not to affect the estate,
but that this court must agere in personam only; and
when, as in this case, you prosecute the person for a
fraud, they tell you that you must not intermeddle
here, because, the fraud, though committed here,
concerns lands that lie in Ireland, which makes the
jurisdiction local, 'and so wholly elude the jurisdiction
of this court.". The chancellor, in that case, sustained his jurisdiction .on principle, and on the authority of
Archer and Preston, in which case a contract made respecting lands in Ireland, the title to which depended
on the act of settlement," was enforced in England, al.
though the defendant was a resident, of Ireland, and
had only made a casual visit to England. -On a rehearing before Lord Keeper. North this decree was
affirmed.

In the. year 1796, Nathaniel Massie surveyed 530
acres of Ofneal's entry, chiefly within Stall's survey,
and afterwards,-in the spring'of 1797-, pbichased Poweli's survey. Nathaniel Massie's entry is survexed
and patented.. In 1801 Massie received from Watts,
in money, the customary -compensation for.making 'his

can be found. In either action the manner in which
the service was performed is ifievitably the subject of
investigalion, and the difficulty of making it cannot out
the court of itsjurisdiction.
From the nature of the busines- and the situation
of the parties, the person for whom the location is
made being generally a non-resident, and almost universally unacquainted with the country in which his
land is placed, it is the duty of the locator not only to
locate the lands, but to show them to the surveyor. He
also necessarily possesses the power to amend or to
change the loction if he has suficient reason to be.
lieve that it is for the interest of his employer so to do.
So far as respects the location he is substituted in the
place of the owner,, and his acts done bona fide are the
acts of the owner.
If, under these circumstances, a locator finding that
the entry he has made cannot be surveyed, instead of
withidrawing it-or amendifig it. so as to render it susceptible of being carried ino execution, secures the
adjoining land for himself, and shows other land, to the
sufveyor which the location cannot be construed to
comprehend, it appears to this court to be a breach of
duty, which amounts to a violation of thd implied contract, and subjects him to the action of the party injured.
If the location be sustainable, and the Iocator, instead of showing the land really covered by the entry,
shows other land, and appropriates to himself the land
actually entered, this appears to the court to be a
species of ma/a ficte which will, ip equity, convert him
into a trustee for the party qriginally entitled. to the
land.
In either case the jurisdiction of tbg court of the
btate in which the person is found, is sustainable.

If we.reason from those principles which are jaid

oof equity, the jurisdiction of the court, of Kentucky

is either liable under his contract, or as trustee.

nearly the same, no difficulty would have been found
in this case. The surveys might have conformed literally to all the calls of each entry, and each tract
would have constituted nearly a rectangular figure. with
a base of 520 poles on the river, and a back line parallel to that base. But the unexpected bends of the
Scioto have deranged the uniformity of this chain of
locations, and produced questions of considerable intricacy respecting the ground which must be covered
by them.
Thomas,Massiels entry being .of 1,400 acres, and
Powell's of only 1,000 acres, with a base of the same
length on the river, it probably was thought certain
that Massie's upper line would extend beyond Poweli's land, and that the line of Powell, wh'ich was to
run parallel to the river, would intersect Massies upper line. Powell's entry, therefore, calls to run from
the river with Massie's line, so far that a line parallel
to the general course of the river ,will include the
quantity. Upon actual survey the course of the river
is found to be such that a line parallel thereto, drawn
from the enid of Massie's line, would not include 200
acres of land. Under these circumstances Powell
must lose between 8 and 900 acres of land, if his entry cannot be so construed as to extend beyond the
length of 1%assie's line.
From the peculiar situation of titles acquired under
the land law of Virginia, a law which offered for sale
an immense unexplored wilderness, covered with savages equally fierce and hostile, leaving to the purchaser
the right to place his warrant, which was the evidence
of his purcihase, on any land not previously appropria.
ted, and r, 4uiiing him to make his entries so certainly
that any-other person might locate the adjacent residuum, it followed inevitably that immense difficulties
would occur, and that locations must often be lost, or
receive *thatcertainty which tjh law required from principles adapted to the -general state of things in the
,country, butwihich ere not precisely foreseen when .
the locations were made.

These principles have- bten laid down by the courts,and must be considered as expositions of the statute.
A great proportion of the landed 'property of 'the
country deptnds on adhering, to them.
The great and eqitable, founhdation on which they
stand is this. , If, by any reasonable construction of
an entry, it can be' supported, the courts will- supprort
it. This principle absolutely requires thdt. all discre.
tion, with respect to the mdde - of surveying an entry,
should be -surrendered. For if a 'lcation, might be
surveyed in various 'vays, then it is vague, 'aid a6
subsequent locator would know how to enter the ada.
cent residuum.. The courf; therefore, is compelled to
say in what manner every location, which appears, in
its terms, to reserve some power in the locator to vary
its form, shall be surveyed.
In the exercise of. this essentiat and necessary
power, they have declared that when a given quantity
of land is to be laid off on a given base, it shall, be in-,
cluded within four lines, so that the lines proceeding
from.the base shall.be.at right angles With- it, and h"
line opposite the base shall be parallel to. it, unless- this
form be repugnant -tor the entry.
The consequence, of this principle is, that if the
calls of an entry do not fully deicribe' the land, but
furnish-enough to -enable the court to complete the'location by the application of certain principles; .- hey
will complete it.
They have also decided'that, if a location have c~r
tain material calls sufficient to support it- and to.de;
scribe the land, other calls less material and incompatible with the esedtiiial calls of -the entry,' may be 'dis-,
carded.
'

These principles, it is beieved, will'enable the court
to ascertain, in a reasonable manner, the lafid covered"
by PowelPs location.

Scioto,.

A base line upon the river is then given to

consist of 520 poles, when reduced to a straight line.
IMassie's upper line, to its whole extent, it necessary,
is also given, and a back line parallel to the base is
given. The sid- line opposite Massie's line, and the
course from the termination of Massie's line to the,
back line are wanting, and aie to be supplied by coanstruction.
The materiaf inquiry, so far as respects the present
cause, is, in what directioh'shall Powell's upper line,
extending back from tht river to the line parallel to the
general course of the river, be run ? Fhat line is not
given, and is, consequently, to be supplied by construetiOn.
According to the uniform course of decisions, Powells upper line must project from the base at right
angles with it, unless there shall be some other call in
the entry which controls this general'principle.
It is
contendcdothat it is controllel by the call to run with
Massie's line from tht beginning. Mas'sie's line not
being at right anigles with the base .line, it is argued
that Powel's 9ppiosite line, Zliscarding the rectangular
principle, must be parallel to the line from the b.egitL.
ning.

But thc court does not concur with "thc counsel for
the plaintiff in error in 'this -opinion. The principle,
that the rectangular- figuie is to be preferred to any
other, and'is to be preserved whenever it can be preserved, originates in the necessity of adopting some
xegular figure in order to give to locations that cer-"
taintv which is not always to be-fbund in their terms,
and in the .superior convenience of that figure over
every otaef, with.- respect to the adjacent residuum.
These motives apply to a part as wel as to the whole of
an entry. If one location be made upon another so
that the lines of that other bind the entry on one side,
and then a precise line be called for from the begin.
nling to run a certain distance, from the end of which
a line is to be drawn, and to continue until a line, parallel to the first or base line, or to some given point in

FEBRUARY, 181O.

167

the lines of the person on whom the location is made,
shAdl include the quantity, the same respect for cer"tainty and convenience which induced originally the
adoption of the rectangular figure would seem to require its- adoption with respect to those lines which did
not receive a different direction from the positive calls
of the location. On one Side there might be several
difft-rent lines; but this would not seem to demand that,
on the opposite side, the same variety' should -be preserved. * It would be- departing from the principle unnecessarily to require that the lincs of the opposite
side of the tract. should be multiplied in order to be all
parallel to the lines by which one side was unavoida.
bly bounded. To the court it-seems that the rectangular principle is always to be preserved where it can
be preserved, that is, where there is no call in the entry
applying to the lines -which control them, and that,
where it is necessarily departed from, the departure
should not be extended. further than the necessity rew
quires.
In this particular case the location does not call for
a line parallel to M assie's line, and, as Massie's line
-was to run at right angles from the general course of
the river, and it was obviously expected PowelPs line
would not extend the whole length of Massie's line,.it
is clear that the locator expected that Powell's upper
line, *vhen at right angles with the course of the. river,
would be nearly parallel to Massie's line,
This may he considered as, in some degree, an auxiliary argument in favour of the'opinion which is entertained, by this couitt that, the circuit court did right in
laying dawn the upper line. of Powell at right angles
with his bas line;
This linp being-established, it is of little importance
to Oneal's claim in what manner the 'remaining linei.
of Powell may.be run.
The call of the location, so far as respects the side
binding on Massie, -is said to stop at Massie's north.
western corner. Is that line to be continued?

SUPREME COURT U. S.

The conclusive objection to it is, that it would intersect the upper line before the quantity was obtained,
and Would, consequently, entirely defeat the call for a
back line parallel to the course of the river.
Is a' line 'at-right tingles with the general course of
the river to be run from Massie's corner and continued
until a line parallel to, the base line would include the
quantity?
This wyould, be. less exceptionable, but it *irould be
departing further from the square, and might, in some
instances, exhibit a'plat the breadth of which would
not be one third of its' length. This iloint, however,
is not critically examined, because it is of very little
importance in the liresent cause. The upper line of
Powell, on which Oneal, binds, would be the same-its
far as it now runs, and should it be continued further.'
it would only'take a sm.all angle of Oneal's sturvey as
made by order of the circuit court.
The court is of opinion that Pow-eli's e6try is rightly
sW veyed by order of the circuit court, and it is an additional argument in support of this opinion, that, with
the exception of the -angle unavoidably made.by the
interference of Massie, the general form of the land
approaches a- squiare more- nearly than if laid off in
any other manner.
If Powell's entry be correctly surveyed, Oneal's
cannot be laid off otherwise than it is.
I Were it even to be admitted that the original survey
made for Powell was correct, it is entirely possible
that 'the case of the pfainiiff would not be maferially
iimproved thereby.
Pow'ell's back line would' probably terminate on the
river- in which eventthat would be his upper corner
on the Scioto, %Ohichi6. called" for as the beginning of
Oneal's entry. Oneal then calls to run on th, river a
distance of 520 poles on a straight line, and with Powell's line so far as that a line parallel to 'the general

According to the cleanest and best establichWe princi.

He cannot hold the land under an

Sentry for himself otherwise than as trustee for his

So far, then, as Oneal's land is withinsMase's survey, Massie is a trustee.for Oneal and his assignees,
and upon 'the principle stated in the earl; part of this
opinion, thi; court of Kentucky had jurisdiction of, the

But a part of OCn eal's lan6 issurveyed f6r Powell,
and in a contest between his assignees and Powell, the

controversy, however, is not with Powell; it is,
with
'Massie, 'who is the purchaser of Powell's rights. The
whole property being thus in the hands of Massie, and
the court of Kentucky being in possession of the cause,
and, having clear jurisdiction of a part of it which decides the principle on which the whole depends, that
court did right indeciding the whole cause, and decreeing to the assignees Of Oneal the whole land originally
included in the entry made for him.
Considergble doubts- were entertained respecting the
right of Watts to iiore than the unsurve;-ed pArt of
the entry. But a majority of the court. is of opinion
that he stands precisely in the ptace of Oneal.
* As Massie does not show that he had' conveyed any
of that parf of Powell's survey which is included with.
in Oneal's entry previous to the institution of this sun4
or even now, the allegation that he has conveyed a
part .of Powell's survey could hot furnish sufficient
matter for preventing the decree which was rendered.
The decree of the circuit court is affirmed with
costs.
