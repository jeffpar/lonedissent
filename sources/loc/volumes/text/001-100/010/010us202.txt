SUPREME COURT, U. S.

The view which we have taken of this subject affords

an answer to the fifth ground, and, in a great measure,,
-M,As. So, tb the fourth.
We consider the insured, upon every revaluation,'as
in under his former right of membership, and, of
consequence,. that the plaintiffs come under the description of persons who had insured before 1804; and, for
the same reason, the representation of Scot (could
any. effect at all be given to the circumstances to which
he testifies) was true, as to the membership of ohe
plaintiffs, And as to their liability in that capacity; They
must have known it was a question of lawi on which
Scot possessed no power to commit the society, and on
which the plaintiffs themselves ought to have 'been as
well informed as any other individual.
Judgment affirmed.

The question (which was submitted without argtument) was, whether the additional premium should be
charged.on the whole sum 4t which the buildings were
revalued, or only on the excess between the old and
new valuation.

on the subject of premium imposes the additional
premium only on the excess of'the revaluation beyond
the former valuation.
