THE SCHOONER JULIANA v. THE UNITED

and
THE SHIP ALLIGATOR v. THE UNITED

THESE were appeals from the sentence of (the itio %vas

the sentence of the district court, which condemned a,

ing an embargo on all ships and vessels in- the ports be w;th an in
and harbours of the United Statea," by putting goods trnt to, export
from the Juliana on board the Alligator.
The libel, in the case of the Juliana, stated, that on
the first of January, 1808, she, being a Swedish vessel,
cleared from Baltmore for' Port au Prince, having-on
board 100 barrels of herrings,-which were on board
when her master was notified of the embargo, that
sbe proceeded on her voyage to her port of desunation,
but before she left Ptapsco river, there were laden on
board of her a complete cargo of.merchandise, foreign
and domestic, with which she proceeded, in pros-cution of her said voyage, until the 1st of Jpnuary, 1808,
when she was arrested by"the officer ot the customhouse of the port of Baltimore, and brought back,
after which, and while she was in that port,. viz. the
IIth of January, 1808, sundry goods, described in -the
libel,, were taken and removed from the Juliana and
put on board the Alligator, then lying in the port of

of the said United Sates. in such case made and prwviSded, and with nitent to violate the provsiaons of the std
statutes, for whicl causeshe was seiz, d by the colk ecor
of that port as forfeited. The libel in the case of the
Alligator was a copy of that against the Juliana.
The words of that part of the 3d section of the act
of January 9, 1808, vol. 9. p. II. upon which theselioc-s were foIled, arc as follows:
Cc And

be it further enacted, that if any ship or vessel
shall, during the continuance of the act to which- this
act is a supol.-me nt, depart from any. port of the U.,ited
S at-s without a clearance or permit , or if ans ship or
vessel shadl, contrary to the provisions of this act, or of
the act to which this act is a supplem,-nt, procted to a
foreign port or place, or trade with or put on 'board of
anv other ship or vessel, any goods, wares or merch:ndise, of forrign or domestic growth or manufacture, such ships or vt ssls, goods, wares and merchandise, shall be wholly forfeited."
Harper and Mlartin, for the appellants, contended.
That the sentence ought to be reversed,
1. Because it appears from the libel that if any goods
were put on board the Alligator, it was after the Juliana liad been stized and brought back, and while the
Alligator was at the wharf a perfect hulk, totally unfit
to proceed on a voyage, and entirely passive as to any
improper use made of her.
2. The libel does not charge that the goods put on
board the Alligator were the same which were on
board the Juliana when she was seized and brought back.
S. It does not charge that tht owner of the Alligator
had any knowledge of, or concern in, the business.
4. The evidence is insufficient to prove any cause
-bf condemnation.

5. It is -not averred that the goods were put on
board the Alligator with ntent to export them; which
is the offence contemplated by the act.

6. The libel does not allege that the seizure was
made within the district of the seizing officer; nor upon
the water. It does not appear to be a case of admiralty
jurisdiction..
The Attorney-General, on the-next day, abandoned
the causes as untenable.
Sentence reversed, and restitution ordered.
