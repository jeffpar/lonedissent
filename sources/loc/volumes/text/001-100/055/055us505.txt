SHEPPARD AND JOHN DUNCAN, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, V.

PEYTON

S.

GRAVES.

It is a bad mode of pleading, to unite pleas in abatement -and pleas to the merits.
And ifafter pleas in abatement, a defence be interposed., going to the merits bf the
controversy, the grounds alleged in abatement become thereby immaterial and are
waived.
When a plea is filed to the jurisdiction of the court, upon the ground that the plaintiff is a resident of the same State with the defendant, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove the allegation.
It is of no consequence whether the date of a promissory note be at the beginning or
end of it.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the District
Court of the United States for the District of Texas.
The facts are all set forth in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by 3ir. V E. Howard and hir. Ballinger,in a
printed argument, for the plaintiffs in error, and Air. Davidge
and 31r. 0. F. ohnson, for the defendant in error.
The points made by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error,
were the following:
1. The court erred ii. -admittingthe notes in evidence, because
there was a variance betv, -en the notes offered and those described in the petitions.
The petitions alleged, that the notes'were "executed and delivered at Matagorda,) but did not allege that they bore date at
Matagorda, as was found to be the fact on their being produced.

SUPREME

COUR..

Sheppard et al. v. Grave-s.

It was the plaintiff's duty to give a perfect description of his
notes, so as to prevent the possibility of the defendants being
ever sued upon them again, and if so, that this record should be
a bar.
The place at which the notes bore date on their face, was
essential to their description. When the objection was made,
the plaintiff could have amended, and given an accurate description; but.refusing to do this, it was error in the court to
admit the notes.
I Thus, the words "value received," are material in a descriptior of the note; and if omitted, the variance will be fatal. 1
Chitty's Pleadings, 339, note 1, ed. 1833; Saxon v. Johnson, 10
Johns. R. 418.
2. The court erred in refusing to instiuct the jury, "that,
upon the issue as to the citizenship of plaintiff, the burden of
proof was on the plaintiff to show such citizenship as entitled
him. to sue ;" and in giving'the instruction, "that the plaint ff
was to be considered a citizen of Louisiana, as alleged in his
petition, unless it was pleaded and proved -thathe was a citizen
of Texas."
There was a proper plea to the jurisdiction of the court, presenting the issue as"to the citizenship of plaintiff.
It was not necessary that the plea should be verified by affidavit. Hartley's Digest, art. 690, § 31, Practice, act 1846.
Besides, there was no demurrer or excep~ion taken to the plea
for want of an affidavit; and if one had been necessary, it was
waived by the plaintiff taking issue on the fact.
The rule which at first prevailed in the courts of the United
States, required the plaintiff, on the general issue, to prove citizenship as alleged. Catlett & Keith v. Pacific Insurance Com,pany, Paine's C. C. R. 594.
It was afterwards decided, however, that a plea in abatement
was .ecessary to raise the question of citizenship. D'Wolf v.
Rabaud et al. 1 Peters, 476. See 498.
The courts of the United States are courts of limited jurisdiction; and although a plea to the merits admits the jurisdiction, yet when jurisdiction is denied by a 3roper plea, it must
be shown by1 the plaintiff See 1 Cowen & Hill's Notes to Phillips', Ev. p. 487, note 376, and authorities referred to; Maples v.
Wightman, 4 Conn. R. 376; Wooster v. Parsons, Kirby's R. 27.
The counsel for the defendant in error contended, that there
was no variance between I he note alleged in the petition of defendant in error, (R. I and 2,) and that offered in evidence.
1. The petiqion alleged the place where the note bore date, in
the usual form, even under the-English practice, and with greater

certainty than is required by the law of Texas. But, had
there been no such allegation, the omission would have beep
immaterial. 1 Saund. P1. and Ev. 260.
2. That there was no error in the refusal of the court below
to grant the first prayer of the plaintiffs in error, which plainly
tended to mislead the jury, is manifest, and, indeeu, is conceded
their counsel.

theThe
court
in refusing to instruct the jury, "that
upon the issue as to the citizenship of plaintiff, the burden of
proof was on the plaintiff to show such citizenship as entitles
him to sue;" and in giving the instruction, "that the plaintiff
was to be considered a citizen of Louisiana, as alleged in his
petition, unless it was pleaded and proved that he was a citlzen
of Texas."
Exception to the capacity of the plainiff below to sue if'the
District Court, could only be taken by plea in abatement. 'Conard v. The Atlantic- Ins. Co. 1 Pet. 386, 450; D'Wolf v. Rabaud et al. Id. 476, 498; Evans v. Gee, 11 Pet. 80,.83; Sims v.
Hundley, 6 How. 1, 5; Smith v. Kernochen, 7 How. 198, 216.
Such being the case, and as the obligation of 'proving any
fact lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative
of the issue, the burden of proof was necessarily upon the defendants below.
Tim plea is strictly affirmative in its character, alleging, in
terms and substance, that the plaintiff was not entitled to sue in
the District Court, because he "is, and was at the commencement of this suit, a citizen of the State of Texas." Being introductive of new matter, and concluding, as it very properly
does, with a verifieation, the defendants below, Vho pleaded it,
held the affirmative, inseparably connected with which was the

Indeed, the definition of a plea in abatement, (in the nature
of which is a plea to the jurisdiction, or to the person of the
plaintiff,) is, that by it the defendant "shows cause why he
should not be implended, or if impleaded, not in the manner
and form he now is." Bac. Abr., Abatement.
Whenever thi plea is to the jurisdiction, it must state another
jurisdiction. Id.

Mr.Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion ot the court.
The defendant in error, in conformity with a mode of practice
in the State of Texas, instituted an action at law against the
plaintiffs in error upon their promissory note. That note was
in the words following:
"On the first day of January, 1850, we jointly and severally
prormse to pay to Peyton S. Graves, or order, at the counting
ouse of R. & D. G. Mills, in Brazoria County, the sum of

-

"Matagorda Sept'r 23d, 1844."
The petition: sets forth, that Peyton S. Graves, a citizen and
inhabitant of Louisiana, represents, that Abram Sheppard and
John Duncan, both citizens and residents of the county of Matagorda, in the State of Texas, are jointly and severally indebted
to the petitioner in the sum of $1,845.94, with interest thereon,
at eight per cent per 'annum, from the first day -of January,
1844, until *paid-- for that heretofore, to wit, at Matagorda, in
The State of Texas, on the 23d day of September, 1844, the
said Sheppard, who signs his name Abm. Sheppard, and the said
Duncan, executed and delivered to the petitioner, their joint and
several promissory note, dated September 23d, 1844, and signed
A1bn. Sheppard and John Duncan, by which, &c.
-Upon the summons issued against each of the defendants,
tlhe marshal returns, that he had executed the summons on the
12th of October, 1850, serving each of them with a certified
copy of the petition and summons, and with regarid to Duncan,
the retuin farther states that the original summons, was also
exhibited-to him. The plaintiffs in error appeared to the action,
and attempted to interpose several defences in the nature of
pleas in abatement. They first allege jointly, that" the court
could not take cognizance of the cause, because the plaintiff
below, was not, at the commencement of, the suit, a citizen of
Louisiana, but of the State of Texas.
The defendant Sheppard, then pleads separately, that the
marshaFs return upon the summons was not legal, and should
be quashedbecause it does not state, that the marshal had delivered to the defendant in person; a copy of the citation, and
of the petition accompanying it; and that the return was not

made and signed by the deputy purporting to make and sign
the same.
The defendant Duncan also pleads separately in abatement,
that the citation calls upon him to answer the complaint against
him and Abraham Sheppard, whereas the true name of said
Sheppard is Abram, and not Abraham; and he also insists upon
the insufficiency of the return to the summons, because, as he
alleges, that return does not state that the marshal delivered to
him in person, a copy of the citation, or of the petition accompanying it.
In addition to these pleas in abatement, the defendants below
interposed a defence upon the merits in the nature of the general issue, by which they deny all and singular the' matters
stated in the petition, and say that they are not indebted to the
plaintiff as he has alleged, and in this defence they conclude to
the country, whilst in the introduction thereto, they declare that
they do not waive their several pleas in at atement, but fully
rely upon the same. After this series, of heterogeneous defences, the plaintiff moved the court to 9trike out the plea to the
jurisdiction and all the other pleas in abatement tendered by the
defendants, assigning, as the grounds of this motion, that those
pleas were not filed within the time required by law.
Upon the trial of the cause, the court seems to have considered
the case as standing before it upon all the defences attempted,
but ruled out the several pleas in abatement, though whether
for the insufficiency of those pleas in point of law, for the want
of proof to sustain them, or for their irregularity in the order of
pleading, does not certainly appear from this record. The jury
upon the issue joined upon the merits, rendered a verdict for the
plaintiff for the sum of $2,78S.89, for which judgment was given
with costs.
The incongruities in practice, which mark the progress of this
case in the court-below, are much to be regretted, as having a
tendency to confound the proceedings in courts of justice ;. proceedings calculated to define and distinguish the rights of parties litigant, and to conduct the courts to a correct adjudication
upon those rights; proceedings indeed founded upon, and as it
were sanctified by, an experience of their usefulness, and even
of their necessity. Thus it has ever been received as a canon'
of pleading, that matters which appertain solely to the jurisdiction of a court, or to the disabilities of the suitor, should never
be bleiided with questions which enter essentially into the subject-matter of the controversy.; and that all defences involving
inquiries into that subject-matter imply, nay -admit, the competency of the parties to institute such inquiries, and the authority of the court to adjudicate upon them. Hence it is, that
43 .*

pleas to the jurisdiction or in abatement, are deemed inconsistent with those which appertain to the merits of a cause; they
are fried upon different views as to the relations of the parties;
alid result in different craclusions. A striking illustration of
the mischiefs flowing from the departure from the rule just stated,
is seen in the practice attempted in the case before us. If it
could be imagined that the plea to the jurisdiction and the plea
to the meritq, could be regularly committed to the jury at the
same time, the verdict might involve the f'ollowing absurdities.
Should the finding be for the plaintiff, the judgment would, as
to the defendant, be upon one issue, that of respondeas ouster,
and upon the other, that he pay the debt, as to the justice of
which he was commanded to answer over. Should the finding
be for the defendant, the judgment upon one issue must be that
the debt was not due, and upon the other, that the court called
upon so to pronounce, had no authority over the case. So that
in either aspect there must, under this proceeding, be made and
determined one issue, which is incongruous with and immaterial
to the other. A practice, thus fraught with confusion and perplexity,'and one endangering the rights of suitors, it is exceedingly desirable should be reformed, and we are aware of no
standard of reformation and improvement more safe or more
convenien than that which is supplied by the time-tested rules
of the common law. And by one of those rules, believed to be
without an exception, it is ordained, that objections to the jurisdiction of the court, or to the competency of the parties, are
matters pleadable in abatement only, and that if after such matters relied on, a defence be interposed in tar and going to the
merits of the controversy, the grounds a~llged in abatement become thereby immaterial, and are waived.
With respect to the exception taken t ihe ruling of the Dis.
trict Couit, as to the obligation of the defendant to prove his
averment of the plaintiff's residence in the State of Texas, and
got of Louisiana, as set forth in the petitizn, were the decision
of this question deemed requisite here, we should say that the
true doctrine applicable to the question is this: that although
in the courts of the United States it is necessary to set forth
the grounds of their cognizance as courts of limited jurisdiction,
yet wherever jurisdiction shall be averred in the pleadings, in
conformity with the laws creating those courts, it must be taken
primA facie as existing, and that it is incumbent on him who
would impeach that jurisdiction for causes dehors the pleading,
to allege and prove such causes; that the necessity for the allegation and the burden of sustaining it by proof, both rest upon
the party taking the exception. Such, we think, would be the
proper rule resulting from the intrinsic charf.cter of the exception,

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

Sheppard et al. v. Graves.

and such we consider the doctrine enunciated in the cases of.
Conrad v. The Atlantic Insurance Company, in 1 Pet. 386, and
D' Wolf v. Rabaud et al. Id. 476.
This doctrine we are- unwilling to disturb. The cases just
referred to, as well as those of Silns v. Hundley, in 6 Howard, and
Smith v. Kernochen, (7 Id. 198,) expressly Atirin the commonlaw principle of pleading, herein before mentioned, that the
question of the residence or of the right of the parties to sue, as
incident to residence, cannot be inquired into under the general
issue.
The plea of a misnomer of the defendant Sheppard, by tile
insertion of two superfluous letters in his christian name, and
the still more captious and unmeaning distinction attempted
betvween serving the defendants with a certified copy of the petition and summons in this suit, and a delivery of that petition
and summons to the defendants in person, is disposed of by the
same rule which displaces, as irrelevant and immaterial, the exception taken to the jurisdiction.
The question of variance between the note and the description of it in the petition, it is not easy to comprehend, unless
indeed it is intended by the defendants to insist, that a note
should have its date inserted at its beginning only, and cannot
be dated at the termination of it; for the note at tle bottom
bears upon it the date as well as the place of its execution, viz.
Matagorda, September 23, 1844, and the description and the
petition accord with both these facts. It is true, the petition
contains a recital that Matagorda is within the State of Texas,
but by no extreme of cavil can this recital be converted into a
misde~cription of the note. Upon the whole case, we think the
judgment of the District Court was correct, and we accordingly
order it to be affirmed.

SHEPPARD

AND JoHN DUNCAN,

PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR,

v. PEYTON S. GRAvEs.
In this case, as in the preceding, it is decided, that where the plaintiff averred enough
to show the jurisdiction of the court and the defendant pleaded in abatement that
the plaintiff was disabled from bringing the suit, on aiccount of residence, it was
incumbent upon the defendant to sustain the allegation by proof.
Until that was done, it was not necessary for the plaintiff' to offer any evidence upon
the subject.

THIS case was brought up by writ of error, from the District
Court of the United States for the District of Texas.
The parties were the same as those in the preceding case, and
the point upon which the decision of the court turned was the
same as one of those decided in the preceding case.
It was argued, in conjunction with the other, by the same
counsel.
Mr. Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit between the parties to the case No. 65, and is
in all its features essentially the same with the former case with
one exception, which will be pointed out..
In this suit, as in No. 65, the defendants below demurred to
the petition, pleaded in abatement to the regularity of the service of process, to the disability of the plaintiff on the score of
residence, and then interposed a defence n the nature of the
general issue, but tendered no proofs in support of their defences, either in abatement or in bar. The plaintiff, to sustain
the jurisdiction of the court upon the question of residence, and
to meet the pleas in abatement, offered to read the deposition
of two witnesses Rugely and Blair, residents of the city of
New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana, taken de bene esse before a Commissioner in the city of New Qrleans, under the act
of Congress of 1789. The reading of these depositions was
objected to by the defendants, because the Commissioner did
not certify that the witnesses resided at fi greater distance than
one hundred. miles from the place of trial, but stated only that
they were residents of the city of New Orleans, within the
Eastern. District of the State of Louisiana, and beyond the
jurisdiction of the District Court of Texas. The court permitted the introduction of oral evidence to prove that the city
of New Orleans was at a greater distance than one hundred
miles from Galveston, fhe place of trial; and ruling also that
the-dourt itself knew .judicially the mail. routes and distances
thereof, and that New Orleans, tJie place of taking said depositions, was more than one hundred fniles -from Galveston, the
1lade of trial, permitted the depositions to be read in evidence.

DECEMBER TERhf, 1852.

518

Marsh et al. v. Brooks et al.

Whether the District Court erred in allowing an omission in
the certificate of the Commissioner to be supplied by oral evidence, or could regularly act upon knowledge assumed to be
within its judicial cognizance, we do notconsider it necessary
to examine, in order to dispose of the case before us. It must
be recollected that the defendants below, attempted no proof
whatsoever in support of any of their pleas. The plaintiff
having averred enough to show the jurisdiction of the court,
and nothing' having been adduced to impeach it, that jurisdiction remained as stated, and the plaintiff could lose nothing by
adducing either imperfect evidence, or no evidence at all, in
support of that which clearly existed, and which he, under the
circumstances, could not be called on to sustain. Even then
had the case in the District Court stood upon an issue regularly
formed upon the pleas in abatement, the evidence of the depositions was wholly unnecessary -the ruling of the court upon
that evidence was immaterial, and should not impair the
strength of the plaintiff's case, which was perfect without it. But
the exception to the ruling of the court on this point, must be
unavailable upon another view, as given in our consideration of
the preceding case. By interposing, the plea of the general issue after their several pleas in abatement, the defendants have
effectually waived those pleas, and surrendered the positions
covered by them. The judgment of the Circuit Court must in
this case also be affirmed.
