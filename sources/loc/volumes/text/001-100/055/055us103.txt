KAINE, AN ALLEGED FUGITIVE FROM GREAT
BRITAIN.

Under the tenth article of the treaty of 1842. between the United States and Great
Britain, a warrant was issued by a commissioner, at the *instance of the British
Consul, for the apprehension of a person who, it was allegcd, had committed an
assault, with intent to murdr, in Ireland.
The person being arrested, the Commissioner ordered him to be committed, for the
purpose of abiding the order of the President of the United States.
. Aab as corpus was then issued by the Circuit Court of the United States, the Distriet Judge presiding, when, after a hearing, the writ was dismissed, and the prisoner
remanded to custodv.
A petition was then piesented to the Circuit Judge, at his chambers, addressed to the
Justices of the Supreme Court. and praying for a writ of habeas corpus, which was
ret'erred by the Circuit Judge, after a heaiing, to the Justices of the Supreme
Court. in bank, at the commencement of the next term thereof.
At the meeting of the court, a motion was made, with the papers and proeeedings
presented to the Circuit Judge annexed to the petition, for writs of habeas-corpus
and crrtiorarito bring up the defendant and the record from the Circuit Court, for
the purpose of having the decision of that court examined.
The motion was refused; the writs prayed for denied, and the petiion dismissed.

ON the 14th-6f June, 1852, Anthony Barclay, the British Consul at New York, addressed to Samuel R. Betts, Judge of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York, and to any commissioners authorized to perform judicial
duties in the matter, a requisition and complaint. It set forth,
that it had been represented to Ir. Barclay. and was beieyed by
him, that one Thomas Kane, or Kaine, or Cain, then of Cooleen,
in Ireland, did, on or about the 5th of April, 1851, fire i. pistol
at oie James Balfe, with intent to murder him; that a warrant
to apprehend him was issued by a justice of the peace, but that
said Kaine had absconded and fled to the United States. The
requisition further stated, that the crime of which he had been
guilty would have justified his apprehension and commitment
if it had been committed within the United States. It then

asked that a warrant for his apprehension -might be issued, to
the end that the evidence of criminality may be heard and considered; and if, on such hearing, the evidence should be deemed

sufficient, that it should be certified to the proper -executive
authority, in order that a warrant might issue for the surrender
of such fugitive, under the treaty between the United States
and Great Britain.

SUPREME COURT.
In re Kaine.

The truth of this complaint was sworn to by Mr. Barclay.
Kaine was arrested and brought before Joseph Bridgham, a
Commissioner of the United States, at New York.
The case was heard before the Commissioner, who decided,
on the 23d of June, that the evidence was sufficient in law to
justify the commitment of Kaine, upon the charge of assault
with intent to commit murder; and ordered that the prisoner
should be committed, to abide the order of the President of the
United States.
A writ of habeas corpus was sued out, and allowed by Judge
Betts. The writ was returnable to the Circuit Court of the
United States; and, on the 3d of July, Judge Betts, the District Judge, then sitting alone in the Circuit Court, decided
that the writ should be dismissed and the prisoner be remanded
to the custody of the marshal.
On the 17th of July, the Acting Secretary of State issued a
wfarrant, directing the marshal to deliver up Kaine to the British
Consul.
On the 22d of July, Kaine presented a petition to Mr. Justice
Nelson, at his chambers, praying for a writ of habeas cyrpus.
The petition, although handed to Mr. Justice Nelson, whs addressed to the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United
States, which -was not then in session.
On the 3d of August, Mr. Justice Nelson allowed the writ,
and made it returnable on the 11th.
The marshal, in his return, stated the above facts, when, on
the same day, Mr. Justice Nelson ordered as follows:
" The marshal having made the within return, Ordered that,
in consequence of the difficult and important questions involved
in the case, it be heard before all the Justices of the Supreme
Court in bank, at the commencement of the next term thereof;
and that, in the mean time, the prisoner remain in the custody
of the said marshal."
A motion was made in this court for a certiorari,to bring up
the proceedings of the Circuit Court, waen holden by Judge
Betts, which were -printed, and ready to be used if the writ
should be ordered.
In this condition of the case, the court passed the following
order.
On consideration of the petition filed in this cause yesterday,
and of the arguments of counsel thereupon had, as well in support of the application as -against it, it is now here ordered by
the court, that counsel .haye leave to argue the following questions, to wit:
1. Has this court jurisdiction upon the case, as certified by
Judge Nelson ?

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

2. Can a. certiorari issue to bring up the proceedings in the
Circuit Court ?
3. Assuming the court to have jurisdiction, and the proceedings in the Circuit Court -to be legally before this court, is the
party entitled to be discharged?
And it is further ordered by the court, that the same be, and
hereby are, set down for argument on the first Monday of January next.
The unusual length of the opinions delivered by the Judges
prevents the Reporter from inserting the arguments of counsel,
which he would wish to do.
The case was argued by lr. Busteed and Mr. Brady, for the
petitioner, no counsel appearing on the other side.
As the opinions refer to a particular part of the proceedings
and evidence below, it is necessary to insert the following.

live to reap it. Saith, about the hour of 12 o'clock at noon, on
said day, a man named Thomas Cain, or Kain, came up to me
when I was ploughing, armed with a case of pistols. On coming up to me he said to me, 'God save you; are you Peter
Balfe?' I said, don't you know well I am not, Tom. He then
asked, is that Stones' land? I said not; that it was the other
side of the ditch. He then asked me, was I warned to have
nothing to do with it, (Stones' land,) and I said not, except what
I heard from Stones. He then said he came to warn me, and
asked had I a prayer-book. I said not. Well, I have one myself; and he took both pistols in one hand, and took a prayerbook out of his pocket and threw it on the ground towards me.
I stooped to take it up, and while stooping he fired one of the
pistols at me; and on examining my person, I found the mark
of -a bullet and twenty-seven grains of shot in my side, just under my left arm. He was so close that the powder discolored
my coat, and some of the said shot marks was on my left arm.
I then jumped up and ran away, and he followed me some dis-.

SUPREME COURT
In re Kaine.

Mr. Justice CATRON.
The facts adduced on the part of Kaine, the applicant for our
interference, show that a complaint was made out in due form
by counsel, at the instance of the British government, through
its agents, to secure the surrender of the fugitive; and that Mr.
Barclay, the British Consul at. New York, was specially employed, by direct authority of the British Minister, accredited to
this government, to take the proper steps, according to the
tenth article of the treaty of 1842; and furthermore, an officer
of the Irish constabulary, who was able to identify Kaine, had
been sent to Mr. Barclay, with letters from the British Home
Department, to assist in the prosecution.
In pursuance of'this authority, Mr. Barclay made the necessary affidavit, and caused Kaine to be arrested and brought
before Joseph Bridgham, Esquire, a commissioner appointed by
the Circuit. Court of the United States, for the Southern District of New York; who reports the principal facts presented to
him,. as having 'ccurred in Ireland, as follows: "T he original
warrant in this case was issued by James Featherstonhaugh,
Esq., a justice of the peace of the county of Westmeath, Ireland, in which county the alleged crime was committed. The
warrant was produced before me, together with a copy of the
information or affidavit upon which said warrant was issued,
said copy being certified according to the act of Congress, by
the justice of the peace, who issued the warrant, and attested
by the oath of the witness to be a true copy. Jamea Balfe, the
witness who made the information or affidavit, states, among
other things, 'that on the 5th day of April, 1851, he was ploughing some land in the county of Westmeath, when Thomas
Kaine came up to him, armed with a case of pistols, and after
some conversation respecting some land, cf which a man named
Stone had lately been dispossessed, and respecting which the
witness had been threatened, said, that he came to warn the
Witness Balfe about it, and asked if he, witness, had a prayerbook; witness said !hat, he had not; Kaine then said that he had
one himself, and -threw it on the ground before the witness, who
stoopedto pick itup; that while stooping, Kaine fired one of the
pistols at him, and that on examining his person he found marks
bf a bullet and twenty-seven shot in his side, just under his left
avn; that he then fled, and that Kaine pursued him some distaric, but finally turned back, and witness saw no more of him.'
"Upon this information the said Feathers tonhaugh, justice of
the peace for the county of Westmeath, granted his warrant,
for the apprehension of Thomas Kaine, the prisoner, upon complaint on oath, made before him, that the prisoner had felonioutly and maliciously fired. a pistoli loaded with powder and

lead at the said James Balfe, with intent to murder him. This
warrant, dated April 5, 1851, was immediately put -into the
hands of one Martin Meagher, constable of Westmeath, who
made search for the prisoner and was unable to find him, or to
execute the warrant.- The said Meagher was produced before
me, as a witness, and testified, among other things, that he was
acting constable of the Irish constabulary, of the eounty of
Westmeath, in Ireland, and had been such constable for several
years; that he knew Thomas Kaine, the prisoner, and had
known him for three ydars and upwards; that he had received,
as such constable, .the warrant before mentioned, to execute
against the prisoner; that it was the original warrant; that he saw
James Featherstonhaugh, the magistrate, execute it, and that he
knew said Featherstonhaugh to be a justice of the peace of
the county of Westmeath, in Ireland."
The case pres.ented to us shows that the facts here stated are
correctlymade. Nothing is found in the proceedings before us,
from which it appears that our government took any step to aid
the British authorities in arresting and committing Kaine. And
the Attorney-General declined to appear, on the part of the
United States in this court, in opposition to this motion ; nor
did counsel appear on behalf of the British government, the argument before us being on behalf of the fugitive only.
On the foregoing state of facts the question arises, whether
the Uhited States Commissioner had power and jurisdiction to
proceed without the previous authority of his own government.
Several obscurities in our extradition tredties with Great
Britain and France were supposed to require legislatib.i, on the
part of Congress, to secure their due execution, and accordingly
the act of August 12, 1848, was passed. By its provisions, the
Judges of the Supreme Court, and those of the District courts
of the United States, the Judges of the several State courts,
and also Commissioners appointed for the purpose by any of the
courts of the United States, are severally yested with power
and jurisdiction to act, on complaint made under oath, charging
a person with having committed any of the crimes enumerated
within the foreign jurisdiction; and to issue a warrant for the
apprehension of the person charged, so that he may be brought
befbre such Judge or Commissioner, to the end that the evidence
of criminality may be heard and considered; and if it be
deemed sufficient to sustain the charge, under the provisions of
the treaty, then it is made the duty of the Judge or Commissioner, to certify the fact of sufficiency, together with a copy of
all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State,
so that a warrant may issue by the Executive, on the reqtuisition of the foreign government, through its proper authorities,
VOL. XIV.

110

SUPREME COURT.
In re Kaine.

for the surrender of the fugitives. And the person charged
shall be committed to jail, and there remain under the wariant of the Judge or Commissioner until the surrender shall be
made.
That an Executive order of surrender to a foreign government
is purely a national act, is not open to controversy; nor can it
be doubted that this executive act must be performed through
the Secretary of State by order of our Clief Magistrate representing this nation. But it does not follow that Congress is
excluded from vesting authority in judicial magistrates to arrest
and commit, preparatory to a surrender.
The treaty with Great Britain is equally binding on us as the
act, of Congress, and it likewise confers jurisdiction and authority on the judges and magistrates of the respective governments, to issue warrants for the apprehension' of fugitives; and
for hearing and considering the evidence produced against them;
and also provides, that the committing magistrate shall certify
as to the sufficiency of the evidence, to the executive authority,
so that a warrant of surrender may issue. But we are here
more particularly considering the first and third sections of the
statute; they are merely explanatory of the treaty, and altogether consistent with it. Congress was scrupulously careful,
neither to limit or extend the treaty stipulations. According to
the terms of the statute, no doubt is entertained by me, that the
judicial magistrates of the United States, designated by the act,
are required to issue warrants and cause arrests to be made, at
the instance of the foreign government, on proof of criminality,
as in ordinary cases when crimes are committed within our
own jurisdiction, and punishable by the laws of the United
States.
But it is insisted that, as these acts, in cases of fugitives,
must be done in conformity to a treaty of one nation with
another, and as. a nation can only act through the supreme
Executive authority, representing the nation, the Judges and
Commissioners have no power to take the first step without being- authorized to do so by the President, who represents the
nation; and that the agents of the foreign nation have no right
to call on our judicial officers to act, in advance of authority
from the President.
On the other hand, it is supposed that the judicial magistrate
proceeds in obedience to the treaty and act of Congress, by
which he is invested with power to determine, independent of
the President's commands, on the authority of those who apply
to prosecute the fugitive; and that he must decide for himself,
before the warrant issues, whether the prosecutor has the authority of his nation to demand the warrant, either from official

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.
In re Kaine.

station, or by special deputation, in some satisfactory form, so
that oppression of the party accused will be avoided.
That the British Consul in this instance had the authority of
his government to demand the arrest and commitment, cannot
be doubted; nor that the British government was, and now is,
seeking the surrender.
Two acts of Parliament have been passed to carry the treaty
of 1842 into effect in the British dominions; one in 1843, and
the other in 1845; the authority of which is invoked as expressing the true construction of the treaty. They require one of
the principal secretaries of state in England, if the fugitive is
found in England, or the chief Secretary of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, if the fugitive is found there, or if found in a
colony abroad, the officer administering the government of the
colony, to signify that the requisition has been made, and to
require all magistrates and officers of justice within the jurisdiction where the requisition is made, to aid in apprehending
the person accused, and committing him for the purpose of
being delivered, according to the provisions of the treaty.
The British acts confer authority to arrest and commit, on
judges of courts, and also on justices of the peace, and
inferior police magistrates. Our act of Congress excluded justices of the peace and inferior magistrates, and limits the power
to the Judges of the United States courts, and to Commissioners
appointed for the purpose by them; and to the respective State
Judges. And these, as already declared, are, in my opinion,
authorized to proceed without a previous mandate from the
executive department, Nor can I see any good reason why
it should be otherwise. The judicial magistrate is bound to
decide on the sufficiency of the affidavits on which the warrant
(ifarrest is founded, and compelled to determine on the right to
further prosecute, in every step of the proceeding; and why he
should not have power to decide on the prosecutor's authority
to institute the proceeding, itis difficult to perceive.
The people of this country could hardly be brought to allow
an interference of the President with the Judges in any degree.
The experiment was made during Mr. Adams's administration,
in 1799, and signally failed. Jonathan (or Nathan) Robbins
had been arrested as a fugitive, under the 27th article of Jay's
treaty, for murder in the British fleet. He was imprisoned at
Charleston under a warrant of the District Judge of South
Carolina, and.had been confined six months, when the Secretary
of State addressed a letter to- the Judge, mentioning that application had been made by the British Minister to the President,
for the delivery of Robbins, according to the treaty. The letter
said- " The President advises and requests you to deliver him

112

SUPREME COURT.
In re Kaine.

up." On this authority the prisoner was brought before the
District Court on habeas corpus, and his case fairly enough
heard, to all appearance, from the accounts we now have of it;
and the Judge ordered the surrender in'the following terms:
"I do therefore order and command the marshal, in whose custody the prisoner now is, to deliver the body of said Nathan
IRobbins, alias Thomas Nash, t'o the British Consul, or such person or persons as he shall appoint to receive him."
The prisoner was accordingly delivered to a detachment of
federal troops statioiied there, to.aid in the surrender; and they
delivered him to an officer of the British navy, who was ready
to receive him on board of a vessel of war, in which he was
carried away.
That the Judge-acted by order of the President, and in aid of
the executive department, was never disputed; and the then
administration was defended on the ground that the treaty was
a compact between nations, and might be executed by the President throughout; and must be thus executed by him, until
Congress vested the courts or judges with power to act in the
matter; which had not been done in that instance. 5 Pet. Ap.
19; 7 Am. Law Jour. 13.
The subject was brought to the notice of the House of, Representatives in Congress, by resolutions impeaching the President's conduct in Robbins's case, and where Mr. Marshall (afterwards Chief Justice of this court) made a speech in defence
of the President's course, having much celebrity then and since,
for its ability and astuteness. But a great majority of the
people of this country were opposed to the doctrine that the
President could arrest, imprison, and surrender, a fugitive, and
thereby execute the treaty himself; and they were still more
opposed to an assumption that he could order the courts of justice to execute his mandate, as this would destroy the independence of the judiciary, in cases of extradition, and which
example might be made a precedent for similar invasions in
other cases; and from that day to this, the judicial power has
acted in-cases of extradition, and all others, independent of executive control.
That the eventful history of Robbins's case had a controlling
influence on our .distinguished negotiator, when the treaty of
1842 was made; and especially on Congress, when it passed
the act of 1848, is, as I suppose, free from doul -. The asstamption of power to arrest, imprison, and extrude, on executive warrants, and the employment of a judicial magistrate to act in
obedience to the President's commands, where no independence
existed, or could exist, had most materially aided to overthrow
the administration of a distinguished revolutionary patriot,

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

113

In re Kaine.

whose honesty of purpose no fair-minded man at this day doubts.
Public opinion had settled down to a firm resolve, long before
the treaty of 1842 was made, that so dangerous an engine of
oppression as secret proceedings before the executive, and the
issuing of secret warrants of arrest, founded on them, and long
imprisonments inflicted under such warrants, and then, an extradition without an unbiased hearing before an independent
judiciary, were highly dangerous to liberty, and ought never to
be allowed in this country. Congress obviously proceeded on
this public opinion, when the act of 1848 was passed, and therefore rel'erred foreign powers to the judiciary when seeking to obtain the warrant, and secure the commitment of the fugitive;
and which judicial proceeding was intended to be independent
of executive control, and in advance of executive action on the
case. And such has been the construction, and consequent
practice, under the act of Congress and treaty by our executive department, as we are informed, on application to that department. What aid the executive will afford to a foreign government through its prosecuting attorneys, in cases arising
under treaties, rests with itself, and not with us, as it acts altogether
independent
the judiciary.
In my
judgment, of
the law is as it should be. The treaty of
1842 settled the dividing line of jurisdiction between the United
States and the British possessions in America, from the Atlantic ocean to the Rocky Mountains. On either side of the line,
in great part, there is an extensive population; escapes of criminals from the jurisdiction where the crime was committed, to
the other, must often occur; and if criminals are taken at all,
they must be arrested in hot pursuit, when fleeing from justice.
To do so, a magistrate must be at hand to issue the warrant,
cause the arrest, and adjudge the criminality. If Congress had
delared that the President should first be applied to through the
British Minister, and then issue his mandate to the judges to
proceed in each case, the treaty would become nugatory in most
instances ; and in the entire range of country -west of the Rocky
Mountains, and for more than five hundred miles on this side
of it, throughout the great western plains, no arrests could be
made, nor would they be attempted.
What Great Britain has done by its legislation, cannot control our decision; we must abide by our own laws. If theirs
are inconvenient, or supposed to violate the spirit of the treaty,
it is the duty of our government to complain, and ask that they
be reformed.
There is another striking consideration that must have had
weight with our government, when the act of 1848 was passed.
Judges and State magistrates arrest and commit our own citi100

zens, without exception, in all instances, and for every grade of
crime and offence against our State and Federal laws; they determine on the rights of the prosecutor to commence the proceeding; on the sufficiervcy of the affidavit on which the warrant
of arrest is founded; on the evidence of criminality after the
arrest is made; and imprison or take bail preparatory to a trial
in court. Of this there is no complaint, nor any supposed danger. of oppression, as the writ of habeas corpus promptly corrects
all irregularities. Why, then, should a. foreign criminal be
more tenderly dealt by? He, too, has every benefit of the writ
of habeas corpus; and furthermore can only be arrested by the
authority of his own government; whereas, our citizens can be
arrested at the instance of any person making the proper affidavit that the crime had been committed within our jurisdiction.
This country is open to all men who wish to come to it. No
question, or demand of a passport meets them at the border. He
who flees from crimes committed in other countries, like all
others, is admitted; nor can the common thief be reclaimed by
any foreign power. To this effect we have no treaty. But it
is certainly due to our own citizens that they should be protected against murderers, and those who attempt to ! urder;
and against pirates, house-burners, robbers, and forgers. That
these should be extruded, on the demands of a foreign government where the crime was committed, a id there punished, is
due to humanity. Such wicked and dangerous men ought-not
to remain here. The case before us furnishes a striking instance
of our dangerous condition in this respect. The prisoner successfully resisted and evaded execution of process on him by
the civil authority in England, to which .iefled from h'eland,
for nearly a year, and in various instances, as the official returns
on the origfinal warrant show. And when the Circuit Court
heard his case, the Judge tells us that it.
was to be deplored
that, during the argument the manifestations by the crowd
thronging the court, to r'esist the detention of the prisoner,
should be such that the marshal reported to the court he could
not venture to remove him from the prison, in obedience to the
writ, without an armed force; and therefore his case was heard,
from necessity, in the prisoner's absence, fo: fear "that he would
be rescued from the custody of the law by a mob."
It also appears, that when the warrant of the Secretary of
State was delivered to the British consul and agent, he had to
delay, and could not ship the prisoner, "on account of the expressed belief of the marshal, of the necessity of an armed, or
powerful police force, to counteract outward excitement and
threats of rescue."
This case is embarrassed with some other considerations. It

is urged that the Commissioner who committed Kaine had no
power, because he had not been specially appointed for that
purpose. The Circuit Court held, that the order of appointrent covered the case of fugitives. That the order conferred
on this special magistrate authority to commit in all other erininal cases, to the full extent that the United States Judges
have authority, is admitted; and that he was a magistrate of
the United States government, within the direct term of the
treaty, cannot be denied, as I think. If there was a doubt,
however, as to the meaning of the order of appointment, it was
quite easy to remedy the defect in several ways. The order
might have been amended, and a new commitment made, as
one of the clerks of the Federal Court at New York was acting
as Commissioner; or either of the Judges might have committed
the defendant in the exercise of the original jurisdiction. But
the Circuit Cdurt has construed its own order, nor will I interfere with that construction.
It is proper, however, to. say, that Commissioners, acting under orders of appointment, couched in general terms, as this is,
in its concluding part, have executed the act of 1848, without
any one supposing they wanted power, until now; nor has any
special appointment been made, to the mere end of executing
the act, by any court of the United States, so far as I know. I
feel quite safe in saying, that it has not been done in any judicial circuit in the United States.
The proof that Kaine shot Balfe, with an intent to commit
murder, is conclusive, beyond controversy, if competent; and
the only question that can arise on the merit, is, whether the
copy of Balfe's deposition, received by Commissioner Bridgham,
was admissible.
It is objected, "that there was no evidence what the authority
of the foreign magistrate was; whether to issue warrants, or
to take cognizance of offences, and of what grade of offences."
The Commissioner held, that it was not necessary to produce
the commission under which the Irish magistrate held office,
and acted, nor to prove its contents, proof that he publicly
discharged the duties being prind facie evidence of his official
character; the presumption being, that if a man regularly acts
in a public office, he has been rightfully appointed. Meagher
proves that the Irish magistrate thus acted, and his proof is fore
tiffed by the original warrant produced by him. It is official
and authentic on its face.
There was sufficient evidence, in my opinion, before the Commissioner, to establish the official character of the magistrate,
before whom Balfe's deposition was taken; and that the copy
proved to be a true copy, by Meagher, was properly received,

under the 2d section of the act of 1848. 'It requires, that copies
shall be certified under the hand of the person issuing the warrant, and proved to be true copies, by the oath of the party producing them. And I think it is doubtful whether Congress did
not mean to say, that the official character of the magistrate
should be primd facie established by the deposition and certificate, without further proof of his authority.
After Kaine had been committed by the Commissioner, the
Circuit Court was applied to, by petitior, for writs of habeas
corpus and certiorari,to bring up the prisoner and proceedings
before that court. The writs were issued, and a very thorough
examination had of the law and the facts. The court decided
that the commitment was, in all respecis, legal and proper, concurred with the Commissioner's decision, and ordered the prisoner to be remanded to the custody of the marshal, under the
commitment of the Commissioner.
The opinion and judgment of the District Judge, who presided, are before us, and form part of the proceedings presented
here; and it is due to that able jurist to sz.y, that he brought to
the consideration of the case a degree of patience, learning,
and capacity rarely met with, and which no other Judge can
disregard without incurring the risk" of error.
After this careful consideration of the case, in open court,
the Circuit Judge granted a second writ zf habeas corpus, and
.thereby stayed the warrant for Kaine's extradition, awarded. by
the Secretary of State, and which had been delivered to the
British authorities; and the rnatter was again brought before
that Judge, at chambers, but not deeming it proper to act, he
adjourned the proceeding, as presented to him, into this court;
and of the case thus presented, we are ctled on to take jurisdiction. Cognizance could only be taken of the matter, on the
assumption that original jurisdiction existed in the Circuit
Judge to act, but on which he did not-act; and the case comes
here as one of original jurisdiction, which we are called on to
exercise; and as the Constitution declares that this court shall,
only have appellate powers, in cases like this, it follows that
the transfer made by the Circuit Judge is of no validity, and
must be rejected. Foreseeing that we might thus hold, the
counsel for the prisoner, Kaine, also moved this court, on petition, with the papers and proceedings presented to the Circuit
Judge annexed thereto, for writs of habeascorpus and certiorari,
to bring up the defendant, and the record from the Circuit
Court, to the end of having the decision of that court examined
here.
The case has been carefully and ably argued before us, on
behalf of the prisoner; and anxiously considered by this court,

on every gound presented, and especially on its merits; and I
am authorized to say, that Judges McLean, Wayne, and Grier,
agree with the views above given, and that we refuse the motion for the writ, on the merits. We are not disposed, under
the circumstances, to exercise the jurisdiction of this court in
the ease.
Mr. Justice CURTIS.
To state intelligibly the grounds on which I rest my judgment
in this case,\it is necessary to advert to the proceedings by
means of which it comes before us.
On the 14th day of June, 1852, a complaint, on oath, was
presented to Joseph Bridgham, Esq., one of the commissioners
to take affidavits, &c., appointed by the Circuit Court of the
United States, in the Southern District of New York, charging,
that Thomas Kaine, in that part of the dominions of Her Britannic Majesty, called Ireland, had feloniously assaulted one John
Balfe, and inflicted upon him a wound with a pistol, with intent
to murder him; that a warrant to arrest- Kaine, for this felony,
was issued by a justice of the peace,'duly authorized for this
purpose, but. Kaine having fled from justice, took refuge in the
United States, and was then in the Southern District of New
York; and the complainant, who describes himself as the Consul
of Her Britannic Mlajesty in New York, prays that a" warrant
may be issued to apprehend Kaine, to the end that such pro,eedings may take place for his surrender to the authorities of
Great Britain, as are required by the treaty between the United
States and Great Britain, and the act of Congress, passed' to
carry that treaty into effect.
A warrant did issue, Kaine was arrested, and a hearing took
place, the result of which was, that the .Commissioner ordered
Kaine to be committed, pursuant to the treaty, to abide the
order of the President of the United States, in the premises.
In this stage of the proceedings, a writ of habeas corpus was
issued by the Circuit Coiirt of the United States, for the Southern District of New York. Kaine was brought before that
court, in whicif the District Judge then presided, and after a
hearing, upon all the objections raised by the Prisoner, the
writ of habeas corpus was dismissed, and Kaine was remanded
and continued in the custody of the marshal, under his arfest
and commitment by the process of the Commissioner. On the
22d day of July, 1852, Kaine presented to Mr. Justice Nelson,
at chambers, a petition addressed to the Justices of the Supreme
Court of-the United States, in which he sets forth, that he is
detained in custody by an .order made by Judge Betts, on the
9th day of July, 1852, that his detention is illegal, and prayifig

for a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of his cornmintment.
Upon this petition, Mr. Justice Nelson made an order, under
,which a writ issued, which is as follows:

States Marshal for the Southern District

our Supreme Co- -- of the United States. at his chambers, in
Cooperstown, New York, on the 11th day of August, instant,
to do and receive what shall then and there be considered, concerning the said Thomas Kaine.
Witness, SAMUEL NELSON, Esq., one of our Justices of our
said Court, this third day of July, eighteen hundred and fifty-two.
RICHARD BUSTEED, AtIoi'ney for petitioner.
Upon the return of the marshal to this writ, a hearing was
had, which resulted in the following order, made by Mr. Justice
Nelson:
CooPERSTOWN, August 11, 1852. At Charbers.
The marshal having made the within return, Ordered, that in
consequence of the difficult and important questions involved in
the case, it be heard before all the Justices of the Supreme
Court, in bank, at the commencement of the next term thereof;
and that, in the mean time, the prisoner remain in the custodk
of the said marshal.
S. NELSON.
These are the proceedings which have brought this case here,
and the first question which arises is, whether, under these proceedings, we have any power to act?
In my opinion, "we have hot. Passing over the question,
whether the court itself could rightfully issue a writ of habeas
corpas upon the case made before Mr. J=tice Nelson, which I
shall consider hereafter, I think a Judge of the court in vacation, at his chambers, has no :power to grant a writ of habeas
corpus out of this court, or to make suc'* a writ returnable
before himself, and then adjourn it irito t rm; and, that if he
had such power, it has not been exerted in this case, the writ
"actually issued not being a writ out of this court, or upon
which, as process, this coult can take any action.
It-is not to be doubted, that whatever j .risdiction belongs to
the. Supreme Court, under any writ of hab -as corpus ad subjici-

endure, is appellate. It is equally clear that no part of the appellate jurisdiction of this court can be exercised by a single
Judge, at his chambers. It is also well.settled, that the question,
whether such a writ of habeas corpus shall issue from this court,
is one upon which the court ought to pass, before the writ issues;
the allowance of the writ being an exercise of its limited appellate jurisdiction, which only the court itself has the power to
exert. Ex parte Milburn, 9 Peters, 704.
From these premises it also follows, that if such a writ be
issued from this court, it cannot be made returnable before a
Judge, at chambers, for the reason, that he cannot there exercise
any appellate power under it. And, finally, this writ does not
bear the seal of the Supreme Court, is not tested by the Chief
Justice, or signed by the clerk, as is required by the act of
Congress, (1 Stat. at Large, 93,) but bears the seal of the Circuit Court of the Southern District of New York, is tested by
Mr. Justice Nelson, is not signed by any clerk, and therefore cannot be 6onsidered process issuing out of this court, or
upon which we can take jurisdiction.
I concur with iny brethren in the opinion, that under this
writ the court can pass no order whatever.
It remains to consider the application made by the counsel
of Kaine, to have another writ of habeas -corpus allowed by this
court.
The first question is, whether we have jurisdiction to act under the writ, if allowed in the case shown by the petitioner.
There are some principles, bearing on this question, which are
settled. That this court has no original jurisdiction to issue a
writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendunt, and can grant such a
writ only in the exercise of its appellate jurisdibtion, and consequently, by means of it, can revise only the proceedings of
those tribunals over which, and in respect to which, ithas an
appellate control, have been so repeatedly and uniformly decided
here, that they must be considered as finally settled. Marbury
v. Madison, 1 Cr. 175; Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cr. 100, 101; Ex
parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 33; Ex parte 'Watkins, 3 Peters, 193,
S. C. 7 Peters, 568 ; Cohens v. State of Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264;
Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738; Ex parte
Madraza, 7 Peters, 627; Ex -parte Barry, 2 Howard, 6-5. That
no such control, by means of an appeal, writ of error, or other
proceeding, can be exercised by this court over a Commissioner,
dcting under the authority of an act of Congress, or under color
of such an authority, and that this court has no power in any
way to revise his proceedings, I consi .er equally clear. In Ex
parte Metzger, (5 Howard, 176,) it was determined that a writ of
habeas coipus could not be allowed, to examine a commitrment

120

In re Kaine.

-by d District Judge, at chambers, under the treaty between the
United States and France, for the reason that the Judge, in
ordering the commitment, exercised a special authority, and
the law had made no provision for the revision of his judgment. The same reason applies to the action of this Commissioner. Not only has the law made no provision for The revision
of his acts by this court, but, strictly speaking, he does not
exercise any part of the.judicial power of the United States.
That power can be exerted only by Judges, appointed by the
Presiden't, with the consent of the Senate, holding their offices
-during good behavior, and receiving fixed salaries. (Constitution,
art. 3, sec. 1.) The language of Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in
United States v. Ferreira, (13 Howard, 48,) in speaking of the
powers exercised by a District Judge, and the Secretary of the
Treasury, under the treaty with Spain, of 1819, describes correctly, the nature of the authority of such a Commissioner as
acted in the case before us. " The powers conferred by Congress upon the Judge, as
as the Secretary, are, it is true,
judicial in their nature. Fov judgment and discretion must
be exercised by both of-them. Bttt it is not judicial, in either
case, in the sense in which judicial powar is granted by the
Constitution to the courts of the United States."
Since, then, the Commissioner did not, in this case, exercise
any part of ie judicial power of the United States, and no
mode has been provided by law to transfer the case on which
he acted into any court of the United States, and thus bring
that case under the judicial power, this court can have no appellate control over it; because its appellate power cannot extend
beyond the 6ction of the inferior' courts, established by Congress
to take. original jurisdictionunder the Constitution, and which
exercise judicial power therein conferred. As it is plain, then,
that to revise the proceedings of the Commissioner by a writ of
habeas corpus, would be an exercise of original, and not of
appellate jurisdiction, the inquiry recurs whether we can grant
the writ for the purpose of revising the decision "ofthe Circuit
Court, made upon the writ of habeas corpus issued by that
court.
This. court has appellate power only in the cases provided for
by Congress. United States v. Moore, 3 Cr. 159; Durousseau
v. United States, 6 Cr. 307.
We fust therefore find,,in some act of Congress, power to
review the decision of A circuit court simply remanding a
prisoner on a writ of habeas corpus; otherwise this writ cannot
be allowed. The only grant of power, supposed to be applicable to such a case, is contained in the fourteenth section of the
Judiciary Act, (1 Stat. at Large, 81,) which authorizes this

court to issue writs of habeas corpus; and the question ig4
ic
whether a grant of power to issue a writ of habeas corpus "t
examine into the cause of commitmen't," is a grant of power to
review this particular decision of the Circuit Court.
As the only jurisdiction conferred. arises from the authority
to issue the writ, and the consequent authority to proceed under
it, the exigency of the writ must necessarily limit, the jurisdiction. So far as the subject-matter involved in this writ extends.
the jurisdiction exists, and no further.
That subject-matter is "tile cause of the commitment." So
that we must ascertain whether the decision of ihe Circuit
Court is the cause of the commitment. If it is, we have jurisdiction to inquire into it; if it is not,-then that decision is not
within the exigency of this writ, forms no part of its subjectmatter, and is lot within our appellate control.
To determine whether the decision of the Circuit Court is
the cause of the commitment in this case, it is necessary to
have distinctly before us the precise acts which have been done,'
and then to consider their legal effect.
On the 29th day of June, 1852, the Commissioner, after the
previous proceedings which have been mentioned, made the
following warrant to the Marshal of the Southern District of
New York:
UNITED STATES OF AMIERICA,

Southem District of New York, ss.
In the matter of Tbomas Kame.
This case having been heard before me, on requisition,
through Anthony Barclay, Esquire, Her Britannic Majesty's
Consul at the Port of New York, that the said Kaine be committed for the purpose of being delivered up as a fugitive from
justice, pursuant to the provisions -of the treaty made between
the United States and Great Britain, August9fh, 1842, I find
and adjudge that the evidence produced against the said Kaine,
is insutficient inlaw to justiky his commitment on the charge
of assault with intent to commit murder, had the crime been
committed within the United States. Wherefore, I order that
the said Thomas Kaine be committed, pursuant to the provisions of the said treaty, to abide the order of the President of
the United States in the premises.

re Kaine.

TUnder this warrant Kaine was held by the marshal, at the
time the writ of Iabeas corpus was issued by ttio Circuit Court;
and upon the return of that writ, several questions of law were
raised and argued, touching the jurisdiction of the Commissioner, and the regularity and validity of his proceedings; and
on the 9th day of July, 1852, the Circuit Court gave its decision,
to the effect that the Commissioner had jurisdiction, and had
proceeded regularly, and concluded by passing the following
order:
" The court accordingly adjudges that "2he commitment and
imprisonment of the prisoner for the causes in the return to the
habeas corpus in the case set forth, are sufficient cause and warrant in law for his detention by the marshal.
" Therefore, it is ordered by the court, that the writ of habeas
corpus allowed in this case be dismissed, and that the prisoner
be remanded and continued in the custody of the marshal,
under such his arrest and commitment by the aforesaid p 'ocess."
Is this order "the cause of the commitment" of Kaine
within the meaning of a writ of habeas corpus ? With the
utmost respect for the opinions of those of my brethren who
have so considered it, I cannot come to that conclusion. It
seems to me, that it is not the cause of the commitment; either
in substance or in form.
In substance, it is merely a refusal to discharge the prisoner from an existing commitment, because the cause of that
existing commitment is found sufficient in law. It creates
no new cause; it simply declares the existing cause to be
sufficient. It makes no new commitment, and issues no new
process as an instrument for it, but only pronounces the
old process valid, and consequently the continuance of the
commitment under it legal.. The custody was at no time
changed. Certainly, when a prisoner is brought into court
upon the return of a habeas corpus ad subjiciendum, he is
then in the power and under the control of the court; but
until the court makes .some order changing the custody, it
remains. The court may, in some cases, admit to bail, and
may also take order for the future production of the prison.
er, without bail; but in all cases, until the court makes some
order changing the custody, either for the care or security
of -the prisoner, or founded on the illegality of his commitment, the original custody continues. 'In this case, no such
order was made.
If, then, this order of the Circuit Court created no new cause
of commitment, made no new commitment, and only pro-

nounced the existing cause sufficient,, and the existing custody
lawful, I cannot perceive how that order can, in substance, be
treated as the cause of the commitment of Kaine.
Nor, in my apprehension, is it so, even in form. In form, the
couit first adjudges that the causes set forth in the return, are
sufficient, and, "therefore, -t is ordered, by the court, that the
writ of habeas corpus allowed in this case, be dismissed, and
that the prisoner be remanded, and continued in the custody of
the marshal, under such his arrest and commitment by the
aforesaid process."
This clearly expresses, in words, precisely what would be the
legal effect of dismissing the -writ of habeas corpus, without
those words. And I do not perceive how it can be more plainly
expressed than by the language of this order, that the process
of the Commissioner, being found sufficient, the commitment
by that process is not interfered with.
It is true, the order contained the word, remanded, but in the
context, where it stands, it means only that the command of the
writ is no longer operative, and that the court would 6xercise
no further control over the body of the prisoner, and not that,
being out of the custody of the marshal, he is recomnitted to
him anew, for the words are "remanded and, continued in the.
custody of the marshal, under such his arrest and commitment
by the aforesaid process."
In point of form, the same order would have been passed i
it had been found by the Circuit Court, on the return of the
writ, that the prisoner was not held under, or by color of the
authority of the United States, and therefore that, under the
Judiciary Act, the court had no .power to relieve him by
habeas corpus. It could not be contended that, dfter such
an order, the prisoner was confined by order of the Circuit
Court, and that its order was the cause of his commitment, yet
in such a case the writ must'have been dismissed, and the
,prisoner remanded.
But -whatever literal interpretation might be put upon the
precise words. employed in the order, I should be unable to find
"the cause of the commitment" in an act of the court dismissing a writ of habeas corpus; because the cause of the commitment shown by the -eturn is found sufficient. 'The cause of
the commitment is to be looked for in the warrant under which
it began, and has been continued, and not in the decision of a
court pronouncing that warrant !alid.
I have thus far considered this question of jurisdietion upon
those principles which seem to me applicable to it. It remains
to examine the former decisions of this court, to ascertain
whether the question is determined by authority.

SUPREME. COURT.
In re Kaine.

There are two cases which have been chiefly relied on at the
bar. The first is Ex parte Burford, 3 Cr. 448. As this case
has many facts in common with the case at bar, it is necessary
carefully to examine it. Without detailing the preliminary proceedings, it will, be sufficient to say, that 'Burford was committed .to the jail of the county of Washington, in the District of
Columbia, hy a warrant of certain justices of the peace, which
was defective,.-because it did not state "some good cause certain, supported by oath." That he was brought before the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, upon a writ of habeas
coTpus, and, after a hearing, that court passed the following
order, which, as it is, not given in the report of the case by
Judge Cranch, and as its terms seem to rne to be important, I
have procured from the original record in this court.
"January 8th, 1806. John A. Burford was brought into court
by the Marshal of the District/ of Columbia, agreeably to the
habeas corpus issued by this court, on the 4th instant, with the
cauie of his commitment annexed thereto, (which habeas corpus
and cause of commitment are hereunto annexed,) whereupon,
all and siligular the premises being heard, and by the court have
been fully understood, the court order, that,the said John A. Bur'ford, enter into a recognizance, himself in $1,000, and one or
more sureties, in the like sum, for his goad behavior for one
year from this day, and that he be remanded to jail, there to
remain until such recognizance be entered into."
This case is relied upon as a decision to show, that although
this court cannot, as was held in Metzger's case, issue a writ of
habeas corpus to examine the validity of thd warrant of the
Commissioner; yet, if the Circuit Court has, by such a writ,
examined its validity, pronounced it valid, and therefore dismissed the writ, and ordered the prisoner to be continued in the
custody of the marshal, this court may, upon a writ of habeas
corpus, examine that decision, and reverse it, if found erroneous
Before "considering whether the decision in Burford's case,
goes this length, I think it consistent with the profoundest respect for the very eminent judges who sat in that case, to say,
that it does not appear that th question now made, n as by
them examined and considered, or that they themselves ,vould
have deemed- it foreclosed by that decision. Indeed, that they
w6uld not have so considered, seems to me from the fact that,
at the term of'thd court following this decision, wben a writ of
habeas corpus was moved for, to bring up the body of James
Alexander, Marshall, C. J., said:- " The whole subject will be
taken up de novo, 'without reference to Frecedents. It is the
wish of this court to have the motion made in a more solemn
inanner to-morrow, when you may dome prepared to take up

the whole ground." 4 Cr. 75, note. Further proceedings upon
this motion became unnecessary, in consequence of the discharge of the prisoner by another tribunal; but a few days after,
upon motions in behalf of Bolhman and Swartwout, committed
by the Circuit Court under a charge of treason, the court proceeded to hear arguments upon its jurisdiction to issue the
writs, and in an elaborate judgment affirmed the jurisdiction
to examine a cause of commitment by the Circuit Court. I
cannot doubt, therefore, that if at that time the further question
had ariser whether the court had also jurisdiction to examine
a cause of commitment by a Commissioner, after the Circuit
Court had reviewed that cause, and pronounced it sufficient, the
court would have thought it necessary to consider that question
also de noro, upon all its grounds, and would not have treated
Burford's case as a sufficient basis on which to rest their decision. But, as I understand Burford's case, it is clearly distin.
guishable from the case at bar. The Circuit Court, in that
case, did not dismiss the writ of habeas coipus; they made an
order under it, to imprison Burford. That order was,.tha. he
be remanded to jail, there to remain until he should enter into
a recognizance, with surety, in the sum of $1000, for his good
behavior for one year. This order was the cause of commitment, and under this order he was held when the -writ of habeas
corpvs issued from this court. It necessarily superseded the
order n-iade by the justices .of the peace, which was, that Burford should be imprisoned until he should recognize in the sumrn
of $4000, with surety, to be of good behavior indefinitely.
It is true the Circuit Court did not proceed de nero, and thaT
for this reason their order was held invalid. But the question
of jurisdiction did not depend upon the validity of the order, or
the causes of its invalidity, but simply upon the fact that the
Circuit Court caused the commitment; and when it issued an
order, complete in itself, that Burford should be imprisoned, and
by that order superseded the former order of the Justices, the
Circuit Court did an act which caused his commitment, and
this court might inquire, by a writ of habeas corpus, into its
validity. The !distinction between such a case, and one where
the Circuit Court merely dismissed the writ of habeas corpus,
is to my mind clear.
And it must be observed that the question now is, not whether
this court treated the act of the Circuit Court as the cause of
cowtmmitment. I have no doubt they did so treat it, and it
seems to have been so considered in subsequent cases. In Ex
parte Watldns, (7 Peters, 573,) Mr. Justice Story, in reviewing the
cases on the subject of habeas corpus, says -"In Ex parte Burford, the prisoner was in custody under a commitment by the
11*

SUPREME COURT.
In re Kaine.

Circuit Court, for want of giving a recognizance for his good
behavior, as awarded by the court." So in Metzger's case, (5
How. 189,) Mr. Justice McLean says :-" Ex paste Burford was
a habeas corpus, on which the prisoner, who had been com.
mitted by the Circuit Court in this district, was discharged,
there being no sufficient cause for the commitment."
It is undoubtedly true, that the imprisonment of Burford was
considered to be under a commitment by the Circuit Court, and
the case is an authority to prove that when a writ of habeas
corpus is returned in the Circuit Court, and that court makes an
order imprisoning the party, this court may review that order.
But it is not, in my judgment, an authority to show that the
Circuit Court of the Southern District of New York did make
an order imprisoning Kaine. In Burford's case, the court did
not dismiss the writ, nor refuse to discharge the prisoner from
the commitment by the Justices, but madE an order which constituted a new cause of commitment, and superseded the existing cause. In Kaine's case, the Circuit Court held the existing
cause to be sufficient, and refused to interfere with it. In my
judgment, these cases are not parallel.
Nor do I consider'the case Ex parte Watkins, (7 Pet. 572,) to
be an authority that jurisdiction exists in this case. It is only
necessary to quote a single passage, from the opinion of the
court, to show that it cannot aid in solving the question which
I am now cofiidering. " The award of the capias ad satisfaciendurn, must be considered as the act of the Circuit Court, it
being judicial process issuing under the authority of the court.
The party is in custody under that process. He is then in
custody in contemplation of law, under the award of process by
the court."
It is -upon this ground the decision is rested, and I can find
nothing in it tending to show that in the case at bar the act of
the Circuit Court is the cause of commitment.
I shall not particularly examine the other decisions of this
court, which are still more remote from the case at bar.
My opinion is, that the cause of commitment of Kaine is not
the act of the Circuit Court, but of the Commissioner, and for
this reason the writ must ,be refused.
But there is another ground, on which this refusal may be
rested.. The decision.of the Circuit Court was made on the 9th
day of July. On the 17th day of July, a warrant was issued
from the Department of State, which was in the following
words:

To all whom these presents shall come, greeting:Whereas, John F. Crampton, Envoy Extraordinary and

In re Kaine.

Minister Plenipotentiary to Her Majesty the Queen of Great
Britain and Ireland, hath made requisition, in conformity with
the 10th article of the treaty between the United Statbs and
Great Britain, for the mutual surrender of fugitive criminals,
concluded at Washington, the 9th day of August, 1842, for the
delivery up to justice of Thomas Kaine, charged with the erme
of assault with an intent to commit murder, in the county of
*Vestmneath, Ireland.
And whereas, the said Thomas Kaine hath been found in the
State of New York, within the jurisdiction of the United
States, and has, by proper affidavit, and in due form, been
brought before Joseph Bridgham, a Commissioner duly appointed by the United States Circuit Court for the Southern
District of New York, in the second circuit, for examination
of said charge of assault with intent to commit murder. And
wvhereas, the said Commissioner hath deemed the evidence sufficient to authorize the commitment of said Thomas. Kaine, and
has, accordingly, committed him. All of which appears by a
copy of the proceedings transmitted to this department.
Now, these presents are to require of the United States Marshal for the -Southern District of New York, or of any other
public officer or person having charge or custody of said Thomas
Kaine, to surrender and deliver him up to Anthony Barclay, Her
Britannic Majesty's Consul at the Port of New York, or to any
other person or persons duly authorized to receive said fugitive,
and conduct him to Great Britain for trial.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto signed my name, and
caused the seal of this Department to be affixed, at Washington, this 17th day of July, A. D. 1852, and of the independence
of the United States the seventy-seventh.

W. HUNTER,
Actbg" Secretary of State.
Upon its face, this warrant is perfectly regular. Its recitals
set forth every fact necessary to warrant the act of extradition,
according to the treaty and the act of Congress. It appears, by
the return of the marshal upon the writ issued by Mr. Justice
Nelson, that before he received that writ, this warrant had come
to his hands, and he had, in obedience to it, tendered Kaine to"
Anthony Barclay, who expressed his readiness to receive him;
and while arrangements were about to be made to put Kaine
on shipboard, the writ of habeas corpus, issued by Mr. Justice
Nelson; suspended the further execution of the warrant of extradition.
This warrant of extradition is the final process under the
treaty and act of Congress. When it comes to the hands of

SUPREM1E COURT.
In re Kaine.

the marshal, he holds the prisoner for the purpose of executing
it. Upon this process, therefore, Kaine is now held.
The act of Congress requires the Judge, or Commissioiter, to
certify to the Secretary of State his ;inding, together with a
copy of all the testimony taken before him, that a warrant may
issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of the
foreign government for the surrender of th3 fugitive, according
to the stipulations of the treaty. Such a warrant having issued,
and its validity not having been considered by any court of original jurisdiction, in my judgment it is not the exercise of an
appellate power to examine its validity by a writ of habeas corpus. It may be true that, if the proceedings before the Comropsioner were to be held void, this warrant must also be
invalid. But the question is not, whether ihis warrant is valid,
but whether we have jurisdiction to examine its validity. It
may also be true that, if this warrant were final process, issued by the Circuit Court, and we had power to examine the
legality of a judgment or order of that cour:, pursuant to which
it issued, we should also have jurisdiction upon a habeas corpus,
to examine the validity of such a warrant, and of the proceedings of executive officers under it. But this warrant did not
emanate from the Circuit Court, nor does it depend, in any
way, upon its authority, nor is it a legal consequence of the
action of the Circuit Court on the writ of habeas corpus, or in
any other proceeding. It emanates from a department of the
executive, which rests its action upon the proceedings of the
Commissioner, and over neither can this court have, under the
Constitution, nor has" it under the laws, any appellate jurisdiction or control. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cr. 137.
For the reasoh, then, that if a writ of habeas corpus were
allowed in this case, the validity of the warrant of extradition
could not be examined here, I think the writ should be refused.
In considering the question, whether the Supreme Court of
the United States has jurisdiction, -under the Constitution and
laws of the United States, to entertain this application, I have
not felt at liberty to allow my judgment to be pressed upon by
the great value of the particular writ applied for, or the propriety and expediency of a power in this court to review the
judgments of the Circuit Courts, in cases affecting the liberty
of the citizen. To all that has been said concerning the preeminent utility of the writ of habeas corpus, I readily assent.
But it must be remembered, that the real question here is not,
whether thiq great writ shall be freely and efficiently used, but
whether our appellate power is large enough to extend to this
case. The Circuit Court has power, upon its own views of the
law, to inflict, not only imprisonment, but even the pumshment

of death, without appellate control by this court. Even when
it is alleged, that the proceedings of a circuit court, by which
judice and void, its judga citizen is imprisoned, are coram noa&
ment is final, and no relief can be had here, by writ of error or
appeal, or by habeas corpus. Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193;
Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38.
Undoubtedly, it would be competent for Congress to do, in
cases like this, what it has done in a class of cases somewhat
analogous. By the act of August 29,1842, (5 Stat. at Large, 539,)
when the subject of a fareign government is imprisoned for an
act done under the authority of that government, and a writ of
habeas coarps is issued by a Judge of this court, or by a Distrit
Judge, an appeal to the Circuit Court, and from its order to this
court, is expressly given.
.
It is for Congress to determine, whether this class of cases
requires the same privileges. Until it so determines, I must give
my decision upon our jurisdiction, as, according to my judgment, it exists, unaffected by the consideration, that it might be
expedient to enlarge it. My opinion is that, if the writ prayed
for were issued, we should not have jurisdiction to inquire into
the cause of commitment shown by the petition, an'4 consequently the writ should be refused. I give no opinion upon the
sufficiency of the cause of the commitment, not deeming it to
be judicially before us.
Mr. Justice NELSON.
The application for the arrest and delivery of Thomas Kaine
was originally made on the requisition of the British Consul,
resident at the port of New York, before Joseph Bridgham, Esq.,
a United States Commissioner for the Southern District of New
York. A warrant was issued and the arrest made, and, on the
return before this officer, an examination took place upon a
charge that the fugitive had committed an assault, with intent
to murder, upon one James Balfe, in Ireland, on the 5th April,
1851. The Commissioner, upon hearing the allegation and
proofs, adjudged the prisoner .guilty, and ordered that he be
cormmitted, in pursuance of the treaty, to abide the order of the
President of the United States. A petition was then presented
to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of New York,
holden by the District Judge, for a writ of habeas corpus, directed to the marshal, to bring up the body of the prisoner; and
also a certiorarito the Commissioner, to bring up the proceedings that had taken place before him . and upon a full review of
all these proceedings, on the 9th July, 1852, adjudged that the
pbmmitrnent and detention were for sufficient cause, and ordered
that the writ of habeas corpus be dismissed, and the prisoner be

remanded, and continued in the custody'of the marshal, under
said commitment. On the 17th July, copies of these proceedings having been forwarded to the Department of State, at
Washington, the Acting Secretary issued his warrant to the
marshal having the custody of the prisoner, directing that lie be
surrendered to Mr. Barclay, the British Consul, or to any other
person or persons duly authorized to receive the fugitive and
transport him to Great Britain for trial. On the 22d July, a
petition was presented to me, at my chambers, in Cooperstown,
on behalf of the prisoner, for a writ of habeas corpus, which I
declined allowving until the whole of the proceedings that had
already taken place in the matter were laid before me. Copies
of them were subsequently furnished, and, upon an examination,
being satisfied that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction over
the case, I allowed the writ, on the 3d of August, returnable before me, at my chambers, on the 11th of the same month, and
which return was made accordingly. As the case was one in
which I entertained a different opinion from that of the tribunals before whom the proceedings had taken place, not only as
to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner, but also in respect to
their interpretation of the treaty, and act of Congress passed to
carry it into effect; and, as the questions involved were of considerable interest of themselves, and concerned deeply the two
nations who were parties to the treaty, o~a the return to the
writ I entered an order, directing that the case be heard before
all the Judges, at the commencement of the next term of this
court. The case ha8 now been heard in full bench, and I am
inclined to concur with my brethren, that we cannot entertain
jurisdiction of it upon my allowance of th. writ and adjournment of the proceedings to be heard in this court. The practice is a familiar one, in the proceedings under this writ, before
the King's Bench; in England. I Burr. R. 460, 542, 606;
Comyn's Digest, Habeas Corpus, 3d ed.; B1. Com. 131; 9 Ad. &
Ell. 731, Leonard Watson's case, and which furnished the precedent for that adopted by me in this case. That, however, is an
original proceeding; and, in cases where the court has original
jurisdiction to hear and determine the matters upon the return,
and where the hearing may be had either before one of the
Justices, t chambers, or in full bench. But, according to the
settled course of decisions in this court, we can only issue the
writ, and entertain jurisdiction of the matters set forth on the
return, in the exercise of our appe.ate power. United States

Justices, at chambers, there may be ground for a distinction between the proceedings, under the writ, in this court and in the
King's Bench. The issuing of the writ, and proceedings before
me, at chambers, under it, must undoubtedly be regarded as an
original proceeding, and not in the exercise of an appellate
power. If this conclusion be a sound one, the remedy for the
defect in the law must be sought in Congress, who can
make provision for the issuing of the writ in vacation as well
as in term, in all cases where this court possesses jurisdiction
to entertain proceedings under it. The right of the citizen to
appeal to the court for the benefit of this great writ, in case of
an illegal restraint of his liberty, ought not to be restricted to
the time of its sitting; but, as in all other cases where its jurisdiction may be exercised, provision should be made for instituting the proceeding in vacation. The prisoner has now presented to this court a petition, praying for a writ of habeas corpus to be directed to the marshal, that he may be brought up,
together with the ground of his commitment; and, also, for
a cerliorarito the Circuit Court, to bring up the proceedings
that have taken place in that court, which disembarrasses the
case of all exceptions to the form of the application; and the return of the marshal and the jroceedings before the Circuit
Court being now before us, on this preliminary motion, by the
agreement of the counsel, the case is in a situation to enable us to express an opinion upon the merits. It*is objected,
that this court cannot entertain jurisdiction of the case, even
upon the petition, return of the marshal, and of the proceedings before the Circuit Court to the certiorari,for the reason,
it appears, as supposed, that the prisoner is held in confinement
under the warrant of the Commissioner, and not under the
decision-and order of the Circuit Court; that this court cannot
reach and review the proceedings before the Commisioner, by
virtue of this writ, in the exercise of its appellate power, but
can only reach" "and review the proceedings and order of the
Circuit Court; and, as the confinement of the prisoner is not
under or in pursuance of the order of that court, the proceedings under the -writ here would be a nullity, The first case in
which this question was discussed at large by counsel and by
the court, was&that of Ex parte Bollman and.Swartwout. They
were in confinement in this district, under a warrant from the
Circuit Court, upon a charge of treason against the United
States. Two objections were taken to the power of this court
to issue the writ to bring up the prisoners: 1st, that it involved
the exercise of an original jurisdiction, not given by the Constitution; and, 2d, that, if it was the exercise of an appellate
power, it was not within the 14th section of the Judiciary Act,

SUPREME

COURT.

In re Kaine.

which alone conferred the authority to i sue this writ. Chief
Justice Marshall, who delivered the opinion in that case, admitted the power'could not be exercised as a part of the original jurisdiction of the court; but held, that it possessed jurisdiction, as an appellate power, under this 14th section. After
answering the argument, that the power to award the writ was
limited by that section to causes pending in this court, in which
it was necessary, in order to enable it to make a final decision
in the case, he observed that the proviso to the section extended
to the whole of it; that proviso is as follows:
That writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to
prisoners in jail, unless where they are in custody under or by
color of the authority of the United States, or are committed
for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be
brought into court to testify.
And that, construing the section with reference to this proviso,
the power of the court to issue the Writ e.tended to all cases
where the prisoner was restrained of his liberty, under the authority of the federal government. The same principle is
derived from that section, as stated by Mr. Justice McLean in
Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103-105. "The power given to the courts,"
he observes, " in this section to issde writs of scire facias, habeas
corp s, &c.; as regards the writ of habeas corpus, is restricted by
the proviso to cases where a prisoner is in custody under or by
color of the authority of the United States, or has been committed for trial before some court of the ,ame, or is necessarf
to be brought into court to testify This is so clear," he
observes, "froni the language of the section, that any illus ration
of it would seem to be unnecessary. The words of the proxiso
are unambiguous. They admit of but one construction." If
this construction of the section is to be maintained, (and the case
Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout was very fully and deliberately considered,) then it is manifest the power to issue this great
writ for the security of the liberty of the citizen, is much broader
than has been contended for on behalf of the -prisoner in the
case before us. Hamilton's case, decided ia 1795, led the way
to the decision in Bollman and Swartwout. That case repudiates
the idea, that the power to issue the writ is limited to instances
where the proceeding is ancillary to the determination of a suit
pending. Hamilton was in jail on a warrar..t issued by the District Judge, at chambers, upon a charge of treason. Chief Justice
Marshall, in Ex parte Tobias Watkins, (3 Peters, 208,) observes
that in the case of Boilman and Swartwout, the habeas corpuswas
awarded on the same principle on which it was awarded in Hamilton's case; and, in Ex parte Kearney, Mir. Jastice Story, in stating the points in the case, observes, "the first is whether or not

DECEMBER TERMI, 1852.
In re Kaine.

this court has authority to issue a habeas corpus where a person
is in jail under the warrant or order of any other court of the
United States." And then says, "that it is unnecessary to
say more than that the point has already passed in rem judicatam
in this court. In the case of Bollman and Swartwout, it was expres~ly decided, upon full argument, that this court possessed
such authority, and the question has ever since been considered
at rest." In the case of Ex parte Watkins, reported in 7 Peters,
568, there is a still stronger exercise of the power to issue this
writ. In that case the prisoner was in custody of the marshal
under three executions regularly issued out of the Circuit Court,
but their efficacy had expired by the neglect of the marshal to
bring in the body on the return day. The error or wrongful
detention lay wholly with the marshal, and yet this court issued
the habeas corpus, and discharged the prisoner. The case stands
upon the principle decided in Hamilton's case, and in Bollman
and Swartwout, that the writ may issue in all cases where the
prisoner is in custody under and by color of the authority of the
United States. In the case Ex parte Metzger, the prisoner was
committed to the custody of the marshal by the District Judge,
at his chambers, under the French treaty of extradition. This
court held that they possessed no power to issue the writ of
habeas corpus, inasmuch as the order of commitment had been
made at chambers and not in court. This case undoubtedly
stands alone, and has very much narrowed the power of the
court in issuing this great writ in favor of the liberty of the
citizen, from that repeatedly asserted in previous cases. But I
do nqt propose to disturb it. For the case before us is within
the doctrine of this case, and of every other that has heretofore
been passed upon by the court, as I shall proceed briefly to
show. The habeas corpus, which was issued in the case before
us, by the court below, to the marshal, brought up the body of
the prisoner, and also the warrant of commitment, into that
court, and the certiorari to the Commissioner brought up the
record, or tenor of the record of the proceedings before him,
upon w'hich the warrant had issued. The whole case, therefore,
was in that court. And pending the examination or hearing,
the prisoner, in all cases, on the return of the writ, is detained,
not on the original warrant, but under the authority of the writ
of habeas corpus. He may be bailed on the return de die in
diem, or be remanded to the same jail whence he came, or to
any other place of safe keeping under the control of the court,
or'officer issuing the writ, and by its order brought up from time
to time, till the court or officer determines whether it is proper
to discharge or remand him absolutely. The King's Bench may,
pending the hearing, remand to the same prison or to their own,

the Marshalsea. The efficacy of the original commitment is
superseded by this writ while the proceedings under it are pending, and the safe keeping of the prisoner is entirely under the
authority and direction of the court issuing it, or to which the
return is made. Bacon, title Habeas Corpus, B. 12; 5 Mod.

330, 346 ; 3 East, 156 ; 1 B. & Cr. 358 ; 4 B. & A. 295. Holt,
Chief Justice, observed, in the King v. Bethel, when a man
comes in by habeas corpus, by the power of the court, he may
be bailed to appear de die in diem, till the case is determined,
and then he may be remanded to the same prison. "By the
petition of right," he again remarks, "we are to bail or discharge
in three days, but when we bail (that is, de die in diem) and
afterwards remand him, it is no escape, for the entry is 'remittitur,' and that is a commitment grounded on the old one."
The Circuit Court, in the case before us, after reviewing the
proceedings on the return of the writ, and also to the certiorari,
arrived at the conclusion that they were regular and legal; and,
to use its own words, 1 Accordingly adjudges that the commitment and imprisonment of the prisoner, for the causes in the return to the habeas
corpu$, in the case set forth, are sufficient cause and warrant in
law for his detention by the marshal. Taerefore, it is ordered
by the court that, the writ, &c., be dismissed, and that the prisoner be remanded, and continued in the custody of the marshal,
under such his arrest and commitment by the aforesaid process,"
meaning the original warrant of the Commissioner.
The question here is, whether, upon the law governing, the
writ of habeas corpus, and to which I have referred, and upon
this judgment df the court, the prisoner is or is not held in confinement under the order of the Circuit Court. If he is, it is
admitted by all that this court has jurisdiction of the case, and
is bound to revise that decision. That court not only adjudges
the commitment and imprisonment lawful, but directs the
prisoner to be remanded, which, says Holt, Chief Justice, is a
commitment grounded on the old one; and, further, (which was
suterfluous,) the order directs that he shall be continued in the
custody, of the marshal, under the old commitment. How it
can be said, in view of the law governing this writ, and of the
form of the judgment of the court below, that the prisoner is
not in confinement under that judgmenzt, but simply, under the
process of the Commissioner, without dependence upon that
judgment, I admit I am incapable of comprehending. But if
any further authority is'wanting upon this question, I will refer
to an early case in this court,. Ex parte. B arford, 3 Cranch, 448.

case was reviewed on writ of habeas corpus by the- Circuit
Court, and the prisoner remanded; afterwards, a writ, issued
from this court, bringing up the prisoner, and also th proceedings which were before the court below. This court discharged
the prisoner, saying that the warrant of commitment by the
magistrates was illegal, for not stating the cause of commitment-that'the Circuit Court had revised the proceedings and
corrected two of the errors of the magistrates and left the rest.
The case, in principle, is not distinguishable from the one before
us. Here the Circuit Court has corrected none of the errors of
the Commissioner, if any, but confirmed all of them, and recommitted the prisoner to the custody of the marshal. It has
been argued that great inconvenience would arise, if the writ
of habeas corpus could issue from this court into any part of the
Union to bring up a prisoner on a petition that he was illegally
restrained of his liberty under the authority of the United
States, as the proceeding must be attended with delay and expense, by reason of the great extent of our territory. But, it
must be remembered that, in the case of a right of property
involved, dependent upon the laws of the Union, and a decision
against it, the party against whom a decision has been made
in a State court, however small the amount in controversy,
is entitled to a -writ of error t9 this court, to brinj up the
case for review, by tne 2-5th section of the same not in which
this 14th section is found. And I am yet to learn that the
right of the liberty of the citizen is not as dear to him, and
entitled to be guarded with equal care by the Constitution. and
laws, as the right of property, notwithstanding the supposed
inconvenience. Such has heretofore been, as we have seen, the
opinion in this court, when dealing with the writ in question;
and I will simply add, in the language of Chief Justice Denman,
in the case of the Canadian prisoners, "that it seems to me that
we would be tampering with this great remedy of the subject, the
writ of habeas corpus, if we did not say that we would abide
by the practice we find, and deal with this as it has been formerly dealt with." I am satisfied, therefore, that this court has
jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the
legality of the commitment below; and, as the whole ease is before us on this motion, by the stipulations of the parties, shall
proceed to an examination of the questions raised upon the merits.
It may, I think, be assumed, at this day, as an undoubted
principle of this government, that its judicial tribunals possess no power to arrest, and surrender to a foreign country,
fugitives from justice, except as authorized by treaty stipulations, and acts of Congress passed in pursuance thereof.
Whether Congress could cpnfer the power independently of a

SUPREME COURT
In re Kaine.

treaty, is a question not necessarily involved in this case, and
need not be examined. If it was, as.at present advised, I am
free to say that I have found no such power in any article or
clause of the Constitution, delegated to that body by the people
of the States. It belongs to the treaty-making power, and to
that alone, and its exercise is dependent upon the executive department, with the concurrence of two thirds of the Senators,
ano such I think has been the practical construction given to
the Constitution since the foundation of the government. We
must look, therefore, to the provisions of the treaty wit i Great
Britain, and the act of Congress passed in pursuance thereof,
for the authority to be exercised by the judiciary in the surrender
of the alleged fugitive in question, and by these provisions and
act, ascertain and determine whether or not the proceedings in
the tribunals below, who have ordered a surrender, are in conformity with them, and warranted by law. By the treaty,
"it is agreed, that the United States and Her Britannic Majesty, shall, upon mutual requisitions by them, or.their ministers,
officers, or. authorities, respectively made, deliver up to justice,
all persons who, being charged with the crime of murder," &c.;
"and the respective judges and other 'magistrates of the two
governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon
domplaint, made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehcnsion of the fugitive," &c.
In the case before us, Her Britannic Mfajesty's Consul at the
port of New York made a requisition and complaint, before one
of the United States Commissioners, against the fugitive in
question-upon which, a warrant was issued and the arrest
made, and, after an examination into the charge, committed,
for the purpose of being surrendered. No demand was made
upon this government, by the government of Great Britain,
claiming the surrender. This government was passed by, and
the requisition made by the Consul,.directly upon the magistrate,
on the ground, as contended for, namely, that the consent or authority of the Executive is unnecessary to warrant the institution of the proceedings ; and, in support of their propriety and
regularity, the position is broadly taken, and without which the
proceedings cannot be upheld, that, accorcing to the true interpretation of the treaty, any officer of Great Britain, however
inferior, properly represents the sovereign of that country, who
may choose to prosecute the alleged fugitive in making the
requisition, and is entitled. to the obedience of the judicial tribunals for that purpose, aiid if sufficient evidence is produced
lefore them,, to arrest. and commit, that a surrender may be
made; and, that in this respect, such officer is put on the footing
of any of the prosecuting officers of this government, who are

authorized to institute criminal proceedings for a violation of its
laws; that the country is open to him, throughout the limits of
the Union, and the judicial tribunals bound to obedience on
his requisition and proofs, to make the arrest and commitment.
Thik is the argument. Now, upon 3'ecurring to the terms of the
treaty it will be seen, I think, that no such stipulations were entered into, or intended to be entered into, by either government, or
any authority conferred to justify such a proceeding. The two
nations agree, that upon "mutual requisition by them, or their
officers or authorities respectively made - that is, on a requisition made by the one government, or by its ministers or officers
properly authorized, upon the other- the government, upbn
whom the demand is thus made, shall deliver up to justice all
persons charged with the crimes, as provided in the treaty. who
shall have sought an asylum within her territories. In otherwords,
on a demand, made by the authority of Great Britain upon this
government, it shall deliver up the fugitive; and so in respect
to a demand by the authority of this government upon her.
This is the exact stipulation entered into, when plainly interpre~ed. It is a compact between the two nations in respect to
a matter of national concern-the punishment of criminal
offenders against their laws -and
where the guilty party couild
be Lried and punished only within the jurisdiction whose laws
have been violated. The duty or obligation entered into, is the
duty or obligation of the respective ilations, and each is bound
to see that it is fulfilled, and each is responsible to the other in
case of a violation. 'When the casits fa'deris occurs, the requisition or demand must be made by the one nation upon the
other. And upon our system of government, a demand upon
the nation must be made upon the President, who has charge
of all its foreign relations, and with whom only foreign governments are authorized, or even permitted, to hold any colmfiunication of a national concern. He alone is authorized, by the
Constitution, to negotiate with foreign governments, and enter
into treaty obligations binding upon the nation ; and, in respect
to all questions arising out of these obligations, or relating to
our foreign relations, in which other governments are interested,
application must. be made to him. A requisition or demawd,
therefore, upon this government, must, under any treaty stipulation, be made upon the Executive, and cannot be made
through any other department, or in any other way. Judge
Marshall, in his celebrated argument in the case of Jonathan
Rol'bins, who was demanded by Great Britain, Linder the treaty
of 1796, and from which this part.of the treaty of 1842, was
taken almost verbatim, speaking of the reauisition in that case,
observes:

SUP-REME COURT.
In re Kaine.

"That the case was; in its nature, a national demand, made
upon the nation.' The parties were the two nations. They
cannot come into court to litigate their claims, nor can a court
decide on them. Of consequence, the demand is not a case of
judicial cognizance."
He further observes, that "the President is the sole organ of the nation, in i:s external relations,
and its sole representative with foreign nations. Of c6nsequence, the demand of a foreign nation can only be made on
him." Again, he says: "The department, which is intrusted
vth the whole foreign intercourse of the nation, with the negotiations of all treaties, with the power of demanding a reciprocal performance of the article, which is accountable to the
nation for the violation of its engagements with foreign nations,
and for the conseq-elnces resulting from such violation, seems
the proper department to be intrusted with the execution of a
national contract, like that under consideration."
The idea of a requisition of a foreign nation upon the judiciary of another, much more upon the humble magistrate of
another, demanding, as of right, the fulfilment of treaty obligations, is certainly novel, and one that I would not willingly
attribute to the distinguished men who negotiated this one, nor
to the governments that ratified it. So extraordinary ;ii interpretation ought not to be given to the instrument, unless upon
the plainest and most imperative terms. It does great injustice
to both nations. The prc ceedings, consequent upon it, compromit the character ahd dignity of the one making the demand,
and are disrespectful to the other, and may be dangerous to the
liberty of the citizen. The record before us shows, that a requisition, with due solemnity, was made upon the Commissioner,
in this case, by Her Britannic Majesty's government, through
her Consul, and seems 'to imply, that the magistrate is to act
under the power and authority of that government, rather than
in obedience to the laws of his own; and that a refusal to act
would be a ,ontempt of that authority, and of the casus farderis
of a treaty obligation. If any further argumcnt was wanting
for the interpretation of the treaty for which I am contending,
1 might refer to that given by the authority of Great Britain, in
providing by act of Parlkament for carrying it into execution
on her part.
By the 6th and 7th Victoria, chapter 76, it is enacted,
"That, in case a requisition shall at any time be made by
the authority of the United States, ia pursuance of, and accordin- to the said treaty, for the delivery of any person charged
with the crime of murder, &c., it shall be lawful for one of Her
Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, cr, in Ireland, for the
Chief Secretary of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in any

of Her Majesty's colonies or possessions abroad, for the officer
administering the government of any such colony or possession,
by warrant under his hand and seal, to signify that such requisition has been so made, and to require all justices of the peace,
and"magistrates and officers of justice, within the several jurisdictions, to govern themselves accordingly, &c.; and thereupon
it shall be lawful for any justice of the peace, &c.i to examine
upon oath any person or persons, touching the charge," &c.
Now, it will be seen that, according to the interpretation
given to the treaty by Great Britain, the requisition for the
delivery of the fugitive must be made by the President upon
that government, and its warrant obtained, before any magistrate within her dominion is authorized to' act in the matter.
The act of Parliament deals with the treaty as regulating a
matter of national concern, and in respect to which both nations
must act in carrying into execution its stipulations ; and it is
only after both have acted, and an authority obtained for the
surrender, that the power of the judiciary can be called into
requisition. I am satisfied this is a sound interpretation of its
provisions, and is one, while it secures the punishment of the
offender, guards the citizens and subjects of the respective
countries against any abuse of the power. While its exercise
is thus kept under the -supervision and control of the tw6
governments, there can be no danger of its being perverted, to
the purposes of private malice and revenge, which might justly
be apprehended, if left to the unrestrained discretion of the
subordinate officers of either. Tue construction, against which
I am contending, would refer the execution of the treaty to the
subordinate and inferior agents of both governments, so far as
the surrender of the fugitive, on our part, is concerned; for, as I
-understand that construction, any subordinate officer of Great
Britain may'make the requisition directly upon the magistrate,
for the apprehension and committal; and, upon such commitment being communicated to the government, the Secretary of
State issues his warrant that the prisoner be delivered to the
Britih authorities. And, as I am advised, that department
decided, in the case before us, that the government would not
go behind the decision of the Corhmissioner, adjudging the
prisoner guilty. Thus, the whole of the proceeding in the exercise of this high and delicate power, if the requisition of the
President, in the first place, is dispensed -with, would pass out
of the hands and beyond the control of the government. This
seems to" be the result of the American interpretatiou of the
treaty, sought to be established. It has been argued that, in
Metzger's case, in which demand was made by the French
government, under the treaty of November 9, 1843, the Execu-

140

tive declined to act until an application had been made to the
judiciary, and that this construction was sanctioned by the court
in that case. The treaty, in express terms, requires the requisition to be made through the diplomatic agents of the respective
governments; but that the surrender shall not be made until
the crime is established according to the laws of the country in
which the fugitive is found. In that case, the requisition was
made upon the Executive by the diplomatic agent of France,
who was referred to the judiciary. The application to the
judiciary, therefore, was with the approbation of this government. How formal it was given, does not appear in the case.
The same practice was adopted by the Executive, in the case of
Jonathan Robbins. There, on the requisition made by Great
Biitain upon the President, he referred the case to a Judge of
thc District Court of the United States, to inquire into the facts
and *determine whether or not he was guilty of the offence
charged against him. And it is upon this construction, given to
the treaty of 1795, upon-which all our subsequent treaties-of
extradition seem to have been drafted. The power to surrender is not confided exclusively to the Executive under the
treaty in question, nor was it under the treaty of 1795. On
the requisition being made, if the President is satisfied, upon
the evidence accompanying it, that a proper case is presented for a4 inquiry into the crime7 charged, the authorities claiming the fugitive are referred to the judiciary; and then, it is
the duty of the courts or judges to act and to take the proper
steps for' the arrest and inquiry. The Executive alone possesses no authority, under the Constitution and laws, to deliver up to a foreign power any person found within the States
of this Union, without the intervention of the judiciary. The
surrender is founded upon an alleged crime, and the judiciary
is the the appropriate tribunal to enquire into the charge. It
has also been urged that great inconvefience may exist in the
pursuit and apprehension of fugitives upon the construction
contended for, in consequence of the extended frontier line
between the two countries, as much time'will be consumed in
making the requisition upon the President. This may be so;
but I cannot agree that a sound construction of the treaty, and
one which affords nothing more than a just protection to the
,personal liberty of the citizen against the abuse of power, shall
be made to yield to the suggestions of convenience; for,
although the prisoner before us may be a foreigner, and even
may be a fit subject to be given up to the subordinate and irresponsible agents of the government claiming him, still, it is not
to be denied that the same power, thus attempted to be exercised
by them, in this instance, is equally applicable to any citizen of

the country, upon a like complaint; and besides, under our
system of laws and principles of government, so far as respects
personal security and personal freedom, I know of no distinc.
tion between the citizen and the alien who has sought an asylum
under them. I will simply add, that, according to the act of 6th
and 7th Victoria, already referred to, carrying into effect this
treaty, the indulgence o9f any such convenience in its execution,
is regarded as too dangerous to the subjects of that government
residing within its dominions, on the other side of this extended
boundary. The treaty, after providing'for the requisitibn of the
one government upon the other, for the surrender, then provides
that the respective judges and other magistrates of the two
governments shall have power, jurisdiction, and authority, upon
complaint made under oath, to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive. After the requisition has been made
upon the President, the organ of the government as regards our
foreign relations, and his authority obtained, The means are thus
provided for procuring the surrender. An application is then
made to the judiciary of the country, not upon the requisition
of the foreign government, but, as in all other cases, upon the
authority of its own -and the warrant issued in pursuance of
such application, runs in the name of the President of the
United States. The actof Congress, passed to carry our treaties
of extradition into effect, and of course this one among others,
*takes up the subject at this stage of the proceedings, and designates the judicial officers who are authorized to act, and prescribes, in general terms, the steps to be pursued in the arrest, the
examination of the criminal charge, and final commitment for
the surrender, if evidence of the criminality is found sufficient.
There is no necessary discrepancy between the provisions of
this act and the treaty, as the requisition of the one gqvernment upon the other is not attempted to be regulated or defined,
but is left as regoulated by the Terms of that instrument. The
provisions of the treaty must, therefore, be resorted to for the
purpose of ascertaining how that requisition shall be made. I
have already explained my interpretation of them, and need not
repeat it. The judiicial officers designated in the treaty, and
upon whom jurisdiction is conferred, are "the respective judges
and other magistrates of the two governments." The act of
Congress, in carrying out this provision, designates the Justices
of the Supreme Court, the Judges of the several District Courts
of the United States, the Judges of the several -State Courts,
and Commissioners specially'authorized so to do, by any of the
courts of the United States. The terms "other magistrates of
the" two governments," are quite indefinite and difficult in tlfeir
application by judicial construction. In ail enlarged sense,

they might embrace all the United States Commissioners
appointed by the Circuit Court, who, under the act of Congress
of the 23d of August, 1842, are authorized to arrest persons for
crimes against the United States, and imprison or bail the
same; and, also, all the justices of the peace of the several
States, upon whom like power is conferred by the 33d section
of the Judiciary Act of 1789. I can hardly suppose that the
distinguished citizen who represented this government in the
negotiation of the treaty, or the President, under whose supervision it was entered into, contemplated the exercise of so high
and delicate a power over the rights and liberty of the citizen,
by so numerous a body of the magistracy of the country. But,
be this as it may, Congress, in providing for the execution of
the treaty, has declared who shall const;itute those " other
magistrates," before whom the application may be made for the
arrest and examination, and have confined the jurisdiction, in
this respect to the Judge. of the several State courts, and Commissioners specially authorized by the courts of the United
States, for the performance of that duty. The provision necessarily excludes the great body of the State magistrates awl of
United States Commissioners, possessing general power to
arrest and commit for offences against the United States, and
is in no respect in conflict with any clause in the treaty, but in
harmony with it, and in furtherance of a proper and discreet
execution of its stipulations.
It has been argued that, adn.itting the State magistrates to
possess no power under the act of Congress passed to carry the
treaty into effect, yet that act confers the power upon the body
of United States Commissioners, authorized to arrest and commit for crimes against the United States, under the act of 1842.
A slight attention to the provisions of the act, I think, will
refute any such conclusion. The 1st section confers the exercise
of the power under the treaty, upon the Judges of the Federal
courts, and of the State courts, and upon " Commissioners authorized so to do by any of the courts of the United States ;"
and the 6th section provides-" That it shall be lawful for the
courts of the United States, or any of them, to authorize any
person or persons to act as a Commissioner or Commissioners
under the provisions of this act; and the doings of such person
or persons so authorized in pursuance of any of the provisions
aforesaid, shall be -good and available to all intents and purposes
whatever."
I Taking these two pzovisions together, and construing them
as part of a regulation prescribed by law for carrying the treaty
into effect, I think it plain that a Commissioner, competent to
act in the matter, must be specially appointed, or authorized by

DECEMNBER TERM, 1852.

143

the Federal courts for that purpose. The first section confines
the exercise of the power to Commissioners thus specially authorized to perform this duty; and the sixth provides for the
appointment of them, and declares that their doings in the
premises, in conformity with law, shall be good and valid. How
it can be said that the exercise of a power thus guarded and
restricted, both in the grant and in the appointment, is conferred,
also, upon a body of officers appointed under a different act,
and for other special and limited duties, I admit is beyond my
comprehension. But it is urged that if the act of Congress
cannot be construed as conferring the power, it may be derived
from the appointment of this Commissioner, under a rule of the
Circuit Court of the United States, adopted in January, 1851.
That rule provides that the clerk of the Circuit Court and of
the District Court, and their deputies, (the Commissioner in
question being a deputy of the Clerk of the District Court,)
shall be ex officio Commissioner of the Circuit Ccurt; and
shall be authorized to execute all the powers, and p6rform all
the duties conferred by several acts of Congress, enumerating
them, but of which the act of 1848, the one in question, is not
included, "or of any act of Congress having relation to such
Commissioners, and their duties or powers." These officers,
thus appointed by the Circuit Court, are authorized, by the several acts enumerated, to take affidavits and bail in civil cases;
and to arrest and commit for offences against the United States,
and the latter clause of the rule provides for the performance of
any other duties that may be conferred upon them by any other
acts of Congress. Now it is apparent, unless it can be shown
that the act of 1848 confers the power to act under the treaty
in the extradition of fugitives upon these officers, this clause in
the rule has no application to the case; and that no such power
has been conferred by that act, if I am not greatly mistaken,
has been already demonstrated. The rule of the court adds
nothing to the argument in favor of the power, as that depends
upon the act of Congress which provides for carrying the treaty
into effect, and which confers the power only upon Commis
sioners, specially appointed by the Federal courts for this purpose. The treaty provides that the arrest of the alleged fugitive, and commitrment for the purpose of a surrender, shall be
made, "upon such evidence of criminality as, according to
the laws of the place where the fugitive or person so charged
shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the crime or offence had there been
committed"
The act of Congress makes no provision on this subject, except as it respects the admissibility of a species of evidence

without the specific provision of the treaty, as the only mode of
proceeding, in summary criminal proceedirgs before the Federal
magistrates, is according to the practice before the State magisThe thirty-third section of the
trates in analogous cases.
Judiciary Act of 1789, expressly provides that summary proceedings against persons for crimes committed against the
United States, shall be agreeably to the usual mode of process
against offenders in the State in which he may be found. I am
not aware of any other act of Congress on the subject. 'This
accords with the construction given to the treaty in the act of
Parliament, 6th and 7th Victoria, which requires the production
of such evidence as, according to the lawk, of that part of her
Majesty's dominions where the prisoner is found, would justify
his apprehension and committal for trial, if The'crime had been
there committed. According to the laws of New York, regulating these summary proceedings, in criminal cases, evidence is

act of Congress, to carry into effect the treaty, provides that on
the hearing upon the return of the warrant of arrest, "copies
of the depositions upon which an original warrant in any
such foreign country may have been granted, under the hand
of the person or persons issuing such warrant, and attested
upon the oath of the party producing them, to be true copies of
the original depositions, may be receivec in evidence of the
criminality of the person so apprehended."
This species of evidence is exceedingly loose and unsatisfactory, in any aspect in which it can be viewed; but certainly it
cannot be characterized as evidence of any description, unless
it appears that the magistrate in the foreign count'y taking the
depositions and issuing the 'warrant, had jurisdiction of the
case, and was competent to perform these acts. Unless the
authority exists, the acts are coram non jtlaice, and void. And
the rule is universal, that in the case of magistrates, or other
persons of limited or special jurisdiction, any party setting up a
right or title under, and by virtue of, their acts or proceedings,
must first show affirmatively that they possessed jurisdictiof or
authority to act in the matter. The jurisdiction is never presumed. These arc principles too familiar to require a reference
to authorities. It was proved, in this case, that the person' taking the depositions in ireland, and issuing the warrant, acted as
a justice of the peace; and, it has been contended, that affords

DECEMBER

evidence not only of his appointment to that office, but also of
the competency of his jurisdiction. I cannot assent to this doctrine. I admit that evidence of a person exercising the duties
of a public officer, and even reputation of the fact, may dis-.
pense with the proof of a regular appointment, and if there is no
question as to the extent of his power or authority, the proof
will be sufficient. But if, in addition to the appointment, it becomes necessary to give evidence of his jurisdiction, neither his
acting in the office, or reputation, furnishes any evidence of the
fact. 1 Phillips, Ev. 432, 433, 450 ; C. & hill's Notes, 280, 281 ;
3 Wend. 267. If a contrary principle can be found in the law,
it is a little remarkable that the rule should ever have obtained
that, in an action founded upon the adjudication or decision-of
a magistrate, or any other officer of special and limited jurisdiction, the party claiming a right under it, must aver and prove
jurisdiction in the particular case, for the very adjudication, or
decision, would afford -all the necessary evidence of the officer
acting as such within the principle contended for. In other
words, the judgment would afford evidence per se of the jurisdiction, and in all cases dispense with further proof, and thus
every inferior magistrate would be placed upon the footing of
courts of general jurisdiction.. I do not think it necessary to
pursue this branch of 'the argument further; and am satisfied
that the Commissioner acted, in the arrest and commitment of
the prisoner, without any competent evidence of his guilt of
the crime alleged against him. To permit the copies as evidence, without proof of the jurisdiction of the magistrate, would
be against all principle, and might lead to the most scandalous
abuses in carrying into execution the stipulations of the treaty.
This species of evidence is very differently guarded, in the act
6th and 7th Victoria. There, copies of the depositions laid
before the government, and upon which the proper officer issued
his warrant to the magistrates, authorizing them to institute
proceedings to. arrest and commit the fugitive, are those only
permitted to be given in evidence. In other words, copies of
the depositions upon which the government acted in the matter,
are admissible as evidence of the criminality. The original of
these are those upon which our government make the requisi.
tion; and, of course, the good faith of the nation is pledged
that they were taken before competent officers, and that the'
facts stated in fi.m were true. But, in the case before us, the
copy was taken by a police officer of the foreion country, and
produced here before the Commissioners, without the sanction
of either government, and without any competent evidence of
the authority of the peson before whom it was taken. There
was no evidence of the authority of this magistrate, or of any

authority under the treaty, for the arrest of the accused, before
the Commissioner, but what depended upon the oral testimony
'of this officer, and the statement of the Consul, of what had
been represented to him in the matter. The Consul does not
aver that any of the facts stated by him, in what he calls his
requisition upon the Commissioner, were -within his own knowledge. Even the authority attempted to be derived from the
Under Secretary of State in Ireland, depends upon the oral
statement of this police witness; and I assert, and do so upon
the responsibility that I know belongs to my place and the occasion, that there is not one word or scintilla of evidence in the
record of the Commissioner, upon which the accused in this
case has been tried and adjudged guilty, but depends entirely
and exclusively upon the oral examination of this foreign police
officer, who does not pretend that he had any personal knowledge of the- commission of the crime. His knowledge only
extends to the verification of the copy of the deposition taken
before a person in Ireland, of whose authority to take it we
know nothing. To those familiar with the criminal laws of
this country, I need not say that such evidence, against any person charged with an offence against our laws, would be inadmissible and utterly worthless, and- especic.lly so, under the laws
of the State 6f New York, which must govern in this case, unless othierwise regulated by act of Congress; and equally so, in
my judgment, within a sound construction of the act providing
for the admissibility of these copies of a deposition, taken before
the foreign magistrate.
I have thus gone over the case mucti more at large than I should
have deemed it necessary, were it not for the very great diversity
of opinion in-respect to it among my brethren. I have regarded
it as a case of considerable importance, not only from the delicacy of the power involved in the treaty, the provisions of which
we are called upon to interpret, but also from the principles
lying at the foundation, which concern the rights and liberty
of every citizen of the United States. I cannot but think the
denial of the power to grant the writ of habeas corpus, in this
case, is calculated to shake the authority of a long line of deciions in this court, from Hamilton's case, decided in 1795, down
to the present one. That case, as understood aid expounded
in the case of Bollman and Swartwout, in 1807, which received
the most deliberate consideration of the court, and to which the
doctrine in Hamilton's case was applied, held that this great
writ was within the cognizance of the cDurt, under the 14th
section of the Judiciary Act, in all cases where the prisoner was
restrained of 'his liberty, "under, or by color of the authority of
the United States," and no case has held the c6ntrary since that

decision, with the exception of that of Metzger, decided in
1847, which, I have already stated, stands alone, but which distinctly admits the power and jurisdiction of the court in the
case before ug. This writ has always been justly regarded as
the stable bulwark of civil liberty; and undoubtedly, in the
hands of a firm and independent judiciary, no person, be he
citizen or alien, can be subjected to illegal restraint, or be deprived of his liberty, except according to the law of the land.
So essential to the security of the personal rights of the citizen was the uninterrupted operation and effect of this -writ,
regarded by the founders of the Republic, that even Congress
cannot suspend it, except when, in cases of rebellion or invasion,
the public safety may require it. I cannot, therefore, consent to
cripple or limit the authority conferred upon this court by the
Constitution and laws to issue it, by technical and narrow construction ; but, on the contrary, prefer to follow the free and
enlarged interpretation always given, when dealing with it by
the courts of England, from which country it has been derived.
They expound the exercise of the power benignly and liberally
in favor of the deliverance of the subject from all unlawful imprisonment; and, when restrained of his liberty, he may appeal
to the highest common-law court in the kingdom, to inquire into
the. cause of it. So liberally do the courts of England deal
with this writ, and so unrestricted is its operation in favor of
the security of the personal rights of the subject, that the decision of one court or magistrate upon the return to it, refusing
to discharge the prisoner, is no bar to the issuing of a second,
or third, or more, by any other court or magistrate having jurisdiction of the case, and it may remand or discharge, according to
its judgment, upon the same matters. 13 ZL & Welsby, 679; 9

is in confinement under the treaty and act of Congress, without
any lawful authority. I am of opinion, therefore, that the writ
of habeas corpus should issue in the case, to bring up the prisoner.

to entertain the proceedings under the treaty for the apprehension and committal of the alleged fugitive, without a previous
requisition, made under the authority of Great Britain, upon
the President of the United States, and his authority obtained
for the purpose.

an officer within the treaty or act of Congress, upon whom the
power is conferred, to hear and determine the question of criminality, upon which the surrender is to be made.

I concur in opinion with my brother Nelson. The questions
involved in this application are very grave ones; and I should
have felt it to be my duty to state the grounds on which my
opinion has been formed, had not the whole subjebt been so
fully and, to my mind, satisfactorily discussed by him. But,
concurring, as I do, in all that he has said, I shall forbear anydiscussion on my part, and content myself with expressing my
entire assent to the opinion he has just delivered.
Mr. Justice DANIEL.
The question just disposed of by the court, involving the
lives and liberties, not only of those who from abroad may seek
protection under our laws, but the lives and liberties of our own
citizens, is undoubtedly one of the most important which can
claim the vigilance of our government in every department.
Having deliberately compared my own views of this vital question with what has been so well expressed by my brother Nelson, and 6oncurring, as I do, in all that lie has said upon it, I
deem it unnecessary to do more than thus solemnly to attest
my adherence to the great principles of lav, justice, and liberty
vindicated by him.
