ANb HENRY B. TATHAM.

JUNIOR,

GEORGE

N.

TATHAM,

In a patent for improvements upon the machinery used for making pipes and tubes
from lead, or tin, when in a set, or- solid. state, by forcing it under great pressure,
from out of a receiver, through apertures, dies, and cores, the claim of the patentees
was thus stated : "What we claim as otr invention, and desire to secure by letterspatent, is the combination of the following parts, above described, to wit, the core
andbridge, or 'uide-piece, the chamber, and the dip, when used to form pipes of
metal, under heat and pressure, in the manner set forth, or in any other manner
substantially the same."
The Circuit Court charged the jury, "that the originality did not consist in the
novelty of the machinery, but in bringing a newly discovered principle into practical application, by which an useful article of manufacture is produced, and wrought
pipe made as distinguished from cast pipe:'
This instruction was erroneous.
Under the claim of the patent, the combination of the machinery must be novel.
The newly discovered principle, to wit, that lead could be forced, by extreme
pressure, when in a set or solid state, to cohere and -orm a pipe, was not in the
patent, and -the question whether it was or was not the subject of a patent, was not
in the case.

Mr. Justice Curtis, having been of counsel for the defendants
in error, upon the letters-patent drawn in question in this case,
did not sit at the hearing.
This case was brought up, by writ -of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York.
The declaration was filed by the defendants in error, on the
8th of May, 1817, to recover darpages in a plea of trespass
upon the ca'e, from the plaintiffs in erfor, and Robert W. Lowber, for the alleged infringement of their patent, for new and
useful improvements in machinery, or apparatus for making
pipes and tubes from metallic substances.
The declaration alleged, that John and Charles Hanson, of
Huddersfield, England, were the in-jentors of the alleged improvements, on or betrT the 31st of August, 1837.
-That on the 10th of January, 1840, the Hansons, assigned. in
writing, to H. B. and B. Tatham, (two of the defendants in error,) the full and exclusive right to the said improvements.
That on the 29th of March, 1841, letters-patent of the United
States were granted to H. B. & B. Tatham, as assignees of the
Hansons, for the said improvements.
.That .on the 12th of October, 1841t H. B. & B. Tatham,
assigned to G. N. Tatham, (the remaining defendant in error,)
one undivided third part of the said letters-patent.
That on the 14th of March, 1846,-the said letters-patent havin&,been surrendered bn account of the defective specifications

157

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

of the said improvements, new letters-patent were issued therefor, on an amended specification, whereby there was granted to
the plaintiffs below, their heirs, &c., for the term of fourteen
years from the 31st of August, 1837, the full and exclusive right
of making, vending, &c., the said improvements; a description
whereof was annexed to and n.de a part of such patent.
That the letters-patent were of the value of $50,000; and that
the defendants below had wrongfully and unlawfully made, used,
.and vended the said improvements, and made lead pipe to the
amount of 2,000 tons, thereby to the injury of the plaintiffs;
$20,000.
To this declaration, the defendants, Le Roy and Smith, pleaded not guilty; the defendant, Lowber, making no defence, and
permitting a default to be taken against him.
The cause was tried at the April Term, 1849, and a.verdict
rendered by the jury in favor of the plaintiffs, for $11,394, and
costs, and a bill of exceptions was tendered" by the defendants
below.
On the trial of the cause below, the plaintiffs produced, 1. Their patent of 1846, and the specification referred to
therein, and making a part of the same.
2. They read in evidence certain agreements between the defendant, Lowber, and the defendants, Le Roy and Smith.
3. They gave evidence, tending to prove that J. & C. Hanson were the original and first inventors of the improvement;
that the invention was a valuable one, &c.
4. That lead, recently become set, under heat and pressure,
in a close vessel, would reunite perfectly after a separation of
its parts; that, in the process described .in the said patent, pipe
was so made; that the Hansons were the first and original discoverers thereof; and that such discovery, and its reduction to
a prdctical result, in the mode described in the patent, was useful and important.
5. That the defendants, Smith and LeIfoy, had been jointly
engaged with Lowber in making lead pipe upon the plan described in the letters-patent, and selling the same, and had thus
made dnd sold large quantities of pipe; that the agreement between them, relative to the manufacture of pipe, was colorable
only, and was made as a cover to protect Le Roy'and Smith,
and throw the responsibility on the defendant, Lowber, who
was insolvent.
6. That the improvement described in the said letters-patent
was the same invention for which letters-patent had been granted
to the Hansons,' in England, and to 11. B. & B. Tatham, here,
as their assignees.
7. That the plaintiffs had been ready, and had offered to sell

the said invention, and had sold the same for a large portion of
the United States, within the last eighteen months.
The defendants below then read in evidence, 1. The description of the English patent to the Hansons.
2. The patent to H. B. & B. Tatham, of 1841, and the specification thereof.
3. The specification of an English patent, granted to Thomas
Burr,
of 11th
April,
4. The

specification of Burroughs Titus, granted
in 1831.
5. The patent granted to George W. Potter, in 1833.
6. The evidence of George Fox, tending to show the invention and use by him of a similar machine, in 1830.
7. The specification of a patent to John Hague, in 1822.
8. The specification of a patent granted to Busk & Harvey,
in 1817.
9. The specification of a patent granted to Ellis & Burr,in 1836.
10. The specification of a patent granted to Joseph Bramah,
in 1797.
11. The defendants then gave evidence tending to prove that
J.,& C. Hanson were not the original, and first inventors of the
combination of machinery described in the letters-patent.
12. That the invention was not useful, nor the lead pipe,
made upon the plan described, good.
13. That the combination of machinery described in public
works, as having been invented by Titus, Potter, Fox, Hague,
Bramah, and Busk & Harvey, were substantially the same as
that described in the plaintiffs' patent.
14. That lead, when recently become set,, under, heat and extreme pressure, in a close vessel, would not reunite perfectly
after a separation'of its parts; and that, in the process as described in the plaintiffs' patent, it was not in a set, but in a
fluid state when it passed the bridge.
15. That the defendants, Le Roy & Smith were not concerned in the manufacture of the pipe, or in making or using
the machinery; that it was made for them by the defendant,
Lowber, at a certain price per hundred pounds; and thai they
had not infringed upon the patent of the plaintiffs;
16. That the improvement described in the plaintiff's patent,
of o1846, was not the same invention as that for which letterspatent had previously been granted to the Hansons, and to H.
B. & B. Tatham.
17. That, for the space of eighteen months, from the date of
the patent of 1841, the plaintiffs .had neglected to put and continue on sale to the public, on reasonable trust, the invention
or'discovery for which the said patent issued.

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

159

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

The evidence being closed, the case was argued before the
jury, after the court had given the charge, which will be presently stated. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, which,
when increased by the court, amounted to $11,748.60. The
following bill of exceptions brought up the rulings of the court
upon the several points made:
The evidence being.closed, the Judge charged the jury
That the first question which it was material to determine
was, what was the invention or discovery of John and Charles
Hanson, for which their patent had issued, as the precise character .of that invention had been the subject of controversy on
the trial.
The patentees state in their specification, that the invention
consists in certain improvements upon, and additions to, machinery for making pipes of metal, capable of being pressed,
as described in Burr's patent, dated April 11, 1820. They then
describe Burr's apparatus, and the process by which the pipe
was made by it, and state the defects of that plan, in consequence of which, they say, it failed to go into general use.
These defects they claim to have overcome and remedied;
and staie that they had found that lead, and some of its alloys,
when just set, or short of fluidity, and under heat and great
pressure, in a close vessel, would reunite, after a separation of
its parts, as completely as if it had not been separated, or,
in other words, that, under these circumstances, it could be
welded.
That, on this discovery, and in reference to and in connection
with it, they made a change in the machinery of Burr, by
which they succeeded in making perfect pipes, and were enabled
to use a bridge at the end of the cylinder and short core, and
thus surmount the difficulty of the Burr machine.
They also state, that they do not claim any of the parts the cylinder, core, die, or bridge; but that they claim the
combination when used to form pipes of metal, unde- heat and
pressure, in the way they have described.
There can be no doubt that, if this combination is new, and
produces a new and useful result, it is the proper subject of a
patent. The result is a new manufacture.
And even if the mere combination of machinery in the abstract is not new, still, if used and applied in connection with
the practical development of a principle, newly discovered; producing a new and useful result, the subject is patentable. To
which last opinion and decision, the counsel for the defendants
did then and there except.
In this view, the improvement of the plaintiffs is the application of a combination of machinery to a new end,- to the

160

COURT.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

development and application of a new principle, resulting in a
new and useful manufacture.
That the discovery of a new principle is not patentable; but
it must be embodied and brought into operation by machinery,
so as to produce a new and useful result.
Upon this view of the patent, it is an important question, for
the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether the fact is
established on which the alleged improvement is founded, that
lead, in a set or semi-solid state, can thus be reunited or welded
after separation.
The Judge here commented briefly upon the testimony, referring to the experiments which were testified to, and the results
of which were exhibited to the jury, on the part of the plaintiffs and defendants, and, in continuation, stated:
That there was one experiment which was testified to by Mr.
Keller, and the result of which was shown to the jury, which
was made under circumstances that seem not to be subject to
any misapprehension, and which, if he is not mistaken, and his
testimony is correct, would seem to settle the question. But
this was a question of fact, to be decided by the jury on the
evidence. Hereupon, the counsel for the defendants excepted to
this part of the charge of the Judges.-- That it had been objected, that the improvement described in the patent of March
14, 1846, was different from that of Marca 29, 1841. The act
only authorized a reissue for the same invention, the first specification being defective. - That he had compared the descriptions contained in the two patents, and, -though the language
was in some parts different, it would be found that the improvement was substantially the same, and thal; he therefore apprehended they would have no great difficulty in this branch of,
the case; to which the defendants' counsel excepted. -That it
was also objected, that the plaintifls' patent was invalid, for
want of originality; that the invention had been before described in public works, and Bramah, Hague, TitLs, Fox, and
Potter, were relied on by the defendants. - That, in the view
taken by the court, in the construction of the patent, it was
not material whether the mere combinations of machinery re'ferred to were similar to the combination used by the Hansons;
because the originality did not consist in the novelty of the
machinery, but in bringing a newly-discovered principle into
practical application, by which a useful article of manufactttre
is produced, and wrought pipe made, as distinguished from
cast pipe. Hereupon the defendants' coursel excepted.
That in the patents referred to, from the year 1797 to 1832,
the combination which was claimed to be identical, was confessedly used for making pipe, by casting with fluid lead in a

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

mould, and after it was set by the application of water, forcing
it out.
And the question is, whether any of these inventions are substantially the same as the plaintiffs'; whether, even if by these
modes pipe had been successfully made for common use, it
Would have been made in the same manner as the Hansons'; to
which opinion the counsel for the'defendants excepted.
That it was further objected that the patentees have forfeited
their rights, on account of having omitted to put and continue
the invention on sale within eighteen months after the patent
was granted, upon reasonable terms. The Judge here commented upon the testimony on this part of the case, and in continuation said:
That it was not essential, under the section of the statue
referred to, that the patentees should take active means for the
purpose of putting their invention in market, and for6ing a sale,
but that they should at all time's be ready to sell at a fair price,
when a reasonable offer was made.
That it was for the jury to say whether it was put and continued on sale, under this view of the law; to which opinion
the counsel for the defendants excepted.
That the defendants, LeRoy and Smith, contend that they
have not infringed the plaintiffs' patent; that they were but the
purchasers of the pipe, and that Lowber wvas the manufacturer,
under the agreement which has been read.
The Judge here referre4 to the evidence on this branch of the
case, and said:
That if the contract made by the defendants with Lowber,
was bond fide, and they had no connection with the manufacture
of the articles, except to furnish lead and pay him a given price,
deductingthe expenses; and if the contract was in fact carried
out and acted upon in that manner, then the defendants would
not be liable. But if the agreement was only colorable, and
was entered into for the purpose of deriving the benefit and
profits of the business, without assuming the responsibility for
the use of the invention, and for the purpose of throwing the
responsibility on Lowber, who was insolvent, then they were
as responsible as he was.
That aiding and assisting a person in carrying on the business and in operating the machinery, would implicate the,
parties so engaged. If, therefore, these defendants participated
actively in condi.-ting the machine, directing and supervising
its operations; if the evidence establishes that position, then,
as aiding and assisting, they are as responsible as Lowber, (to
-which last opinion and decision the defendants' counsel
excepted.)

162

SUPREME COURT.
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

Prior to the giving of the preceding harge to the jury, the
defendants' counsel requested the court to instruct them according to the following written proposition submitted; and his
honor, after he deli vered the said charge, took up the said propositions in their order, and gave the instructions to the jury,
which are respectively subjoined thereto.
Proposition I. If the jury believe that t;he agreements exe.
cuted on the 13th of April and 13th of Alay, 1846, by which
Lowber, as manufacturer, was to make the pipe for LeRoy &
Co., on his machine, at 55 cents the 100 pounds, was real and
bond fide, on an actual dissolution of the partnership of Lowber & LeRoy, and not colorable to throw the respoxisibility of
working the machine on Lowber alone, then the plaintiffs cannot
recover.
Upon which, his honor said that he had already given all the
instructions he deemed necessary on that point; the proposition
was correct, and it was for the jury to decid: that fact.
Proposition II. That even if the Tathams first introducea
the pipe in question in this country, as an article of commerce,
that does not give them any right to recover, unless the patents
under which they claim were good and valid, for an invention
not before known, used, or described in a public work.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury, as requested by
the defendants' counsel.
Proposition III. That if the jury believe that the combination patented by the plaintiffs was before patented by Burroughs Titus, or any one else in this country, or patented and
described in a well known public work abroad, the plainttffs
cannot recover, althorgh such machines thus patented were not
actually put in operation, so as to make pipe for the public.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury that he had already
stated to.them that the plaintiffs' invention did not consist in
the mere combination of machinery, and, therefore, if those
patents were for casting lead pipe, the point was not material;
that it was not necessary that they would have made pipe for
public use to defeat a subsequent patent. To which instruction, and refusal to instruct the'jury as requested, the defendants'
counsel excepted.
Proposition IV. That the Tatham patent is void on its face,
the Burr machine having the entire combination, including heat
and pressure, and the lead in a set state. _The patent is void
for claiming too much; should only have been for the improvement, viz. substituting the bridge and short'core for the long
core, and not for the whole combination.
His honor declined to give this instruction, to which the,
defendants' counsel excepted.

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.
Le Roy at al. v. Tathdm et al.

Proposition V. That the bridge and short core having been
before patented in this country by Burroughs Titus, and also
before used in other machines, no claim could be made for introducing into Burr's combination such bridge.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury as follows: Undoubtedly that is so, but that is not the plaintiffs' claim.
Proposition'VI That the state of the lead, when used as
described in the plaintiffs' specification, being a principle of
nature, is not the subject of a patent, either alone or in combination with the machine mentioned in that specification.
To which his honor stated, the first part of the proposition
was correct, and the latter part not; and the defendantV' counsel excepted.
Proposition VII. That the using of a metal in a certain
state, or dt a certain temperature, alone, or in combination with
a machine, was not the subject of a patent.
To which his honor stated, I have already instructed the jury
that the invention, as described by the Hansons, is a patentable
subject; to which the defendants' counsel excepted.
Proposition VIII. That if the jury believe that the combination of cylinder, piston, bridge, short core, die, and chamber,
under heat and pressure, was before patented in this country, by
Burroughs Titus, then the plaintiffs cannot recover.
Whereupon, his honor instructed the jury, that novelty in the
mnere combination of the machinery was not essential to the
plaintiffs' right to recover, except as connected with the develop.
ment and application of the principle before mentioned; to
which the defendants' counsel excepted.
Proposition IX. That if the jury believe that the same com-.
bination of cylinder, piston, bridge, short core, die, and chamber, under heat and pressure, had before -been patented in
England, by Bramah, and published in a well known work, then
the plaintiffs cannot recover.
His honor instructed the jury, that Bramah's patent" and the
Tathams' were not identical, and declined to instruct them as
requested; to all which the defendants' counsel excepted.
Proposition X. That if the jury believed that the Burr,
Bramah, Titus, and Hague machines, or either of them, were
published to the world in well known public works, and had the
same combination, in whole or in part, as the Hanson machine,'
up to a certain point, the Tathams' patent is void, for claiming
too much, viz. the whole combination.
His honor instructed the jury, that he had explained to them
his views on that part of the case, and declined to instruct them
as requested, in the form of which the proposition was stated;
and to which the defendants' counsel excepted.

164

SUPREME COURT
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al

Proposition XI. That the reissue of the patent of 1846, on
which alone the plaintiffs can claim, was not warranted by the
patent of 1841, it being for a different, and not the same invention, misdescribed by inadvertence, accident, or mistake; and,
in fact, was a new patent, under color of a reissue.
That if the jury believe that the reissue of 1846 was for a
different invention from the. patent of 1841, and not for the
same invention, misdescribed by inadvertence, accident, or
mistake, then the plaintiffs cannot recover.
His honor declined to instruct the jury according to the first
branch of this proposition, to which the defendants' counsel
excepted; but did instruct them in the affirmative, upon the last
branch thexeof
Proposition XII. That if the jury believe that the combination patented, was before dbscribed in some well known public '
work, either in this country or in England, the plaintiffs cannot
recover, although such machine, or the pipe made by it, was
never introduced in this country.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury in the affirmative.
Proposition XIII. If the jury believe that the combination
claimed was before known or used, to make lead pipe, by others
than the Hansons or the Tathams, "theplaintiff are not entitled
to recover, no matter how limited such knowledge or use was, if
the invention was not kept secret.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury in the affirmative.
Proposition XIV. That if the Maccaroni machine, or the
Busk and Harvey clay-pipe machine, contained the same combination as the plaintiffs' machine, that the plaintiffs cannot
recover, by reason of applying the same combination to a new
use.

Which instructions his honor declined to give, and stated
that he had explained to them his views on that subject; and
the defendants' counsel excepted.
Proposition XV. That if the jury believe that Mr. Lowbcr's
machine was used by his men when the lead was in a fluid, and
not in a set, or solid state, then there was no infringement, and
the plaintiffs cannot recover, if the plaintiffs' patent were valid.
Upon which his honor instructed the jury in the affirmative.
Proposition XVI. That the jury are the sole and exclusive
judges, as questions of fact, whether the combination and pro.
cess were the same in plaintiffs' machine as was in Bramah's,
or in any other of the machines proved on the trial.
Upon which his honor charged the jury that this was so undoubtedly, subject, however, to the princiFles of law, as laid
down in his preceding charge and instructions; to which the
defendants' counsel excepted.

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

165

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

Proposition XVIL That if the jury believe that the lead,
when it may be successfully used to make pipe with plaintiffs?
machine, must not be in a set or solid state, as described in their
specification, and that it can only be thus used in a fluid or
pasty state, then that the patent is void, and the jury should
lind for the defendants, on the ground that the specification does
not fairly and fully describe the nature of the invention claimed,
nor the condition in which the. lead should be used, so as 'to
enable the public to ascertain the true nature of the invention,
the manner of using the machine, and the condition in which
the lead ought to be used.
W hich instruction his honor answered in the affirmative.
The jury then retired to consider their verdict, under the said
charge. and instructions; and subsequently on the 25th day of
May, 1849, returned into court with a verdih for the said plaintiffs for $11,:394 damages, and six cents costs.
And, inasmuch as the said several matters aforesaid, do not
appear by the record of the said verdict, the said defendants'
counsel did then and there request his honor, the said Judge, to"
put his seal to this bill of exceptions, containing the said several matters aforesaid; and his honor, the said Judge, did, in
pursuance of the said request, and of the statute in such case
made and provided, put his seal to this bill of exceptions, containing the said several matters aforesaid, at the city of New York,
aforesaid, the same 25th day of .May, 1849.
S. NELSON.
The case was argued by AIr. Gillett and Mr. Noyes, with
whom was 1M1r. Barbour, for the plaintiffs in error, and by lr.
Cutting-and .lr. Staples, for the defendants in error.
The points made by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error,
were the following.
1. In construing a patent, and deciding what are the inventions patented thereby, the summing up is conclusive. Nothing
is patented but wvhat is expressly claimed. Moody v. Fiske, 2
Mason, 112, 118; Rex v. Cutler, 1 Starkie, R. 354; Davies on
Patents, 398, 404; Bovil v. Mo6re, 2 Marsh. R. 211; Wyeth v.
Stone, 1 Story, R. 285; Hovey v. Stevens, 3 W. & M. 17.
2. What is described in a patent, and not claimed, whether
invented by the patentee or not, is dedicated to the public, and
cannot be afterwards claimed, as a part of his patent, in a reis-,
sue, or otherwise. Battin v. Taggart, Judges Kane and Grier,
September 10, 1851; 6th section of act of 1836; Mellus v.
Silsbee, 4 Mason, 111; Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218; Shaw
v. Cooper, 7 Pet. 292, 322, 323; Pennock v. Dialogue,-2 Pet. 1,

3. A patent -void in part, is void in whole, except when othe-

wise provided by statute. Wyeth v. Stone, 1 Story, R. 285,
273-293-4 ; Moody v. Fiske, 2 Mason, 118, 119; Woodcock

Gr. 178; M Farlane v. Price, 1 Starkie, 199; Minton v. Moore,
1 Nev. & P. 595 ; Rex v. Cutler, 1 Starkie, R. 359.
4. The Judge was bound to present to the consideration of
the jury, as a question of fact, in the words of the statute,
whether the patentee, being an alien, "had failed and neglected,
for the space of eighteen months from the date of the patent,
to put and continue on sale to the public, on reasonable terms,
the invention for which the patent issued." Tatham and others
v. Loring, decision by Judge Story on this patent, cited on brief.
5. It was error in the Judge to instruct the jury that he had
examined the surrendered and reissued patent, and found the
improvement the same. He should have submitted the question, as one of fact, to the jury, for them to determine, upon the
evidence, of the weight of which they were the exclusive judges.
It was also error to instruct them that Bramah's and Tatham's
patent were not identical. That was a question for the jury.
Curtis, see. 381 ; Carver v. Braintree, 2 Story, R. 432 ; Stimpson
v. West Chester Railroad Co. 4 Howard, 381.
6. The question, whether-the combination had been previously
patented, or described in a printed publication, was one of fact,
which should have been submitted to the jary.
7. Applying an old machine to a new use, or to produce a
new result, is not the subject of a lawful patent. Boulton v.
Bull, 2 H. Bl. 487; Lash v. Hague, Web. Pat. 207; Crane v.
Price, 4 Mann. & Grang. 580; Huddart v. Grainshaw, Web.

179, (43 Com. Law, 100, 110); Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11
Howard, 248, 266 ; Curtis,§ 26, 27.
8. Making an addition to arn old combination does not authorize a patent for the whole combination. Stich a patent
would be broader than the invention, and -void.

The counsel for the defendants in error made the following
points:
No exception was taken to the admission or exclusion of testimony; but solely to the Judge's charge.
The invention for which the patent was granted consisted in
the discovery, that, under certain conditions, and by the use and
applic.tion of certain methods, lead, and some of its alloys,
while in a set state, could, after being separated into parts, be
re-united and welded, and thus formed into pipe; and also of
the mode of doing this; producing thereby a new article of
manufactuie, wrought lead pipe -avoiding the objections which
had always prevented success in casting pipe; and by this discovery overcoming the defects of Bur's method, on which this
was an improvement.,
The patentees, in describing the invention, say that they
"have found from experience that lead and some of its alloys,
when recently become set, or in a condition just short of
fluidity, being still under heat and extreme pressure, in a close
vessel, will reunite perfectly after a separation of its parts," and
that, therefore, they construct their machinery as follows - arid

then proceed to describe the machinery or apparatus, as adapted
by them to this discovery, and by whiph they produce the practical result-aboye stated.
After describing the apparatus afid the modes of using it, the
patentees repeat, "that the remarkable feature of their invention is, that soft metals, when in a set state, being yet under
beat can be made, by extreme pressure., to reunite perfectly,
around a core after a separation, and thus be formed into strong
pipes or tubes."
And "that the essential difference in the. character of this
pipe, distinguishing it from all others before made, was, that it
was wrought under heat by pressure and constriction from set
metal; and that it is not a casting formed in a mould."
And they close by claiming, as their invention, "the combination described by them, when used to form pipes of metal
under heat and pressure in the manner set forth."
The Judge, in his charge, in commenting on the patent, states
the invention to be substantially as above stated; and to this
construdtion and view of the patent, no exception was taken by
the defehdants.
The court then proceed further to instruct the jury, and in
answer to certain propositions submitted by the plaintiffs in error
for the consideration of the court.
I. The first proposition laid down by the court, is, that the
mere combination of machinery, not new, iri theabstract, when
combined with and applied to the practical development of a
new principle, to produce a new and useful result, may be the
subjectof a valid patent. This priciple is repeated seveial times,
in different connections, in the course of the charge to the jury;
nd as often excepted to by the counsel for the defendants.
The counsel for the defendants in error, insist that the above
position is correct, and supported by principle, by precedent, and
by practice.
1. The position is supported by principle, founded on the
statutes giving patents to inveuitors. He who discovers a new
principle, and points out the means of applying it, to produce a
new and useful result, comes -within the settled construction of
the English act, giving a patent for the sole working of any
manner of new manufactures. See 6th section of the act 21
James 1, (1623.) By our patent law, any person, having invented or discovered any new manufacture, &c., is entitled to a
patent. See 6th section of the act 4th July, 1836. The term
new manufacture includes not only the thing produced, but the
means of producing it.
2. This principle is supported by authority. Curtis, Pat. § 9

II. The second exception by the defendants' counsel is to the
charge of the court, in relation to Mr. Keller's evidence.
It is difficult to see upon what ground this exception of the
defendants to the charge of the court is founded. After remarking upon the character and weight of the fact testified to,
the whole is submitted to the jury for their de~ision.
III. The third exception taken to the charge of the court is
found in the next two paragraphs on the same page, and rclates"
to the reissued patent. The same is repeated in the call of the
defendants, in their eleventh proposition, upon which they ask
the court to instruct the jury.
The substance of the charge, as given in both instances, is,
that, the language in one patent was in some parts different from
that in the other, but the meaning was substantially the same
in both. That the reissued patent must be for the same invention as the first; and the matter of fact was left to the jury.
IV. The next exception is to the charge o f the court, as found
at the top of the 42d page of the case, and is as follows:
"That in the patents referred to, from the year 1797 to 1832,
the combination which was claimed to be identical, was confessedly used for making pipe, by casting with fluid lead in a
mould, and after it was set, by the application of water, forcing
it out.
" And the question is, whether any of these inventions are
substantially the same as the plaintiffs'; whether, even, if by
these miodes, pipe had been successfully made for common use,
it would have been made in the same manner as the Hans6ns';
to A\hich opinion, the counsel for the defendants excepted."
Whether the modes referred to by the court, of manufacturing
pipe, were the same or different, was a question of fact left to

the jury; and the court did not, by the raanner of stating the
point, withdraw it from the consideration of the jury.
V. The fifth exception relates to the charge of the court, as
to the duty of the plaintiffs to put and keep the invention on
sale on reasonable terms, and they say that it was not essential
that the patentees should take active mea.as for the purpose of
putting their invention in market, and forcing a sale; but that
they should at all times be ready to sell a; a fair price, when a
reasonable offer was made.
That it was for the jury to say whether it was put and continued on sale, under this view of the law - to which the counsel
for the defendants excepted.
We insist that the court took a correct view of the statute,
and prpperly submitted the question of fact to the jury; and
that the exception is not well taken.
VI. The next exception in the order in which the defendar ts
in error have noticed them, relates to the instructions of tMe
court, in rehition to the liability of Le Roy and Smith jointly,
with the other defendant, Lowber.
It seems, to the counsel for the defendants in error, that the
question was properly submitted to the jury, as a question of
fact, how far Le Roy and Smith had made themselves liable
with Lowber. The defendants in error insist that the exception
to this part of the charge is not well taken.
VII. In answer to the fourth proposition, on which the court
was requested to instruct the jury that Tatham's patent was
void on its face, &c. We say that the charge of the court was
correct. The patentees in Tatham's patent have pointed out
clearly what they claim, and what' they do not claim.
VIII. In their ninth proposition, the defendants requested the
court to instruct the jury"That if they believed the same combination of cylinder,
piston, bridge, short core, die, and chamber, under heat and
pressure, had before been patented in England by Bramah, and
published in a well known work, then the plaintiffs cannot
recover."
Upon this. proposition the court instructed the jury, mat
Bramah's patent and the Tathams'- were not identical; and declined to instruct the jury as requested. To which the counsel
for the defendants excepted. This request by the defendants
for the above instruction was based on the assumption of a fact
not proved and not true, and was correctly refused.
IX. The defendants requested the court to instruct the jury
according to.their ±enth proposition, which is as follows -" That
if the jury believe that the Burr, Bramah, Titus, and Hague
machines, or either of them, were published to the world in well

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

known public works, and had the same combination, in whole
or in part, as the Hanson machine, up to a certain point, the
Tathams' patent is void for claiming too much, viz., the wbole"
combination; and the court thereupon instructed the jury, 'iat
they had explained their views on that part of the ease, and
declined to instruct them as requested in the form in which the
proposition was stated." To which the counsel for the defendants excepted, and the defendants in error insist that this
exception is not well taken.
X. The sixteenth proposition, on which the court was requested to instruct the jury, is in the following words, namely, " That the jury are the sole and exclusive judges as to the
questions of fact, whether the combination and process were the
same in the plaintiffs' machine as was Bramah's, or in any
other of the machines proved on the trial. And thereupon the
court instructed the jury, that this was so undoubtedly; subject,
however, to the principles of law as laid down in the preceding
charge and instructions." To which the counsel for the defendants excepted.
The defendants in error insist that none of the exceptions
aforesaid are well taken; and that said judgment should be
affirmed, with costs and damages.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a ease on error, from the Circuit Court of the Southern
District of New York.
The action was brought in the Circuit, Court, to recover damages for an alleged infringement of a patent for new and
useful improvements in machinery for making pipes and tubes
from metallic substances.
The declaration alleged that John and Charles Hanson, of
England, were the inventors of the improvements specified, on
or prior to the 31st of August, 1837 ; that on the 10th of January,
1840, the Ilansons assigned to H. B. and B. Tatham, two of
the defendants in error, the full and exclusive right to said
improvements; that, on the 29th of March, 1841, letters-patent
were granted for the improvements to the Tathams, as thie
assignees of the Ilansons; that, afterwards, H. B. and B.

On the 14th of Mareh, 1846, the said letters-patent were surrendered, on the ground that the specifications of the improvements elained were defective, and a new patent was 'issued,
which granted to the patentees, their heirs, &c., for the term of
fourteen years, from the 31st of August, 1837, the exclusive
right to make and vend the improvements secured. The

172

COURT.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham ot al.

declaration states, the patent was of the value of fifty thousand
dollars; and that the defendants below had made and vended
lead pipe to the amount of two thousand tcns, in violation of the
patent, and to the injury of the plaintiffs twenty thousand dollars.
The defendants pleaded not guilty; the defendant Lowber
did not join in the plea, but permitted judgment to be entered
against him by default. 'On the trial, certain bills of exceptions
were taken to the instructions of the court to the jury, on which
errors are assigned.
The schedule, which is annexed to the patent. and forms a part
of it, states that the invention consists "in certain improvements
upon, and additions to, the machinery used for manufacturing
pipes and tubes from lead or tin, or an alloy 'of soft metals
capable of being forced, by great pressure, from out of a
receiver, through or between apertures, dies, and cores, when in
a set or s6lid state, set forth in the specification of a patent
granted to Thomas Burr, of Shrewsbury, in Shropshire, England, dated the 11th of April, 1820." After describing Burr'A
machine, its defects, and the improvements made on it as
claimed, the patentees say, "Pipes thus made are found to
possess great solidity and unusual strength, and a fine uniformity of thickness and accuracy of bore is arrived at, such as,
it is believed, has never before been attained by any other
machinery."
"The essential difference in the character of this pipe, %vhich
distinguishes it, as well as that contemplated by Thomas Burr,
from all other heretofore known or attempted, is that it is
wrought under heat, by -pressure and constriction, from set
metal; and that it is not a casting formed in a mould."
And they declare, " We do not claim as our invention and
improvement, any, of the parts of the above-described machinery, independently of its arrangement and combination
above set forth.. What we do claim as our invention, and desire
to secure, is, the combination of the fo1oing parts above
described, to wit: the core and bridge, or guide-piece, with the
cylinder, the piston, the chamber and the di, when used to
form pipes of metal, under heat and pressure, in the manner set
forth, or in any other manner substantially the same."
The plaintiffs gave in evidence certain agreements between
the defendants, showing the manufacture of lead pipe by the
defendant Lowber, for the defendants Le Roy and Smith. And
also evidence tending to prove that the said John Hanson and
Charles Hanson were the original and first inventors of the
improvement described in the said letters-patent; that the
invention and discovery therein described was new and useful;
that the lead pipe manufactured thereby, was superior in quality

173

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

and strength, capable of resisting much greater pressure, and
more free from defects, than any pipe before made; that in all
the modes of making lead pipe, previously known and in use,
it could be made only in short pieces, but that by this improved
mode it could be made of any required length, and also of any
required size; and that the introduction of lead pipe, made in
the mode described, had superseded the use of that made by
any of the modes before in use, and that it was also furnished
at a less price."
"And the.plaintiffs also gave evidence tending to prove that
lead, when recently become set, and while under heat and
extreme pressure in a close vessel, would reunite Aerfectly,
after a separation of its parts; and that in the process described
in the said patent', lead pipe was manufactured by being thus
separated and reunited; and that the said John and Charles
Hanson were the first and original discoverers thereof; and that
such discovery, and its reduction to a practical result in the
mQde described in said letters-patent, was useful and important."
"And the plaintiffs also gave evidence, conducing to prove
that the improvement, described in the letters-patent, was the
same invention and discovery which had been made by the said
John and Charles Hanson, and for which letters-patent had
been granted to them in England, and subsequently in this
country, to the Tathams, as recited in the letters-patent."
"And the plaintiffs also gave evidence conducing to prove
that they had been ready and willing, and had offered to sell
the said invention, within eighteen months succeeding the
issuing of said letters-patent totthem, and also since; and had,
within the said eighteen months, sold the same for a large portion of the United States."
The defendants' counsel then read in evidence from the
"Repertory of Arts," vol. 16, page 3414, the description of the
patent to the Hansons, dated August 31, 1837. They also
read in evidence the patent issued upon the application of the
plaintiffs to the Patent Office, containing another specification,
which was annexed to the patent surrendered. And also they
read the specification of Thomas Burr's patent, of April 11,
1820. Also a patent granted to George W. Potter, described
in the 12th "Franklin Journal of Arts," pubhshed in 1833;
they also read the specification of a patent granted in England,
to Bush and Harvey, on December 5th, 1817; and also the
specification of a patent granted in England to Joseph Bramah,
October 31st, 1797.
Evidence wa also given, to show that the combination of
machinery for making lead pipe, described in public works as
150

SUPREI1E

COU]T.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

having been invented by Burroughs Titus, by George W. Potter,
by Jesse Fox, by John Hague, and by Joseph Bramah, were
substantially the same as that used by the plaintiffs; that the
combination of machinery, patented as herein before stated, by
Bush and Harvey, for making pipes of ck.y, and that used for
making macearoni, were substantially the same as that described
in the plaintiffs' patent.
In their charge to the jury, the court said, " They, the plaintiffs,
also state, that they do not claim any of the parts of the machinery, the cylinder, core, die, or bridge, but that they claimed the
combination when used to form pipes of metal, under heat and
pressure, in the way they have describec. There can be no
doubt that if this combination is new, and produces a new and
useful result, it is the proper subject of a patent." " The result
is a new manufacture. And even if the mere combination of
machinery in the abstract is not new, still, if used and applied
in connection with the practical development of a principle,
newly discovered, producing - new and useful result, the subject
is patentable. In this view, the improvement of the plaintiffs is
the application of a combination of machinery to a new end;
to the development and application of a new principle, re,.ulting
in a new and useful manufacture. That the discovery of a
new principle is not patentable, but it must be embodied and
brought into operation by machinery, so as to produce a new
and an useful result. Upon this view of the patent, it is an
important question for the jury to determine, from the evidence,
whether the fact is established, oil which the alleged improvement is founded, that lead in a. set, or semi-solid state, can thus
be reunited or welded, after separation." To this instruction
the defendants excepted.
It was also objected, that the plaintiffs' patent was invalid for
want of originality; that the invention had been before described in public works, and Bramah, Hague, Titus, Fox, and
Potter, were relied on by the defendants.
To this it was replied, by the court, " That in the view taken
by the court in the construction of the patent, it was not merial whether the more combinations of machinery referred to
were similar to the combination used by te Hansons, because
the originality did not consist in the novelty of the machinery,
but in bringing a newly discovered principle into practical application, by which a useful article of manufacture is produced,
and wrought pipe made as distinguished from cast pipe." To
this charge there was also an exception.
The word principle is used by elementary writers on patent
subjects, and sometirnes in adjudications of courts, with such a
want of precision in its application, as to mislead. It is ad-

DECEMBE1

i:ERM, 1852.

175

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

mitted, that a principle is not patentable. A principle, in the
abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive;
these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them
an exclusive right. Nor can an exclusive right exist to a new
power, should one be discovered in addition to those already
known. Through the agency of machinery a new steam power
may be said to have been generated. But no one can apprbpriate this power exclusively to himself, under the patent laws.
The same may be said of electricity, and of any other power in,
nature, which is alike open to all, and may be applied to useful

purpose' by the use of machinery.
In all such cases, the processes used to extract, modify, and
concentrate natural agencies, constitute the invention. The
elments of the power exist; the invention is not in discovering
them, but in applying them to useful- objects. Whether the
machinery used be novel, or consist of a new combination of
parts known, the right of the inventor is secured against all who
use the same mechanical power, or one that shall be substantially the same.
A patent is not good* for an effect, or the result of a certain
process, as that would prohibit all other persons from making
the same thing by any means -whatsoever. This, by creating
monopolies, would discourage arts and manufactures, against
the avowed policy of the patent laws.
A new property discovered in matter, when practically applied, in the construction of a u~eful article of comraierce oF
manufacture, is patentable; but the process through -%,hich the
new propcrty is developed and applied, must be stated, with
such precision as to enable an ordinary mechanic to construct
and apply the necessary process. This is required by the patent
laws of England and ofrthe United States, in order that When
the patent shall run out, the public may know how to profit by
the invention. It is said, in the case of the Househill Company
v. Neilson, NVebster's Patent Cases,-6S3, "A patent will be good,
though the :ubject of the patent consists in the discovery of a
great, general, and most comprehensive principle in science or
hiw of nature, if that principle is by the specification applied to
Mly special purpose, so as thereby to efictuate a practical
re,,lilt andl benelit not previously attained." In tlhat ease, AMr.
Justice Clerk, in his charge to the jury, said, " the specification
do,: not claim any thing as to the forrm, nature, shape, materials,
numibefs, or matliecntical character of the vessel or vessels in
vhich the air is- to be hea'ed, or as to the mode of heating such
vessels," &c. The patent was for "the improved applicatiQn
of air to produce heat in fires, forgcs and furnaces, where bellows or other blowing apparatus are required."

176

SUPREME COURT.
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham ot al.

In that case, although the machinery was not claimed as a
part of the invention, the jury were instructed to inquire,
"whether the specification was not such as to enable workmen
of ordinary skill to make machinery or apparatus capable of
producing the effect set forth in said letters-patent and specification." And, that in order to ascertain whether the defendants
had infringdd the patent, the jury should inquire whether they,
" did by themselves or others, and in contravention of the privileges conferred by the said letters-patent, use machinery or apparatus substantially the same with the machinery or apparatus
described in the plaintiffs' specification, and to the effect set
So it would
forth in said letters-patent and specification."
seem that where a patent is obtained, without a claim to the
invention of the machinery, through which a valuable result is
produced, a precise specification is required; and the test of
infringement is, whether the defendants have used substantially
the same process to produce the same result.
In the case before us, the court instructed the jury that the
invention did not consist "in the novelty cf the machinery, but
in bringing a newly discovered principle into practical application, by which a useful article of manufacture is produced, and
wrought pipe made as distinguished from cast pipe."
A patent for leaden pipes would not be good, as it would be
for an effect, and would, consequently, prohibit all other persons
from using the same article, however manufactured. Leaden
pipes are the same, the metal being in no respect different. Any
difference in form and strength must arise fron the mode of
manufacturing the pipes. The new property in the metal
claimed to have been discovered by the patentees, belongs to
the process of manufacture, and not to the thing made.
But we must look to the claim of the invention stated in
their application by the patentees. They say, "WWe do not claim
as our invention and improvement any of the parts of the above
described machinery, independently of their arrangement and
combina ' va above set forth." " What wc claim as our invention, anc desire to secure by letters-patent, is, the combination
of the following parts above described, to wit, the core and
bridge or guide-piece, the chamber, and the die, when used to
form pipes of metal, under heat and pressure, in the i anner set
forth, or in any other manner substantially the same."
The patentees have founded their claimn on this specification,
and they can neither modify nor abandon it in whole cr in part.
The combination of the machinery is claimed, through which
the new property of lead was developed, as a part of the process in the structure of the pipes. But the jury were instructed,
"that the originality of the invention did not consist in the

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

177

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

novelty of the machinery, but in bringing a newly discovered
principle into practical application." The patentees claimed
the combination of the machinery as their invention in part,
and no such claim can be sustained without establishing its
novelty - not as to the parts of which it is composed, but as to
the combination. The question -whether the newly developed
property of lead, used in the formation of pipes, might have
been patented, if claimed as developed, without the invention
of machinery, was not in the case.
In the case of Bean v. Smallwood, 2 Story, R. 408, Mr. Justice Story said, "He (the patentee) says that the same apparatus, stated in this last claim, has been long in use, and applied,
if not to chairs, at least hi other machines, to purposes of a
similar nature. If this be so, then the invention is not new, but
at most is an old invention, or apparatus, or machinery applied to
a new lurpose. Now I take it to be clear, that a machine, or
apparatus, or other mechanical contrivance, in order to give the
party a claim to a patent therefor, must in itself be substantially new. If it is old and well known, and applied only to a
new purpose, that does not make it patentable."
We think there was error in the above instruction, that the
novelty of the combination of the machinery, specifically claimed
by the patentees as their invention, was not a material fact for
the jury, and that on that ground, the judgment must be reversed. The other rulings of the court excepted to, we shAl not
examine, as they are substantially correct.
.Mr. Justice Nelson, Mr. Justice Wayne, and Mr. Justice Grier
dissented.
Mr. Justice NELSON-dissenting.
The patent in this case, according to the general description
given by the patentees, is, forimprovements upon, and additions
to, the machinery or apparatus of Thomas Burr, for manufacturing pipes and tubes from metallic substances. They declare,
that the nature of their invention, and the manner in which the
same is to operate, are particularly described and set forth in
their specification. In that, they refer to the patent of Burr of
the 11th April, 1820, for making lead pipe out of set or solid
lead by means of great pressure, the product being -wroughtpipe,
as contradistinguished from, cast, or pipe made according to the
drawbench system. The apparatus, as described by Burr, consisted of a strong !-on cylitder, bored sufficiently true for a piston to traverse easily within it. This cylinder was closed, at
one end by the piston, and also closed at the other, except a
small apertur for the die which formed the external diameter
of the pipe. The core or mandril, which determined the inner

SUPREME

COURT.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham e3t al.

diameter, was a long cylindrical rod of steel, one end of which
was attached to the face of the piston, extending through the
centre of the cylinder, and passing also through the centre of the
die at the opposite end, leaving a space around the core and
between it and the die for the formation of the pipe. The metal
to form the pipe was admitted into the cydnder in a fluid state,
and when it become set or solid, the power of a hydraulic press
was applied to the head of the piston, which, moving against the
body of solid lead in the cylinder, drove it through the die, the
long core advancing with the piston and 'with the body of lead
through the die, and thus forming the pipe. The cylinder
usually holds from three to four hundred pounds of lead, and
continuous pipe is made till the whole charge is driven out.
This plan, though one of deserved merit, and of great originality, failed, when reduced to practice, except for the purpose of
making very large pipe, larger than that usually in demand, and
consequently passed out of general use. The long core attached
to the face of the piston, advancing with it in the solid lead under the great pressure required, was liable to warp and twist
out of a straight line, and out of centre ia the die, which had
the effect to destroy the unifor mity of the thickness and centrality
of the bore of the pipe.
The old mode, therefore, of making pipe by the draw-bench
system, continued down to 1837, when the patentees in this case
Aiscovered, by experiment, that lead, when recently set and solid,
but still under heat and extreme pressure, in a close vessel,
would reunite after a separation of its parts, and "heal" (in the
language of the patentees) "as it were by the first intention," as
completely as though it had not been divided.
Upon the discovery of this property of lead, which had never
before been known, but, on the contrary, had been supposed
and believed, by all men of science skilled in metals, to be impossible, the patentees made an alteration in the apparatus of
Burr, founded upon this new property discovered in the metal,
and succeeded completely in making wrought pipe out of solid
lead by means of the hydraulic pressure. The product was so
much superior in quality to that made according to the old
mode, that it immediately wholly superseded it in the market.
The pipe was also made much cheaper.
The patentees, by their discovery, were enabled to dispense
with the long core of Burr, and to fix firmly a bridge or cross
bars at the end of the cylinder near the die, to which bridge
they fastened a short core extending into and through the die.
By this arrangement they obtained a firm, immovable core,
that always preserved its centrality with the die, and secured
the manufacture of pipe of uniformity of thickness of wall and

accuracy of bore, of any dimension. The lead after being admitted into the cylinder in a fluid state, was allowed to remain
till it became solid, and was then driven by the piston through
the apertures in the bridge into the chamber between it and the
die, where the parts reunited, after the separation, as completely
as before, and, passing out at the die around the fixed short core,
formed perfect pipe.
The patentees state, that they do not intend to confine themselves to the arrangement of the apparatus thus particularly
specified, and point out several other modes by which the same
result may be produced, all of which variations would readily
suggest themselves, as they observe, to any practical engineer,
without departing from the substantial originality of the invention, the remarkable feature of which, they say, is, that lead,
when in a set state, being yet under heat, can be made, by extreme pressure, to*reunite perfectly around a core after separation, and thus be formed into strong pipes or tubes. Pipes thus
made are found to possess great solidity and unusual strength,
and a fine uniformity, such as had never before been attained
by any other mode. The essential difference in its character,
and which distinguishes it from all other theretofore known,
they add, is, that it is wrought under heat, by pressure and constriction, from set or solid metal.
They do not claim, as their invention or improvement, any
of the parts of the machinery, independently of the arrangement
and combination set forth.
" What we claim as our invention, they say, is, the combination of the following parts above described, to wit: the core and
bridge or guide-piece, with the cylinder, the piston, the chamber,
and die, when used to form pipes of metal under heat and pressure, in the manner set forth, or in any other manner substantially the same."
It is supposed that the patentees claim, as the novelty of their
invention, the arrangement and combination of the machinery
which they have described, disconnected from the employment
of the new property of lead, which they have discovered, and
by the practical application and use of which they have succeeded in producing the new manufacture. And the general
title or description of their invention, given in the body of their
letters-patent, is referred to as evidence of such claim. But
every patent, whatever may be the general heading or title by
which the invention is designated, refers to the specification
annexed for a more particular description; and hence this court
has heretofore determined, that the specification constitutes a
part of the patent, and that they must be construed together
when seeking to ascertain the discovery claimed. Hogg et al.
v. Emerson, 6 How. 437.

180

SUPREIE

COURT.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

The same rule of construction was applied by the Court of
Exchequer, in England, in the case. of Neilson's patent for the
hot air blast. Webster's Cases, 37.
Now, on looking into the specification, we see, that the leading feature of the invention consists in the discovery of a new
property in the article of lead, and in the employment and adaptation of it, by means of the machinery described, to the production of a new article, wrought pipe, never before successfully
made. Without the discovery of this new property inithe metal,
the machinery or apparatu*s would be useless, and not the subject of a patent. It is in connection with this property, and the
embodiment and adaptation of it to practical use, that the machinery is described, and the arrangement claimed. The discovery of this new element or property led naturally to the apparatus, by which a new and most useful result is produced. The
apparatus was but incidental, and subsidiary to the new and
leading idea of the invention. And hence, the patentees set
forth, as the leading feature of it, the discovery, that lead, in a
solid state, but under heat and extreme pressure in a close vessel, will reunite, after separation of its parts, as completely as
though it had never been separated. It required very little ingenuity, after'the experiments in -a close vessel, by which this
new property of the metal was first developed, to construct the
necessary machinery for the formation of the pipe. The apparatus, essential to develop this property, would at once suggest
the material parts, especially in the state of the art at the time.
Any skilful mechanic, with Burr's machine before him, would
readily construct the requisite machinery.
The patentees, therefore, after describing their discovery of
this property of lead, and the apparatus by means of which
they apply the metal to the manufacture of pipe, claim the
combination of the machinery, only when used to form pipes
under heat and pressure, in the manner set forth, or in any other
manner substantially the same. They do not claim it as new
separately, or when used for any other purpose, or in any other
way; but claim it, only, when applied for the purpose and in
the way pointed out in the specification. The combination, as
machinery, may be old; may have been long used; of itself,
what no one could claim as his invention, and may not be the
subject of a patent. What is claimed is, that it never had been
before applied or used, in the way and for the purpose they have
used and applied it, namely, in the embodiment and adaptation of
a newly-discovered property in lead, by means of which they are
enabled to produce a new manufacture-wrought pipe-out of
a mass of solid lead. Burr had attempted it, but failed. These
patentees, after the lapse of'seventeen yecrs, having discovered

DECEMBER TER,

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

this new property in the metal, succeeded, by the use and exployment of it, and since then, none other than wrought lead
pipe, made out of solid lead, has been found in the market, having superseded, on account of its superior quality and cheapness,
all other modes of manufacture.
Now the construction, which I understand a majority of my
brethren are inclined to give to this patent, namely, that the patentees claim, as the originality of their invention, simply, the
combination of the machinery employed, with great deference,
seems to me contrary to the fair and reasonable import of the
language of the specification, and also of the summary of the
claim. The tendency of modern decisions is to construe specifications benignly, and to look through mere forms of expression,
often inartificially used, to the substance, and to maintain the
right of the patentee to the thing really invented, if ascertainable upon a liberal consideration of the language of the specification, when taken together. For this purpose, phrases standing
alone are not to be singled out, but the whole are to be taken ii
connection. 1 Sumn. 482-485.
Baron Parke observed, in delivering the opinion of the court
in Neilson's patent," That, half a century ago, or even less, within fifteen or twenty years, there seems to have been very much a
practice with both judges and juries to destroy the patent-right
even of beneficial patents, by exercising great astuteness in
taking objections, either as to the title of the patent, but more
particularly as to the specifications, and many valuable patent
rights have been destroyed in consequence of the objections so
taken. Within the last ten years or more, the courts have riot
been so strict in taking objection to the specifications, and
they have endeavored to hold a fair hand between the patentee
and the public, willing to give the patentee the reward of his
patent."
Construing the patent before us in this spirit, I cannot but
think, that the thing really discovered, and intended to be described, and claimed by these patentees, cannot well be mistaken.
That they did not suppose the novelty of their invention consisted, simply, in the arrangement of the machinery described,
is manifest. They state, distinctly, that the leading feature of
their discovery consisted of this new property of lead, and some
of its alloys, -this, they say, is the remarkable feature of their
invention, -and
the apparatus described is regarded by them
as subordinate, and as important only as enabling them to
give practical effect to this newly-discovered property, by means
of which they produce the new manufacture. If they have
failed to describe and claim this, as belonging to their invention,
it is manifest, Upon the face of their specification, that they have
VOL. XIV.

16

SUPREME

COURT.

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

failed to employ the proper words to describe and claim what
they intended; and that the very case is presented, in which, if
the court, in the language of Baron Parke, will endeavor to hold
a fair hand between the patentee and the public, it will look
through the forms of expression used, and discover, if it can, the
thing really invented. Apply to the specification this rule of
construction, and all difficulty at once disappears. The thing
invented, and intended to be claimed, is too apparent to be mistaken.
The patentees have certainly been unfortunate in the language
of the specification, if, upon a fair and liberal interpretation,
they have claimed .only the simple apparatus employed; when
they have not only set forth the discovery of this property in
the metal, as the great feature in their invention, but, as is manifest, without it the apparatus would have been useless. Strike
out this new property from their descripion and from their
clair, and nothing valuable is left. All the rest would be
worthless. This lies at the foundatiofi upon which the great
merit of the invention rests, and without a knowledge of which
the new manufacture could not have been produced; and, for
aught we know, the world would have beer, deprived of it down
to this day.
If the patentees had claimed the combination of the core and
bridge or guide-piece, with the cylinder, tha chambers, and the
die, and stopped there, I admit the construction, now adopted
by a majority of my brethren, could not be denied; although,
even then, it would be obvious, from an examination of the
specification as a whole, that the draughtsman had mistaken the
thing really invented, and substituted in its place matters simply
incidental, and of comparative insignificance. Bat the language
of the claim does 'not stop here. The combination of these
parts is claimed only when used to form pipes of lead, under
heat and pressure, in the manner set forth, - that is, when used
for the embodiment and adaptation of this new properr in the
metal for making wrought pipe out of a solid mass of lead.
This guarded limitation of the use excludes the idea of a claim
to the combination for any other, and ties it down to the instance, when the use incorporates within it the new idea or element which gives to it its value, and by means of which the
new manufacture is produced. How, then, can it be consistently
held, that here is a simple claim to the machinery, and nothing
more, when a reasonable interpretation of the words not only
necessarily excludes any sixch claim, but in express .terms sets
forth a different one, - one not only different in the conceptiol
of the invention, but different in the practical working of the
appar-us, to accomplish the purpose intended?

DECEMBER

183

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

I conclude, therefore, that the claim, in this case, is not simply
for the apparatus employed by the patentees, but for the embodiment or employment of the newly-discovered property in
the metal, and the practical adaption of it, by these means, to
the production of a new result, namely, the manufacture of
wrought pipe out of solid lead.
Then, is this the proper subject-matter of a patent ?
m
This question was first largely discussed by counsel and court
in the celebrated case of Boulton v. Bull, (2 Hen. 31, 463,) involving the validity of Watts's patent, which was for "a new
invented method for lessening the consumptionl of fuel and
steam in fire-engines.'
This was effected- by inclosing the
steam vessel or cylinder with wood, or other material, which
preserved the heat in the steam vessel; and by condensing the
steam in separate vessels. It was admitted, on the argument,
that there was no new mechanical construction invented by
Watt, and the validity of the patent was placed on the ground
that it was for well-known principles, practically applied, producing a new and useful result. On the other hand, it was
conceded, tfiat, the application of the principles in the manner
described was new, and produced the result claimed; but -it was
denied, that this constituted the subject-matter of a patent.
Heath and Buller, Justices, agreed with the counsel for the defendant. But Lord Chief Justice Eyre laid down the true doctrine,
and which, I think, will be seen to be the admitted doctrine of
the courts of England at this day. " Undoubtedly," he observed,
"there can be no patent for a mere principle; but for a principle, so far embodied and connected with corporeal substances as
to be in a- conditio. to act, and to produce effects in any art,
trade, mystery, or inatiual occupation, I think there may be a
patent. Now, this," he continues, "is, in my judgmefit, the
thing for which the patent stated in the case was granted; and
this is what the specification describes, though it miscalls it a
principle. It is not that the patentee conceived an abstract
notion, that the consumption of 5team in fire-engines may be
lessened; but he has discovered a practical manner of doing it;
and for that practical manner of doing it he has taken this patent. Surely," he observes, i' this is a very different thing from
taking a patent for a principle. The apparatus, as we have
said, was not new. There is no new mechanical construction,
said the counsel for the patentee, invented by Watt, capable of
being the subject of a distinct specification; but his discovery
was of a principle, the method of applying which is clearly set
forth." Chief Justice Eyre admitted that the means used were
iiot new, and that if the patent had been taken out for the mechanism used, it must fail.

184

SUPREME COURT.
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

He observed, "When the effect produced is some new substance or composition of things, it should seem that the privilege of the sole working or making ought to be for such new
substances or composition, without regard to the mechanism or
process by which it has been produced, which, though perhaps
also new, will be. only useful as producing the new substance."
Again, " When the effect produced is no new substance, or composition of things, the patent can only be for the mechanism,
if new mechanism is used; or for the process, if it be a new
method of operating, with or without old mechanism, by which
the effect is produced." And again, he observes, "If we wanted
an illustration of the possible merit of a new method of operating with old machinery, we might look to the identical case
before the court." p. 496, 493, 495.
This doctrine, in expounding the law of patents, was announced in 1795, and the subsequent adoption of it by the
English courts, shows, that Chief Justice Eyre was considerably
in advance of his associates upon this branich of the law. He
had got rid, at an early day, of the prejudice against patents so
feelingly referred to by Baron Parke in Neilson v. Harford, and
'comprehended the great advantages to his country if properly
encouraged. He observed, in another part of his opinion, that
"The advantages to the public from improvements of this kind
are beyond all calculatiort important to a commercial country;
and the, ingenuity of artists, who turn their thoughts towards
such improvements, is, in itself, deserving of encouragement."
This doctrine was recognized by the Court
340, 350. of King's Bench
in the King v. Wheeler, 2 B. & Ald.
It is there observed, that the word "manufactures," in the
patent act, may be extended to a mere process .to be carried on
by known implements or elements, acting upon known substances, and ultimately producing some other known substance)
but producing it in a cheaper or more expeditious manner, or
of a better or more useful kind.
Now, if thi process to be carried on by known implements
acting upon known substances, and ultimaely producing some
other Known substance of a better kind, is patentable, afortiorl
will it be patentable, if it ultimately prodr.ces not some other
known substance, but an efttirely new and useful substance.
In Forsyth's patent, which consists of the application and
use of detonating powder as primingfIor 1-he discharge of firearms,it was held that whatever might be the ,construction of
-the lock, or contrivance by which the powder was to be discharged, the usd of the detonating mixture as' priming, which
article of itself was not new,.was an infringement. Webster's

Le Roy 'bt al. v. Tatham et al.

This case is founded upon d doctrine which has been recognized in several subsequent cases in England, namely, that
where a person discovers a principle or property of nature, or
where he conceives of a new application of a well-known principli- or property of nature, and also, of some mode of carrying
it out into practice, so as to produce or attain a new and useful
effect or result, he is entitled to protection against all other
modes of carrying the same. principle or property into practice
for obtaining the same effect or result.
The novelty of the conception consists in the discovery and
application in the one case, and of the application in the other,
by which a new product in the arts or manufactures is the
effect; and the question, in ease of an infringement, is, as to the
substantial identity of the principle or property, and f the application of the same, and consequently.the means or machinery
made use of, material only so far as they affect the identity of
the application.
In the case of Jupe's patent for "an improved expanding
table," Baron Alderson observed, speaking of this doctrine, "You
cannot take out a patent for a principle; you may take out a
patent for a principle coupled with the mode of carrying the
principle into effect. But then, you must start with having invented some mode of carrying the principle into effect; if you
have done that, then you are entitled to protect yourself from
all other modes of carrying the same principle into effect, that
being treated by the jury as piracy of your original invention."
Webster's Pat. Cases, 147. The same doctrine was maintained
also in.the case of Neilson's patent for the hot air blast, in the
K. B. and Exchequer in England. Webster's Pat. Cases, 342,
371 ; Curtis, § 74, 14S, 232; Webster's Pat. Cases, 310.
This patent came also before the Court of Sessions in Scotland; and in submitting the case to the jury, the Lord Justice
remarked, " That the main merit, the most important part of the
invention, may consist in the conception of the original ideain the discovery of the principle in science, or of the law of nature, stated in the patent; and little or-no pains may have been
taken in workii3g out the best mode of the application of the
principle to the purpose set forth in the patent. But still, if the
principle is stated to be applicable to any special purpose, so as
to produce any result previously unknown, in the way and for
the objects described, the patent is good. It is no longer an
abstract principle. It becomes to be a principle turned to
account, to a practical object, and applied to a special.resfilt.
It becomes, then, not an abstract principle, which means a
principle considered apart from any special purpose or practical
operation, but the discovery and statement of a principle for a

SIYPREME COURT.
Lo Roy et al. v. TVtham et al.

special purpose, that is, a practical invention, a mode of carrying
a principle into effect. That such is the law," he observes, "if a
well-known principle is applied for the fist time to produce a
practical result for a special purpose, has never been disputed,
and it -would be very strange and unjusi; to refuse the same
legal effect, when thi inventor has the additional merit of
discovering the principle, as well as its application to a practical
object."
Then he observes, again, "Is it an objection to the patent that
in its application of a new principle to -a: certain specified result,
it includes .every variety of mode of applying the principle
according to the general. statement of the object and benefit to
be attained? This," he observes, "is a question of law, and I
must tell you distinctly, that this generality of claim, that is, for
all modes of applying the principle to the .purpose specified,
according to, or within a general statemnent of the object to be
attained, and of the use to be made of the agerit, to be so
applied, is no objection to the patent. Tie application or us-,
of the agent for the purpose specified, may be carried out in t
great variety of ways, and only shows ihe beauty -and simplicity, and comprehensiveness of the inventioj."
This case was carried up to the Htouse of Lords on exceptions to the charge, and among othcrs, to -his part of it, which
was the ,sbxth excep: ion, and is as follows: "In so far as lie
(the Judg) did not direct the jury, that on the construction of
the patent and specification, the patentee cinnot claim or mainfain that his patent is one which applies to all the varictics in
the apparatus which may be employed in heating air while
under blast; but was limited to the particalar described in the
specification." And although the judgment of the court was
reversed in the House of Lords on the eleventh exception, it
was expressly affirmed as respects this one. Lord Campbell at
first doubted, but after the decisibn of the courts, in England on
this patent, he admitted the instruction was right. Webster,
Pat. Cases, 683, 684, 698, 717.
I shall not pursue a reference to Tne authorities on this subjict any further. The settled doctrine to be deduced from them,
I think, is, that a person having discovered the application for'
the first time of a well-known law of nature, or well-known
property of matter, by means of vhich a new result in the arts
or in manufactures is produced, and has pointed out a mode by
which it is produced, is entitled-to a patent; and, if he has not
tied himself down ir the specification to the particular mode
described, he is entitled to be protected against all modes by
which the same result is produced, by an applicatioh of the same
law of nature or property of matter. - And'a fortiori,if he has

DECEM1BER TERM, .1852.

187

Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.
discovered the law of nature or property of matter, and applied
it, is he entitled to the patent, and aforesaid protection.
And why should not this be the law? The original conception - the novel idea in the one case, is the new application of
the principle or property of matter, and the new product in the
arts or manufactures- in the other, in the discovery of the
principle or property, and application, with like result The
mode or means are but incidental, and flowing naturally from
the original conception; and hence of inconsiderable merit.
But, it is said, this is patenting a principle, or element of nature.
The authorities-to which I have referred, answer the objection.
It was answered by Chief Justice Eyre, in the case of Watts's
patent, in 1795, fifty-seven years ago; and more recently in still
more explicit and authoritative terms. And what if the principle is incorporated in the invention, and the inventor protected
in the enjoyment for the fourteen years. He is protected only
in the enjoyment of the application for the special purpose and
object to which it has been newly applied by his genius and
skill. For every other purpose and end, the principle is free for
all mankind to use. And, where it has been discovered, as well
as applied to this one purpose, and open to the world as to
every other, the ground of complaint is certainly not very obvi-.
ous. Undoubtedly, within the range of the purpose and object
for which the principle has been for the first time applied, piracies
are interfered with during the fourteen years. But any body
may take it up and give to it .any other application to the
enlargemeiit of.the arts and of manufactures, -without restriction.
He is only debarred from the use of the new application for the
limited time, which the genius of others has already invented
.and put into -successful practice. The protection does not go
beyond the thing which, for the first time, has been discovered
and brought into practical use; and is no broader than that
extended to every other discoverer or inventor of a new art or
manufacture.
I own, 1 am incapable of comprehending the detriment to the
improvements in the country that may flow from this sort of
protection to inventors.
To hold, in the case of inventions of this character, that the
novelty must consist of the mode or means of the new application producing the new result, would be holding against the
facts of the caset as no one can but see, that the original conception reaches far beyond these. It would be mistaking the
skill of the mechanic for the genius of the inventor.
Upon this doctrine, some of the most brilliant and useful invezitions of the day by men justly regarded as public benefactors,
and whose names reflect honor upon their country -the suc-

188

SUPREME COURT,
Le Roy et al. v. Tatham et al.

cessful application of steam power to the propulsion of vessels
and railroad cars- the application of the electric current for the
instant communication of intelligence from one extremity of the
country to the other -and the more recent, but equally brilliant
conception, the propulsion of vessels by the application of the
expansibility of heated air, the air supplied from the atmosphere
that surrounds them. It would be found, on consufting the
system of laws established for their encouragement and protection, that the world had altogether mistaken the merit of their
discovery; that, instead of the originality and brilliancy of the
conception that had been finwittingly attributed to them, the
whole of it consisted of. some simple mechanical contrivances
which a mechanician of ordinary skill could readily have davxsed.
Even Franklin, if he had turhed thie ligLtning to account, in
order to protect himself from piracies, must have patented the
kite, and the thread, and the key, as his great original conception, which gave him a name throughout Europe, as -well as at
home, for bringing down this element from the heavens, and
subjecting it to the service of man. And if these simple contiivances, taken together, and disconnected from the control
and use of the element by which the new application, and
new and useful result may have been prcduced, happen to he
old and well known, his patent would be -void; or, if some follower in.the tract of genius, with just intellect enough to make
a different mechanical device or contrivance, for the shme control and application of.the element, and produce the same result,
he would, under this view of the patent lawV, entitle himself to
the full enjoyment of the fruits of Franklin's discovery.
If I rightly comprehend the ground upon which a majority
of my brethren have placed the decision, they do not intend to
controvert so much the doctrine which It have endeavored to
maintain, and which, I think, rests upon settled authority; as the
application of it to the particular case. They suppose that the
patentees have claimed only the combination of the different
parts of the machinery described in their specification, and
therefore, are tied down to the maintenance of that as the novelty of their invention. I have endeavored to show, that this is
a mistaken interpretation; and that they claim the combination, only, when used to embody and give a practical application
to the newly-discovered property in the lead, by mean' of which
a new manufacture is produced, namely, wrought pipe out of a
solid mass of lead; which it is conceded, was never before successfully accomplished.
For these reasons, I am constrained to differ with the judgment they have arrived at, and am in favo:: of affirming that of

RILLIEUX, DECEASED.
This court again decides, as in 11 Howard, 580, that under the acts of Congress of
1824 and 1844, the District Court had no power to act upon evidence of mere naked
possessioi, unaccompanied by written evidence conferring, or professing to confer,
a title of some description.
By the treaty of 1763, the land in question passed from France to Great Britain; and
the certificate of two French officers in 1765, certifying that the claimant had been
for a long time in possession, furnished no evidence of title. No application was
made to the British government for a grant.
A purchase from the Indians, whilst the province was under 'French authority, conveyed no title unless sanctioned by that authority.

In tl;is
c, ze, also, there is no proof that the claimants are the heirs of the party
originally in possession.

THIs was an appeal from the District Coiirt of the United
States, for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The petition
was filed in that court by the heirs of Rillieux, under the act
of June 17th, 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 676,) which court decreed in
favor of the petitioners. The United States appealed to this
court, where it was argued by 11-. Bibb and Mr. Crittenden,
(Attorney-General,) for the appellants. No counsel appeared
for the appellees.
Mr.Justice,CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
The petitioners aver, that they are the lawful heirs of Vincent
