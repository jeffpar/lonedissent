HERMAN,

PLAINTIFF IN ERROr, V. JAMES PHALEN;
SAME V. SAME.

The ease of League v. DeYonng and Brown, (11 Howard, 185,) considered and again
established.
THESE: two cases were brought up, by writ of error, from the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of
Louisiana, and were argued together by 11Mr. Allen and MTlr.
Ovid F. olinson for the defendant in error. No counsel appeared for the plaintiff in error.
The points in the case were argued in the case of League v.
DeYoung, 11 Howard, 188, to which the reporter refers.

Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
These two cases have been argued together snd depend upon
the same principles. They were decided in tue Circuit .Court,
before the opinion of this court was pronounced in the case of
League v. DeYoung dnd Brown, reported in 11 Howard, 185. In
that case, all of the questions which arise in the cases before us
were fully considered and decided; and that decision is adverse
to the doctrines now contended for by the defei dant in error.
Upon reviewing the olinion in League v. DeYoung and Brown,
We see no reason for changing it in any respect; and these two
cases must therefore be reversed, and a mandate issued to the
Circuit Court, directing the judgment in ea.ch of them to be
reversed, and the judgment entered for the plaintiff in error.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
