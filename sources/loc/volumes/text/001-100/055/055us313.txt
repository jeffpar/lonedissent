such circumstances, it cannot be said that the act was done by
the consent or will of the complainants, at all. The court, in
vacating the decree, were correcting an error both of fact and
of 'law; and, during the term at which it was rendered, they had
full power to amend, correct, or vacate it, for either of these
reasons.

2. The second point is equally without foundation. It is
true, that the answers of the respondents denied fraud in the,
abstract, but they admitted all the facts and circumstances
necessary to constitute it, in the concrete. The general denial
of the answer, only showed that the definition of fraud was
much narrower, in the estimation of the respondents, than in
that of courts of law and equity. In this case, a verdict was
wholly unnecessary, to inforirf the conscignce of the Chancllor;
and, the verdict being perfectly correct, the court very properly
refused to set it aside, on any.representation from jurors thus
obtained.
Any argument to vindicate the correctness of the verdict and
the decree of the court below, after the exhibition of the merits
of this case, which we have given, would be entirely superfluous.
The decree of the District Court of Texas, is therefore
affirmed,
Order.
This cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the
record, from the District Court of the -United States for the
Distict of Texas, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreeI , by
this court, that the decree of the said District Court in this
cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.

Releases given by the complainants, in the present case, decided to cover the matters
in controversy, and, therefore, to put an end. to all claim by them; inasmuch as
thero is no proof that they were obtained by fraud or circumvention.

same parties, at January term, 1848, is reported in 6 Howard,
206. It came up again at January term, 1849, and is reported
in 7 Howaid, 160. Again, at December term, 1851, a dispute,
growing out of the same matters, was before this court,' and
the judgment of the court below affirmec. by a divided court.
Consequently, it was not reported; but the mandate, which was
issued therein, gave rise to a difficulty, which will be the subject
of the succeeding case in this volume. Ewing and wife were
parties, together with Fourniquet and wife, to the present suit,
but the controversy cannot be distinctly understood, without a
reference to the case in 7 Howard, 160. The family connection of the parties is there explained.
The present claim of Fourniquet and wife, and Ewing and
wife, against Perkins, was founded on the alleged rights of the
marital community of Mrs. Perkins (the mother of IHarriet
and Anne) with Mr. Perkins,, according to the laws of Lo isiana.
â€¢ The bill alleges the marriage was consummated in Louisiana,
where both the widow Bynum and the de:endant Perkins were
then citizens; and that the defendant always retained his legal
and political domicil in Louisiana, though some time after the
marTiage, for the ostensible purpose of haealth, established a
family residence near Natchez, in the State of Mississippi. The
bill charges, that defendant, during the marriage, expended of
community 'funds, in the State of Mississippi, in permanent investments of real estate, an amount of about $39,600, which
remained in kind at the dissolution of the marriage by the deat'
of his wife in' 1824, but which he has since sold and disposed ot
to his own use. That defendant had no ravenues or resources
in Mississippi from which these investments were made; but
it was all derived from the revenues of his and his wife's
property and cotton estates in Louisiana, and were partnership
funds, in which complainants, as heirs of their mother's commnunity, had rights of partnership, and ncw have right to hold
defendant to account therefor. They charge, that if defendant
intended and expected to get an advantage to himself, by investing the community funds in the State of Mississippi, rather
than in Louisiana, then it was a fraud on his part, for which
he is liale; or, if intended in good faith, yet such investment
charged defendant with a trust, for which they pray he may be
held responsible.
But complainants aver, that as defendant has heretofore kept
back and concealed from settlemet t this investment and neVer
accounted for the same, but in settlement with them obtained
their, receipts and release in full, in which this matter was not
included, that said releases, so far as they may be invoked to

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

815

Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

bar this claim, were obtained by fraud and circumvention. And
they declare the matters of this bill were kept back by defendant, and never accounted for. And they call on defendant to
produce the account and items rendered by'him when he obtained these releases, and show for what they were given.
They aver, too, that Harriet's release was given while she was,
yet a minor.
They pray for an account of proceeds, or amount of said investment, with eight per cent. interest, and for general relief.
Answer.
Defendan't, in his answer, adnits the marriage in Louisiana,
admits the parties, and admits substantially the inVestments
made in the State of Mississippi. But qualifying and explain.
mg, says: That.same year of the marriage he and his wife removed to the State of Mississippi, and continued their domicil
there during all the time of their married life, which terminated
by the death of his wife on the 12th August, 1824. That'this
removal was in pursuance of an understanding had between
them before marriage with a view to health, and facilities of
educating the children. Admits he-retained some political rights
in Louisiana after his removal till 8th of June, 1821; but says
his civil domicil was changed as aforesaid, and on this allegati6n
predicates his first and principal ground of defence, viz., that
by reason of this domicil "respondent has afways acted under
the belief that there.was no community of acquets and gains
of property, lying in Louisiana, between respondent and his
said wife under the laws of Louisiana."
As a second ground of defence, he submits, also, that if, as
alleged in said bill, the domicil was not changed, yet, as head of
the community, he was entitled to the absolute di posal of the acquets and gains, without accoulitability to his wife, or her legat
representatives.
As a third ground of defence, denies that the investments in
Mississippi were made with money to which his wife had *iy
legal or equitable title whatever. And denies they were malf
to gain any unjust advantage over his wife or her lheirs.
Fourth point"of defence is matter in abatement, in which defendant assumes, that if liable to the deniadd made in said bill,
it is only to an administrator of his wife's estate, and not to
the complainants.
Fifth ground of defence is, that he has ottained the releases
of complainants for all claims on account of the estate of their
father and mother, and relies upon them. as if formally plead in
bar, denying they were obtained by fraud or concealment.

816

SUPREMEB

COURT.

Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

Sixth ground of defence submits that if said investments
were made with money in which his wife had an interest, yet
that defendant is entitled to the property, as tenant hy curtesy
during his natural life; and he interposes this right as if plead
in bar.
Upon the final hearing, the Circuit Court passed the following
decree':
In Chancery. Final Decree.
The report of William H. Brown, Master in Chancery, made
in the above-stated case, and flied herein on the 3d day of April
A. D. 1850, having been confirmed on a former day of this
term; and the report of said Master made herein and filed on
the first day of October, A. D. 1850, having also been confirmed
on a former day of this term, except as to the said sum of five
hundred dollars therein stated as having been paid by defendant
subsequent to the death of Mrs. Perkins, wife of said defend-ant: It is now thereupon further ordered, adjudged, and decreed,
-that the said complainants, the said Harriet J. Fourniquet, together with the said Edward P. Fourniquet. in right of his said
wife, but to her sole and separate use; and the said Ann S.
Ewing, together with the said Martin W. Ewing, in right of
hissaid wife, but to h~r sole and separate use, do have and recover of the. said defendant, John Perkins, the amount stated in
said first.named .report, to wit, the sum of sixteen thousand nine
hundred and sixty-eight dollars and seventy-six cents ($16,968.76,) to be paid to the said complainants by the said defendant
-within thirty days hereafter, together with interest thereon at
the rate of eight per cent. per annum, from the first day-of April,
1850, or in default thereof that said complainants have execution therefor. It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that
-said complainants do recover of the defendant all their costs
hereby in this suit incurred and herein taxed.

November 20, 1850.
From this decree Perkins appealed to this court.
Itwas argued by Mr. .Tohnson and Mr.Soule, for the appellant,
and Mro Jenderson,for the appellees.
It is not necessary to state the points and arguments of the
counsel relative to the community of acquets and gains under
the law of Louisiana, and how far that l1w would reach investments in Mississippi; but as the decision of the court
turned entirely -apon the validity of the releases (one of which
is inserted in 7 Howard, and both in the present. opinion,) the
notice of the argument will be confined entirely to that subject.

DECEMBER

TERM, 1852.

817

Perkins v. Fourniquet.et al.
The counsel for the appellant considered the releases in the
following point of view:
The bill charges-that these releases were obtained by concealment, fraud, &c. The answer denies the charge in the most
positive terms, and not a shadow of proof has been given of its
truth.

The releases themselves are as full and thorough acquittances
of all responsibility on the part of the respondent, as could have
been drafted, as will be seen by reference thereto.
To the release of E. P. Fourniquet and wife to J. Perkins,
dated Natchez, May 27, 1834.
To the release from M. W. Ewing and wife, dated April 11,
1828.
To the release of Benjamin S. and Mary C. Bynum, (heirs,
but not parties to this suit,) April 10, 1829.
Act of confirmation by Mary C. and Thomas P. Eskridge,
dated April 9, 1832.
For what ,vcr-e these releases made? Surely not to cover the
land and slaves in Louisiana of the deceased parents of the
releasors, because there had been previously (in 1827) a judicial
partition and distribution of Their patrimonial estate, which had
been homologated, and had all the force of "the thing adjudged;" and Perkins had been fully discharged before any of
these releases were executed. Then, these releases must have
been wholly supererogatory in reference to the land and slaves
in Louisiana; and the que.:tion arises, what could they have
been designed to cover and include, unless it were such personal
effects as may have remained, after all the debts and expenses
of the marriage and the education and maintenance of the
Bynumn heirs had been defrayed?
As to the validity mdnd effect of these releases, one of them
has been attested and adjudicated, not only in the Ninth Judicial District of Louisiana, and before a jury, but in the Sunreme
Court of the United States.
Howard's Reports, vol. 7, contains the recitals, in Mr. Justice
Daniel's opinion, slowing that Fourniquet and wife sued Perkins
for large amounts of property, spoliations, &e., in Concordia,
Louisiana, in December, 1838, and that judgrient was rendered against them in December, 1840; and that, having brought
suf
qgainst him in 1844, in the United States Circuit Court for
LToui.4iana, Perkins plieaded that judgment in bar, and prevailed
both in the Circuit and Supreme Courts of the United States.
True, the opinion of Judge Daniel was rejected, as evidence, in
the United States Circuit Court for Mississippi; but whether the
objection was well taken or not, the weight of it, as an argument and an authority directly in point, could not be destioyed,

In
In
Mr. Henderson, for the appellees.
We come next to consider the question: of the receipts and
releases, interposed in bar.
The bill charges fraud and concealment in obtaining from
complainants these receipts, and declares the matters sought to
be recovered in this suit, were not, at the time of these receipts,
or at any other time, ever accounted for, bu.t by defendants were
concealed and kept back; and they require and demand of defendant, should he offer said receipts in bar, that he produce the
account, and the items thereof rendered, for which said receipts
were given.
The defendant tenders the relebses as exhibits, with his answer, and states that he "relies uponi said releases as if formally
pleaded in bar," and denies, generally, they were obtained by
fraud or concealment. They are found in the record, but in
no form of plea. Now, while rule 39 permits a defendant to
avail himself in his answer of matters in bar, if the matter be
such as could be plead in bar, yet the rule does not allow that
to subserve as a bar in an answer, which could not have been
plead in bar. The alleged release of Harriet Fourniquet is not
good in bar, because the deed of a married woman, not proven
or acknowledged on privy examination, and therefore void.

This release is void, also, because executed by her while a

319

Perkins v.Fourniquet et al.
answer to interrogatory 4. Her subsequent recognition of it,
before a Judge in Louisiana, (not'on private examination,) gave
it no additional validity. Void as the deed of a married woman
in its execution, it cojuld not be validated by her subsequent
recognition of it.
The receipt of Ewing and wife is not under seal, and therefore not good in plea, of bar as a release. Story, Eq. Pl. Â§ 796;
Mit. P1. marg. 263.
But complainants have impeached, by their bill, the integrity
of these receipts, so far as offered by defendant to evidence a
release, or settlement, of the community sued for, and call upon
defendant for a disclosure of the consideration on which they
were executed.
The defendant denies fraud generally in their procurement,
but makes no disclosure of the matters or accounts settled by
the receipts. Nor does he venture to affirm they were given on
settlement of the community; yet tenders them as "releases, as
if formally pleaded in bar," notwithstanding.
Such form of pleading and issue make no ground of defence,
and must be overruled and disregarded, as if not in the record.
Story, Eq. P. Â§ 796, 797; Mit. Pl. marg. 261, 262, 263.
If it be said, however, that these receipts were executed for
the meridian of Louisiana, and not intended for common-law
instruments, (though both made in Mississippi,) their deficiency
in this aspect is still more palpable. For, professing to evidence
the settlement of Perkins's account as tutor or guardian of the
Bynum heirs, they are "null and void," because they do not
show, on their face, that a full account and a delivery of
vouchers was rendered the wards, ten days previous to signing
the receipts. 0. C. 72, art. 76; 4 How. U. S. R. 51 ; C. 0.
art. 35; 4 Rob. 296, 297.
And the civil-law doctrine of "transactions" and "remission"
of debts, was never extended, and will not be in equity, to settlements of guardians with their wards.
And the defendant's answer in this case is quite demonstrative, that he never settled in any way -with complainants for their
mother's community. He says, "By reason of their domicil
being in the State of lississippi, respondent has alvays acted
under the belief, and now submits to the court, by way of defence to the claim of complainants, that there was no community of acquets and gains of property lying in Louisiana,
between respondent and his said wife Mary, under the laws of
Louisiana."
If there be any meaning in language, this surrenders the fact,
and admits the community not settled for.
For, if Perkins "always acted under this belief," he so acted

820

SUPREME COURT.
Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

-when he obtained these receipts. It is conclusive, therefore, he
did not settle with or compensate complainants for the community. And he waives such defence in this part of his
answer, by submitting the question of community or no community to the cour, and to abidg that issue. If he has bought
out this claim, why not show the evidence of his purchase, rather
than submit the issue to the court that it never existed?
But the receipt of Ewing and wife is also express and conclusive, against this pretence of defendant. It particularly and
exactly enumerates -what things were settled for, and what he
received. And by reference to the inventories returned by Parkins himself, the eighteen slaves, specified in the receipt, are found
in inventories. The cattle, mules, and tools, all are there shown,
and all of the Bynum estate. There can be no mistake in this
proof. And it was no such grace on Perkins's part, that he
relaxed his hold on this fraction of their father's estate, as thereby to absolve himself from commdnity.
But the record, elsewhere, abounds with evidence on this point.
On pages 71 to 76, defendant sets forth the several parcels of
land purchased by him .chiefly in Louisiana, during the coverture; and all such are community lands, if a marital partnership
existed. And Mrs. Perkins's children were jointly seised of the
title with him, at the instant of her death. Now can such receipts as here exhibited, by any stretch of presumption, be regarded as transmissive of their joint title, with Perkins, to these
lands? Even if intended as such, they obviously fail as relinquishments of title to real estate.
But had this been the purpose, it is incredible of belief, they
would have been so executed.. For the title which the heirs of
Mrs. Perkins have in her community, would sustain an ejectment
against Perkins, or even against a third possessor under Perkins
without notice. See 5 An. Rep. 389; 2 Id. 261.
Now these Mississippi investments of $29,000, were but part
of the whole, and with like certainty were not accounted for in
these receipts.
They do not show they included or comprehended the comreunify, but we think on their face they reasonably show the
contrary, and the defendant shrinks from the averment that they
did or do include it. He offers no proof that they did, and he
evades reply, when called on to show the matters and things on
which they rested, and says he always acted under the belief
there was no community, and submits that issue to the court.
Aside from their defective execution to make them releases, and
apart from the mispleading them in bar, we think it impossible
to believe they did settle for community, or were intended, by
those -who gave them, to comprehend that subject.

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

321

Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

The rule iA equity, and of the most common justice, then applies, that these receipts shall be held valid only for the matters
and things on which they computed. And this, with such legal
distrust as the relations of the parties imply. 10 How. 185, 186;
8 How. 158; 4 How. 561; 16 Pet. 276, 7, 8, 9; 2 Sum. 11; 3
St6ry, R. 268, 9; 1 Ed. Ch. R. 38, 39; 1 Ch. & Let. 226.
The case of Fourniquet and wife 7).. Perkins, (7 How. 160,) is
referred to and relied on as deciding these receipts valid against
us. But the case quoted decides no such principle. It sustained
a plea of resjudicata. And the case plead in bar, did interpose
these receipts, among other matters of defence, in a suit brought
exclusively to obtain against Perkins a new account of his administration of the Bynum estates, but not for community. We
were defeated in that case. And Judge Daniel said, from inspection of the record, that it did not appear we were defeated
merely on the receipts, but on the merits. We admitted then,
and admit now, these receipts were given to close Perkins's administration of the Bynum estate, but not community in the
Perkins estate. The decision of that case does not therefore
touch these receipts. They have only been decided in this case
below, and in the case of Perkins v. Foiirniquet et al. (6 How.
206); and in both decisions it has been held that these receipts
did not7 bar this action for community.
One other, and the last point, on this subject. Both these receipts recite and count on administrative settlements, by Perkins,
of Benjamin Bynum's estate, or of Mrs. Perkins's separate estate,
in his capacity of guardian, curator, or executor.
Now it is familiar to the jurisprudence of Louisiana, as shown
in the decisions herein quotedi that the formal and official administration of the wife's estate extends only to her separate
estate, and not to her community. Perkins, in this case, as surviving partner, would, and did, have the settlement of commu*nity,and not as curator of the Bynurm estate, or as administrator or executir of his wife's estate. His right, power, and duty
to settle the community, resulted wholly and -exclusively from
his being the surviving partner in community. And his accountability for the wife's share in community was directed With
her heirs, and not her administrator. And this is manifest from
the right of the heirs to renounce community. 0. C. 338, arts.
72, 75, 82, 84.
And there is no fact or circumstance in this case that points,
in the remotest degree, to any settlement made by Perkins as
surviving partner of the community. No partition with the
heirs is shown; no purchase from them of their undivided portion is shown; and, upon all known principles of human action,
it is impossible to believe that either of these things was 4one,

322

Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

and being done, that the evidence of It -was incorporated in
these receipts.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of MIississippi, the District Judge presiding.
The suit was brought in the Vice-Chancery Copurt of Mississippi, and was transferred to the Cireuit ,Court, upon the application of the respondent, under the 12th section of the act of,
September 24th, 1789, to establish the judicial courts of the
United States.
Harriet J. Fourriquet and Anne I. Eh ing are the stepdaughters of the respondent, from his intermarriage with their
mother, Mary Bynum. She was the widow of their father,
Benjamin Bynum.
The object of the suit was to recover their portion of $39,600,
alleged by them to be marital community gains of the respondent and their mother, which they charge he invested in Mississippi, and was in hand at the death of their mother. The
respondent is charged with having had no means of his own to
make such investments; that the money was derived from the
cotton estate in Louisiana; that*the same, by the laws of that
State, became a community of acquets and gains, one half of
which, upon the death of their mother, became theirs and her
other heirs; and they charge him, further, with having fraudu.
lently taken the money derived from the Louisiana property, info
Mississippi, to invest it there, in order to give him undue advantages over his wife's and their interest in the fund. It is said,
that at the death of their mother there were then living four children of the first husband, and three by the respondent. Three
of the four and two of the three are still living. 1\1ary B. Eskridge, one of the survivors of the Bynum children, and John
Perkins and William Perkins, adults and ,heirs of the complainant, do not concur with them in their suit, and for that
reason are not made parties. The respondent, besides being
charged generally with fraud, is especially so in reference to
certain receipts and releases, which these cDmplainants gave to
him, which they now say were obtained by concealment and
circumvention.
The respondent, in. his answer to the bill, admits his marriage
in Louisiana, at the time and place stated. That he removed
to Mississippi with his wife in 1818; that their'domicil was
there continued to be kept during the coverture, and that their
removal was not only with the consent of the wife, but in pursuance of an understanding between them before their marriage

DECEMBER TERM, 1852.

323

Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

took place. He denies thaf any community of gains was established conventionally, or that it legally could occur 4nder the
law of Louisiana, on account of the residence of himself and
wife in that State when they were married, because it was their
intention, before the marriage took place, to remove into Mississippi. He denies that any money, invested by him in lands
in Mississippi, belonged, either legally or equitably, to his
wife in either State; and 'asserts, even if there was a marital
community between them, he was entitled to dispose of the
Eains as he pleased, without any liability, under the law of
ouisiana, to account for the same to his wife or her representatives. He denies the charge, that be was without productive
property or available means to purchase the property in Mississippi. That property consists of several tracts of flnd and the
improvements put upon them, as is said, by community funds.
The tract upon which the improvements were put contained one
hundred acres. It was bought from Arthur Mahan, on the 30th
October, 1818, for $9,926. It was improved for a residence for
the respondent with his family, including thechildren of the wife
by the first husband. There was another tract, containing
2,100 acres, bought by the respondent from Elihu Hall Bay, in"
January, 1819, for $5,000. There were two other purchases,one of them, a lot in Natchez, bought from Walter . Parker, in
March, 1823, for $600; and the other is a purchase from Sugar
Zenor,'in March, 1824, for $1,000. The aggregate sum given
for these lands, and the improvements upon the first, amount to
$39,600. The complainants allege, that they have a right to
elect to take their interest in them in money, with interest upqn
the amount from the time of their mother's death.
To this answer, the complainants filed the general replication.

The case was tried, and the court below gave an interlocutory
decree against the respondent. It declares that a community of
gains had e.xisted between the respondent and his wife during
the marriage. That its resources were altogether in Louisiana,
and that the respondent had invested from the gains large sums
in the purchase and improvement of real estate in Mississippi,
and that it was held by him, in 1824, when the marriage was
dissolved by the death of Mrs. Perldns. The court also referred
the matter to a master, to take an account conformably to its
decree. In the course of the reference, the master sustained an
objection to an allowance for which the complainants contended.
It wa submitted to the court, whether he had properly refused
it. He was instructed, that it was only necessary for him to
ascertain the amount of the funds vested by the rpspondent in
Mississippi during the community; and that, as to the sodree

SUPREME COURT.
Perkins v. Fourniquet et al.

from which Perkins derived them, the court would decide under
all the proof. The master proceeded accordingly. He reported,
'without any proof of the source from which Mr. Perkins obtained the money, that $16,968.76 was due to the complainants.
The report was subsequently confirmed, and the court gave a
final decree for them for the sum just stated, with interest, at 8
per cent. from the 1st April, 1850.
It does not appear that the court's attention had been particularly directed to the rdleases which the complainants admit
they gave to the respondent, and which lie says were given to
him with a positive denial of the statement, that he obtained
them by fraud, concealment, and circumvention.
If it had been, we think that the court would have determined
the effect of the releases upon the case before it gave its interlocutory decree, and that it would not have made a final decree
upon the master's report.
We proceed to give our 'view of these releases.
The first, from Ewing and wife, was executed on the 11th
April, 1828. Fourniquet and wife executed theirs on the 27th
May, 1834, within a month of six years after the other.
They are as follows:
Release from B. P. Fourniduetet vtx. to John Perkbis.
Received, Natchez, May 27th, 1834, of John Perkins, on settlement of all accounts, debts, dues, and d&mands, whatever, up
to the present day, one hundred dollars in full, having, on a previous occasion, received from him, as the guardian of my wxife,

The operative words of these releases are as full as they can
be, and they cover the subject-matter for which the complainants
brought the suit.
*We have carefully examined and considered this record, without finding in it any thing against the fairness of the releases.
The complainants do not give any proof against it. Nothing is
in proof from which it can be inferred that they were given in
ignorance of their rights in the estates of Benjamin S. Bynum
and Mary Bynum when the releases were made, or that they
were in any way circumvented by the respondent. Their testimony in the case is exclusively upon the community of gains,

SUPREME COURT.
Perkins v. Fourniquet e! al.

and upon the inability of the respondent to make such purchases
and improvements from his own means.
It consists of copies of conveyances for the property bought,
of depositions, in which there is not a word 'elating to the releases, and of answers by the rgspondent to other suits against
him, one of which was a suit in equity brought by these complainants in the Circuit Court of the United States, in Louisiana.
In that answer may be found a narrative of the respondent's
business connection, and dealings with the estate of B6njamin
S. Bynum and that of his -ridow, afterwards the wife of the
respondent. It shows that he rendered an account of both.
That it was done in an open manner and with an intention that
it should be examined by those who were interested. It is
further shown, that after the accounts had been officially filed,
that there was a partition of all the property among the heirs,
and that it was consummated by receipts and acquittances
from all of them, among them those given by Ewing and his
wife, and by Fourniquet and his wife, as they have been already
recited in this opiniofi. The respondent also denies in that
answer the charge there made by these complainants, as it is
repeated in this suit, that these acquittances were obtained by
fraud, misrepresentation, and concealment, and avers that they
were executed by the parties with a full knowledge of all their
rights, and for a valuable consideration. In that case, as in this,
there was no proof that those receipts or releases were fraudu-"
lently obtained. The witnesses, Henderson, Montgomery, and
Walworth, in this suit, are not questioned as to the execution
of the releases. The same interrogations were put to all of
them. The answers of each are very immaterial for any purposes in this suit, No one 'f them knew any thing concerning
the respondent's pecuniary situation when he married, or when
he removed into Mississippi, or of the sources from which'the
money came which was invested in Mississippi. The same
may be said of Wren's testimony. Loria's testimony is as
indefinite as that of the others, and lie also was not questioned
concerning the execution of the releases. On the other hand,
the evidence produced by the respondent in this suit, shows that
the releases were not precipitately made. That neither of the
complainants gave them until after they had had time to examine
his accounts, and not until they had examined them. Whatever.they may have thought of the integrity of the respondent,
they did not act then as if they suspected it. We see them
receiving from him their portions of the estates, of which they
w're 4istributees, and'other property besides, as gratuities from
the respondent, and dealing with both, among themselves and
with others, and acting towards the respondents as if they were

content with what he had done, and with what they had ieceived.
There was al interval of live years and eleven months between the releases given by the complainants to the respondent.
The accounts upon which they were given, were all that time
accessible to them. The proofs :how that Ewing had scanned
them before he gave his release. His interest in the estates
were the same as Fourniquet's. It was a family business, talked
of, no doubt, among themselves, as such matters always will be,
and it cannot be supposed that Fourniquet took his wife's portion of the estates without knowing that Ewing had given to
the respondent a release when he took his wife's part, or without
having had the same means as his associate to lean the condition of the estates, and the truthfulness of. the respondent's
official statement of them. Their acceptance of the portions
of their wives must be taken as an admission that the respondent
had dealt fairly in the business, and that he meant to do so,
unitil they shall prove that it was his design to cheat all of the
heirs, including his own children, as well as the wives of the
complainants. He may not have acted in his long management
of the estates, with all caution and exactness, but not~ling haq
been shown in this case, in his final settlement with the heirs,
that he did not mean to act with fairness and liberality, or that
any one of them did not think he had done so, when they made
these releases.
With the view of these releases, we think that the court erred
in giving its interlocutory order for an account to be taken. We
are relieved by it from considering the points which were made
in the argument concerning any community of gains between
the respondent and his wife. However that may have been, the
releases put an end to all controversy between these parties
about it. They were fully argued by counsel, as they should
have been, as they could not foresee what would be our view
upon the effect of the releases. We could not add any thing to
the decisions of the courts of Louisiana upon connubial or
legal communities of gains between husband and wife.
We are satisfied, whether it did or did not exist, that the
releases given by the complainants are conclusive against them
for any claim upon the respondent on account of the estates in
which they were interested. No proof having been given that
these releases were obtained by any fraud or circumvention, we
shall order the decree of the court below to' be reversed, and
that the bill of the complainants shall be dismissed.
Mr. Justice CURTIS dissented.

The sLxty-second rule of this &ourt, (13 Howard,) is as follows: "In cases where a
" writ of error is prosecuted to the Supreme Court, and the judgment of the inferior
court is affirmed, the interest shall be calculated and levied from the date of the
judgment below, until the same is paid, at the same rate that similar judgments
bear interest, in the courts of the State where such judgment is rendered. The
Same rule shall be applied to decrees for the payment of money, in eases in' Chancery, unless otherwise ordered by this court. This rule to take effect on the first
day of December term, 1852.
'Before this rule, interest was to be calculated at six per cent., from the date of the
judgment in the Circuit Court to the day of affirmance here; and the confirmation
of the report of the clerk, in the case ofÂ£ Mitchell v. Harmony, (13 Howard, 149,J
- was under the rules then existing.
So, also, where a case from Mississippi was affirmed at December term, 1851, the
mandate from this court should have been construed to allow interest at six per
-eent. from the date of the decree in the court below, to the date of the affirmance
in this court. Therefore, it was erroneous either to allow six*per cent. until paid,
or to allow the current rate of interest in Mississippi, in addition to the six per cent.
allowed by this court.
The several rules upon this subject examined'and explained.

THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of Mississippi.
It is stated, in the report of the preceding case, that, at December term, 1851, a case of Fourniquet and wife, against Per'kins, came up from Mississippi, and the decree of the Circuit
Court was here affirmed by a divided court. It was, therefore,
not reported.
The proceedings under the mandate, and the questiuva which
arose thereon, are set forth in the following opinion of the
court:

It appears, in this case; that on the 22d of May, 1849, the
