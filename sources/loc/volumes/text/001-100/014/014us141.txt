]A 16.

This is an appe-l from a decree rendered in the

Tl
Taylor

circuit- court of Kentucky, directing the' appellaht
to convey to the" appellees, lahds lying within his
patent, which the app~elleet claimed by virtue of a
junior patent.
In all such cageg the validity of the entry which
is the foundatioh of the title of the junior patentfee is
first to be examified.
This entry was made on the 4th of December,
1783, and -ali's to begin ",in the fork of Chaplin's, fork; and the Beech fork, and to run thence up
Beech fork to the mouth of the first large creek,
which is called, &t., thence'to run up the cieek and
iup Chaplin's fork till a lind run straight across will
include the quantity to exclude prior legal claims."
The places called for being proved to have been
places of notoriety which could not be mistaken, n6
want of certainty can be ascribed to this location, unless it be produced by the words ."to exclude prior'
legal claims." These words are obviously attached
to the qiAntity, not to the beginning, or to the lines
bounded by the creeks. They canthen affect only
the back line, which is to extend from one creek to
the other. The locator seeths to have supposed
that this line might approach towards, or recede
from, the point of juriction between the two creeksi
as the amount of prior legal claims might require;
that a' location could adapt itself to circumstances,
could assimilate itself td An elastic substance, and.
contract or expand as might secure the quantity of
land it sought to appropriate. In this he was mistaken. The boundaries of an entry must be Aixed

precisely by its own terms, and cannot depend on
previous appropriation. So much of this 'entry,
therefore, As would so extend the bak line as to
cow prehend, in one event, more land thari.the quantity mentioned in the location, is utterly void. Tha
back line must rwn as it would run if all the land was
vacant. But it would be unreasonable that this
futile attempt to extend the back line further than
it is by law extendible, should destroy an entry, in
all other respects certain. Accordingly, the courts
of Kentucky, so far as their decisions are unde,stood, have rjected such words as surplusage.
The entry of the appellees being good, it obviously comprehends, and has been surveyed to comprehend, the land of the appellant, and, this bridlgs
us to the consideiation of hi title.
The appellant claims under an, entry made by
John Pinn, the 13th of May, 1780, in these words,
"John )inn enters 2,000 acres of land by virtue of
a treasury warrant, on the dividing ridge. between
Chaplin's fork and waters of the Beech fork, about
one and a half miles north of a buffalo lick, on a creek
water of the Beech fork; about 25 miles from Harrodaburgh, and to extend eastwardly and westwardly for quantity."
The plaintiffs below allege, in their bill, that this
entry is void on account of its uncertainty, that the
survey is unlawful and contrary to the location, and,
therefore, pray that the larW so surveyed and patent-ed may be conveyed to them. The circuit court
determined that the entry was void, and decreed
according to the prayer of the bill, From this de-

are several other small licks on the creek, and one,
a tolerable large one, lying on the south fork, . different creek from Long Lik; but no othqr than this
was called a buffalo lick.

In a subsequent part of

his deposition he is asked whether this lick was a
place of notoriety in 1780, and answered, that he
knew nothing about it at that time. This must be
intended for the month of May, 1780, one mondL
sooner than the date of his knowledge, or is a positive contradicfion to his first assertion.
James Raig says, that this lick was generally
known by the hunters about Harrodsburgh, prior to
the month of May, 1780; that he encafnped. at'it
with three hunters, in the summer of 1776, and hunted about there; that there are several other licks in
the neighbourhlood, but no other buffalo lick; that
its reputed distance from Harrodsburgh, in 1781 or
1782, was about 25 -miles.
This is all the -testimony respecting the notoriety
of the buffalo lick called for in Penn's entry. Did
the validity of this entry depend solely on the notoriety of the lick, a court would find some difficulty in
pronouncing it too obscure.an object to be noticed by
subsequeht locators.
But, admitting that the lick wants sufficient notoriety to fix of itself the place of Penn's entry, still,
it must be allowed to be an object easily found and
easily distinguished, by those who are-brought into
its neighbourhood by the other descriptive parts of
the entry. Let us, then, inquire, whether this entry
does contain such description, as would conduct a
subsequent locator into its neighbourhood.

If an object be called for as lying on a creek, s&,
described as to be distinguished and ascertained,;
twenty-five miles from a given place of general notofety,. which object has disappeared or cannot'

be fqund' it, is understood' to be settled', in Kentucky, that such location is not void for uncertainty,
but is to be surveyed at the distance of twenty-five
miles along the creek, from the place of departure.

If the object be fouhd and be identified, especially if
it be such an object as would readily attract atten-.
tion,-and be easily distinguished, exactness in the distance is not required. On such occasions the distance was, in fact, seldom measured by the lpcator,
and could not be measured in a straight line without
the, aid of a surveyor. The locator, in estimating
distances, where they are considerable, is governed.
by general computation-; and this is known to subsequent locators. Exactness of distance, then, is introduced for the purpose of giving certainty to locations, which can by no other means ke rendered
certain. Where the object called for is easily found.
and identified, the want of precision in distance will
not defeat the location, unless the difference between,
the actual and estimated, distance be such, as to mislead subsequent locators
James Ray says, that the estimated distance from
f-arrodsburgh to the. mouth of Hanger run was 27'
or 30 miles, and that the lick was about three miles
nearer than the mouth of,.Hanger run to Harrodsburgh. James Ray says, thiat the estimated distance'
from Harrodsburgh to the lick was about 25 miles,

line twentymiles and one quarter of a mile.
If this difference of distance could in such a case,
when unaided, affect the entry, yet 'there are other
circumstances which reliewz it from this difficulty.
From the lick to the mouth of-the creek on which
it must lie,.cannot, in a straight line; amount to two,
miles. Measured along its meanders, the distance is
about three miles. This fact is ascertained by the.
surveys' made of the two entries. The farthest
point. then, of this creek from Harrodsburgh, cnnot,
in a straight line, exceed twenty-two miles. But the
lick lies, not at the mouth of the creek, 'but on. the
creek. The locator must, then, search for it up the
creek, and nearer t HarrQdsbur'gh. The extent of
this search for such an "object as a buffalo lick, au
object, to which he must be led by traces of the buffalo, which are in themselves so.visible, so distinguisable, so readily found, cannot, without totally disregarding the whole system of Kentuckydeiisions, be
pronounced too great a labour tojbe imposed on a
subsequent locator. - He is brought to the mouth of
a creek, on which the object for which he searches
lies: the object must fie upthat creek, and cannot lie

blame attaches.
The lick being found, there is no difficulty in ascertaining its identity. The witndsses certainly say,
that there are many other licks on the same creek,,and the surveyor has laid down two others; but they
also say, that no other lick Was- a buffalo lick. It has
been stated and argued at the bar, that although
licks are of very different dimensions,..and the difference is immense between the extremes, yet the
gradations approach each other sb nearly, that the
exact line between them can scarcely be' drawn.
Admitting this to be true, yet there are licks which
are indubitably buffalo licks, there are others which
are as indubitably deer licks. Now, the witnesses
pronounce, positively, that this is. a buffalo lick, and
that the others are deer licks.' In 'addition to this,
it is nearest to the mouth of the creek, and fathest
from -tarrodsburgh; consequently, it is nea.rer 'the
distance required by the location.' There is no
doubt, then, respecting the identity of this lick.
The lick called for in Pinn's entry being found and
identified, there can be no difficulty in finding his
land. It lies one and a half miles due north of tWis
lick, on the dividing.ridge. The place at whiqh the
