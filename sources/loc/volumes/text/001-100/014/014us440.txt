APPEAL from the circuit court for the district of
Massachusetts. This was a vessel laden with flour,
and bound from Baltimore, to Lisbon, captured, and
finally corldemned by this court at- February term,
1814, for sailing under a license from the enemy.
The present case was that of the claimants ef a

per, and separate letters of instruction were given to
Patterson Hartshorne, the supercargo. But, in the
expectation, as was alleged, that in case of detention
the delay and expense would be less considerable if
the cargo appeared to be the property of one individnal, than if there should be several small claims,
one general bill of lading was signed to the owner
of the ship, and one general letcr of instruction was
given in his name to the supercargo, so as to make
the whole cargo appear to be owned by Mr. Griffith, the owner of the ship, and of a small part of the
cargo. At the May term, 1814, of the circuit court,
the property of the claimants was-condemned 'by
that court upon the ground that their covnsel had,
at the preceding term, entered into an agreement

with the captors that the decision of the supreme
court, as to Griffith's'claim, should conclude the rest.
Of this agreement the circuit judge had made a memorandurn in his minute book, but it was not entered
on the records of the court until the May term, at
which condemnation was pronounced, when it was
admitted by the claimants' counsel to havc 6een
made, and was recorded. From this last sentence
of condemnation, an appeal was taken to this court.

oame in both cases. The court of chancery will
grant a rehearing though the parties have entered
into an order by consent to abide the decree, and
not to appeal.a If a court of equity will do it, why
will not a court of prize, which is still more liberal in
its practice, do the -same thing? 2. Although farther
proof was ordered by the court below, it did not

on which a court of prize proceeds in confiscating
the property of a citizen for the offnce of sailing
with a license from the enemy, has its root in the
municipal code. It is but enforcing the rule of municipal law, as to allegiance, in a court of the law of
nations. Therefore, the party cannot be liable to a
penalty civiliter unless- he would have been liable
criminaliter: the presumption of law is, indeed,
against the party, but it is a presumption which will
bend to fact -'and there must be un actual participation, by knowing the fact, or a virtual participation
in neglecting to make the proper inquiries. If the
fact of trading with the enemy be a misdemeanor,
the scienter must be laid in the indictment; and it

the present claimants should abide that of thte ship
owner in this court was acknowledged by both parand
ties, and recorded nune pro tunc. It is impossible,
under the circumstances of this case, that it should
be a fact that the owners of the cargo did not know
the existence of the license; and, therefore, it is impossible for them to prove their ignorance of it. The
claimants are affected with knowledge, by the knowledge of their agents-tbe ship owner and the supercargo; but it is superfluous to discuss the question of
law, the facts are 'so clear.
MARSHALL, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the
court.
lÂ¥ixen the claimants, in this case, applied to the
circuit court to be .let in to farther proof, for the purpose of showing their ignorance of the fact that the
Hiramsailed under the protection of a British license,
the judge of that court considered the agreement oi
the parties that these causes should depend on the
fate of Griffith's claim, under which agreement the
sentence, that would otherwise have been pronounced
against them, was suspended until the decision of
the supreme court on that claim should be made, a,
having the same validity as if that agreement had
been entered, at the time, on the records of the court.
In that opinion, there having been no doubt respecting the fact, this court concurs. But this court is
also of opinion that if the agreement was made under a clear mistake, the claimants ought to be relieved from it, where it could be done without injury to
the opposite party. If a judgment be confessed

OF THE UNITED STATES.

under a clear mistake, a court of law will set that
judgment aside, if application be made, and the mistake shown while the judgment is in its power. An
agreement, made a rule of court, to confess a judgment cannot be stronger than a confession itself; and,
of course, a party will not be compelled to execute
such an agreement, but will be allowed to show
cause against the rule in a case where it was plainly
entered into under a mistake. If the judgment be
no longer in the power of a court of law, relief may
be obtained in chancery. Still more certainly will
an agreement, entered into in a suit originally depending in a court of chancery, be relaxed, or set
aside, if it be proved to the court to have been
entered into under a mistake. The case cited froni
Peere Williams is directly in point.
These principles are of universal justice, and of
universal obligation. They cannot apply with less
force to causes depending in prize courts than to
causes depending in other courts. The propriety,
then, of rejecting further proof in- this case, andof
condemning the property claimed by the appellants,
will ,end on the -clearness with which they show
the mistake under which the agreement was made,
and on their 'ability to support their case if that
agreement be set aside. If a real and substantial
difference exists between the case of the present
claimants, and that formerly decided by this court,
there will not be much difficulty in yielding to the
suggestion, supported, as it is, by the proof now offered, that this agreement was made without knowledge of that difference, and, consequently, by mis-

take. But the question then occurs, whether restitution ought to be decreed to them, if the obligation of the agreement be removed.
The claimants allege that, in point of fact, they
did not know that the Hiram sailed under a British
license, and the proof they offer goes far in supporting this allegation. It is admitted that ignorance of this fact will save from the forfeiture incurred by it, unless the claimants have such constructive notice as will preclude them from showing the
want of actual notice. It has been argued that the
transaction rendered Griffith the agent of the other
shippers, so as to infect their claims with his knowledge; that by consenting that their property should
be shipped in his name, it becomes liable to all the
risks to which it would have been exposed had it
been actually his. It has been also argued that
the supercargo is clearly the agent of the shippers,
and that his knowledge of the license being on board
is, constructively, their knowledge. The counsel for
the claimants endeavours to rescue his clients from
the effect of this constructive notice, by contending
that the principle of respondeat superior can never apply to a case of a criminal nature; that a license
works a forfeiture, because it is a breach of allegiance-an offence which cannot be imputed to a
person having no knowledge of the criminal act
which constitutes the breach of allegiance: and that
this principle has, in prize courts, been applied to
-cases punishable under the law of nations; not to
offences against the government of the captor and
captured.

OF THE UNITED STATES.

The court considers the sailing, under an enem-'s
license, as closely connected, in principle, with the
offence of trading with the enemy; in which case it
is believed to be incontrovertible, that the knowledge of the agent would affect the principal, although he might, in reality, be ignorant of the facts
Upon this ground, the sentence of the circuit court is
affirmed with costs.
