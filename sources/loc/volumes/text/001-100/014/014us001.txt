time belbre the month of May,.1810, put to live with
Mrs. Rankin, then residing also in Virginia, whose
husband was an officer in the marine corps, stationed.
in'the city of Washington, Mrs. R. was to keep
the girl for a year, and was to give her victuals and
clothes for her services. Some time in May, 1810,
Mrs. R. removed to Washington, and. brought the
petitioner with her) whether with or without the permission of Mr; Ball, is entirely uncertain. It was
probably, though not certainly, with his knowledge.
In Octobker, 1810, Mr. Ball married, and soon after
took the petitioner into his possessioni and carried
her home, he then residing in Virginia. Mrs. R.
gave her up, being of opinion, though the girl had
iremained with hel 'only seven or eight months, that
she was bound to give her up when required by hek
master. Mr. B afterwards removed'himself into the
city, and brought the petitioner with him. 'Upon
this'testimony the.counsel for the petitioner prayed
the court below to instruct the jury, that if they be-.
lieved, from the evidenacei that the defendant knew
of the intended importation of the petitioner by Mrs.
R., and did not object to' it, then. such importatioa
entitled the petitioner to her freedom; and, further,
that it was compet4nt to the jury to infer, from his
knowing of the importation, and not objecting to it,
that such importation was made with his congent.
This instruction the court refused.to give; but did
instruct the jury -that if they should be of opinion
that Mrs. R. was, at the time she brought the petitioner into the city of Washington, a citizen of he
United States coming into the city of Washingtol_

with a bonafide intention of settling therein, then her
importation of said slave was lawful, and did n6f entitle the petitioner to her fieelom, Whether the said
the conimportation were or were not made with
sent of the defendant. An exception was taken
-to this opinion, and the jury having found a verdict
for the defendant, on which judgment was rendered
by the court, the cause was broibght into this court
by writ of error.

BVI.

Key, for the plaintiff in error, and petitioner, cited
the act'of the assembly of Maryland, of 1796, c. 67
S. 1, 2., contending, that its true construction applied
only to bona fide owners, and pot to bailees or
hirers.
Law, contra, stated, that the domicil of the owner
had been in Virginia, and that she was a bona fide
emigrant from that state. Being a hirer of the slave,
she was pro hac vice owner.8 The act of assembly
must be construed to refer to both species of property, qualified and absolute. He referred to the
6th section of the act to show that a property may
be, in slaves, limited in point of time.
Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the Fek. 10t]
court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:
This cause depends on an act of the state bf
'aryland, which is in force. in the comity of
Washington. The first section of that statute enacts,
MArSHALL,

,%2 Black. Com. 254., and the civil law writers there cited.

Ball.

"that it shall not be lawful to bring into this state any
negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside
within this state ; and any person brought into this
stare contrary to this act, if a slave before, shall, thereupon, immediately cease to be the property of the per-.
son or persons so importing or bringing such slaves
within this state, and shall be free." The 2d section
contains a proviso in favour of citizens of the United
States coming into this state with a bona fide intenr
tion of settling therein, and bringing slaves with
them. The 4th section enacts, that "nothing in
this act contained shall be construed or taken to affect the right of any person or persons travelling or
soj6urning with any slave or slaves within this state,
such slave or slaves not being sold or otherwise disposed of in this state, but carried by the owner out
Qf the state, or attempted to be carried."
Thi4 act appears tt the court not to comprehend.
the case, now urider consideration. The expressions
of that part of the first section which prohibits the
importation of slaves, are restricted to cases of impqrtation "for sale or to reside in this state." The
petitioner was obviously not imported for sale, nor
is the court of opinion that the short time for which
ohe was to continue with Mrs. Rankin can satisfy the
words, "to reside within this state." The legislature
must have intended to prohibit a general residence,
pot a special limited residence, where the slave is to
remain for that portion of the year for which she was
hired that still remained.
If on this point the first section nf the act could

miove that doubt. It declares that "nothing in the
act contained shall be construed or taken to aff6ct
the right of any person travelling or sojourning with
or
any: slave or slaves within this state, such slave
slaves not being sold or otherwise disposed of in this
state, but carried by. the owner out of this state, or
attempted to be carried."
This section sufficiently explains the residence
contemplated by the 6gislature in the first section.
The term sojourning means something more than
"travelling, ' and applies to a temporary, as contradistinguished from apermanent,residence. The court
is also of opinion, that the act contemplates and
punishes an importation or bringing into the state by
the master or owper of the slave. This construction, in addition to its plain justice, is supported by
the words of the first section. That section declares,
that 0 a-person brought into this state as a slaye con-.
trary tQ this act, if a slave before, shall, thereupon,
cease to be the property of the person or persons so
importing-or bringing such slave within this state, and
shall be free." It is apparent, that the legislature had
in view the case of a slave brought by the owner,
since it. is the property of the person importing the
slave which is forfeited.
Upon the best consideration we have been able
to giye this statute, the court is unanimously of opinion, that the petitioner acquired no right to freedom
by having been brought into the county of Washington by Mrs. Rankin for one year's service, she having
been in the course of the year carried back to Virginia by her master,

V.

The circuit court appears to have considered the
case as coming. within the proviso of the 2d section.
If in this opinion that court were even to be thought
mistaken, the error does not injure the petitioner, and
is, therefore, no cause foi reversal. The court is
unanimously of opinion, that the judgment ought to
be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.

.Negro JOHN DAVIS et at. v. WooD.
Evidence by hearsay and general reputation is admissible only a3 to
pedigree, but not'to establish the freedom of the petitioner's ancestor, and thence to deduce his or her own.
Verdicts' are evidence between parties and privies only; and a record
proving the ancestor's freedom to have been established in a suit
against another party by whom the petitioner was sold to the present
defendint, is inadmisgible evidence to prove the petitioner's freedom

THis case was similar to the preceding, in which

the petitioners excepted to the opinion of the court
