give the Indians a right of property in ttie soil, but
2iierely the use and qajoyment of it. That the sue-.
ceeding legislatures, by the acts of 1784, 1786, and
1789, have changed this reservation for the use of
the Indians, and given unlimited access, for tne purposes of making entries and surveys "to all lands
not before specially located,". and io." all vacant
lands" within the limits of the.state. Consequently,
locations could be made, and grants issued to perfect
titles of lands..lying within the limits of the Indian
reservation.
Whether.the legislature had the power, or intendvd to give the Indians a rigbt of property in the soil,
-or merely the use "andenjoynment of it, need not be inquired into, nor decided,-by this court; for it is perfectly clear, that the 5th section of the act of 1783,
c; 2., prohibits .all persona from .making entries or
surveys for any lands within the bounds set apart
for-the Cherokee Indians, and declares all such entries and grants thereupon, if any should be made,
utterly void; They had the power, and have declared, unequivocally, an intention, to prohibit entries
from being made within those reservations. The
several acts of 1784, 1786, and 1789, although they
contain general expressions, which, if taken singly,
might seem to sanction entries and surveys for " all
lands not ibefore specially located," or to " all vacant lands ;" yet, when taken together, these gene-.

tribes. The reasoning used in tle case of Preston
v. Browder, applies with equal, if not greater, propriety, to this case. And, although at different periods different sections of these reservations have
been subjected to appropriation by entries and surveys, it has been in consequence of the several treaties with the Indians, by which the boundaries of the
reservations have been altered, arid the Indian claim
extinguished; but it is believed, that the mere extizguishment of the Indian title did not subject the
land to appropriation, until an act of the legislature
authorized or permitted it. Whatever doubts this
court might entertain on this subject, were they now
construing these laws upon the first impression, that
doubt would be removed on a view of the case of
Avery v. Strother, in the Reports in Conference, p.
431., decided by-the judges of the supreme court-of
North Carolina. This is a decision directly in point,
made by the supreme court of the state, construing
the laws brought into the view of this court, and is
decisive of this case. And , as this court have been
uniformly disposed to pay great respect to .he decisions of the state courts respecting titles to real es.
tate, this decision has iHs full influence on the present
question; and, therefore, the judgment of' the circuit
rourt is unanimously affirmed with costs.

Judgment affirmed.
