EX PARTE DUGAN.

[Sup. Ot.

Opinion of the court.

Theory of the objection is unfounded in fact, and upon
that ground it is overruled. The judgment of the Circuit
Court is, therefore,
.AEFIRmED WITH COSTS.

Ex PARTE DUGAN.
On a mere petition for a certiorari,the court, according to its better and
more regular practice, will decline to hear the case on its merits, even
though the counsel for the petitioner produce a copy of the record
admitted on the other side to be a true one. It will wait for a return,
in form, from the court below.

ON a petition for a certiorarito the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia to send up the record of their proceedings upon a habeas corpus issued from that court upon the
application of the petitioner, it was stated by Mr. J. H.
Bradley, counsel of the petitioner, that a copy of the record had
been obtained; and he asked this court, upon the admission
of the Attorney-General that the copy was a correct one, to
hear the case without a return from the court below. The
Attorney- General, on the other hand, while admitting the copy
of the record produced io be correct, moved the court, for
reasons which he laid, to continue the case.
BY THE COURT. We think it the better, as well as the
more regular practice, to await the return of the court below
before taking any action on the merits. The certiorariwill,
therefore, be now awarded. Upon the coming in of the
return the case will be regularly before us; and the motion
for continuance made by the Attorney-General will then be
disposed of.
ACTION ACCORDINGLY.
