GORDON V. UNITED STATES.
Statement of the case.

be construed not absolutely but reasonably with regard to
the circumstances of each particular case. Viewed in that
light, inevitable accident may be regarded as an occurrence
which the party charged with the collision could not possibly
prevent by the exercise of ordinary care, caution, and mari-

time skill.* Regarding these cases as sufficient to show that
a. collision resulting from the darkness of the night and
without the fault of either party, is properly to be regarded
as an inevitable accident, we forbear to pursue the investigation, and wish only to add that we have no doubt the case
was correctly decided in the Circuit Court.
The, decree of the Circuit Court is therefore,
AFFIRMED WITH 001Th-

GORDON v. UNITED STATES.
No appeal lies to this court from the Court of Claims.

Go.DoN, administrator of Fisher, presented a petition in
the Court of Claims of the United States, for damages. done
to him by troops of our Government, in the war of 1812 with
Great Britain. The Court of Claims decided against him,
and he appealed to this court. The case was argued in favor
of the night of appeal by Messrs. Gooderichand Winter Davis;
no counsel appearing on the other side. A majority of the
.ourt, however,t finding itself constrained to the conclusion
that,, under the Constitution, no appellate jurisdiction over
the, Court of Claims could be exercised by this court, and
intimating that the reasons which necessitated this view
might be announced hereafter-the term being now at its
close-the cause was simply
DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.
