SUPREME COURT.
Verden v. Coleman.

Our opinion is, that the decree of the high court of errors and
appeals of Mississippi should be affirmed, with costs.

SAMUEL VERDEN,

PLAINTIFF IN

ERROR,

V.

ISAAC

COLEMAN.

This court again decides that a decree upon a motion to dissolve an injunction in the
course of a chancery cause, and where the bill is not finally disposed of, is not such
a final decree as can be re-examined in this court, under the 25th section of the
judiciary act.

TmIs case was brought up from the supreme court of Indiana,
by a writ of error issued under the 25th section of the judiciary
act.
The case is explained in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by T3r. Gillett, for the plaintiff in error, no
counsel appearing for Coleman.
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL delivered the opinion of the court,
The plaintiff filed his bill in the circuit court of Benton
county, Indiana, sitting in chancery, to obtain a decree to cancel
a mortgage and the mortgage note, and also to restrain, by
injunction, the mortgagee from proceeding upon the power of
sale contained in the mortgage until the final hearing, and from
thence perpetually.
A temporary injunction was granted in vacation upon the usual
conditions, which was dissolved, on the coming in of the answers
upon the motion of the defendants, by the circuit court.
From the order dissolving the injunction there was an appeal
to the supreme court of Indiana, where, after argument, the
decree of the circuit court was affirmed. Upon this decree this
writ of error is prosecuted.
This court has repeatedly decided that a decree upon a motion to dissolve an injunction in the course of a chancery cause,
and where the bill is not finally disposed of, is not such a final
decree as can be re-examined in this court, under the terms of
the 25th section of the judiciary act of the 24th September, 1789.
McCollum v. Eager, 2 How. 61; Gibbons v. Ogden, 6 Wheat.
448.
The writ of error is dismissed.
