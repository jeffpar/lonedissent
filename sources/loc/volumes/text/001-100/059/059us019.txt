Kissell v. St. Louis Public Schools.

But if there was evidence of the demand, as alleged, and which
we do not doubt exists, yet it is only evidence of an open account
existing at the time of Joseph Meek's death, in 1838, and therefore subject to be barred by the act of limitations in Mississippi
barring such claims, if suit is not brought to enforce them within
three years next after the cause of action accrued.

The answers

of the administrator and heirs of Joseph Meek rely on the act
of limitations as a bar to relief, and which bar would necessarily
be allowed, if the cause was remanded, so that further evidence
might be introduced. As it now stands, however, there is no evidence of the demand, and therefore we order that the decree of
the circuit court shall be affirmed.

JACOB KISSELL, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. THE BOARD OF THE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE ST. Louis PUBLIc SCHOOLS.
The act of congress passed on the 13th of June, 1812, (2 Stats. at Large, 748,) reserved for the support of schools in the respective towns or villages in Missouri "all
town or village lots, out-lots or common-field lots, included in such surveys," (which

the principal deputy-surveyor was directed in a preceding section to make,) "which

are not rghtfuly owned or claimed by any private individuals, or held as commons
belonging to such towns or villages, or that the President of the United States may
not think proper to reserve for miltaT purposes, provided that the whole quantity
of landlands
contained
in the lots reserved shall not exceed one twentieth part of the
included in the general survey of such town or village."
whole

The act of 26th of May, 1824, (4 Stats. at Large, 65,) directed the individual claimants to present their claims within a specified time, after which the surveyor-general
was to designate and set apart the lots for the support of schools.
The act of 27th of January, 1831, (4 Stats. at Large, 435,) relinquished the title of the
United States in the above lots to the inhabitants of the towns, and also in the lots
reserved for the support of schools, to he disposed of or regulated as the legislature
of the State might direct.
In 1833, the legislature incorporated a board of commissioners of the St. Louis public
schools, and, in 1843, the surveyer returned a plat in conformity with the above
laws.
The title to the lots thus indicated by the surveyor as school lots enured to the benefit
of the school commissioners. Until the survey, the title was like other imperfect
titles in Louisiana, waiting for the public authority to designate the particular land
to which the title should attach.
The certificate of the surveyor is record evidence of title, and the question is not open
whether or not these lots were out-lots or common-field lots, or other lots described
in the statute. The title is good until some person can show a better.
Such a better title was not found in an entry under the pre-emption lavs of April 12,
1814, and 29th of April, 1816. The land in question was within the limits of the
town of St. Louis, and was also reserved from sale. For both reasons it was not
subject to pre-emption.
The ignorance of the pre-emptioner that the land was reserved, does not prevent the
entry from being void.

TIs case was brought up from the supreme court of Missouri by a writ of error issued under the 25th section of the
judiciary act.

SUPREME

COURT.

Kissell v. St. Louis Public Schools.

It was an ejectment, brought by the board of school commissioners, to recover from Kissell the following lot in St. Louis
county, namely: Beginning on the west side of a street running
parallel with and next east of Carondelet Avenue, called Lawrence street or Short street, at a point 120 feet south of the
intersection of said street with Wood street; thence westwardly
in a line parallel with Wood street 120 feet to an alley; thence
southwardly along the said alley 90 feet; thence easterly in a
line parallel with Wood street 120 feet, and thence to the place
of beginning.
The suit was brought in the St. Louis circuit court, (state
court,) where there was a judgment for the plaintiffs. Kissell
carried it to the supreme court, where the judgment was affirmed,
and a writ of error brought the case up to this court.
The school commissioners claimed title under the three acts
of congress mentioned in the head note of the case, and the survey made in 1843, a copy of which was produced in court.
Kissell claimed under an entry of fractional section 26, made by
Robert Duncan, on the 2d of May, 1836, by virtue of a preemption right.
Without a copy of the map, it is difficult to convey to those
members of the profession who are not familiar with Missouri
land cases, a clear idea of the nature of this case. It may be
proper, however, to mention that it contained numerous long
and narrow parallelograms, which, it was contended, were the.
only lots referred to by the statutes as out-lots, &c., whilst the
pieces of land designated by the surveyor as school lands were
in detached pieces, scattered about in various places.
It was argued by .3fr. Lawrence and Mir. ohnson, for the
plaintiff in error, for whom there was also a printed argument
filed by Mr. Thomas C. Johnson, of St. Louis. For the defendants in error, it was argued by 31r. Geyer.
The points made on behalf the plaintiff in error, were:
1. That, by the terms of the act of 1812, lots reserved for school
purposes were such only as had a previous existence under the
Spanish government. 2. That it was to the limits of the Spanish, and not to the limits of the American town, that reference
is made in the proviso to the second section, limiting the lots reserved for the support of schools to one twentieth of the land
within such town or village; and, 3. That by the term "out
boundary," used in the first section, reference is not made to a
continuous out boundary or "ring survey," but to the out boundary respectively of the town, common-fields, and commons, separately.

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

21

Kissell v. St. Louis Public Schools.

The points made by _Mr. Geyer were the following, namely:
1. The act of congress of the 13th of June, 1812, making further provision for settling the claims to land in the Territory of
Missouri, and the acts supplementary thereto, of the 26th of May,
1824, and 27th of January, 1831, together with the certificate
of the surveyor-general of the survey, designation, and setting
apart of the land in controversy, for the support of schools, constitute a complete legal title, equivalent to a patent, conclusive
upon the United States, to which the mere entry of the same
land with the register and receiver must yield.
2. The survey of the out-boundaries of the town of St- Louis,
given in evidence, having been made and certified by the surveyor-general, in pursuance of authority vested in him by law,
neither its accuracy nor its validity was open to question in the
case at bar.
3. The certificate of the surveyor-general, of the survey, designating and setting apart the land in question, is evidence not
only that it is within the out-boundaries, but that it was, at the
time of designation, a vacant lot, reserved by the act of 1812,
bad not been selected for military purposes by the President, and
does not, together with the lands before assigned, exceed the
maximum liiit; and, unless it appeared that the United States
bad no title, or tie surveyor-general no authority to make the
survey and designation, it is conclusive, upon a principle applicable alike to all official acts of public officers in the disposition
of public lands.
4. The "Plat and description of the survey of the outboundaries of the town (now city) of St. Louis," made and
certified by the surveyor-general, if not absolutely conclusive, is
at least primd facie evidence that it is in conformity with the
requirements of the act of 1812, and, for the purpose of this
case, that is all-sufficient. No evidence is necessary to support
the survey, and there is none on the record competent to overthrow it.
5. If the survey and designation of the lot in question to the
use of schools shall be held to be subject to review in a collateral
action at law, still, it requires the production of no evidence in
aid of it. It stands for proof until it is rebutted; and, in this
case, there is no testimony produced by the defendant below,
competent to repel or impair its force.
Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
In this case, the school commissioners were plaintiffs in their
corporate capacity, and, in order to eject the defendant below,
were bound to produce a legal title to the land claimed. Their
title depends on three acts of congress, passed in 1812, 1824,

22

and 1831. The act of 1812 confirmed, to private owners at St.
Louis and other villages in Missouri, town lots, out-lots, and
common-field lots, in, adjoining, and belonging to the towns, and
it also confirmed to the towns their commons.
This act made it the duty of the principal surveyor to survey,
or cause to be surveyed and marked, (where the same had not
already been done according to law,) the out-boundary lines of
the said several towns and villages, so as to include the out-lots,
common-field lots, and commons thereto respectively belonging.
The second section provides, "that all town or village lots,
out-lots, or common-field lots, included in such surveys, which
are not rightfully owned or claimed by any private individuals,
or held as commons belonging to such towns or villages, or that
the President of the United States may not think proper to reserve for military purposes, shall be, and the same are thereby,
reserved for the support of schools in the respective towns and
villages: Provided, the whole quantity of land contained in the
lots reserved for the support of schools shall not exceed one
twentieth of the whole lands included in the general survey of
any town or village."
The first section of the act of the 26tl of May, 1824, requires
the owners of lots which are confirmed by the act of the 13th of
June, 1812, within eighteen months after the passage of the act,
"to designate their said lots by proving, before the recorder of
land titles, the fact of inhabitation, cultivation, or possession of
their said lots, and the boundaries and extent of each claim, so
as to enable the surveyor-general to distinguish the private from
the vacant lots appertaining to said towns and villages."
The second section of this act makes it the duty of the surveyor-general, immediately after the expiration of the time allowed for private owners to prove the inhabitation, cultivation,
and possession of their lots, "to proceed, under the instruction
of the commissioner of the general land-office, to survey, designate, and set apart to the said towns and villages, respectively,
so many of the said vacant town or village lots, out-lots, and
common-field lots, for the support of schools in said towns and
villages, respectively, as the President shall not, before that time,
have reserved for military purposes, and not exceeding one twentieth part of the whole lands included in the general survey of
such town or village, according to the provision of the second
section of the act of the 13th of June, 1812; and also to survey
and designate, as soon after the passage of this act as may be, the
commons belonging to the said towns and villages, according to
their respective claims and confirmations under said act of congress, where the same has not already been done."

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

Kissell v. St. Louis Public Schools.

By the third section of the act, the recorder of land titles is
required to issue a certificate of confirmation for each (private)
claim confirmed, "and, as soon as the said term (eighteen
months) shall have expired, furnish the surveyor-general with
the list of lots proved to have been inhabited, cultivated, or possessed, to serve as his guide in distinguishing them from the
vacant lots to be set apart as above described, (for the use of
schools,) and shall transmit a copy of such list to the commissioner of the general land-office."
On the 27th of January, 1881, an act of congress was passed,
for the purpose of transferring the title of the United States (if
any) remaining in the property belonging to the several towns
and villages embraced by the act of the 13th of June, 1812.
. The first section relinquishes to the inhabitants of the several
towns and villages all the right, title, and interest of the United
States in and to the town and village lots, out-lots, and commonfield lots confirmed to them by the first section of the act of the
13th of June, 1812. The second section relinquishes all right,
title, and interest of the United States in and to the town and
village lots, out-lots, and common-field lots reserved for the support of schools, by the act of 1812, in the respective towns and
villages, and provides that "the same shall be sold or disposed
of, or regulated, for the said purpose, in such manner as may be
directed by the legislature of the State of Missouri."
The defendants in error were incorporated by a public act of
the legislature of Missouri, approved the 13th of February,
1833, entitled "An act to establish a; corporation in the city of
St. Louis, for the purpose of public education." By the ninth
section of this act, the title, possession, charge, and control of all
lands and lots in or near St. Louis, granted to the inhabitants
for school purposes by any act of congress, is vested in the
board of school commissioners, with power to dispose of and
apply the same to the purpose of education.
At the trial, the (then) plaintiff gave in evidence the following documents, among others: 1. A plat called and known as map X, being certified by the
surveyor-general to be " a plat and description of the survey of
the out-boundary lines of the town (now city) of St. Louis, in
the Territory (now State) of Missouri, as it stood incorporated
on the 13th of June, 1812, including the out-lots, common-field
lots, and commons thereto belonging, made in pursuance of
the first section of the act of congress approved the 13th of
June, 1812, entitled I'An act making further provision for settling the claims to land in the Territory of Missouri,' which
was approved and certified by the surveyor-general, December 8,
1840."

2. A certificate of the surveyor-general, in pursuance of instructions of the commissioner of the general land-office, as
follows :"Assig-nent and Survey, LVo. 367.
"Office of the surveyor of public lands in the States of Illinois
and Missouri, St. Louis, June 15, 1843.
"Under the instructions of the commissioner of the general
land-office, the piece of land, the survey of which is herein
platted and described, has been legally surveyed, and under the
instructions aforesaid it is hereby designated and set apart to the
town (now city) of St. Louis, for the support of schools therein,
in conformity with the second section of the act of congress,

said piece of land hereby designated and set apart as aforesaid
is situated within the bounds of the survey directed to be made
by the first section of the act of the 13th of June, 1812, aforesaid, so as to include the town-lots, out-lots, common-field lots
and commons of the town of St. Louis; and is also within the
limits of the said town of St. Louis, as it stood incorporated on

other land designated and set apart to the town of St. Louis for

to be made of said town of St. Louis, by the aforesaid first
section of the act of congress of the 13th day of June, 1812;
the said piece of land was not, so far as the records of the office show, rightfully owned or claimed by any private individual

reserved by the President of the United States for military purposes."
Similar certificates are found in the record for other parcels
of lands assigned to the use of schools, but not involved in controversy.
When Louisiana was acquired, the lands included in the outboundary survey, comprising St. Louis, its fields and commons,
were held by imperfect rights, the legal title being vested in the
United States, as they had previously been in the government
of Spain. As this government could not be sued in its own
courts, nor coerced to perfect equitable claims and rights, claim-

ants had to rely on its justice; and as congress had the full and
sole power by the constitution to dispose of the public lands,
and to make needful rules and regulations for that purpose, it
followed that those who sought titles must obtain them on the
terms that congress might prescribe; and more especially were
the donations made by the act of 1812, to promote education,
regulated by this rule.
By the act of 1812, the towns acquired the promise of, and an
imperfect title to, certain vacant lands that might be found to
exist within an out-boundary survey, but the government reserved
to itself the power to make this survey, and the board of school
directors was therefore compelled to remain passive until it was
completed, and the private claims within it ascertained, and
until the United States designated the school lands comprehended within it.
This survey was completed in 1840 by the surveyor-general,
and in 1843 he fulfilled the duty of designating the school lands,
whereby they became vested in the authorities of Missouri.
These proceedings exhausted the powers of the surveyor-general
under the acts we have quoted; and whatever controversies
may now arise, in reference to these lands, must be subject to
judicial cognizance. See Elliott v. Piersol, 1 Pet. 341.
Our opinion is, that the school lands were in the condition
of Spanish claims after confirmation by the United States,
without having established and conclusive boundaries made by
public authority, and which claims depended for their specific
identity on surveys to be executed by the government. The
case of West v. Cochran, 17 How. 413, lays down the dividing
line between' the executive and judicial powers in such cases,
to wit: That until a designation, accompanied by a survey or
description, was made by the surveyor-general, the title attached
to no land, nor had a court of justice jurisdiction to ascertain
its boundaries.
We are furthermore of opinion that the certificate of the
surveyor-general, above set forth, and which was accepted by
the grantees, is record evidence of title, by the recitals in which
the government and the board of school directors are mutually
bound and concluded. And this instrument, declaring that
the land prescribed was reserved for the support of schools, and
the courts of justice having no power to revise the acts of the
surveyor-general under these statutes, as respects the school
lands, it is not open to them to inquire whether the lands set
apart were or were not lots of the description referred to in the
statutes. The parties interested have agreed that this land was
a school lot, and here the matter must rest, unless some third
person can show a better title. And the plaintiff in error insists

that he has shown a better one by the production of Duncan's
entry covering the land. It was allowed by the register and
receiver at St. Louis, May 2, 1836, for the fractional section No.
26, by virtue of a pre-emption claim set up by Duncan.
Of this land, the designated school lot claimed by the plaintiff below includes five acres and 1%ths of an acre.
The entry was contested, and was brought to the consideration of the commissioner of the general land-office, and upon
August 1, 1845, lie instructed the register and receiver that only
8-iy°u acres was vacant at that spot; the residue of the 35 14,& acres
surveyed as fractional section 26, had been located on private
claims; nor was there evidence that any part of the 8A acres
had been inhabited as required by the pre-emption laws. This
inquiry, he remarks, was however unnecessary, because the
acres had been reserved for the support of schools in the
town of St. Louis by the act of 1812, and a selection of said
land, for that purpose, having been made under the act, "it cannot, therefore, be subject to the operation of the subsequent
pre-emption laws of 1814 and 1816."
He further declared: "In addition to the above objection,
the said land is within the corporate limits of the city of St.
Louis, as established in 1809, and, if not so reserved, would not
have been subject to pre-emption subsequent to that time, - the
principle having been early settled in a pre-emption case for land
within the limits of the town of Mobile, that the right of preenption, designated for the benefit of agriculturists, could not
be regarded as applicable to residents within the bounds of an
incorporated city or town." For the foregoing reasons, the entry
of fractional section 26, for 35 14, acres, was cancelled, and the
register and receiver were ordered to refund the purchasemoney.
On these facts, the circuit court gave to the jury the following charge: "The court is asked to instruct you, that the claims of the
respective parties to the land in controversy must depend mainly
upon the question, whether the land was reserved for the use of
schools by the act of the 13th of June, 1812. In this view the
court concurs; but without advising you more at large upon
that subject, as requested, gives the case the direction indicated
by two of the propositions submitted, one on either side, designed
to effect a comparison between the titles of the parties. These
are as follows: "On the part of the defendant, ' that the pre-emption to Robert
Duncan conferred a valid claim under the pre-emption laws, and
that he, having settled upon the land before any survey thereof
was actually made, is entitled to hold it, and that the persons

deriving title from said Duncan have a title superior to the
plaintiffs.'
"On the other hand, it is insisted ' that the title of the plaintiffs, under the act of the surveyor-general, designating and
setting apart the ground in controversy to the plaintiffs, is superior to the title of the defendant, under an entry with tile
register and receiver of the land-office'; and of this opinion is
the court. The jury is therefore instructed, that, upon the titles
exhibited in testimony by the parties, the plaintiff is entitled to
recover.
"The court adds, that the defendant has the right to impeach
the title of the plaintiff, the same and to the same extent as if
the entry of Duncan, under which he claims, had not been
vacated by the commissioner of the general land-office. And
the court further instructs the jury, that no evidence has been
adduced on the part of the defendant competent to invalidate
or overthrow the plaintiff's title, and therefore the jury should
find for the plaintiff."
The conflicting titles both depend on acts of congress, and
are submitted to this court on the whole record; and which we
are called on to compare, as was done in the cases of Matthews
v. Zane, 4 Oranch, 382; Ross v. Barland, 1 Pet. 664; and Jackson v. Wilcox, 13 Pet. 509. This follows from the instruction
given, which maintains that the title of the board of public
schools, under the certificate of the surveyor-general, setting
apart the land in dispute to the plaintiffs below, was superior to
the defendants' title under Duncan's entry with the register and
receiver; and that, therefore, the jury was directed to find for
the plaintiff. This general instruction raises the question,
whether the land was subject to sale, to one claiming a preference 6f entry under the pre-emption laws.
To which it may be answered, that when the act of 1812
dedicated certain lands for the purposes of education to the use
of the village of St. Louis, and the act of 1831 vested the title
to these lands in the city, such lands were appropriated, and not
subject to sale; they were beyond the reach of the officers of the
government, nor could their action lawfully extend to them,
with the exception that they could be ascertained and designated
within the power reserved. Nor could Duncan be heard to say
that he did not know that this parcel of rand was reserved. The
same excuse might be made, and with a much greater claim to
justice and propriety, by one who obtained an entry on land
reserved from sale for military purposes, or for some other public
use, by the President; the fact of which reservation was hardly
known beyond the general and local land-offices; yet such entries have constantly been set aside as absolutely void, or as

28

voidable, by the department of public lands. The case of Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet., was an instance of the first kind, where
the entry was pronounced as absolutely void, it being in the
notorious limits of a reservation for military purposes; and so
here the entry of Duncan was within the notorious limits of the
city of St. Louis, according to the record of incorporation made
by the court of common pleas for St. Louis county, in 1809,
and which city limits are recognized by the department of public lands and by the out-boundary survey, as the existing limits
when the act of 1812 was passed. This appears from the documents offered in evidence, on which the instruction to the jury
was founded. We, therefore, concur with the views expressed
by the state courts and those of the commissioner of the general
land-office, that Duncan's entry was invalid.
As this concurrence with the state courts is conclusive of the
controversy, we do not deem it necessary to examine further into
the titles and instructions given to the jury.
It is proper to remark, that we are here dealing with the survey, (marked X,) and ascertaining its effect as regards the lands
granted and allotted for school purposes, and are not to be understood as having expressed any opinion on the effect of this
out-boundary survey on titles situated beyond it, and claimed
to have been confirmed by the act of 1812, or which were subject to be identified by the recorder of land titles, under the act
of 1824.
For the reasons above stated, it is ordered that the judgment
of the supreme court of Missouri be affirmed.
