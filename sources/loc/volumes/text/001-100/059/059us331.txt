divided sovereignties by which our country is governed. For
these reasons, though sensible of the bias, which, I suppose, every
one has in favor of this process, I have heretofore felt, and now
feel, constrained to examine with care the question of our juris-

diction to issue it; and being of opinion that this court has not
power to inquire into the validity of the cause of commitment
stated in this petition, I think it should be dismissed for that
reason.

In this opinion Mr. Justice CAMPBELL concurs.

GEORGE 0.

DODGE, APPELLANT, V. JOHN

M.

WOOLSEY.

A stockholder in a corporation has a remedy in chancery against the directors, to prevent them from doing acts which would amount to a violation of the charter, or to
prevent any misapplication of their capital or profits which might lessen the value
of the shares, if the acts intended to be done amount to what is called in law a breach
of trust or duty.
So also a stockholder has a remedy against individuals, in whatever character they
profess to act, if the subject of complaint is an imputed violation of a corporate franchise, or the denial of a right growing out of it, for which there is not an adequate
remedy at law.
Therefore, where the directors of a bank refused -to take the proper measures to resist
the collection of a tax, which they themselves believed to have been imposed upon
them in violation of their charter, this refusal amounted to what is termed in law a
breach of trust, a stockholder had a right to file a bill in chancery asking for such a
remedy as the case might require.
If the stockholder be a resident of another State than that in which the bank and persons attempting to violate its charter, or commit a breach of trust or duty have their
domicile, he may file his bill in the courts of the United States. He has this right
under the constitution and laws of the United States.
The rights and duties of this court examined and explained, as an ultimate tribunal to
determine whether laws enacted by congress, or by state legislatures or decisions of
state courts are in conflict with the constitution of the United States.
Where the State of Ohio, chartered a bank in 1845, in which charter was stipulated the
amount of tax which the bank should pay, in lien of all taxes to which said company or the stockholders thereof, on account of stock owned therein, would otherwise be subject; and in 1852, the legislature passed an act levying taxes upon the
bank to a greater amount and founded upon a different principle. This act is in
conflict with the constitution of the United States, as impairing the obligation of a
contract, and therefore void.
The fact, that the people of the State had, in 1851, adopted a new constitution, in
which it was declared that taxes should be imposed upon banks in the mode which
the act of 1852 purported to carry out, cannot release the State from the obligations
and duties imposed upon it by the constitution of the United States.
The case of the Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 16 How. 369, again
affirmed.

Tnis was an appeal from the circuit court of the United States
for the District of Ohio.

SUPREME

COURT.

Dodge v. Woolsey.

It was argued by Mr. Spalding and Mr1.rugh, for the appellant, and by H1r. Stanberry and _MTr. Vinton, for the appellee.
The points made by the counsel for the appellant, in this
court, were substantially the same with the reasons assigned by
Dodge, in the circuit court in support of a motion to dissolve the
injunction.
They were the following, namely: 1. The complainant cannot sustain a suit in equity against the
defendant, George C. Dodge; for in the event of his making distress for the tax in said bill mentioned, the complainant will have
"plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law."
2. The complainant, as one of the stockholders of said Commercial Branch Bank, has no right to call the directors of said
bank to account, in a court of equity, for an error of judgment
in respect to any matter confided to their discretion.
3. There is no allegation in the bill that the bank or its directors refuse, by collusion with this defendant, or with other persons, to prosecute a suit, or to take other measures to prevent
the collection of said tax.
4. The complainant, in the character of a stockholder, has no
right to call the bank to account in a court of equity for a breach
of trust, as the relation of trustee and cestui que trust does not
exist between the corporation and its several stockholders.
5. The said Commercial Branch Bank is the creature of the
laws of Ohio, and has no corporate existence in any other State.
In the law, such corporation is regarded in the light of a citizen
and inhabitant of the State which creates and sustains it. The
Commercial Branch Bank can have no right to institute a suit
in the federal court against George C. Dodge, also a citizen and
inhabitant of Ohio.
6. A stockholder of the Commercial Branch Bank is one of
the component parts of the corporation. He has no distinct
individuality, so far as it respects the interests of the bank, that
will enable him to sue a citizen of Ohio in the federal court,
although he may be a citizen and inhabitant of the State of
Connecticut.
7. The complainant, in his bill, does not show himself entitled
to the interposition of this honorable court, sitting as a court of
equity.
8. The tax law of April 13, 1852, is a valid, constitutional
enactment by the general assembly of the State of Ohio.
9. It is contrary to sound public policy, that the collection of
the State revenue should be arrested by the instrumentality of a
writ of injunction.
In support of the firs4 point it was alleged that the damages

which the complainant estimated that he would sustain by the
tax were not more than $ 500, whereas the answer of Dodge,
showed him to be worth $ 80,000. Baldwin, C. C. R. 394.
In the case of Osborn v. The United States Bank, the whole
franchise of the bank was in jeopardy, so far as it respected that
State, 9 Wheat. 738.
The right called in question was the right of the bank, an
artificial person, but having a legal existence within the State
of Ohio, of which State, Dodge, the other party was a citizen.
No suit could therefore be carried on between them in the circuit
court of the United States.
2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, and 6th, points. A stockholder had no right
to intervene for the protection of the bank. The persons specified in the charter, and they alone, are or can be the agents of
the corporation. 1 lXyd on Corporations, 13; Angell & Ames,
on Corporations, 259; 8 Sergeant & Rawle, 521; 6 Sergeant &
Rawle, 508.
It is definitively settled, however, by a great weight of authority, that where the charter has invested the board of directors
with power to manage the concerns of the corporation, no one
stockholder, nor any number of stockholders, has a right to
compel these, the charter agents of the body corporate, to do any
act contrary to their own judgment exercised in good faith.

This bill is a contrivance to give jurisdiction to the federal
courts, where none fairly exists, and must therefore be discountenanced. 4 Dallas, 3830; 1 Wash. C. C. R. 83; 5 Cranch, 87.
8. The tax law of 1852, is a valid, constitutional enactment.
When the case of the Piqua Branch Bank was decided, 16
How. 369, it was with reference to this circumstance, namely,
that the law imposing the additional tax was imposed by a
legislature which was ,.itting under the same constitution as that
But this case is different in
which granted the charter of 1845
this respect.
The constitution of 1802, contained in article 8, ยง 1, this clause.

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Wooisey.

"For the great purpose of protecting their rights and liberties,
and securing their independence, they (the people,) have at all
times a complete power to alter, reform, or abolish their government whenever they may deem it necessary."
And in the mode prescribed by another article they altered
their constitution in 1851, so far as to require that all property
employed in banking, whether by banks then existing or thereafter to be created, should always bear a burden of taxation,
equal to that imposed upon the property of individuals.
Therefore, the immunity granted to the banking companies
of Ohio, by the 60th section of the act of February 24, 1845,
was accepted by them with a tacit understanding that its efficacy might be impaired by the sovereignty of the State, upon the
reformation of the government, and the adoption of a new constitution.
In McCullough v. The State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. p. 404,
Mr. Chief Justice Marshall says: "It has been said that the
people had already surrendered all their powers to the state
sovereignties, and had nothing more to give. But, surely, the
question whether they may resume and modify the powers
granted to government does not remain to be settled in this
country."
In Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch, 43, Mr. Justice Story says:
"Upon a change of government, too, it may be admitted that
such exclusive privileges attached to a private corporation as are
inconsistent with the new government, may be abolished."
In Mumma v. Potomac Company, 8 Peters, 281, the same
learned justice remarks as follows: "A corporation, by the very terms and nature of its political
existence, is subject to dissolution by a surrender of its corporate
franchises, and by a forfeiture of them for wilful misuser and
non-user.
"Every creditor must be presumed to unddrstand the nature
and incidents of such a body politic, and to contract with reference to them. And it would be a doctrine new in the law, that
the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force
upon it a perpetuity of existence contrary to public policy, and
the nature and objects of its charter."
The counsel for the appellee contended that as the tax, for
1853, amounted to nine per cent upon the capital of the bank,
the case was brought within Osborn v. United States Bank,
9 Wheat. 738; that there was danger of irreparable mischief to
the franchise, and a necessity for protecting the moneys, and
choses in action of the bank from sale, and alienation under the
tax proceedings.
In the two cases cited on the other side, namely, 3 Ohio,

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

335

Dodge v. Woolsey.

370, and the Mechanics' and Traders' Bank v. Debolt, the
amount of tax would not have been destructive.
The next point is as to the right of the plaintiff to bring this
bill.
He sues in the character of a stockholder, and makes the bank
and the directors parties defendant. The case which he makes
is, that an act is threatened to be done by Dodge, the tax collector, in violation of law, which, if not prevented, will result in
irreparable mischief to the corporation, and to his interest as a
stockholder; and that the directors of the bank refuse to take
any step to prevent the threatened injury. It further appears,
that although the directors have protested against the doing of
the act as a violation of the charter of the bank, yet they did
suffer the distraint to be made for the tax of 1852, and took no
step to prevent the distraint for the tax of 1853, which was
impending when the bill was filed. It appears that there was
no time for delay; for the distraint was to be made on the 21st
of December, and the injunction was not applied for until the
day previous.
We claim that, under such circumstances, a stockholder has
a clearright to intervene. 11 Georgia, 569; 3 Paige, 233;
1 Freeman, 173; 4 Russ. 575; Hodges v. New England Screw
Co. 1 R. I. 312; 7 Ohio, Pt. 1, 218; 16 How. 288; Angell &
Ames, on Corp. ยง 312.
Upon the other branch of the case, the counsel contended that
the case of Piqua Branch Bank v. Knoop, 16 How. 369, decided
that the 60th section of the charter was a contract, and therefore
it was no longer an open question. The ground assumed by
the other side, namely, that the adoption of a new constitution
in 1851, gave validity to the act of 1852, cannot be sustained.
1. Because the constitution of every State must be made in
subordination to the constitution of the United States; and that
in this respect, the constitution of a State in no way differs from
any other law, and such constitution can no more direct the
legislature to pass a law impairing the obligation of a contract,
than it can direct or authorize the State to make treaties,
alliances, confederations, coin money, or to do any other of those
acts which are prohibited to the States by the same clause where
the one now in question is found.
2. Because the power to make treaties, alliances, confederations, coin money, pass cx post facto laws and laws impairing
the obligation of contracts, &c., was surrendered by the States,
and is no longer possessed by the people or by the legislatures
of the States, and they cannot resume or exercise the power
thus surrendered, by means of a State constitution, or in any
other way short of an amendment of the constitution of the
Viiited States.

336

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

3.Because if this can be done, it not only annuls section 10
of the 1st article, but also that clause of article 6 of the constitution of the United States which declares that said constitution
shall be the supreme law of the land; for if such State constitution be valid, it must put aside and override the constitution of
the United States.
4. Because, thereby the constitution of the United States
would virtually become in each State what the people of such
State might choose to make it, without the consent of the
States of the Union.
In the case of Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Pet. 257, the
court say, a State cannot do that which the federal constitution
declares it shall not do.
And it has even been held, that the stipulations of a treaty
between the United States and a foreign nation are paramount
to the provisions of the constitution of a particular State of the
confederacy. Gordon v. Kerr, 1 Wash. Circuit Ot. Rep. 322.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
It must often happen, under such a government as that of the
United States, that constitutional questions will be brought to
this court for decision, demanding extended investigation and
its most careful judgment.
This is one of that kind; but fortunately it involves no new
principles, nor any assertion of judicial action which has not been
repeatedly declared to be within the constitutional and legislative
jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, and by way of
appeal or by writ of error, as the case may be, within that of the
supreme court.
It is a suit in chancery, which was brought by John A.
Woolsey, in the circuit court of the United States for the district
of Ohio, seeking to enjoin the collection of a tax assessed by the
State of Ohio on the Commercial Branch Bank of Cleveland, a
branch of the State Bank of Ohio. He makes George C. Dodge,
the tax collector, the directors of the bank, and the bank itself,
defendants.
Woolsey avers that he is a citizen of the State of Connecticut,
that he is the owner of thirty shares in the Branch Bank of
Cleveland, that Dodge and the other defendants are all citizens
of the State of Ohio, and that the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, is a corporation, and was made such, as a branch of the
State Bank of Ohio, by an act of the general assembly of that
State, passed the 24th of February, 1845, entitled "An act to
incorporate the State Bank of Ohio and other banking companies." He alleges that the Commercial Bank has in all things
complied with the requirements of its charter, and that, by the

DECEM1BER TERM, 1855.

Dodge v. Woolsey.

60th section of the act, it is declared that each banking company
organized under it and complying with its provisions, shall,
semi-annually, on the 1st of May and 1st of November of each
year, those being the days for declaring dividends, set off to the
State of Ohio six per cent on the profits, deducting therefrom
the expenses and ascertained losses of the company, for six
months next preceding each dividend day; and that the sums
so set off shall be in lieu of all taxes to which said company, or
the stockholders thereof, on account of stock owned therein,
would otherwise be subject; and that the cashier of such company shall, within ten days thereafter, inform the auditor of the
State of Ohio of the amount set off, and shall pay the same to
the treasurer of the State oi the order of the auditor.
It is averred that the Bank of Cleveland had at all times complied with the requirements of the act. That, in the year 1853,
it set off to the State six per cent on the two semi-annual dividends which had been made in that year, on the first day of
May and the first day of November, which amounted in the

avers, that three years before bringing his suit, having full confidence that the State of Ohio would observe good faith towards
the bank, in respect to its franchises and privileges conferred
upon it by the act of incorporation, and that it would adhere
with fidelity to the rule of taxation provided for in the charter,
he had purchased thirty shares of the capital stock of the bank,
and that he was then the owner of the same. He further states,
after he had made such purchases, that on the 17th of June,
1851, a draft of a new constitution had been submitted to the
electors of the State for their acceptance or rejection, which, if
accepted by a majority of the electors who should vote, was to
take effect as the constitution of the State, on the 1st of September, 1851. It is admitted that it was accepted, that it became and now is the constitution of the State of Ohio. It is
provided in sections two and three of the 12th article of that
constitution, that laws shall be passed, taxing by an uniform
rule, all moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stock, joint-stock
companies, or otherwise; and that the general assembly shall
provide by law for taxing the notes and bills discounted or purchased, money loaned, and all other property, effects, or dues
whatever, without deduction, of all banks now existing, or hereafter created, and of all bankers, so that all property employed
in banking shall always bear a burden of taxation equal to that
imposed on the property of individuals. And in the 4th section
of the 13th article of the constitution of 1851, it is further deVOL. xViii.

29

clared, that the property of corporations now existing, or hereafter created, shall be subject to taxation, as the property of
individuals.
It appears also by the bill, that the general assembly of the
State of Ohio passed an act on the 13th of April, 1852, for the
assessment and taxation of all property in the State, and for
levying taxes on the same according to its true value in money,
in which it is declared to be the duty of the president and
cashier of every bank, or banking company, "that shall have
been, or may hereafter be, incorporated by the laws of the State,
and having the right to issue bills for circulation as money, to
make and return, under oath, to the auditor of the county in
which such banks may be, in the month of May, annually, a
written statement containing, first, the average amount of notes
and bills discounted or purchased, which amount shall include
all the loans or discounts, whether originally made, or renewed
during the year, or at any time previous: whether made on bills
of exchange, notes, bonds, mortgages, or other evidence of indebtedness, at their actual cost value in money; whether due
previous to, during, or after the period aforesaid, and on which
said banking company has, at any time, recovered or received,
or is entitled to receive, any profit or other consideration whatever, either in the shape of interest, discount, exchange, or otherwise; and secondly, the average amount of all other moneys,
effects, or dues of every description, belonging to such bank, or
banking company, loaned, invested, or otherwise used or employed, with a view to profit, or upon which such bank, or
banking company receives, or is entitled to receive, interest.
The act then makes it the duty of the auditors, in the counties
in which a bank or banking companies may be, to receive from
them returns of notes and bills discounted, and all other moneys
and effects or dues, as provided for in the 19th section of the
act, to enter the same for taxation upon the grand duplicate of
the property of the county, and upon the city duplicate for city
taxes, in cases where the city tax is not returned upon the grand
duplicate, but is collected by city officers; which amounts so
returned and entered shall be taxed for the same purposes and
to the same extent that personal property is, or may be taxed,
in the place where such bank or banking company is sitnated.
It is then averred that the president and cashier of the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, fearing the penalty imposed by the
act for a refusal or neglect to make a return according to the
act, did, in the month of May, in the year 1852, make a return,
protesting against the right of the State to assess a tax upon
the bank, other than that which was provided for in the charter
of its incorporation, of the 24th February, 1845. But it appears

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

389

Dodge v. Woolsey.

that the return so coerced from the president and directors of
the bank had been assessed by the auditor, for the tax of 1852,
at 8 10 197-%, exceeding by $ 7,526-1% the amount of tax for
which the tank was liable under its charter, which George C.
Dodge, as collector of taxes, seized and collected by distress on
its moneys. It is also shown by the bill, that there has been
another entry of taxation against the bank for the year 1853, of
8 14,771 lj 0 , exceeding the sum to which it is liable under its
charter by $11,665J & for that year.
It is against the collection of this tax that John Al. Woolsey,
as a stockholder in the bank, has brought this suit, claiming an
exemption from it as a stockholder, upon the ground that the
act of the general assembly of the State of Ohio, and the tax
assessed under it upon the bank, are in violation of the 10th
section of the 1st article of the constitution of the United States,
which declares that no State shall pass any law impairing the
obligation of contracts. And he seeks the aid of the circuit
court to enjoin Dodge, the defendant, from collecting the same
from the bank, as collector of taxes, as he had threatened to do
by distress, and as he had done for the assessed tax for the year
1852.
The complainant gives a further aspect to his suit which it is
also proper to notice. It is, if the taxes are permitted to be assessed and collected from the bank, under the act of the 13th of
April, 1852, it will virtually destroy and annul the contract
between the State and the bank, in respect to the tax which the
State imposed upon it by the charter of its incorporation, in lien
of all other taxes upon the bank or the stockholders thereof, on
account of stock owned therein; that his stock will be thereby
lessened in value, his dividends diminished; and that the tax is
so onerous upon the bank, that it will compel a suspension and
final cessation of its business. He finally declares that as a
stockholder, on his own behalf, he had requested the directors
of the bank to take measures, by suit or otherwise, to assert the
franchises of the bank against the collection of what he believes
to be an unconstitutional tax, and that they had refused to
do so.
To this bill the defendant, George C. Dodge, filed an answer.
The other defefidants did not answer. He admits the material
allegations of the bill, except the allegation that the tax law of
April 13, 1852, is unconstitutional; says that the act is in conformity with the constitution of Ohio, which took effect September 1, 1851, and that it is in harmony with the constitution
of the United States. He denies that any application was
made by Woolsey to the directors of the bank, to take measures,
by suit or otherwise, to prevent the collection of the tax, and

340

COURT.

Dodge v. Woolsey.

insists that this averment was inserted merely for the purpose of
giving color to a proceeding in chancery. That the complainant
would not have sustained an irreparable injury even if he had,
as treasurer, proceeded to distrain for the tax; for that the bank
would have had a remedy at law against him for all damages
which might have been sustained in consequence of such distress, as he is worth, at a reasonable estimate, eighty thousand
dollars after the payment of all his debts. And he insists that
the complainant had not exhibited such a case as entitled him
to the interposition of a court of equity. To this answer a
general replication was filed. But it was agreed by the counsel
in the cause, that the complainant had, by his attorney, addressed a letter to the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, to institute proper proceedings to prevent the collection of the tax by
Dodge, in the same manner as had been done by the attorney
of a stockholder in the Canal Bank of Cleveland, for a tax assessed upon it under the same act, and that the action of the
board of the Commercial Bank, in answer to Woolsey's application, was the same as had been given by the directors of the
Canal Bank. That resolution was in these words: "Resolved,
that we fully concur in the views expressed in said letter as to
the illegality of the tax therein named, and believe it to be in
no way binding upon the bank; but, in consideration of the
many obstacles in the way of testing the law in the courts of the
State, we cannot consent to take the action which we are called
upon to take, but must leave the said Kleman to pursue such
measures as he may deem best in the premises."
Upon the foregoing pleadings and admission, the circuit court
rendered a final decree for the complainant, perpetually enjoining
the treasurer against the collection of the tax, under the act of
the 18th February, 1852, and subjecting the defendant, Dodge,
to the payment of the costs of the suit. From that decision the
defendant, Dodge, has appealed to this court.
His counsel have relied upon the following points to sustain the
appeal:1. The complainant does not show himself to be entitled to
relief in a court of chancery, because the charter of the bank
provides, that its affairs shall be managed by a board of directors, and that they are not amenable to the stockholders for an
error of judgment merely. And that in order to make them so,
it should have been averred that they were in collusion with the
tax collector in their refusal to take legal steps to test the validity
of the tax.
2. It was urged that this suit had been improperly brought
in the circuit court of the United States for the district of Ohio,
because it is a contrivance to create a jurisdiction, where none

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

341

Dodge v. Woolsey.

fairly exists, by substituting an individual stockholder in place
of the Commercial Bank as complainant, and making the directors defendants; the stockholder being made complainant, because he is a citizen of the State of Connecticut, and the directors
being made defendants to give countenance to his suit.
3d. It was said, if the foregoing points were not available to
defeat the action, that it might be contended that the defendant
was in the discharge of his official duty when interrupted by the
mandate of the circuit court, and that the tax had been properly
assessed by a law of the State, in conformity with its constitution,
of the 1st September, 1851.
We will consider the points in their order. The first comprehends two propositions, namely: that courts of equity have no
jurisdiction over corporations, as such, at the suit of a stockholder for violations of charters, and none for the errors of judgment of those who manage their business ordinarily.
There has been a conflict of judicial authority in both. Still,
it has been found necessary, for prevention of injuries for which
common-law courts were inadequate, to entertain in equity such
a jurisdiction in the progressive development of the powers and
effects of private corporations upon all the business and interests
of society.
It is now no longer doubted, either in England or the United
States, that courts of equity, in both, have a jurisdiction over
corporations, at the instance of one or more of their members ;
to apply preventive remedies by injunction, to restrain those who
administer them from doing acts which would amount to a
violation of charters, or to prevent any misapplication of their
capitals or profits, which might result in lessening the dividends
of stockholders, or the value of their shares, as either may be
protected by the franchises of a corporation, if the acts intended
to be done create what is in the law denominated a breach of
trust. And the jurisdiction extends to inquire into, and to enjoin, as the case may require that to be done, any proceedings
by individuals, in whatever character they may profess to act, if
the subject of complaint is an imputed violation of a corporate
franchise, or the denial of a right growing out of it, for which
there is not an adequate remedy at law. 2 Russ. & Mylne Ch.

equity will interfere, and that there were cases in which a bill in
equity will lie against a corporation by one of its members. "It
is a breach of trust towards a shareholder in a joint-stock incorporated company, established for certain definite purposes prescribed by its charter, if the funds or credit of the company
are, without his consent, diverted from such purpose, though
the misapplication be sanctioned by the votes of a majority; and,
therefore, he may file a bill in equity against the company in his
own behalf, to restrain the company by injunction from any such
diversion or misapplication. In the case of Ware v. Grand Junction Water Company, 2 Russell & Mylne, a bill filed by a mem
ber of the company against it, Lord Brougham said: "It is said
this is an attempt on the part of the company to do acts which
they are not empowered to do by the acts of parliament," meaning the charter of the company; 1 so far I restrain them by injunction." "Indeed, an investment in the stock of a corporation
must, by every one, be considered a wild speculation, if it exposed the owners of the stock to all sorts of risk in support of
plausible projects not set forth and authorized by the act of
incorporation, and which may possibly lead to extraordinary
losses. The same jurisdiction was invoked and applied in the
case of Bagshaw v. The Eastern Counties Railway Company;
so, also, in Coleman v. The same company, 10 Beavan's Ch.
Reports, 1. It appeared in that case that the directors of the
company, for the purpose of increasing their traffic, proposed to
guarantee certain profits, and to secure the capital of an intended
steam-packet company, which was to act in connection with the
railway. It was held, such a transaction was not within the
scope of their powers, and they were restrained by injunction.
And in the second place, that in such a case one of the shareholders in the railway company was entitled to sue in behalf of
himself and all the other shareholders, except the directors, who
were defendants, although some of the shareholders had taken
shares in the steam-packet company. It was contended in this
case that the corporation might pledge, without limit, the funds
of the company for the encouragement of other transactions,
however various and extensive, provided the object of that liability was to increase the traffic upon the railway, and thereby
increase the traffic to the shareholders. But the master of the
rolls, Lord Langdale, said, "there was no authority for anything
of that kind."
But further, it is not only illegal for a corporation to apply its
capital to objects not contemplated by its charter, but also to
apply its profits. And therefore a shareholder may maintain a
bill in equity against the directors and compel the company to
refund any of the profits thus improperly applied. It is an im-

proper application for a railway company to invest the profits of
the company in the purchase of shares in another company.
The dividend (says Lord Langdale, in Solamons v. Laing, 14
Jurist for December, 1850) which belongs to the shareholders,
and is divisible among them, may be applied severally as their
own property; but the company itself or the directors, or any
number of shareholders, at a meeting or otherwise, have io right
to dispose of his shares of the general dividends, which belong
to the particular shareholder, in any manner contrary to the will,
or without the consent or authority of, that particular shareholder.
We do not mean to say that the jurisdiction in equity over
corporations at the suit of a shareholder has not been contested.
The cases cited in this argument show it to have been otherwise; but when the case of Hodges v. The New England Screw
Company et al. was cited against it,- (we may say the best
argued and judicially considered case which we know upon the
point, both upon the original hearing and rehearing of that
cause,)- the counsel could not have been aware of the fact that,
upon the rehearing of it, the learned court, which had decided
that courts of equity have no jurisdiction over corporations as
such at the suit of a stockholder for violations of charter, reviewed and recalled that conclusion.
The language of the
court is: "We have thought it our duty to review in this general
form this new and unsettled jurisdiction, and to say, in view of
the novelty and importance of the subject, and the additional
light which has been thrown upon it since the trial, we consider
the jurisdiction of this court over corporations for breaches of
charter, at the suit of shareholders, and how far it shall be extended, and subject to what limits, is still an open question in
this court. 1 Rhode Island Reports, 312-rehearing of the case
September term, 1853."
The result of the cases is well stated in Angell & Ames, paragraphs 391, 393. "In cases where the legal remedy against a
corporation is inadequate, a court of equity will interfere, is well
settled, and there are cases in which a bill in equity will lie
against a corporation by one of its members." "Though the result of the authorities clearly is, that in a corporation, when acting within the scope of and in obedience to the provisions of
its constitution, the will of the majority, duly expressed at a
legally constituted meeting, must govern; yet beyond the limits
of the act of incorporation, the will of the majority cannot make
an act valid; and the powers of a court of equity may be put in
motion at the instance of a single shareholder, if he can show
that the corporation are employing their statutory powers for
the accomplishment of purposes not within the scope of their
institution. Yet it is to be observed, that there is an important

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

distinction between this class of cases and those in which there
is no breach of trust, but only error and misapprehension, or
simple negligence on the part of the directors." *
We have then the rule and its limitation. It is contended
that this case is within the limitation ; or that the directors of
the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, in their action in respect to
the tax assessed upon it, under the act of April 18, 1852, and in
their refusal to take proper measures for testing its validity, have
committed an "error of judgment merely."
It is obvious, from the rule, that the circumstances of each case
must determine the jurisdiction of a court of equity to give the
relief sought. That the pleadings must be relied upon to collect
what they are, to ascertain in what character, and to what end a
shareholder invokes the interposition of a court of equity, on account of the mismanagement of a board of directors. Whether
such acts are out of or beyond the limits of the act of incorporation, either of commission contrary thereto, or of negligence in
not doing what it may be their chartered duty to do.
This brings us to the inquiry, as to what the directors have
done in this case, and what they refused to do upon the application of their co-corporator, John M. Woolsey. After a full statement of his case, comprehending all of his rights and theirs also,
alleging in his bill that his object was to test the validity of a
tax upon the ground that it was unconstitutional, because it impaired the obligation of a contract made by the State of Ohio

So it has been repeatedly decided, that a private corporation may be sued at law
by one of its own members. The text upon this subject is so well expressed, with
authorities to support it, that we will extract the paragraph 390 from Angell & Ames
entire. A private corporation may be sued by one of its own members. This point

with the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, and the stockholders
thereof; he represents in his own behalf, as a stockholder, that
lie had applied to the directors, requesting them to take measures, by suit or otherwise, to prevent the collection of the tax by
the treasurer, and that they refused to do so, accompanying,
however, their refusal with the declaration that they fully concurred with Woolsey in his views as to the illegality of the tax;
that they believed it in no way binding upon the bank, but that,
in consideration of the many obstacles in the way of resisting
the collection of the tax in the courts of the State, they could
not consent to take legal measures for testing it. Besides this
refusal, the papers in the case disclose the fact that the directors
had previously made two protests against the constitutionality
of the tax, because it was repugnant to the constitution of the
United States, and to that of Ohio also, both concluding with a
resolution that they would not, as then advised, pay the tax,
unless compelled by law to do so, and that they were determined
to rely upon the constitutional and legal rights of the bank
under its charter. Now, in our view, the refusal upon the part
of the directors, by their own showing, partakes more of disregard of duty, than of an error of judgment. It was a non-performance of a confessed official obligation, amounting to what
the law considers a breach of trust, though it may not involve
intentional moral delinquency. It was a mistake, it is true, of
what their duty required from them, according to their own
sense of it, but, being a duty by their own confession, their refusal was an act outside of the obligation which the charter imposed upon them to protect what they conscientiously believed
to be the franchises of the bank. A sense of duty and conduct
contrary to it, is not "an error of judgment merely," and cannot
be so called in any case. It amounted to an illegal application
of the profits due to the stockholders of the bank, into which a
court of equity will inquire to prevent its being made.
Thinking, as we do, that the action of the board of directors
was not "an error of judgment merely," but a breach of duty, it
is our opinion that they were properly made parties to the bill,
and that the jurisdiction of a court of equity reaches such a case
to give such a remedy as its circumstances may require. This
conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to notice further the point
made by the counsel that the suit should have been brought in
the name of the corporation, in support of which they cited the
case of the Bank of the United States v. Osborn. The obvious
difference between this case and that is, that the Bank of the
United States brought a bill in the circuit court of the United
States for the district of Ohio, to resist a tax assessed under an
act of that State, and executed by its auditor, and here the

346

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

directors of the Commercial Bank of Cleveland, by refusing to
do what they had declared it to be their duty to do, have forced
one of its corporators, in self-defence, to sue. If the directors
had done so in a state court of Ohio, and put their case upon
the unconstitutionality of the tax act, because it impaired the
obligation of a contract, and had the decision been against such
*claim, the judgment of the state court could have been re-examined, in that particular, in the supreme court of the United
States, under the same authority or jurisdiction by which it reversed the judgment of the supreme court of Ohio, in the case
of the Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Jacob Knoop,
treasurer of Miaipi county, 16 How. 369.
But it was said in the argument, that this suit had been improperly brought in the circuit court of the United States, because it was a contrivance by Woolsey, or between him and the
directors of the bank, to give that court jurisdiction, on account
of their residence and citizenship being in different States.
That the subject-matter of the suit was within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state courts, and that, if the jurisdiction in
the courts of the United States was sustained, it would make
inoperative to a great extent the 7th amendment of the constitution of the United States and the 16th section of the Judiciary
Act of 1789, this last being a declaratory act, settling the law,
as to cases of equity jurisdiction, in the nature of a proviso, limitation, or exception to its exercise. And further, that it would
make the judiciary of the United States paramount to that of
the individual States, and the legislative and executive departments of the federal government paramount to the same departments of the individual States.
We first remark as to the imputation of contrivance, that it is
the. assertion of a fact which does not appear in the case, one
which the defendants should have proved if they meant to rely
upon it to abate or defeat the complainant's suit, and that, not
having done so, as they might have attempted to do, we cannot
presume its existence. Mr. Woolsey's right, as a citizen of the
State of Connecticut, to sue citizens of the State of Ohio in the
courts of the United States, for that State, cannot be questioned.
The papers in the case also show, that the directors and himself
occupy antagonist grounds in respect to the controversy which
their refusal to sue forced him to take in defence of his rights as
a shareholdek in the bank. Nor can the counsel for the defendant assume the existence of such a fact in the argument of their
case in this court, in the absence of any attempt on their part to
prove it in the circuit court.
We remark, as to the subject-matter of the suit being within
the exclusive jurisdiction of the State courts, that the courts of

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

347

Dodge v. Woolsey.

the United States and the courts of the States have concurrent
jurisdiction in all cases between citizens of different States,
whatever may be the matter in controversy, if it be one for
judicial cognizance. Such is the constitution of the United
States, and the legislation to congress "in pursuance thereof."
And when it was urged that the jurisdiction of the case belonged exclusively to the state courts of Ohio, under the 7th
article of the amendments to the constitution, and the 16th section of the judiciary act of 1789 was invoked to sustain the
position, it seems it was forgotten that this court and other
courts of the United States had repeatedly decided that the
equity jurisdiction of the courts of the United States is independent of the local law of any State, and is the same in nature and
extent as the equity jurisdiction of England, from which it is derived, and that it is no objection to this jurisdiction, that there is
a remedy under the local law. Gordon v. Hobart, 2 Sumner,
C. C. Rep. 401.
It was also said by both of the counsel for the defendant, and
argued with some zeal, that if the court sustained the jurisdiction in this case, it would be difficult to determine whether anything, and how much of state sovereignty may hereafter exist.
We shall give to this observation our particular consideration, regretting that it should be necessary, but not doubting that such a
jurisdiction exists at the suit of a shareholder, and that the appellate jurisdiction of this court may be exercised in the matter,
not only without taking away any of the rights of the States, but,
by doing so, giving additional securities for their preservation, to
the great benefit of the people of the United States. If it does
not exist and was not exercised, we should indeed have a very
imperfect national government, altogether unworthy of the wisdom and foresight of those who framed it; incompetent, too, to
secure for the future those advantages hitherto secured by it to
the people of the United States, and which were in their contemplation, when, by their conventions in the several States, the constitution was ratified.
Impelled then by a sense of duty to the constitution, and the
administration of so much of it as has been assigned to the judiciary, we proceed with the discussion.
The departments of the government are legislative, executive,
and judicial. They are co-ordinate in degree to the extent of the
powers delegated to each of them. Each, in the exercise of its
powers, is indepeildent of the other, but all, rightfully done by
either, is binding upon the others. The constitution is supreme
over all of them, because the people who ratified it have made
it so; consequently, anything which may be done unauthorized
by it is unlawful. But it is not only over the departments of

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

the government that the constitution is supreme. It is so, to
the extent of its delegated powers, over all who made themselves
parties to it; States as well as persons, within those concessions
of sovereign powers yielded by the people of the States, when
they accepted the constitution in their conventions. Nor does
its supremacy end there. It is supreme over the people of the
United States, aggregately and in their separate sovereignties,
because they have excluded themselves from any direct or immediate agency in making amendments to it, and have directed
that amendments should be made representatively for them, by
the congress of the United States, when two thirds of both houses
shall propose them; or where the legislatures of two thirds of the
several States shall call a convention for proposing amendments,
which, in either case, become valid, to all intents and purposes,
as a part of the constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of
three fourths of the several States, or by conventions in three
,fourths of them, as one or the other mode of ratification may be
proposed by congress. The same article declares that no amendment, which might be made prior to the year 1808, should, in
any manner, affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article, and that no State, without its consent, shall
be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate. The first being a
temporary disability to amend, and the other two permanent and
unalterable exceptions to the power of amendment.
Now, whether such a supremacy of the constitution, with its
limitations in the particulars just mentioned, and with the
further restriction laid by the people upon themselves, and for
themselves, as to the modes of amendment, be right or wrong
politically, no one can deny that the constitution is supreme, as
has been stated, and that the statement is in exact conformity
with it.
Further, the constitution is not only supreme in the sense we
have said it was, for the people in the ratification of it have
chosen to add that "this constitution and the laws of the United
States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the
United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the
constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." And, in that connection, to make its supremacy more
complete, impressive, and practical, that there should be no
escape from its operation, and that its binding force upon the
States and the members of congress should be unmistakable, it
is declared that "the senators and representatives, before mentioned, and the members of the state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both of the United States and of

DECEMBER

TERM, 1855.

349

Dodge v. Woolsey.

the several States, shall be bound by an oath or affirmation to
support this constitution.
Having stated, not by way of argument or inference, but in
the words of the constitution, the particulars in which it is declared to be supreme, we proceed to show that it contains an
interpreter, or has given directions for determining what is its
meanitg and operation, what " laws are made in pursuance
thereof," and to fix the meaning of treaties which had been
made, or which shall be made, under the aut'hority of the United
States, when either the constitution, the laws of congress, or a
treaty, are brought judicially in question, in which a State, or
a citizen of the United States, or a foreigner, shall claim rights
before the courts of the United States, or in the courts of the
States, either under the constitution or the laws of the United
States, or from a treaty.
All legislative powers in the constitution are vested in a congress of the United States, which shall consist of a senate and
house of representatives. Then stating of whom the house shall
be composed, how they shall be chosen by the people of the several States, the qualification of electors, the age of representatives, the time of their citizenship, and their inhabitancy in the
State in which they shall be chosen ; how representatives and
direct taxes shall be apportioned, how the senate shall be composed, with sundry other provisions relating to the house and the
senate, the powers of congress are enumerated affirmatively.
The 9th section then declares what the congress shall not have
power to do, and it is followed by the 10th, consisting of tllree
paragraphs, all of them prohibitions upoli the States from doing
the particulars expressed in them.
Oar first suggestion now is, as all the legislative powers are
concessions of sovereignty from the people of the States, and the
prohibitions upon them in the 10th section are likewise so, both
raise an obligation upon the States not to legislate upon either;
each, however, conferring rights, according to what may be the
constitutional legislation of congress upon the first ; and the
second giving rights of equal force, without legislation in respect to such of them as execute themselves, on account of their
being prohibitions of what the States shall not do. For instance,
no legislation by congress is wanted to make more binding upon
the States what they have bound themselves in absolute terms
not to do. As where it is said "ho State shall enter into any
treaty, alliance, or confederation, grant letters of marque and reprisal, coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold
and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility."
VOL. xVIII.

350

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

Our next suggestion is, that the grants of legislative powers,
and the negation of the exercise of other powers by the States,
some of them being declarations that they would not legislate
upon those matters which had been exclusively given up for the
legislation of congress, do not imply that the States would be
wilfully disregardful of the obligations solemnly placed upon
them by their people; but that there might be interfeences
from their legislation in some of those particulars, either with
the constitution, or between their enactments and those of congress. But this apprehension (not without cause) was founded
upon the legislation of some of the States during the continuance
of the articles of confederation, affecting the rights and interests
of perisons in their contracts, from which they could get no relief,
unless it was granted by the same State legislatures which passed
the acts. This suggested the necessity, or rather made it obvious, that our national union would be incomplete and altogether
insufficient for the great ends contemplated, unless a constitutional arbiter was provided to give certainty and uniformity, in
all of the States, to the interpretation of the constitution and the
legislation of congress; with powers also to declare judicially
what acts of the legislatures of the States might be in conflict
with either. Had this not been done, there would have been no
mutuality of constitutional obligation between the States, either
in respect to the constitution or the laws of congress, and each
of them would have determined for itself the operation of both,
either by legislation or judicial action. In either way, exempting itself and its citizens from engagements which it had not
made by itself, but in common with other States of the Union,
equally sovereign ; by which they bound their sovereignties
to each other, that neither of them should assume to settle a
principle or interest for itself, in a matter which was the common
interest of all of them. Such is certainly the common-sense
view of the people, when any number of them enter into a
contract for their mutual benefit, in the same proportions of
interest. In such a case, neither should assume the right to
bind his compeers by his judgment, as to the stipulations of
their contract. If one of them did so, any other of them might
call in the aid of the law to settle their differences, and its judgment would terminate the controversy. It must not be said that
the illustration is inappropriate, because individuals have no other
mode to settle their disputes, and that States and nations, from
their equal sovereignty, have no tribunal to terminate authoritatively their differences, each having the right to judge and do so
for itself.
But ours is not such a government. The States, or rather the
people forming it, though sovereign as to the powers not delegated

to the United. States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to
the States, are not independent of each other, in respect to the
powers ceded in the constitution.
Their union, by the constitution, was made by each of them
conceding portions of their equal sovereignties for all of them,
and it acts upon the States conjunctively and separately, and in
the same manner upon their citizens, aggregately in some things,
and in others individually, in many of their relations of business,
and also upon their civil conduct, so far as their obedience to the
laws of congress is concerned.
In such a union, the States are bound by all of those principles
of justice which bind individuals to their contracts. They are
bound by their mutual acquiescence in the powers of the constitution, that neither of them should be the judge, or should be
allowed to be the final judge of the powers of the constitution, or
of the interpretation of the laws of congress. This is not so, because their sovereignty is impaired; but the exercise of it is diminished in quantity, because they have, in certain respects, put
restraints upon that exercise, in virtue of voluntary engagements.
(Vattel, Ch. 1, section 10.)
We will now give two illustrations-one from the constitution,
and the other from one of the cases decided in this court, upon a
tax act of the State of Ohio - to show that the framers of the
constitution, and the conventions which ratified it, were fully
aware of the necessity for and meant to make a department of it,
to which was to be confided the final decision judicially of the
powers of that instrument, the conformity of laws with it, which
either congress or the legislatures of the States may enact, and to
review the judgments of the state courts, in which a right is decided against, which has been claimed in virtue of the constitution or the laws of congress.
The third clause of the 2d section of the 1st article of the constitution is, "that representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States, according to their respective
numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole
number of free persons, including those bound to service for a
term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all
other persons." We will suppose that congress shall again impose a direct tax, and that a citizen liable to assessment should
dispute its application to a kind of his property, alleging it not
to be a direct tax, in the sense of that provision of the cdnstitution; and that he should apply to a state court for relief from an
execution which had been levied upon his property for its collection, making the United States collector of the tax a party to his
suit; and that the court should enjoin him from further proceedings to collect the tax. It is plain, if such a judgment was final,

352

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

and could not be reviewed by any other court, or by the supreme
court of the United States, in virtue of its appellate jurisdiction,
as that has been given by the act of congress, the result would
be, that the citizens of the State in which the judgment was
given, would be exempted from the payment of a tax which had
been intended by congress to be apportioned upon the property
of all of the citizens of the United States, in conformity with the
constitution. This would practically defeat the rule of apportionment if it was acquiesced in by the government of the United
States, and the constitutional collection of the tax could not be
made in any State according to the act. We do not mean that
the officers of the United States could not collect the tax in those
States in which no such judgment had been given; but if the
judgment could not be reviewed, that the constitutional rule for
the imposition of direct taxes could not be executed by any
legislation of congress which a State legislature or a state court
might not say was unconstitutional. We should not then have
a more perfect union than we had under the articles of confederation. Each State then paid the requisition of congress, when
it pleased to do so. Had it been continued, the union would be
more feeble for all national purposes than it had been. Then
the States only disregarded their obligations to suit their convenience. Had it not been corrected, as it has been done in the
constitution, we have no reason to believe that there would not
be like results, or that the courts of the States would not be resorted to, to determine the constitutionality of taxes laid by congress. This was certainly not meant by the framers of the constitution, nor can its disallowance be brought under the 10th
article of its amendments, which declares "that the powers not
delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
the people."
The illustration given, and its results, have been drawn from
the constitution of the United States, also from what might be
the action of the state legislatures and state courts, which could
not be prevented unless the supreme court of the United States
had the power to review the action of the state courts upon a
matter exclusively of national interest, made so by the legislation
of congress.
Hitherto, no such case as we have supposed has happened, but
a reference to the case of Hylton v. The United States, 3 Dallas,
171, in which an attempt was made to test the constitutionality
of a tax assessed by the United States, will show that a case of
the kind is not unlikely to occur, when congress shall impose a
tax apportioning representation and direct taxation; or, under
the general declaration in the 8th section of the 1st article of the

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

353

Dodge v. Woolsey.

constitution, that "congress shall have power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, but that all duties shall be
uniform throughout the United States." Let it be understood,
too, that the power is not only to impose duties and taxes, but
to collect them, and from the power to collect must necessarily
be inferred the disability of the legislatures of the States, or of
the courts of the States, in any way to interfere with its execution, as that may be directed by congress.. If the courts of the
States, or their legislatures, could finally determine against the
constitutionality of a tax laid by congress, there would be no
certainty or uniformity of taxation upon the citizens of the
United States, or of the apportionment of representation and
direct taxation according to the constitution.
Other illustrations of the propriety and necessity for a judicial
tribunal of the United States to settle such questions finally,
might be made from other clauses of the constitution. We
will, however, cite but one of them in addition to such as have
been already mentioned. It is the power of congress to regulate
commerce, and we refer to the case of Brown v. The State of
Maryland, as an instance of the attempt of that State to lay a
tax upon imports, which this court pronounced to be unconstitutional.
We will now give other illustrations, in which the rights of
property are involved, to show the cautious wisdom of that provision of the constitution which secures to the citizens of the
different States a right to sue in the courts of the United States,
and to claim either in them, or in the courts of the States, the
protection either of the constitution or of the laws of congress.
The legislature of Ohio passed an act in 1803, incorporating
the proprietors of the half-million of acres of land south of Lake
Erie called the " Sufferers' Land." This act required the appointment of directors, who were authorized to extinguish the
Indian title, to survey the land into townships, or otherwise make
partition among the owners; and, among other things provided,
"that, to defray all necessary expenses of the company in purchasing and extinguishing the Indian claim of title to the laud,

whatever it shall appear to them to be necessary and proper to
be done for the well-ordering and interest of the proprietors, not
contrary to the laws of the State. Subsequently, the legislature
of Ohio imposed a tax upon these lands as a part of the revenue
to be raised for the State. The directors assessed a tax upon

the share of each proprietor, to pay the tax to the State. A sale
of a part of the land was made for that purpose, and the question
subsequently raised in the circuit court of the United States for
the district of Ohio, in a suit at the instance of the heirs of one
of the proprietors whose land had been sold, was, whether the
sale conveyed a title to the land to the purchaser. It was determined by this court, that it did not, because the directors had
not power to make an assessment upon the lands to pay the state
tax, and that the tax, as laid by the State, had been done in violation of the corporate powers given to the directors. In this
case the plaintiffs sought protection against the tax laid by Ohio,
and acquiesced in by the directors of the corporation, because
that tax was contrary to the contract which the State had made
with the corporation for the benefit of the proprietors of the land.
The State, without being a party to the record, was interested in
the question. It was a suit between citizens of different States,
brought by the plaintiffs in the United States circuit court for
Ohio; and the motive for seeking that tribunal was, that his
rights might be tried in one not subject either to State or local
influences. It placed both parties upon an equality, in fact and
in appearances; and whatever might have been the result, neither
could complain of the disinterestedness of the court which adjudged their rights. Beatty v. The Lessee of Knowles, 4 Peters,
152.
The foundation of the right of citizens of different States to
sue each other in the courts of the United States, is not an unworthy jealousy of the impartiality of the state tribunals. It has
a higher aim and purpose. It is o make the people think and
feel, though residing in different States of the Union, that their
relations to each other were protected by the strictest justice, administered in courts indepeiident of all local control or connection
with the subject-matter of the controversy between the parties to
a suit.
lien unite in civil society, expecting to enjoy peaceably what
belongs to them, and that they may regain it by the law when
wrongfully withheld. That can only be accomplished by good
laws, with suitable provisions for the establishment of courts of
justice, and for the enforcement of their decisions. The right to
establish them flows from the same source which determines the
extent of the legislative and executive powers of government.
Experience has shown that the object cannot be attained without
a supreme tribunal, as one-of the departments of the government,
with defined powers in its organic structure, and the mode for
exercising them to be provided legislatively. This has been
done in the constitution of the United States. Its framers were
well aware of their responsibilities to secure justice to the people;

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

and well knew, as the object of all trials in courts was to determine the suits between citizens, that it could not be done satisfactorily to them, unless they had the privilege to appeal from
the first tribunal which had jurisdiction of a suit to another
which should have authority to pronounce definitively upon its
merits. (Vattel, 9thl chapter, on justice and polity.) Without
such a court the citizens of each State could not have enjoyed
all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States,
as they were intended to be secured by the second section of the
4th article of the constitution. Nor would the judicial power
have been extended in fact to "all cases in law and equity arising under the constitution, the laws of the United States, and
treaties made or which shall be made under their authority, to
all cases affecting ambassadors and other public ministers and
consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to
controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to
controversies between two or more States ; to those between
citizens of different States, or between citizens of the same State,
claiming lands under grants of different States; and between a
State and the citizens thereof and foreign States, citizens or
subjects." Article 3d, section 1st.
Without the supreme court, as it has been constitutionally and
legislatively constituted, neither the constitution nor the laws of
congress passed in pursuance of it, nor treaties, would be in
practice or in fact the supreme law of the land, and the injunction that the judges in every State should be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary
notwithstanding, would be useless, if the judges of state courts,
in any one of the States, could finally determine what was the
meaning and operation of the constitution and laws of congress,
or the extent of the obligation of treaties.
But let it be remembered, that the appellate jurisdiction of the
supreme court, as it is, is one of perfect equality between the
States and the United States. It acts upon the constitution and
laws of both, in the same way, to the same extent, for the same
purposes, and with the same final result. Neither the dignity
nor the independence of either are lessened by its organization
or action.
The same electors choose the members of the house of representatives who choose the members of the most popular branch
of the state legislatures. The senators of the United States are
chosen by the legislatures of the States. The senate and house
of representatives of the United States exercise their legislative powers independently of each other, their concurrence being
necessary to pass laws. The States are represented in the one,
the people in the other and in both. But as it was thought that

856

COURT.

they and the state legislatures might pass laws conflicting with the
letter or the spirit of the constitution under which they legislated,
it became necessary to make a judicial department for the United
States, with a jurisdiction best suited to preserve harmony
between the States, severally and collectively, with the national
government, and which would give the people of all of the
States that confidence and security under it anticipated by them
when they announced "that we, the people of the United
States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice
and domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, and
promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty
to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain this constitution for
the United States." Without a judicial department, just such
as it is, neither the powers of the constitution nor the purposes
for which they were given could have been attained.
We do not know a case more appropriate to show the necessity for such a jurisdiction than that before us.
citizen of the United States, residing in Connecticut, having
a large pecuniary interest in a bank in Ohio, with a board of
directors opposed, in fact, to the only course which could be
taken to test the constitutional validity of a law of that State
bearing upon the franchises of their corporation, is told by the
directors, that though they fully concur with him in believing
the tax law of Ohio unconstitutional and in no way binding
upon the bank, they will not institute legal proceedings to prevent the collection of the tax, "in consideration of the many
obstacles in the way of resisting the tax in the state courts."
Without partaking, ourselves, in their uncertainty of relief in the
courts of Ohio, it must be admitted their declaration was calculated to diminish this suitor's confidence in such a result, and to
induce him to resort to the only other tribunal which there was
to take cognizance of his cause. Besides, it was not his interest
alone which would be affected by the result. Hundreds, citizens of the State of Ohio and citizens of other States, are concerned in the question. Millions of money in that State, and
millions upon millions of banking capital in the other States,
are to be affected by its judicial decision; all depending upon
the assertion, in opposition to the claim of the complainant, that
a new constitution of a State supersedes every legislative enactment touching its own internal policy, and bearing upon the
interest of persons, which may have been the subject of legislation under a preceding constitution. In the words of the counsel for the defendant, that all such legislation must give way
when found to contravene the will of the sovereign people, subsequently expressed in a new state constitution. The assertion
may be met and confuted, without further argument, by what

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

Dodge v. Woolsey.

was said by Mr. Madison, in the 48d number of The Federalist,
upon the 6th article of the constitution, which is: "All debts
and engagements entered into before the adoption of this constitution shall be as valid against the United States under
this constitution as under the confederation." His remark is,
"This can only be considered as a declaratory proposition, and
may have been inserted, among other reasons, for the satisfaction of foreign creditors, who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine, that a change in the political form of civil
society has the magical effect of dissolving its moral obligations."
And here we will cite another passage from the writings of
that great statesman, and venerated man'by every citizen of the
United States who knows how much his political wisdom contributed to the establishment of our American popular institutions. He says, in the 22d number of The Federalist: "A
circumstance which shows the defects of the confederation
remains to be mentioned,-the want of a judiciary power.
Laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define
their true meaning and operation. The treaties of the United
States, to have any force at all, must be considered as a part of
the law of the land. Their true import, as regards individuals,
must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations. To produce uniformity in these determinations, they
ought to be submitted to a supreme tribunal; and this tribunal
ought to be instituted under the same authorities which form
the treaties themselves. These ingredients are both indispensable. If there is in each State a court of final jurisdiction, there
may be as many different final determinations on the same point
as there are courts. There are endless diversities in the opinions
of men. We often see not only different courts, but the judges
of the same court, differing from each other. To avoid the confusion which would unavoidably result from the contradictory
decisions of a number of independent judicatures, all nations
have found it necessary to establish one tribunal paramount to
the rest, possessing a general superintendence, and authorized
to settle and declare in the last resort a uniform rule of civil
justice. This is the more necessary where the frame of the
government is so compounded that the laws of the whole are in
danger of being contravened by the laws of the parts. In this
case, if the particular tribunals are invested with a right of ultimate decision, besides the contradictions to be expected from
difference of opinion, there will be much to fear from the bias of
local views and prejudices, and from the interference of local
institutions. As often as such an interference should happen,
there would be reason to apprehend that the provisions of the
particular laws might be preferred to those of the general laws,

358

from the deference with which men in office naturally look up to
that authority to which they owe their official existence."
Hitherto we have shown from the constitution itself that the
framers of it meant to provide a jurisdiction for its final interpretation, and for the laws passed by Congress, to give them an
equal operation in all of the States.
But there are considerations out of the constitution which
contribute to show it, which we will briefly mention. Without
such a judicial tribunal there are no means provided by which
the conflicting legislation of the States with the constitution
and the laws of congress may be terminated, so as to give to
either a national operation in each of the States. In such an
event uo means have been provided for an amicable accommodation; none for a compromise; none for mediation; none for
arbitration ; none for a congress of the States as a mode of conThe consequence of which would be a permanent
ciliation.
diversity of the operation of the constitution in the States, as
well in matters exclusively of public concern as in those which
secure individual rights. Fortunately it is not so. A supreme
tribunal has been provided, which has hitherto, by its decisions,
settled all differences which have arisen between the authorities
of the States and those of the United States. The legislation
under which its appellate power is exercised has been of sixtyseven years' duration, without any countenanced attempt to repeal it. It is rather late to question it ; and in continuing to
exercise it, this court complies with the decisions of its predecessors, believing, after the fullest examination, that its appellate
jurisdiction is given in conformity with the constitution.
The last position taken by the counsel for the defendant, now
the appellant here, is, that George C. Dodge was in the discharge of his official duty as treasurer of Cuyahoga county in
the State of Ohio, when interrupted by the mandate of the
circuit court; that the tax in his hands for collection against the
bank was regularly assessed under a valid law of the State,
passed April 18, 1852, in conformity with the requisitions of the
constitution, adopted June 17, 1851, which took effect 1st September, 1851.
It was admitted, in the argument of it, that the only difference
between this case and that of the Piqua Branch of the State
of Ohio v. Jacob Knoop, 16 Howard, 869, is, that the latter was
a claim for a tax under a law of Ohio, of March 21, 1851, under
the former constitution of Ohio,. of 1802; and that the tax
now claimed is assessed under the act of April 18, 1852, under
the new constitution of Ohio.
Both acts, in effect, are the same in their operation upon the
charter of the bank, as that was passed by the general assembly

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

of Ohio, in the year 1845. Each of them is intended to collect,
by way of tax, a larger sum than the bank was liable to pay,
under the charter of 1845. This is admitted. It is not denied,
the record shows that the tax assessed for the year 1853 exceeds
the sum to which it was liable, under its charter, $11,565i%.
The tax assessed is $ 14,771-1%. The tax which it would have
paid, under the act of 1845, would have been 8 3,206!h.
The fact raises the question whether the tax now cAaimed has
not been assessed in violation of the 10th section of the 1st article
of the constitution, which declares that no State shall pass any
law impairing the obligation of contracts.
The law of 1845 was an agreement with the bank, quasi ex
contractu, - and also an agreement separately with the shareholders, quasi ex contractu,- that neither the bank as such, nor
the shareholders as suQh, should be liable to any other tax larger
than that which was to be levied under the 60th section of the
act of 1845.
That 60th section is, "that each banking company under the
act, on accepting thereof and complying with its provisions,
shall semiannually, on the days designated for declaring dividends, set off to the State six per cent on the profits, deducting
therefrom the expenses and ascertained losses of the company
for the six months next preceding, which sum or amount so set
off shall be in lien of all taxes to which the company, or the
stockholders therein, would otherwise be subject. The sum so set
off to be paid to the treasurer, on the order of the auditor of the
State." The act under which the tax of 1853 has been assessed
is: "That the president and cashier of every bank and banking
company that shall have been, or may hereafter be, incorporated
by the laws of this State, and having the right to issue bills of
circulation as money, shall make and return, under oath, to the
auditor of the county in which such bank or banking company
may be situated, in the month of May annually, a written statement containing, first, the average amount of notes and bills discounted or purchased, which amount shall include all the loans
or discounts, whether originally made or renewed during the
year aforesaid, or at any previous time, whether made on bills of
exchange, notes, bonds, or mortgages, or any other evidence of
indebtedness, at their actual cost value in money, whether due
previous to, during, or after the period aforesaid, and on which
such banking company has at any time reserved or received, or
is entitled to receive, any profit or other consideration whatever;
and, secondly, the average amount of all other moneys, effects,
or dues of every description belonging to the bank or banking
company, loaned, invested, or otherwise used with a view to profit, or upon which the bank, &c., receives, or is entitled to receive, interest."

SUPREME

COURT.

Dodge v. Woolsey.

The two acts have been put in connection, that the difference
between the modes of taxation may be more obvious; and it
will be readily seen, that the second is not intended to tax the
profits of the bank, but its entire business, capital, circulation,
credits, and debts due to it, being professed to be intended to
equalize the tax to be paid by the bank with that required to be
paid upon personal property. A careful examination of the two
acts, and of the tabular returns annexed to this opinion, will
prove that such equality of taxation has not been attained. It
will show that the bank is taxed more than three times the
number of mills upon the dollars that is assessed upon personal
property, whatever may be comprehended under that denomination by the act of the 13th April, 1852. But if it did not, it
could make no difference in our conclusion. For the tax to be
paid by the bank under the act of 24th, February, 1824, is a
legislative contract, equally operative upon the State and upon
the bank, and the stockholders of the bank, until the expiration
of its charter, which will be in 1866. No critical examination
of the words, "that on the days designated for declaring dividends, to wit, on the first Monday in May and November of
each year, the bank shall set off to the said State of Ohio six
per cent on the profits, deducting therefrom the expenses and
ascertained losses of said company for six months next preceding
each dividend day, and that the sums or amounts so set off
shall be in lieu of all taxes to which said company or the stockholders thereof on account of stock owned therein would otherwise be subject," could make them more exact in meaning than
they are. The words "would otherwise be sulject," relate to
the legislative power to tax, and is a relinquishment of it, binding upon that legislature whiel passed the act, and upon succeeding legislatures as a contract not to tax the bank during its
continuance with more than six per cent upon its semiannual
profits. A change of constitution cannot release a State from
contracts made under a constitution which permits them to be
made. The inquiry is, Is the contract permitted by the existing
coustitution? If so, and that cannot be denied in this case, the
sovereignty which ratified it in 1802 was the same sovereignty
which made the constitution of 1851, neither having more power
than the other to impair a contract made by the state legislature with individuals. The moral obligations never die. If
broken by states and nations, though the terms of reproach are
not the same with which we are accustomed to designate the
faithlessness of individuals, the violation of justice is not the
less.
This case is coincident with that of the Piqua Branch of the
State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 16 How. 369, dcided by this

The following resolutions have been adopted by the directors of this bank: Resolred, That in the opinion of the directors of the Commercial Branch Bank of
Cleveland, that the act for the assessment and taxation of all property in this State,and for levying taxes thereon according to its true value in money, passed April 13,
1852, so far as it imposes a tax on this bank or banking company, or the listing or
valuing of its property different from that required by its charter, without the consent
of the corporators, is unconstitutional and void, and is also repugnant to the constitution of the State of Ohio, -which declares that all laws shall be passed taxing by uniform rule all investments in stock or otherwise, and that property employed in banking
shall bear a burden of taxation equal to that imposed on the property of individuals;
and, again, - that the property of corporations now existing or hereafter created, shall
be forever subject to taxation the same as the property of individuals, and therefore
creates no legal liability against this bank, and that this bank will not, as at present
advised, pay such additional tax unless compelled by law, and hereby enters its protest against its imposition and collection.
Resolved, That the cashier attach a copy of these resolutions, signed by the president and cashier of this bank, to the return of this bank, made under said law. Also

Mr. Justice CAMPBELL dissenting.
The following case is made upon the record of this cause: The Commercial Bank of Cleveland, Ohio, was organized in
1845, according to the act of the general assembly of February, 1845, for the incorporation of the State Bank of Ohio
and other companies, with a capital which was increased in
1848 to $ 175,000, and placed under the management of five
directors.
From its organization until 1851 the taxes of the bank were
determined by the 60th section of the act aforesaid, which required the banks semiannually to set off to the State six per
cent of the net profits for the six months next preceding, and
the sum so set off the act declared should be "in lieu of all taxes

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

363

Dodge v. Woolsey.

to which such company or the stockholders thereof on account
of stock owned therein would otherwise be subject." In the
year 1851, the general assembly of Ohio altered this rule of taxation, and required that the capital stock, surplus and contingent
funds of the banks should be listed for taxation at their money
value, and should be assessed for the same purposes and to the
same extent that personal property might be in the place of their
location.
During the same year the people of Ohio, in the mode prescribed in their fundamental law, adopted a new constitution.
One of the articles (art. 12, ยง 3) requires "the general assembly
to provide by law for taxing the notes and bills discounted or
purchased, and all other property, effects, dues of every description (without deduction) of all banks now existing or hereafter
created, and of all bankers, so that all property employed in
banking shall always bear a burden of taxation equal to that
imposed on the property of individuals." In 1852, the general
assembly fulfilled this direction by a law which required the
banks to disclose the average amount of all bills, notes discounted
or purchased, and the average amount of their moneys,. dues
and effects, so as to afford a basis for taxation: and by the same
act taxes were directed to be laid upon these amounts without
deduction.
The directors, stockholders, and officers of this bank have disputed the validity of these changes in the rule of taxation, as
violating a right derived by contract, obligatory on the State,
and contained in the 60th section of the act first mentioned, and
no voluntary obedience has been rehdered to them; but, on the
contrary, the successive measures taken for the collection of
these taxes have met with opposition from the corporation, and
submission has always been accompanied with a protest on the
part of the directors, in which their determination was expressed
to rely upon the constitutional and legal rights of the bank.
The taxes for the year 1852 were collected in current bank
bills, and the packages were prepared and placed within the
reach of the treasurer, who held the duplicate for collection, by
the officers of the bank, and immediately after they were assigned
by the bank to one Deshler, who replevied the same by a writ
from the circuit court of the United States for Ohio, and thus
made a case which subsequently came to this court. Deshler v.
Dodge, 16 How. 622.
In December, 1853, some five days before the taxes were payable, John M. Woolsey, a stockholder of the bank for thirty shares,
at the par value of $100 each, addressed the directors of the
bank a letter, requiring them " to instituite the proper legal proceedings to prevent the collection" of the assessment for that

364

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

year, averring that the bank was not bound to pay them. The
board of directors replied, "that they considered the tax to have
been illegally assessed, but in consideration of the many obstacles in the way of resisting said tax in the courts of Ohio they
could not take the action they were called upon in the letter to
take," but must leave to Mr. Woolsey to take such a course as
he might be advised. It sufficiently appears that the treasurer
is able to pdy any damages which the bank might sustain, and
no evidence exists of any indisposition of the directors to meet
all the obligations of their station, except what is found in the
letter I have described.
This bill was filed by Woolsey, as a stockholder of the bank,
against the treasurer of the county of Cuyahoga, the five directors of the bank, and the corporation itself, alleging his apprehensions that the treasurer would proceed to make the collection
of the excess above the tax due under the 60th section, and that
it would impair the credit of the bank, invade its franchise, and
ultimately compel its dissolution; and that the directors had refused to take measures to prevent its collection, on his requisition, and prays for an injunction on the officer to restrain his
further proceedings. The circuit court affirmed the bill so as to
restrain the collection of all taxes assessed upon the bank,
except such as were laid under the act of 1845.
The first inquiry that arises is, Has this court a jurisdiction of
the parties to the suit ? The case is one of a stockholder of a
corporation, bringing the corporation before the courts of United
States to redress a corporate wrong in which both are similarly
interested. The early decisions of this court on this question
would be conclusive against the bill. They require that the
plaintiff should be from a State different from all the individual members of the corporation. The chief justice said, that
invisible, intangible, and artificial being, that mere legal entity
-a
corporation aggregate -is certainly not a citizen ; and consequently cannot sue or be sued in the courts of the United
States, unless the rights of the members in this respect can be
exercised in their corporate name. 5 Cranch, 57, 61, 78;
6 Wheat. 450; 14 Pet. 60.
These cases required that the citizenship of all the corporators
should appear on the record, so that the court might be sure that
the controversy had arisen between citizens of different States,
or citizens of a State and foreign states, citizens or subjects.
In Marshall v. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co. 16 How. 314,
the court relaxed its strictness in reference to this averment, and
was satisfied by an allegation of the habitat of the corporation,
but still intimated that the national character of the corporators
was an essential subject of inquiry in a question of jurisdiction.

DECEMBER

TERM, 1855.

365

Dodge v. Woolsey.

The court says: "The persons who act under these faculties and
use the corporate name, may be justly presumed to be resident
in the State which is the necessary habitat of the corporation,
and where alone they can be made subject to suit, and should be
estopped in equity from averring a different domicile as against
those who are compelled to seek them there, and nowhere else."
And again: "1The presumption arising from the habitat of a corporation being conclusive of those who use the corporate name
and exercise the faculties of it."
This case is one of a corporator suing the corporation of which
he is a member, and is the first instance of such a case in the
court. He cannot aver against the manifest truth, that all the
corporators, himself included, are of a different State from himself, to give the court jurisdiction upon the principle of the earlier cases. And if the doctrine of an equitable estoppel can be
applied to a subject where facts, and not arbitrary presumptions,
were the only objects of consideration; and if, indeed, the character of the corporator, as a matter of law, is to be assumed to be
that of the situs of the corporation, then all the corporators, plaintiffs as well as defendants, stand upon this record as citizens of
the same State, and this suit cannot be maintained. But if no
inquiry into the citizenship of stockholders may be made; if a
foreign stockholder, upon the real or affected indifference of a
board of directors, or on some imaginary or actual obstacle to relief, arising in the state of opinion in the courts of the State, can
draw questions of equitable cognizance into the courts of the
United States, in which corporate rights are involved, or evils
are threatened or inflicted on corporate property, making the
corporation and its managers parties, then a very compendious
method of bringing into the courts of the United States all questions in which these artificial beings are concerned has been invented, and the most morbid appetite for jurisdiction among all
their various members will be gratified, and upon a class of cases
where grave doubts exist whether those who made the constitution ever intended to confer any jurisdiction whatever. Nor can
this jurisdiction be supported by affirming that the corporation
is not a necessary party to the bill. The subject of the bill is the
title of the corporation to an exemption under the act of incorporation, and its object is the protection of corporate franchises
and property. The being of the corporation is charged to be an
issue involved in the prayer for relief, and the inaction of the
directors affords the motive for the suit.
The conduct of the directors was determined in the course of
their duty as the governing body of the corporation., under the
law of their organization. Their measures and judgments were
the acts of the corporation. Whether these were conclusive

upon the corporators, or whether they might be impeached at
the suit of a single dissenting shareholder; whether the relations
between the State and the corporation were to be settled in a
suit between them or in this suit, are the matters in issue, and
the corporation was an essential party to their adjudication.
The principle of the bill is, that in declining to take effective
measures of prevention -that is, refusing to apply for an injunction - the directors abdicated their controlling powers, and any
stockholder became entitled to intervene for the interests of himself, and his associates. The decree in this cause is not a decree
for the relief of this corporator, but is a decree for the corporation, and does not differ from a decree proper to a case of the
corporation against the treasurer. It is clear, therefore, that the
corporation was a necessary party to the bill, and so are the adjudged cases. Bagshaw v. East. Union R. R. Co. 7 Hare, 114 ;
Cunningham v. Pell, 5 Paige, 607'; Rumney v. Monce, Finch R.
334, 336; 1 Danl. Ch. Pr. 251; Charles. Ins. & T. Co. v. Sebring,
5 Rich. Eq. R. 842.
The case is one between a corporator and the corporation, and
the jurisdiction cannot be affirmed unless the court is prepared
to answer the question whether a mere legal entity, an artificial
person, invisible, intangible, can be a citizen of the United States
in the sense in which that word is used in the constitution; and
relying upon the case of Marshall v. The Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad Company, with a long list of antecessors, I am forced
to conclude that it cannot be.
The court has assumed this jurisdiction, and I am therefore
called to inquire whether a court of chancery can take cognizance
of the bill ? The act of incorporation of the bank charges the
board of directors with the care of the corporate affairs, subject
to an annual responsibility to the stockholders. The principle of
a court of chancery is, to decline any interference with the discretion of such directors, or to regulate their conduct or management in respect to the duties committed to them.
The business of that court is to redress grievances illegally inflicted or threatened, not to supply the prudence, knowledge, or
forecast requisite to successful corporate management. The facts
of this case involve, in my opinion, merely a question of discretion in the performance of an official duty. In 1852, the taxes
were withdrawn from the treasurer of Cuyahoga county, by an
assignee of the bank, .and were never passed into the State
treasury. The supreme court of Ohio, subsequently to this,
pronounced the taxes to be legally assessed upon these banks,
and that there was no contract between the State and the banks,
and there was no exemption from the tax by anything apparent
in the act of 1845. Some of these judgments were pending in

ECEMBER TERM, 1855.

this court upon writs of error then undecided, no judgment having been given contrary to that of the authorities, legislative,
executive, and judicial, as well as by the people of Ohio. It was
under these conditions that this stockholder, who purchased stock
after the controversy had arisen in Ohio, some five days before
the taxes were payable, addressed the directors of the Commercial
I suppose, to file a
Bank to take preventive measures -that is,
bill for an injunction instantly -and, upon their suggestion of
difficulties, proceeds to take charge of the corporate rights of the
bank by this suit, in the circuit court of the United States. The
directors were elected annually; they were, collectively, owners
of one tenth of the stock of the bank, and no evidence is shown
that any other stockholder supposed that "preventive measures,"
under the circumstances, could be sustained. There is no charge
of fraud, collusion, neglect of duty, or of indifference by the directors, save this omission to take some undefined "preventive
measures," which the plaintiff affected to suppose might be
proper.
I understand the rule of chancery, in reference to such a casei
to be that no suit can be maintained by an individual stockholder for a wrong done, or threatened, to such a corporation,
unless it appears that the plaintiff has no means of procuring a
suit to be instituted in the name of the corporation; and that
the rule is universal, applicable, as well to the cases where the
acts which afford the ground for complaint were either such
as a majority might sanction, or whether it belonged to the
category of those acts by which no stockholder could be bound
except by his own consent. This principle has the highest sanction in the decisions of that court. (Foss v. Harbottle, 2 Hare,
461- affirmed 1 Phil. 790 ; 2 Phil. 740 ; 7 Hare, 130.) The principle is an obvious consequence from the relations between the
officers and members of a chartered corporation, and the corporation itself. These are explained in Smith v. Hurd, 12 Met.
371. The court says: "There is no legal privity, relation, or
immediate connection between the holders of shares in a bank
in their individual capacity, on the one side, and the directors
of the bank on the other. The directors are not the boilers, the
factors, agents, or trustees of such individual stockholders. The
bank is a corporation and body politic having a separate existence, as a distinct person in law, in whom the whole stock and
property of the bank are vested, and to whom all agents, debtors,
officers, and servants are responsible for all contracts, express or
implied, made in reference to such capital; and for all torts and
injuries, diminishing or impairing it." The corporation, therefore, must vindicate its own wrongs, and assert its own rights,
in the modes pointed out by law.

368

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

I do not say that a court of chancery will never permit an individual stockholder to come before it to assert a right of the
corporation in which he is a shareholder, where there is an obstacle of such a nature that the name of the corporation cannot
be employed before legitimate tribunals in their regular modes
of proceeding, but the burden is thrown upon the plaintiff to
establish the existence of an urgent necessity for such a suit.
The consideration of analogous cases will strengthen this conclusion; cases where courts of chancery are more free to interven, from the fiduciary relations between the parties and the
extent of its general jurisdiction over them. Such are cases of
danger to the interests of a creditor of an estate from the collusion of an executor with the debtor of the estate, or the insolvency of the executor ; or where an executor wrongfully fails to
make a settlement with a surviving partner, and a residuary
legatee seeks one entire settlement of the estate against the
executor and partner; or where a decedent in his life has fraudulently conveyed assets, and his executor is estopped to impute
fraud, and there are creditors; or where the managers of a jointstock company have been guilty of fraud, illegality, waste, and
their stockholders desire relief. In all these cases the court of
chancery will suffer a party remotely interested to institute the
suit which his trustee, or other representative, should have
brought, and will grant the relief on that suit which would have
been appropriate to the case of him who should have commenced
it. Sir John Romilly, in a late case belonging to one of these
categories, says :
"To support such a bill as this it is not sufficient to prove
that it may be an unpleasant duty to the executors and trustees
to take the necessary steps for protecting the property intrusted
to them. It is not sufficient to show that it will be for their interests not to take such steps. It is necessary to show that they
prefer their own interests to their duty, and that they intend to
neglect the performance of the obligation incidental to the office
imposed upon them. and which they assumed to perform; or, as
said in Travis v. Mylne, that a substantial impediment to the
prosecution by the executors of the rights of the parties interested
in the estate against the surviving partner exists." Stainton v.
Carron Co. 23 L. & Eq. 315; Travis v. Mlylne, 9 Hare, 141;
Hersey v. Veazie, 11 Shep. 1; Colquitt v. Howard, 11 Geo. 556.
These cases afford no support to this suit. The Cleveland
Bank has betrayed no purpose to abandon its corporate duty.
The interests and obligations of the directors coincide to support
its pretensions. There is no supineness in their past conduct,
nor indifference to the existing peril. The evidence, at the most,
convicts them only of a present disinclination to commence suits,

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

which were likely to be unproductive, at the request of a single
shareholder. The answer shows that the taxes for 1852 had not
been recovered by the State, but had been retaken by an assignee of the bank. Nor does the correspondence show that the
directors had decided to abandon the contest. The case here
does not at all fulfil the conditions on which the interposition of
a shareholder is allowable. Elmslie v. McAulay, 3 Bro. 0. 0.
224, 1 Phil. 790; Law v. Law, 2 Coll. 41; Walker v. Trott, 4
Ed. Ch. R. 38.
But the evidence does not allow me to conclude that any impediment whatever existed to a suit in the name of the corporation, from any disposition of the directors to resist the claims of
the State. Their protest appears at every successive stage of
the action of the fiscal officers. This suit is evidently maintained with their consent; there has been no appearance either
by the directors or the corporation, but they abide the case of

tion. The question then is, can a corporation belonging to a
State, and whose officers are citizens, upon some hope or assurance that the opinions of the courts of the United States are
more favorable to their pretensions, by any combination, contrivance, or agreement with a non-resident shareholder, devolve
upon him the right to seek for the redress of corporate grievances,
which are the subjects of equitable cognizance in the courts of
the United States, by a suit in his own name. In my opinion,
there should be but one answer to the question.
I come now to the merits of the case made by the bill.
In the suit of the Piqua Bank v. Knoop, 16 How. 369, I gave
the opinion that the act of February, 1845, did not contain a
contract obligatory between the State of Ohio and the banking
corporations which might be originated by it, in reference to the
rule of taxation to be applied to their capital or business. That
the act imposed no limit upon the power of the general assembly
of the State, but that the rate of taxation established in that act
was alterable at their pleasure. To that opinion I now adhere.
But assuming a contract to be collected from the indeterminate expressions of the 60th section of the act, as interpreted by
its general objects and the supposed policy of the State, the
question is presented, what consequence did the reconstitution
of the political system of the State by the people in 1851, and
their direction to the legislature to adopt equality as the rule of
assessment of taxes upon corporate property, accomplish to the
claims of these corporations?
Certainly no greater question - none involving a more elemental or important principle - has ever been submitted to a judicial

370

SUPREM1E COURT.

tribunal. It involves the operation and efficiency of the fundamental principles on which the American constitutions have
been supposed to rest.
The proposition of this confederacy of some fifty banking corporations, having one fortieth of the property of the State, is,
that by the law of their organization for the whole term of their
corporate being, there exists no power in the government nor
people of Ohio to impair the concessions contained in the act
of 1845, particularly that determining the amount of their contribution to the public revenue. This proposition does not depend for its truth upon the limitation of time imposed upon the
corporate existence of the banks. It would *notaffect the proposition if the charters were for a century, or in perpetuity. Nor
does the proposition derive strength from the fact that the statute applies only to banking corporations, or corporations confined to a single form of commercial dealing. The proposition
would have had the same degree of accuracy if the act had been
universal, applicable to all private corporations, whether for
manufactures, trade, intercourse, mining, morals, or religion. It
is said by a competent authority, that in the State of Massachusetts there are near twenty-five hundred trading corporations, and
that more than seven tenths of the real and personal property of
that State is held by corporations. The proportion between the
property of corporations and individuals is greater there than in
other States, but the property held by corporations in other States
is large enough to awaken the most earnest attention. A concession of the kind contained in this act, by a careless or a corrupt legislature, for a term or in perpetuity, would impair in
many States their resources to an alarming extent.
Writers upon the condition of the Turkish empire say, that
three fourths of the landed property of the empire is held in
mortmain, as vakuf by mosques or charitable institutions, for
their own use, or in trust for their owners. This property ceases
to contribute to the public revenues, except in a specific form of
certain objectionable taxes on produce, and is inalienable. If held
in trust, it is exempt from forced sales and confiscations, and, on
the death of the owner without children, passes to the mosque
or other charitable trustee. In that empire, the ecclesiastical and
judicial is the dominant interest, for the Ulemas are both priests
and lawyers, just as the corporate moneyed interest is dominant
in Ohio, and in either country that interest claims exemption
from the usual burdens and ordinary legislation of the State.
The judgment of this court would establish the permanent existence of such an incubus upon the resources and growth of that
country, if that interest should have taken their privilegs in the
form of a contract, and had such a constitution as ours. Yet the

DECEMBER TER.A,

first step for the regeneration of Turkey, according to the wisest
statesmanship, is to abolish the vakuf.
Bentham, treating upon constitutional provisions in favor of
contracts, says : "If all contracts were to be observed, all misdeeds would be to be committed, for there is no misdeed the
committal of which may not be made the subject of a contract;
and to establish in favor of themselves, or of any other person
or persons, an absolute despotism, a set of legislators would
have no more to do than to enter into any engagement-say
with a foreign despot, say with a member of their own community-for this purpose." And were this to happen, should it be
that a State of this Union had become the victim of vicious legislation, its property alienated, its powers of taxation renounced in
favor of chartered associations, dnd the resources of the body
politic cut off, what remedy has the people against the misgovernment ? Under the doctrines of this court none is to be found
in the government, and none exists in the inherent powers of the
people, if the wrong has taken the form of a contract. The most
deliberate and solemn acts of the people would not serve to redress the injustice, and the overreaching speculator upon the
facility or corruption of their legislature would be protected by
the powers of this court in the profits of his bargain. Where
would the people find a remedy ? Let the case before us form
an illustration. Congress cannot limit the term nor abolish the
privileges of these corporations; they are corporations of Ohio,
and beyond her limits they have no legal existence; they live in
the contemplation of her laws and dwell in the place of their creation. (18 Pet. 512; 16 How. 314.) Nor can congress enlarge
the subjects for state taxation, nor interfere in the support of the
state government. They could not empower the State to collect
taxes from these corporations. Were the resources of the State
oppressed with the burden of a Turkish vakuf, congress could
not afford relief.
The faculties of the judicial department are even more fatal
to the State than the impotence of congress. The courts cannot
look to the corruption, the blindness, nor mischievous effects of
state legislation, to determine its binding operation. (Fletcher
v. Peck, 6 Cr. 87.) The court, therefore, becomes the patron of
such legislation, by furnishing motives of incalculable power to
the corporations to stimulate it, and affording stability and
security to the successful effort. Where, then, is the remedy for
the people? They have none in their state government nor in
themselves, and the federal government is enlisted by their adversary. It may be that an amendment of the constitution of
the United States, by the proposal of two thirds of congress and
the ratification of the legislatures of three fourths of the States,

COURT.

might enable the people of Ohio to assess taxes for the support of
their government, upon terms of equality among her citizens.
The first observation to be made upon this is, that these extraordinary pretensions of corporations are not unfamiliar to an
inquirer into their nature and history. The steady aim of the
most thoroughly organized and powerful of the corporate establishments of Europe has ever been to place themselves under
the protection of an external authority, superior to the govern
ment and people where they dwell- an authority sufficiently
powerful to shield them from responsibility and to secure their
privileges from question. I do not refer to the claim of kings to
passive obedience under a divine title. Ecclesiastical corporations, acknowledging the supremacy of the Pope, afford a case
parallel to that before us. I find their principles compendiously
declared in an allocution of a minister of Rome to the court of
Sardinia, in reference to taxes on church property there. I find
that "religious corporations, forming a portion of the ecclesiastical family at large, are by their very nature, under the guardianship and authority of the church; and, consequently, no measure or laws can be adopted with respect to .them, except by the
spiritual power, or through its agency, especially in what touches
their existence or their conduct in the institutions to which they
respectively belong; nor can any other rule be recognized, even
in matters that concern their property. It is, in truth, beyond
dispute that the property possessed by ecclesiastical or religious
foundations belongs to the general category of property of the
church, and constitutes a true and proper portion of its patrimony. In consequence whereof, as the property of the church
is inviolable, so are the possessions of such foundations." Nor
was the doctrine of the inviolableness of contracts foreign to
these controversies. The sagacious and far-sighted members of
the ecclesiastical interests fortified themselves with concordats,
and these concordats were affirmed to be "contracts," and, like
these, "1entail obligations" ; and "if the bond of a bargain is to
be respected in private life," so they declared "it is sacred and
inviolable in the life of States." A slight change of expression
will demonstrate that the principle of corporate policy, the dictate of corporate ambition, which has predominated in the contests in Europe, leading to desolating wars, is the same which
this court is required to sanction in favor of corporations in the
United States. The allocution of the Ohio banks to this court
may be thus stated: "That the charters of incorporation granted
by the state governments are in their essence and nature ' contracts,' which ' entail obligations'; that, consequently, they are
finally under the guardianship and protection of the judiciary
establishment of the United States; that no acts of the state

legislature which conferred them, in whatever touches their existence, methods of proceeding, or corporate privilege, are binding on them; that, as the state legislatures are agents of the
people, whatever they have done in these respects is obligatory
upon them, and irrevocable by them, in any form of their action,
or in the exercise of any of their sovereign authority; and as the
judiciary establishment of the Union is charged with the duty
of holding the States and people to their limited orbits, and to
afford redress for violated contracts, and to prevent serious resulting damage; and as these corporations cannot sue in the
courts of the United States, it is the duty of the court to suffer
the corporate wrongs to be redressed in the suit and at the solicitation of any of their stockholders who can appear there -for
the state of opinion in the state courts will not allow the hope of
redress from them."
The allowance of this plea interposes this court between these
corporations and the government and people of Ohio, to which
they owe their existence, and by whose laws they derive all their
faculties. It will establish on the soil of every State a caste
made up of combinations of men for the most part under the
most favorable conditions in society, who will habitually look
beyond the institutions and the authorities of the State to the
central government for the strength and support necessary to
maintain them in the enjoyment of their special privileges and
exemptions. The consequence will be a new element of alienation and discord between the different classes of society, and the
introduction of a fresh cause of disturbance in our distracted
political and social system. In the end, the doctrine of this decision may lead to a violent overturn of the whole system of corporate combinations.
Having thus examined the proportions of the doctrine contained in the judgment of the court, I oppose to it a deliberate
and earnest dissent.
And, first, as to the claim made for the court to be the final
arbiter of these questions of political power, I can imagine no
pretension more likely to be fatal to the constitution of the court
itself. If this court is to have an office so transcendent as to
decide finally the powers of the people over persons and things
within the State, a much closer connection and a much more
direct responsibility of its members to the people is a necessary
condition for the safety of the popular rights. Justice Woodbury, in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 52, has exposed this danger
with great discrimination and force. He said: "Another evil,
alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges, would be, that in such
an event all political privileges and rights would in a dispute

among the people depend on our decision finally. We would
possess the power to decide against them, as well as for them;
and, under a prejudiced or arbitrary judiciary, the public liberties
or popular privileges might thus be much perverted, if not
entirely prostrated. And if the people, in the distribution of
powers under the constitution, should ever think of making
judges supreme arbiters in political controversies, when not
selected by nor amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow the
various considerations that belong to political questions in their
judgments, they will dethrone themselves, and lose one of their
invaluable birthrights, - building up in this way slowly, but
surely, a new sovereign power in this republic in most respects
irresponsible, unchangeable for life, and one, in theory at least,
more dangerous than the worst elective monarchy in the worst
of times."
The inquiry recurs, have the people of Ohio deposited with
this tribunal the authority to overrule their own judgment upon
the extent of their own powers over institutions created by their
own government and commorant within the State? The fundamental principle of American constitutions, it seems to me,
is, that to the people of the several States belongs the resolution
of all questions, whether of regulation, compact, or punitive justice, arising out of the action of their municipal government
upon their citizens, or depending upon their constitutions and
laws, and are judges of the validity of alt acts done by their
municipal authorities in the exercise of their sovereign rights, in
either case without responsibility or control from any department of the federal government. This I understand to be the
impor=t of the municipal sovereignty cf the people within the
State.
Ln 1802, the inhabitants of Ohio were released from their
pupilage to the federal authority, placed in full possession of
their rights to self-government, and were invited to adapt their
institutions to the federal system, of which the State, when
formed, was authorized to become a member.
The people of Ohio, by their state constitution, reserved to
themselves "complete power" to "alter, reform, and abolish their
government" ; "to petition for redress of grievances"; and to
"recur, as often as might be necessary, to the first principles of
government." It was by a constitution adopted according to
established forms, and expressive of the sovereign will of the
body politic, that the rule of taxation complained of in this suit
was prescribed.
The inquiry arises, to what did the authority of the people
extend? It was their right to ameliorate every vicious institution, and to do whatever an enlightened statesmanship might

DECEMBER TERM, 1855.

375

Dodge v. Woolsey.

prescribe for the advancement of their own happiness; and for
this end, persons and things in the State were submitted to their
authority. A material distinction has always been acknowledged to exist as to the degrees of the authority that a people
could legitimately exert over persons and corporations. Individuals are not the creatures of the State, but constitute it.
They come into society with rights, which cannot be invaded
without injustice. But corporations derive their existence from
the society, are the offspring of transitory conditions of the
State; and, with faculties for good in such conditions, combine
durable dispositions for evil. They display a love of power, a
preference for corporate interests to moral or political principles
or public duties, and an antagonism to individual freedom,
which have marked them as objects of jealousy in. every epoch
of their history. Therefore, the power has been exercised, in
all civilized States, to limit their privileges, or to suppress their
existence, under the exigencies either of public policy or political
necessity.
Sir James McIntosh says: "Property is indeed, in some sense,
created by act of the public will, but it is by one of those fundamental acts which constitute society. Theory proves it to be
essential to the social state. Experience proves that it has, in
some degree, existed in every age and nation of the world. But
those public acts, which form and endow corporations, are subsequent and subordinate. They are only ordinary expedients of
legislation. The property of individuals is established on a
general principle, which seems coeval with civil society itself.
But bodies are instruments fabricated by the legislature for a
specific purpose, which ought to be preserved while they are
beneficial, amended when they are impaired, and rejected when
they become useless or injurious." Vind. Gal. 48, note.
Who, in the United States, is to determine when the public
interests demand the suppression of bodies whose existence or
modes of action are contrary to the well-being of the state?
If the powers of the people of a State are inadequate to this
object, then their grave and solemn declarations of their rights
and their authority over their governments, and of the ends for
which their governments and the institutions of their governments were framed, and the responsibility of rulers and magistrates to themselves, are nothing but "great swelling words of
vanity."
But not only is the jurisdiction of Ohio "complete" over the
public institutions of her government, but the subject-matter
upon which their will was expressed in their constitution was
independently of their control over the corporations, one over
which their jurisdiction was plenary. They declared in what

376

SUPREME COURT.
Dodge v. Woolsey.

manner property held within the State by these artificial bodies
should contribute to the public support, in the form of regular
and apportioned taxation. When the constitution of the United
States was before the people of the States for their ratification,
they were told, that, with the exception of duties on exports and
imports, the States retained "an independent and uncontrollable
authority" to "raise their own revenue in the most absolute and
unqualified sense"; and that any attempt, on the part of the
federal government, to abridge them in the exercise of it, would
be "a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any clause
of the constitution." (Fed. 168, by Hamilton.) And the opinions of this court are filled with disclaimers on the same subject.
4 Wheat. 429.
The true principle, therefore, would seem to be, that if there
was any conflict in the tax laws of the State, and a supposed
contract of its legislative or executive agents with one of its citizens, it would be for the State to harmonize the two upon
principles of general equity; but in no condition of facts for the
judiciary department to interfere with state affairs by writs of
replevin or injunction. The acknowledgment of such a power
would be to establish the alarming doctrine that the empire of
Ohio, and the remaining States of the Union, over their revenues,
is not to be found in their people, but in the numerical majority
of the judges of this court.
In the opinion I gave in the case of the Piqua Bank,,1 exhibited evidence that the care of the public domain, whether
consisting of crown lands or of taxes on property, belonged to
the sovereign power of the State, and that improvident alienations by the crown were, from time to time, set aside by the parliament of Great Britain under the dictates of a public policy.
Twelve acts of parliament are cited by Sir William Davenant
of this character, and having this object. Davenant, Grants and
Res. 244.
A similar condition existed in France. The kings were bound,
by their coronation oath, "to maintain and preserve the public
domain with all their power," and it was an inviolable maxim,
that it could not be alienated, except in specified cases determined in the fundamental laws of the monarchy. This legal
result was declared by the national assembly in 1790, to the effect that the public domain, with all its accretions, belonged to
the nation; that this property is the most perfect that can be
imagined, since there exists no superior power that can restrain
or modify it; that the power to alienate - the essential attribute
of property - exists in the nation; that every appropriation of
the public domain is essentially revocable, if made without the
consent of the nation; that it preserves over the property alien-

ated the same right and authority as if it had remained under
its control; and that this principle was one which no lapse of
time nor legal formality could evade. All grants, therefore, of
the public rights, and especially those partaking of the nature
of taxes, or subsidies, such as fines, confiscations, and stamps,
were revoked, because the subject was not alienable. 8 Merlin
Rep., tit. Dor. Pub.; 1 Proud., Dom. Pub. 62.
If the power to review the illegal or improvident acts. of a
monarch, by which the domain and patrimony of the crown
(one of the principal sinews of the state, as they are termed in
the ordinances) was dilapidated or impoverished, in the nearly
absolute monarchies of Europe, was reserved to the nation, it
would seem to follow that in the American States, where so
little has been conceded to the government, and whose "complete power" to amend or abrogate is so distinctly reserved
that no inference nor implication can arise, that the same has
been relinquished or abdicated. My conclusion is, that the constitution of Ohio, whether it is to be regarded as the expression
of the sovereign will of the people, that the extraordinary exemptions granted to these corporations, by which they contribute
unequally to the public support, is contrary to the genius of their
institutions; or whether they are inconsistent with a just apportionment of the public burdens; or whether, as a declaration of
the exigency of the State, requiring an additional contribution
from them to its revenue; or a judgment of condemnation of
the former government for an abuse of the powers it enjoyed;
that it is above and beyond the supervision or control of the
judiciary department of this government.
Nor does the opinion, that this department can exert such an
empire over the people of Ohio, derive support, in my opinion,
from the clause in the constitution on the subject of the obligation of contracts, nor the decisions of this court upon that clause
of the constitution.
That the people of the States should have released their powers
over the artificial bodies which originate under the legislation of
their representatives, or over the improvident charges or concessions imposed by them upon its revenues, or over the acts of their
own functionaries, is not to be assumed. Such a surrender was
not essential to any policy of the Union, nor required by any confederate obligation. Such an abandonment could have served
no other interest than that of the corporations, or individuals
who might profit by the legislative acts themselves. Combinations of classes in society, united by the bond of a corporate
spirit, for the accumulation of power, influence, or wealth, by the
control of intercourse or trade, or the spiritual or moral concerns
of society, unquestionably desire limitations upon the sovereignty

of the people, and the existence of an authority upon which they
can repose in security and confidence. But the framers of the
constitution were imbued with no desire to call into existence
such combinations, nor dread of the sovereignty of the people.
They denied to congress the power to create, (3 Mad. Deb. 1576,)
and the most salutary jealousy was expressed in reference to
them. The people of the States, during the existence of the
confederation, suffered from the violation of private property by
their governments. In reconstituting their political system, they
abstained from delegating to the United States the powers to
emit bills of credit; to make anything but gold and silver a
tender in the payment of debts; to pass any bill of attainder or
ex post facto law, or law to impair the obligation of contracts,
except so far as necessary to a uniform law of bankruptcy; while
they protected property from unreasonable searches and seizures,
and the title from detriment, except in the due course of legal
proceeding.
The state governments were prohibited from any corresponding
legislation, either by their federal or stats constitutions.
The power to interfere with private contracts is one of the
most delicate and difficult, in its exercise, of any belonging to
the social system, and one which there is constant temptation to
abuse. That its exercise is sometimes necessary is proved by
the history of every civilized State. Its judicious exercise constitutes the titles of Solon and Sully to fame, and has been vindicated by the most enlightened statesmen. But the people reserved to themselves to determine the exigencies which should
call it into existence. The prohibition is a limitation upon the
ordinary government, and not upon the popular sovereignty. In
Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Or. 87, the chief justice doubted whether the
repeal of a grant, issued under a legislative act by the executive
of a State, was within the competence of the legislative authority;
and notices the distinction between acts of legislation and sovereignty, and treats the clause of the constitution under consideration as an inhibition on legislation. In Dartmouth College
v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 553, Mr. Webster presents the distinction with prominence in his argument. He says: "It is not
too much to assert that the legislature of New Hampshire would
not have been competent to pass the acts in question, and make
them binding on the plaintiffs, without their assent, even if there
had been in the constitution of the United States, or of New
Hampshire, no special restriction on their power, because these
acts are not the exercise of a power properly legislative .....
The British Parliament could not have annulled or revoked
this grant as an ordinary act of legislation. If it had done it at
all, it could only have been in virtue of that sovereign power

called omnipotent, which does not belong to any legislature of
the United States. The legislature of New Hampshire has the
same power over the charter which belonged to the king who
granted it, and no more. By the law of England, the power to
grant corporations is a part of the royal prerogative. By the
revolution, this power may be considered as having devolved on
the lenislature of the State, and it has been accordingly exercised
by the legislature. But the king cannot abolish a corporation,
or new-model it, or alter its powers, without its assent." ....
Chief Justice Marshall, in describing the jurisdiction of the
court over such contracts, says, it belongs to it "the duty of protecting from legislative violation those contracts which the constitution of the country has placed beyond legislative control."
And, in defining the object and extent of the prohibition, he says:
"Before the formation of the constitution, a course of legislation
had prevailed in many, if not in all the States, which weakened
the confidence of man in man, and embarrassed all transactions
between individuals by dispensing with a faithful performance of
engagements. To correct this mischief by restraining the power
which produced it, the state legislatures were forbidden to pass
any law impairing the obligation of contracts; that is, of contracts
respecting property under which some individual could claim a
right to something beneficial to himself." These selections from
opinions delivered in this court which have carried the prerogative jurisdiction of the court to its farthest limit, and portions of
which are not easily reconciled with a long series of cases subsequently decided, (Satterlee v. Mffatthewson, 2 Pet. 380; Charles
River Bridge, 11 Pet. 420; West River Bridge v. Dix, 6 How.
507, 8 How. 569, 10 How. 511,) show with clearness that this
court has not, till now, impugned the sovereignty of the people
of a State over these artificial bodies called into existence by their
own legislatures.
I have thus given the reasons for the opinion that the constitution of Ohio and the acts of her government, done by its special
authority and direction, are valid dispositions. It is no part of
my jurisdiction to inquire whether these public acts of the people
and the State were just or equitable. Those questions belong
entirely to themselves.
It may be that the people may abuse the powers with which
they are invested, and, even in correcting the abuses of their
government, may not in every case act with wisdom and circumspection.
But, for my part, when I consider the justice, moderation, the
restraints upon arbitrary power, the stability of social order, the
security of personal rights, and general harmony which existed
in the country before the sovereignty of governments was as-

operative principle, and governments were administered subject
to the limitations and with reference to the specific ends for
which they were organized, and their members recognized their
responsibility and dependence, I feel no anxiety nor apprehension
in leaving to the people of Ohio a "complete power" over their
government, and all the institutions and establishments it has
called into existence. My conclusion is, that the decree of the
circuit court of Ohio is erroneous, and that the judgment of this

BANK OF OIO, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, V. HENRY DEBOLT, LATE
TREASURER OF HAMILTON COUNTY.
The decision in the preceding case of Dodge v. Woolsey again affirmed.

Tins case was brought up from the supreme court of the State
of Ohio, by a writ of error, issued under the 25th section of the
judiciary act.
It originated in the court of common pleas in the county of
Hamilton and State of Ohio, and was an action brought by the
bank against Debolt, the nature of which is explained in the following agreed case.
The parties 'above named hereby agree upon the following
facts, upon which a controversy depends between them, and submit the case to the court of common pleas for determination and
judgment, in pursuance of section four hundred and ninety-five
of the code of civil procedure: It is agreed that the plaintiff is a duly authorized banking
company, under the hct passed by the general assembly of the
State of Ohio, on the 24th day of February, 1845, entitled, "An
Act to incorporate the State Bank of Ohio, and other banking
companies," which act is made a part of this case; that at the
foundation thereof, on the 30th day of June, 1845, it assumed
