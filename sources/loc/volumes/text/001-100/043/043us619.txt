It,
is impossible to lay down any general rule as to what con'stitutes multifariousness in a bill in equity. Every case must be governed by its own circumstances, and the court must exercise a sound discretion.
A bill filed against the executors of an estate and allthose who purchased from
them, is nbt, upon that account alone, multifarious.
Under the Louisiana law, the Court of Probate has exclusive jurisdiction in the
proof of wills; which includes those disposing of real as well as personal
estate.
In England, equity will not set aside a will for fraud and imposition, relief being
obtainable in other courts.
Although by the general law, as well as the local law of Louisiana, a will must
be proved before a title can be set up under it, yet a court of equity can so
far exercise jurisdiction as to compel defendants to answer, touching a will
alleged to be spoliated. And. it is a matter for grave consideration, whether
it cannot go further and set tip the lost will.
Where the heir at -law assails the validity of the will, by bringing his action
against the devisee or'legatee who sets up the will as his title, the District
'Courts of Louisiana are the proper tribunals, and the powers of a Court of
Chancery are necessary, in order to discover frauds which are 'within the
knowledge of the defendants.
Express trusts are abolished in Louisiana by tme law of that state, but that
implied trust, which is the creature of equity, has not been abr9gated.
The exercise of chancery jurisdiction by the Circuit Court of the United States,
sitting in Louisiana, does not introduce any new or foreign, principle. It is
only a change of the mode of redressing wrongs and protecting rights.

Tns case was a sequel to that which came before the court twice
before, and is reported in 13 Peters, 404, and 15 Peters, 9.
It came up again ftoin the Circuit Court of the United States for
the eastern district of Louisiana, sitting as a court of equity, on a
certificate of a division of opinion in that court; upon the three fol
lowing questions:

620

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

1. Is the bill multifarious? -and have the complainants a right to
sue the.defendants jointly in this case*?
2. Can the bourt entertain jurisdiction of this case without probate of the will set up by the complainants, and which they charge
to have been destroyed or suppressed ?
3. Has the court jurisdiction of this case? or does it belong exclusively to a court of law.
The case was this, as set forth by the complainant; the defendant
not yet having answered the bill.
It is stated with some particularity, because the counsel for the
complainants dwelt strongly upon the injustice that would follow if
such a case (supposed in the argument to be admitted by the demurrer)
should prove remediless-in a court of chancery. It is proper to
refer to the report of the argument of the counsel for the, defendants,
inwhich he affirmed that the important facts alleged to exist by the
complainant would be denied and disproved, if the court should be
of opinion that the cause should go on. Some of the circumstances
mentioned came out upon cross-examination.
In the year 1796, there was a French family by the name of Carriere,,residing iffNew Orleans. One of the daughters was named
Zuline, and about sixteen years of age. A person by the name of
De Grange, came there and married her; they, continued to five
together for several years, until about the year 1800, -when it was
reported that.De'Grange had another wife living. A separation took
place between him and Zuline. In '1802, she went to-New York
(where it was-said De Grange's former marriage had been celebrated)
to obtain proof of it; but the registry of marriages having been
destroyed, the proof was not obtained. She then went to Philadel'phia, where Mr. Gardette was living,-who- Was one of the witnesses
of the prior marriage, -and confirmed it. '"Whilst" she was there, she
had a daughter, to whom the name of Caroline wfs given, and who
is the same person spoken 'of in the proceedings in this suit, 'by the
name.of Caroline Barnep. Clark treated her as his child, and afterwards pla~ed her to live with his mother.
In 1803, De Grange'6 first wife, came from France to N6w Orleans,
and he' being there also, was, seized and -posecuted for bigamy.
He was arrested and thrown into prison, but effected his escape, and
never afterwards, returned. Clark was married to Zuline in Philadelphia%in the same y~ar, but required. the marriage to be kept secret

JANUARY TERM, ,1844.

until judicial proof could be obtained of the nullity of her marriage
with De Grange.
In 1805, Clark having returned to New Orleans and established
Zuline in a separate establishment from his own, the commercial firm
of Davis and Harper was formed, and rested almost entirely upon the
credit furnished by Clark. In 1806, Zuline was about to give birth to
another child, and, at the instance of Clark, arrangements were made
by Davis for its being received into his (Davis's) family. It pr~ved
to be a daughter, and was called Myra. She was suckled by Mrs.
Harper, wiho put out an infant of he own to enable her to do so.
Clark treated her as his daughter, furnished her with 'expensive
clothing and playthings, and purchased a servant for her use.
Shortly afterwards, Clark became a member of Congress, and was
absent from New Orleans for a considerable length of time. During
his absence, a report reached New Orleans, that he was about to contract a marriage at the north, and Zuline, whose feelings were fretted'
and irritated by his refusal-to promulgate their marriage, s0led for
Philadelphia, to obtain the legal proofs of her own marriage. When
she arrived there, she was told that the priest who had performed the
ceremony, was gone to Ireland. Being informed by counsel, whom
she consulted, that she would not be able to establish the validity
of her marriage, she determined to have no further communication
with Mr. Clark, and soon afterwards married Mr. Gardette, of Philadelphia.
Clark returned to New Orleans. In 1811, being about to visit
Philadelphia on a special emergency, he made a provisional will, as
follows:
I Daniel Clark. In the name of God: I, Daniel Clark, of New
Orleans, do make this my last will and testament.
Inprimis. I order that all my just debts be paid.
Second. I leave id -bequeath unto' my mother, Mary Clark, now
of Germantown, in the ptate of Pennsylvania, all the estate, whether
real or personal, -which I may die possessed of.
Third. I hereby nominate my friend, Rinhard Relf and Beverly
Chew, Amy executors, with power to settle'every thing relating to my
estate.

About the time of executing this will, he conveyed to Joseph
Belle-chasse about fifty lots in the city of New Orleans, in the suburbs
or fauxbourg St. ,John's, near the bayou of that name, in fee-simple,
with the confidential understanding that they were to remain under
his control 'for the use and benefit of his daughter Myra.
On the 27th of May, 1811, Clark, being so far upon his voyage,
wrote to his friend Mr. Davis, the following letter.
Dear Sir :-We are preparing to put to sea, and I hope I shall
have a pleasant passage, my stay will be but short in Philadelphia,
unless a forced one. In case of any misfortune to me, be pleased to.
deliver the enclosed to General Hampton; I count on him as a man
of honour to pay the amount of notes mentioned in my letter to him,
which in that case you will dispose of as I have'directed. It will
naturally strike you that the letter to the general is to be delivered
only in case of misfortune to me, rem amber me kindly to Mrs. Davis

P. S. Of the enclosed letter you will say

accident, when you may communicate it to Chew and Relf.
S. 13. Davis.
The direction alluded to in the above, was to place the amount of
the notes to the best advantage for his daughter Myra's interest.
Having arrived safely at Philadelphia and remained there until July,
he addressed the following letter to Mr. Davis, on the eve of his sailing
for New Orleans, on his return.
Philadelphia,12th July, 1811.
My dear Sir :-In case of any accident or misfortune to me, be
pleased to open the letter addressed to me, which accompanies this,
and act with respect to the enclosures as I directed you with respect
to the other affairs committed to your charge before .leaving New
Orleans. To account in a satisfacto~,y manner to the person committed to your honour, will, I flatter mys-lf, be done by you when she
is able to manage her own afflairs; until when, I commit her under
*God to your'protection. I expect to sail to-morrow for New Orleans
in the ship Ohio, and do not wish to risk these papers at sea.

Upon Clark's safe arrival in New Orleans, Davis returned to him
the package enclosed in the above letter, aid also the letter addressed
to General Hampton in the letter which he had written from the.
Balize.
Upon Clark's return, Bellechasse also offered t6 reconvey the lots,
which Clark declined, and Bellechasse continued to hold them until Clark's death, when he conveyed them in equal portions to Myra
and Caroline,,being influenced to include the latter by the representations of some of Clark's friends.
In 1812, Davis removed to the north with his Exaily, carrying
with him Myra, who passed .for his daughter, and bore his name.
He had then in his hands funds of Clark to the amount of $2,360,
the interest of which, by arrangement between .them, was to be applied towards her educr don.
In 1813, Clark died. It was alleged,.that before his death he
made an olographic will, leaving the bulk of his fortune to his
daughter Myra. The circumstances under which he is represented
to have made it, are thus detailed by some of the witnesses.
Dusuau de la Croix says, "that he was very intimate with the
late Daniel Clark for a great many years, and up to the time of his
death; that somt. few months previous to-the death of Daniel Clark,
he visited deponent on his plantation, and expressed a wish that he,
deponent, should become his executor; deponent at first refused, but
after a litt, from the persuasion of said Clark, he consented to become his executor; that in this conversation, Clark spoke of a
young female then in the family of Captain Davis, named Myra, that
said Clark expressed a wish that deponent should become tutor to
this female, and that she should be sent to France for her education,
and that Mr. Clark would leave her a sufficient fortune to do away
with the stain of her birth; that a month or two after this conversation at the plantation of deponent, he, deponent, called to see Clark
at his house on the Bayou road, he there found him in his cabinet,
and had just-sealed up a packet, the superscription of which was as
follows: 'pQur etre ouvert en cas de mort.' Clark threw it down
in the presence of deponent, and told him that it contained his last
will and some other papers which would be of service ; deponent
did not see the will, nor does he know any thing about its contents,
he only saw the packet with the superscription on it as before related."

Bellechasse says: "'A very short time before the sickness that
ended in his death, he, Clark, conversed with us about his said
daughter Myra in the paternal and affectionate terms as theretofore.
He told us that he had completed and finished his last will. He,
Clark, therefore, took from a small black case his said last will, and
gave it open to me and Judgq Pitot to look at and 6xamine. It was
wholly written in the handwriting of said Daniel Clark, and it was
'dated and signed by the said Clark in his own handwriting. Pitot,
de ]a Croix, and myself were the executors named in it, and in it the
said Myra was declared to be his legitimate daughter, and the heiress
of all his estate. Some short time afterwards I called to see him,
Clark, and learned from said Reif that the said Clark was sidk ik
bed, too sick to be seen by me; however I, indignant at an attempt
to prevent me fr6m seeing my friend, pressed forward into his room.
He, said Clark, took him by the hand, and with affectionate reprehension said, ' How is it, Bellechasse, that you have not come to
see me before since my sickness? I told Relf to send for you.' My
answer was, that I had rec'eived no such -message or account whatever of his sickness from Relf. I said further, ' My friend, you know
that on various occasions I have been your. physician, and on this
occasion I wish to be so again.' He lboked at me and squeezed my
hand. Fearful of oppressing him, I retired, and told Relf that I
would remain to"attend occasionally to Clark. Relf said there was
no occasion for it, that the doctor or doctors had ordered that he,
Clark, should be kept as quiet. as possible, and not be allowed to
talk: I expressed apprehension for the situation of Clark, but Relf
expressed a diffient opinion; and on his, Relf, promising to send
for me if there should appear to be any danger, I departed. On the
next day, without receiving any message from Reif, I went and found
Clark dead."
Mrs. Harper. (afterwards Mrs., Smyth) says: "In 181.3, some few
months. before Mr. Clark's death, he told me he felt he ought no
longr todefer securing his estate to his daughter Myra by a last will.
"INear this period, he stopped one day at my house, and said to me
he was on his way to the plantation of Chevalier de lh Croix, for
the purpose of requ'esting him to be named in his will one of his
executors, and futor t6 his daughter Myra. On his. return, he told
me wiah much apparent gratification that De la Croix had consented
to serve, and that Judge Pitot and Col. Belleehasse had consented to

be the other executors. About this time he told me he had commenced making his last will. Between this period and the time he
br6ught his last will to my house, Mr. Clark spoke very often of
being enga~gd in making his last will; he always spoke of it in connection with his only and beloved daughter Myra; said he was
making -it for her sake, to make her his sole heiress, and to insure
her being educated according to his wishes. At the times Mr. Clark
spoke of being engaged in making his last will, he told ihe over and
over again, what would constitute its contents; that he should in it
acknowledge the said Myra as his legitimate.aughter, and bequeath
all his estate to her, but direct that.. an annuity of $2000 a year
should be paid his mother during her life, and an annuity of $500 a
year to a young female.at the north of the United States, named
Caroline De Grange, till her majority; then it was to cease, and
$5000 dollars were to be paid -her as a legacy, and that he would
direct that one year after the settlement of his estate $5000 should
be paid to a son of Judge Pitot, of New Orleans, as a legacy; at the
same peripd $5000 as a legacy to a son of. Mr. Du Buys, of New
Orleans; that.his slave Lubin was to be freed, and a maintenance
provided for him. In his conversations respecting his being engaged
in making his last will, he talked a good deal about the plan of education to be laid down in his will for his daughter Myra; he expressed
frequently his satisfaction that the Chevalier de la Croix would be
the tutor in his will; he often spoke with earnestness of" the moral
benefit to his daughter Myra from being acknowledged by him in his
last will as his-legitimate daughter, and he often spoke of the happiness it would give his mother; he expressed the most extravagant
pride and ambition for her, he would frequently use the emphatic
lnguage, that he was making her a bill of rights; he mentioned at
these times, that this would contain a complete inventory of all his
estate, and explanations of"all his business, so as both to render the
.administration on his estate- plain and easy to his friends, Chevalier
de ]a Croix, Judge Pitot, and Col. Bellechasse, and as a safeguard
to. his estate, in case he should not live long enough to dissolve and
adjpst all -his pecuniary relations with others. About four weeks
before his death, Mr. Clark brought this will to my house; as he
came in, he said, 'Now my will is finished.' my estate is secured to
Myra beyond human contingency, ' now if I die to-morrow, she will
go forth to society, to my relations, to my mother, acknowledged by

me, in my last will, as my legitimate daughter, and will be educated
according to my minutest wishes, under the superintendence of the
Chevalier de la Croix, and her interests will be under the care of Chevalier .de la Croix, Judge Pitot, and Col. Beilechasse; here is the
charter of her 'rights, it is now completely finished, and I have
brought it to you to read ;' he left it in my possession until the next
day, I read it deliberately from beginning to end. In this will, Mr.,
Clark acknowledged Myra Clark as'his legitimate daughter and only
heir, designating her as then living in the family of S. B. Davis;
Mfr. Clark in this will bequeatbed allihis estate to the said Myra, but
directed that an annuity of $2000 should be paid to his mother
during her (his mother's) life, and an annuity of $500 should be paid
to Caroline De Grange, till she arrived at majority, when the annuity
was to cease, and $5000 were to be paid her as a legacy. He di.rected that one year after his estate was settled, $5000 should be
paid as a legacy to a son of Judge Pilot, of New Orleans; and that
one year after his estate was settled $5000 should be paid as a legacy
to a son of Mr. Du Buys, of New Orleans; he provided for the freedom and maintenance of his slave Lubin; he appointed Mr. Dusuau
de la Croix tutor to his daughter Myra; he gave very extensive instructions in regard to her education; this will contained an inventory of his estate, and explanations of his business relations; he
appointed Mr. Dusuau de la Croix, James Pitot, and D. D. Bel-'
lechasse, executors; the whole of this will was in Mr. Clark's handwriting; it was dated in July, 1813, and was signed by him; it was
an olographic will; it was dated in July, 1813, and was signed by
him; I was well acquainted with said Clark's handwriting. The
last time Mr. Clark spoke to me about his daughter and his last will,
was on the day he came out for the last time (as far as I know) from
his house, which was the lasi time I saw him; he came to my house
at noon, complained of feeling unwell, asked leave to have prepared
fof him a bowl of tea; he made his visit of about two hours' duration,
talking the whole time of his daughter Myra, and his last will; he
said a burden of solicitude was removed from his mind from the
time he had secured to her his estate beyond accident, by'finisbing
his last will; he dwelt upon the moral benefit to her in society from
being acknowledged by him in his last will as his legitimate daughter; he talked about .her education, said it would -be the gteatest
boon-from his God to live to bring her up, but what was next to

that were his comprehensive instructions in his will in regard to her
education, anal her being committed to the care of the Chevalier de
la Croix, who would be a parent to her.
After Clark's death, the will of 1811 was presented to the Court
of Probate, and proved ; letters testamentary were issued to the
executors; a power of attorney was given to them by Mr. Clark's
mother, and various pieces of property were sold Under'it and under
the will.
In"1832, Myra married William Wallace Whitney, and about the
time of her marriage became acquainted with her true name and
parentage; and in 1836 filed a joint bill, with her husband, in the
Circuit Court of the* United St; tes for the district of Louisiana
against Relf and Clhew, the-execators in the will cf 1811, the heirs
of Mary Clark, and all the purchasers and occupants of the estate of
.which Clark died in possession, claiming to be the heir and devisee
of Clark, and calling upon them all to account for the rents and
profits of the several portions of the estate. The bill charged that
the will of 1813 was fraudulently. suppressed, that its existence and
suppression were notorious, and that all the purchasers-did, in theirconsciences; believe that the will of 1811 had been fraudulently
admitted to probate. In addition to the prayer for an account, it
prayed for general relief.
In the progress of the suit, Whitney having died, Edmund P.
Gaines, sorhetime afterwards,'married the widow and became a party
to the suit.
The defendants all demurred, but filed separate demurrers.
Barnes and wife demurred upon six grounds:
1. The want of equity in the bill.
2: That there existed a complete remedy at law.
3. Multifariousness and misjoinder.
4. That the will of 1813 was not probated.
5. That forced heirship gave title to but one-third, which was
recoverable at law.
6: That the New Orleans and Carrollton Rail-road Company,
with whom they were conjoined, was not shown to be a corporation.
'Chew and Relf demurred generally, and also pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court.
Upon the argument of the demurrers, the three questions arose
which are mentioned at the commencement of this statement, and

ject for consideration by this court.

These questions were the sub-

Henderson, Coxe, and Barton (leave having been obtained for three
counsel to address the court on the same side) for the defendants
below, who had demurred.
. Johnson and Jones, for Gaines and wife.
Henderson.
As to the 1st point. Is the bill multifarious? If the interests of
the defendants are distinct, it is unlawful to make them join in the
defence.
[The counsel here examined their relative interests.]
2. Can the court entertain jurisdiction without a probate of the
will ?
Some of the parties are aliens, living in England and Ireland.
How can they be brought into court? Yet they must be, because
they are all interested in the will of 1811. The. equity power of this
court is limited by the Constitution and Judiciary act to the usual
powers of the English chancery; but it cannot possess all those
powers, because our institutions are different. If the chancery
power of England could not reach a state court, this cannot. Its
powers must be uniform. If a state strips its courts of jurisdiction
over mortgages, for example,.this court must part with the power
too. 4 Wheat., 115, 180.
Local laws cannot confer jurisdiction on the courts of the United
States. 11 Peters, 184. The states may prescribe rules of proceeding, but not jurisdiction. 9 Peters, 632; 13 Peters, 259. The
powers of this court cannot exceed or even come up to those of the
English chancery. In England there is a distinction in chhncery
between real and personal property. It will entertain a bill to
esiablish a will, when repeated decisions have been made about it,
which is.called a bill of peace. But the chancellor does not decide
a will without referring it to a jury. This is the measure of the
power of this court; it cannot go further. But cdin it go this far?
The probate courts of Louisiana have the exclusive power of establishing wills as to personal property. Why not real also? In
England the probate courts have not the power, and,, therefore, the
chancellor comes in. The decision of a probate court is final as to

JANUARY TERM, 1844.

real as -well as personal estate. 2 Vernon, 9, 76, 441; 2 Atkyns,
324, 334.
The court cannot set aside a -will by decree. In this case, the
court must clash with the Probate Court, because it must revoke the
probate of the will of 1811, before'that of 1813 can be established.
The prayer of the bill here is to carry into effect the will of 1813, to
do which, this -court must first take probate of. it, and then execute
its provisions. No case in the books goes as far as this.
While a probate stands; it is not examinable in chancery. 2 Vernon, 9.
Where personal estate is concerned, chancery declines to interfere.

A probate is conclusive until repealed. 1 Strange, 670,673, 408;

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

Coxe, on the same side.
The bill is unshilfully prepared. When demurred to, such a bill
is often decided upon grounds which do not appear i.. the record.
There are two grounds in this case.
1. The jurisdiction of the court.
2. The multifariousness of the bill.
Myra claims to be the legitimate daughter and heir of Clark, and
also under a will of 1813; and the bill is filed not only against the
executors, but every one who is in possession of any part of the
estate. But there is no allegation in the bill that any part of the real
estate passed to the- holders under the will of 1811. It is said that
Clark died seised ; but is silent whether this property was assets in
the hands of the executors or not. It alleges that the executors conveyed the land, under a power of attorney, from Clark's mother. If
the bill be true, then the possessors are merely tort-feisors, and this
is not the remedy against them. All the English cases are those of
devisees against heirs-the heir-at-law has a remedy at law. But
the complainant here is undei peculiar difficulties on account of state
legislation. The tendency in this country is to assimilate real with
personal property, and in -ten states, courts of probate have jurisdiction over both species. These states have power over real estate,
and over the jurisdiction of their courts. In Louisiana all trusts are
abrogated. A cestui que trust cannot set up a title. Can this court
say that any one shall hold land in trust there? Suppose that a
devise of rear estate were forbidden; could this court recognise it?
In Louisiana, a probate is essential, and the courts which have
charge of it have .the same jurisdiction as a Court of Chancery in
England. This court can neither revoke nor set up a will. If an
executor sell property under a proved will, the title of the purchaser
cannot be impeached, although the will be afterwards set aside for
fraud. How*can .the Circuit Court in Louisiana revoke a proved
will, when the English Court of Chancery will not? If the Court
of Probate compels the executors to go on, the Circuit Court cannot
grant an injunction to stop a state court from proceeding. The
decree would therefore be impotent. Chancery will act upon the
person, and compel the surrender of a papei, or the entry of satisfaction upon a fraudulent judgment; but in this case it would have to
act upon a court.
The bill also prays that the declarations of Clark as to the legiti-

macy of the complainant may be established. ]Under what branch of
power is this, and how caa the court examine such a point? It also
prays that all the sales made by the executors maybe set aside. Butif
any of these were made by order of a court, can they be set aside also ?
R. .ohnson, for Gaines and wife, complainants.
Is the bill multifarious ?. The demurrer admits the heiiship, the
will of 1813, the charge that it was placed in the hands of two of
the defendants, that they fraudulently destroyed it, and set up the
will of 1811 ; admits also that the existence of the will of 1813 was
notorioug, and the heirship of the complainant equally so. The argument admits all this, and asks the court to turn away the complainant,
because parties are made defendants who ought not to be., The rule
is within the sound discretion of the court, and designed to protect 7
the innocent. But if the facts alleged in the bill be tiue , (and the
argument admits them,) it will be here made the means of shielding
the guilty. In this case, we need not invoke the discretion of the
court, because, according to the authorities, the bill is not multifarious
either as to the interests involved, or the parties.
The complainant claims as heir and devisee of the whole estate,
and theobject is, to have the title to the whole decreed to-be valid.
The parties are the original parties to the fraud and their confederates,
taking with notice of the fraud. The defendants all deny the title of
the complainant, and have, therefore, a common object. The rule
of chancery is that multiplicity of litigation is to be avoided; but if
we were to establish the will in a suit against one, it would be good
only as to that one, and each of the defendants would have to be'.
separately sued. This is not the spirit of the rule. Whoever has an.
interest to be bound, must be made a-party. Milford's Pleading, 181,
182; 1 Atkyns, 282; 1 Mylne and Craig, 603, 616. In Mylne and Craig it was said to be impossible to lay down an
abstract proposition, as to what should constitute multifariousness.
See also, 3 Price, 164; 2 Peters, 417; 4 Peters, 190.
If it be said that our remedy is at law, it is ad~iitting that we have
a case. But equity will maintain a conpurrent jurisdiction where
there isfraud, because it can sift the conscience and compel the,delivery of papers. If there is a fraudulent deed, equity strikes it down,
never to rise again. If we had gone to law and'recovered the estate,
complete justice would not have been done, because the will of 1811 ;

632

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

would have remained standing to defraud the living and injure the
memory of the dead. Full and final relief is only fo be had in
chancery.
If we had a probate of the will of 1813, it is admitted that
we
could be relieved, and the question is, whether chancery, in England,
could relieve without going through the forms of probate. Suppose
the court in Louisiana has exclusive jurisdiction of probates, still the
question is; whether the bill shows a case proper, for the Circuit
Court. The demurrer admits that th6 will of 1813 has disappeared
by the-fraudulent cotduct of the defendants, or that it remains in
their possession and they refusje to produce it. Is there nothing here
upon which the chancery power of this court can act? The Probate
Court of Louisiiina has no power commensurate with the case. Its
jurisdiction is given by statute. What is it?
It cdn take probate of wills in the manner directed, but the case
of a s ippressed will is not provided far.
The power is gontained in Code of Practice, art. 924; but 925
says, it has no jurisdiction- except in cases enumerated in the preceding article. There-is authority given to open, receive, and record
a will; but 'ibne to bring it out hen suppressed. See articles 928,
930, 931; 93 , 935, 936, 937.- By 937, if the notary or other lerson refuse to -produce it, he shall be arrested, and if he can give no
good reason, shall be committed to prison and respond in damages.
But a remedy in damages is utterly insuffcient in this case. We
want the land and property. It is said that a copy can be evidence;
but the civil couirt only makes evidence copies of such papers as are
already recorded. The question before the court is, whether we can
get on without a probate, which we cannot obtain; for the demurrer admits that the will is either suppressed or destroyed. We
vant the only evidence which Vill enable us to obtain relief; the
probate of the will of 1811 would be no obstacle. It must be
shown, by the other side, that jurisdiction over the case is vested
exclusively in some other court. But in England the case of a
spoliated will falls within chancery powers. Lord Hardwicke said,
in the case cited from 3 Atkyns, that he would, in such a case, hold
an executor trustee for the dev isee. 3 Atkyns, 359

These cases establish two propositions,
1. That a probate in England, obtained by fraiid, will be relieved
against in chancery.
2. That a probate for personalty and realty, obtained by fraud,
wil make the party a trustee for the person interested, leaving the
probate to stand, provided the fraud be perpetrated by spoliation or
destruction of papers.
The on.y two exceptions are, where part of the will is fraudulent
and part not, and where there is a fraudulent ageement between the
heir and devisee. But if spoliation be proved upon the person who
sets up the will, chancery will interfere.
The Constitution of the United States,'and the-Judiciary act.of 1789,
and the Process act of 1792, give to the federal courts, jurisdiction
in all cases of law or equity. All that we have to do is to show that.
this is a case of equity..
Constitution of the United States, art. 3, see. 2; Judiciary act,
sec. 11; it is a matter of right for all persons who have a case of
equity to go into the courts of the United States and ask relief,
4 Wheat. 108; 3 Peters, 433; 3 Wheat. 2h2; 9 Peters, 655; 13 Peter',
358; 15 Peters, 9, 13. In the last case'the same objection was made
that has now been made, but the court decided against it.
It is asked how we are to reach the .Court of Probate. The answer
"is found in the Constitution of the United States. If it is a case, &c.,
all state.power falls. -It was intended to protect the people from state
prejudice; the framers of the instrument knew that local prejudices
would exist, and saved the people from their operation. Another
answer is, that the Chancery Court acts upon persons, passing by
state tribunals. If they interfere, the twenly-fifth section of the Judiciary act meets the case.
It is objected that our argument destroys all siate regulations, but
this begs the question. We say that Louisiana has recognised the
right to transfer property by will, and this -right was exercised in the
present case. Besides, state- power cannot limit the Constitution of
the United States and the jurisdiction of this couit under it. The
bill was filed in 1836. It took the defendants five sears to find out
that the bill did not inake a case, and to file their demurrer.

not charged to have derived their titles from the will. The printed
abstract does-not say so, it. is true, but the record itself does. The
bill charges, that-they claim -under colour of title from pretended
executors, referring directly to the will.
The next objection is on account of the aliens, living in England
and Ireland. But we have, done. all 'that we can as regards them.
The .court cannot lose jurisdiction because some of the parties reside
abioad.
Is the bill multifaribus?
It is the nature of equity to bring in all parties who, have an interest. It is said in the books that claims must not be joined together
when they are different,- nor parties who ihave not an entire interest.
But it is esteemed a virtue in equity that all proper parties are brought
in. Thus in the case of a fishery; all came in, although their rights
were separate. A demurrer will not hold, if the plaintiff claims under
a general right. Mitford's Pleading, 181, 182.
If we were 't6 'ue separately, we should have to prove the same
thing im every case, and a multiplicity of action is not favoured by
equity.
As to the jurisdiction 'of the court.
It is said that a state court here claims exclusive jurisdiction. If
a state can say that its courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction, it can,
by extending the range of subjects, shut out the courts of the United
States from all jurisdiction whatever., -The bnly question is, is it a
case of-equity ? If so, no matter how fat the claim of exclusiveness
of jurisdiction in the state -courts may be pressed, the Constitution of
the United States comes iri with paramount authority. The opposite
counsel.have confounded the two questions of the exclusiveness of
state jurisdiction and theconclusiveness of a final judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. We agree that the judgment of such a
court is concluuive upon all co-ordinate courts, until regularly reversed
by an appellate court ' But here we do not impeach any such judgment, By the law of Louisiana, a will of real estate has the same
effect that a will, of personalty has in England. We admit this.
And we admit, too, that a probate is necessary to vest a title to real
estate, as much so as recording a deed is, to give it validity. If our
claimi would be good against a proved will in England, it is goqd
here. The Code of Louisiana is made up of the civil law and Napoleon- Code. But what power has a probate court to provc a will

6 Har. and Johns. 67.
The case in 11 Louisiana Rep. 693, is thought by the other side,
tor sustain the position that the Court of Probate zould prove -a wil"
although it.was not produced; but the case does not say so.
But it is argued that the will of 1811 must be set aside before that
of 1813 can be set up, and that the Circuit-Court cannot do this.
Why not? It has as much right to do it:as the Probate Court; not
as an appellate tribunal, reviewing the decision of that court, but in
Ihe exercise of a separate jurisdiction. The will of 1811 may stand
among the records, but-its'effeetwill be destroyed. So it is-in Eng-:
land with spoliated deeds. Equity constantly set6 aside law inStruments when an equitable title is asserted.
What other remedy have we? We cannot go to the Probate Court
and ask them to set up the will of 1813. They .cnnot do it. And
even if they could, that would-not debar us of this remedy. Code
ofPractice, 604 to 613; 3 Martin, 518; 5 Louis. Rep. 393.
If a state court had jurisdiction and the remedy is imperfect, a
party must not be driven there. The Probate Court is shackled, and
limited to matters of administration. It may compel an-administrator
to~settle, but cannot direct a suit against thid-persons, and cannot
give us the property in dispute. 1 Louis. Rep. 183; 3 Louis.
Rep. 520.

it is said that a probate court is the only tribunal that can set aside
a will. But we deny -this. 10 Mattin, 1; 1 Martin, N. S. 577;

As to equity jurisdiction. It is a general principle that courts of:
equity have jurisdiction over all cases of fraud. Although 'courts of
law have it, equity does not lose it. There are t o-exceptions recognised in the books, but neither of them includes this case. Gene'
rally, the heir need not go into chancery,- because the title is cast
upon him by descent ; but where there is a devisee who thus appears
to have the legal title, the heir cannot resoit to a court of law, but
must apply to equity. 13 Price, '721.

Barton, for the defendants, being demurrents,-in reply and confchision.
The facts in the case, although nominally admitted by the'demur-

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

rer for the sake of argument, are not. in reality admitted. Some of
the worthiest' citizens of Louisiana are denounced in the bill, as perpetrating atrocious frauds. If this court shall require them to answer
-the bill, they will deny. all thn important facts charged in it. T,'-y
years have elapsed since the transactions took place; and at the last
term, this court-refused to open a case after twenty ydars had expired.
This is called a bill of peace. It is not like bne. The heirs of Mary
Clark sold the land and received the money thirty, years ago; and
yet those heirs are not made parties so that a cross-bill could be filed
against them.
[Mr. Barton here referred to a high opinion of Clark which had
been expressed in the course of the argument, in which he concurred.]
The will of 1"11 gave the whole estate to his' mother. Where
was his wife, if he had one?
So the will of 1813,is said to have 'given his wife nothing, in violation of all duties. The bill itself th~refore, attacks his character.
It says also that the complainant was kept in.ignorance of her true
name until she was nineteen years of age. Her own mother is alleged
not to have told her, and yet this mother is said to have been the
wife of Clark.
Is the bill multifarious ?
Story's Equity Pleadings, sect. 271 to 279, ha numerous references oi this point. See also 1 Jacob, 151; 1 Maddock?s Rep. 86 ;
2 Maddock's Rep. 294; 6 Maddock's Rep. 94; 18 Ves. 50; 2 Yes.

65; 6 Dana, 186; 6 Johns. Chan. Rep. 163; Halsted's Dig. 168;
5 Cowen, 86.
. The bill is hot only multifarious as to parties and subject-matters,
but also as to-jurisdictions. Suppose the will of 1813 were-actually,
probated and the plaintiff claimed under it, would this court act
upon such a question, or Would they not rather send it to a court of
law-to be tried?
The plaintiff confounds rights even in herself..
If the -claim of legitimacy be established and the will of 1811
should remain, the testdtor by the old code could dispose of one-fifth
of his estate away fron.his child. (Old Civil Code, p. 212, art. 19,
chap. 3.) Mary Clark would, therefore have one-fifth, and her heirs
ought to-be parties; And-besides, if the legitimacy be established,

the mother of the comnlalnant must of course have been the v'ife of
the testator, and as such, entitled to halr of the estate, of ivhich he
could not deprive her. New Civil Code, art. 148; Old Civil Code,
p. 336, art. 63 to 69. Aid yet the alleged wife is not a paity.
So if the will-of 1813 be -set up; and the legitimacy proven, the
wife will have half, and 'yet she is not made a party, although ever.
one knows that she is living. The executors of the will of 1813 are
said to have been Bellechasse and Pigat, the latter one of the-judges
of the Court of Probate. The commission-is two and a half per tent.
for executors. Did not Pigot'know how to 'get the will, if there was
48
one? New Civil Code, 2369 to '2376; Old Civil Code, p. 2W,
art. 179.
There is a mulfifari6usness as to things.
The bill embraces twenty-,six'pieces of land, and it is not said who
owns all these. And s5 of the slaves; ninety-three are allotted amongstdifferent owners, whilst one hundred and thirty-three-are iot accounted
for. An interest in the mere question is not sufficient to authorize all
these persons. to be-joined in one bill; theymust all have an interest
in the subject-matter. Persons, are also made "parties.who are said
to be in the occupancy. of a square of ground. What interest have
they, if they are mere occupants? If their testimony would be
admissible as impartial persons, they ought not to be parties.
An insuperable difficulty will be found if any of these sales of real
estate have been made under a warranty. By the Louisiana law, in
such a case, the warrantor may be summoned in at.once-to defend
the title; and if he is not, the warrantee loses his remedy.against him.
But'under the present process,'this cannot be done,, and the benefit
of our wise law is lost. Our system has been called a mongrel sys.
tem, but it is good enough for us. It does iot follow that-lawg are
unjust because they emanate from a despotic government. The
Napoleon Code was not destroyed by the Bourbons; The practice
in. Louisiana is .a .complete equity; either party may arrive at, the
knowledge of -facts in the possession of the other with- more simplicity tha the English chancery process. The district-attorney of'the
United States has preferred resorting to the state tribunals. in a cii-'
troversy between the government and Bank of the United States;
rather than go into the fedeiral court. To a case like .the present,
our system is peculiarly applicable. But in the proposed mode, you
are deciding here the interests of a vast number of persons not seen
at all.

628

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ur. v. Chew et al.

The position that a state cannot enlarge or restrain the equity power
of the Circuit Court of the United States, is laid down too broadly.
The parliament of England might have placed the probate and jurisdiction over wills of real and personal estate exclusively in the ecclesiastical courts; and if so, why cannot Louisiana do the same thing?
The sovereignty of a state over its domestic policy is complete, and
especially over its land laws. The clause in the Constitution was
inserted, undoubtedly, for the security of impartial justice, but justice
administered with uniformity by state and federal tribunals. Both
were intended to be guided by the same rules. If they adopt different ones, you may obtain impartiality, but where is the uniformity.
There is another case upon the docket of this court by the complainants, in which they have prosecuted their claim singly against
Patterson. If they-can maintain a suit against-one of these numerous
parties by himself, it shows that their interests must be distinct.
It is important to keep in view the distinction between overthrowing a proved will and setting up another one. The will of 1811 is
not said to be defective or irregular, but it is the probate which is
objected to, and that is the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. Until appealed from, it is as binding as a decree of this court.
Story's Equity Pleadings, sect. 511; 2 Roper on Legacies, 532.
In 3 Merivale, 161, the. Master of the Rolls says, cit is no question whether a chancery court can set up a will." If an English
courit can overthrow the dictum of Lord Hardwicke 100 years ago,
cannot the legislature of a free state do it?
Probate courts have exclusive jurisdiction over wills, and no other
court can interfere, by thp laws of Massachusetts. 4 Mason's Rep.

In 17 Louis. Rep. 14-16, it was held that where an action
was brought in the District Court against one in possession and claiming under a will, if the will was set up, it might be inquired into.
But that is not the present case, because it is not averred that Mary
Clark's heirs are in possession.
The. claim to set up the will of 1813 is attempted to be sustained
by being made analogous to the case of a spoliated will in England,
and the case in 1 Yes. jun. 286, relied on with great confidence,
but it does not apply to the Circuit Court of the United States. There

is no case which has been cited, in which-the chancellor acted upon
any other person than the wrong-doer himself. But here the execi'tors are functus officio, and third persons, purchasersiare par ies. Can
they b6 imprisoned for nbt producing the will of 1813 ? and if Reif
should be imprisoned, how can-that affect the title of the city of
New Orleans to property which it has held for -twenty-five years. 'It
has been said that a party can be decreed to be a trustee for the benefit of the person reilly interested. But before you can do this, you
must repeal the statute oF Louisiana, abolishing all trusts. They
were abolished, by the Code of 1808, and again by the Code of' 1825.
Civil Code (new) 1506, 1557.
.
Can this court fasten upon the people of Louisiana all the doctrine
of uses and trusts, against their positive law? Suppose the purchasers are decreed to stand seised to the use of the complainant:
you will have created fifty or sixty trusts. -And when one of these
trustees dies, or makes a cessio bonorum, what will be ddne? Will
you sell an estate, the title to which is in one person, and the use in
another? But the law of Louisiana positively prohibits this.
A power to compel a man to go before the court and resign his probate, is, in effect, 'arevocation of the judgment itself and an overthrow of the court. But the decision of that court can never be inquired into by another tribunal. 1 Pickering, 547. And the Probate Courts of Louisiana have as' exclusive a-jurisdiction as those ofMassachusetts. The English cases are not applicable. 3 Porter, Al.
Rep. 52, 58; 4 Missouri Rep. 210.
It is said by the other side that the Probate Courts of Louisiana
are different from other OQiphans' Courts. It is not so but suppose it
was. How can a ciiien of another state claim more rights than a
citizen of the state itself. The Constitution requires all to be placed
upon an equal footing, but nothing more. In fact, the Louisiana
Courts of Probate have more power than similar courts in Massachusetts. For these propositions, see Code of Practice, 324; 1 Story's

1581 treats of an ologtaphic will,.i. e. written, dated, and signed,

observed the will is null and void.
Civil Code, (old) art. 160, contains the same provisions. The
date here is important, for if a vill -was written at all, it might have
been before 1811, and therefore revoked by it.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This case is brought before the.court from the eastern district of
Louisiana, by a division of the judges on certain points, which are
certified under the act of Congress.
The complainants in their bill state that Daniel Clark, late of the
city'of New Orleans, in the state. of Louisiana, in -the year 1813
died, seised in fee-simple, or otherwise well entitled to and lawfully
possessed of, in the district aforesaid, a large estate, real and personal,
consisting of plantations, slaves, debts due, and other property, all
of which'is described in thebill.
That'the said Myra was the only legitimate child of the said Clark.
That about the month of July, 1813, he made his last will and testament,..according to law, and in which he devised to his daughter
Myra all his estate, real and-personal, except certain bequests named.
Col. Joseph Deville, Degontlne Bellachasse, James Pitot, and Chevalier Dtisuau de la Croix were appointed, executors of.the will, and
the said, Chevalier, de la Croix was also appointed tutor to the
said Myra, who. was then about seven yearsof age. In a few days
after making'the will the said Clark died.
From her birth, .the said Myra was placedj by her father, in the
family of Samuel B.. Davis, who at the time resided in New Orleans,
but in 1812 removed to Philadelphia,-where the said Myra resided
until her first marriage, being ignorant of her rights and her parentage.
In the year 1811, being about to make a journey to Philadelphia,
and fearing some embarrassments from a partnership transaction, the
said Clark conveyed property tQ the said Samuel B. Davis and others,
to the amount of:several hundred thousand'.dollars to be held in trust
for' the use of-the'sai4 Myra. And about the same time he' made a
will devising to his,.mother, then residing out of Louisiana, his pro:.
perty, and appointed Richard Relf and Beverley Chew, two of the
defendants, his exeuutor.
That afterwards, on his return: frbm
Philadelphia, le received back a portion of the property conveyed in
trust as aforesaid; apd by the will of 1813 revoked that of 18!1.

Gaines et ux. v. Chew e-tal.

The bill charges that immediately upon the death of the said Clark,
the will of 1813 bame into the possession of the - said Relf, who
fraudulently concealed, suppressed, or destroyed the same, and did
substiffte in*its place the revoked will of 1811 ; that the will of
1813 was never afterwards seen except by the said Reif and Chew,
and their confederates.
It is further charged that the said Relf. fraudulently set up the revoked will of 1811, and obtained probate of the same; that he; with.
the said Chew, being sworn as executors, fraudulently took possession of the real and personal estate of the deceased, and also his'title
papers and books. That they appropriated to their own use large
sums of mohey and a large amount-of property of 'the estate, and in
combination with the defendants named, who cc had some knowledge,
notice, information, belief or suspicion, or reason for belief or suspicion and did believe," so that the said Relf and Chew had' acted
fraudulently in setting up and proving the will of 1811. And the
complainants pray that effect may be given to the will of 1813, and.
that the will of 1811 may be revoked; and that the defendants may
be decreed to deliver up possession of the lands purchased as afore,
said, and account for the rents, &c.; and that the executors may be
decreed to account The complainants- also represent tht 'the said
Myra is the only heir-at-law of the said Clark; and that his property
descended to her, &c. In addition to the-special relief asked; the
complainants pray for csuch other and further relief in the premises,
as the nature of the case may require."
To the bill, several of the defendants fded.a special demurrer. On
the argument of the demurrer, -the opinins of the judges were op.
posed on the following points.
1. Is the bill multifarious? and have the complainants a right to
sue the defendants jointly in this case.
2. Can the court entertain jurisdiction of this case, without probate
of the will set up by the complainants, and which they charge to
have been destroyed or suppressed.
3. Has the court jurisdiction of this case, or does it belong exclusively to a court of law. The demurrer is not before the court, but
the points 'certified.
In considering these points, all the facts
stated in the bill are admitted.
Whether the bill be multifarious or not is the first inquiry.

perty real and personal, by purchase or otherwise, which belonged to
Daniel Clark at the time of his death. That a bill which is multifarious may be demurred to for that cause is a general principle; but
what shall constitute multifariousness is a matter about which there
is a great diversity of opinion. In general terms a bill is said to be
multifarious, which seeks to enforce against different individuals, demands which are wholly disconnected. In illustration of this, it is
said, if an estate be sold in lots to different persons, the purchasers
could not join in exhibiting one bill-against the vendor for a specific
performance. Nor could the vendor file a bill for a specific performance against all the purchasers. The contracts of purchase being
distinct, in no way connected with each other, a bill for a specific
execution, whether filed by the vendor or vendees, must be limited
to one contract. It has been decided that an author cannot file a
joint bill against several booksellers for .selling the same spurious edition of his work, as there is no privity between them. But it has
been ruled that a bill may be sustained by the owner of a sole fishery
against several persons who claimed under distinct rights. The only
difference between these cases would seem fo be, that the right of
fishery was necessarily more limited than that of authorship. And
how this should cause any difference-of principle between the cases
is not easily . perceived.
It is well remarked by Lord Cottenham, in Campbell v. Mackay,
7 Simon, 564, and in 1 Mylne and Craig, 603, cc to lay down any
rule, applicable universally, or to say, what constitutes multifariousness, as an abstract proposition, is, upon the authorities, utterly impossible." Every case must be governed by its own circumstances;
and a$ these are as diversified as the names of the parties, the court
must exercise a sound discretion on the subject. Whilst parties
should not be subjected to expense and inconvenience, in litigating
matters in which they have no interest, multiplicity of suits should be
avoided, by uniting in one bill all who have an interest in the
principal matter in controversy, though the interests may have arisen
under distinct contracts.
In a course of reasoning in the above-cited case, Lord Cottenham
observes, cc If, for instance, a father executed three deeds, all vesting
property in the same trustees, and upon similar-trusts, for the benefit
of his children, although the instruments and the parties beneficially
interested under all of them were the same, it -would be necessary to
have as many suits as there were instruments, That is a proposition,

JANUARY TERM, 1844.

643

Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

(he says,) to which I do not assent. It would, indeed, be extremely
mischievous, if such a rule were established in point of law. No
possible advantage could be gained by it; and it would lead 'to a
multiplication of suits, in cases where it could answer no purpose to
have the subject-matter of contest split up into a variety of separate
bills." The same doctrine is found in Stoiy's Equity Pleadings,
sect. 534; Attorney-General v. Cradock, 3 Mylne and Craig, 85;
7 Sim. Rep. 241, 254.
In the above case against Cradock, the chancellor says, cc The
object of the rule against "nutifariousness is to protect a defendant
from unnecessary expense; but it would be a great perversion of that
rule, if it were to impose upon the plaintiffs, and all the other defendants, two suits instead of one. 1
The bill prays that the defendants, Relf and Chew, maybe decreed
to account for moneys, &c., which came into their hands, as executors, under the 'Will of 1811; and that the other defendants, who
purchased from them real and personal property, may be compelled
to surrender the same, and account, &c., on the ground that they had
notice of the fraud of the executors.
The right of the complainant, Myra, must be sustained under the
will of 1813, or as heir-at-law of Daniel Clark. The defendants
claim mediately or immediately under the till of 1811, although their
purchases were made at different times and for distnct parcels of the
property. They have a common source of title, but no conimon
interest in their purchases. And the question arises on this state of
facts, whether there is misjoinder or multifariousness in the bill, which
makes the defendants parties.
On the part of the complainants there is no misjoinder, whether the
claim be as devisee or heir-at-law. Aid the main ground of the
dei'ence, the validity of the will of 1811, *andthe'proceedings under
it, is common to all the defendant4. Their interests may be of greater,
or less extent, but that constitutes a difference in degree. only, and
not in principle. There can be no doubt ihat a bill might have been
filed against each of the defendants, but the question , is whether they
may not all be ipeluded in the, same bill.
The facts of th6 purchase, including notice, may be peculiar to each'
defendant; but these may b= ascertained without inconvenience or
expen'se to' co-defendants. In every fact-which goes to impair or
establish the authority of the executors, all the defendants are alike
interested. In its present form the bill avoids multiplicity of suits,

644

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew

et al.

without subjecting the defendants to inconvenience or unreasonable
expense. There are, however, two exceptions to this remark, one
of which relates to Caroline Barnes and her husband. She is represented to be a devisee in the will of -1813, and, consequently, can
have no common interest under the will of 1811. The other exception is, the prayer of the bill that the executors may account. In the
rendition of this account the other defendants have no interest, and
such a matter, therefore, ought n9t to be connected with the general
objects of the bill. The bill in these respects may be so amended,
in-the Circuit Court, as to avoid both the exceptions.
We come now to inquire " whether the court can entertain jurisdiction of this case, without probate of the will set up by the
complainants, and which they charge t6 have been destroyed' or
suppressed."
The bill charges that the will of 1813 was fraudulently suppressed
or destroyed by Reif; and that he fraudulently procured the will of
1811, in which he and Chew were named as executors, to be proved.
It is contended that the Court of Probate in Louisiana has exclusive
jurisdiction of the probate of wills, and that a Coult of Chancery can
exercise no jurisdiction in such a case.
In the Code of Practice, art. 924, it is declared, that "c Courts of
Probate have the iexclusive power :"
1. " To open and receive the proof of last wills and tesiaments,
and to order the execution and recording them." There are thirteen
other specifications which need not be named. By art. 925, it is
declared that, "the Courts of Probates shall have no jurisdiction
except in the cases enumerated in the preceding article, or in those
which shall be mentioned in the remaining part of this title."
In regard " to the opening and proving of wills," after providing
where application for probate shall be made, and the mode, the
following articles are adopted.
Art. 934. "cIf the will be contained in a seated packet, the judge
shall order the opening of it at the time appointed by him, and shall
then proceed to the proof of the will."
Art. 936. "cIf the petitidner alleges under oath in his petition, that
he isinformed that the will of the deceased, the opening of which
and its proof and. execution are prayed for, is deposited in the hands
of a notary or any other person, the judge shall isstie an order to such
notary or other person, directing him to produce the will or the
packet containing it, at a certain-time to be mentioned, that it

JANUARY TERM, 1844;

645

Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

may be opened and proved, or that the execution of it may be
ordered."
Art. 937. "If the notary or other individual to whom the said
order is directed, refuses to obey it, the judge shall issue an order to
arrest him, and if he does not adduce good reasons for not producing
the will, shall commit him to prison until'he, produces it; and he
shall be answerable in damages.to such persons as may suffer from
his refusal."
From the above provisions it is clear tiat, in Louisiana, the Court
of Probates has exclusive jurisdiction in the proof of wills; and that
its jurisdiction is not limited, like the ecclesiastical couft in England,
to wills whichdispose of personal property. Has a court of equity
power to set up a spoliated will, ahd carry it into efflect ?
Formerly it was a point on which doubts were entertained, whether
courts of equity could not relieve against a will fraudulently obtained.
And there are cases where cha'nery has exercised such a jurisdiction.
Maundy v. Maundy, 1 Chan. Rep. 66; Welly v. Thorniagh, Prc.
Chanc. 123 ; Goss v. Tracy, 1 P. Williams, 287; 2 Vernon, 700.
In other cases, -such a jurisdiction has been disclaimed, though the
fraud was fully established, as in Roberts v. Wynne, 1 Chan. Rep.
125 ; -cher v. Moss, 2 Vernon, 8. In another class of cases the
fraudulent actor has been held a trustee for the party injured. Her-'
bert v. Lawnes, I Chan. Rep. 13 ; Thynn v. Thyxn, 1 Vernon, 296 ;
Devenish v. Baines, Prec. Chan. 3; Barnesly -v.Powell, 1 Ves.
287. These cases present no very satisfactory result as to the question
under consideration. But since .the decision of Kenrick v. Bransby,
3 Brown's P. C. 359, and Webb v Cleverden, 2 Atkyns, 424, it
seems to be considered as settled, in England, that equity will not
set aside a will for fraud and imposition. The reason assigned is,
.where personal estate is disposed of by a fraudulent will, relief may.
be tiad in the ecclesiastical court; and at law, on a devise of real
property. Bennett v. Vade, 2 Atkyns, 324; 3 Atkyns, 17; Gingoll
v. Home, 9 Sim. 539; Jones v. Jones, 3 Mer. 171.
In the last case the Master of the Rolls sys, " it is impossible that,
at this time of day, it can be made a serious question, whether it be
in this court that the validity of a will, either of real or personal
estate, is to be determined."
In cases of fraud, equity has a concurrent jurisdiction with a court
of law, but in regard to a will charged to have been obtained through
fraud, this rule does not hold.' It may be difficult to assign any very

646

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v..Chew

et al.

satisfactory reason for. this. exception. That exclusive jurisdiction
over the probate of wills is vested in another tribunal, is the' only one
that tan he given.
By art. 1637 of the Civil Code, it is declared that " no-testament can
have effect unless it has been presented to the judge," &c. And in
:Clappier et al. v. Banks, 11Louis. Rep. 593, it is held, that a will
alleged , to be lost or destroyed and which has never been proved,
cannot be set up as evidence of title, in an action of revendication.
In Armstrong v. Administrators of Kosciusko, 12 Wheat. 169, this
court, held, that an action for a legacy could not be sustained under
a will which had not been proved in this country before a court of
probate, though it may have been effective, as a will, in the foreign
country where it was made.
In Tarver v. Tarver et al., 9 Peters, 180, one of the objects of
the bill being to set aside the probate of a will, the court said, "the
bill cannot be sustained for the purpose of avoiding the probate.
Thatshould have been. done, if at all, by an appeal, from the Court
of Probate, according to the provisions of the law of Alabama."
The American"decisions on this subject have followed the English
authorities. And a deliberate consideration of the questioft leads us
to say, that both the general and local law require the will of 1813
to be proved, before any title can be set up under it. But this result
does not authorize a negative answer to the second point. We think,
under the circumstances, that the complainants are entitled to full
and explicit answers from the defendants, in regard to the above
wills. These answers being obtained may be used as evidence
before the Court of Probate to establish the will of 1813 and revoke
that of 181L
In order that the complainants naty have the means of making, if
they shall see fit, a formal application to the Probate Court, for the
proof of the last will and the revocation of the first, having the
answers of the executors, jurisdiction as to this matter may be sustained. And, indeed, circumstances may arise, on this part of the
case, which shall require a more definite and efficient action by the
Circuit- Court. For if the Probate Court shall refuse to take jurisdiction, from a defect of power to bring the parties before it, lapse
of time, or on any other ground, and there shall be no remedy in the
higher courts of the state, it maybecome the duty of the Circuit Court,
having the parties before it, to require them to go before the Court of
Probates, and consent to the proof of the will of 1813 and the revoca-

Gaines et ux. v. Chew et a].

lion of that of 1811. And should this'procedure fail to procure the
requisite action on both wiHs, it will be a iatter for grave consideration, whether the inherent powers of a court of chancery may not
-afford a remedy where the right is clear, by -establishing the will of
1813. In the case of Barnesly v. Powell, I Ves. sen. 119, 284,287,
above cited, Lord Hardwicke decreed,' that the defendant should
consent, in the ecclesiastical court, to the revocation of the will in
controversy and"the granting of administration, &c. If the emergencies of the :ase shall require such a course as above indicated, it will
not be without the' sanction of Louisiana law. The twenty-first article of the Civil Code declares that, "in civil matters, where there is
no express law, the judge is bound to proceed and decide according
to equity. 'Tb decide equitably, 'an appeal is to be made to natural
law and reason, or received usages where positive law is silent.'"
This -view seemed to be necessary to show on what ground and
for what purpose jurisdiction may be exercised in reference to'the
will of 1813, though it has not been admitted to probate.
The third point is, "chas the court jurisdiction in this case;-or does
it belong exclusively to a court of law?"
Much that has been said in relation to jurisdiction on the second
point, .equally applies to this one. Indeed, they might have been
considered under the same general head.
The bill is inartificially drawn, and, to reach its main objects, may
require amendment in the Circuit Court. It presents the right of the
complainants in two aspects:
1. Under the will of 1813.
2. As heir-at-law of the deceased.
The first has been examined, ;nd we will now consider the second.
'In prosecuting their rights as heir-at-law by the complainants, no'
probate of: the 'will' of 1813 will be required. The complainants
must rest upoii their heirship of the said Myra; the fraud charged
against the -executors, in setting up and proving- the will of 1811,
and notice of such fraud by the purchasers. In this form of procedure, ihe will of 1811 is brought before the court-collaterally. -It is
not an a.;fion. of nullity, but a proceeding which may enable the court
to give' the proper relief without decreeing the revocation'of the wili.
Stuch a proceeding at law in regard to real estate 'is one of ordinary
occurrence in England. And it is upon the ground that. such a
remedy is plain and adequate, that equity will not give relief. There
can be no.d6ubt' as between the heir-at-law and devisee, in ordinary

648

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

cases, the proper remedy is to be found in a court of law. Without
enlarging on this point, at present, we will refer to the doctrine on
this subject as established by the Louisiana courts. The case of
O'Donagan v. Knox, 11 Louis. Rep. 384, was "an heir-at-law claiming a share of the succession of her deceased sister, who was the
wife of the defendant, who holds possession of it under a will, as
instituted heir and universal legatee." The defendant pleaded to
the jurisdiction of the District Court, an the ground that the Court
of Probates for the parish St. Landry had exclusive jurisdiction of
the matters and things set up in the petition."
The district judge held, "that as the will sought to be annulled
had been admitted to probate, and ordered to be executed, the court
had no jurisdiction, but that the Probate Court had exclusive jurisdiction of the case."
After stating the above decision of the District Court, the Supreme
Court say, " The plaintiff sets ip a claim under the law of inheritance
to lands, slaves, and a variety of movable property; that these are
proper subjects for the exercise of the jurisdiction of district courts
cannot be doubted. But the petitioner proceeds further, and alleges
the nullity of the will, which constitutes -the very title under which
the d6fendant holds the proper.ty in controversy. Before what court
then must the validity of'this will be tested?"
The court consider the jurisdiction of the Court of Probates, and
then proceed to say, c It appears that the jurisdiction of the courts
of piobates is limited to claims against successions for money, and
that all claims for real property appertain to the ordinary tribunals,
and are denied to courts of probate. The plaintiff in this case was,
therefore, compelled, in suing for the property of the succession, to
seek redress in the District Court, and whether she attacked the will,
or the defendant set it up as his title to the property, the court having
cognisance of the subject must of necessity examine into its legal effect."
"When in an action, of revendication a -testament with probate
becomes a subject of. controversy, it will surely not be contended,"
say the court,- "that a court of ordinary jurisd.ictio, having cognisance of the principal matter, shall suspend its proceedings until
another court of limited powers shall pronounce upon. the subject."
c If the ordinary courts should examine into the validity of testaments,' drawn in controversy before them, they will do no more than
we have often said a court of limited jurisdiction may do, even in
relation to a question it could not directly entertain." The court cite

Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

Lewis's heirs v. His executors, 5.Louis. Rep. 387, and say there is no
conflict, as indeed there is none, between that case and the one
before them. They say that in the case before them the functions
of the executor had expired, the probate of the will had taken effect,
and the devisee had entered into possession under it. The decision
of the District Court was reversed on the ground that it had jurisdiction of the case.
The above doctrine is fully affirmed in Robert v. Allier's agent,
17 Louis. Rep. 15. "On the question of jurisdiction arising from
the state of the case, we understand," say the court, "the distinction
repeatedly made by this court to be, that whenever the validity or
legality of a will is attacked, and put at issue,.(as in the present case,)
at the time that an order for its execution is applied for, or after it
has been regularly probated and ordered to be executed, but previous
to the heirs or legatees coming into possession of the estate under it,
Courts of Probate alone have jurisdiction to declare it void." " But
when an action of revendication is instituted by an heir-at-law,
against the testamentary heir or universal legatee who has .been put
in possession of the estate, and who sets up the will as his title to the
property, District Courts are the proper tribunals in which suits must
be brought." 6 Martin's N. S. 263 2 Louis. Rep. 23
The functions of the executors under the will of 1811 have long
since terminated, ahd the property of the deceased- both real. and
personal, has passed -into the hands 'of. purchasers. If the heir-atlaw and the devisee were the only litigant parties, a suit at common
law might afford-an adequate remedy. But the controversy is rendered complicated by the numerous paries and the variouscircumstances under which their purchases were made. Besides, many
facts essential to the complainant's rights are within the knowledge
of the defendants, and may be proved only by their answers. -Of
this character is the fraud charged against the executors in proving
the will and acting under it, and the notice 6f such'fraud before their
purchase, alleged igainst the other defe gnts.
If the fraud shall be established against the executors, and a notice
of the fraud by the other defendants, they must be considered, though
the sales have.the forms of law, as holding the property in trust for
the complainants. Under these circumstances a suit at law euld
not give. adequate relief. A surrender of papers alid a relinquishment of ie may become necessary. The powers of a Court of ChanVOL.1I..-82

Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

cery, in this view, are required to do complete justice between the
parties.
This remedy under the Louisiana law, and before the Louisiana
courts, of ordinary jurisdiction, would be undoubted. For, although
those courts cannot annul the probate of a will, when presented collaterally, as a muniment of title, they inquire into its validity. Under
the peculiar system of that state the forms of procedure being conformable to the civil law, are the same in all cases. But the Circuit
Court of the United States, exercising jurisdiction in Louisiana, as
'in every other state, preserves distinct the common law and chancery
powers. In either the state or federal court the relief is the same;
the difference consists only in the mode of giving it.
It is insisted that trusts are abolished by the-Louisiana code, and
that, consequently, that great branch of equity jurisdiction cannot be
exercised in that state.
Art. 1507 of the Civil Code declares, " that substitutions and fidei
commissa are and remain prohibited." "Every disposition by which
the donee, the heir or legatee, is charged to preserve for, or to return
a thing to a third person, is null, even with regard to the donee, the
instituted heir, or the legatee," &c.
This abolishes express trusts, but it does not reach nor affect that
trust which the law implies from the fraud of an individual who has,
against conscience and right', possessed himself of another's property.
In such a case the Louisiatia law affords redress as speedily and
amply as the law of any other state. There is, therefore, no foundation for the allegation, that an implied trust, which is the -creature of
equity, has been abrogated in Louisiana. Under another name it is
preserved there in itp full vigour and effect. Without this principle,
justice, cotld -not be administered. One" man possesses himself
wrongfully and fraudulently of the property of another; in equity,,
he h6lds such property in trust, for the rightful owner.
In answer 'fo the objection, that the validity of the will of 1811,
collaterally, can only be tested b an action at law and on an issue devisavit vel non, it may be said, that such an issue may be directed by
the Cirjuit Court.
'Complaint is made that the' federal government has, imposed a
foreign law upon Louisiana. -There is no ground for this complaint.
The cb urts of the'United States-have involved no new or foreign.
principle in. Louisiaia.' In' deciding contversies .in that state the
local law- governs, the same as in every other state. Believing that

JANUARY TERM, 1844.

651

Gaines et.ux. v. Chew et al.1

the mode of proceeding there in the state courts,-was adequate to all
the purposes of justice; and knowing with what pertinacity even
forms are adhered to, I was averse to any change of the practice in
the federal courts. But I was overruled; and I see in the change
only a change of mode, which produces uniformity in the federal
courts, throughout the Union. No right is jeoparded by this, and to
say the least, wrongs are as well redressed, and rights as well protected, by the forms of chancery as by the forms of t&ie civil law.
From the foregoing considerations, the court answer the first point
certified in the affirmative, subject to the amendments of the bill, as
suggested. And they answer the second and third points, with the
qualifications stated, also in the affirmative.
Mr. Justice CATRON.
I agree the points certified must be answered favourably to the
complainants; but I do not altogether agree with the reasoning that
has-led a majority of my brethren to this conclusion.
The answer to the second questi6n, controls the answers to thd
others; it is, "Can the Circuit Court entertain jurisdiction of this
case, without probate of the will set up by the complainants, and
which they charge -to have been destroyed, or suppressed ?"
The will of 1813, cannot be set up, without a destruction of the
will of 1811; this will has been duly proved, and stands as a title to
the succession of the estate of Daniel Clark; nor can the Circuit
Court of the United. States set the probate -aside. this can only be
done by.the Probate Court.
Nor can the will of 1813, be set up in chancery, as an inconsistent
and opposing succession to the estate, while the will of 1811, is standing in full. force. Such is the doctrine in the English Court of Chancery, as will be seen by the cases of 'Archer v. Mosse, 2 Vera.*8
Beale v. Plume, 1 P. Wins. 388-and which are confirmed by the case
of Kenrick v. Barnsby in the House of Lords, 7 Bro. P. Cases, 437.
Nor do the doubtful suggestions of Lord -Hardwicke in Barnsby v.
Powel, 1 Ves. sen. 119, 284,- conflict with the previously settled.
doctrine, as I underistand that-case. The argument that a fraudulent
probate is a fraud on the living, and therefore hancery. can give relief by settiig aside such probate, is a mistaken idea of the chancery
powers. Surely the probate of afiaudulentor forged paperis-a fiaud
on the living,:as much as he suppression-,.of the last will, and the
causing to be proved, a revoked one ;-still chancery has notassumed"

652

SUPREME COURT.
Gaines et ux. v. Chew et al.

jurisdiction to set aside the probate of a will alleged to have been
forged.or to be fraudulent, after the testator's death; as will be seen
by the cases cited; although he who committed the fraud, or
forgery, procured'the probate to be had of the paper, in the Probate
Court.
It by no means follows, however, that the court below has no
jurisdiction of the case made by the bill-in one of its aspects. Mrs.
Gaines claims to be the only child and lawful heir of Taniel
Clark. This we must.take to be true. By the Civil Code of 1808,
oh. 3, sec. 1, art. 19, p. 212, it is declared "That donations either
inter-vivos, or mortis caitsa, cannot exceed the fifth part of the property
of the disposer, if he leaves at his decease one or more legitimate
children or descendants, born or to be born."
'By the case made in the bill, Mr. Clark could only dispose of onefifth part of his property at the time bf his death; provided he had
no wife living; and if she was livin.,r, then only of the one-fifth part
of one half. It follows, if the will of 1811, is.permitted to stand as
Daniel Clark's last and only will, that Mrs. Gaines can come in as
heir for the four-fifths. On this aspect'of the bill she can proceed to
establish, and enforce her rights as heir, without making probate of
the wfll of 1813-and the second question must be answered in the
affirmative.
By the will of 1811, Mary Clark is the principal devisee. Shh
made her will and died; "bythis will, Caroline Barnes is entitled to
part of Daniel Clark's estate, and ought to be before the court to
maintain her rights. I, therefore, do not concur *that as to her the
bill is multifarious. As to the purchasers from the executors, I have
more difficulty. I agree, where there is one common title in the
complainant; and this could only be the true source of all the titles
in all the defendants, and they have not obtained the first link in the
chain. of title; that than the true owner may sue them together in
chancery, although they claim by separate purchases froth a spurious
source. Such is the geneial rule; nor do I think the purchasers
frcm Chew and Relfe, are exempt from its operation, on the ground
that they have no concern with the settlement of the accounts growing out of the 'administration. I therefore concur in answering the
first question-that the bill is not multifarious.
The third question presents no difficulty as to the executors; they
are properly sued'in chancery for distribution beyond doubt: and so
I imagine are the devisees of Mary Clark; they being by the will of

H-anson et aL. i,. Eustace's Lessee.

Mrs. Clark co-distributees with Mrs. Gaines under the will of 1811,
as to the one-fifth part of Daniel Clark's estate.
The purchasers are charged with having purchased with knowledge
of Mrs. Gaines's superior title; and with having fraudulently purchased from the execut6rs with such knowledge; there being jurisdiction to grant relief against the executors, in chancery, th6 same
court can grant relief against the purchasers, involved in the fraud.
of the executors. If they could be compelled to account in regard to
the -real estate when it remained in their hands; purchasers with
notice of Mrs. Gaines's rights; and who purchased with the intention
to defeat her rights and deprive her of them, can stand in no better
situation than the executors, an4 must account likewise; both being
held in a court of equity equally as trustees for the 'true owner.
Therefore, on the face of the bill, a-court of equity has jurisdiction;
and a court of law has not exclusive jurisdiction, and thus the third.
point ought to be certified.
