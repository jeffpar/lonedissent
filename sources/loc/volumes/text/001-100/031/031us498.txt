SUPREME COURT.

JosEPH BARCLAY, FLORENCE COLTER AND JOHN M. SNOWDEN,
PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR V. RICHARD W. HOWELL'S LESSEE.
Ejectment. 'i ne declaration described the property for which the suit was instituted as" lying bet*een Water street and the river Monongahela, with the
appiurtenancessituate and being in the city of Pittsburgh," The jury found a
general verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendants assigned for error, that the
verdict, being general, is void for the want of certainty. By the court: This
must be considered as an exception to the sufficiency of the declaration; as
any other matter embraced in it might have been considered on a motion for
a new trial, but cannot now be noticed.
Formerly it was necessary to describe the premises for which an action of ejectment was brought with great accuracy; but far less certainty is required in modern practice. All the authorities say that the general description is good.
The lessor of the plaintiff, on a lease for a specific number of acres, may recover any quantity of less amount.
The plaintiffs in error, defendants in ejcetment in the circuit court, claimed for the
city ofPittsburgh, a slip ofland lying on the bank of the river Monongahela near the
junction of that river with the river A41eghany, being a space between thesouthern
line of the lots of the city, and the Monongahela river. It was contended by them,
that this slip of land was dedicated by the surveyor, when he laid out the town,
to the public, as a street, or for other public uses. The depositions of witnesses
who were present when the ground on which the city stands, was laid out in
lots by the surveyor, authorised so to do by the proprietors of the land, were
offered to prove declAations of the surveyor, made to personsassembled at the
survey, and who occupied part of the ground so laid out; by which declarations,
and other acts of the surveyor, also proposed to be proved, it was contended
the said dedication was made; i. e. that he had observed that "the street," the
slip Qfland," to low water mark, should be for the use of the citizens, and the
public, for ever." By the court: The surveyor had authority to fix upon the
plan of the town and survey it. He bad the power to determine the width of
the respective streets and alleys, the size and form of the lots, to mark out the
public grounds, and to determine on every thing so far as related to the town,
and its beauty, convenience and value. These were clearly within the scope
of his powers, as they were essentially connected with the plan of the town,
on which he was authorized to determine at his discretion. The proof of such
declarations should have been admitted by the circuit court; because, under the
circumstances, they formed a part of the transaction.
The declarations of a surveyor which contradict his official return, are clearly not
evidence: nor ought they to be received, where he has no power to exercise
discretion, as explanatory of his return, while he is still living, and may be examined as a witness.
If the ground in controversy in the ejeetment had been dedicated for a particu.
lar purpose, and the city authorities had appropriated it to an entirely different
purpose, it might afford ground for the interferenceof a court of chancerjto
compel a specific execution of the trust, by restraining the corporation, or by

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.3
causing the removal of obstructions. But even in such a case, the property
dedicated would not revert to the original owner. The use would still remain
in the public, limited only by the conditions imposed in the grant.
The right of the court to decide on the legal effect of a written instrument, cannot
be controverted; but the question of boundary Is always a matter of fct for the
determination of the jury.
It Is the province of the court, in an action of ejectment, that they should fix the
boundaries of the tract in controversy by an examination of the whole evidence.
Artificial or natural boundaries called for, control a call for course and distance.
An unmolested possession for thirty years would authorise the presumption of a
grant. Under peculiar circumstances, a grant has been presumed from a possession less than the number of years required to bar the action of ejectment
by the statute of limitations.
By the common law, the fee in the soil remains in the original owner, where a
public road is made upon it, but the use of the road is in the public. The
owner parts with this use only; for if the road should be vacated by the public, he resumes the exclusive possession of the ground; and while it is used
as a high-way, he is entitled to the timber and grass wfh'ich may grow upon the
surface, and to all minerals which may be found below it. He may bring an
action of trespass against any one who obstructs the road.
Where the propfietor of a towh disposes of all his interest in it, he would seem to
stand in a different relation to the right of soil, in regard to the streets and
alleys of the town, from the Individual owner over whose soil a public road is
established, and who continues to hold the land on both sides of it. Whether
the purchasers of town lots are in this respect the owners of the soil over
which the streets and alleys are laid as appurtenant to adjoining lots, Quwre.
In some cases a dedication of property to public use; as for instance a street or
public road, where the public has enjoyed the unmolested use of it for six or
seven years; has been deemed sufficieni for dedication.

ERROR to the circuit court of the United States, for the eastern district of Pennsylvania.
This was an ejectment originally instituted in the district
court for the western district of Pennsylvania, and removed to
the circuit court for the eastern district, under the act of congress of March 3, 1821; the judge of the western district having been counsel in a former ejectment, involving the same
matter in controversy.
The defendant in error, the plaintiff below, claimed in the
declaration, "one messuage, a lot, or piece or parcel of land,
lying between Water street and the river Monongahela, with
the appurtenances situate and being in the city of Pittsburgh."
The cause came on for trial at the circuit court for the castMr Justice Baldwin did not sit in this case, he having been of counsel for
the defendant in error, in the circuit court.

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

ern district of Pennsylvania at the April term 1829, and the
jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff in the ejectment.
The defendants prosecuted this writ of error.
On the trial, a bill of exceptions was tendered by the defendants to the ruling of the circuit court, as to the introduction
of certain evidence, and also to several of the matters contained
in the charge of the court; all which are particularly stated in
the opinion of this court.
The case was argued by Mr Wilkins, for the plaintiffs in
error; and by Mr Sergeant for the defendant.
Mr Justice M'LEAi delivered the opinion of the Court.
This suit was brought in the western district of Pennsylvania, to recover a lot of ground in the city of Pittsburgh, described in the .declaration as lying between Water street and
the river Monongahela. As the district judge could not sit in
the cause, it was certified to the eastern district, under the act
of congress.
The defendants in the court below appeared in behalf of the
city and defended the action, on the ground that the entire slip
of land between the north line of Water street and the river,
was dedicated, at the time the town was laid out, as a street or
right of way to the public.
The lessor of the plaintiff exhibited legal conveyances for
the lot in controversy.
At the trial, various exceptions were taken to the ruling of
the court, in the rejection of evidence offered by the defendants, and also to the charge of the court to the jury. These
exceptions are brought before this court for consideration, by
a writ of error.
The first assignment of error is, in substance, that the verdict being general, is void for want of certainty. That the
finding of the jury did not settle the- matter in controversy;
aLid by consequence, did not authorise the judgment.
This must be considered as an exception to the sufficiency
of the declaration; as any other matter embraced by it might
have been considered on a motion for a neN .rial, but cannot
now be noticed.
The description of the lot in the declaration is general, as
lying between Water street and the river; but no doubt is

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.)

entertained that this is a sufficient description. Formerly, it
was necessary to d~scribe the premises for which an action of
ejectiait was brought with great accuracy; but far less certainty is requisite in modern practice. All the authorities say
that a general description is good. The lessor of the plaintiff,
on a lease foi a specific number of acres, may recover any
quantity of less amount.
The rejection of the evidence contained in the depositions
of Samuel Ewalt and John Finley, is the second error assigned.
To understand the force of this exception, it will be necessary to advert to a succinct history of the case.
There was vested in the Penn family a tract of land consisting
of between five and six thousand acres that included the village of Pittsburgh, which at that time consisted of a small
number of settlers, very few, if any of whom, had a title to the
lots they occupied. This tract was denominated a manor, as
was the practice at that time to call large tracts of land, which
had been surveyed within the charter of the original proprietor
of Pennsylvania. Being desirous of laying out a town at
Pittsburgh, Tench Francis, who acted as the attorney of John
Penn, Jun. and John Penn, addressed the following letter to
George Woods, Esquire.
Philadelphia, 22d April 1784.
Sir-By directions of Messrs Penns, I take the liberty to
request you to undertake the laying out of the town of Pittsburgh, and dividing all the other parts of the manor into proper
lots and farms, and to set a value on each, supposing them
clear of any kind of incumbrances, in doing of which, be
pleased to make the proper inquiries, and ascertain the previous
claims, pretended or not, of the present settlers, and all others
set up. The whole of the manor being intended for immediate
sale, I wish you would point out the best method to effect it;
and if agreeable to you to transact this business, inform me on
what terms you will do it. All expenses, and your charges
for making the above survey, I will pay, &c.
In the month of May or June of the same year, Woods laid
out the town of Pittsburgh, and also surveyed into out lots and
small plantations, the residue of the manor; and made return
to his principal of a copy of the town plat and the other sur-

veys. This return, and the whole proceedings of Woods,
were sanctioned by the following letter.
Philadelphia, 30th September 1784.
Dear Sir-As attorney to John Penn, Junior, and John Penn,
Esquires, late proprietors of Pennsylvania, I hereby approve
of the plan you have made of the town of Pittsburgh, and now
confirm the same, together with the division of the out lots
and the other part of the manor of Pittsburgh. The several
appliers, agreeable to your list furnished me, may depend on
having deeds for their lots and plantations, whenever they pay
TENCH FRANCIS.
the whole of the purchase money, &e.
GEORGE WooDs, Esquire.
The original plat of the town of Pittsburgh, which was made
by Woods, was givei in evidence to the jury; from which it
appears that the town was laid out into lots, streets and alleys,
from the junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers,
extending up the latter to Grant street. With the exception
of Water street, which lies along the bank of the Monongahela, all the str, ets and alleys of the town were distinctly
marked by the surveyor, and their width laid down. Near
fhe junction of the rivers, the space between the southern line
of the lots and the Monongahela river is narrow, but it widens
as the lots extend up the river.
It was contended by the defendants in the ejectment, that the
before described slip of land Was dedicated by the surveyorwhen
he laid out the town, to the public as a street, or for other public
uses. As the lot for which the ejectmeht was brought is situated in this narrow strip of land, the fact of dedication becomes
material.
From the plan of the town, it does pot appear that any artificial boundary, as the southern limit of Water street, was laid
down. The name of the street is given, and its northern
boundary; but the space to the south is left open to the river.
A:ll the streets leading south, terminate at Water street; and
no indication is given in the plat, or in any part of the return
of the surveyor, that Water street did not extend to the river,
as it appears to do by the face of the plat.
The depositions of Ewalt and Finley were offered by the
defendants, to prove the declarations of Woods at the time

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and otbers v. Howell's Lessee.]

the survey of the town was made. Ewalt stated, that the survey was about to be commenced at a point which would have
required him to remove his house, and that at his instance the
place of beginning was changed. On a remonstrance being
made by several persons who had assembled, that Water street
would be too narrow, Mr Woods observed to the party, "these
houses will not remain or stand very long; you will, build new
houses and dig cellars, and bank out Water street as wide, till
it comes to low watei mark, if you please." He observed,
"that this street, to low water mark, should be for the use of
the citizens and the public forever."
Finley states that Woods declared to the people of the town,
that he would not change the old military plan; but that
"Water street should be left open to the river's edge, at low
water mark, for the use of said town; that they, the citizens,
might use the same as landings, build walls, make wharves, or
plant trees at their pleasure."
Several objections are male to the competency of this testimony.
It is insisted, that the declarations of Woods respecting the
ground in controversy, did not come within the scope of his
authority; and if they did, still, that they ought. not to be received in evidence.
Woods had authority to fix upon the plan of the town, and
survey it. Ile had the power to determine the width of the
respective streets and alleys, the size and form of the lots, to
mark out the public grounds, and to determine on every thing
so far as related to the town, which would add to its beauty,
convenience, and value. These were clearly within the scope
of his powers, as they were essentially connected with the
plan of the town, on which he was authorised to determine at
his discretion.
But it is said that his acts, until sanctioned, were not binding upon his principal; and that as his principal was not present, his sanction, which was subsequently given, cannot be
extended beyond what appears upon the town plat, which was
returned by the agent.
The sanction, when given, related back to the original transaction; and gave equal effect to it, as if the principal had been
present. So far as valuations had been made of the lots occu-

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclayand others v. Howell's Lessee.]

pied by persons who had no titles, and who were to obtain
titles on paying the prices fixed by Woods, it is very clear,
that the principal could not be bound, by the act of confirmation, beyond what appeared upon the face of the return ; nor,
if the agent had attempted, by any covert means, to give to
the citizens of the town ground which he did not designate on
his return, and which did not tend, directly, to increase the
value of the town lots. But if the ground dedicated for a
street or any other public use, was essentially connected with
the town lots, and must have enhanced their value at the sale,
the increased value thus realized, and a long acquiescence,
would-estop the original owner of the fee from asserting his
claim, though the ground dedicated had not been so designated
on the map.
There is nothing, however, on the plat which shows any
limits to the width of Water street, short of the river on the
south. If a line had been drawn along its southern limit,
there would have been great force in the argument that the
ground between such limit and the water was reserved by the
proprietors. This would have been the legal consequence
from such a survey, unless the contrary had been shown.
It must be admitted that the declarations of an agent, respecting things done within the scope of his authority, are not
evidence to charge his principal, unless they were made at the
time the act was done, and formed a part of the transaction.
The declarations referred to were a part of the res gesta; they
were explanatory of the act then being done; and they do not,
as was contended, contradict the return, but tend to explain
and confirm it.
The souihern limit of Water street was the point of inquiry
before the jury. It was a question of boundary, and governed
by the same rules of evidence which are of daily application
in such a case. In this view, were not the declarations of the
person who fixed the boundary legal evidence? Not declarations casually made at a different time from that at which the
survey was executed, but at the very time the act was done.
The'proof of such declarations should have been admitted by
the circuit court; because, under the circumstances, they formed
a part of the transaction.
The declarations of a surveyor which contradict his official

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

return, are clearly not evidence; nor ought they to be received,
where he has no puwer to exercise a discretion as explanatory
of his return, while he is still living, and may be examined
as a witness.
The exception taken to the rejection of Coates's deposition
is abandoned.
Several exceptiohs were made to the charge of the court to

the jury.
1. " In saying that the property in question passed to Wilson, unless the jury should decide that the Whole ground to
the river was not only dedicated as a street, but that it must
be capable of being used as such: that it was used as a highway
or street, and that the slip of land, if it was not wholly given
to the public as a street, or so much of it as was not so given,
vested in the proprietors, as the undisputed owners of it."
As the fee to this property was vested in the Penn family,
at the time the town was laid out, it is a clear proposition that
such parts of the land as were not conveyed to the purchasers,
or dedicated to the public, remained in the proprietors. But
that part of the charge which instructed the jury, that it must
appear that the ground to the river was not only capable of
being used as a street, but had been so used, is conceived to
be erroneous.
From the evidence in the cause, it appears, that the northern bank of the Monongahela, from its junction with the Alleghany, to the extent of the town plat, still remains elevated
in many places; but several of the streets leading south, have
been extended to the river, and they have been so graduated,
as to admit of an easy approach to the water.
When complaint was made to Woods, that Water street
would be too narrow, he observed, that its width might be artificially extended, for the convenience of the citizens, to
the river. From this, it appears, that the ground was not
then in a condition to be used as a street; and that much labour
was required to place it in that situation. But, if it were
dedicated for that purpose, at the time the survey of the
town was made, is it essential, that it shall have been used as
such within a limited time? This would hardly be pretended,
as it regards other streets in the town. Suppose Market
street or Wood street, leading north and south, had not been

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

improved by the city of Pittsburgh until this trne, could the
original proprietors claim. it as their property? If the dedication of these streets to the public were a matter of doubt, and
a jury were about to inquire into the fact; it is admitted, that
their not having been improved or used as streets, would be a
circumstance which the jury might weigh against the proof
of dedication. But it would most clearly be error for the
court to instruct the jury, that unless the ground claimed for
these streets was in a situation to be used as streets, and had
been so used, there could have been no dedication, This appear~s to have been the purport of the instruction to the jury,
in regard to Water street. The words used were, that the
jury must be "satisfied, not merely that the open space was
used by the inhabitants of Pittsburgh or others, but that it was
used as a highway or street; and that in weighing the evidence
on this point, they would naturally inquire, whether, from
the nature of the ground, it was capable of being so used."
From this instruction the jury were required to find against
the right asserted in behalf of the city, unless the ground referred to had been used as a street or highway. This substituted the use for the right; and made the latter to depend
upon the former. The right was not necessarily connected
with the use within a limited period; as no such condition appears to have been imposed'at the time it was granted. Whilst
the circuit court might have called the attention of the jury to
the fact, that the ground in controversy never having been used
as a street, was a circumstance which they ought to weigh
against the dedication contended for, it was error in them to
say, in substance, there could be no right without the use.
This withdrew from the jury the main point of inquiry, by
substituting another; the existence or non-existence of which
was not inconsistent with the principal fact. It was not essential for the city to show that the entire slip of land referred
to had been used as a street, but it was essential to establish
that iihad been dedicated as such.
The second objection to the charge is, that the court instracted "cthe jury that no title in the corporation had been
shown to a single foot of ground within the city; and that the
acts of ownership, exercised by the corporation, were altogether inconsistent with the right asserted in behalf of the

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

public: and plainly conveying to the jury the opinion that the
improper or peculiar use made of the ground in question by
the corporation, gave the plaintiff a right to recover."
The inference drawn in the conclusion of this assignment
of error, may not be fully sustained by the language of the
court; but they did instruct the jury, that the acts of "ownership exercised by the corporation, in the way which had been
stated, were altogether inconsistent with the right asserted in
behalf of the public; since, if the whole of this ground to low
water mark on the river, had been dedicated for a street, it
was vested as such in the public, subject to be regulated and
preserved by the corporation, and could not legally be treated
and used as private property by that body."
The court here refer to certain wharves, which have been
constructed by the city along the Monongahela, and on the
ground claimed to be Water street. Connected with these
wharves is a graduated pavement, so as to render access to them
from the city easy; and a tax is imposed on steamboats and
other vessels, for the use of them.
If this ground had been dedicated for a particular purpose,
and the city authorities had appr6priated it to an entirely different purpose; it might afford ground for the interference of a
court of chancery, to compel a .specific execution of the trust,
by restraining the corporation, or by causing the removal of
obstructions. But, even in such a case, the property dedicated
would not revert to the original owner. The use would still
remain in the public, limited, only, by the conditions imposed
in the grant.
It does not appear, however, that the construction of wharves
on the river, and the pavement of the ground, have, in the
least degree, obstructed its use as a street. The pavement
has, undoubtedly, promoted the public convenience; and if
the whole line of the street were graduated and paved to the
water as a public way, it would be much more valuable than
in its present condition. The wharves cause no obstructions to
the use of this ground as a street; and whether the city authorities have transcended their power in raising a revenue from
them, by the improvements which have been made, is a question not necessarily involved in the case.
If that part of this ground which is connected with the wa-

SUPREME COURT.
rBarclay and otbers v. Howell's Lessee.]

ter, has been appropriated to other uses than as a right of way,
they are not inconsistent with such right; but if such had been
the case, on that ground the jury could not have rendered a
verdict against the city. Such uses might have tended to
show, that the dedication of this ground for a street, as contended for, had not been made; but no other or greater effect
should have been given to them, had they been fully estahlished, and their inconsistency with the right asserted clearly
made out.
The third objection taken to the charge is, that the court
instructed "the jury that the deeds of Ormsby, and to Craig
and Bayard, were inconsistent with a dedication of a space
south of the Water street lots to, the river; and that these
deeds conveyed the ground to the river, subject to the easement over a part of it."
The deed of Ormsby to Gregg and Sidney bears date the
fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven haindred 'and ninety-eight, and was for "a certain lot of
ground, situate in the town of Pittsburgh aforesaid, marked in
the plan of said town, numbeP one hundred and eighty-three,
bounded by Front street, the river Monongahela, and lots
numbered one hundred and eighty-two, and one hundred and
eighty-four; it being the same lot or piece of ground which
the honourable John Penn and John Penn, Jun., late proprietors of Pennsylvania, by their indenture, bearing date the second day of October one thousand seven hundred and eightyfour, did grant and convey unto the raid Ormsby."
The deed. to Craig and Bayard from the Penns, bears date
the thirty-first (lay of December one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-four; and conveyed to the grantees "and their
heirs and assigns, thirty-two lots or pieces of ground, situate
in a point formed by the-junction of the two rivers Monongahela and Alleghany, in the town of Pittsburgh, marked in the
general plan of said town made by Colonel Woods, numbers
one, &c.; which said- plan is recorded, or intended to be recorded, in the office for.the recording of deeds for the county
of Westmoreland."
The said lots are bounded northwardly by the said Alleghany river, eastwardly by Morberry or Mulberry street, south-wardly by Penn street, and south-westwardly by he Alonongahela river.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee ]

The agreement under which this deed was executed, is
dated on the 22d day of January 1784, which was about six
months, before the town was surveyed. By this agreement,
the Penns sold to Craig and Bayard "a certain tract of land
in their manor of Pittsburgh, lying and being in a point formed
by the junction of the rivers Monongahela and Alleghany:
bounded on two sides by the rivers aforesaid," &c.
As this last deed covers ground which had been sold before
the town was laid out, it is not perceived how it could be considered as inconsistent with the dedication contended for. It
is true, the deed was not executed until after the town plat was
formed; but it was executed by force of a purchase made prior
to the survey of the town, and the purchaser had a right to insist on the boundaries designated in the agreement.
If the present contest were limited to the ground embraced
in this agreem-nt, and included in the general description of
the deed, it might become a serious question, whether the description, in the deed, of the lots, by their numbers as designated on Woods's plan of the town, would not control that
part of the description which refers to the Monongahela river.
But, if it were admitted that this deed conveyed the land to
the river, it could, under the circumstances, have no other
effect than to restrict the dedication of the ground for a street
to the extent of the deed.
The deed from Ormsby called for the lot by its number, as
marked on the plan of the town, ,and bounded by Front street,
the river Monongahela, and lots numbered one hundred and
eighty-two, and one hundred and eighty-four. The construction given to these calls was, that (he ground to the river was
conveyed, subject to the easement over a part of it. And this
deed, the jury was instructed, was inconsistent with the dedication of the ground to the water as a street.
It is contended, on the part of the defendant in error, that
the charge given to the jurT on this point, was the legal construction of the deed, and consequently was a matter for the
courC to determine.
The right of the court to decide on the legal effect of written
instruments, cannot be controverted; but the question of
boundary is always a matter of fact for the determination of
the jury. It is the province of a court to instruct the jury

S510

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

that ifiey should fix the boundaries of the tract in controversy
by an examination of the whole evidence; and that artificial
or natural boundaries called for, control a call for course and
distance. But it would withdraw the facts from the jury, if
the court were to fix: the boundaries called for, and then de'termine on the legal effect of the instrument.
Suppose the controversy had been between the city of
Pittsburgh, and the persons claiming under Ormsby; who asserted a right to the ground, under his deed, to the rive.
The city in such a case would have contended, before the jury,
that taking the Palls of the deed together, they would limit
the conveyance to the lot designated on the plan of the town;
and would not this have been a question for the jury to determine, under the instruction of the court--an instruction,
which should lay down the general principles of law in such
a case, and the legal effect that would result from a certain
state of facts; but, which should not take from the jury the
right of determining on the limits of the lot, from the calls in
the deed? These calls are established by evidence extrinsic
of the deed; they are matters of fact, for the investigation of
the jury.
In principle, there is no difference between, the case under
consideration and questions of boundary,_ which are of daily
occurrence. It is as much the province of a jury to determine the limits of a lot in a city or town, as ihe limits of any
tract of land, however large or small. And, if the court, in a
question of boundary, may fix the limits of the grant, and then
say wht the legal effect of jt shall be, there is nothing left for
the action of the jury.
The deed from Ormsby called for a lot, designated on the
town- plat one hundred and eighty-three, bounded by Front
street, the river Monongahela, and lots numbered one hundred and eighty-two and one hundred and eighty-four.
The plat of the town which is referred to as containing a
designation of the boundaries of the lot, fixes those boundaries
as satisfactorily as any natural objects could fix them. Front
street is called for, which lies parallel with Water street, as
the northern boundary of the lot; and the adjoining lots lying
east and west of it, are named as the eastern and western boundaries

JANUARY TERM 1832.
(Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

From this description, can any one doubt the intention of the
grantor, and the understanding of the grantee? Does lot one
hundred and eighty-three, as marked on the plan of the town,
extend to the river ? This will not be pretended; nor that lots
one hundred and eighty-two and one hundred eighty-four extend
to the river. The call for the river, then. in the deed in question, is inconsistent with the other calls in the deed. PBy the
town plat, the southern boundary of the lot is limited by Water
street, and by a call for this boundary it is as fixed and certain as the call for the river. The same may be said of the
eastern and western boundary of the lot. $hall these calls be
all disregarded or controlled, by the single call for the natural
boundary?
In a,late case this couft decided, that a call in a patent for a
different county from that in which the land was situated,
might be controlled by other calls in the patent. Such was
the charge given to the jury in the court below, and it was
sustained by this court.
The circuit court, therefore, instead of saying to the jury
that the calls in this deed, and the one to Craig and Bayard,
were inconsistent with the dedication of the ground 'referred
to, should have instructed them, that the different calls ought
to be taken together; and that the calls for the river might be
controlled by the other calls in the deeds, if the jury should be
satisfied that such call had been inserted through inadvertence
or mistake.
The fourth and last exception taken to the charge of the
court is. that they erred in instructing the jury, "that if a
street or streets leading to the Monongahela river were necessary to the enjoyment, by the inhabitants, of their property in
the town, derived. from persons under whom the plaintiff
claimed, they are entitled to have them laid off over the land
in dispute, of right, and not of favour; and that the law points
out a mode by which this right may be enforced."
This instruction does not involve a point which was material
in the case: and though it were erroneous, it might not afford
ground for the reversal of the judgment of the circuit court.
Whether this right existed or not, it is not conceived how it
could have had any influence with the jury.
The court seem to refer to the law of Pennsylvania, regulating the opening of public roads. But the establishment of

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

a public road cannot be claimed as a matter of right. An application must be made in the first instance, by petition to the
court of quarter sessions; a view of the proposed road is directe.d, and its establishment depends upon the report of the
viewers and other necessary sanctions.
This law, however, it is insisted, could have no operation
in the city of Pittsburgh; that its streets and alleys are opened
and regulated under the corporate authorities, and not by the
provisions of the road law.
It is not deemed necessary, in deciding the points raised in
this case, to notice all the questions discussed by the counsel
in their arguments at the bar.
Whether Water street extended to low or high water mark,
can be of no importance in the present controversy. If its
southern boundary be limited by high water mark, it is clear
that the proprietors parted with all their right. It is admitted
by both parties, that the river Monongahela, bei,,g a navigable
stream, belongs to the public; and a free use of it may be rightfully cla -ed by the public, whatever may be the extent of its
volume of water. If Water street be bounded by the river on
the south, it is only limited by the public right. To contend
that between this boundary and the public right, a private and
hostile right could exist, would not only be unreasonable, but
against law.
Tench Francis, the attorney in fact for the Penn family,
and the agent who succeeded him, must be considered, for
some purposes, as the principal in these transactions. His
principals were in Europe; and to his discretion and superintendence they, of necessity, consigned the management of their
property in this country. The long acquiescence, therefore,
in the plan of the town, as returned by Woods, affords a strong
presumption against the Pight asserted by the plaintiff below
in this action.
The town was laid out in the spring or summer of 1784; no
act was done by the proprietors showing any claim to the land
in controversy, until September 1814, when the deed to Wilson was executed. Here is a lapse of about thirty years,
within which no right is asserted by the Penn family, hostile
to that which was exercised by the city, in the use of this
ground, to the extent which its means enabled it to improve,

JANUARY TERM 1S32.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

and the public convenience seemed to require.

A title whic!

has remained dormant for so great a number of years, and
whilb the property was used for public purposes, and necessarily within the knowledge of the agents of the proprietors, is
now asserted under doubtful circumstances of right. In some
cases a dedication of property to public use, as for instance a
street or public road, where the public has enjoyed the unmolested use of it for six or seven years, has been deemed sufficient evidence of dedication. This lapse of time, connected
with the public use and the determination expressed by the
agent at the time the town was laid out to dispose of the
whole of the manor, affords strong grounds to presume that no
reservation of any part of the manor was intended to be made;
and that the slip of land in controversy was not reserved.
These were facts proper for the consideration of the jury in
determining the -fact ofdedication. They were calculated to.
have a strong influence to rebut the presumptions relied on by
the plaintiff in the court below.
If it were necessary, an unmolested possession for thirty
years would authorise the presumption of a grant. Indeed,
under peculiar circumstances, a grant has been presumed from
a possession less than the number, of years required to bal' the
action of ejectment by the statute of limitations.
By the common law the fee in the soil remains in the original owner, where a public road is established over it; but the
use of the road is in the public. The owner parts with this
use only, for if the road shall be vacated by the public, he resumes the exclusive possession of the ground; and while it isused as a highway, he is entitled to the timber and grass which
may grow upon the surface, and fo all minerals which may be
found below it. He may bring an action of trespass against
any one who obstructs the road.
In the discussion of this case, the same doctrine nas oeen
applied by the counsel for the defendant in error to the streets
and alleys of a town; but in deciding the points raised by the
bill of exceptions, it is not necessary to determine this question.
Where the proprietor of a town disposes of all his interest
in it, he would seem to stand in a different relation to the right
of soil, in regard to the streets and alleys of the town, from
VOL. VI.-3 P

SUPREME COURT.
[Barclay and others v. Howell's Lessee.]

the individual over whose soil a public road is established,
and who continues to hold the land og both sides of it.
Whether the purchasers of town lots are not, in this respect,
the owners of the soil over which the streets and alleys are
laid, as appurtenant to the adjoining lots, is a point not essentially involved in this case.
If the jury shall find that the ground in question was dedi.
cated to the public as a street or highway, or for other publie
,purposes, to the river, either at high.or low water mark, the
right of the city will be established, and the plaintiff in the
ejectment must consequently fail to recover.
Upoh a deliberate consideration of the points involved in
the case, this court are clearly of the opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court was erroneous, and it is therefore
reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.
