PETER M'CARTEE.
Under the laws of New York, one citizen of the state cannot Inherit in the collateral line to the other, when he must make his pedigree or title through a deceasedalien ancestor.
The legislature must be presumed to use words in their known and ordinary signification, unless that sense be repelled by the context. "The common law"
is constantly used in contradistinction to the statute law.
Descents are, as is well known, of two sorts, lineal, as from father to son, or
grandfather to son or grandson; and collateral, as from brother to brother, and
cousip to cousin, &c. They are also distinguished into mediate and immediate.
But here the terms are susceptible of different interpretations, which circumstance has introduced some confusion into legal discussions, since different
judges have used them in different senses. A descent may be said to be mediate o' immediate in regard to the mediate or immediate descent of the estate
or right; or it ma- be-said to be mediate or immediate, in regard to the mediateness or immediateness of the pedigree or degrees of consanguinity.
Thus a descent from the grandfather, who dies in possession, to the grandchild, the father being then dead, or from the uncle to the nephew, the brother
being dead, is in law an immediate descent, although the one is collateral and
the otherlineal; for the heir is in the per, and not in theper and cui. Onthe other
hand, with reference to the line of pedigree or consanguinity, a descent is often
said to be immediate, when the ancestor from' ooL the party derives his
blood is, immediate and without any intervening link or degree; and mediate
when the kindred is derived from him, mediante altero, another ancestor intervening between them.
That an alien has no inheritable blood, and can neither take land himself by descent, or transmit land from himself to others by descent, is common learning.
The case of Collingwood v. Pace, 1 Ventris's Rep. 413, furnishes conclusive evidence that by the common law, in all cases of mediate descents, if any mediate
ancestor through whom the party makes his pedigree as beir is an alien, that
is a bar to his title as heir.

THIS case came before the court on a certificate of division
in opinion of the judges of the circuit court of the United
States for the southern district of New York.
In that court the-4essee of the plaintiffs instituted an action
of ejectment for the recovery of certain real estate in the city
of New York. The jury found the following special verdict.

"PHILIP JAcoBs."
But whether or not, upon the whole matters aforesaid, by
the jurors aforesaid in form aforesaid found, the said Peter
M'Cartee is guilty of the trespass and ejectment above mentioned, the jurors aforesaid are ignorant; and therefore they
pray the advice of the said circuit court of the United States of
America for the southern district of New York, in the second
circuit; and if. upon the wholem
matter aforesaid, it shall seem
to the said court that the said plaintiff is entitled to the possession of the said land and premises claimed by the plaintiff ih
this suit, or of any part thereof, then the jurors aforesaid, upon
their oath aforesaid, say, that the said Peter M'Cartee is guilty
of the trespass and ejectment aforesaid, in manger and form as
the said James Jackson hath above thereof complained against
him; and in that case they assess the damages of the said James
Jackson, on occasionof the trespass and ejectment aforesaid,
besides his costs and charges by him about his suit in that behalf expended, to, six cents, and for his costs and charges to
six cents.
But if, upon the whole matter aforesaid, it shall seem to the
said court that the plaintiff is not entitled to the possession of
the said land and premises so claimed by the plaintiffs as afore-

SUPREME COURT.
[Lesee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.]

said, nor of any part thereof, then the jurors aforesaid, upon
their oaths aforesaid, say that the said Peter M'Cartee is not
guilty of the trespass and ejectment aforesaid, in manner and
form as the said James Jackson hath above thereof complained
against him.
And at the October term of the court 1829, the cause came
on for argument upon the said special verdict.
And at.the said argument before the said judges, it was contended by the plaintiff's counsel, on his part, that the said lessors, Bella Cohen and Rhina Mordecai, were capable of taking
the premises described in said special verdict, whereof the said
Philip Jacobs died seised, as therein stated, as heirs at law of
the said Jacobs, and his said child; and that the said estate descended and came to the said Bella and Rhina, notwithstanding
the alienism of the mother of the said Philip Jacdbs, and his
maternal uncle, Leipman Cohen, and their father; but on the
part of. the defendant, it was contended by his countel, that,
by reason of the said alienism of the said mother of the said
Philip Jacobs, and his said maternal uncle, the said estate did
not descend and come to Bella Cohen and Ahina Mordecai;
and upon this question, which thus occurred before the said
court, the opinions of the said judges were opposed; and upon
request of the counsel for the plaintiff, the poipt on which said
disagreement happened is stated as above set fQrth, under the
direction of the said judges, ih order to be certified to the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case' was argued by Mr Hoffman for the lessors of the
plaintiffs, and by Mr Wirt for the defendants.
Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes before the court upon a certificate of division
of opinion of the jqdges of the circuit court for the southern
district of New York, in a case stated in a special verdict.
Philip Jacobs, an American citizen, died in 1818 seised of
certain real estate in the state of New York, having made his
last will and testament; but the land in controversy in the present suit (which is -an ejectment) is supposed by the plaintiff
to.be intestate estate.. Two of the lessors of the plaintiffs,
Bella Cohen and Rhina Mordecai are citizens of South Carolina, and claim to be the heirs at law of the testator and of his

JANUARY TERM 1822.
[Lessee of Lev, et al. v. M'Cartee.]

posthumous child, and as such are entitled to the premises.
They are the children of Moses Cohen, who was the son of
Leipman Cohen, an alien, and the maternal uncle of the testator, and as such claim to be his next of kin. The mother of
the testator (who was also an alien) and the said Leipman
Cohen and Moses Cohen are dead. The testator died, leaving
his wife pregnant, who was afterwards delivered of a posthumous child, who died in infancy in 1821, and who took certain estate under the will, not now material to be mentioned.
Under these circumstances the question arises, whether the said
lessors of the plaintiffs, notwithstandingthp alienage of the intermediate ancestors through whom they make their pedigree,
are capable of taking the premises by descent iform the tustator
or his posthumous child, as heirs at law under the laws of New
York; and this is the question upon which the judges in the
court below were divided in opinion. It resolves itself into
this; whether one citizen can inherit in the collateral line to
another, when he must make his pedigree or title through a
deceased alien ancestor.
The question is one of purely local law, and as such, must
be decided by this court. By the thirty-fifth article of the
constitution of New York of 1777, it was ordained and declared, ",that such parts of the common law of England, and
of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the
acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together
did form the law of the said colony on the 19th of April 1775,
shall be and continue the law of this state, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this state shall from
time to time make concerning the same." By the statute of
11 and 12 William III. chap. 6, it is enacted, "that all and
every person or persons, being the king's natural born subject
or subjects, within any of the king's realms or dominions,
shall and may hereafter lawfully inherit and be inheritable as
heir or heirs, &c., and make their pedigrees and titles by descent
from any of their ancestors, lineal or collateral, although the
fathei and mother, or fathers and mothers, or other ancestor
of such person or persons, by, from, through, or under whom
he, she or they shall or may make or derive their title or
pedigree, were pr was, or is or are, or shall be born out of the
king's allegiance, &c. as freely, &c. as if such father, &c. or

SUPREME COURT.
[Lessee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.]

other ancestor, &c. &c. had been naturalized or natural born
subjects, &c."
It has been argued at the bar that this statute of William III.
extending to all his subjects, within all his dominions, constituted a part of the statute law of England which was in force,
and formed a part of the law of New York in the year 1775;
and as such was recognized by the constitution of New York.
But, assuming for the sake of the argument that this is so, still
the inquiry will remain, whether it was in force in New York
at the time of the present descent cast; for if it was at that time
repealed, it has no bearing on the present case. By an act of
the legislature of New York, passed on the 27th of February
1788, chap. 90, sect. 38, itis enacted, "that none of the statutes of England or Great Britain shall be considered as laws
of this state." And by the statute of descents of New York,
of thc 23d of February 1786, chap. 12, it is enacted "that in
all cases of descents not particularly provided for by this act,
the common law shall govern." These statutes were in full
force at the time of the descent cast in the present case; and of
course govern the rights of the parties,
It has been argued, that the reference to the common law in
the statute of descents of 1786, includes not only the common
law properly so called, but the alterations and amendments
which had been made in it by British statutes antecedent to the
American revolution; and that the repeal of the British statutes
by the act of 1788 repealed them only as statutes, but left them.
in full vigour and operation so far as they then constituted a
part of the law of New York: thus making them in some sort
a part of its common law. We cannot yield to the argument
in either respect. Te legislature must be presumed to use
words in their known and ordinary signification, unless that
sense be repelled by the context. The common law is constantly and: generally used in contradistinction to statute law.
This very distinction is pointed out in the clause of the constitution of New York, already cited, "such parts of the cormon
law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great
Britain, and of the acts, &c. which did form the lavr of the
said colony on the 19th of April 1775, shall continue the law
of the state." It is too plain for argument, that the common
law is here spoken of in its appropriate sense, as the un-

JANUARY TERM 1832.
rLessee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.]

written law of the land, independent of statutable enactments.
The same meaning must be applied to it in the act respecting descents of 1786. That Sct propounds a scheme of descents varying in many respects from the common law; and
then provides that in all cases of descent, not provided for by
the act, the common law shall govern. If it had been intended
to recognize any statute enactments of England, we should
naturally expect to find some clear expression of such an intention by some appropriate words. None such are given; and
it is therefore not to be doubted, that the common law canons
of descent were referred to, and made the basis of descent in
all cases not otherwise positively provided for. In England,
the canons of descent by the common law are never confounded with descents specially authorised by statute: .and the statute of New York refers not to any peculiar law of that state,
then existing; but to the common origin of our jurisprudence,
the common law of England.
There is still less reason for giving the meaning contended
for to the repealing clause of the act of 1788; for that would
be a plain departure from the very words of the act, without
any necessity for such a construction. The words are "that
nlone of thestatutesof England, &c., shall be considered as laws
of this state." The "statutes of England" can mean nothing
else but the acts of parliament. The object was not to repeal
some existing laws, but to repeal laws then in force in New
York. It would be almost absurd to suppose that the act
meant to repeal the statutes of England, which had no operation whatever in that state. What were the British statutes
then in force? plainly those referred to, and continued in force
by the thirty-fifth article of the constitution already quoted.
The repeal then was co-extensive with the original adoption of
them. In any other view of the matter, this extraordinary
consequence would follow, that the legislature could solemnly
perform the vain act of repealing, as statutes, what, in the
same breath, it confirmed as the common law of the state; that
it would propose a useless ceremony; and by words of repeal
would intend to preserve all the existing laws in full force.
And this, it may be added, it would be doing at the same time,
by contemporaneous legislation, at the same session, as well as
in the same act, it was revising, and incorporating into the text

SUPREME COURT.
[Lessee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.3

of its own laws, many of the provisions of the old English statutes, which had previously been, by adoption, a part of its
jurisprudence. Such a course of proceeding would be consistent and intelligible, and in harmony with a design to repeal all the English statutes which were not revised and
re-enacted; but it -would be unintelligible and inconsistent
with a design to retain them all as a part of its own common
law.
We think, then, that the statute of William II. constituted
no part of the law of New York at the time when the present
descent was cast; and that the case must rest for its .decision
exclusively upon the principles of the common law. The
residue of this opinion will, therefore, be exclusively confined tb the consideration of the common law applicable to it.
In order to clear -the way for a more exact consideration
of the subject, it may be proper to take notice of some few
distinctions in regard to descents, which are of frequent occurrence in the authorities. Descents are,,as is well known,
of two sorts; lineal, as from father or grandfather to son or
grandson', and collateral as from brother to brother, and cousin
to cousin,. &c. They are also distinguished into mediate and
immediate descents. But, here, the terms are susceptible of
different interpretations; which circumstance has introduced
some confusion into legal discussions, since different judges
have used them in different senses: A descent may be said to
be mediate or immediate, in regard to the- mediate or immediate descent of the estate or right; or it may be said to be
mediate or immediate, in regard to the mediateness or immediateness of the pedigree, or degrees of consanguinity.
Thus, a descent from the grandfather, who dies in possession,
to the grandchild (the father being then dead), or from the uncle
to the nephew (the brother being dead), is in the former sense
in law an immediate descent, although the one is collateral and
the other lineal, for the heir is in the per, and not in theper
and cui. And this, in the opinion of Lord Chief Justice Bpidgman, Collingwood v. Pace, Bannister's Rep. of Sir 0. Bridgman,410, 418, is the true meaning and appreciation of the terms.
So they are used by Lord Coke in his first Institute, Co. Litt.
10, b. On the other hand, with reference to the line of pedigree or consanguinity, a descent is often said to be immediate,

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Lessee of Levy et at. v. W'Cartee.]

when the ancestor, from whom the party derives his blood, is
immediate, and without any intervening link or degrees, and
mediate when the kindred is derived from him mediante atero, another ancestor intervening between them. Thus, a
descent in lineals from father to son is, in this sense, immediate; but a descent from grandfather to grandson (tle father
being dead), or from uncle to nephew (thebrother being dead),
is deemed mediate; the father and the brother being in these
latter cases the medium deferenrs as it is called, of the descent or'consanguinity. And this is the sense in which Lord
Hale uses the words, assigning as a reason, that he calls it a
mediate descent, because the father or brother ia the medium,
through or by whom the son or nephew derives his title to
the grandfather or uncle. Collingwood v. Pace, 1 Vent. 413,
415. S. C. 1 Keble, 671. And in this sense the words are
equivalent to mediate and immediate ancestors. In the great
case of Collingwood v. Pace, upon which we shall hereafter
comment at large, these distinctions were insisted on by the
learned judges already referred to with much particularity; and
they will help us to understand the reasoning of the court with
more readiness- and accuracy. We shall constantly use the
words in the sense adopted by Lord Hale.
That an alien has no inheritable blood, and can neither take
'land himself by descent, nor transmit land from himself to
others by descent, is common learning, and requires no reasoning to support it. If we were to trust to the doctrines promulgated by elementary writers, it is no less true that alienage
in any mediate ancestor will interript the descent between
persons who are capable of taking and transmitting land by
descent. It is so laid down in Comyn's Digest (Alien C. I.),
a work of rare excellence and accuracy; and in Bacon'sAbridgement (Alien, C.): and it is implied in the text of Blackstone's
Commentaries (2 Black. Comm. 250), where the only exception admitted is of a descent from brother to brother. Lord
Coke, in his First Institute, Co. Litt. 8, a, says, that "if an
alien cometh into England and bath issue two sons, these two
sons are indigenw, subjects born, because they are born within
the realm: and yet if one of them purchase lands in fee and dieth
without issue, his brother shall not be his heir, for there was
never any inheritable blood between the father and them; and
VOL. VI.-P

SUPREME COURT.
[Lessee of Levy et aL. v. M'Cartee.]

where the sons, by no possibility, can be heirs to the father, the
one of them shall not be heir to the other." The case put by
Lord Coke of a descent from brother to brother afterwards became an exceedingly vexed question, and was finally resolved
in the case of Collingwood v. Pace in favour of the descent
from brother to brother by seven judges against three, on
deliberate argument before all the judges in the exchequer
chamber upon an adjournment of the cause from the common
pleas. All the judges gave seriatim opinions; but the whole
case turned upon the point, whether the descent was to be considered as mediate or immediate. Three judges (Lord Chief
Justice Bridgman, and Tyrrel, J. and Keeling, J.) were of opinion that the descent from brother to brother was not immediate, but mediate through the father (mediante patre); the
other judges were of opinion that by the common law the descent from brother to brother was immediate, and not through
the father, as a medium deferens. The case is reported in various books, and in all of them, considering its magnitude and
importance, in a very imperfect and unsatisfactory manner.
The original arguments and opinions in the common pleas are
given in 1 Keble's Reports, 65; and in the exchequer chamber
in 1 Keble, 174, et seq. 216, 265,538, 579, 588, 603, 670,699,
in 2 Siderfin's Rep. 193, and.very briefly in I Levin's Rep.
59, S. C. Hard. Rep. 224. The opinion of Lord Hale is
reported at large in 1 Ventris's Rep. 413; and Mr Bannister,
in his excellent edition of the judgments of Lord Chief Justice
Bridgman (Bannister's Rep. 410, 414), has, recently, and for
the first time, given us the opinion of this eminent judge from
his own manuscript. It is a most luminous and profound argument, and contains a large survey of the whole doctrine of
alienage. In this opinion the special verdict is set forth, and
thus gets us rid of some of the obscurities thrown upon it in
the former reports. The substance of the facts is as follows:
Robert Ramsay, an alien, born in Scotland before the accession
of the crown of England to king James, had issue four sons,
aliens; viz. Robert, Nicholas, John, afterwards earl of Itchderness, and naturalized by an act of parliament in 1 Jac. I. and
George, naturalized by an act of parliament, 7 Jac. 1. who
afterwards had issue John, the plaintiff's lessor, born in England.
Nicholas had issue Patrick, born in England in

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Lessee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.]

1618, who had issue William, born in England, who was
then living. John, the earl, hav~ig purchased the rectory of
Xingston in question in the case, died seised thereof, without
issue, in January, 1 Car. I. (1625). Afterwards, in July 1636,
George died, leaving issue the said John, the lessor of the
plaintiff; afterwards, in May 1638, Nicholas died, leaving the
said Patrick his only son living. It did not appear when Robert the eldest son died; but he left three daughters, all aliens
born, then living. The question was, whether John, the lessor
of the plaintiff, the son of George, would take the premises as
heir by descent to the earl, his uncle; or for want of an heir the
rectory should escheat to the crown. In the argument of the
case by the judgeswe are informed,both by Lord Hale and Lord
Bridgman, that three things were agreed to as unquestionable
by all of them.
1. That neither the daughters of Robert,
the son of Robert, being aliens, nor Patrick, the son of Nicholag, though born in England, can inherit, because his father,
through whom he must convey his pedigree, was an alien.
2. That as the estate cannot descend to them, so neither do
any of them stand in the way to hinder the descent to George.
The difference bath been. often put between the case of a son
or brother, aliens, who are in law as non-existentes, and the
brotler or son of a person attainted, as to this point. 3. That
there is no difference between the descent to George and the
descent to John his son, the lessor of the plaintiff, who, jure
representationis, is the same with the father. If George, having survived John, the earl, niight have inherited the estate,
so will John, the son, who represents him. So that the pointof
the case came to this, whether, if two brothers of alien parents,
one naturalized by acts of parliament, and the one purchaseth
lands and dies; the lands shall descend to the other. And so
it is put by Lord Bridgman and Lord Hale.
In regard to Patrick, the son of Nicholas, it is material to
observe, that as Nicholas survived John, the earl, he would,
except for his being an alien, have been capable to inherit the
latter. But, being alive, he would intercept the descent to'
Patrick, who was a native born subject, according to the principles of the common law stated by this court in M'Henry v.
Somerville, 9 Wheat. Rep. 354. The learned judges, however, in Collingwood-v. Pace, take no particular notice of the

SUPREME COURT.
fLessee of Levv et al. v. M'Cartee.]

fact that Nicholas was 'i~'iug at the death of John, the earl;
but treat the case exactly an the same manner as if he had been
then dead; and apparently rely on no distinction as arising
from that fact. But George, the brother of John, the earl,
survived him, and being a naturalized subject, was capable of
taking by descent from him, unless the alienage of his father
Robert (whether dead or living) interrupted the descent: and
John, the lessor of the plaintiff, jure representationis, derived
his title directly from his father.
Having stated these preliminaries, which are necessary for a
more clear understanding of the case, it may be lidded, that the
case furnishes conclusive evidence, that by the common law, in
all cases of mediate descents, if any mediate ancestor through
whom the party makes his pedigree, as heir, is an alien, that is a
bar to his title as heir, for the reasons stated by Lord Coke,
that such an alien ancestor can communicate no inheritable
blood. This was admitted by all the judges, as well by those
who were in favour of the lessor of the plaintiff, as by those
who argued the other way. It was necessarily the doctrine
of the latter, for they held the alienage of the father a good
bar to the descent, deeming a descent from brother to-brother
to be a mediate descent only, mediante patre: on the other
hand, the seven judges who were for the lessor of the plainff, admitted the general doctrine, but contended that it did
not apply to the case of a descnt from brother to brother, because it was an immediate descent. And this constituted the
whole controversy between them; that is, whether the descent
was mediate or immediate. It will be our business to demonstrate this by passages from the opinions of Lord Bridgman
and Lord Hale, who took opposite sides in the argument.
Their opinions are given it large, and in an authentic form:
those of the *otherjudges, who agreed with them respectively,
are given by the reporters in a very abridged and loose manner: but all of them manifestly assume the same general basis
of reasoning on this point, as will appear by referring to their
opinions in 2 Siderfin's Rep. 193, and 1 Keble's Rep. 579,
585, 603, 670, 699.

In the first place we will begin with Lord Hale. He says,
"in immediate descents, there can be no impediment but what
arises in the parties themselves. For instance, the father

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Lessee of Levy eta]. v. M'Cartee.]

seised of lands, the impediment that hinders the descent must
be either in the father or the son; as if the father or the son
be attaint or an alien. In medite" (printed immediate by
mistake as the context shows) "descents, a disability of being
an alien, or attaint in him, that I call a medius ancestor, will
disable a person to take by descent, though he himself hath
no such disability. For instance in lineal descents; if a father
be attaint or be an alien, and bath issue a denizen born, and
dies in the life of the grandfather, the grandfather dies seised;
the son shall not take, but the land shall escheat. In collateral
descents, A. and B. brothers; A. is an alien or attainted, and
bath issue to a denizen bori;* B., purchaseth lands and dies
without issue, C. shall not inherit; for A., which was the medius ancestor, or medium deferens of this descent, was incapable. And this is very apparent in this very case; for by
this means Patrick, though a denizen born, and the son of an
elder brother, is disabled to inherit the earl. A. and B. brothers; A. is an alien or person attainted, and bath issue C. and
dies, and C. purchaseth lands and dies without issue; B., his
uncle, shall not inherit for the reason beforegoing; for. A. is a
medius, which was disabled. And if in our case Patrick, the
son of Nicholas, although a denizen born, had purchased lands
and died 'without issue, John, his uncle, should not have inherited him, by reason of the disability of Nicholas; and yet
Nicholas himself, had he not been-an alien, could not immediately have inherited to his son, but yet he is a block in the
way of John." Collingwood v. Pace, I Vent. 415, 416; S. P.
Id. 419, 423. See also S. C. I Keble, 671, &c. These passages distinctly establish the doctrine contended for in all cases
of mediate descents in the sense given to these-terms by Lord
Hale: that is, that an alien mediate ancestor through whom the
party must claim, is a bar to the descent. The cases put of a
descent from grandfather to grandton, the father being an alien
and dead; and of a descent from an uncle to a nephew, the
brother being an alien and dead; are direct to the point, and
are put as unquestionable. Lord Hale also cites in illustration

0 The word "denizen" is used in the common law in a double sense. It
sometimes means a natural born subject; and sometimes a person who, being an
alien, has been denizenized by letters patent of the crown. Co. Litt. 129,a. Id.
8 a. Com. Dig. Alien, D. Bannistfi's Rep. 433.

SUPREME COURT.
v. M'Cartee.]
[Lessee of Levy et al.

of this doctrine, Grey's case, Dyer's Rep. 274, and Courtney's
case, cited I Vent. 425, Bannister's Rep. 452, Both of
tHese were cases of attaint in the mediate ancestor creating an
incapacity to inherit; and although in some cases there is a
difference between alienage and attaint, where the claim is not
through the ancestor, yet where the claim is through him there
is no difference. The disability equally applies to each, and
breaks the inheritance. Lord Hale takes notice of this distinction in another part of his argument, in speaking of the disability of an alien, which is' general or original to himself in
reference to inheritance; and where it is a consequential or
consecutive disability, that reflects to an alien from one that
must derive by or through him, though he perchance be a
natural born subject. Thus he says, "in respect to this incapacity (personal), he doth resemble a personal attaint; yet with
this difference. The law looks upon a person attaint as one
that it takes notice of; and therefore the eldest son attaint, overliving his father, though 7ie shall not take by descent in respect
of his disability, yet he shall hinder the descent of the younger
son. But if the eldest son be an alien, the law takes no notice
of him; and therefore, as he shall not take by descent, so he
shall not impede the descent to his younger brother. A consequential consecutive disability, that reflects to an alien from
one that must derive by or through him, though he perchance
be a natural born subject (doth impede).* As in our case,
though Patrick the son of Nicholas be a natural' born subject,
yet because Nicholas his father was an alien, there is a consecutive impediment derived upon Patrick, whereby he is consequentially disabled to inherit John his uncle: ahd this consecutive disability is parallel to that which we call corruption of
blood, which is a consequent of attainder. If the father be
attainted, the blood of the grandfather is not corrupted; no, nor
the blood of his son; though he could not inherit him, but only
t e blood of the father. But that corruption of blood in the
father draws a consequential impediment upon the son to inherit the grandfather; because the father's corruption of blood
obstructs the transmission of the hereditary descent between
the grandfather and the son." 1 Vnt. 417, 418.
* These words are not found in Vent. 417; but the immediate context shows
that they are omitted by mistake, and the sentence is left imperfect.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[Lessee of Levy etal. v. WCartee.]

Lord Hale afterwards proceeds to state the reasons why,
notwithstanding the general rule, he was of opinion that in
the case at bar, George, and by parity of reasoning, his sort
John, the lessor of the plaintiff, could inherit to the earl.
"M y first reason," says he, "is because the descent from
brother to brother, though it be a collateral descent, yet it is
an immediate descent; and consequently, upon what has been
premised at first, unless we can find a disability or impediment
in them, no impediment in another ancestor will hinder the
descent between them." 1 Vent. Rep. 423. He then proceeds to establish his doctrine, that it is an immediate descent,
and that in this respect it differs from all other collateral descents whatsoever. He then adds, "if the father, in case of
a descent between brothers. were such an ancestor as the law
looks upon as a medium that derives the one descent from the
other, then the attainder of the father would hinder the descent
between the brothers. But the attainder of the father doth
not hinder the descent between the brothers: therefore the
father is not such a medium or nexus as is looked upon by
law as the means deriving such descent between the two brothers."
1 Vent. Rep. 425.
These passages
from Lord Hale's opinion have been cited
the more at large because they afford a satisfactory answer to
the argument at the bar, as to the incongruity and inconclusiveness of his reasoning; and establish beyond controversy,
that in his opinion the common law interrupted the descent
wherever a mediate ancestor was either an alien or attaint; and
that the case of a descent from brother to brother was excepted
because the descent was immediate.
Let us now proceed in the next place to the opinion of Lord
Iridgman. He' begins by stating the very same proposition
as lord Hale. "It hath been inferred," says he, "that in
immediate descents there can be no impediment but What
ariseth in the parties themselves. But in mediate descents, it
is agreed, the disability of being an alien, or attainted in him
that is the medius antecessor, will disable the other, though he
have no such disability. And therefore Patrick here, though
born in England, cannot inherit John his uncle, nor John to
him, by reason of the disability of Nicholas, the medius antscessor. But it is said that the descent from brother to brother,

120

SUPREME COURT.
[Lessee of Levy et al. v. M'Cartee.]

though it be a collateral descent, yet it is an immediate descent,
and so no impediment could hinder a descent between themn.
Bannister's Rep. 418, 436. And the whole of his argwment
is then employed in an attempt to disprove that the descent
between brothers is by the common law immediate, and in
affirming the dbctrine of Lord Coke in Co. Litt. 8 a. for the
same reason, viz. there is no inheritable blood between them,
otherwise than mediante patre. Bannister's Rep. 437, 442,
443, 445, 460. It is unnecessary to go over that reasoning,
because it proceeds upon the ground as conceded and clearly
established in the common law, there can be no title made by
descent, where there is a mediate alien ancestor, unless it be
the case of a descent from brother to brother.
The case of Collingwood v. Pace; then, does conclusively
establish the doctrine of the common law to be, by the admissibn of all the judges, that if -the, pedigree must be traced
through a-mediate alien ancestor, the party cannot take by descent, for the inheritable blood is stopped, and there is a flat
bar to the assertion .of any title derived through the alien; so
that the elementary writers are fully borne out in their assertions on this subject. See Com. Dig. Alien, C. Bac. Abridg.
Alien, C. Cruise's Dig. tit. 29, chap. 2, sect. 20. York on
Forfeiture, 72. 3 Salk. 129. Doe d. Durorere v. Jones, 4
Term Rep. 300.
The preamble to the statute of 11 and 12 William III. ch.
6, also affards strong evidence of the antecedent state of the
law on this point; and that the statute is remedial; and not, as
has been argued at the bar, in any respect declaratory. It is
in the following words: "whereas divers persons born within
the king's dominions are disabled to inherit, and make their
titles by descent from their ancestors, by reason that their
father or mother, or some other ancestor by whom they are to
derive their descent, was an alien, and not born within the
king's dominions, for remedy whereof," &c.
Here, the disability to inherit and make title is plainly stated
to exist; not that there is a doubt upon the subject; and the disability is stated to arise from the fact, that the acestur by
whom they are to derive their descent is an alien; not that the
ancestor from whom they derive their title to the estate is an
alien; and a remedy is therefore provided. to meet that which

JANUARY TERM 1832.
,Lessee of Levy et a]. v. M'Cartee.]

was deemed the only inconvenience, a descent through a mediate alienancestor.
Upon the clear result, then, of the English authorities, we
should be of opinion, even if there were no further lights on
the subject, that the alienage of the mediate ancestors in the
present case, would be a bar to the recovery of the plaintiff.
But the same doctrine will be found fully'recognized by Mr
Chancellor Kent in his learned Commentaries, with the additional declaration, that the statute of William III. had never
been adopted in New York; though he very properly admits
that the enlarged policy of the present day would naturally incline us to a benignant interpretation of the law of descents, in
favour of natural born citizens; who were obliged to deduce a
title to land from a pure and legitimate source, through-an alien
ancestor. 2 Kent's Comm. 47, 48, 49. See also Jackson v.
Lunn, 3 John. Cas. 109, 121. The case of Jackson v. Wood,
7 Jnhns. Rep. 289, 297, has not the slightest bearing on the
subject. It decided no more than that an Indian was incapable
of passing a title to lands in New York, without the consent of
the legislature; or in any other manner than is provided for by
the laws of the state. The case of Jackson v. Jackson, 7 Johns.
Rep. 213, turned upon the known distinction, that an alien
who cannot inherit, shall not p,,vent the descent to a citizen,
who can make title as heir,'not through the alien, but aside
from hith; as in the common case in England, of a younger
brother inheriting from his father, though he has an elder brotber living, who is an alien.
But there is a very recent decision in the state of New York,
not yet in print, which is direct to the point now before us.
It is the case of Jackson v. Green, decided by the supreme
court of that state in 1831. We have been favoured with a
manuscript copy of th opinion delivered by the court on that
occasion. The queston in that case was, whether one ndturalized citizen could take by descent from another naturalized
citizen, who was his cousin; the pedigree being to be made
through alien anccstors. It was held that he could not. The
court fullyrecognized the distinction already adverted to between mediate and immediate descents; holding that an alien
ancestor, through whom the pedigree must be traced, intercepted the descent, and produced a fatal bar to the recovery.

A certificate will be sent to the circuit court, that the lessors
of the plaintiff, Bella Cohen and Rhina Mordecai, were not
capable of taking by descent the premises described in the
special verdict in the case, whereof the said Philip Jacobs
died seised, as therein stated, as heirs at law of the said Philip
Jacobs; by reason of the alienage of the mother of the sa:d
Philip Jacobs, and his maternal uncle, Leipman Cohen, and
their father: the lessors of the plaintiff deriving their pedigree
and title by descent through mediate alien ancestors. * Certificate accordingly.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the southern
district of New York, and on the point and question on which
the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion,
and which was certified to this Court for its opinion agreeably
to the act of congress in such cases made and provided, and
was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is the
opinion of this Court, that the lessors of the plaintiff, Bella
Cohen, and Rhina Mordecai, were not capable of taking by
descent the premises described in the special verdict in the
-case, whereof the said Philip Jacobs died seised, as therein
stated, as heirs at law of the said Philip Jacobs, by reason of
the alienage of the mother of the said Philip Jacobs and his
maternal uncle, Leiiman Cohen, and his father; the lessors of
the plaintiff deriving their pedigree and title by descent through
mediate alien ancestors. Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this tourt, that it be certified to the judges of the
said circuit court that the lessors of the plaintiff, Bella Cohen
and Rhina Mordecai, were not capable of taking by descent
* Note. It may not be useless to state, that the title of the parties in Coilingwood v. Pace underwent judicial examination and decisioi, at three different periods. The first was in Foster v. Ramsay in the upper bench, during the commonwealth, 1657-1659, and is reported in 1 Siderfin's Rep. 28, 51,148, and cited
in Bannister's Rep. 447. The second was Collingwood v. Pace, brought in
1656, but not finally decided until many years afterwards. The third was Crane v.
