SUPREME COURT.

Louis M'LANE, EXECUTOR OF ALLEN M'LANE, DECEASED,
CLAIMANT

OF A

MOIETY OF THE FORFEITURE OF THE

SHIP GOOD FRIENDS, APPELLANT v. THE UJNITED STATES.
The ship Good Friends, and her cargo of British merchandise, owned by Stephen
Girard a citizen of the United States, was seized by the collector of the
Delaware district, on the 19th of April 1812, for a violatiori of the non-intercourse laws of the United States, then in force. The ship and cargo were
condemned as forfeited, in the district and circuit court of the Delaware district. On the 29th July 1813, congress passed an "'act for the relief of the
owners of the Good Friends, &c.," and a remibpion of the for(eiture was
granted by the sec:etary of the treasury, under the authority of that act, with
the exception ofa sum equal to the double duties imposed byan act of congress passed on the 1st of July 1812. The collector was efhtitled to one moiety
of the whole amount reserved by the secretary of the treasury, as the condition
of the remission.
Where a sentence of condemnation has been finally pronounced in a case of
seizure, this court, as an incident to the possession of the principal cause, hs
a right to proceed to decree a distribution of the proceeds, according to the
terms prescribed by law. And it is a familiar practice to institute proceedings
for the purpose of such distribution, whenever a doubt occurs as to the rights of
the parties, who are entitled to share in the distribution.
The duty of the collector in superintending the collection of the revenue, and of
making seizures for supposed violations of law, is onerous and full of perplexity.
If he seizes any goods, it is at his own peril; and he is condemnable in dama.
ges and costs, if it should turn out upon the final adjudication, that there was
no probable cause for the seizure. As a just reward for his diligence, and a
comperation for his risks; at onde to stimulate his vigilance and secure his
activity; the laws of the United States have awarded to him a large share of the
proceeds of the forfeiture. But his right by the seizure is but inchoate; ant
although the forfeiture may havebeen justly incurred, yet the government has
reserved to itself the right to release it, either in whole or in part, until the
proceeds have been actually received for distibutios; anid in that event, and to
that extent, it displaces the right of the collector. Such was the deisioli of
this court in the case of the United States v. Mori is, 10 Wheaten, 246.
But whatever is reserved to the government out of the forfeiture, is reseived as
well for the seizing officer as for itself; and is distributable accoidingly. The
government has no authority, under its existing laws, to release the collector's
-share as such, arid yet to retain to itself the other part of the forfeiture.
In point of law, no duties, as sucs, can legally accrue upon the importation of
prohibited goods. They are not entitled to entry at the custom house, or to
be bonded. They are, ipso facto, forfeited by the msere act of importation.

States for the district of Delaware.

"On motion of C. A. Rodney, on behalf of Colonel A.

of the forfeihtre decreed by the court, of which the said A.
M'Lane claims one full moiety of the whole exacted from, and
paid by the claimant, the following statement of facts is agreed
to, and submitted to the court by the counsel on both sides:
"The ship Good Friends, laden with the cargo above stated
consisting of goods, wares, and merchandise, of British growth,
produce or manufacture, was seizcd) as prohibited, by the said
A. M'Lane, collector as aforesaid, vthin the distritt'aforesaid, on the 19th ofApril 1812, for a violation of the acts of
congrQss, in such case made and provided: the said ship and
cargo were afterwards libelled, and prosecuted to condemnation, in.the district court of the Delaware district; and the sentence of that court was. afterwards affirmed on appeal by a decree of the circuit court, from which decree an appeal was not
prosecuted.

the relief of the ovyners of the ships called the Good Friends,
the Amazon, and the United States, and their cargoes, and also
of Henry Bryce, passed the 29th July 1813, upon the petition
of Stephen Girard, claimant of the cargo of the ship Good
Friends as aforesaid, a remission of the forfeiture was granted
by.the'secretary of the treasury, with the exception of a sum
equal to the amount of the double duties imposed by an act of
congress passed on the 1st of July 1812: that the said sum
was afterwards paid by the said S. Girard, to C. J. Ingersoll,
district attorney of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania.
"ThcAt it has been decided by the treasury department, that
the said Allen. M'Lane is entitlekl to one moiety of the additional duties imposed by the act of 1st July aforesaid, on goods
not prohibited, and which is therefore undisputed, but not to a
full moiety of the whole sum exacted from the said S. Girard,

as aforesaid, insists that he is legally and justly entitled to one
full moiety of the whole amount paid as aforesaid, considering

it all as forfeiture; inasmuch as the cargo of the ship Good
Friends consisted entirely )f goods prohibited, and not subject
to any duty; and that whatsoever portion was not remitted is to
be considered as forfeiture; and that, as the sum exacted is
one and indivisible, he.is entitled to a full moiety of it.
"It is further agreed, that a decreepro forma be entered
on this motion against the said A. M'Lane, for the purpose of
bringing this question before the supreme court of the United
States for final decision; and that an appeal be entered, in due
form, from such decree, and that this statement of facts, with
the records, exhibits, depositions and documents herein referred to, be transmitted to the sai4 supreme court for hearing,
at the ensuing term."
The particular f6cts referred to in the statement, appeared at
large on- the record of the proceedings in the district and circuit courts. The following are abstracted from the record:
The seizure was made on the 19th of April 1812, at New
Castle, in the state of Delaware. The libel was filed on the
5th May 1812. The goods were appraised and delivered to
claimant upon bond, with sureties for the appraised value, the
9th May 1812. The decree of condemnation in the district
court, was given the 17th April 1813, and, the same day, an
appeal to the circuit court was entered.
This decree was affirmed in the circuit court on the 29th
September 1818; subject to the operation of the act of congress of 29th Fuly 1813, and the remission" of February 1813,
1814.

On the same day an appeal was entered to the Supreme
Court of the United States, which was not prosecuted.
In March 1812, Mr Girard presented a memorial to congress, praying for relief.
On the 29th July 1813, an act of cdngress was passed, of
which the following is a copy, to wit:
"An act for the relief of the owners of the ships called the
Good Friends, the Amazon, and the United States, and their
cargoes;, and also of Henry Bryce.

The district judge of the United States, for the district of
Delaware, certified the following statement of facts to the secre..
tary of the treasury of the United States, on the 25th NovemLier 1813.
"Having inquired into the facts stated in the annexed petition, after reasonable notice thereof had been given to the district attorney and the collector of Wilmington, 1 do find,
and cause to be stated to the secretary of the treasury of the
United States:
"1 . That Stephen Girard, the petitioner, is a citizen of the
United States, as stated in his petition.
"2. That the said petitioner is the owner of the ship Good
Friends and her cargo, and that he was the owner at the time
of the shipment of the cargo at Lond~n, and also at the time
of the arrival of the ship and cargo in the district of Delaware.
"3. That the said ship and cargo arrived in the said district
of Delaware, before the declaration of war, to wit, in the month
of April 1812, and were thereupon seized and prosecuted, as
forfeited for a breach of the non-importation laws.
The following protest was presented by Allen I'Lane,

his own knowledge of the matter, seized and forfeited, and in
pursuance to instructions from the secretary of the treasury,

bearing date the 6th of May, A.D. 1812, libelled in tho 44itrict court, for the Delaware district, and afterwards condemned
as forfeited, by the sentence of the said court, whereby a right
to oue moiety or half part of the appraised value of the said
ship and cargo becafne vested in thesaid collector: it is cuggested and alleged by the said collector,, that the right and interest which thus vested in him by virtue of the said seizure,
forfeiture and sentenc of condemnation, in the said moiety of
the said ship and her cargo, was absolute and indefeasible, po
long as the said sentence of condemnation remained in forclo;
so that by no adt of congress, passed subsequently to the gaid
sentence of condemnation, could such his right or. interest be
affected, impaired or divested: and it is therefore insisted on
behalf of the said collector, protestingagainst the allowance of
the prayer of the said petition, or the said petitioner obtaining
the benefit thereof, that this court should not, by its certificate
or act upon" the said petition, impair or infringe the right of
the said collector in the said moiety of the said ship and cargo;
and to the end that this allegation and protest may appear, that
a copy thereof may be annexed to the honourable district
judge's certificate and act upon the said petition.
"And it is further suggested by the said collector, that the
act of congress, under which the petition is presented, was not
intended in its provisions to extend to any case in which a
seltence of condemnation had been rendered, but only to the
cases from Amelia Island, which were sub judice, and undecided at the time of passing it; and the case of the Good Friends
having been regularly prosecuted to condemnation before the
passing of the said act, it is thereupon ordered and directed by
his-honour the judge, that a copy of this suggestion be transmitted to the beretary of the treasury, with the certificate in
this case granted by this eburt."
The remission, by the secretary of*the treasury on the 24th
oi February 1814, was in these terms:
"To all to whom these, presents shall come, I, George

touching the forfeitures and penalties which, by reason of the
importation of certain merchandise in the said ship Good
Friends, have been incurred under a statute of the United
States, entitled ' an act to interdidt the commercial intercourse
between the United States, and Great Britaini and France and
their dependencies, and for other purposes,' and a statute entitled ' an act concerning the commercial intercourse between
the United States and Great Britain and France, and for other
purposes,' and the statute supplementary to the last mentioned statute, has been transmitted to the secretary of the
treasury, by the jqdge of the United States for the district of
Delaware, pursuant to the statute of the United States, entitled
'an act to provide for mitigating or remittin& the forfeitures,
penalties or disabilities accruing in certain cases therein mentioned,' and pursuant to two other statutes of the United
States, one of which is entitled, 'an act for the relief of the
owners of the ships called the Good Friends, the Amazon, and
the United States, and their cargoes, and also of Henry Bryce;'
and the other, which is therein referred to, is entitled 'an act
directing the secretary of the treasury to remit fines, forfeitures
and penalties in certain cases,' as by said statement of facts
and petition, remaining in the treasury d~partment of the
United States, may fully appear: and, whereas 1, the said
secretary of the treasury, have maturely considered the said
statement of fdcts and petition; and, whereas, it has been
proved to my satisfaction that the goods, wares and merchandise, by the importation whereof the forfeitures and penalties
aforesaid have been incurred, were, at the time of their shipment and importation, bona fide owned by a citizen of the
United States, and the said forfeitures and penalties were incurred, without wilful negligence or intention of fraud:
"Now, therefore, know ye, that I, the said secretary of the
treasury, in pursuance of the directions of the said act entitled,

Good Friends, the Amazon and the United States, and their

forfeitures incurred as aforesaid, upon the costs and charges
that have arisen, or may arise, being.paid, and on payment of
the duties, which would have been payable by law on the
goods, wares and merchandise imported in the said ship
Good Friends, if the same had been legally imported into the
United -States after the 1st day of July, one thousand eight
hundred and twelve; and also, do hereby direct the prosecution-or prosecutions, if any shall have been instituted for the
recovery thereof, to cease and be determined, on payment.of
the costs, charges and duties as aforesaid."
This case was argued by Mr Jones and Mr Sergeant for the
appellant: and by Mr Taney, attorney-general of the United
States, for the appellees.
By Mr Sergeant, for the appellant, it was contended; that the
decree of the circuit court ought to be reversed, and a decree
rendered in favour of the appellant; because the amount directed by, the remission to be paid to the United States was in
fact and in law a portion of the thing forfeited, or of the proceeds thereof; and was so directed and ordered by virtue of
the-power derived from the forfeiture; and therefore, the appellant is entitled to a full moiety thereof.
Was not the late Allen M'Lane entitled, and are not his
personal xepresentatives entitled to one equal moiety of what
was reserved by the government, out of the forfeiture of the
cargo of the ship Good Friends?
The. right to the moiety of what has been received, beyond
the amount of the single duties, is admitted. That matter is
disposed of, and finally decided.
The question, therefore, is, whether he is not entitled, also,
to a moiety of the residue, or of that sum which is equal in
amount to what are denominated the single duties. In other
words, whether the sum reserved is divisible, so that one part'
of it is to be dealt with and considered as forfeiture, and the
other part as not being forfeiture.
It is contended, and an endeavobr will be made to maintain,
that the whole is forfeiture, and to be dealt with and disposed
of accordingly. That there is no ground for a distinction to
the prejudice of the collector. That such distinction as has been
made is entirely arbitrary (mitiori sensu) and unwarranted,

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

Before proceeding to refer to the several acts of congress
upon this subject, it is necessary to state some dates.
The seizure was made by the collector, A. M'Lane, at New
Castle, in the state of Delaware, the 19th April 1812. The
libel was filed the 5th May 1812. The condemnation in the
district court was upon the 17th April 1813. The act of congress for the relief of the owner of the Good Friends was
passed on the 29th July 1813. The remission by the secretary of the treasury was granted upon the 24th February 1814.
The decree of condemnation was affirmed in the circuit court
the 29th September 1818. Mr M'Lane protested against the
remission on the 25th March 1813.
The several acts of congress material to the case, are, first,
the act of the 29th July 1813, which is set out in the case
agreed, 4 Laws U. S. 581. This act refers for the mode and
neasure of relief to the act of 29th January 1813. That is
found in 4 Laws U. S. 485. The difference between the cases
provided for by the act of 29th January 1813 and the present
case, is obvious. Those were cases of goods brought in after
the duties wera Ooubled; this case is one of goods brought in
before that period.
The other acts are the act doubling the duties, passed on the
1st July 1812, 4 Laws U. S. 459. The act of 29th January
1813 refers to the act for mitigating and remitting penalties,
of 3d March 1797, to be found in 2 Laws U. S. 585. The
difference between the acts of 1813 and the general act of
1797, consists in several very important particulars. 1. The
facts to be proved under the act of 1797, are not required to be
proved under these acts. 2. By the acts of 1813, no discretion
is given to the secretary of the treasury. 3. The terms of
remission are prescribed by the law, and not left to the secretiry, as by the act of 1797.
This act, 29th July 1813, is therefore neither more nor less
than a legislative remission, applying, retrospectively, to the
relief of forfeitures incurred before the passing of the act.
This is a most material circumstance, to be borne in mind
throughout the present case.
It was a relief in cases to which no existing power applied,
upon terms which no existing law prescribed. It was an act
of legislative grace and pardon, of a very peculiar character.

412

SUPREME COURT.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

As between the United States and the claimants, such an
exertion of power was well enough, -and is not to be complained of. As respects third persons, whose rights and interests were already vested, and were to be affected, it is another

question.
The acts under which the forfeiture in the case of the Good
Friends accrued, and the acts under which the rights of Colonel M'Lane became vested, were the following:
The first was the act of 1st March 1809, 4 Laws U. S.211,
sect. 4, 5. The act of 28th June 1809, sect. 1, 2, 4, 4 Laws
U. S. 237. The act of 1st May 1810, sect. 3, 4 Laws U. S.
305. The act of 2d March 1811, 4 Laws U. S.339. Under
these acts, all importationwas prohibited. No goods could
be entered, or become liable to duty. They were all subject
to seizure and condemnation.
By these acts it will be seen, that penalties and forfeitures
were to be imposed and distributed according to the provisions
of the ninety-first section of the act of the 2d March 1799.
That provision is in 3 Laws U. S. 136, sect. 91, page 223.
These are all the acts or parts of acts it is material now to
refer to.
The qiuestion, then, is upon the true interpretation and
meaning of the act of the 1st July 1812, keeping in view all
the acts and parts of acts already referred to? It is not necessary now to inquire into the general power of congress upon
the subject of forfeitures incurred. So far as respects the
property relinquished by the act, the-collector now acquiesces;
although he protested at thetime, and considered himself'very
much injured.
But as to that part which was not relinquished, but was retained by the United States, the question is upon the interpretation of the act, involving, quoad hoc, the power of congress.
Could congress, not only relinquish a part of the forfeiture incurred, to the prejudice of the collector's rights; but could
they also, of the portions reserved, give to the United States
a larger portion than to the collector? It is considered clear
that they could not.
,Bythe seizure, the collector had a right in the'property
seized, to the extent of one half, to be consummated by condemnation. Jones v. Shore, 1 Wheat. 462. Van Ness v.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
.[M'Lane v. The United States.]

Buel, 4 Wheat. 74. United States v. Morris, 10 Wheat.
246, 292, 293.
2. There existed no law which conferred upon the secretary
of the treasury, or upon any one else, a power of femission,
so as to imliair that right, or to prevent or diminish its enjoyment by the collector. It may be, that it was within the scope
of the president's power of pardon, though that is a questionable point. It has once been before this court (United States
v. Lancaster), but was not decided. It does not arise here,
for the pardoning power has not been interposed.
3. Congress have no such power, that is to operate by legislation upon pre.existing vested rights.
4. Wherever congress have legislated upon the subject of
remission, it has always been with a saving of pre-existing
rights. And such they have "lways considered to be the rights
acquired by seizure.
Of this there is the plainest evidence in the act of 5d March
1797, 2 Laws U. S. 585, sect. 3. Cited, United States v.
Morris, 10 Wheat 246. There is, also, plain evidence of this
in the act of 28th June 1509, 4 Laws U. S. 237, sect. 2.
There is very ppwerful evidence of this also in the fact,
tlfat every law creating penalties and forfeitures, gives a special pcwer of remission, piospectivel,. So that it may be said
to be the sense of the legislature, as it is of the judiciary, that
the right is vested by the seizure and prosecution, subject only
to such qualified power of remission as theu existed by' law.
Colonel M'Lane, the collector, rmight well contend, as he
did, that there was no power by subsequent legislation to touch
his share of the forfeiture. fie is fully sustained in it; for
such appears to be the uniform understanding, without exception.
5. Under the general law, the secretary of the treasury has
clearly no power to remit or relinquish the collector's part, eo
nomine. Margaretta, 2 Gall. 515.
6. No duties were by law payable upon these goods. No
duties could accrue upon them. Duties by law accrue, and
are payable only upon goods imported, according to law.
No duties are or can be payable upon goods brought in

contrary to law, and in violation of law. They cannot be,
.for the most obvious and conclusive reasons. Duties ac-

SUPREME CUUKi.
[M'Lane v..The United States.]

crue, not upon arrival in the United States, but upon arrival
at the, port of entry. United States v. Vowell, 5 Cranch,
368. Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch, 104. S. C. 1 Gall.
348.
But forfeiture to the United States also accrues, at latest,
immediately upon arrival in the United States, and before
arriving at the port of entry. No matter when the seizure
takes place, it has relation back to the time of offence committed, and overreaches a bona fide sale. This has been decided upon the very acts now in question. United States v.
'1960 Bags of Coffee, 8 Craneh, 398. United States v. The
Mars, 8 Craneh, 417. So, in Gelston v. Hoyt, 3 Wheat. 146,
311. "A forfeiture attaches in rem at the moment the offence
is committed, and the property is instantly divested." If it
be instantly divested as to the former owner, it is, of course,
instantly vested in the United States; but no duty is payable
upon goods belonging to the United States.
The goods in question, therefore, were never liable to duties.
Nb duties were by law payable upon them, and no duties could
be charged upon them. They could not be entered or bonded.
No duties accrued upon them. For, 1. They were not legally
imported 2. They were forfeited to the United States
before arrival in port, and before duties could accrue. 3. That
forfeiture was consummated by seizure, and conclusively
proved by condemnation. It overreached evety thing.
7. It'need only be added for the entire understanding of the
question, that in this forfeiture, accrued and perfected before
duties could accrue, the collector had by law a vested right to
a niciety. It was his by contract,as much as his salary; as a
part of the emoluments of his office;, or as a reward for his special exertions, exposure and sacrifice.
.fr these cases it was very well earned; it cost him great
labour, and exposed him to a contest with powerful adversaries. He stood alone against a host. No doubt it was subject to existing laws. No doubt it was subject to ,exiting
rights; but it was not subject to newp or subsequent laws; nor
to newly created, rights. One-half of whatever might be recovered, by the United States, belonged by law and by contract to the c9llector. The collector's part, as such, cannbt be
remitted. Niargaretta, 2 Gall. 522.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
v[M Lane v. The United States.i
It is not intended, however, to examine the general power
of congress, nor to ask this court to perform the invidious duty
of limiting an exercise of power by congress. Let it be admitted for the. present purpose, that congress can by a legislative remission, release the forfeiture, and disappoint the just
expectations of the .ollector, as an incident. Can congress do
still more? can congres reserve to the United States, a portion of th6 forfeiture, giving up entirely that of the collector?
The proposition is too extravagant to be admitted for a moment. The intention to do so, is too manifestly unjust to be
imputed. Respect for congress forbids the imputation.
Mark what the effect would be. The policy of these acts
of grace towards importers, is not to be questioned now.
But this is clear: it gave to the offenders the full-benefit of
the non-importation laws; at the expense of the rest of the
community. They had in effect the fruits of a monopoly.
The United States, too, are to reap a harvest. The collector
alone, who has toiled and suffered in the service, is to go unpaid and unrewarded. This ought not to be. This cannot be.
The treasury, it is admitted, has been properly cautious in
avoiding the responsibility of a decision of this question. A
court of justice experiences no such difficulty, and practises no
such caut on. It pronounces its judgments according to the
right. - pon the ground of right, it is asked, whence is any
such power derived, as that asserted for the United States?
This, then, was the state, of things when the act of July
1813 passed. No duties had accrued, or were payable. The
goods were forfeited, in fact and in law. The forfeiture was
fixedby the condemnation. The right to one half was 'by
law vested in the collector. An application was made to
congress for relief. Congress gave it by the act of July 1813.
What is the just and legal interpretation of that act?
'It is not necessary to remind the court, that such an interpretation is always to be given, if possible, as is consistent with
justice and the rightful power of the legislature. Nothing
but express vwords can extort a different construction, eVen
from an act of a parliament said to be omnipotent: still less of
an aut of a constitutional congress, whose power is limited by
written law, and by a cautious respect for the rights of the
citizen.

416

SUPREME COURT.
[MWLane v. The United States.]

What, then, is the true construction of the act in question?
1. There are no express words, it must be admitted, requir.
ing an unjust construction of the act, to the injury of the collector. 2. There is nothing which shows this to have been
the intention. But the contrary: for, 3. The reservation is
one and entire, without discrimination or distinction. The
whole reservation is of one character. It all derives its
efficacy from the same source; namely, forfeiture: giving up a
part, and retaining the rest by right of forfeiture. 4. The true
character of the act is that of relinquishment or remission of a
part. The title of the act, and all the provisions demonstrate
this.
It is proper here to notice an incident in the case, which
may perhaps appear, at first view, to have some influence upon
it. It seems that the goods were giverr up on bonds for the appraised value the '9th May 1812. The only authority for such
a delivery is that contained in the eighty-ninth section of the
act of 1799, 3 Laws U. S. 221.
On this it is to be observed; that it is no part of the case
stated. Why not, is obvious: for it was unauthorised by law.
The non-intercourse acts did not adopt this provision in the
collection law, expressly or impliedly. The reason of it was
that it did not apply. Goods were not importable under the
law. The treasury remonstrated against it.
2. If it had applied, it would not h.ave altered the question
of forfeiture, nor the question of distribution. They do not
depend upon the mode of proceeding. It is wholly disregarded by the act of 29th July 1813. That act takes up the
matter upon the original simple ground of forfeiture, without
regard to this proceeding. It fixes the forfeiture to be insisted upon in gross. It does not say "in addition" to duties.
It in fact, and in the plainest possible way, disregards that incident, and takes up the matter entirely de novo. If any thing
had previously been paid, it could only he a credit under this
act, whether paid as duties or otherwise. So the treasury construed it.
What, then, was the intention of the act? It was a just
and honest intention. To do justice to the country, and at
the Same time to do justice to the confessedly meritorious officer.
To give to the United States an amount equal to the duties

which would have accrued if the importation had been legal;
and to the collector, a like amount. The duties that would
have accrued were the single duties. The goods arrived before the duties were doubled.
What was the mode adopted to accomplish this purpose?
To fix a sum equal to twice the amount of duties. This
precisely accomplished the purpose. The mentton of" duties"
was merely a reference to fix the amount according to this
view.
It was not to charge duties, but only to ascertain a sum.
So it has been understood by the treasury. If any part was
"duty," the whole was duty. But the treasury has agreed that
one moiety was forfeiture, and that of that moiety the collector is entitled to one half. This concession (too plain to be
withheld) is an admission which inevitably goes to the whole:
for, as the reservation is one and entire, if any part was
forfeiture, the whole was forfeiture, and none was duty.
Upon any other construction, the United States would get
three-fourths, and the collector only one-fourth. He would
be stripped of his due proportion, even of the remnant that was
retained of that entire and large forfeiture of the whole cargo,
of which a moiety so clearly belonged to him.
On these grounds it is submitted that the title of the appellant is plain. The partnership between the United States and
the collector, established by law, continues throughout. It is
not to be supposed that when the United States, by their own
act, diminished the joint stock, without the consent and
against the remonstrances of the collector, to his great prejudice; they intended also by their own mere power, to do him
still further wrong by changing the proportions of interest in
what remained, and appropriating to themselves (at his exLess than
pense) the largest share of what remained.
"equality," cannot here be "equity."

The principles which regulate the case now before the court
have been decided in the case of the United States v. Morris,
10 Wheat. 289. The settlement by the treasury with the
owner of the Good Friends and her cargo, settles the case. Its
being a remission by an act of congress, does not change the
VOL. VI -3 C

SUPREME COURT.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

principles by which the case is governed. The remission does
not derive its authority from the act of congress of 1813; that
act was intended only to justify what might perhaps be doubtful. The power to remit existed prior to that act.
The ship Good Friends arrived in the Delaware in April
1812; and on the 1st of July of that year the act imposing
double duties was passed. The double duties were imposed as
a penalty; and this principle was assumed at the treasury and
acted upon in the case: but as to the single duties, they would
hare been due if the vessel had arrived after the 1st of July;
and as to these duties, the importation was treated as if it had
been legal. The settlement in the case of this ship was the
same with those which were made in similar cases.
An examination of the art of the 29th July 1813, will show
that it was not an act conferring new powers, but it gave relief
on the same terms as the act referred to; and we must look to
the law of July 1, 1812, to see what were the benefits intended to be conferred by the act of July 29, 1813, for the
relief of the owners of the ships Good Friends and Ama-,
zon, &c.

The remissions under the act of January 2, 1813, were
made on payment of the duties; and the act of July in favour
of the collector was intended t.o put this case on the same footing; except that an additional penalty is imposed by the act,
and the rights of parties must be determined by the act of
January 2, 1813. In all these cases they were forfeitures, and
within the power of the secretary of the treasury to remit; and
the act was passed on account of the magnitude of the case.
Cited the message of the president of the United States to congress of 4th March 1812; also the report of Mr Gallatin,
secretary of the treasury of 18th March 1812.
The importations against the non-intercourse laws at that
period are stated in the report of Mr Gallatin, to dinount to
about eighteen millions of dollars; and they would have given
duties to the amount of five millions. Mr Gallatin expressly
state;, that all these cases came under the remitting power of
the secretary of the treasury, but asked the interference of
congress. There was a report of a committee of congress
sanctioning the power of the secretary, but this was not adopted; and th law of January 2, 1823, originated from that circumstance.

JANUARY TERM, 1832.
[M'L.ne v.The United State.]

In all these cases seizures had been made, and the law put
the importations on the same footing as if they had been
legal, and the claims of the seizing officers were not regarded.
The whole course of proceedings at the treasury has been according to this construction. To change this construction
now, would unsettle millions; and the government would be
bound to refund one half of what was received as duties.
The case of the United States v. Morris: 10 Wheaton, 289,
was under the same non-intercourse law as that to the penalties of which the Good Friends was subjected. The remission
of the secretary of the treasury in that case reserved five hundred dollars, to be distributed among certain officers. The
seizure gives no absolute righ. to the seizing officer; but all is
subject to the power of the secretary of the treasury, to dispense with the forfeiture. on equitable principles. Upon a fill
examination of the questions in this casem, these positions may
be sustained.
1. The seizure of the Good Friends was for the same cause
with the seizures mentioned in the act of January 2, 1813.
2. The rights acquired by the seizing officer were of the same
nature and description with those acquired by the collector,
upon the seizures mentioned *in.the act of January 2, 1813.
3. The Good Friends, as well as the other vessels, were seized
for a violation of the non-intercourse laws.. 4. The seizures
were made subject to the power of remission given in the 18th
section of the non-intercourse law: and the rights of the seizing officer were inchoate and conditional," and might be remitted at any time before the collection of the money. 5. The
acts of January 2, 1813, and July 29, 1813, did not give the
power of remission. It directed the power to be exercised in
certain cases. 6. It has been the settled practice of the government to receive for itself, exclusively, the amount of duties due
upon a lawful importation, and to give no part of it to the
officer.
If in this case the appellant is entitled to a share of the duties due on a lawful importation, the five millions received
upon the remissions under the act of January 2, 1813, must
be divided, and the one half refunded to the seizing officer.
The settled practice of the government wsnld not now be disturbed by the court, unless the case was a clear nne under the

SUPREME COURT.

law. 7. The court have sanctioned the interpretation of-he
executive officers, and decided this case in effect in the case of
the United States v. Morris, 1 Payne, 209; 10 Wheat, 289,
290, 291, 292, 296.
The remission is not in the nature of a pardon, but of a
relief in equity--a restoration to his legal rights as a lawful
importer. The collector seizes subject to such equity; and if
the secretary decides the equity against the United States, the
collector is entitled to nothing.
The form in which it hasbeen found necessary to bring forward this question shows that the collector has no legal vested
right. Who could call for the money to be brought into court?
The United States rnever directed satisfaction to be entered.
They refuse to prosecute- further. How can the collector
proceed? Who is to ask that the money be brought into
court? Who is to be ordered to bring it in?
8. There can be no reason for regarding this portion as forfeiture, under the true meaning of the act of congress. The
question is, whether the legal duties are a part of this forfeiture contemplated by the act of March 2, 1799, chap. 128.
sect. 89. 91; 3 vol. 221, 223.
The right of the collector is founded on the act of March 1,
1809, 4 vol. 211, sect. 18. Did congress mean by this language, where the forL'eiture was remitted, to give to the collector the one half? 1. Where they authorised the forfeiture
to be remitted, they certainly intended that the legal duties
shortld, be paid. 2. They contemplated a case of unlawful
importation-a breach of the non-intercourse-for the penalty
is inflicted, and the power of remission given in such cases.
3. NNWhere they directed the distribution of the penalty, did
they mean the legal dues upon a lawful importation?
If this be the interpretation, the relief must always be
imperfect; for the United States, in order to protect themselves, must exact from the merchant more than the legal duties. The innocent must always suffer, or the United States
must lose a part of its revenue, and divide the duties with the
collector.
Those who imported goods from England, ithout a knowledge of tfie declaration of war, were free from all blame.
They ought not to suffer. It is said they made large profits.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

Is the public to lose? The seizure, in that case, is a positive-injury. If there was no seizure, the goods would be entered, and
the public receive the duties without abatement.
The government divides the forfeiture; it divides whatever
is gained by the vigilance of the officer. This is the compensation for bis responsibility-for the enemies he makes--the
friends he disobliges.
$ueh was the situation of the collector in the case before the
court, and he received as his'reward, twenty-seven thousand
dollars.
It is said that this release was by virtue of the law passed
after this seizure, and not before; and that different terms are
required, and therefore the power was derived from the liw of
1813. To this it is answered, that the terms are superadded by
the legislature, and the collector therefore had no right to complain. See act of 1797, 2d vol. 585. Act of January 2d,
1813, 4th vol. 485.
The legislature left the power as it stood,, but the officer
who might femit, refused to do it unless the additinal circumstances were proved. The legislature refused to admit it
to be done without them; and the officer refused to act on his
own responsibility without them. Yet, when it took place, it
was, by virtue of the power under-the act of 1797.
It is objected, that the United States have released the portion ofthe collector; but to this it is answered, that they-have
released no more- for him than for themselves. There was no
contract. The collector was the agent of the governmnent.
But supposing there was a contract:. It was no -more than
that the government would share with its agent whatever it
received as penalty, and the same amount must.be left to the
government, But such supposed contract would extend t6 the
whole cargo, if there was any right vested in the collectgrby
the seizure.
Mr Jones, in reply, contended, that the claims of the collector in the-case before the court, did not rest upon any general
law; nor were they to be arranged under any class of cases.
They are founded in a specific case, provided for in a particular law of the United States; and in which law congress had
not undertaken to judge of the merits of the claims. The ob-

SUPREME COURT.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

jection that this court cannot enforce these claims, is unexpected; since the United States have voluntarily submitted the
case to this court
It does not appear where the money claimed by the appellant is; it may be under the control of the court. It was paid
to the district attorney of the United States, it is true, as the
agent of the United States; and it may perhaps be Presumed
to have been paid into the treasury. But the question before
the court is as to the right of distribution, not as to the power
of enforcing it. The third section of the act of 1797, saves the
righis of the collector and of the seizing officer in all cases of
seizure before the act, and gives the court a right to judge of the
distribution; and the agreed case, now before the court, implies that the money shall- be deemed in court.
It is denied that the case of the United States v. Morris
decides this case. There, the law for remission existed at the
time of the forfeiture, and there was no question of distribution; but the only question in that case was, whether the execution could be enforced after the condition of the remission
had been complied with: and that case was under the act of
1797, when the discretion of the secretary of the treasury was
uncontrolled.
It is not admitted that the usage of the treasury should have
any influence in the case before the court. The right of the
appellant 'is to be decided by the acts of congress; and the court
will construe these acts without the aid of the practice of the
government.
There was no discretion as to the payment of the duties on
the cargo of the ship under the act of 1799; it was made absolute and indispensable that the duties should be paid; and they
were demanded, as a precedent condition to bonding the goods.
Those daties were not to be deducted if there should have been
ultimately a forfeiture of the goods bonded. But the law of
1813 made-no provision about delivering goods; and the whole
sum must be considered as paid as the price of redemption,
and of course all that was paid was penalty.
The act of 1799 goes on the ground of an offence having
been bommitted, but mitigated by circumstances; and the
secretary of the treasury has power to remit on such terms as
he thinks proper: and the act of 1813 goes on the same prin-

JANUARY TERM 1832.
EMWLane v. The United States.)

ciple, but no discretion is left to the secretary, on condition of
making certain payments.
The secretary had no power under the act of 1797 to remit
this property. The law of the 1st July was stronger than that
of January 1812; and under that law, all that the secretary had
to do, was to inquire whether Mr Girard, the owner of "the
Good Friends and cargo, was an American citizen.
It is denied that there was any distinction between legal and
extra duties. The whole amount which was paid by the owner
of the ship and cargo was paid as an entire sum; and the reference to duties was made only to ascertain the amount to be
paid, as the condition of redeeming the goods. The law
authorising this remission did not mean, by a retrospective
operation, to make lawful that which was illegal. No forms
of entry at the custom house were'gone through, nor was any
thing done as is required where duties on importation are imposed or collected.
The equity of the act of January 1813 was in favour of
merchants who had ordered goods, without having had notice
of the declaration of war in sufficient time to revoke the order.
The case of the Good Friends was not of that kind; but it
rested on other circumstances, and the authorising the remission was induced by other considerations. This is shown by
the petition of Mr Girard, to which the court is xeferred.
It is submitted that the law of July 1st, 1813 was nothing
more than a remission of the forfeiture, and did not put the
case on the ground of a lawful importation. In the cases
which were released by the act of January I813, there was a
clear and unqualified exemption from forfeiture or penalty,
on payment of duties. This was the fact in the case of the
Good Friends.
Mr Justice STOny delivered the Opinion'of the Court.
This case comes before the court upon an application made
by Allen M'Lane, collector of the district of Delaware, to the
circuit court of that district, for a decree of distribution of the'

authority of the act of congress of the 29th of July 1813, ch.
33. Upon the conditions required by that act the only controversy existing in the cause is between the United States
and the collector, in respect to his distributive share. The
United States and the collector agreed upon a special statement of the facts; upon which it was" further agreed that a
decree, pro forma, should be entered by the circuit court against
the col lector, for the purpose of a final decision in the supreme
court; and by an appeal from the pro forma decree so rendered, the cause now stands before this court.
Uponthe argument at the bar, some objection was suggested,
though not strenuously urged, against the jurisdiction of the
circuit court to entertain the cause under the peculiar circumstances. But this objection appears to us not well founded.
Where a sentence of condemnation has been finally pronounced
in a case of seizure, the court, as an incident to the possession
of the principal cause, has a right to proceed to decree a distribution of the proceeds, according to the terms prescribed by
law. And it is a familiar practice to institute proceedings
of thrs nature, wherever a doubt occurs as to the rights of the
parties who are entitled to share in the distribution. There is
nothing in the circumstances of the present case to displace
this jurisdiction. And it now appears, that the proceeds of
which the distribution is now claimed have been, by an express agreement between the United States and the collector,
put in a situation to be forthcoming to meet the exigency of
the decree which may be rendered upon the statement of facts.
The act of congress of the 29th of July 1813, enacts "that
the owners of the ships called the Good Friends, the Amazon
and the United States, and of the cargoes on board said vessels,
which arrived in the month of April 1812, in the district of
Delaware, from Amelia Island, with cargoes that were shipped
on board said vessels- in the united kingdom of, Great Britain
and Ireland, shallbe entitled to, and may avail themselves of
all the benefits, privileges and provisions of the act entitled "an

of September mentioned in said act, and bad arrived within the
United States after thqfirst day of July last."
The act of the 2d of January 1813, chap. 149 [chap. 7],
enacts that in all cases where goods, wares and merchandise,
owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States, have been
imported into the United States from the united kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, which goo~ds, &e.were shipped on
board vessels which departed therefrom between the 23d day

or persons interested in such goods, &c. or concerned in the

or forfeiture under an act, &c. &c. (reciting the titles of the
non-intercourse acts of 1st of March 1809, and of 1st of May

Great Britain and Ireland, owned as aforesaid, between the
23d day of June last and the 15th day of September last, the
secretary of the treasury is hereby directed to remit all fines,
penalties and forfeitures that may have been incurred under
the said act, in consequence of such shipment, importation or
importations upon the costs and charges, which have arisen,
or may arise, being-paid, and on payment of the duties
which would have been payable by law on such goods, 8c.,
iflegally imported, 4.c. 4.c."
The result of both of these acts taken together, as applicable to the case of the Good Friends, is, that the secretary, of
the treasury was directed to remit the forfeiture, upon the
payment of costs and charges, and the duties upon the cargo,
which would have been payable upon the same goods, if legally
imported, after the Ist of July 1812, that is to say, upon payment of the double duties imposed by the act of the 1st of July
1812, ch. 112. Without question, these acts of congress were
VOL. VI.-3 D

SUPREME COURT.
EM'Lane v. The United States.]

directory and mandatory to the secretary; and in his remission,
which forms a part of the case, he purports to act, and has in
fact acted in obedience to their requirements.
It is wholly unnecessary to inquire whether the secretary
would have had authority to remit the forfeiture in this case,
under the remission act of the 3d of March 1797, ch. 67; because, in the first place, the terms, upon which the remission is
to be granted by that act, essentially differ from those pre'scribed by these acts: and because, in the next place, the secretary purports to have acted in obedience to the latter.
The question then arises, in what light the reservation and
payment of the double duties, as conditions upon which the
remission is granted, are to be considered? Are the double
duties to be deemed a mere payment of lawful duties; or are
they to -be deemed a part of the forfeiture reserved out of the
proceeds of the cargo? If the latter be the true construction,
then the collector is entitled to a moiety: if the former, he is
'barred of all claim.
The duty of the collector in superintending the collection of
the revenue, and in making seizures for supposed violations of
law, is onerous, and full of perplexity. If he seizes any goods,
it is at his own peril; and he is condemnable in damages and
costs, if it shall turnout, upon the final adjudication, that there
was no probable cause for the seizure. As a just reward for
his diligence, and a compensation for his risks; at once to stimulate his vigilance and secure his activity; the laws of the
United States have aivarded to him a large share of the proceeds of the forfeiture. But his right by the seizure is but
inchoate: and although the forfeiture may have been justly
incurred, yet the government has reserved to itself the right
to release it either in whole oi in patt, until the proceeds have
been actually received for distribution; and in that event, and
to that extent, it displaces the right of the collector. Such
was the decision of this court in the case of the United States
v. Morris, 10 Wheat. Rep. 246. But whatever is reserved
by the government out of the forfeiture, is reserved, as well
for the seizing officer, as for itself; and is distributable accordingly. The government has no authority, under the existing
la'ws, to release the collector's share as such; and yet to retain
to itself the other part of the forfeiture.

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

In the present case, it is perfectly clear that the seizure of
the Good Friends and her cargo was justifiable, and that they
were forfeited for a violation of the non-intercourse acts. This
is established, not only by the final decree of condemnation,
but by the very terms of the remission granted by the secretary of the treasury. In point of law, no duties, as such,
can legally accrue upon the importation of prohibited goods,
They are not entitled to entry at the custom house, or to be
bonded.
They are, ipso facto, forfeited by the mere act of importation. The Good Friends, then, having arrived in April 1812,
long before the double duties were laid, and her cargo being
prohibited from importation; it is impossible, in a legal sense,
to sustain, the argument, that the importation could be deemed
innocent, And the government could be entitled to duties, as
upon a lawful importation. It was entitled to the whole property, by way of forfeiture; and to nothing by way of duties.
When, therefore, congress authorised the remission upon the
payment of double duties, the latter was imposed as a condition
of restitution upon the offending party. In the language of
the act of the 2d of January 1813, the remissipn was to be "on
payment of the duties, which would have been payable by law
on such goods, &c., if legally imported;" not upon payment
of the duties which had lawfully accrued upon the same goods.
The act presupposes that no duties had accrued, or could accrue
by operation of law upon the goods; and the act of the 29th of
July 1813 expressly treats it as a condition. Indeed, it is
impossible that double duties could have lawfully accrued upon
the importation of the cargo of the Good Friends, in April
1812, when the double duties were not imposed until the passage of the act of the 1st of July of the saffie year.
If the government had reserved a gross sum, equivalent to
the double duties, out of the forfeiture, as a condition of the
remission, there could be no doubt that the collector would
have been entitled to his moiety of the sum so reserved. Can
it make any difference in point of law, that-the reservation is
made by a reference to double duties, as a mode of ascertaining
that sum? It has not been pretended that the act of the 29th
of July 1813 could divest the rights of the collector, antecedently vested in him by the existing laws. And if such a

SUPREME COURT.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

doctrine could be maintained at all, it would still be necessary
to establish that there was an unequivocal intention on the
part of the government to remit his share, and to retain its
own share of the forfeiture. Such an extraordinary exercise
of power, if it could be even maintained. where it is subversive of existing rights, ought to be evidenced by terms susceptible of no doubt. We are of opinion that the present act
neither justifies nor requires any such construction. The
double duties are- referred to as a mere mode of ascertaining
the amount intended to be reserved out of the forfeiture; and
not as a declaration of intention on the part of the government,
that they were to be received as legal duties due upon a legal
importation.
But a distinction has been taken at the argument on behalf
of the United.States, and an apportionment or division of the
duties has been insisted on. If is said, that so much of the
duties demanded as were equal to the single duties payable
by law on imported goods in April 1812, ought to be considered as received in that character by the government; since
this case has been treated by the government as an innocent
importation. But as to the additional duties imposed -by the
act of Ist of July 18,12, they way be considered as a reservation of forfeiture. And it is added, that the government has
itself acted upon this distinction in this very case; for it Has
allowed the collector his moiety of the latter, and denied it in
respect to the former.
The true answer to be given to this argument is, that
the act itself contemplates no such apportionment or division
of the duties. The duties are reserved as a whole, and not
in moieties. And it could not well be otherwise; for, as
has been already shown, no duties at all were legally payable on the goods. They were in fac,, and were treated
by the government as prohibited goods. And when. the
government imposed the double duties as a condition, they
were imposed as a sum which would have accrued upon a
legal importation after the 1st day of July 1812. The very
circumstance, that the government itself has treated any part of
the reservation as forfeiture, and as distributable accordingly,
is conclusive to show that the whole is incapable of being
treated as duties. The distinction contended for, then, not

JANUARY TERM 1832.
[M'Lane v. The United States.]

being found in the act itself, and part of it being confessedly
received in the character of a forfeiture; we think the whole
must be treated as received as a reservation by way of forfeiture. Our opinion is grounded upon the fact, that the act
refers to the double duties as a mere mode of ascertaining the
amount; and that it is undistinguishable from the case of a
reservation of a gross sum.
Upon the whole, the decree of the circuit court refusing the
distribution is to be reversed, and the cause remanded to that
court with directions to decree to the legal representatives of
Allen M'Lane, the collector, one moiety of the double. duties,
deducting that portion which has been already received by
him.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court ofthe United States for the district of Delaware, and was argued by counsel; on consideration
whereof, this Court is of opinion, that there is error in the
decree of the circuit court, whereby it was ordered that the
said Allen M'Lane take nothing by his motion for a decree -of
distribution of the forfeiture decreed by the circuit court in
the proceedings in this cause, mentioned upon the statement
of facts in the same proceedings mentioned; and for this error
it is ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the decree of the said
circuit court upon the motion aforesaid, be and hereby is reversed and annulled. And this court, proceeding to render
such decree as the said circuit court ought to have passed, do
hereby order, adjudge and decree upon the said motion, and
statement of facts, that the said Allen M'Lane as collector, as
herein mentioned, was in his lifetime entitled, and that his
legal representative is now entitled to receive as his distributive share of the forfeiture aforesaid one full moiety of the
whole sum which has been paid by Stephen Girard according
to the act of congress, and the remission by the secretary of
the treasury, as in the same statement of facts mentioned. And
the said Allen Mi'Lane being now dead, it is further ordered,
adjudged and decreed, that the same full moiety be paid over
to his legal representative, now appearing and made a party
