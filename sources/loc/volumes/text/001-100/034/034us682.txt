SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES,

APPELLANTS V. THE BRIG BURDETT,

Maryland. An information was filed in the district court of the United
States on the 1st of October 1832 against the Brig Burdett, alleging her to
have been forfeited to the United States, for a violation of the registry acts,
she being owned in whole or in part by a foreigner, a subject of the king
of Spain. The vessel was purchased by an agent of George S, Steever,
a native citizen of the United States, and was sent to the Havana. From
the time of her arrival at Havana, she was placed under the direction of
J. J. Carrera, a merchant of that place, and all her voyages directed by
him, professing to act as the agent of MIr Steever. Part of the cost of the
brig was paid in cash by Mr Steever to his agent on his return to the
United States, and the balance charged by the agent and settled for in account with Mr Carrera. The counsel for the United States offered in evidence certain letters written by Mr Carrera to captain Nabb, the commander of the Burdett, during her several voyages, which had been directed
by him, and which letters related to the business and employment of the
Burdett. The letters were objected to as evidence, and were admitted in
the district and circuit court, to which latter court the case was taken on
an appeal by the claimant of the vessel. Held, that the letters were not
legal evidence.
The confessions of an agent are not evidence to bind his principal, nor is his
subsequent account of a transaction to his principal, evidence. But his
acts, within the scope of his powers, are obligatory upon his principal, and
those acts may Pe proved in the same manner as if done by the principal.
The agent acting within his authority, is substituted for the principal in
every respect; and his statements, which form a part of the res gestm,
may be proved.
The object of this prosecution was to enforce a forfeiture of the vessel and all
that pertains to her, for a violation of a revenue law. The prosecution was a
highly penal one, and the penalty should not be inflicted unless the infractions of the law shall be established beyond reasonable doubt.
That frauds are often practised under the revenue laws cannot be doubted,
and that individuals who practise these frauds are exceedingly ingenious
in resorting to various subterfuges to avoid detection, is equally notorious.
But such acts cannot alter the established rules of evidence, which have
been adopted, as well with reference to the protection of the innocent, as
the punishment of the guilty.
f a fair construction of the acts and declarations of an individual do not convict him of an offence, if the facts may be admitted as proved and the accused be innocent, should he be held guilty of an act which subjects him
to the forfeiture of his property, on a mere presumption? He may be
guilty, but he may be innocent. If the scale of evidence does not preponderate against him-if it hang upon a balance, the penalty cannot be enforced. No individual should be punished for a violation of law, which
inflicts a forfeiture of property, unless the offence shall be established beyond reasonable doubt. This is a rule which governs a jury in all criminal

[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]
prosecutions; and the rule is no less proper for the government of the court,
when exercising a maritime jurisdiction.

APPEAL from the circuit court of the United States for the
district of Maryland.
The case is fully stated in the opinion of the court.
Mr Butler, attorney-general, and Mr Williams, district
attorney of the United States for the district of Maryland, for
the apppellants.
Mr Meredith and Mr Kennedy, for the claimant of the brig
Burdett.
Mr Justice M'Lean delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case was brought into this court, by an appeal from
the circuit court of Maryland.
The appellants, by the attorney of the United States, flied
in the district court of Maryland, an informatiou on the 1st of
October 1832, for the purpose of enforcing a forfeiture of the
Brig Burdett, her tackle, apparel and furniture, to the use of
the Utnited States, on the ground, that the brig, though registered as a vessel of the United States was then, and still is,
owned in whole or in part, by a subject of a foreign prince,
viz. by a certain J. S. Carrera or a certain J. Carrera, a subject of the king of Spain, and resident abroad, which ownership was known to the persons owning or pretending to own
the whole or a part of the brig, in violation of the act of congress, &c.
The vessel having been attached, a claim was filed by
George G. Steever, in which he alleged that the brig was
originally built in the state of North Carolina, and purchased
by him of the original owner in May 1831, and thereupon
registered in his name, as sole owner he being a citizen of
the United States, and denied that the brig was, at the time
she was registered, or at any time since, owned in whole or in
part by Carrera, or by any other subject of any foreign prince
or state. The claimant also averred, that at the time of obtaining her registry, the vessel was, and ever since bad been, his
sole property.

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

The vessel having been appraised at 6000 dollars, and
security having been given by the claimant to abide by the
final order of the court, she was restored to him.
On the hearing of the cause, the testimony and depositions
of several witnesses were introduced, and much documentary
evidence offered on the part of the United States.
Several letters, proved to be in the handwriting of J. J.
Carrera, were offered in evidence on the part of the United
States, to the reading of which the counsel for the claimant
objected, on the ground that Carrera was not a party to the
case, which objection was sustained by the court.
The district court dismissed the information, and that decree,
on appeal, was affirmed by the circuit court.
In the argument the counsel for the appellants take two
grounds, on which they contend the decree of the circuit court
should be reversed.
1. That the letters of Carrerawere improperly rejected. He
was shown by all the witnesses to be the accredited agent of
the claimant, and his letters were, moreover, a material part
of the res gestee.
2. The evidence shows that the chief, if not the sole ownership of the brig, was in Carrera.
Much reliance is placed on the testimony of Chester and
Cox, two of the witnesses, to establish not only the agency of
Carrera, but other matters material in the case. The former
states that he lived three years in the house of Joseph Carrera,
preceding the last of June 1832. He was there during the
whole of the operations of the Burdett at Havana. He states
that Steever sent an order to colonel Tenant, of Baltimore, to
purchase for him a vessel, which was to be sent to him at Havana, and if he was absent, to the house of Carrera, in which
the witness was a partner to a limited extent. In obedience
to this order the Burdett was sent, consigned to the house of
Carrera, in the absence of Steever, who, had left the Havana
a few days before the arrival of the vessel, under the command
of Captain Nabb. He frequently conversed with Joseph Carrera, and his nephew J. J. Carrera, respecting the Burdett, and
never heard either of them assert any ownership or interest in
the vessel. Carrera was made the ship's husband, and had
positive orders from Steever, in his absence, to do with her as

JANUARY TERM 1835.

[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

if she were his own, and to employ her on freight to the best
advantage. When Steever was near enough to communicate,
he gave positive and specific orders. Witness has often seen
his letters on the subject.
The vessel performed several voyages under the orders of
Carrera, and after her return from New York, having been on
shore once or twice, some repairs were made under the direction of captain Nabb, which Carrera was apprehensive might
-not be sanctioned by Steever.
The witness thinks about 11,500 dollars, at six and eight
months credit, were paid for the vessel.
Richard G. Cox states, that he is a clerk of colonel Tenant's, and conducts all his business, and that the Burdett
was purchased by colonel Tenant on the order of Steever,
who was then at the Havana, and the vessel was sent there
subject to his order, and in his absence to Carrera. Before
the arrival of the vessel Steever had sailed for Boston, and
when he returned, being informed of the purchase, he paid
colonel Tenant 1100 dollars in part of the purchase money.
The vessel, including equipments, cost about 13,000 dollars.
The rest of the purchase money was paid by the house of Joseph Carrera. The witness has had correspondence with
Carrera respecting the vessel, and has insured her by orders
from Carrera on account of Steever. He has seen the correspondence with the house of Carrera, and has never heard or
seen any thing which goes to show that the Carreras had any
interest in the vessel, or that Steever was not the owner.
William W Russel, a merchant of the city of New York,
states, that he was consignee of the brig Burdett, in December
1831, at which time Nabb was master. The vessel came from
Havana and Matanzas under orders from Joseph Carrera, with
whom the witness corresponded respecting said vessel. The
witness understood from the letter of the 15th of November
1831, brought by her to him, that she was owned by G. G.
Steever of Baltimore. Witness accounted with Joseph Carrera
for the freight of the brig, but he has no knowledge that Carrera has any interest in her.
In a letter from Joseph Carrera to Russel, the above consignee, dated the 15th of November 1831, he says, "I have
requested cAptain Nabb tovalue on your good self on his arrival,

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

and I beg leave to solicit your attention in procuring a good
return freight to Havana for that vessel, as well as passengers,
&c. And on reference to Mr Steever's instructions, who, I
presume, will have left Baltimore for Mexico, captain Nabb is
authorised to take a voyage to Europe, &c. Of a voyage to
Europe Mr Steever's instructions are constructive as regards
the benefit to be derived from it. Whatever may be the destination of the Burdett from your port, I beg to request that you
will advise c01olel Tenant, in the absence of Mr Steever, to
have insurance effected on the brig." And again "my control
over this vessel is limited to give her employment, and to address her to my friends, wherever she may be found, but where
the owner can himself attend to her concerns, if he be so disposed, I shall feel obliged to you by transferring her to him."
Another letter signed by both the Carreras, dated Havana,
the 11th of January 1832, to Mr Russel, says, "I much regret
that the prospect of procunng a full freight for this vessel, for
this port, was not encouraging, &c. I rely, however, on your
friendly exertions to give her the best employment," &c.
And in another letter, dated the 24th of January 1832, to
Mr Russel, it is stated, "I have the pleasure of handing duplicates of my respects of the 11th current, and to own receipt
of your regarded favours of the 27th and 30th ultimo and I1th
instant, this last advising, that you intended to despatch the
Burdett for this port, &c. I feel confident you haveused your
utmost exertion in giving to this vessel the best employment," &c.
And in a letter from the same person to the same, dated the
8th of February 1832 "the Burdett arrived on the 30th, in
eleven days' passage. All the accounts relating to her will be
examined and booked in conformity. I have not, as yet, determined on the direction to give the Burdett."
Mr Russel wrote to Joseph Carrera, dated New York, December 31st 1831, "I acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed favour of the 12th ultimo, banded me by captain Nabb
of the Burdett, which vessel arrived on the 12th, after having
been off the coast for seven days, and suffering some slight
injury in her upper works. The extent of the damage will, I
presume, however, not amount to a claim on the underwriters,
but should it prove otherwise, the necessary documents will

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[United States v. The Brig BurdettJ

be forwarded to colonel Tenant, in order that he may clan
them.
"I have to return you my thanks for the favour done me in
the consignment of this vessel, which, however, will be
promptly surrendered to Mr Steever, should he be in this country, and be desirous of giving his personal attention to her concerns," &c.
Another letter, dated New York, 27th December 1831, from
the same to the same, states exertions used to procure a full
freight for the Burdett. And there is contained in the record
several other letters from Mr Russel to J. Carrera, dated at
New York, in January 1832, all of which relate to the freight
of the Burdett.
Certain letters from . J. Carrera to captain Nabb, numbered
in the record 1, 2, 3 and 4, were offered in evidence by the
district attorney, and were objected to by the claimant.
The letter numbered 1, is dated at Havana, November 15th
1831, and contains particular instructions to captain Nabb, as
to the voyage of the Burdett, the consignee in New York, and
the subsequent employment of the vessel after the discharge
of her cargo.
The letter numbered 2, and dated Havana, 26th November
1831, is of the same import.
Letter numbered 3, is dated Havana, 12th May 1832, in
which Carrera says, "Your letters of the 13th and 23d April
last have been received, and am sorry to hear of the damage
the Burdett has experienced i- a tremendous gale of wind
near the Bermudas. The certificate of survey, as well as the
estimate of repairs to be made on the Burdett, has been received the amount of repairs is enormous, but we must conform to it, if there should be no other remedy No doubt the
underwriters will have to reinburse the amount. I wrote to
colonel Tenant a few days ago, authorizing hin to arrange
the business of the Burdett as well as he can, and for the best
of my interest. I entreat you to consult him on the business,
and do for the best. The expenses and repairs are heavy, and
surpass my expectations. Mr Tenant has been authorized
by me to pay the amount required to fit out the vessel, but if
he thinks best to sell my four hundred boxes of sugar, he is at
liberty to do so, for they are insured at Baltimore.

SUPREME COURT.
[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

In letter numbered 4, and dated at Havana, 28th June
1832, Mr Carrera says, "I am in receipt of your valued favours
of the 1st, 11th and 21st May last, by which you inform me
of the last survey held on the brig Burdett, and that she was
condemned and to be sold at public auction, but, at the request
of our friend, colonel Tenant, the sale of the said vessel was
postponed, and that the said Tenant had sent two gentlemen
in order to have a private survey. &c.
"I am informed that the Burdett's cargo for Hamburg had
been shipped on board the brig John, this vessel having been
chartered by yourself, with the approbation of Mr Tenant, and
that she was to sail, &c.
"By this time, I presume, you have seen Mr Steever, and
hope thi friend will have succeeded in his claim against the
underwriters for a partial or a total loss on said vessel.
"I beg of you to do all in your power, that we may be able
to collect what is so justly due to the interested in that vessel."
And the district attorney offered to read other letters from
Carrera to captain Nabb, numbered on the record 5 and 6, if
the claimant would withdraw his objections to the above letters being read as evidence, but the objections were not withdrawn, and the same were sustained by the court.
The first question for the consideration of the court is, whether the above letters were properly rejected by the court below. It is objected that these letters contain but a part of the
correspondence on the same subject, and that the non production of the whole is unaccounted for.
The letters referred to were addressed by Carrera to captain
Nabb, and it may be7 that some of the letters written by him,
and also by Carrera in relation to the same matter, are not
produced. As this correspondence is not in the possession of
the plaintiffs, it is impossible for the district attorney to produce it.

If Carrera were to be treated as a mere agent, he might
have been examined as a witness, and compelled to produce or
swear to any letters in his possession, which have a bearing on
the ownership of the vessel. But the forfeiture is attempted
to be enforced on the ground that this same person is the owner
of the vessel, in whole or in part.
In this view, he would be required to swear in a matter

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

which concerns his own interest, as his oath, if received, would
go directly to establish or to refute the important point of ownership of the vessel. It was for this reason, it is presumable,
that Carrera was not examined as a witness.
So far as the proof of acts done within the scope of his agency
may be essential, it may be made by other evidence than his
own oath.
The proof of Carrera's agency, in reference to the Burdett,
is clear, and to consider him in this light, is the most favourable view for the claimant which can be taken of the case.
Carrera must have acted as agent or as principal, in regard
to thrs vessel. He planned her voyages, gave directions as to
her freight, appointed consignees, and paid for the repairs of
the vessel. That he did these things as the agent of the
claimant, is the only ground on which his right can be sustained, for if Carrera acted in any other capacity, it must be
fatal to the claim of Steever.
Under the circumstances of the case, it does not seem that
the objection, on the ground that all the correspondence was
not produced, should have been sustained by the court. If the
letters offered contained facts which were competent evidence
in the case, the principal could not object, because the correspondence referred to, was either in his possession, or the possession of his agent.
But it is insisted, if the whole of the correspondence were
produced, it would be inadmissible, because Carrera is no party
in the case.
The confessions of an agent are not evidence to bind his
principal, nor is his subsequent account of a transaction to his
principal, evidence. But his acts, within the scope of his
powers, are obligatory upon his principal, and those acts may
be proved in the same manner as if done by the principal.
The agent, acting within his authority, is substituted for the
principal in every respect, and his statements, which form a
part of the res geste, may be proved.
But it is not material to decide the point raised on the rejection of these letters. They may be considered as a part of the
record, and as presenting all the facts which they contain, in
connection with the other facts in the case, for the consideration of the court. And if on this broad view of the merits, the
VOL. ix.-4

[United States v. The Brig Burdett.]

prosecution shall not be sustained, it will become wholly unnecessary to determine any question as to the admissibility of
evidence.
The object of the prosecution against the Burdett is to enforce a forfeiture of the vessel, and all that pertains to it, for a
violation of a revenue law. This prosecution then is a highly
penal one, and the penalty should not be inflicted, unless the
infractions of the law shall be established beyond reasonable
doubt.
That frauds are frequently practised under the revenue laws
cannot be doubted, and that individuals who practise these
frauds are exceedingly ingenious in resorting to various subterfuges to avoid detection, is equally notorious. But such acts
cannot alter the established rules of evidence; which have been
adopted, as well with reference to the protection of the innocent, as the punishment of the guilty
A view of the evidence in this case, including the rejected
letters, must create a suspicion of fraud in the mind of every
one who reads it with attention. Steever went to the Havana
as supercargo of a vessel owned by colonel Tenant. His means
were limited. While at the Havana, he wrote to colonel
Tenant to purchase for him a vessel, and the Burdett was purchased, and sailed for Havana with a letter to Steever, which,
in his absence, was to be opened by Carrera. Steever being
absent, the letter was opened by Carrera, who, from that time
to the commencement of this prosecution, gave all necessary
directions respecting the Burdett, vith, as it would seem from
the evidence, little or no interference by Steever. And in addition to this, with the exception of 1100 dollars, it appears the
Burdett was paid for by the house of Carrera.
These facts, and others which are on the record, do authorise a suspicion that the vessel was purchased in the name of
Steever, for the benefit of Carrera. And we think, that the
proceeding instituted by the district attorney, in this case, was
justified from the facts which have been developed.
But the inquiry now is, not whether the prosecution was
properly instituted, but whether the evidence makes out a
forfeiture, in such terms as to require its enforcement by the
court.
Admitting the facts which have been stated, as creating
suspicion, are they conclusive I It appears that the vessel was

JANUARY TERM 1835.
rUnited States v. The Brig Burdett.]

purchased by the order of Steever, and that she was despatched
to the Havana, subject to his order. That he made the first
payment of 1100 dollars, and that he constituted Carrera his
agent to control the vessel, in every respect, as if she were his
own, in the absence of Steever. And that in many of the
letters of Carrera, respecting the vessel, her destination, her
freight, or her repairs, that he referred to Steever as her owner
and instructed the consignee and other agents to apply to
Steever for direction, if he were in the United States. That
in all these cases, Carrera professed to act in subordination to
the instructions of his principal.
The vessel was entered in the name of Steever, and she was
insured as his property. And as to the instructions given by
Carrera, and the payments of money by him, not only on the
contract of purchase, but also for repairing the vessel, they
are not at all inconsistent with the allegations of the claimant.
If Carrera acted bona fide as the agent of teever, he might
be expected to give the instructions he did give, and, out of the
profits of the vessel, make the payments which he did make.
It is said that these professions of Carrera, as to his agency,
&c., were made as a cover to the transaction. This, possibly,
may have been his motive, but are not the facts consistent
with an innocent motive q And if a fair construction of the
acts and declarations of an individual do not convict him of
an offence-if the facts may be all admitted as proved, and
the accused he innocent, should he be held guilty of an act
which subjects him to the forfeiture of his property, on mere
presumption. He may be guilty, but he may be innocent.
If the scale of evidence does not preponderate against himif it hang upon a balance, the penalty cannot be enforced.
No individual should be punished for a violation of law which
inflicts a forfeiture of property, unless the offence shall be
established beyond reasonable doubt. This is the rule.which
governs a jury in all criminal prosecutions, and the rule is no
less proper for the government of the court when exercising a
maritime jurisdiction.
After a full and mature examination of all the facts in this
case, whilst we admit the acts of the claimant are not clear
of suspicion, we are forced to the conclusion, that the evidence does not authorize a forfeiture of the vessel. The
decree of the circuit court is therefore affirmed.
