SUPREME COURT

CHARLES SCOTT, BAILIFF OF WILLIA31 S. M OORE, PLAINTIFF
IN ERROR V JOHN LLOYD.
Scholfield applied to Moore to raise or borrow 5000 dollars, securing him on
an annuity, or ground rent, on sufficient real estate, for one year. Moore
proposed to let him have the money for ten years on the same security.
After much discussion the parties agreed to divide the difference, and that
S. should keep the money for five years. A deed for sufficient real property in Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, securing the annuity, was
executed by S. , and the annuity or ground rent was paid for some years.
Scholfield, after the execution of the deed, securing the annuity to Moore,
sold and conveyed the estate, subject to the annuity or rent charge, to
Lloyd, and subsequent to the conveyance, he gave notice to Lloyd, not to
pay the rents to Moore, on the allegation that there were fraud and usury in
the transaction, and that the grant ofthe annuity was therefore void. At the
time this notice was given, Scholfield agreed in writing to indemnify and
save Lloyd from loss, if a distress should be made for the rent; and he would
resist the same by a writ of replevin. This was done by Lloyd. Lloyd and
others, as creditors of Scholfield, became afterwards possessed in absolute
property, by releases from and agreements with Scholfield, of all his,
Scholfield's interest in the reversion of the estate on which the rent was
secured, or any benefit or advantage from the suit, and was discharged by
the insolvent law of Virginia; but no release of Scholfield by Lloyd, from his
responsibility to save him harmless, for the resistance of the distress and
the action of replevin, was executed. On the trial of the action of replevin
in the circuit court, Scholfield was examined as a witness in favour of
Lloyd, to show that the original contract between him and Moore was usurious. Held, that he was an interested, and incompetent witness.
The statute against usury not only forbids the direct taking more than six per
centum per annum for the loan or forbearance of any sum of money; hut it
forbids any shift or device by which this prohibition may be evaded, and a
greater interest be in fact secured. If a larger sum than six per cent be not
expressly reserved, the instrument will not of itself expose the usury, but
the real corruptness of the contract must be shown by extrinsic circumstances, which prove its character.
The court was requested to say to the jury, that the facts given in evidence in
the trial of the case did not import such a lending as would support the defence of usury. By the Court. The court was asked to usurp the province
of the jury, and to decide on the sufficiency of the testimony, in violation of
the well established principle, that the law is referred to the court, the fact
to the jury.
The statute declares, " that no person shall on any contract take, directly or
indirectly, for loan of any money," &c., above the value of six dollars, for the
forbearance of 100 dollars, for a year." It has been settled, that to constitute the offence there must be a loan, upon which more than six per cent
interest is to be received, and it has been also settled, that where the con-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]
tract is in truth for the borrowing and lending of money, no form which can
be given to it will free it from the taint of usury, if more than legal interest
be secured.
The ingenuity of lenders has devised many contrivances by which, under
forms ,sanctioned by law, the statute may be evaded. Among the earliest
and most common of these, is the purchase of annuities secured upon real
estate or otherwise. The statute does not reach these, not only because the
principal may be put in hazard, but because it was not the intention of the
legislature to interfere with individuals in their ordinary transactions of buying and selling, or other arrangements made with a view to convenience or
profit. The purchase of an annuity or rent charge, if a bonafide sale, has
never been considered as usurious, though more than six per cent profit be
secured. Yet it is apparent, that if giving this form to the contract will afford a cover which conceals it from judicial investigation, the statute would
become a dead letter. Courts, therefore, perceived the necessity of disregarding the form, and examining into the real nature of the transaction. If
that be in fact a loan, no shift or device will protect it.
Though this principle may be extracted from all the cases, yet as each depends
on its own circumstances, and those circumstances are almost infinitely
varied, it ought not to surprise if there should be some seeming conflict in
the application of the rule by different judges. Different minds allow a
different degree of weight to the same circumstances.
The covenants in the deed from Scholfield, granting the annuity to Moore,
secure the payment of ten per cent for ever on the sum advanced. There
is no hazard whatever in the contract. loore must, in something more
than twenty years, receive the money he has advanced, with the legal interest on it, unless the principal sum should be returned after five years; in
which event he would receive the principal with ten per cent interest. The
deed is equivalent to a bond for 5000 pounds, amply secured by a mortgage
on real estate, with interest at ten per cent thereon, with liberty to repay
the same in five years. If the real contract was for a loan of money without
any view to a purchase, it is plainly within the statute.
An instruction to the jury which would separate the circumstances of the
case from each other, and the object of which is to induce the court, after
directing the jury that they ought to be considered together, to instruct
them that, separately, no one in itself amounted to usury, ought not to have
been given.
In the course of the trial of the cause in the circuit court, the counsel for the
plaintiff objected to a question put by the defendant's counsel to a witness,
as being a leading question. By the Court. Although the plaintiff's counsel objected to this question, and said that he excepted to the opinion of the
court, no exception is actually prayed by the party and signed by the judge.
This court cannot consider the exception as actually taken, and must suppose it was abandoned.

IN error to the circuit court of the United States for the county
of Washington, in the District of Columbia.
An action of replevin was instituted in March 1825, by John
Lloyd, in the circuit court of the United States for the county

Moore, and a declaration was filed in the common form, at
September rules of the same year. In November 1827, the
defendant filed the following avowry

the said place, when, &c., is parcel, and to levy by distress

Scholfield and Eleanor, his wife, by their certain deed of bargain and sale, under their seals, dated on the day and year
last mentioned, bargained, sold, and conveyed to the said John
Lloyd, his heirs and assigns for ever, certain tenements and

arrear and unpaid to the said William S. Moore, he, the said
Charles Scott, as bailiff of the said William, and by his command and authority at the said time when, &c., entered on
the said place where, &c., being parcel of the said four brick
tenements and lot of ground, so as aforesaid charged, with the
said annuity or rent, and liable to the distress of the said William, and took and carried away the said goods and chattels in
the declaration mentioned, then and there being found in the
said place where, &c., parcel of the said four tenements and
lot of ground, as a distress for the said rent so in arrear as aforesaid, to the said William, as he lawfully might, and this he is
ready to verify, &c. wherefore the said Charles prays judgment for the sum of 1000 dollars, being double the value of the
said rent so in arrear and distrained for as aforesaid, with full
costs of suit, &c., according to the statute in that case provided.
"The plaintiff's attorney thereupon filed four several pleas,
the first of which was
"And the said John, by Thomas Swann, his attorney, prays
oyer of the said indenture from the said Jonathan Scholfield
and Eleanor, his wife, to the said William S. Moore, in the
said cognizance mentioned, and the same is read to him in
these words, to wit which, being read and heard, the said
John saith that the said Charles, as bailiff of the said William
S. Moore, for the reasons before alleged, ought not justly to
acknowledge the taking of the goods and chattels aforesaid, in
the said place, in which, &c., because he saith that before the
making of the said indenture, that is to say, on the 11th day
of June, in the year 1814, at the county aforesaid, it was corruptly agreed between the said Jonathan Scholfield and the
said William S. Moore, that the said William S. Moore should
advance to him the said Jonathan, the sum of 5000 dollars,
and, in consideration thereof, that he the said Jonathan and
the said Eleanor, his wife, should grant, by a deed of indenture, duly executed and delivered to him, the said William, his
heirs and assigns for ever, a certain annuity or rent of 500 dollars, to be issuing out of, and charged upon a lot of ground and
four brick tenements, and appurtenances thereon erected, on
the east side of Washington street, and on the north side of
Duke street, in the town of Alexandria, bounded as follows

[Scott v. Lloyd.]

beginning at the intersection of said streets; thence north, on
Washington street, eighty-seven feet, more or less, to the partition wall between the fourth and fifth tenements from Duke
street, thence, east parallel to Duke street and with said partition wall one hundred and twelve feet to an alley; thence
with the line of the said alley eighty-seven feet to Duke street,
thence on Duke street, west, to the beginning; to be paid to
the said William, his heirs and assigns, by equal half yearly
payments of 250 dollars, on the 10th day of December, and on
the 10th day of June for ever thereafter. And it was further
corruptly agreed, that he, the said Jonathan, in and by the said
deed of indenture, should, for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, covenant with the said William, his
heirs and assigns, that he would well and truly pay to him,
the said William, his heirs and assigns, the said annuity or
rent of 500 dollars by equal half yearly payments, on the 10th
day of June, and 10th day of December, in each year, for ever
thereafter, as the same should become due, and that if the
same should not be punctually paid, that then it should be
lawful for the said William, his heirs and assigns, from time
to time, on every such default, to enter on the premises charged,
and to levy by distress and sale of the goods and chattels there
found, the rent in arrear, and the costs of distress and sale,
and if the same should remain in arrear and unpaid for the
space of thirty days after any day of payment as aforesaid, and
no distress sufficient to satisfy the same could be found on the
premises, that then it should be lawful for the said William,
his heirs and assigns, to enter upon the premises charged, and
from thence to remove and expel the said Jonathan, his heirs
and assigns, and to hold and enjoy the same as his and their
absolute estate for ever thereafter, and it was further corruptly
agreed between the said Jonathan and him, the said William,
that he the said Jonathan should enter into these further
covenants in the said indenture, that is to say, a covenant that
he the said Jonathan, at the time of the execution of the said
indenture, was then, in his own right, seised in fee simple in
the premises charged, free from any condition or incumbrance,
other than such as were specified in a deed-from the said Jonathan to Robert J. Taylor, dated the
day of
, and
that he, the said Jonathan, his heirs and assigns, would, for ever

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

thereafter, keep the buildings which then were, or thereafter
might be, erected on the premises charged, fully insured
against fire in some incorporated insurance office, and would
assign the policies of insurance to such trustee as the said
William, his heirs or assigns, might appoint, to the intent that
if any damage or destruction from fire should happen, that the
money received on such policies might be applied to rebuilding
or repairing the buildings destroyed or damaged, and that he,
the said Jonathan, his heirs and assigns, would execute and
deliver any further conveyance which might be necessary,
more completely to charge the premises before mentioned with
the annuity aforesaid, and to carry into full effect the intention
of the said parties, and, lastly, that he and his heirs would for
ever warrant and defend the annuity or rent, so agreed to be
granted to Ihe said William, his heirs and assigns, against any
defalcations and deductions for, or on account of, any act of
him, his heirs or assigns, and the said William did further
corruptly agree that he would, in the said indenture, covenant
for himself, his heirs atad assigns, with the said Jonathan, his
heirs and assigns, that if the said Jonathan, his heirs or assigns, should at any time thereafter, at the expiration of five
years from the date of the said indenture, pay to the said
William, his heirs or assigns, the sum of 5000 dollars, together
with all arrears of rent, and rateable dividend of the rent for the
time which should have elapsed between the half year's day
then next preceding, and the day on which such payment
should be made, he, the said William, his heirs and assigns,
would execute and deliver any deeds or instruments which
might be necessary for releasing and extinguishing the rent or
annuity thereby agreed to be created, which, on such payments being made, should for ever after cease to be payable.
"And the said John saith that afterwards, to wit, on the
same day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, the said
William, in pursuance and in prosecution of the said corrupt
agreement, did advance to the said Jonathan the said sum of
5000 dollars, and the said Jonathan and Eleanor his wife,
and the said William, did then and there make, seal, and duly
deliver to each other, respectively, the said deed of indenture,
as their several acts and deeds, which said deed was duly acknowledged by the said Eleanor; and admitted to record. And

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott V. Lloyd.]

so the said John saith that the said deed of indenture, in the
said cognizance mentioned, was made in consideration of money advanced upon and for usury, and that by the said indenture there has been reserved and taken above the rate of
six dollars in the hundred, for the forbearance of the said sum
of 5000 dollars so advanced as aforesaid, for the term of one
year, and that the said John is ready to verify whereupon he
prays judgment, if he ought to be charged with the rent
aforesaid, by virtue of the indenture aforesaid, and for as much
as the said Charles hath acknowledged the taking of the said
goods and chattels, he, the said John, prays judgment and his
damages, on occasion of the taking and unjust detaining of
the said goods and chattels, to be adjudged to him, &c."
The second plea is in all respects like the first, except it
states that the agreement was, that Moore should "lend" to
Scholfield 5000 dollars. It then states that the parties agreed
a deed should be made containing all the covenants set forth
in the first plea. It then avers that in pursuance and in prosecution of this corrupt agreement, Moore did advance to Scholfield the sum of 5000 dollars, and that .Scholfield and wife,
and Moore, made and executed the deed aforesaid, in pursuance
of this corrupt agreement, which was duly acknowledged and
admitted to record. And that the deed was made in consideration of "money lent upon and for usury -" and that by it
there has been reserved and taken above the rate of six dollars
in the hundred, for the forbearance of the sum of 5000 dollars
so lent as aforesaid, for the term of one year. This plea concludes as the first does.
The third plea is more general than the first and second.
It states, that before the malang of the indenture, that is to
say, on the 11 th of June 1814, it was corruptly agreed between
Scholfield and Moore, that he, Moore, should "advance" to
him, Scholfield, the sum of 5000 dollars, upon the terms and
conditions, and in consideration of the covenants and agreements in the indenture mentioned and contained, and that in
pursuance of this corrupt agreement, and in the prosecution
and fulfilment of the same, Moore did advance to Scholfield
the sum of 5000 dollars, and they, Scholfield and Moore, did
make, seal, and duly deliver the deed to each party respectively,
as their act and deed. And that the deed was in consideraVOL. ix.-3 D

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

tion of money advanced upon and for usury, and that by the

indenture there has been taken and reserved above the rate of
six dollars in one hundred, for the forbearance of the sum of
5000 dollars, so advanced as aforesaid for the term of one year.
This plea concludes as the first does.
The fourth plea is like the third, except it is stated that
the agreement was to "lend" 5000 dollars upon the same terms
stated in the third plea. It then avers, that in pursuance and
in execution of the corrupt agreement in the indenture mentioned, Moore did "iend" to Scholfield the sum of 5000 dollars,
that the deed' was duly executed by the parties, and recorded,
that it was made in consideration of money lent upon and for
usury, and that by the said deed there has been reserved and
taken above the rate of six dollars in the hundred for the forbearance of the sum of 5000 dollars, so lent as aforesaid, for
the term of one year. This plea concludes as the others do.
To each of these pleas there was a special demurrer, and
particular causes of demurrer assigned.
The circuit court, in November 1828, gave judgment for
the defendant, and the plaintiff prosecuted a writ of error to
this court. 4 Peters 205.
At the January term 1830 of the supreme court, the judgment of the circmt court was reversed, and the case was remanded to the circuit court with instructions to overrule the
demurrers to the second and fourth pleas, and to permit the
defendant to plead, and for further proceedings, &c. 4 Peters
231.
On the coming of the mandate into the circuit court, in
November 1830, the demurrers were withdrawn, and there
was a general replication to the pleas filed in November 1827.
The case was then, on the application of the defendant,
removed to Washington, and a transcyipt of the record of proceedings, with the original papers, was transmitted to the
clerk of the circuit court for the county of Washington.
At November term 1832 of the circuit court, the cause
came on for trial, and a verdict and judgment were entered in
favour of the plaintiff.
The defendant sued out this writ of error.
On the trial, the counsel of the defendant filed four bills of
exception.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

These exceptions are set forth at large in the opinion of the
court, and the evidence given on the trial of the cause, is
particularly stated in the first exception.
The material parts of the deed from Jonathan Scholfield and
wife, to William S. Moore, referred to in the pleas of the plaintiff in the circuit court, were
"The indenture is dated the 11 th of June 1814, and is from
Scholfield and wife, of Alexandria, in the district of Columbia.
It recites, that in consideration of 5000 dollars in hand, paid by
William S. Moore, of the same town, he grants, bargains and
sells to the said William S. Moore, his heirs and assigns for
ever, one certain annuity, or rent, of 500 dollars, to be issuing out of and charged upon a lot of ground" (describing the
premises), "to be paid to the said William S. Moore, his heirs
and assigns, by equal half yearly payments of 250 dollars, on
the 10th day of December and on the 10th day of June, for
ever, hereafter, to hold the said annuity or rent, to the said
William S. Moore, his heirs and assigns, to his and their own
proper use, for ever. And the said Jonathan Scholfield, for
himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, does
hereby covenant with the said William S. Moore, his heirs and
assigns, as follows, that is to say, that he the said Jonathan
Scholfield, his heirs and assigns, will well and truly pay to the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

The case was argued by Mr Coxe and Mr Jones, for the
plaintiff in error; and by Mr Key and Mr Swann, for the defendant.
The counsel for the plaintiff in error presented a brief of the
grounds on which they claimed that the judgment of the circuit court should be reversed. The brief stated On the trial which gives rise to this writ of error, various
questions were presented, which appear in the several bills of
exceptions annexed to the record.
The first was to the admissibility of Jonathan Scholfield as
a witness.
The grounds on which this witness was objected to are apparent on the-record.
1. He was a party to the instrument now sought to be impugned.
2. He was a party in interest.
3. His testimony was incompetent, because it went to vary
and contradict the written contract between the parties.
Yanous releases, &c. were adduced by the plaintiff to remove
the objection arising from his interest.
The second exception presents a question for the decision
of the supreme court, growing out. of the refusal of the circuit court to instruct the jury, as prayed by the counsel for the
defendant.
The testimony before the jury was both written and parol.
The written embraced the deed-between Scholfield and Moore,
which is incorporated into the pleas of plaintiff, and the parol
testimony is that of the several witnesses whose evidence is
given at length in the record.
The court was asked to instruct the jury that the contract
between said Jonathan Scholfield and William S. Moore, such
as it is evidenced by the deed from said Scholfield and wife to
said Moore, was lawful, and free from the taint of usury In
order to impeach it of usury, and support the issues of fact
joined in this cause, on the part of the plaintiff, it is necessary
for the plaintiff to prove that, besides the contract imported bythe terms of said deed, there was an actual contract between
said Scholfield and Moore for the loan of 5000 dollars at usurious interest, to wit, at the rate of ten per centum per annum,

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

to be disguised under the form and name of an annuity, or
rent charge, and that such loan was actually lent by said
Moore to said Scholfield, and said deed given in pursuance and
execution of such contract and loan, securing the said usurious
interest, under the form and name of such annuity or rent
charge, that the facts so given in evidence to the jury as
aforesaid did not import such a lending of money by Moore to
Scholfield at usurious interest, as was sufficient to support the
issues joined on the part of the plaintiff in replevin upon the
second and fourth pleas by the plaintiff in replevin, pleaded to
the cognizance in this case.
This instruction the court refused to give, and the defendants excepted, and will contend that such refusal was erroneous.
The plaintiff prayed the court, upon the same evidence, to
instruct the jury that the matters shown in evidence to the
jury as aforesaid are proper for the consideration of the jury, to
determine, from the whole evidence, under the instruction of
the court as already given to them in this cause, whether the
said contract so made between the said Moore and Scholfield,
was in substance and effect aloan at usurious interest, or a bona
fide contract for the bargain and sale of a rent charge, and if
the jury, from the said whole evidence, under the instruction
as aforesaid, shall believe it to have been such a loan, they
should find for the plaintiff, if otherwise, for the defendant.
This prayer was granted, and the plaintiff in error contends
that the instruction should not-have been given as prayed.
The counsel for the defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury that if they shall believe, from the evidence
aforesaid, that the land out of which the said rent charge mentioned in said deed from Scholfield to Moore was to issue, was
in itself, and independently of the buildings upon the same,
wholly inadequate and insufficient security for the said rent,
that then the jury cannot legally infer, from the clause in the
said deed containing a covenant on the part of said Scholfield
to keep the said houses insured, any thing affecting said con'tract with usury or illegality, which instruction the court refused to give.
The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury
that if they shall believe, from the evidence aforesaid, that the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

fair and customary price of annuities and rent charges, at the
date of said deed from Scholfield, was, in the market of Alexandria, ten years' purchase, and so continued for a period of
years, then, from the circumstance of the rent being ten per
centum on the amount advanced, the jury cannot legally infer
any thing usurious or illegal in the contract.
The court refused both the said instructions, and defendant
excepted.
The counsel for the plaintiff in error contended
1. That the testimony'of Jonathan Scholfield was incompetent and inadmissible, and should have been excluded.
2. That the court erred in giving the instruction which was
given at the instance of plaintiff.
3. That it erred in refusing to give the instructions prayed
by the defendant.
Mr Coxe, for the plaintiff in error, argued that Scholfield was not a competent witness. He was the original
grantor to Moore of the rent for which the distress was made,
and he afterwards sold the property, on which it was secured,
to Lloyd. Up to a certain time, he was the real party to the
suit. at its commencement, and for three years afterwards.
The covenants in the deed bind him to pay the rent, which,
by his testimony, he now seeks to extinguish, and to discharge
hiniself from the obligation of those covenants.
The notice of Scholfield to Lloyd, not to pay the rent, and
his engagement, in that notice, to indemnify him for resisting
the claim of Moore, and to protect him from costs, is in full
force. Its obligation has not been impaired or released by
the subsequent transactions between him and Lloyd by which
Lloyd became the owner of the property.
The part taken by Scholfield in this case, makes him a
privy to the action. The judgment in the case would be evidence for him, if Moore should resort to the personal covenants
in the deed, which are continuing covenants. Scholfield is a
guarantee of the rent to Moore, and if Lloyd does not pay it,
he must do so. 4 Binney 352, 1 Stark. Evid. sect. 58, note 1,
3 Espin. Cas. 58, 59.
Scholfield is introduced to destroy his own contract. This

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

contract is assignable, and this objection comes within the principles of the rule which excludes the party to a negotiable instrument, being a witness to destroy its vitality, as much so as
a bill of lading, or a stock contract. 3 Dallas 505.
The proceedings for the discnarge of Scholfield under the insolvent laws of Virginia, passed to the assignees the possibility
of interest in the property conveyed to Lloyd, this interest
would be important, if the rent payable to Moore was discharged, or ceased to be a lien on the real estate. The evidence of Scholfield was intended to destroy the lien of the rent,
and thus to increase the fund for the discharge of his debts, 3
P Wins 132, Fearne on Contingent Remainders 549.
The second bill of exceptions embodies three propositions.
1. That the contract was not on its face usurious.
2. That besides the written evidence in the deed from
Scholfield to Moore, there must be other evidence to show
usury, as a separate usurious contract, on which the deed was
given.
3. That the parol evidence was entirely insufficient to show
usury
This court has decided, 4 Peters 224, that the contract in
the deed is not on its face usurious. This has also been decided at this term in the case of the Bank of the United States
v. Waggener. If a contract was made other than that in the
deed, it should be proved, and there is no evidence of it. The
plea sets out a separate and substantial agreement for usury,
other than the deed, and this must be made out by evidence.
There is no such evidence.
If there be no stipulation to return the money to the purchaser, and the deed is not a cover for taking usurious interest,
it is noj a loan. It is essential to a loan, that the thing borrowed is to be returned. The communication of the purpose
must be mutual. A meditated lban may be bona fide converted into the purchase of an annuity. Cited 2 Lev. 7, 1
Anderson, new ed. 47, Comyn on Usury 43, 47, 48, Fuller's
Case, 4 Leon. 208; Noy 151, 2 W Black. 859, 3 Wils. 390,
1 Atk. 30, Ord on Usury 23.
The instructions required of the court, by the plaintiff in
error, should have been given as asked.
The third instruction asked of the court was, that the whole

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

matters in evidence, under the instructions already given, were
proper for the jury to determine, whether the contract was, in
substance and effect, a loan at usurious interest, or a contract
for the bargain and sale of a rent charge.
The objection to this is, that it left to the jury the legal effect
of the deed. It was not left to the jury, that it was incumbent
on the party to show by any testimony, independent of the
agreement, that there was a contract for a loan. Thus the
law, as well as the fact, was submitted to the jury The attention of the jury was not directed to the true issue in the
cause. The intention to take usury was essential. This
the court have said in the case of The Bank of the United
States v. Waggener.
In the fourth exception, it appears that the court refused to
state the law to the jury.
Mr Swann, for the defendant in error.
Scholfield is a competent witness. The record in this case
could not be used for him, his interest is, that Lloyd shall be
held liable for the rent. 3 Stark. Evid. 1063, 1 Munf. 348,
2 Hen. and Munf. 200.
By his assignment, under the insolvent laws, all his interest
in the property, supposing it discharged from the rent by the
usurious character of the incumbrance, passed to his creditors
nor is it admitted that, under any circumstances, he could
derive any benefit from any issue of this case. He stands released by all the parties, except the original lender; all others
have discharged him, as appears by the record. By the purchase of the whole property from him by Lloyd, there no longer
existed any thing for his agreement to indemnify him for the
costs of suit, &c. to operate upon.
Suppose the decision in this case against Lloyd, and he were
to sue Scholfield on that agreement, could he recover I 'Every
contract, by parol, was merged in the contract of 1828, which
was under seal. If tenant surrenders to landlord, the covenants of the tenant are merged in the deed.
The deed from Scholfield to Moore cannot be viewed as a
negotiable paper, and thus prevent Scholfield's evidence, as his
name is to it. 3 Term Rep. 7, 7 Term Rep. 56, 180. The
objection goes rather to his credit, than to his competency.
VOL. MX.-3 E

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

The object of both the parties to this suit is to have the
opinion of the court on the main question, of usury, or not
usuryl
It is contended that the contract between the parties contains evidence from which the jury might infer usury. A full
examination of the evidence will satisfy the court that the
object of Scholfield, who was a necessitous man, was to borrow
money, and that of Moore, who was a money lender, was to
obtain a larger rate of interest than was legal. The resort to
this rent charge was a cover to effect these purposes.
While it is admitted that an annuity may, if the transaction
is in good faith, and for no other purpose but such purchase,
be bought at any fair price it is denied, that a negotiation
originating in the desire of the owner of real estate to procure
a loan of money, when, by the means of a rent charge secured
on his property, this money is obtained at an extravagant rate
per annum, is freed from the taint of usury The circumstances of this case are to be considered and taken together,
and if they are, in fact, but a cover to evade the law, the contract is void. While cases may be found, and some have been
cited, in which an annuity produced a greater interest than
was legal, and which, although there was no opportunity of
redemption, have not been considered usurious, yet the courts
of England have, since those cases, examined the matters of
the contract with more scrutiny, and have on the contract, as
set forth in the deed creating the annuity, adjudged it usurious;
and considered it as a shift to escape from the statute. It is
only the good faith of the transaction which will protect it.
Within the principles, that no machinery, however well
devised, no form of conveyance, however well projected, no
concealment, however ingenious; will permit thelaw prohibiting
usury to be eluded, comes that now before the court. Inspection of the deed from Scholfield to Moore, even without the
testimony of Scholfield and of the other witnesses, resultsin the
irresistible conclusion, that the whole arrangement was one to
secure a higher rate of compensation for forbearance than was
legal. There was no hazard, no contingency. The property
was ample the subsequent sale made by Scholfield to Lloyd
proves this, the obligation to insure against fire, saved the
grantee in the deed from the possibility of loss by fire.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

In reference to the obligation to repay the money advanced,
although it was not express, the high rate of interest made it
an implied obligation, and a certain result.
If a man should advance 1000 dollars for ten years, receiving
a rent which would repay the amount, with ten per cent interest, the contract would be usurious. This would be a shift to
secure the repayment of the sum advanced, without any express stipulation for the repayment. Courts lok at the substance of the contract, and decide on its character after such
an examination. A personal obligation to redeem does not
make any difference as to the validity of the contract, if the
redemption would be indispensable, as in the case before the
court, where the property was worth more than the sum advanced. Cited, Cowp. 740, 775, Doug. 740, Conway's Executors v. Alexander, 7 Cranch 236, 2 Cond. Rep. 479.
The dictum of lord Holt, in the case cited by the counsel for
the plaintiff in error, from 2 Lev. Rep. is not law, although
the decision of the case may be right. In that case, there was
a real purchase and sale. Had there been a power of redemption, it would have been a cause of suspicion.
In 2 Atkyns 278, it was held, that a covenant to repay the
money was not indispensable, a power to redeem is suspicious,
under circumstances. In 3 Bos. and Pul. 159, the same point
was decided. Cited also, 4 Campb. 1, 3 Barn. and Aid. 664,
3 Harris and Johns. 109, 114, 4 Peters 224.
Scholfield not only bound the land for the rent, but he also
covenanted personally to pay the amount, and to keep the property insured, and in good repair. This was more than the
usual contract for an annuity. The witnesses in this case also
prove that there was a bargain, viz., about the right of redemption, and the lender, Moore, insisted on its being postponed longer than Scholfield desired.
Mr Key, also for the defendant in error, insisted on the competency of Scholfield as a witness. He cited, 1 Wheat. Rep. 6,
1 Phil. Ev. 33, 40, 245, 252, 2 Wash. Virginia Rep. 32.
The promise to indemnify Lloyd, made him interested in the
event of the suit, but the circumstances were afterwards
altered. His interest became afterwards balanced. A reco-

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

very against Lloyd would excuse him, and if against Moore, he
might be liable., The rule in Walton v. Shelly, has been
overruled in Jordan v. Lashbrook. Cited, 15 Johns. 1270, 8

On the question of usury in the transaction, he contended,
that, upon the face of the deed, there was enough to show its
usurious character. The return of the money advanced'was
plainly contemplated, at the end of five years. The prayers on
both stdes presented no more than the purpose of submitting
to the jury, whether the transaction was a fair and bona fide
purchase of a rent charge, or whether it was a cloak for usury.
The former decision of this court, in the case, authorised the
reference of the deed of Scholfield to Moore, to the jury, as an
item for their consideration in examining the question of usury.
Cited 7 Cranch 239 , 2 Peters 150,
As to the fourth prayer of the defendant in the circuit court,
it only singles out particular facts in evidence, and asks instructions to the jury upon them, when the court had already
given instructions on the whole evidence. No new question
was presented by this prayer, and the action of the circuit
court upon it was legal and proper.
Mr Jones, in reply.
Scholfield is an incompetent witness.
He was grantor of the rent charge, and he became insolvent
in 1822, was in confinement at the suit of creditors, and discharged under the insolvent laws of the state of Virginia.
He sold the property, liable to the rent charge, to the defendant in error, and the value of the same must have been deducted from the price paid by Lloyd, who will therefore be
accountable to Scholfield or to his creditors, if the rent charge
is got nd of.
The amount thus payable, in the event of success in this
controVersy, is held in trust for certain preferred creditors of
Scholfield, and only a part of those creditors.
It was part of the agreement made when Lloyd first resisted
the claim of the rent, that Scholfield would indemnify him for
all the costs and consequences of this resistance, and this obli-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

gation is not affected in any way by any of the subsequent
transactions between them, nor has he been released by Lloyd
from this liability
This discharge, under the insolvent law of Virginia, was
only extended to the plaintiff in the execution under which he
was in confinement, and not to his liability to other creditors;
unless the property assigned by him at the time of his discharge, will fully pay all his creditors. And this discharge
did not in any manner affect his obligation of indemnity.
A mere possibility passes to creditors under the bankrupt
act, and if this rent charge is extinguished, the benefit of the
extinguishment will go to the creditors, and will go so far to
satisfy the debts of Scholfield.
Upon more general grounds, Scholfield is not legally a witness.
Admitting he has no pecuniary interest in the result of this
suit, he is inadmissible, by reason that he is a party to the
alleged corrupt agreement with Moore, and is called upon to
destroy his own deed.
This case comes within the rule in Walton v. Shelly,
which has been adopted and confirmed by this court. The
principle in that case extends to all instruments. It is an
estoppal, by general principles, that a man shall not be permitted to destroy his own deed. But waiving this, Scholfield
is substantially a party. This is not dependent on the result
of the suit. It may not be a legal privity, whether equitable
or lgal, it is enough. Cited, 2 Lord Raymond 730, [Hardres 472, 2 Stark. Ev 193, Sch. & Lefr. 410, 9 Yes. Jun.

substantially the same, the objection lies to their privity, and is
not confined to blood. 2 Stark. Ev. 194, Phil. Ev. 74, 75,
1 Bing. Rep. 45.
On the question of usury, Mr Jones contended that there
was no evidence, which, if admitted, could have induced a jury
to believe there was any usury in the transaction. There is
no objection on the ground of dealing in annuities and rent

charges, whatever may be the rates at which they may be
purchased or sold. All the cases on this subject are collected
in Comyn on Usury. Annuities are fair objects of purchase
and sale. 1 Com. Dig. 621.
It is admitted that if there was any security given to return
the money paid, it is enough to vitiate the contract, but this
was not so. It was no more the case than in any other purchase of an annuity or rent charge, when the annual sum
paid exceeds the legal interest of the purchase money The
right to repay the money reserved in the deed from Scholfield
to Moore, was not an obligation to repay it, and thus the case
is unaffected by this feature in it.
The circuit court, by their instructions, referred the construction of the deed to the jury. As there was no evidence out of
the deed from which a contract for usury could be inferred,
the court ought to have told the jury that there was no evidence of any usury.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is an action of replevin instituted in the circuit court
for the county of Alexandria, and removed, for trial, to the
county of Washington.
The plaintiff in error, the original defendant, avowed as
bailiff of William S. Moore, that the goods replevied were distrained for rent in arrear. The plaintiff in replevin, after craving oyer of the deed, by which the rent alleged to be in arrear
was reserved, pleaded the statute of usury in bar of the claim.
The plea alleged that the contract between the parties was a
corrupt and usurious lending of the sum of 5000 dollars, upon
an interest of ten per centum per annum.
Other issues were joined in the cause, but they are not
noticed because they are of no importance.
On the trial, the plaintiff in replevir offered Jonathan Scholfield as a witness, who was objected to by the avowant, but
admitted by the court, and to this admission the avowant excepted.
In support of his objection to the competency of the witness,
the counsel for the avowant exhibited a deed, executed on the
1 th of June 1814, by Scholfield and wife, to William S. Moore,

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

by whose authority the distress was made; by which the said
Scholfield and wife, in consideration of 5000 dollars paid by
the said Moore to the said Scholfield, granted to the said Witliam S. Moore, his heirs and assigns for ever, one certain annuity or rent of 500 dollars, to be issuing out of and charged
upon a lot of ground, and four brick tenements and appurtenances thereon erected, lying In the town of Alexandria, and
particularly described in the deed.
Also a deed between the said Scholfield and wife of the first
part, John Lloyd the plaintiff in replevin of the second part,
and Andrew Scholfield ofN the third part, conveying to the
said John Lloyd the lot out of which the annuity or rent
charge of 500,dollars, had been granted to William S. Moore.
This deed contains several covenants, and, among others, a
stipulation that the lot shall remain subject to the annuity to
William S. Moore.
Also the following letter from Scholfield to Lloyd.
"Alexandria, June 9th 1824.
"Sir-As you hold under me the property on which I
granted a rent charge of 500 dollars a year to William S.
Moore, I now give you notice, the contract by which that rent
charge was created I consider to be usurious, and that I shall
take measures to set aside the same; and I hereby require you
to withhold from William S. Moore the payment of any farther
money, on account of this rent charge, and in case distress
should be made upon you for the rent, I promise to save you
harmless if you will resist the payment by writ of replevy. I
wish you to understand, that if you make any farther payments after receiving this notice, that you make them at your
own risk."
I am with great respect, yours,
JONATHAN SCHOLFIELD.

To Mr JOHN LLOYD,
This letter was delivered to Mr Lloyd on the day of its date.
Also a deed of the 18th of November 1826 from said Scholfield,
making a conditional assignment of one-fifth of said annuity
of 500 dollars to Thomas K. Beale in which he recites and

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

acknowledges his responsibility to Lloyd, on account of the distress for rent made by William S. Moore.
Also, an exemplification of the record of the proceedings in
the county court of Fairfax, in the commonwealth of Virginia,
upon the insolvency and discharge of the said Scholfield, as an
insolvent debtor, in May 1822.
Whereupon the plaintiff in replevin, to support the competency of the said Scholfield, laid before the court the following
documents.
A release from said Scholfield to the plaintiff in replevin,
dated the 13th day of June 1831 , whereby said Seholfield, in
consideration of 6000 dollars released to him by the said Lloyd,
out of a debt due by him to Lloyd, grants to said Lloyd all the
right, title and interest, which he has, or may have, from the
decision of the suit depending for the annuity or rent charge
granted to Moore, or which he has, or may have thereafter,
to the brick buildings upon which the said annuity or rent
charge is secured. He also releases the said Lloyd from all
covenants or obligations, expressed or implied, ansing, out of
the deed of assignment from him to said Lloyd, and also from
all claims, &c., which now exist, or may hereafter arise out of
the said deed, &c. Also a release from the same to the same,
dated 25th April 1828, in which Scholfield releases to Lloyd
all his right, &c., to the said suit, &c., and to all sums of
money which may accrue, and from all actions, &c., on account of the said suit, &c.
Also, a release of the same date from Thomas K. Beale and
James M. M'Crea, releasing the said Jonathan Scholfield
from 950 dollars, part of a debt of 2000 dollars, due from him to
them.
Also, a release from Joseph Smith, of same date, releasing
1150 dollars, part of a debt of 3000 dollars, due to him from
said Scholfield.
Also, a release of William Veitch and Benom Wheat, discharging the said Scholfield from 250 dollars, part of a debt of
800 dollars, due to them from him.
Also an engagement of John Lloyd, dated the 25th of April
1828, binding himself to the several persons who executed the
foregoing releases for the several sums released by them, in the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

event of his succeeding in the suit then depending between
himself and Charles Scott, bailiff of William S. Moore.
Also a release from John Lloyd, stating, that whereas Jonathan Scholfield stood indebted to him in a large sum of money;
he had agreed to release, and did thereby release, the said
Seholfield from 5000 dollars, part of the said debt.
In discussing the competency of the witness, some diversity
of opinion prevailed on the question whether he could be received to invalidate a paper executed by himself, but, without deciding this question, a majority of the court is of opinion that he is interested in the event of the suit. His letter
of the 9th of June, to John Lloyd, the tenant in possession, requiring him to withhold from William S. Moore the payment of any farther sum of money, on account of this rent
charge, contains this declaration "and in case distress should
be made upon you for the rent, I promise to save you harmless, if you will resist the payment by writ of replevy. I wish
you to understand, that if you make any further payments after receiving this notice, that you make them at your own risk."
This is an explicit and absolute undertaking, to assume all
the liabilities which Mr Lloyd might incur by suing out a writ
of replevin, if an attempt should be made to levy the rent by
distress. Mr Scholfield then is responsible to Mr Lloyd for the
costs of this suit. This is a plain and substantial interest in
the event of the suit, from which Mr Lloyd alone can release
him. This liability was incurred before the sale and release
from Scholfield to Lloyd of the 13th of June 1831, and Mr
Scholfield's responsibility depended on the decision of the suit
in which he was called as a witness, unless his release to, and
contract with Lloyd of the 13th of June 1831, could discharge
him from it. That contract transferred to Lloyd all the interest of Scholfield, ii the ground charged with the rent to
Moore, but did not transfer with it his obligation to save Lloyd
harmless, for resisting the claim of Moore to the rent in arrear.
It produced a state of things which removed all motives, on
the part of Scholfield, for incurring fresh liabilities, but did not
discharge him from liabilities already incurred. It placed in
his hands the entire management of the suit, but did not enable him to undo what was done, or to relieve himself from the
claim of Moore to costs, should the suit terminate in his favour.
VOL. Ix.-3 P

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

The responsibility of Lloyd to Moore continued, and the correlative responsibility of Scholfield to Lloyd still continued also,
unless Lloyd had released him from it. Now there is no expression in the contracts between the parties, which purports
to be such a release. It has been inferred as the result of the
change in the situation of the parties, but we do not think the
inference justified by the fact. The obligation is unequivocal,
is expressed in plain and positive terms, is dependent on the
event of a suit, and independent of the ownership of the property. The parties enter into a contract by which the property
is transferred, without making any allusion to this obligation.
It remains, we think, in full force, and, consequently, Jonathan
Scholfield was an interested and incompetent witness.
In the progress of the examination, the plaintiff's counsel
put to the witness the following question-" did you, in the
course of your discussions as to the time you were to keep the
money, state your object in the application to be, to have the
use of the 5000 dollars for a limited time Q5
To which the defendant's counsel objected, as being a leading interrogatory. The plaintiff's counsel then varied the
question as follows
"Did you or did you not, in the course of your discussions,
&c." To which the defendant's counsel made the same objection, but the court overruled the objection, and permitted
the question to be put, and the defendant excepts to that
decision.
Although the plaintiff's counsel objected to this question,
and said that he excepted to the opinion of the court, no exception is actually prayed by the party, or signed by the judge.
This court, therefore, cannot consider the exception as actually
taken, and must suppose it was abandoned.
Evidence was given by the plaintiff in replevin, conducing
to prove that the contract between Scholfield and Moore, under which the sum of 5000 dollars was advanced by the latter
to the former, originated in an application for a loan of money;
not for the purchase and sale of a rent charge or annuity.
Scholfield applied to Moore to raise or borrow 5000 dollars,
securing him on an annuity or ground rent for one year" Moore
proposed to let him have the money for ten years on the same
security. After much discussion the parties agreed to split the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

difference, and that Scholfield should keep the money five
years. Scholfield says his first proposition was to allow ten
per cent and to secure it by an annuity or ground rent on the
houses mentibned in the deed. No other interest but ten per
cent was mentioned , Scholfield had no in tenion of selling the
property. It was also in evidence that Moore was a money
lender, and was in the habit of advancing money, secured on.
ground rents or annuities and that Scholfield was a money
borrower, and that the property was an ample security for the
money lent, and for the annuity.
On the part of the avowant, it was proved, that the usual
value of those ground rents or annuities charged on lots in
Alexandria was such as to afford an interest of ten per cent per
annum on the principal sum advanced, and it was admitted by
Scholfield that he gave Moore no promise, stipulation or security for the return of the 5000 dollars, other than is contained
in the deed itself.
Many witnesses were examined, and a great deal of testimony, bearing more or less directly on the contract, was adduced.
The deed from Scholfield and wife to W S. Moore, by
which, in consideration of 5000 dollars, the annuity or rent
charge of 500 dollars per annum was created, contains a covenant "that the said J. Scholfield, his heirs and assigns, will
well and truly pay to the said W S. Moore, his heirs and assigns, the said annuity or rent charge of 500 dollars, by equal
half yearly payments, on the 10th day of June and on the 10th
day of December, in each year, for ever hereafter, as the same
shall become due, and that if the same be not punctually paid,
then it shall be lawful for the said W S. Moore, his heirs and
assigns, from time to time, on every such default, to enter on
the premises charged, and to levy, by distress and sale of the
goods and chattels there found, the rent in arrear and the costs
of distress and sale, and if the same shall remain in arrear and
unpaid for the space of thirty days after any day of payment,
as aforesaid, and no distress sufficient to satisfy the same can
be found on the premises charged, then it shall be lawful for
the said W S. Moore, his heirs and assigns, to enter on the
premises charged, and from thence to remove and expel the
said J. Scholfield, his heirs and assigns, and to hold and enjoy

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

the same as his, and their, absolute estate for ever thereafter." "And that the said J. Seholfield, his heirs and assigns,
will for ever hereafter keep the buildings and improvements
which now are, or hereafter may be erected on the premises
charged, fully insured against fire, in some incorporated insurance office, and will assign the policies of insurance to such
trustees as the said W S. Moore, his heirs or assigns, may
appoint, to the intent that if any damage or destruction from
fire shall happen, the money received on such policies may be
applied to rebuilding or repairing the buildings destroyed or
damaged."
"And lastly, that he and his heirs will for ever warrant and
defend the annuity or rent charge hereby granted to the said
W S. Moore, his heirs and assigns, against any defalcation
or deduction, for or on account of any act of him, his heirs or
assigns."
The deed contained a farther covenant, that if, at any time
after five years, the said J. Scholfield should pay to the said
W S. Moore the sum of 5000 dollars, with all arrears of rent,
&c., the said W S. Moore will execute any deed releasing or
extinguishing the said rent or annuity
When the testimony was closed, the counsel for the defendant and avowant prayed the court to instruct the jury, " that
the contract between said Jonathan Scholfield and William S.
Moore, such as it is evidenced by the deed from said Scholfield
and wife to said Moore, set out in the proceedings, and given
in evidence by the plaintiff as aforesaid, was lawful and free of
the taint of usury, and in order to impeach it of usury, and
support the issues of fact joined in this cause on the part of the
plaintiff, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove, that besides
the contract imported by the terms of said deed, there was an
actual contract between said Seholfield and Moore for the loan
of 5000 dollars at usurious interest, to wit, at the rate of ten
per cent per annum, to be disguised under the form and name
of an annuity or rent charge, and that such sum was actually lent by said Moore to said Scholfield, and said deed given
in pursuance and execution of such contract and loan, securing the said usurious interest under the form and name of such
annuity or rent charge, that the facts given in evidence to the
jury as aforesaid to support the issues above joined on the part

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

of the plaintiff, did not import such a lending of money by
Moore to Scholfield, at usurious interest, as was sufficient to
support the issues joined on the part of the plaintiff in replevin,
upon the second and fourth pleas by the plaintiff in replevin,
pleaded to the cognizance in this case." Which instruction
the court refused to give, to which refusal the defendant
and avowant, by his counsel, prayed an exception, which was
signed.
The substantial merits of the case are involved in the subsequent instructions which the court actually gave, and it will
be apparent when we proceed to the consideration of those instructions, that if they ought to have been given, this ought to
have been refused. There are however, objections to the manner in which these instructions are framed, which ought not to
have been overlooked bythe court. The statute against usurry
not only forbids the direct taking of more than six per centum
per annum for the loan or forbearance of any sum of money,
but it forbids any shift or device, by which this prohibition may
be evaded and a greater interest be in fact secured. If a
larger sum than six per cent be not expressly reserved, the instrument will not of itself expose the usury, but the real corruptness of the contract must be shown by extrinsic circumstances, which prove its character. Those circumstances must
of course be viewed in connection with the contract. The
counsel for the avowant asks the court to separate the instrument from its circumstances, and to inform the jury that the
instrument itself was lawful, and free from the taint of usury,
and that to fix this taint upon it, the plaintiff in replevin must
prove, besides the contract in the deed, an actual contract,
stipulating interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum
for the loan of 5000 dollars. Had this instruction been given,
circumstances which demonstrated the intention of the parties,
and explained completely the contract actually made, if such
existed, must have been disregarded by the jury. The court
is next requested to say to the jury, that the facts given in
evidence did not import such a lending as would support the
issue.
The court is thus asked to usurp the province of the jury, and
to decide on the sufficiency of the testimony, in violation of the
well established principle, that the law is referred to the court,

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

the fact to the jury The court did not err in refusing to give
this instruction.
"The plaintiff then prayed the court further to instruct the
jury, that the matters shown in evidence to the jury as aforesaid, are proper for the consideration of thejury,.to determine,
from the whole evidence, under the instruction of the court, as
already given to them in this cause, whether the said contract
so made between the said Moore and Scholfield was, in substance and effect, a loan at usurious interest, or a bona fide
contract for the bargain and sale of a rent charge, and if the
jury, from the said whole evidence under the instructions as
aforesaid, shall believe it to have been such a loan, they should
find for the plaintiff, if otherwise, for the defendant."
The court gave this instruction, and the defendants excepted
to it. Its correctness is now to be examined.
The statute declares, "that no person shall, upon any contract, take, directly or indirectly, for loan of any money," &c.,
"above the value of six dollars, for the forbearance of one hundred dollars for a year," &c.
It has been settled, that to constitute the offence, there must
be a loan, upon which more than six per cent interest is to be
received, and it is also settled, that where the contract is in
truth for the borrowing and lending of money, no form which
can be given to it will free it from the taint of usury, if more
than legal interest be secured.
The ingenuity of lenders has devised many contrivances, by
which, under forms sanctioned by law, the statute may be
evaded. Among the earliest and most common of these is the
purchase of annuities, secured upon real estate or otherwise.
The statute does not reach these, not only because the principal may be put in hazard, but because it was not the intention
of the legislature to interfere with individuals in their ordinary
transactions of buying and selling, or other arrangements made
-with a view to conveniencD or profit. The purchase of an
annuity therefore, or rent charge, if a bona fide sale, has never
been considered as usurious, though more than six per cent
profit be secured. Yet it is apparent, that if giving this form
to the contract will afford a cover which conceals it from judicial investigation, the statute would become a dead letter.
Courts, therefore, perceived the necessity of disregarding the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

form, and examining into the real nature of the transaction.
If that be in fact a loan, no shift or device will protect it.
Though this pnnciple may be extracted from all the cases,
yet as each depends on its own circumstances, and those circumstances are almost infinitely varied, it ought not to surprise
us if there should be some seeming conflict in the application
of the rule by different judges. Different minds allow a different degree of weight to the same circumstances.
The King v. Drury, 2 Lev. 7, is a very strong case in favour
of the avowant, and has been much pressed on the court by his
counsel.
Brown agreed to assign to Drue a lease of a house for forty
years for the sum of 300 pounds. Drue not having the money, Drury, by agreement with Drue, paid the 300 pounds,
took the assignment to himself, and then let the house to
Drue for thirty-nine and three quarter years, at a rent, of which
30 pounds was payable to himself. Drury covenanted that if
at the end of four years Drue paid the 300 pounds, he would
convey the residue of the term to Drue. Per Hale, C. J.
"This is not usury within the statute, for Drue was not bound
to pay the 300 pounds to Drury." "It is no more in effect than
a bargain for an annuity of 30 pounds yearly, for thirty-nine
and three quarter years, for 300 pounds to be secured in this manner; determinable sooner if the grantor pleases, but the grantee
hath no remedy for his 300 pounds." "And so the acceptance
of the 7 pounds 10 shillings is not usury But if Drury had
taken security for the repayment of the 300 pounds, or it had
been by any collateral agreement to be repaid, and all this
method of bargaining a contrivance to avoid the statute, this
had been usury."
This case has been cited to prove that, without an express
stipulation for the repayment of the money advanced, a contract cannot be usurious, whatever profit may be derived from
it. It must be admitted that although lord Hale does not say
so in terms, the case, as reported, countenances this construction. But the accuracy of the report must be questioned; and
it is believed that such a principle would not now be acknowledged in the courts of England.
Chief Justice Hale considers the transaction simply as a
bargain for an annuity, not as a loan of money. Whether

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

the circumstances of the case warranted this conclusion or not,
it is the conclusion he drew from them. The negotiation between Drue and Drury, by which the latter advanced the
money, became the assignee of the term, and then loaned it
to the former, accompanied with a power of redemption, are
totally overlooked by the judges. It had no influence on the
case. It was not considered as affording any evidence, that
the transaction was in reality a loan of money The principle
of law announced by the judge is simply, that a bargain for an
annuity isnot usury He adds, that if the repayment of the
300 pounds had been secured, and all this method of bargaining a contrivance to avoid the statute, this had been usury"
He connects the bargaining, being a contrivance to avoid
the statute, with a security for the repayment of the sum advanced, as if he thought this security indispensable to the effect
of the bargaining, without which the contract could not be
usurious.
It is obvious that if this inference of law from the fact be
admitted without qualification, it will entirely defeat the statute. If an express stipulation for the repayment of the sum
advanced be indispensable to the existence of usury, he must
be a bungler indeed, who frames his contract on such terms as
to expose himself to the penalties of the law. If a man purchases for 500 dollars an annuity for 200 dollars per annum
redeemable at the will of the grantor in ten years, without
any express stipulation for the repayment of the 500 dollars,
this, according to Drury's case, as reported, would be no more
than a bargain for an annuity; and yet the grantor would receive excessive usury, and the grantee would be compelled, by
the very terms of the contract, to repay the 500 dollars as certainly as if he had entered into a specific covenant for repayment, on which an action could be maintained. Lord Hale
cannot have intended this. He has not said so in terms; and
we must believe that he did not mean to require more than
that the contract should not be such as, in effect, to secure the
principal sum advanced with usurious interest. It would be
a very unusual stipulation in the grant of an annuity, that the
money should be returned otherwise than by the annuity itself.
So in Finch's case, reported in Comyn on Usury 43, Canfield
secured to Finch more than the legal interest on the money

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.3

advanced by a rent issuing out of land, and the court determined that it was not usury, though Canfield had applied for a
loan of money which Finch refused, offering at the same time
to let him have the sum by way of annuity or rent. This was
held not to be usurious. "This," said the court, "is not a contract commenced upon a corrupt cause, but an agreement for a
rent which it is lawful for every one to make." But it was
said, that if twelve pounds in the hundred had been offered to be
paid, (the legal interest was then ten per cent) and the other
had said that he would accept it, but that this would be in
danger of the law, and therefore he did not like to contract
upon these terms, but that if the other party would assure
him an annual rent for his money then he would lend it, and
upon this an agreement for the rent had been made: this would
have been within the statute." The same principle is decided
in Cro. James 252. These cases turn on the evidence which
shall be sufficient to prove a loan to be the foundation of the
contract, but do not withdraw the casefrom the statute, if a loan
be its foundation. They decide that a mere application for a
loan does not convert a subsequent annuity, which yields a
profit beyond legal interest, into a usurious contract, but that
an actual contract for the loan, if converted into an annuity in
order to avoid the law, is within the statute.
In these cases the court decides upon the fact, and determines
that a variation in it, the importance of which is not distinctly
perceived, would bring the contract within the law. In all of
them, we think it probable, that a court of the present day
would leave it to the jury to say, whether the contract was a
fair purchase or a loan, and would direct the jury to find for
the plaintiff or defendant, as their opinion on that fact might be.
In Fuller's case, 4 Leon. 208, and in Symonds v. Cockrell,
Noy 151 and Brownlow 180, a distinction is taken between
the purchase of an annuity without any communication
respecting a loan, and a purchase where the negotiation
commences with an application to borrow money, though no
contract of loan followed such application.
In a case, between Murray and Harding, reported in
Comyns on Usury 51, Markham, an attorney, at the request of
Robert Harding, rector of Grafton Regis, applied to Mrs Mary
Murray, to lay out 120 pounds in the purchase of an annuity
VOL. ix.-3

450

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

of 20 pounds a year for the defendant's life, charged on his
rectory of Grafton, redeemable -by him at the end of the first
five years upon the payment of 109 pounds 10 shillings.
There was no communication with her about a loan, but
merely about the purchase of such redeemable annuity, although Harding had mentioned to his attorney Markham, a
wish to borrow 100 pounds or upwards.
This case was brought before the court. In giving his opinion on it, Chief Justice De Grey said, "communication concerning a loan has sometimes infected the case and turned the
contract into usury, but then the communication must be
mutual." "I know no case where even a meditated loan has
been bona fide converted into a purchase, and afterwards held
to be usurious. To be sure it is a strong and suspicious circumstance, but if the purchase comes out to be clearly a bona
fide purchase, it will notwithstanding be good."
"If a power of redemption be given, though only to one side,
it is a strong circumstance to show it a loan, as in Lawley v.
Hooper. But that alone will not be conclusive."
The chief justice added, "i11 the present case the principal
is precarious and secured only by the life of a clergyman, and
his continuing to be beneficed."
In Lawley v. Hooper, 2 Atk. 278, Thomas Lawley, being
entitled to an annuity of 200 pounds a year for life, sold 150
pounds, part thereof, to Rowland Davenant for 1050 pounds,
with power to repurchase, on giving six months notice. After
the death of Davenant, Lowry brought this bill against his executors for an account, -and that upon payment of what should
be due, the defendants might reassign the annuity to the
plaintiff.
In giving his opinion, the chancellor said, "there has been
a long struggle between the equity of this court, and persons
who have made it their endeavour to find out schemes to get
exorbitant interest and to evade the statutes of usury- The
court very wisely hath never laid down any general rule beyond
which it will not go."
"In this case there are two questions to be considered. 1.
Whether this assignment is to be considered as an absolute sale,
or a security for a loan.
"As to the first, I think, though there is no occasion to de-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

termine it, there is a strong foundation for considering it a loan
of money, and I really believe in my conscience, that ninetynine in a hundred of these bargains are nothing but loans,
turned into this shape to avoid the statutes of usury."
The chancellor then proceeds to state the circumstances
under which the contract was made, and the character of the
contract itself; and although there was no treaty about a loan,
he considers it as one. After enumerating the circumstances,
he concludes with saying, "therefore, upon all the circumstances, I think it was, and is to be taken as a loan of money
turned into this shape, only to avoid the statute of usury, but
I do not think I am under any absolute necessity to determine
this point, for I am of opinion that this is such an agreement
as this court ought not to suffer to stand, taking it as an abso-,
lute sale." The relief asked by the plaintiff in his bill, was
granted.
In the noted case of Chesterfield, Executor of Spencer v.
Janssen, reported in 1 Atk. and 1 Wils., 5000 pounds was
advanced by Janssen, on the bond of Mr Spencer, to pay
10,000 pounds should he survive the duchess of Marlborough.
After the death of Mr Spencer, this bond was contested by his
executor, and one of the points made was, that it was usurious. The cause was argued with great ability, and determined
not to be within the statutes, because the principal was in
hazard. In giving this opinion, the judges define usury in
terms applicable to the present case. "To make this contract
usurious," said Mr Justice Burnet, "it must be either because
it is within the express words, or an evasion or shift to keep out
of the statutes." "Whatever shift is used for the forbearance or
giving day of payment, will make an agreement usurious; and
is by a court and jury esteemed a colour only. Suppose a man
purchase an annuity at ever such an under price; if the bargain
was really for an annuity, it is not usury. If on the foot of
borrowing and lending money, it is otherwise, for if the court
are of opinion the annuity is not the real contract, but a method
of paying more money for the reward or interest than the law
allows, it is a contrivance that shall not avoid the statute."
The lord chancellor said, "if there has been a loan of money,
and an insertion of a contingency which gives a higher rate of
interest than the statutes allow, and the contingency goes to

SUPREMt COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

the interest only, though real and not colourable, and notwithstanding it be a hazard, yet it has been held usurious. Where
the contingency has related to both principal and interest, and
a higher interest taken than allowed by the statute, the courts
have then inquired whether it was colourable or not."
Wilson reports the chancellor to have said, "courts regard
the substance and not the mere words of contracts. Loans, on
a fair contingency to risk the whole money, are not within the
statute, a man may purchase an annuity as low as possible,
but if the treaty be about borrowing and lending, and the annuity only colourable, the contract may be usurious, however
disguised."
Richards qui tam v. Brown, Cowper 770, was an action on
the statute of usury. Richard Heighway applied to Brown for
a loan of money, to which Brown assented, and advanced part
of the money, promising to advance the residue, being 400
pounds, in a fortnight. After some delays, Brown said he
could not raise the money himself, but would try to get it of a
friend, in the city, who was a hard man. Heighway said he
would give twenty or thirty guineas rather than nfot have the
money. Brown said, "that his friend never lent money but
on an annuity at six years purchase. However," he added, "if
you will take the money on those terms, I will engage to furnish you with money to redeem in three months' time." Heighway executed a bond and warrant of attorney, for conveying the
annuity to one Waters. The money was really advanced by
Brown, and the name of Waters was used by him. Heighway
deposed that Brown first proposed the annuity He himself
would not have granted one. Heighway pressed for the money
to redeem, but Brown refused it.
Lord Mansfield told the jury that if theywere satisfied, "that,
in the true contemplation of the parties, this transaction was a
purchase by the one, and a sale by the other, of a real annuity,
how much soever they might disapprove of, or condemn the
defendant's conduct, they must find a verdict for him. But on
the contrary, if it appeared to them to have been in reality and
truth, the intention of both parties, the one to borrow and the
other to lend, and that the form of an annuity was only a
mode forced on the necessity of the borrower by the lender,
under colour of which he might take an usurious and exorbit-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

ant advantage, then they might find for the plaintiff, notwithstanding the contingency of the annuitant dying within three
months."
The jury found for the plaintiff.
On a motion for a new trial, lord Mansfield said, "the question is, what was the substance of the transaction and the true
intent and meaning of the parties, for they alone are to govern,
and not the words used. The substance here was plainly a
borrowing and lending. Heighway had no idea of selling an
annuity, but his declared obiect was to borrow money." "It
is true there was a contingency during three months. It was
that which occasioned the doubt, whether a contingency for
three months is sufficient to take it out of the statute."
The new trial was granted.
In the case of Irnham v. Child, I Br. Ch. Rep. 93, lord
Thurlow is reported to have said (referring to previous dicta),
"all therefore that seems to be meant is this, that the annuity
shall be absolutely sold without any stipulation for the return
of the principal, and that it shall not be intended as a means
of paying interest until such principal is returned. But where
there is a sale it is not usurious to make it redeemable."
In Drew v. Power, I Schoales and Lefroy 182, the plaintiff
being much embarrassed in his circumstances, communicated
to the defendant his desire to raise money to extricate himself
from his debts. After approving his purpose and increasing
sufficiently his anxiety for its accomplishment, the defendant
informed him that two of his estates, Poulagower and Knockavin, would shortly be out of lease, and that if he would
make the defendant a lease of them for three lives, at the rent
of 200 pounds per annum, he would, from friendship, advance
him money sufficient to pay all his debts. The plaintiff
assented to this proposition. The bill then proceeds to charge
much unfairness and oppression on the part of the defendant
.nmaking advances towards paying the debts of the plaintiff,
and states that he claimed a balance of 1015 pounds and 15
shillings, for which he demanded the plaintiff's bond. This
was given. The defendant then required a lease for Poulagower and Knockavin, which was executed for three young
lives, at the rent of 200 pounds per annum, which was greatly
below their value. The defendant also obtained other leases

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

from the plaintiff. The bill details a great variety of other
transactions between the parties, which are omitted as being
inapplicable to the case now before this court. The bill was
brought for a full settlement of accounts, and that on payment
of the balance fairly due to the defendant, the leases he had
obtained from the plaintiff might be set aside.
The defendant, in his answer, denied the charges of oppressive and iniquitous conduct set up in the bill, and insisted that
the lands called Poulagower and Knockavin, having been advertised to be let, he agreed to take them at a valuation, and
insisted that he paid a fair rent for them.
The cause came on to be heard before the master of the
rolls, who directed several issues to try whether the full and
fair value of the lands were reserved on the leases granted by
the plaintiff to the defendant, and whether either, and which
of them were executed, in consideration of any and what loan
of money, and from whom.
The case was carried before the lord chancellor, who disapproved the issues, and gave his opinion at large on the case.
After commenting on the testimony respecting the leases, he
says, "Hastings has distinctly proved, that the loan of money
was the inducement to this lease, and if it was, it vitiates the
whole transaction. I do not mean advancing money by way
of fine or the like, but where iLis a distinct loan of money to
a distressed man, for which security is to be taken, and he is
still to continue a debtor for it. If I were to permit this to be
considered asa transaction which oughtto stand, Ishould permit
a complete evasion of the statute of usury" The chancellor
concluded a strong view of the testimony, 9howing a loan of
money to be the consideration on which the leases were granted, with saying, "there is no reason to send this case to a
jury." "There is sufficient to satisfy the conscience of the
court, that these leases ought not to stand."
The case of Marsh v. Martindale, 1 Bos. and Pul. 153, was a
judgment on a bond for 5000 pounds. The consideration on
which the bond was given, was a bill drawn by Robert Wood
on Martindale, Filet & Co., for 5000 pounds, payable three
years after date. The bill was accepted, the interest discounted by Sir Charles Marsh, and the residue of the money paid to

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.I

Martindale, for the purpose of enabling him to discharge certain annuities for which he was liable.
On a motion for a new trial, lord Alvanley, chief justice,
said, "it was contended that the transaction was to all intents
a purchase of an annuity, and this certainly was the strongest
ground which the plaintiff could take; for it has been determined in all the cases on the subjpct, that a purchase of an
annuity, however exorbitant the terms may be, can never
amount to usury. But if the transaction respecting the annuity
be under cover for the advancement of money by way of loan,
it will not exempt the lender from the penalty of the statute,
or prevent the securities from being void. Then is this transaction the purchase of an annuity or is it not V After restat-.
ing the transaction.the judge asked "what is this but forbearing for three years to take the sum of 4250 pounds, for which
forbearance, he was to receive interest on 5000 pounds."
The judge referred to the case in Noy 151, as applicable to
this. "There," he said, "a question having arisen, whether a
deed securing arent chargewere void for usury, the court agreed
that if the original contract were to have a rent charge, that is
not usury, but a good bargain, but if the party had come to
borrow the money, and then such a bargain had ensued by
security, then that is usury."
Doe, on the demise of Grimes et al., assignees of Hammond
(a bankrupt) v. Gooch, was an ejectment. Hammond had
taken ground on a building lease at the rent of 108 pounds
per annum. He assigned the premises to Roberts for 2300
pounds, a sum considerably above their then value, and at the
same time took a lease from Roberts at the increased rent of
395 pounds, containing the same covenants for building as
were in the original lease, together with a stipulation that he
should be at liberty, on giving six months notice, to re-purchase the premises at the same price for which he had sold
them to Roberts. Hammond completed the houses, and, having become a bankrupt, his assignees brought this action
against the tenant of Roberts. The judge left it to the jury to
say whether the transaction between Hammond and Roberts
was, substantially, a purchase or a loan, and told them, "that
if they thought it was a loan, the deeds were void, the transacaction being usunous." The jury found a verdict for the plain-

SUPREME COURT.
[Scott v. Lioyd.]

tiff. On a motion for a new trial, counsel contended that the
deeds imported a purchase. That the principal money was
altogether gone, unless Hammond chose to redeem, and,
though it may be his interest so to do, this will not make it an
usurious transaction. If a person have-an annuity secured on
a freehold estate, it may be clearly his interest to redeem it,
but such a power will not make the bargain usurious. Here
Bailey, justice, observed, "in that case the principal is in hazard
from the uncertain duration of life. Here it is in the nature
of an annuity for years, and there is no case in which an annuity for years has been held not to be usurious, where, on
calculation, it appeared that more than the principal, together
with legal interest, is to be received."
The new trial was refused.
In the case of Low v. Waller, Doug. 735, lord Mansfield told
the jury, "that the statute of usury was made to protect men
who act with their eyes-open, to protect them against themselves." "They were to consider whether the transaction was
not in truth a loan of money, and the sale of goods a mere contrivance and evasion."
The jury found the contract to be usurious. On a motion
for a new trial, lord Mansfield said, "the only question in all
cases like the present, is, what is the real substance of the transaction, not what is the colour and form."
Gibson v. Fristoe, I Call 62, was an action of debt brought
by Gibson against Fristoe et al., in the district court of Duinfries. Issue was joined on the plea of the statute of usury
Verdict and judgment for the defendant, and appeal to the
court of appeals.
The case was shortly this, John Fristoe being indebted to
John Gibson, by bond, for 445 pounds 1 shillings and 2 pence
sterling, on the 17th of December 1787, assigned him bonds of
perfectly solvent obligors fr 780 pounds currency, at the agreed
value of 382 pounds 8 shillings and 2 pence sterling, and gave
a new bond with two sureties for a balance of 106 pounds 17
shillings and 2 pence sterling, payable in March following.
Mr Washington, for the appellant, said, "in all these cases
the first inquiry is, if there be a loan. I admit that if a real
loan is endeavoured to be covered under any disguise whatever, it is still usury." He contended that here was no loan,
"but a purchase of property, for bonds are property."

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

In giving his opinion, Mr Pendleton, the president of the
court of appeals, said, "an agreement by which a man secures
to himself, directly or indirectly, a higher premium than six
per cent for the loan of money, or the forbearance of a debt, is
usury. If the principal or any considerable part be put in risk,
it is not usury, because the excess in the premium is the consideration of that risk." "But if the bargain proceeds from
and is connected with a treaty for the loan or forbearance of
money, it is usury; because the vendor is supposed to have subnitted to a disadvantageous price under the influence of that
necessity which the statute meant to protect him against."
The judgment of the circuit court was affirmed.
Clarkson's Administrator v Garland, and another reported
in 1 Leigh, was a bill in chancery, brought by the plaintiff to
be relieved against several contracts, bonds and deeds of trust,
alleged to be usurious. The bill states numerous usurious and
oppressive transactions, which are generally and particularly
denied in the answers. -Testimony was taken, and the case,
so far as it is applicable in principle to that under consideration, is thus stated.
Clarkson, wanting to raise 2235 dollars, applied to Jacobs,
and offered him as many slaves as would command that sum.
Jacobs advanced him, on the 23d of March 1815, 2335 dollars,
and took an absolute bill of sale for sixteen slaves. It was at
the same time agreed that the slaves should remain in Clarkson's possession on hire for one year, and if at the end of the
year, Clarkson shall pay Jacobs 2935 dollars, Jacobs shall, in
consideration thereof, resell the slaves to him. The plaintiff
charged that his application to Jacobs was to borrow money,
and that the substance of the transaction was a loan, reserving
a higher interest than is allowed by law.
On the 22d of May, Clarkson again applied to Jacobs, and
obtained from him the further sum of 2666 dollars and 26 cents.
For this sum he also gave Jacobs a bill of sale for fourteen
slaves, redeemable by the payment of 3394 dollars, on or before the 23d of March 1816.
The plaintiff avers that this also was a loan, and that the
pretended sale of slaves was a device to cover the taking of
usurious interest.

Jacobs, in his answer, avers that both contracts were in truth
what they purport to be, bona fide agreements to purchase and
resell the slaves therein mentioned.
The slaves not being redeemed, Garland, with full knowledge of the usury, as the bill charges, became jointly interested
with Jacobs in both contracts. In August 1816, they procured
Clarkson's bond for 7000 dollars, being the aggregate of both
debts, With farther usury for forbearance.
The court declared both contracts to be usurious.
Douglass v. M'Chestey, 2 Randolph 109, was a bill, to be
relieved from two bonds and a deed of trust, given by the
plaintiff -to the defendant.
The bill states that Douglass
applied to M'Chesney to borrow 500 dollars, M'Chesney
replied that it was, his practice, whenever he lent money, to
sell a horse, which Douglass professed his willingness to purchase. Some time afterwards the complainant went by appointment to the house of M'Chesney, who showed him a
horse for which he asked 400 dollars. The plaintiff avers that
the horse was not worth more than 80 or 100 dollars, but
urged by his necessities, and knowing that he could not get
the 500 dollars from M'Chesney, without giving his price for
the horse, he assented to the proposal, and executed two bonds
for the money, which were secured by a deed of trust. When
the bonds became due, M'Chesney advertised the property for
sale, and this bill was brought to enjoin farther proceedings,
and to be relieved.
The testimony proved that the horse was not worth more
than 100 dollars, and that it was reported to be M'Chesney's
practice when he lent money, to sell a horse at an exorbitant
price to cover an usurious gain.
The chancellor dissolved the injunction, and the plaintiff
appealed.
The court of appeals was of opinion that a tacit understandiug between the parties, founded on a known practice of the
appellee to lend money at legal interest, if the borrower purchased of him a horse at an unreasonable price, would be a
shift to evade the statute of usury.
The decree was reversed, but the court being of opinion
that the questions of fact would be decided more understandingly by a jury on viva voce testimony, remanded the cause

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

to the court of chancery, with directions to have issues tried
to ascertain the value of the horse, and whether Douglass was
induced to purchase him at the price of 400 dollars by the expectation of a loan.
The covenants in the deed of the I1th of June 1814, granting the annuity, have been stated. They secure the payment
of ten per cent for ever on the sum advanced. There is no
hazard whatever in the contract. Moore must, in something more than twenty years, receive the money which he
advanced to Scholfield, with the legal interest on it, unless
the principal sum should be returned after five years, in which
event, he would receive the principal with ten per cent interest
till repaid. The deed is equivalent to a bond for 5000 dollars,
amply secured by a mortgage on real property, with interest
thereon at ten per centum per annum, with liberty to repay
the principal in five years. If the real contract was for a loan
of money, without any view to a purchase,it is plainly within
the statute of usury; and this fact was very properly left to the
jury. There is no error in this instruction.
The counsel for the defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they shall believe from the evidence
aforesaid, that the land out of which the said rent charge mentioned in said deed from Scholfield to Moore was to issue, was
in itself, and independently of the buildings upon the same,
wholly inadequate and insufficient security for said rent,
that then the jury cannot legally infer, from the clause in said
deed, containing a covenant on the part of said Scholfield to
keep the said houses insured, any thing affecting said contract
with usury or illegality, which instruction the court refused
whereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury as
follows, to wit, that if the jury shall believe, from the evidence,
that the fair and customary price of annuities and rent charges,
at the date of the said deed from Scholfield, was in the market
of Alexandria ten years' purchase, and so continued for a period of years, then, from the circumstances of the rent being
ten per centum on the amount advanced, the jury cannot
legally infer from such circumstance, any thing usurious or
illegal in the contract.
But the court refused to grant the said instructions, or either
of them, as prayed by the counsel for the defendant, whereiipon,

SUPREME COURT
[Scott v. Lloyd.]

the said counsel excepted to the said opinion of the court, and
its refusal to give either of the said instructions as prayed.
It is obvious that the instructions given by the court, at the
prayerof the plaintiff's counsel, cover the whole matter contamed in this prayer of the defendant. It is, in truth, an effort to separate the circumstances of the case from each other,
and to induce the court, after directing the jury that they
ought to be considered together, to instruct them that, separately, no one of them amounted in itself to usury The court
ought not to have given this instruction. It was proper to
submit the case, with all its circumstances, to the consideration of the jury, and to leave the question whether the contract was, in truth, a loan, or the bona fidt purchase of an
annuity, to them.
There is no error in the opinion of the court refusing the
second and fourth instructions prayed by the defendant and
avowant in the court below, nor in giving the instructions
prayed by the plaintiff in replevin, but this court is of opinion,
that the circuit court erred in deciding that Jonathan Scholfield was a competent witness for the plaintiff in that court.
This court doth, therefore, determine, that the judgment of the
circuit court be reversed and annulled, and that the cause be
remanded to that court with directions to set aside the verdict,
and award a venire facias de novo.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in and for the county of Washington,
and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it is
ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the
said circuit court m this cause be, and the same is hereby reversed and annulled, and that this cause be and the same is
hereby remanded to the said circuit court with directions to
set aside the verdict and award a venire facias de novo.
