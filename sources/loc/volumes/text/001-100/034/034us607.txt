T D. OwiNGs,
HULL.

Mrs Van Pradelles being in New Orleans, and about to sail for Baltimore, made
her last will and testament, and appointed her sisters residing in Baltimore,
executrixes of her will. At the time of her decease, she had real and personal estate, including some slaves, in New Orleans, and she left a number
of children. She sailed from Now Orleans, and was never heard of after
she left that place. The executrixes, after some time, supposing her dead,
proved the will in Baltimore; and in 1816, gave a power of attorney to
John K. West, of New Orleans, to receive all the moneys due the estate of
their testatrix, and particularly to cause such proceedings to be instituted
as might be necessary to effect a sale of the estate, and to give a deed for
the same, and generally to perform all acts in the premises, judicially and
extra-judicially, for the effectual settlement of the estate, &c. West obtained letters testamentary from the court of probate in New Orleans, authorizing him to collect the estate, and to do all lawful acts as attorney in
fact of the executrixes. He sold the slaves belonging to the estate to Mr
Hull, in February 1817, for 1800 dollars, by a bill of sale executed before
a notary; and all the purchase money, except 450 dollars paid to one of
the children of the testatrix, was paid to him; and he, soon after, failed,
without having paid over any part of the proceeds of the sale to the executrixes. This sale was communicated to Mr Winchester, the attorney of the
executrixes, and by him to them. In 1826 a suit was brought in the parish
court of New Orleans by the children and heirs of Mlrs Van Pradelles against
Hull, according to the laws of Louisiana, for the delivery and possession of
the slaves so sold, in which suit, carried afterwards to the supreme court
of the state, the slaves were decreed to the plaintiffs, upon the ground that
the sale was absolutely void under the laws of Louisiana; as executrixes
can only sell after an order of court, and by auction , and in this case the
requisites of the law were not complied with. Hull brought this suit in the
circuit court against the executrixes, to recover from them the purchase
money paid for the slaves, and his expenses attending the same. The whole
proceedings in the Louisiana suit, and the evidence in the same, were read
to the jury by agreement, subject to all legal exceptions.
The defendants excepted to the reading in evidence of the record in the case
of the Heirs of the testatrix v. Hull, as not evidence in the present suit
except as to the judgment, that is, the pleadings and proceedings on which
the judgment was founded, and to which as matter of record it necessarily
refers. By the Court. This objection was well taken. The suit was res
inter alios acta, and the proceedings, and judgment thereon, were no further
evidence, than to show a recovery against Hull by a paramount title.
A copy of the bill of sale of the slaves from West to Hull, on record in the
notary's office in New Orleans, was offered in evidence. No evidence to
account for the non production of the original, was offered by the plaintiff;
but, by the laws of Louisiana, copies of such notarial acts are evidence, the

SUPREME COURT.
[Owings v. Hull.]
original always remaining, by the law of Louisiana, in the office of the
notary. Held, that the circuit court was bound to take judicial notice of
the laws of Louisiana, and'that the copy being evidence by those laws, was
evidence in this case.
The circuit courts of the United States are created by congress, not for the
purpose of administering the local law of a single state alone, but to administer the laws of all the states in the union, in cases to which they
respectively apply. The judicial power conferred on the general government by the constitution, extends to many cases arising under the laws of
the different states , and this court is called upon, in the exercise of its
appellate jurisdiction, constantly to take notice of, and administer the jurisprudence of all the states. That jurisprudence is then in no just sense a
foreign jurisprudence to be proved in the courts of the United States, by
the ordinary modes of proof by which the laws of a foreign country are to
be established; but it is to be judicially taken notice of in the same, as the
laws of the United States are taken notice of in those courts.
A copy of the letters testamentary granted by the parish court of New
Orleans, was proved by the, oath of the clerk and register of the court of
probates ,to be a true copy of the original, and that he could not send the
original, which is on file in the court of probates. By the Court. This is
the best evidence which the nature of the case admits of.
The letters and accounts of J. K. West, the attorney in fact of the executrixes,
transmitted by him to Mr Winchester, their attorney in fact, were legal
evidence in the circuit court.
In order torecover againstthe executrixes on thispointthe plaintiff should have
proved that the sale of the slaves made to him by West, was in conformity with the laws of the state of Louisiana, and, subsequent to such a sale,
a recovery of the slaves from him. Every authority given to an agent or
attorney to transact business for his principal must, in the absence of any
counter proof, be construed to be to transact it according to the laws of the
place where it is to be done. A sale of slaves authorized to be made in
Louisiana by an executrix, must be presumed to be intended to be done us
the manner required by the laws of that state to give it validity; and the
purchaser, equally with the seller, is bound under these circumstances to
know what the laws are, and to be governed thereby. The law will never
presume that parties intend to violate its precepts.
This is not the case of a general agency created by persons acting in autre
droit. The purchaser was therefore bound to see whether the agent acted
within the scope of his powers, and at all events, lie was bound to know
that the agent could not, in virtue of any general power, do any act which
was not in conformity with the laws of Louisiana. The principals could
never be presumed to authorize him to violate those laws, and the purchaser,
purchasing a title invalid by those laws, must have purchased it with full
knowledge.
A ratification of the unauthorized acts of an attorney in fact, without a full
knowledge of all the facts connected with those acts, is not binding on the
principals. No doctrine is better settled on principle and authority, than
this, that the ratification of the act of an agent previously unauthorized,
must, in order to bind the principal, be with a full knowledge of all the
material facts. If the material facts be either suppressed or unknown,
the ratification is invalid, because founded on mistake or fraud.

[Owings v. Hull.]

IN error to the circuit court of the United States for the district of Maryland.
The facts of the case, as stated in the opinion of court, were
"The original suit is an action of assumpsit brought by the
defendant in error against the plaintiffs in error (the original
defendants); the declaration containing the money counts, an
instmul computassent and a special count, as for a deceit in
the title upon a sale of certain slaves.
"Upon the trial under the general issue, the facts appeared as
follows Mrs Van Pradelles, a sister of the plaintiffs in error,
being at New Orleans, in July 1813, made her will, describing herself to be of Baltimore county, in the state of Maryland,
and thereby bequeathed all her estate, equally, among her
children named in the will, and appointed the plaintiffs in
error, executrixes of her will. She immediately after sailed
from New Orleans, bound, as is supposed, for Baltimore, and
has never since been heard of. In May 1815, the plaintiffs
proved the will in the orphan's court of Baltimore county, and
took administration of the estate. The property of Mrs Van
Pradelles, at New Orleans, consisted of real and personal estate,
and among other things, of some slaves, and in January
1816, the executrixes gave a power of attorney to John K.
West ofNew Orleans, to receive and give receipts, &c. for all
the goods, &c. belonging to the estate, to receive all sums of
money, &c., and particularly 'to cause such proceedings to be
instituted, as may be necessary to effect a sale of the whole
real and personal estate of which C. D. Van Pradelles, the testatrix, was seised or possessed at the time of her death, and to
execute, &c. a good and sufficient deed, &c. in the name of the
executrixes, for the purpose of transferring all the right and title
of the heirs of the testatrix therein or thereto, to the purchaser of
the said estate, and generally to do, negotiate and perform all
other acts, matters and thingsin the premises, that circumstances
may require, as well judicially, as extra-judicially, for the effectual settlement of the estate, &c.' West, in January 1817,
obtained from the court of probates of the parish of New Orleans, letters testamentary, authorising him to collect the
goods and effects of the testatrix, and to make a just inventory
thereof, and to do all other lawful acts as attorney in fact of

the executrixes. In February 1817, West sold the slaves in
question, belonging to the estate, to Hull, the defendant in
error, for 1800 dollars, by a bill of sale, duly executed before a
notary in New Orleans 1350 dollars, part of the consideration
money, was duly paid to West, who afterwards failed in 1819,
but it did not appear in the evidence, that any part of the
money had ever come to the hands of the executrixes 450
dollars was, after the failure of West, received by Mrs Donaldson, one of the children and devisees of Mrs Van Pradelles.
The sale was communicated to Mr Winchester, the attorney
of the executrixes, and by him to the latter, and the correspondence between Winchester and West is found in the record. In 1826, a suit was brought in the parish court of New
Orleans, by the heirs of the testatrix, against Hull, according
to the laws of Louisiana, for the delivery and possession of the
slaves so sold, and their offspring, upon which such proceedings were had, that a recovery was decreed to the plaintiffs
in that suit, by the supreme court of the state, upon the
ground, that the sale of the slaves was absolutely void, because, by the laws of Louisiana, executrixes can only sell after
an order of court and by public auction, and not by private
sale, and that here there was no order of court, no sale at
auction, but a sale by private contract."
The plaintiff, to support the issue on his part, offered in evidence the record of the proceedings in the parish court of the
city of New Orleans, in the case in which the children and
heirs of Mrs Van Pradelles were petitioners, against James F
Hull, for the recovery of the slaves sold to him by John K.
West, which proceedings were certified according to the provisions of the act of congress. This record contained a duly
certified notarial copy of the act of sale of the slaves, dated 27th
of August 1817, by John K. West, attorney in fact of the executrixes -of Mrs Van Pradelles, to James F Hull. The original,
of which this was a copy, was the notarial register of the sale
recorded by the notary, and in his possession according to the
laws of Louisiana.
It also contained certain depositions, taken and used as evidence in the cause and documentary proof, such as the
letters of J. K. West, to J. F Hull, J. F Hull, to J. K.
West, letters from G. Winchester, the counsel of the execu-

[Owings v. HulI.J

trixes of Mrs Van Pradelles, and afterwards their attorney in
fact, to J. K. West, on the subject of the estate of the testatrix,
powers of attorney from the executrixes to J. K. West, and
Mr Winchester, a copy of the petition of J. K. West, tQ the
court of probates of New Orleans, for letters of executorship,
and the order of the court thereon, and the letters testamentary granted on the said petition, the accounts of J. K. West,
with the executrixes, the correspondence of Mr Winchester
with Morgan, Dorsey and Company on the affairs of West after
his failure, and the proceedings of the supreme court of Louisiana, on the appeal of J. F Hull from the parish court.
The plaintiff in the circuit court also gave in evidence, a
commission issued to New Orleans and executed there, containing the examination of Martin Blache, register of wills in
and for the parish of New Orleans, and ex officio clerk of the
court of probates, with a copy of the original power of attorney
to John K. West from the executrixes, deposited in the court
of probates; under which power of attorney, John K. West
had acted in the prernisses. The defendants objected to their
admissibility, and presented the following obje9tions, which
were overruled by the court.
1. That the record in tke case of Donaldson v. Hull, in the
parish court of New Orleans, is not evidence in this cause
against the defendants, except as to the judgment of the court
in Louisiana.
2. The copy of the original bill of sale, on record in the
notary's office, is not evidence, unless the plaintiff accounts
for the non production of the original.
3. That to make the act of sale evidence, it must appear,
by the laws of Louisiana, properly and legally proven, that the
original act of sale, of which it purports to be a copy, is in the
custody of a public depository, and cannot be adduced in evidence.
4. The depositions and documentary proof contained in the
record, in the cause of Donaldson v. Hull, are not evidence
against the defendants in this cause.
5. That the papers referred to in the testimony of Martin
Blache, purporting to be letters testamentary granted by the
court of probates to John K. West, are not legal evidence in
this case against the defendants.

SUPREME COURT.
[Owings v. Hull.]

6. The evidence of Mr Winchester, with regard to the letters, and the account of Mr West, transmitted by him, are not
admissible in evidence.
And the defendants, by their counsel, offered the following
prayers:
1. The defendants, by their counsel, prayed the court to
direct the jury that there is no evidence in the cause to show
that John K. West had any authority from the defendants in
this cause to effect a sale of any property belonging to the estate of their testatrix in Louisiana, except in conformity with
the laws of said state, and that unless the plaintiff shows a
sale to the plaintiff Hull, by West, in conformity with those
laws, and a subsequent recovery from Hull, he is not entitled
to recover.
2. The defendants, by their counsel, prayed the court to
direct the jury, that unless they believe that John K. West
strictly complied with the special instructions given him by
the defendants in the power of attorney of January 30th 1816,
and caused such legal proceedings to be instituted as were
necessary to effect a sale of the personal estate of which their
testatrix died possessed in Louisiana, and, under such legal
proceedings, made sale of certain slaves, being part of the said
personal estate, to J. F Hull, the plaintiff in this cause, and
the said slaves were subsequently recovered from the said
Hull, that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.
Thereupon, the plaintiff's counsel, on their part, contended
and insisted that the commission and the return first herein
referred to are legal and competent evidence to prove a recovery of the slaves from the plaintiff, by due course of law,
for a defect of title in the defendants, and John K. West, their
agent and attorney, and of the plaintiff, who claimed under
the said defendants and their said agent as aforesaid.
And also moved the followed prayers to the court.
1. The acts of John K. West, relative to the sale of certain
slaves to the plaintiff in this case, in Louisiana, which were
made known to the defendants, and were assented to, and acquiesced in by them, are binding upon the defendants, as West's
principals whether those acts did or did not conform to a letter of attorney previously given by the defendants to West.
2. The accounts furnished, by John K. West to the defen-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

dants, and retained by them, and no item objected to therein,
except the charge of five per cent commissions, are proper and
legal evidence of the nature and particulars of the transactions
between West and the defendants, so far as these transactions
are therein detailed, except as to the charge for commissions.
3. The letters of George Winchester, written by the direction and with the approbation of the defendants, to West, and
to Morgan, Dorsey and Company, and by them respectively
received, and the instructions given to Winchester by the
defendants, and by him communicated to West, are proper
and legal evidence in this case.
And thereupon the circuit court gave the following opinion.
"The action in this case was brought to recover a sum of
money, paid by the plaintiff, for certain slaves purchased by
him of John K. West, attorney of the defendants, as executors
of Mrs Van Pradelles, a sister. This sale was declared void
by the supreme court of the state of Louisiana, where the sale
was made, for reasons stated in the opinion of the court, that
the sale was made without an order of court, and was not
made at public auction.
"The counsel for the defendants contend that, as the sale
was not made according to the laws of Louisiana, and was
adjudged to be void by the court of that state, the proceedings
of the attorney were void for that reason, and that West, being a special agent, did not pursue the instructions of his constituents, but acted contrary to them.
"The counsel for the plaintiff insists, that the instructions of
the defendants to their attorney were pursued, and that, whether they were special or general, they were ratified by the defendants, and therefore binding on them, and that the plaintiff
in this suit is entitled to recover the money paid by him for
the slaves thus sold.
"Whether an agent has a general, or only a special authority, is properly matter of evidence for the consideration of a
jury. If an agent exceeds his authority, or if he acts without
authority, if the employer subsequently acquiesces in, or approves his conduct, he is bound by it, and a small matter will
be evidence of such assent. And if, with a knowledge of all
the circumstances, an employer adopts the acts of his agent,

SUPREME COURT.
LOwrngs v. Hull.]

for a moment, he is bound by them. But the great principle
inthis cause, is this that where one of two innocent persons
must suffer by the fraud or act of a third, he who enabled that
person, by giving him credit, to commit the fraud, or to do the
act, ought to be the sufferer. In this case, it does not appear
by the evidence given, that West, the attorney, had or had
not taken letters of administration on the estate of Mrs Van
Pradelles. The fact is not noticed in the opinion of the
court. The court of Louisiana declare the sale void, because
made without an order of the court, and not at public auction.
We know that, in Maryland, after letters are granted, the executor, or administrator, in many cases, cannot sell slaves
without an order of court. This court will not presume that
letters of administration were granted to the attorney, much
less will they presume that they were not granted. The
course of proceeding in the courts of Louisiana, is according to
the principles of the civil law. In our state, it is different.
With these indications of the opinion of the court, the jury are
instructed, that if they berleve, from the evidence, that the
acts of John K. West, the attorney of the defendants, were
made known to them, and were assented to and acquiesced in,
they are binding upon them, whether the acts did, or did not
conform strictly to the letter of attorney previously given by
them to West. This opinion of the court is deemed a sufficient answer to all the prayers made by counsel for plaintiff
and defendants."
To this opinion of the court on the said prayers, and the
refusal of the court to sustain the objections so made by the
defendants' counsel, exceptions were taken.
The defendants, by their counsel, objected to the admissibility in evidence of the record from the parish court, in and
for the parish and city of New Orleans, in the state of Louisianna, annexed to the commission, for any-purpose, on the
ground of its not being authenticated according to law, but
the court overruled this objection. The defendants' counsel
.excepted.
And the defendants further prayed the direction of the court
'to the jury, that if they should be of opinion, from the evidence, that the defendants did ratify the said sale of said ne-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

groes, yet if they should be of opinion that West did not, before
such ratification, apprise the defendants of the fact that letters
of administration were never taken out by him in Louisiana,
upon the estate of Mrs Van Pradelles, and of the fact
that, by the laws of Louisiana, the executrixes, the defendants,
never could have claimed any property in the said negroes so
sold, and that the defendants, in ignorance of the existence of
these facts, did ratify said sale then, such ratification being
made without a full knowledge of all circumstances material
for them to know before they made such ratification, is not
binding upon them. The court said'
"This prayer not arising from the facts of the case, the
court refuse to grant it. But the court are of opinion, that if
the jury should believe from the evidence, that the proceedings
of their attorney were ratified by them, it is not material whether
they knew or did not know thatWest had not taken out letters
of administration on the estate of the testatrix."
To which opinion, and to the refusal of the court to grant
said prayer, the defendants, by their counsel, excepted.
The defendants prosecuted this writ of error.
The case was argued by Mr Johnson, for the plaintiffs in
error, and by Mr Williams, for the defendant.
Mr Johnson contended, that the circuit court erred
1. In overruling the objections made by the defendants below to the written evidence offered by the plaintiff.
2. In refusing the instructions asked by the defendants'
counsel.
3. In giving the instructions which were given to the jury.
After a particular reference to the matters contained in
the record of the proceedings of the court of Louisiana, Mr
Johnson insisted, that the contents thereof could not be
evidence in this case. The defendants below were not parties to it, they had no notice from the plaintiff that the
proceeding was instituted, and that they would be affected
by the result. If they knew of the suit. it was not by such
a knowledge of it that they became parties to it, or could be
bound by it. Nor does it appear that a notice of the suit,
and of claims upon the attorney of the defendant m the suit

SUPREME COURT.
[Owings v. Hull.]

by Mr Hull, was given to him, with a view to the ultimate
responsibility of his constituents. Although such a notice would
not have had any legal effect, yet its absence makes the claim
to introduce the record in the circuit court, still less entitled to
consideration, and entirely denuded. West was the special
agent of the plaintiffs in error, his powers were created, and
their purposes declared in the letter of attorney which was sent
to him. That power was filed in the office of the clerk of the
probate court of New Orleans, and could, and ought to have
been seen by Mr Hull. As it gave no authority from the
executrixes to proceed, but under and in conformity with the
laws of Louisiana, in reference to the estate of the testatrix,
so it gave no power to him to appear for them in actions for a
neglect or breach of those laws by him, or to bind them by a
mis-execution of the power, or to answer the consequences of
such abuse of it.
The acts of West were then, so far as they could affect the
plaintiffs, as those of an entire stranger to them, and the record
of the proceedings which was admitted in the circuit court, had
no other principle of law to sustain its admission, than would
support a claim to the introduction, as evidence, of the record of
the proceedings in a suit between any other parties, and in any
other court or country
As a judgment of the parish court, and of the supreme court,
by which Mr Hull was deprived of the tlavesobe obtained from
West, the record might have been admitted in evidence, but
nothing more. NoL a portion of the other parts of it were
legally in the case. The testimony taken in one trial between
parties, is not evidence in a succeeding trial between the same
parties, much less is it evidence between other parties. It is
res inter alios acta.
The authentication of the act of sale, accompanied with the
testimony of the clerk of the court of probates, was not sufficient. The original should have been produced, or it should
have been proved that it could not be produced, and must remain with the notary, upon some rule or principle proved to
the court. Nor could it be evidence if the original had been
offered. It was an act done by West, out of, and unauthorised
by the power of attorney which he held. It was not an act
within the scope of his authority, but was a plain violation of it.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

Nor can the introduction of this evidence be sustained on
the ground, that the acts of West were adopted by the plaintiffs m error. Before this could be, it should have been shown,
and it was not shown, that they had full knowledge of all
those acts, and of every circumstance connected with them.
If it had been proved that the plaintiff in error knew that in
the execution of the power under which West acted, he had
violated instead of conforming to the laws of Louisiana, that
the act of sale was not such as was permitted by those laws,
and that in reference to slaves so situated, a sale could only
be made by auction, and with this, and a full knowledge of
every other fact, they had ratified and adopted all that had
been done the case might have stood differently.
The ruling of the court that the defendants in the circuit
court were bound by the acts of West, was contrary to established principles of law. They did not know them, they received no part of the money produced by them, they were done
without authority Cited, 5 Johns. 58, 59, Cro. J. 468, 1

Ir Williams, for the defendant.
Had West authority to sell the slaves, part of the estate
of Mrs Van Pradelles I This authority is shown by the letter of attorney-by the correspondence of Mr Winchesterby his accounts furnished to the executrixes, his constituents
all of which testimony is independent of the record of the proceeding In the couris in New Orleans. That he sold the slaves
is also proved by evidence out of that record, by his correspondence, by the act before the notary, by his accounts,
and by the correspondence of Mr Winchester with Morgan,
Dorsey and Company
Has there been a recovery of the slaves from Mr Hull by
parties having a title superior to the vendors I This is established by the record from New Orleans.
The parish court appears to put the right of recovery upon
the ground that, as Mrs Van Pradelles was presumed to be
alive, and her children were entitled to be in provisional possession of her property, the slaves could not be rightfully sold.
The supreme court, while they seem to imply that no valid
voL. ix.-4 c

SUPREME COURT
[OwIngs v. Hull.]

sale could be made of the property, appear to place the right
to recover it on the ground, " that the sale was made without
an order of court, and not by public auction."
This, however, is manifest, that neither the defendants, nor
their agent, did convey a valid title to the property to Mr Hull,
either, because a good one could not be made by them, or,
because the agent did not accompany his sale with the proper
formalities. So that the vendors, or their agent, have received
the vendee's money without a valuable consideration in exchange.
A vendor is always held in sales of personal property, impliedly to warrant the title. 2 Kent's Comm. 478, and the
authorities there cited, Flotte v Aubert, 2 Orleans T. Rep.
329, 2 B1. Com. 451, 3 Ib.166. Here the act of sale before the notary public contains an express warranty of title.
To the objections urged by the defendants to the evidence
offered by the plaintiff, it is answered1. The record from ]New Orleans is only relied on to establish
a recovery of the slaves from the vendee, for defect of title in
him, and consequently in those from whom he purchased.
2. The original act of sale is shown to be a part of the records
of a public officer-a sworn copy is, therefore, the best evidence, which can be afforded or required.

3.

This court will take notice, officially, that notaries public in
Louisiana, not a foreign country, are public officers without further evidence. P Wash. C. C. Rep. 449. 4. The depositions
and documentary proofs included in the record, are not insisted on as evidence for the plaintiff, nor are they requisite for
him in order to maintain this action. 5. The letters testamentary, or authority granted to West, are proved by Blache's
testimony This proof, however, is not essential for the plaintiff's case, as his authority is otherwise sufficiently established.
6. Mr Winchester's letters are most clearly competent and
legal evidence. He proves his appointment as agent and
attorney of the defendants, and his authority to write the
letters referred to. Of course his acknowledgement of the
receipt of West's accounts affects them with his knowledge
and acts.
As to the first exception of the defendant in the circuit court.
1. To the assumption on the part of the defendants, that

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

there is no evidence to show that West had any authority to
make sales of the property of their testatrix, except in conformity with the laws of Louisiana, are opposed the instructions of their counsel, Mr Winchester, in his letter to West of
the 13th of November 1816, wherein, after giving specific,
directions to sell the several descriptions of property, and especially that the negroes were to be sold on a credit of three and
six months, he adds "but it is tile wish of the Misses Owings
that you should consider yourself at liberty to exercise your own
discretion as you may think best, under existing circumstances;
and, whenever you may think it most conducive to the interest
of those concerned, to deviate from the above instructions."
And in Mr Winchester's letter to West of the 14th of July
1817, wherein he acknowledges the receipt of the copies of
the correspondence between West and Hull, relative to the
sale of the slaves in question, he adds "the executrixes are
satisfied with all you have done towards a settlement of the
estate, and relying confidently on your friendly exertions in
their behalf, have only to add, generally, that whatever, under
existing circumstances, may seem best in your judgment to be
done with the estate, either real or personal, or with any part
of it, they will approve and sanction." In these letters, it will
be perceived, there is no reference to the laws of Louisiana, as
furnishing guides to regulate the sales by West.
2. It is manifest by the act of sale, that West supposed
himself to be acting within the terms of, and according to his
instructions, as contained in the letter of attorney to him of
the 30th of January 1816. And it is no fault on the part of
the plaintiff, if West did not conform himself to his instructions.
He was the agent of the defendants, and not of the plaintiff.
But whether he did, or did not so conform himself, in the sale
of the slaves, every thing which he did do in regard to that
sale, was known and acquiesced in, and ratified by the defendants. Such knowledge and ratification are proved by Mr
Winchester's letters and testimony.
As to the second exception.
Neither in the court below, nor in the points filed by the
plaintiffs in error, is the defect in the authentication of the record pointed out. It will be observed that it does not purport

for the parish and city of New Orleans. And all the legal
formalities, required by the act of the 26th of May 1790, appear to be complied with.
Moreover the transcript of the record offered in evidence by
the plaintiff is a part of the testimony taken under the first
commission, and it is proved by the witnesses, examined
under that commission, to be a true copy of those legal proceedings. 2 Cranch 238.
The third exception of the defendants below
There are no facts in the case whereon to found this exception.
1. It would seem that the proper authority was taken out
by West to enable him to act as the attorney of the defendants.
2. The want of title in the defendants in the property, which
they authorized and directed West to sell, was a matter of
law, which they were bound to know, and not a question of
fact. 3. It does not appear, from the evidence, that the
defendants were ignorant of any circumstances material for
them to know, in this transaction. 4. If the attorney and
agent of the defendants had been guilty of any fraud or
neglect towards them, but in which the plaintiff had no participation, they must suffer the consequences, and not an innocent third party 5. The ignorance of a vendor, that his title
to personal property sold by him is defective-affords no defence
against the vendee's action upon an implied, or upon express
warranty of title. 6. The consequences are the same to a
vendee, whether the vendor knew, or did not know of his defect of title. The former has parted with his money without
any equivalent, and the vendor's ignorance in this respect
cannot entitle him to retain money without consideration.
On the points submitted by the plaintiffs in error, Mr Williams argued
That the record from New Orleans was legal and competent
evidence to prove the recovery of the slaves by a paramount
title. The record is relied on for this purpose only, and, if
such judicial recovery is not the only legal evidence to establish such a fact, it is clearly the most proper and conclusive
evidence.
To the demand for a restoration of the slaves, the purchaser
drives the party claiming to a suit and the defendants have

[Owings v. Hull.]

notice of its pendency, their agent and attorney at New Orleans is a witness in the cause, it is decided against the purchaser, lie prosecutes an appeal to the supreme court, and
the restoration is only submitted to under the mandate of tribunals whose commands were irresistible.
Authories can scarcely be required to justify such conduct,
and to maintain the right to recover under such circumstances.

The circuit court substantially adopt the views of the plaintiff's counsel, and every part of their opinion is believed to be
impregnable.
Mr Johnson, in reply The ruling of the circuit court was,
that the record of the parish court was evidence, and therefore the counsel for the plaintiff below used the whole contents
of the record before the jury. The court refused to discriminate, and to decide on those parts of the proceedings in the court
of Louisiana, and the documents produced in that court, which
were or were not legal testimony. This was the error then
and now complained of. Some of the matters in the record,
and part of the correspondence are not proved, nor was it
shown that any attempt had been made to prove them.
It was the duty of -the plaintiff below, to have proved the
want of title, derived under the act of sale, independent of the
record. He came into the circuit court to maintain his claim
against the executrixes of Mrs Van Pradelles, for money had
and received to his use, for money paid under a consideration
which had failed. He could only maintain such a claim by
legal proof, shown to be such by the rules of evidence, and not
made such proof by the judgment of a distant tribunal, in a
suit to which they were not' parties.
Was the sale made by West binding on his supposed principals I It was not within the prescribed and declared principies on which he was to act under the power of attorney No
money was received by them. There was no proof that any
money was received but by the letter of West, and that letter was inadmissible in evidence, in the form in which it was
presented to the court. The whole sum paid by Mr Hull
to West, if any was legally proved to have been paid, was
by him retained. The last instalment, if paid to Mrs Donaldson, was retained by her, and if that sum was to be recovered back, it should have been sought in an action against
her. She was one of the parties to the proceeding in the
parish court to vacate the sale of the slaves, as pretended
to have been made by West. She, with the co-heirs of

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owrogs v. Hull.]

Mrs Van Pradelles, recovered the slaves for which, in part, the
nmoney paid by Mr Hull. was received by her and on every
principle, if any one was liable, she was liable to refund it.
And yet in the circuit court a judgment was given for this
amount, included in the instalments paid to, and retained by
West, against the plaintiffs in error I
The defendant in error, as was submitted to the court in the
argument in chief, was bound to know the extent and nature
of the powers of West, 1 Peters 264, 290, and whether the act
of sale was in conformity to those powers and to the law's of
Louisiana.
Those laws are, that executors cannot sell at private sale, and
must sell by auction, and the judgment of the parish court
was founded solely on the defect of the sale. It was, therefore, a loss sustained by his want of vigilance, by his inattention
to his own obligations to protect himself from such a proceeding,
from a loss not brought upon him by the acts of the plaintiffs-in
error, or by acts authorised by their agent, a loss they could not
protect him from, but from which he could have protected
himself. Suppose the letter of attorney to West had, in express terms, directed the agent to apply to the court for an
order to sell the slaves, and he had sold them without such an
order; it would not have been contended, that the constituents
in the power were bound by such a sale. The power of attorney
in this case, is the same in effect. It contemplates the intended
proceedings under it, to be in conformity with the laws of Louisiana. The acts of an agent beyond his authority, do not bind
his principal. 7 Johns. Rep. 391.
As to the position, that the ratification of the acts of West
bound the plaintiffs although they were ignorant of their nature
and invalidity, this has been already met by the argument
before offered to the court. The plaintiffs in error did not
know the law of Louisiana, nor had they an opportunity to
know it.
The defendant in error claims that the act of sale, which is
proved by a notarial copy taken from the notarial register, is
evidence because such is the law of Louisiana as to copies of
that kind. This may be the law there, but it is not known to
be the law by this court, and the party availing himself of the
law should prove it to be such. The circuit court of the United

SUPREME COURT
[Owings v. Hull.]

States are not bound to know the laws of the several states,
and if they are called on to administer them in a case where
they apply, the laws should be proved. This was not done.
Mr Justice STORY, after stating the facts, delivered the opinmon of the Court.
The original suit was brought to recover back the purchase
money paid by the defendant in error for the slaves, and
other compensation for the defect of title [as mentioned in the
previous statement of the facts of the case]. The jury found a
verdict for the original plaintiff, for 2636 dollars and 96 cents,
upon which judgment was rendered accordingly, and the present writ of error is brought to revise that judgment upon certain bills of exceptions taken at the trial, on behalf of the
,plaintiffs in error.
The objections taken to the admissibility of the evidence
were, in the first place, that the 'ecord in the case of the Heirs
of the testatrix v Hull, in Louisiana, was not evidence against
the defendants in the present suit, except as to the judgment
of the court in Louisiana. By the judgment, we are to understand, not that part of the record, which in a suit at the
common law technically follows, the ideo consideratum est,
&c., for that would be wholly unintelligible, without reference to the preceding pleadings and proceedings, but that
which, in common, as well as legal language, is deemed the exemplification of a judgment, that is to say, all the pleadings and
proceedings on which the judgment is founded, and to wich, as
matter of record, it necessarily refers. We are of opinion, that
this objection was well taken. The suit was res inter alios acta,
and the proceedings, and judgment therein were no further
evidence than to show a recovery against Hull, by a paramount title. There was error, therefore, in the circuit court,
in refusing to sustain this objection.
The next objection was, that the copy of the original bill of
sale of the slaves to Hull, on record in the notary's office, was
not evidence, unless the plaintiff accounts for the non produc
tion of the original. The validity of this objection depends
upon this consideration, whether the non production of the
original was sufficiently accounted for. It was not accounted
for by any proofs offered on behalf of the plaintiff, and unless

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

the circuit court could judicially take notice of the laws of Louisiana, there was nothing before the court to enable it to say
that the non production of the original was accounted for.
We are of opinion, that the circuit court was bound to take
judicial notice of the laws of Louisiana. The circuit courts
of the nited States are created by congress, not for the purpose of administering the local law of a single state alone, but
to administer the laws of all the states in the union, in cases to
which they respectively apply The judicial power conferred
on the general government, by the constitution, extends to
many cases arising under the laws of the different states. And
this court is called upon, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, constantly to take notice of and administer the jurisprudence of all the states. That jurisprudence is then, in no
just sense, a foreign jurisprudence, to be proved, in the courts of
the United States, by the ordinary modes of proof by which the
laws of a foreign country are to be established, but it is to be
judicially taken notice of in the same manner, as the laws of
the United States are taken notice of by these courts.
Under these circumstances, we are at liberty to examine
the objection above stated, with reference to the known
laws of Louisiana. Now, in Louisiana, as indeed, in all
countries using the civil law, notaries are officers of high
Importance and confidence, and the contracts and other acts
of parties executed before them and recorded by them, are
of high credit and authenticity. Some contracts and conveyances are not valid, except they are executed in a prescribed manner, before a notary, others again, if executed
by the parties elsewhere, may be recorded by a notary, and a
copy of such record is in many cases evidence. Where a contract or other act is executed in a particular manner, before a
notary, the protocol or original remains in his possession apud
acta, and the act is deemed, what is technically called, an
"authentic act ;" and a copy of such act, certified as a true
copy by the notary, who is the depository of the original, or
his successor, is deemed proof of what is contained in the original, for the plain reason that the original is properly in the
custody of a public officer, and not deliverable to the parties.
This will abundantly appear, by a reference to the Civil Code
of Louisiana, from article 2231 to article 2250. Now, the bill
VOL. ix.-4 D

SUPREME COURT.
[Owings v. Hull.]

of sale in the present case, is precisely in that predicament.
It was executed before a notary in the manner prescribed by
the laws of Louisiana, the original is in his possession, and is
an authentic act, apud acta and therefore, the party is 4ot entitled to the possession of it, but only to a copy of it. So that
the absence of the original is sufficiently accounted for, and
the copy being duly proved, was properly admissible in evidence. There was no error, therefore, in the circuit court, in
admitting this evidence.
And this constitutes an answer to the next objection viz.
"that to make the act of sale evidence, it must appear, by the
laws of Louisiana, properly and legally proved, that the original
act of sale, of which it purports to be a copy, is in the custody
of a public depository, and cannot be adduced in evidence."
By the laws of Louisiana, as already stated, the original is in
the hands of such a depository, and, therefore, the objection
falls to the ground.
The next objection is, that the documents, and documentary
proofs contained in the record of the Louisiana suit, above mentioned, are not evidence against the defendants. This has been
already disposed of under the first objection, and there was
error in the circuit court in not sustaining the objection.
The next objection is, that the papers referred to in the testimony of Martin Blache, purporting to be letters testamentary,
granted by the court of probates of Louisiana to John K. West,
are not legal evidence in the cause against the defendants.
We are of opinion that the objection is unfounded, and was
rightly overruled by the circuit court. Blache swears that he
is the clerk and register of the court of probates; that the copy
is a true copy of the original, that he cannot send the original,
which is on file in the court of probates. Under such circumstances, the copy is the best evidence which the nature of the
case admits of.
The next objection is, that the evidence of Mr Winchester,
with regard to the letters and the accounts of J. K. West,
transmitted by him, is not admissible evidence in the cause.
In our opinion the circuit court was right in overruling this objection. Mr Winchester was the attorney in fact of the defendants, and conducted, in their behalf, the correspondence
with J. K. West, and the letters which passed between them

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.]

must be presumed to have been brought fully to the knowledge
of the defendants, and were important to establish a presumption of the ratification of the acts of West by the defendants,
after the communication of them. How far they ought to avail
for that purpose, was matter of fact for the consideration of the
jury. The only question with which we have to do, is their
competency for this purpose.
The next and last objection, under this head, which properly should have preceded all the others, but was taken in a
subsequent stage of the trial, is to the admissibility in evidence
of the record from the parish court of the city of New Orleans,
already referred to, for any purpose, on the ground of its not
being authenticated according to law. This objection was
overruled by the circuit court, and, in our opinion, properly
overruled. The record is authenticated in the precise manner
required by the act of congress, of the 26th May 1790, having
the attestation of the clerk, and the seal of the court annexed,
together with a certificate of the sole judge of the court that
the attestation is in due form of law
We may now proceed to the consideration of the instructions
asked of the court in behalf of the defendants, in the farther
progress of the cause, and refused by the court. With those
asked by the plaintiff, in the actual posture of the cause, upon
the present writ of error, we have nothing to do.
The first instruction asked was, that there was no evidence
in the cause to show that John K. West had any authority from
the defendants in the cause, to effect a sale of any property
belonging to the estate of their testatrix, in Louisiana, except
in conformity with the laws of the said state, and that unless
the plaintiff shows a sale to the plaintiff (Hull), by West, in
conformity with the said laws, and a subsequent recovery from
Hull, he is not entitled to recover. We are of opinion that
this instruction ought to have been given as prayed.
Every authority given to an agent or attorney, to transactbusiness for his principal, must, in the absence of any counter proofs,
be construed to be, to transact it according to the laws of the
place where it is to be done. A sale of slaves, authorised by
an executrix, to be made in Louisiana, must be presumed to
be intended to be made in the manner required by the laws of
that state to give it validity And the purchaser, equally with

SUPREME COURT
[Owings v. Hull.]

the seller, is bound under such circumstances to know what
these laws are, and to be governed thereby
The law will
never presume that parties intend to violate its precepts and
indeed, the very terms of the letter of attorney under which the
present sale was made, clearly point out that it was in contemplation of the parties that judicial, as well as extrajudicial acts
might be required to be done. The attorney is to execute good
and sufficient deeds, &c., for the purpose of transferring all the
right and title of the heirs of the testatrix in her real and personal estate, to the purchasers, and generally to do, negotiate
and perform all other acts, matters and things in the premises, for the effectual settlement of the estate, &c. Now, there
could be no effectual settlement unless a valid title to the
slaves and other property sold, was given, according to the
laws of Louisiana , and there is no evidence in the case to
show that the defendants ever contemplated any sale, which
should not be valid by those laws. The circuit court therefore
erred in not giving the instruction.
The next instruction asked, was for the court to instruct the
jury that, unless they believed that John K. West strictly complied with the special instructions given him by the defendants
in the power of attorney of January 1816, and caused such
legal proceedings to be instituted, as were necessary to effect
a sale of the personal estate, in Louisiana, 6f which their testatrix died possessed, and under such legal proceedings, made
a sale of the slaves, being part of the personal estate, to the
plaintiff (Hull), and that the slaves were subsequently recovered from the plaintiff, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.
For the reasons already given,this instruction oughtalso to have
been given. This is not the case of a general agency, but a
special agency, created by persons acting in autre droit. The
purchaser was therefore bound to see whether the agent acted
within the scope of his powers, and, at all events, he was
bound to know that the agent could not, in virtue of any general power, do any act which was not in conformity with the
laws of Louisiana. The principals could never be presumed to
authorise him to violate those laws, and the purchaser purchasing a title invalid by those laws, must have purchased it
with his eyes open.
The next instruction asked, was for the court to direct the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Owings v. Hull.)

jury, that if they should be of opinion, from the evidence, that
the defendants did ratify the said sale of the slaves, yet if they
should be opinion that West did not, before such ratification,
apprise the defendants of the fact that the letters of administration were never taken out by him in Louisiana upon the
estate of the testatrix, and of the fact that by the laws of Louisiana, the executrixes, the defendants, never could have
claimed any property in the slaves so sold, and that the defendants, in ignorance of the existence of these facts, did ratify the
said sale then such ratification, being made without a full
knowledge of all circumstances material for them to know before they made such ratification, is not binding upon them.
The court refused to give this instruction, because the prayer
did not arise from the facts of the case. But the court did
direct the lury, that if the jury should believe, from the evidence, that the proceedings of their attorney were ratified by
them, it was not material whether they did or did not know,
that West had taken out letters of administration on the estate
of the testatrix.
It is wholly unnecessary for us now to consider whether the
instruction as prayed, ought to have been given or not , for
we are of opinion, that the instruction actually given cannot,
in point of law, be supporied. No doctrine is better settled, both
upon principle and authority, than this, that the ratification
of an act of an agent previouslr unauthorized, must, in order
to bind the principal, be with a full knowledge of all the material facts. If the material facts be either suppressed or unknown, the ratification is treated as invalid, because founded
in mistake or fraud. Now, by the laws of Louisiana (Civil
Code, art. 1681, 1682), testaments made in foreign countries,
and other states of the union, cannot be carried into effect on
property in that state, without being registered in the court
within the jurisdiction of which the property is situated , and
the execution thereof is ordered by the judge, which may be
done, if it be established that the testament has been duly
proved before a competent judge of the place where it was received. So that there is no doubt, that the due probate of the
will of the testatrix, before the proper court of probate of Louisiana, was an indispensable preliminary to any sale of the
property in that state. If West had not taken out letters of

SUPREME COURT.
[Owmga v. Hull.)

administration on the estate of the testatrix, in Louisiana, it is
clear that' he could have no authority to sell the slaves, or to
bind the executrixes.
For these reasons we are of opinion, that the judgment of
the circuit court ought to be reversed, and the cause be remanded to the circuit court, with directions to award a venire
facias de novo.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district
of Maryland, and was argued by counsel, on consideration
whereof, it is the opinion of the court, that there was error in
the said circuit court in refusing to sustain the objections made
by the original defendants (now plaintiffs in error), contained
in their first specification in the record, viz. "That the record
in the case of Donaldson v. Hull, in the parish court of New
Orleans, is not evidence in this cause against the defendants,
except as to the judgment of the court in Louisiana." And
also in their fourth specification, viz. "That the depositions
and documentary proof contained in the record, in the cause
of Donaldson v. Hull, are not evidence against the defendants
in this cause." And also that there was error in the said circuit court in refusing to grant the first instruction prayed by
the defendants, viz. "To direct the jury that there is no evidence in the cause to show that John K. West had any authority from the defendants in this cause, to effect a sale of
any property belonging to the estate of their testatrix, in Louisiana, except in conformity with the laws of said state, and
that unless the plaintiff shows a sale to the plaintiff Hull, by
West, in conformity with said laws, and a subsequent recovery
from Hull, he is not entitled to recover." And also in refusing
the second instruction prayed by the defendants, viz. "To
direct the jury that, unless they believe that John K. West
strictly complied with the special instructions given him by the
defendants in the power of attorney of January 30th 1816, and
caused such legal proceedings to be instituted as were necessary to effect a sale of the personal estate of which their testatrix died possessed of in Louisiana, and, under such legal
proceedings, made sale of certain slaves, being part of the said

JANUARY TERM 1835.

631

[Owings v. Hull.]

personal estate, to J. F Hull, the plaintiff in this cause, and
that the said slaves were subsequently recovered from the said
Hull that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover." And also in
giving the following instruction to the jury, viz. "That if the
jury should believe from theevidence, thattheproceedings of their
attorney were ratified by them, it is not material whether they
knew, or did not know, that West had not taken out letters of
administration on the estate of the testatrix." It is therefore
considered by the court, that for these errors the judgment of
the said circuit court be, and the same is hereby reversed and
annulled, and the cause is remanded to the said circuit court,
with directions to award a venire facias de novo.
