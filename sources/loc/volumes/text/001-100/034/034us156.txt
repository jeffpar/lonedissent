SUPREME COURT

SEBASTIAN I-IRIART,

PLAINTIFF IN ERROR V. JEAN GASSIES

BALLON.
Louisiana. The district court of the United States for the eastern district of
Louisiana, in conformity with the provisions of the act of congress of the
26th of May 1824, adopted, as a rule of practice in that court, the regulations
established by a law of Louisiana, by which, on appeal bonds, when the appellants failed in their appeal, on the coming in of the decree or judgment
of the appellate court, a summary judgment on motion should be entered
against principal and securities in the appeal bonds.
Under this rule, after the aflirmance of a decree of the district court by the
supreme court of the United States, and the filing of the mandate of the
supreme court; the district court, on a motion for a rule on the security in
an appeal bond to show cause why judgment should not be entered against
him on the/first day of the next term, and no cause being shown, entered
a judgment against the security.
The party against whom the judgment was entered, afterwards came into
court, and prayed a trial by jury, which was refused, and he prosecuted
this writ of error to reverse the judgment of the district court refusing the
said trial.
By the Court. The rule of the district court of Louisiana follows the analogy
of the laws of Louisiana, being modified only so far as is proper to suit the
organization of the courts of the United States, and to conform to the laws
thereof. The summary judgment is therefore strictly authorized, and the
party had noright to atrial byjury. In becoming a security he submitted himself tobe governed by the fixed rules which regulate the practice of the court.
An appeal was taken in the same case to a decree of the district court dissolving an injunction. Although this appeal was not before the court, the
court said: the decree being only interlocutory, and not final, is not the
subject of an appeal.

IN error to the district court of the United States for the
eastern district of Louisiana. (a)
(a) The record, in this case, contains the " General Rules" for the government of the United States court in the eastern district of Louisiana, in civil
causes, or suits at law, as contradistinguished from admiralty and equity
causes and criminal prosecutions, made in pursuance of the seventeenth
section of the judiciary act of 1789, and of the first section of the act of congress of the 26th of May 1824, entitled " an act to regulate the mode of practice in the courts of the United States for the district of Louisiana."
It has been considered useful, by the Reporter, to insert these " General
Rules" in this volume.

defendant, by delivering the same to him personally, or by leaving it at his
usual place of abode, ten days before the day of return mentioned in the writ,
allowing one day in addition for every twenty miles the defendant may reside
from New Orleans. The writ or process shall run in the words which have

cent, from the 1st of December 1829, until paid, and costs of
suit, from which judgment an appeal was taken to this court

bond, the present appellant, in the penalty of 4500 dollars,
which appeal was beard in this court at January term 1832.
uncertain, the court shall proceed to hear testimony, assess the damages, and
render final judgment for the sum so assessed.
" Rule 4. The answer shall contain nothing impertinent or irrelevant; but
the defendant shall be required to plead all such matter of law and fact in the
same answer as he may think proper to rely on, conformably to the rules of
practice adopted by the first judicial court of the state of Louisiana, prior to
the adoption of the ' Code of Practice;' and in all cases where matters of law
and matters of fact are pleaded in the same answer, the pleas on points of law
submitted to the court, shall be argued and determined before the issues of
fact shall be submitted to the jury.

shall be entered in the following order. 1. Causes in which both issues to the
court and to the country are made up. 2. United States causes of a general
nature, and criminal prosecutions. 3. Jury causes, other than those of the
United States. 4. Court causes, or suits to be tried by the court alone. 5.

thus prescribed.
Ci Rule 6. All causes at issue, whether in point of law or fact, shall be called
on the second day of each term at the meeting of the court, and set down for
trial. In all cases in which pleas both to the court and country are made, the
pleas involving matters of law, or issues submitted to the court alone, shall be
first tried, and such of them as may be directed to be tried on the issues of
fact, shall be immediately transferred to the jury docket, to be tried on the
merits during the same term, in the discretion of the court. In all cases in
which dilatory or declinatory pleas or exceptions to form are made and overruled, the party making such plea or pleas, or exceptions, shall pay to the
plaintiff all costs of suits up to the time of their being decided against him,
and when a plea is made to the jurisdiction of the court, involving the question of citizenship of a party, it shall be tried by a jury, and if the verdict sustains the jurisdiction, all costs shall be paid to the plaintiff, and the cause
shall be immediately tried by the same jury on its merits, at the option of the
plaintiff, if by the pleading it be a jury cause, if not it shall be forthwith submitted to the court for decision.
" Rule 7. If it be the intention of a party to take an issue on the fact, he
must expressly pray for a jury, otherwise the cause shall be wholly tried by
the court, (except cases where the law itself requires a jury) and shall be put
in the fourth class of cases on the docket.
" Rule 8. When a jury is about to be sworn in a cause, each party may peremptorily set aside three of them, but no more, except for a legal cause.

6 Peters 761. A judgment confirming the judgment below
was rendered, and upon said judgment and mandate of this
court in due course of proceeding, an execution issued against

motion, or other satisfactory cause shall be shown to the court, on oath, to
prove it was not postponed on account of the plaintiff's neglect, or unless the
defendant, at such second calling, shall obtain a further continuance; but
nothing in this rule shall be construed to prejudice defendant's right of calling
for a non suit, at any previous court.
" Rule 11. If a cause is at issue, and either party move for a continuance
of it on account of the absence of a witness, such motion must be on oath or
affirmation of the party, his agent or attorney, in writing, subscribed by him,

court, (who shall be named and the place of his residence mentioned) is
wanting; that he believes that such witness is a material and competent witness in the cause, and, to satisfy the court of his materiality, shall state what
fact or facts it is expected or believed the witness will prove on the trial,
that all reasonable endeavours have been used to procure his attendance at
the term; that he cannot safely go to trial without the benefit of his testimony; and that a continuance is not prayed for the purpose of delay.

state what fact or facts it is believed will be proven on the trial of the cause,
that the testimony sought is competent and material, that he cannot safely go
to trial without the benefit of it, that he believes it can be procured in a certain time, which shall be specified, and that the application is not made for
delay. If a commission issue, interrogatories must be filed, as directed in the
following rule.
"Rule 12. The clerk is authorized, in vacation, on the written application
of the plaintiff or his attorney, to enter the discontinuance of a cause, and with
consent ofcounsel, written, signed, and put on file, to enter on the minutes, rules

not the intention of the party taking out the commission to take testimony de
bene esse under the thirtieth section of the judiciary act of 1789, he shall file
interrogatories and serve a copy thereof on the opposite party or counsel,
who may, if he thinks proper, add cross interrogatories, and return the whole
to the other within three days, or, in default thereof, the commission may be
executed without the cross interrogatories.
"Rule 13. No amendment shall be made to any petition or answer, unless

Gassies, for which sum a credit was given upon the execution the 31st of January 1833.
Upon the 13th of April 1833, a motion was made in the district court, that Sebastian Hiriart, the appellant, show cause
on the first day of next term, why judgment should not be

defence.

case and takes upon himself the burden of the proof, have the like privilege.

judgments pronounced in this court, a rule may be taken on the principal and

entered against him, for the amount of the judgment, damages,
interest and costs, and why execution should not issue against
him. At the proper time the said appellant filed his answer;
and after argument, &c., judgment was given against the appellant, upon said appeal bond, and the appellant prosecuted

SUPREME COURT.
[Hiriart v. Ballon.]

cIn the case under consideration, the rights of the party

complainant, as to his liability to pay this debt (for that was his
own stipulation in case the principal did not), were passed upon
at the time the judgment below was affirmed, and at all events,
when judgment was given against him on the rule to show
cause as above referred to, then perhaps he might have defeated the obligation by the plea 'non est factum' or some
other, but the dispute now is merely as to the remedy sought
to enforce a nght already determined by both courts.
"In the case of Young v. Grundy, 6 Cranch 51, it is said,
'an appeal does not lie from an interlocutory decree dissolving
an injunction.'
And in Gibbons v Ogden, 6 Wheaton
448, the court say, 'nor from a decree affirming a decretal
order of an inferior court refusing to dissolve an injunction.'
"I am aware that the technical expression, 'interlocutory
judgment,' is usually applied to incidental orders, made in the
progress of a 6ause, not affecting the main question to be afterwards determined by the court, but all incidental orders are
'interlocutory,' whether they be made pending or after the
determination of the main question, and these orders may be
made so long as the case is within the control of the court,
and all cases are within the control of the court until its judgment is fully executed. When an injunction is obtained suspending an execution, the object is not to bring the judgment
itself into review, but to inquire whether an improper attempt
is made to enforce it.
"Injunctions are grantable at chambers. Now it will not be
pretended that a verbal refusal of a judge to grant an injunction would sustain an appeal, but if he should, through inadvertence, grant it, when no equity appeared on the face of the
petition, or on further examination it should be found to be unfounded, and he should then refuse to perpetuate it, what difference is there in reason,. why a refusal to make it operative,
after a full investigation of its merits, should give the party any
more right to appeal, than his refusal in the first instancel
"It may be said that when a dispute arises as to the right of
a party to appeal, the case ought to be sent up to the appellate
court for its determination as to that right. To this there are
two answers 1. Where the law itself has fixed the amount
from which an appeal can be taken, and that amount is palpa-

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[Hiriart v. Balion.]

bly below the sum so fixed, or when the appellate court has
given a construction to the law embracing the right of a party
to appeal, in a given case, as I conceive has been done in cases
similar to this, it would be treating the court with disrespect
to send to it a case, of which, according to settled law, it could
not take cognizance. "2. However much I am disposed to
have my decisions reviewed, yet I am as much bound to guard
the rights of one party, as the other, and when my judgment
is convinced that the law does not authorise an appeal, and
which if granted would operate injuriously to the other party,
I feel bound to refuse it. Besides if this party has a right to
appeal upon the ground stated, his security in the appeal bond,
in case of his insolvency, would have the same right, on making a sufficient oath, to obtain an injunction, and so on ad
infinitum."1
After the order to dissoive the injunction, the plaintiff below
took out an alias execution against the property of Sebastian
Hiriart, the prior execution having been returned into court.
On the 12th of April 1834, Mr Slidell, counsel for Hiriart,
obtained, on motion, an order that the defendant, Jean Gassies
Ballon, show cause, on Monday, the 14th instant, at 11 o'clock,
A. M., why the execution issued in this case should not be
quashed, and all further proceedings on the judgment, rendered
in this case, suspended on the ground that the supreme court
has accorded a writ of error which had been refused by this
court before the execution issued.
And on the 14th of the same month, the following order
was made. The rule taken by the plaintiff on the defendant
came on this day before the court, when, no opposition being
made by the counsel for the defendant, it is ordered that the
same be made absolute, on condition that the plaintiff enter
into bond, with good and sufficient sureties, to respond to the
judgment enjoined against by the plaintiff.
The questions submitted to the court, on the part of the defendant in error, are whether there be error in the proceedings
of the district court of Lousiana in the refusal of the writ of
error, and whether the judgment and decree of the said court,
ought not to be confirmed with damages; the present application being made for delay only.

SUPREME COURT.
[Hiriart v. Ballon.]

Mr Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a writ of error to the district court of the eastern district of Louisiana. The plaintiff in error was surety in an appeal
bond given upon a writ of error to a judgment of the district
court of Louisiana, rendered in 1830, in the suit of Jean Gassies
Ballon v. Pierre Gassies, which judgment was affirmed in the
supreme court of the United States in 1832. Upon the cause
coming back to the district court, upon the mandate of the
supreme court, execution issued against the judgment debtor,
Pierre Gassies, and was returned satisfied in part. Upon motion afterwards made, and due notice to Hiriart, a summary
judgment was entered against him upon the appeal bond, in
pursuance of a rule of the district court. The rule is in the following words "in all cases of affirmance of judgment, on
writs of error, from judgments pronounced in this court, a rule
may be taken on the principal, and his sureties in the appeal
bond, returnable ten days after recording the mandate of the
supreme court, to show- cause why execution should not issue
against them, and no cause being shown, judgnent shall be
entered against them and the principal, and execution issue
accordingly." Hiriart showed for cause, (among other things
not necessary to be stated, as they are not cognizable on a writ
of error) that the proceeding was irregular, and that if liable
on the bond, his liability must be established by an ordinary
action, before a competent tribunal. The district court, notwithstanding, entered the summary judgment, and the writ
of error is taken to this judgment.
The principal point relied on seems to be that the party was
entitled to a trial by jury, and that no such summary judgment is authorized by law Whether this objection is well
founded depends upon the act of congress of the 26th of May
1824, for the regulation of the practice of the district court
of Louisiana. That act declares, that the mode of proceeding
in civil causes in the courts of the United States in Louisiana,
shall be conformable to the laws directing the mode of practice in the district courts of the states, with a power in the
judge, to make rules to adapt such laws of procedure to the
organization of the courts of the United States. The laws of
Louisiana allow appeals from the district courts of the state,
to the supreme court, upon giving an appeal bond with securi-

[Hiriart v. Ballon.]

ty, and authorize a summary judgment upon such appeal
bond, upon mere motion in the court from whence the appeal
was taken, in execution of the judgment of the appellate
court. (a)
The rule of the district court of Louisiana, therefore, follows the analogy of the laws of Louisiana, being modified only so far as is proper to suit the organization of the
courts of the United States, and to conform to the laws thereof.
The summary judgment, therefore, was strictly authorized,
and the party appellant had no right to a trial by jury. In
becoming a security he submitted himself to be governed by
the fixed rules which regulate the practice of the court. The
judgment is affirmed with damages at the rate of six per cent,
and costs.
It may be added, to prevent misapprehension, that there is
also in the same record, an appeal taken to a decree of the district
court, dissolving an injunction to the judgment granted upon a
petition in the nature of a bill in equity. This appeal is not
before us and the decree being only interlocutory, and not a
final decree, it is not the subject of an appeal.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record fiom the district court of the United States, for the eastern district of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof, it is adjudged and ordered by this court,
that the judgment of the said district court in this cause be, and
the same is hereby affirmed with costs and damages at the rate
of six per centum per annum.
