SUPREME COURT.

MAYOR, ALDERMEN, AND INJIABITANTS OF THE CITY OF

NEW ORLEANS, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR V CHRISTOVAL G.

DE

ARMAS, AND MANUEL SIMON CUCULLU.

Louisiana. A lot of ground situated in the city of New Orleans, which was
occupied, under an incomplete title, for some time by permission of the
Spanish government, granted before the acquisition of Louisiana by the
United States, was confirmed to the claimants, under the laws of the United
States, and a patent was issued for the same on the 17th of February 1821.
The city of New Orleans claiming this lot as being part of a quay dedicated
to the use of the city, in the original plan of the town, and therefore not
grantable by the king of Spain, enlarged the Levee, in front of New Orleans, so as to include it. The patentees from the United States brought
a suit in the district court of the state of Louisiana for the lot, which pronounced judgment in their favour, and that judgment was affirmed by the
supreme court of the state. The judgment was removed to this court,
under the twenty-fifth section of the judicial act. A motion was made to
dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction. By the Court. The
merits of this controversy cannot be revised in this tribunal. The only
inquiry here is, whether the record shows that the constitution, or a treaty,
or a law of the United States has, been violated by the decision of that
court.
The twenty-fifth section of the judicial act is limited by the constitution, and
must be construed so as to be confined within these limits. Butto construe
this section so that a case can arise under the constitution or a treaty, only
when the right is created by the constitution or treaty, would defeat the
obvious purpose of the constitution, as well as the act of congress. The
language of both instruments extends the jurisdiction of this court to rights
protected by the constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, from
whatever source these rights may spring.
To sustain the jurisdiction of the court in this case, it must be shown that the
title set up by the city of New Orleans, is protected by the treaty ceding
Louisiana to the United States, or by some act of congress applicable to that
title.
The third article of the treaty of Louisiana stipulates for the admission of
Louisiana into the union, and it obviously contemplates two objects. one
that stated, and the other that, till that admission, the inhabitants of the
ceded territory shall be protected in the enjoyment of their liberty, property
and religion. Had any of these rights been violated while the stipulation
continued in force, the individual supposing himself to be injured, might
have brought his case into this court, under the twenty-fifth section of the
judicial act.
But this stipulation ceased to operate whQn Louisiana became a member of
the union, and its inhabitants were "admitted to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The
right to bring questions of title decided in a state court before this tribunal,

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]
is not classed among those immunities. The inhabitants of Louisiana enjoy
all the advantages of American citizens, in common with their brethren in
their sister states; when their titles are decided by the tribunals of the state.
The act of congress admitting Louisiana into the union, carries into execution the third article of the treaty of cession, and cannot be construed to
give appellate jurisdiction to the court over all questions of title between
the citizens of Louisiana.
The patent granted to the claimants of the land did not profess to destroy any
previous existing title; nor could it so operate. The patent was issued
under the act of May 1820, entitled 11an act supplementary to the several
acts for the adjustment of land titles in the state of Louisiana." That act
confirms the titles to which it applies, "1against any claim on the part of the
United States." The title of the city of New Orleans could not be affected
by this confirmation.
It is a principle applicable to every grant, that it cannot affect pre-existing
titles.
The case of the United States v. Arredondo, 6 Peters 733, cited.

IN error to the supreme court of Louisiana.
The defendants in error commenced a petitory action, by
filing a petition in the first district court, in and for the first
judicial district of the state of Louisiana, claiming to be the
owners of a lot of ground in the city of New Orleans, eighty
feet front, and close to the foot of the Old Levee, between St
Philip's and Maria streets, and stating that the lot had formerly been built upon, and had been possessed by a certain
Thomas Beltran, or Bertrand, with the knowledge, perission and authorization of the Spanish government, from March
1788 to 1803, and by his widow, who afterwards demolished
the buildings, and removed to another part of the city. The
widow, acting for herself and the minors, took all the legal
steps to have the title confirmed by the United States; and the
commissioners of the land office reported on the title, that "it,
would be more an act of justice than of generosity, if the government should confirm it." The- commissioners under the
act of congress of 11 th May 1820, entitled "an act supplementary to the several acts for the adjustment of land claims in
the state of Louisiana," confirmed the title against any claim
of the United States; and a patent for the same was granted
to the widow and heirs of Bertrand. After the death of the
widow, the petitioners became the owners of the property by
purchase from her heirs,-they being also the heirs of Bertrand.
VOL. IX.-2 D

SUPREME COURT.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

The petition proceeds to state, that prior to the cession of
Louisiana by France, the lot of ground belonged to the king
of France, and by the laws of Spain, which were introduced
into the colony of Louisiana after the said cession, the king of
Spain by'his officeis had the full right of disposing of the same.
By the retrocession of the colony to France by Spain, the
right to the lot of ground became vested in France, if it was
not the property of Bertrand, and the same right was not divested by any act done by the king of Spain, except in favour
of Bertrand. That, by the treaty of cession of Louisiana to
the United States by France, the United States clearly acquired every lot of ground, land, squares, (emplacemens terrains) buildings, fortifications, edifices therein, which were
not pivate property-, and that the grant made by the aforementioned letters patent, therefore, justly and lawfully vested the said widow of Bertrand with all the rights of ownership and possession, which all the ditferent governments, who
had possessed Louisiana, had or could have to the said lot of
ground.
The petition alleges that the corporation of New Orleans,
under the pretence that the lot claimed by the petitioners is
a part of certain quays marked on a plan of the city, have enlarged the Levee in front of the city so as to include the same,
and pretend that they have just title to this lot, and prays
process, &c., and that it may be adjudged and decreed, that
the petitioners are the only true and lawful owners and proprietors of the above described property, and that the said
mayor, aldermen and inhabitants, have no right whatever in,
to or upon the same.
The answer of the corporation of New Orleans denies that
there had been an absolute grant of the lot in question by the
Spanish government to Bertrand, but only a permission to build
a temporary cabin thereon, and asserts that the patent of the
United States cannot be a good title thereto. They insist that
it had been determined in 1812, or 1813,:in a suit brought by
the corporation against the widow and heirs of Bertrand, that
the latter had no title to the lot, and was compelled to take
down the buildings thereon. The answer proceeds as follows.
"And the said defendants further say, that even supposing,
which they do deny, that the Spanish government would have
at any time made an absolute grant of the said parcel of land

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of Now Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

to the said Beltran or Bertrand, the said grant should be null
and void, because the said parcel of land made a part of the
quays of this city, that is, one of those public things which
even the sovereign himself had no authority to dispose of to the
prejudice of the public, without a flagrant abuse of his powers.
"And these defendants further say, that at the time of the
foundation of the city of New Orleans, under the French government, said government left between the bank of the river
Mississippi and the first row of houses fronting said river, a
large space emptied and unoccupied, under the name of quays,
and intended to serve and to be reserved as such for the use of
the inhabitants of this city, as they exist in the several cities of
France, and in her colonies, and as it is proved by the ancient
plans of the city of New Orleans, which have been preserved
in the office of the marine charts, maps and plans, which existed at Versailles, in France."
After proceeding to take the evidence of witnesses, and on
the exhibition of their testimony with the documentary evidence of the parties, the district court, on the 12th of March
1832, gave a judgment in favour of the petitioners in the following terms.
"The plaintiffs allege that the widow Gonzales, fromwhom
they derive title, obtained a grant from the United States of
the lot in question, and that the defendants have extended the
Levee so as to embrace said lot, and conclude with the prayer,
that they may be decreed to be the lawful owners, and the defendants enjoined from disturbing them in the free enjoyment
of ther rights as owners of said lot. The defendants oppose
this claim upon several grounds, but the only one which can
be relied upon with any hope of success is, that the space between the front buildings of the city and the river was, at the
time the city was laid off, under the government of France,
intended to be kept open for public use, designated as a quay,
and which could not be the subject of a grant. If the facts,
as stated in the answer, were true, the conclusion drawn from
them would be undeniable. The sovereign could not cede
what had been already granted, unless there be retrocession or
forfeiture. The only evidence in support of the defendant's
claim is a fac simile of a plan Anade by Charlevoix, and by him

SUPREME'COURT.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

stated to be copied from a plan deposited in the marine office,
made by N. B. Ing. de la M. 1744, and on which is marked
on the space between the front of the city and the river, the
word ' quay ' Names do not change the nature of things, a
quay is an artificial work, and may belong to an individual as
well as a corporation, but to belong to either, it must not only
exist and have a defined extent, but must be shown to have
been granted. It is self-evident to every one who has seen this
space of ground, that it is not a quay. The defendants have
shown no other title which can be validly opposed to the grant
under which the plaintiffs claim, there is no material difference
between this and the case of Metzinger and the defendants
that was a grant under the king of Spain, this a grant under
the United States, who have succeeded to the same rights.
Had the defendants sheltered themselves under their charter,
and shown that the public safety required that the base of the
Levee should be extended to prevent inundation, or that it was
necessary for a public way, the case might have presented a
different aspect.
"It is ordered and decreed, that the defendants be enjoined
not to disturb the plaintiffs in the possession and free exercise
of their rights, in and to the lot mentioned and described in
their petition, and that the defendants pay costs."
From this decision the corporation of New Orleans appealed
to the supreme court of the state of Louisiana. In February
1833, the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the inferior
court, and the case was finally disposed of, by a judgment, in.
favour of the original petitioners, a rehearing having been refused, on the 27th of March, in the same year.
The mayor, aldermen and inhabitants prosecuted this writ
of error; and the following errors in the judgment of the supreme
court of Louisiana, were assigned by the plaintiffs in error, and
came up with the record.
'1The judgment of the supreme court of the eastern district
of the state of Louisiana, affirming the judgment of the court
of the first district of said state, is erroneous, and ought to be
reversed, and judgment ought to be rendered in favour of the
plaintiffs in error, with costsor the following reasons, and
such others as may appear on the record.

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

I. The spot of ground in controversy makes part of an open
space in front of the city of New Orleans called a quay, which
by the ancient plans of the city was constituted a quay, or
public place, and dedicated to public use as well by its designation on said plans, as by the sovereign authority, and by its
use and occupation for public purposes.
"2. The right of the former sovereigns of Louisiana over this
place was a matter of prerogative, varying according to the institutions of the different governments which have-held Louisiana, but always inseparable from the sovereignty
"3. The right of use of this place by the public is a vested
right, is a species of property in which the inhabitants of
Louisiana are protected under the third article of the treaty of
cession.
"4. By the treaty of cession, Louisiana was ceded in full
sovereignty to the United States.
"5. The United States held this sovereign power during the
time they held the sovereignty of Louisiana, but by the admission of Louisiana into the union, this branch of sovereignty
was vested in the state of Louisiana, and under the constitution could not exist in the United States.
"6. The power of regulating the use or of appropriating or
changing the destination of public places belongs to the sovereign power alone.
"7 Since the admission of Louisiana into the union on a
footing with the original states; the United States had no power
to interfere with the property or use of any public place in
Louisiana.
"8. The plaintiffs in error, who are, under the laws of Louisiana, the proper parties to vindicate the public rights, held
the place in controversy by permission of, and by the authority
of the state of Louisiana, as will appear by the charter of the
city of New Orleans and the laws of the state, and claimed the
undisturbed use thereof by virtue of the treaty of cession, and
under the act of congress, passed on the 8th of April 1812, for
the admission of Louisiana into the union, and the decision of
the supreme court of the eastern district of Louisiana is against
the title, rights, and privileges thus claimed by the plaintiffs in
error, and in this is contrary to the provisions of the treaty and
law of the United States, and ought therefore to be reversed."

SUPREME COURT.
(City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucuilu.]

Mr Clay and Mr Porter, for the defendants in error, moved
to dismiss the writ of error for want of jurisdiction.
The jurisdiction will be attempted to be sustained on the
allegation that the questions in the cause depend on the treaty
by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States. It was
understood that in some cases the court had permitted a cause
to be argued on ilie merits, before the question of jurisdiction
was decided, but this was when the whole of the matters in
the cause were so intermixed as not to permit the point of jurisdiction to be separately examined. Such is not the fact in
this case. The question of jurisdiction stood forth from the
merits.
If the jurisdiction can be supported, it will rest on the first,
second and third articles of the Louisiana treaty, and principally on the third article, which declares that Louisiana
shall be incorporated into the union, and in the meantime that
the inhabitants should be protected in their property The
execution of the provision of the treaty to incorporate Louisiana, as a state of the union, was looked to in thus securing
the property of the inhabitants. It was not necessary to provide for the rights of property afterwards. From the time of
the incorporation, property in the state was held under the
guarantee of the constitution of the United States, as the property of the citizens of other states is held. After the admission of Louisiana into the union, as a state, the treaty ceased
to operate. From that time the rights of property depend upon,
and are to be decided by the laws and by the courts of the state.
But if these are not the effects of the admission of Louisiana
into the federal family, this is not a case arising under the
treaty. The purpose of the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary law, under which the jurisdiction in this case is claimed
to exist, is to enable this court to carry the constitution, treaties and laws of the United States into execution. Owings v.
Norwood's Lessee, 5 Cranch 344, 2 Cond. Rep. 275. The
case must arise out of-spring out of, a treaty; be created by
the treaty, or the right claimed be given by the treaty, and
which requires the courts of the United States to give force to
the treaty.
The title of the defendants in error originated during the
existence of the right of the Spanish crown to Louisiana, and

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

was afterwards confirmed by patent from the United States.
The plaintiffs in error claim the lot in controversy as a part of
a quay which belonged to the inhabitants of New Orleans,
and so designated in a map, it having, as they allege, been
appropriated for public use before the cession of the territory
Thus both the parties claim under the Spanish crown, and
assert their rights as having existed prior to the treaty; and
neither claims under the treaty. The treaty has nothing
to do with the title of either; and in the state courts nothing
was said of it. The property was granted before the treaty, to
Bertrand, and is now in the grantees of his heirs, under the
Spanish grant or, at the time of the cession, it was vacant,
and has since been granted by a patent, and is held under that
patent.
Again. It is not a case arising under the treaty, in which
the decision has been against the treaty The decision is in
favour of the treaty Both the corporation of New Orleans,
and the defendants in error, were intended to be secured by the
treaty. The decision of the supreme court of Louisiana is in
favour of a right under the treaty, and under a patent granted
by a law of the United States. There is, thus, a perfect neutrality in the parties as to the treaty
It Is now contended, that the plaintiffs in error claim under
the act of congress of 1812, by which Louisiana was admitted
into the union, as a state. It has not been before asserted that
the city of New Orleans claimed under that law The question in the courts of Louisiana was, whether the king of Spain
had granted, and whether he had authority to grant, the lot in
controversy; it having been previously dedicated to public uses.
The city of New Orleans claimed under a dedication in 1788.
The act of 1812 did not interfere with or affect either of these
asserted rights. It did not authorize the state of Louisiana,
thus made a sovereign state, to interfere with the rights of the
city of New Orleans. The property never belonged to th,)
state of Louisiana. If, at the time of the admission of the state
into the union, this property passed to or belonged to the state,
the state might interfere in the question between the parties to
this case, which has not yet taken place. But if such right
existed, or does exist, it may yet be presented, as it could not
be affected by the decision in this case. Louisiana, as a state,

232

SUPREME COURT
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullut]

has no other right to come into this court, than have the other
states of the union.
Mr Webster against the motion.
It has not been the practice of the court to discuss questions
of jurisdiction, when so intimately blended with the facts and
merits of the case, as are these in the cause now before them.
If they find the question so connected, they postpone a decision
until the whole argument is heard, and this is desired by the
plaintiffs in error.
It early became a question, in what manner the questions
in a case, which had been before a state court, should be made
to appear, so that jurisdiction of them could be taken in this
court. It became afterwards settled, that if, in the whole proceeding, it was manifest that a party set up, under a law or
treaty, or the constitution, a right, and a decision was against
that right, this court could intervene and exercise its revising
power over the case. The only question in this case is, therefore, whether a right of this kind was claimed by either of the
parties now before the court.
The question of jurisdiction is identical with the main question between the parties. The claim of the plaintiffs below
was founded on a patent from the United States; and the state
court held it valid. Thus their whole title depends upon the
validity of the patent. The claims of the city of New Orleans
are under the treaty, by which the property of those claiming
under the governments which had held Louisiana, was assured
to them. The corporation of New Orleans claim under the
treaty, asserting that the property was dedicated to public uses
and belonged to the city of New Orleans. The principles on
which their right rests, were settled in this court, in the Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh cases. Lessee of Howell v. Barclay, 6
Peters 498, Lessee of White v The City of Cincinnati, 6
Peters 431.
If the property in dispute was in the inhabitants of New
Orleans at the time of the treaty, it was out of the power of
the United States to grant it to those under whom the defendants in error claim. The decision was against the treaty,
which secured the property to the plaintiffs in error; and in favour of a patent which was given in violation of the treaty
The question is, whether the act of 1812 operates in the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

case. The treaty is part of the title which was completed by
that act. The creation of Louisiana into a state, made this
state the guardian and trustee of all the property which had
before that event become vested in the inhabitants of that part
of the territory of Louisiana. The rights thus guarantied
by the creation of the state of Louisiana by the act of 1812,
have been disregarded by the supreme court in their decision
in favour of a patent issued after that act.
The assignment of errors shows that the protection of the
treaty was claimed by the plaintiffs in error in the state court,
and the opinion of judge Martin, one of the judges of the supreme court of Louisiana, is also evidence of this position.
The application of the act of 1812 to the case, was in that court
overruled, and the plaintiffs in error say, that in so doing, the
court misconstrued the act.
The plaintiffs in error contend that the lot in question was
appropriated land in 1788, and, by the act of 18l, it passed as
such into the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana, as the other
property of citizens or inhabitants of the state, and could not
afterwards be interfered with or granted by the United States.
The effect of the act of 1812 was to transfer the property to
the state for. the use of the inhabitants.
There are many rights which are in the state, which, if violated, may be brought before this court. Thus rivers and highways, if interfered with, are such rights. Could not Lomsiana,
in cases of this kind, come into this court, under the act of
1812q
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
The appellees claim title to a lot of ground in the city of
New Orleans, as purchasers from the heirs of Catharine Gonzales, the widow of Thomas Beltran, alias Bertrand, who had
been in possession of the lot for several years, by permission of
the Spanish government. This incomplete title was regularly
confirmed under the laws of the United States, and a patent
was issued for the premises to Catharine Gonzales, on the
17th of February 1821.
The city of New Orleans, claiming this lot as being part of
a quay, dedicated to the use of the city in the original plan of

the town, and therefore, not grantable by the king, has enlarged the Levee so as to embrace it. The appellees brought
their petLitory action in the district court of the state of Louisiana, praying to be confirmed in their rights to the said lot of
ground, and that the corporation might be enjoined from disturbing them in the exercise thereof.
The district court pronounced its judgment in favour of the
petitioners, which, on appeal, was affirmed by the supreme
court of the state. This judgment of affirmance has been
removed into this court, under the twenty-fifth section of the
judicial act.
The merits of the controversy cannot be revised in this tribunal. We can inquire only whether the record shows that
the constitution, or a treaty, or a law of the United States, has
been violated by the decision of the state court. The appellees move to dismiss the writ of error, because no such violation appears.
In support of his motion, the counsel has, we think, In his
argument, prescribed too narrow a principle for the acuon of
this court. He says, very truly, that the twenty-fifth section
of the judicial act is limited by the constitution, and must be
construed so as to be confined within those limits; but he adds,
that a case can arise under the constitution or a treaty, only
when the right is created by the constitution or by a treaty
We think differently. This construction would defeat the
obvious purpose of the constitution, as well as of the act of congress. The language of both instruments extends the jurisdiction of this court to rights protected by the constitution,
treaties, or laws of the United States, from whatever source
those rights may spring.
To sustain the jurisdiction of the court in the case now
under consideration, it must be shown that the title set up by
the city of New Orleans, is protected by the treaty ceding
Louisiana to the United States, or by some act of congress applicable to that title. The counsel in support of the motion
contends, and we think correctly, that the treaty does not embrace the case.
The first article makes the cession, and the second describes
its extent, as comprehending every right vested in France.
The third is expressed in these words, "the inhabitants of the

JANUARY TERM 1835.
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cucullu.]

ceded territory shall be incorporated in the union of the United
States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the federal constitution, to the enjoyment of all the
rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United
States, and in the mean time they shall he maintained and
protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and
the religion which they profess." No other article of the treaty
is supposed to contain any stipulation for the rights of individuals. This article obviously contemplates two objects. One,
that Louisiana shall be admitted into the union as soon as possible, upon an equal footing with the other states, and the
other, that, till such admission, the inhabitants of the ceded
territory shall be protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion. Had any one of these rights been
violated while this stipulation continued m force, the individual
supposing himself to be injured, might have brought his case
into this court, under the twenty-fifth section of the judicial
act. But this stipulation ceased to operate when Louisiana
became a member of the union, and its inhabitants were "admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States." The right to bring
questions of title decided in a state court, before this tribunal,
is not classed among these immunities. The inhabitants of
Louisiana enjoy all the advantages of American citizens, in
common with their brethren in their sister states, when their
titles are decided by the tribunals of the state.
The counsel for the appellant scarcely hopes to maintain the
jurisdiction of the court-under the treaty, but seems to rely on
the act of congress for admitting the state of Louisiana into the
union. The section of that act which is supposed to apply, is
in these words, "be it enacted, &c., that the said state shall
become, and is hereby declared to be one of the United States
of America, and admitted into the union on an equal footing
with the original states in all respects whatever, by the name
and title of the state of Louisiana."
This simply carries into execution the third article of the
treaty of cession, and cannot, as has already been observed,
be construed to give appellate jurisdiction to this court over all
questions of title between the citizens of Louisiana. If in any
case such jurisdiction could be supposed to be given, it might

SUPREME COURT
[City of New Orleans v. Armas and Cuculla.]

be where an act of congress attempted to divest a title which
was vestel under the pre-existing government. Therefore, the
counsel opposing the motion, contends, that the jurisdiction of
the court is involved in the merits of the controversy, and cannot be separated from them. We do not think so. The
controversy inthe state court was between two titles the one
originating under the French, the other under the Spanish
government. It is true the successful party had obtained a
patent from the United States, acknowledging the validity of

his previous incomplete title under the king of Spain. But
this patent did not profess to destroy any previous existing
title, nor could it so operate, nor was it understood so to operate by the state court. It appears from the petition filed in
the district court, that the patent was issued in pursuance of
the act of the l1th of May 1820, entitled "an act supplementary to the several acts for the adjustment of land claims in the
state of Louisiana." That act confirms the titles to which it
applies, "against any claim on the part of the United States."
The title of the city of New Orleans would not be affected by
this confirmation. But, independent of this act, it is a principle applicable to every grant, that it cannot affect pre-existing
titles. The United States v Arredondo, 6 Peters 738.
The judgment of the state court appears. on the record to
have depended on, and certainly ought to have depended on
the opinion entertained by that court, of the legal rights of the
parties under the crowns of France and Spain. The case involves no principle on which this court could take jurisdiction,
which would not apply to all the controversies respecting titles
originating before the cession of Louisiana to the United States.
It would also comprehend all controversies concerning titles
in any of the new states, since they are admitted into the union
by laws expressed in similar language.
The wit of error is dismissed, this court having no jurisdiction in the cause.

On consideration of the motion made in this cause on a
prior day of the present term of this court, to wit, on Saturday
the 24th of January past, and of the arguments of counsel
