H I. S was a Scire Fadas againfi the Garniflee in a Foreig-h
â€¢L.tlachnient, upon the trial ot which the confidential agent,
or faaor, of the original Defendants, who was cafually attending
in Court, was offered as a witnefs to prove effe&s in the hands of
the Garnifhee.
Levy, obje&ed to the admiffion -ofthe witnefs; and contended,
that he- ought not to be allowed, or, at leaft compelled, to give
evidence of matters confidentially communicated to him as an
agent; andthat the Court had-then-no Power over him as a witnefs.
becaufe he had not bccnfubpna'dto attend.
T

But by SatPPEN, Prfident:-It would be of very dangerous
confequence, if it was eflabihed, that a commercial agent was
not amenable as a witnefs in a Court of Juflice, in a catife againft
his conflituent. It is ifraining the maiter of privilege too far:
And, if the law makes him a witnefs, we are too fond of getting
at the truth, to permit him to excufe himfelf from declaring it,
becaufe. he conceives, that, in point*of delicacy, it would be a
breachof confidence.
BY THE COURT :-Let the witnefs be affirmed.
