HoCKER.

HIS was an adion of debt brought upon a band bearing date
the 24th of April, 1779, and conditioned for the payment of
.5oo. lawful moey of Pennfylvania. To-the Plaintiff's demand
the Defdndant pleadtd.payment, and iffie was ttlcreupon joined.
On the trial, of tbe caufe, Sergeant, in order to prove payment.to
the Treafurer agreeably to.the tender law, offered to read thc following 'certificate to- ihe Jury-.. Received -29 th March, 178c,
"of Mr. George -locker, the fium ot373. b. 6. being two thirds
"ofa bond and- .intereA due (hi Mr.. f. Yahnfon of Germantown,
"which he refufed to receive when . egalv tenderc&to him in ree ce vf

Lewis, for the Plainiff, objedted to'the evidence, that this was
not a certificate merely official; but containing certain .cytra judiciat fa&s, to which Snowden, like any other wirnel, ought t& be
produced and fworn, The confequence of admitting it, would be
bighty dangerous.
Sergeant anfwered, that'what was furplufage miglit be'rejecqed,
and the paper go to the Juryprnly 7-s proof of the receipt of the.money. If a Notary in Eng h&a introduced foreign matter into the
proteft of a bill of exchange, the Court would firike out fo much as
was -furplufage, but would never lupprefs, the whole. Snowden
could eafily on this occafion be produced; but fimdar cafes may
occur at a diflance, in which it would be impr-,&icable, and great
inconveniency and iniuftice would rifult ftom twe precedent.
