Affignee of Baynton'verf. HUGHES EX.

T.OHN HUGHES, the 16th of. Fbruary 1763, gave his beed

to .,btn Bayntn, conditioned for the payment of one thou fnd
pounds. On the 3 d September, x764, J hn Baynton and Sainu4
IP7aTrton, became bound jointly and feverally, to 7ohn Hughes ir a
bond conditioned for the payment of fix hundred and eight pounds
fifteen fhillings. 0n the 8th of Aay 1765, 7ohn Bayntcn, afligned
the one thouland pound bond to the plaintiff, Ann ifheeer, for a
juR debt, Ihe being ignorant of any dealing, between Hughes an.d
Baynton. This aaion was brought on the affigned.bond ; the defendint pleaded payment, and offerd in evidence the bond dated in
September, in bar of the plaintiff's recovery. To this the council
f6r the plaintiff obje&ed, and this day, viz. 23 d April, the caufe
came on to be argued.
The Council for the Plaintiffcontended, that by the * & of affembly, bonds, bills and notes were negotiable, as promifforv notes
in England under the 3 and 4 Ann. cap. 9 ; that negotiability imported a currency from hand to hand ;. that this a61 of affembly was
formed on the plan of the flatute, in many places ufing the fame
words, and being made for the fime purpofe, viz. to encuragctrae:
and onterce, which could only be effeed by fich a conftru&ion,
as that an afligned bond Ihould have a currency, from Hand to hand,
and that the poffeffor fhould recover, independent of any contradts
or dealings between the obligor and obligee; that the claufe in the
a& of affembly, " Should commence and profecute his, her, or their
a&ions at law, for the recovery of the money mentioned in fuch
" bonds or notes, or fo" much thereof, as thadl appear to be due at
" the timeof fuclr affignment," meant as lhll appear on the face.
of the inftrument itfelf-That, for this reafon, the obligor lhould
either guard, in making the contra&, by leaving out the negotiablewords', or fhouldget his payments indorfed on the bonds; that the"
words, " Tor recover as the'perfon or perfons to whom the fame
was or were made payable," only referred to the mode of recovery,
where the allignee brought his aaion in his own name, as he might
ufider this a&t; that any 9ther conftru6ion would defeat the intention of the a&, which was to ericou r e trade and commerce; but
if the aflignee was to take the bond fubje& to the dealing between
the obligor and abligee, there was an end of this fpzcics of'traffick, as
no one would ever take an a ligned bond in the courle of trade, or in
any other cafe,but of a doubtfil or defpeiate debt.
To fhew that a third perfon, coming in konaJfiee, and for a valuable
onfideration, would be in a better fituation than his vehdor, the.

It was contehded farther by the plaintiff, 3hat the a& of affembly
had changed the nature of thefe. contrads ; that they were not to be
conftrued on commercial principles only; that the do6lrine of the
lefendant eftablifhed this principle, that it was nudurmpal1um, there
was no confideration at the time of the bond being given or affigned.
To which it was anfwered, thit3 judging on commercial principles,
Awant of confideration was no objeffion,.for there is no fuch

above cafes, btit denied the application ; infifting thzt they fgood
upon quite a different footing-That nothing m,re .t as meant by
the af, thahi to give aflignees the benefit of fuing in their own
nimes and preventing any releafe, or othe*r dealings, affetng the
aflignee after aflignment once made; that in EBgland, a-bond paffes

a law, being often made by the clerks in Parliament; that trade Uv.-I
ttnd commerce, would be beft promoted by their conftru&ion, as it
would only impofe a duty on a perfon taking a bond, to enquire
in what lite it gtood.
That in cafeof bonds thiffaid, orloft, nomoney could be paid on
them ; that the intention of the Legiflature was to make thefe bonds,
bills, &c. fubje& to a common law remedy, and fubfitute the doctrine ofthe courts of equity in England in this Province, andno farthei.
That it was evident, that a general negotiability was noi intended;
.if it had, the Legiflature would not have varied the expreflion in
thofe parts of the itatutes, cxprefsly refering to inland bills of e,change, and making promiffory fiotes negotiable as bill* of exchange; the a& of affembly, on the other hand, exprefling fuch
a recovefy by aflignee as the affigner courd have hadi and confining
the recovery to fuch money as was due at the time of the affignment.
That this was further confirined by the laft claufe ofthea&, Which
prohibits the affignee releafing any money afuially,- or really, due;
rhat cuftom and pra6ice, which are goodexpofitors of laws, are
with them; and that fhe featute of 4. and 5 Ann. being declared offi
fliews it was the fenfe of the Praditioners, that promiffory inotes are
not negotiable here as in England. That t to the defalcation a&, it
is a remedial law, and to be extended by equity to all cafes withir
the fame mifchief; that though that part of it, which gives a fcire
facias, does not apply to this cafe, yet the otlier partdoes; ahd the
defendant is fairly within"the reafon of it.
The council for the plaintiff, in reply, adinitted the law in Englani
as laid down by the defendant in the cafe of bonds; arid, that betoithe fitute, promiffory notes were 6nly evidence of a debt; there was
no property transfered ; but that the a& of affembly and' aa of parliament, Ieing rniadeparimateria, are to receive the like cbnfru&ion.Â¢
That ihe co'nftri&ion made by the defendanti would render the
a& nugatory-That merelV-to give the affignee a right of fuing in his
own name, unlefsfome folid advantage attended it, was trifling, nor
would it at all encourage trade and commerce.' That a limited
negotiability, was an abfurdit,; it muff be negotiable, or not; if
negoti;ble, it was fo in all cafes when honeftly come by, of
not at all, That the intention of the at mutt wholly fail, if
aflignee is only to fland in the place ot aflignor, and his recovery
made to depend on circumftances and proofs, which, in the nature
of things, are not in his power, That to fay the affignee quti
make inquiry before.he meddles with the bond, is begging the
queftion. We coritend, that this aa of affembly meant fomethingi
and that was, for the fake of trade and commerce, to annex a property in the Oebt, and a"cbrrency to'the paper, and to improve vigilance.in *the debtor, to take care either to guard his contra& in the
fiift inftance, or in cafe of payment, or other fatdisaf.ion, to fee his
payments indbrfed or his bond cancelle&

Cnnw, Cbief 7uj;ce. The queftiorin this cafe is, whether
Rtlughts an have the same defalcation againf Wheeler, whizh hle couid

have had againi Baynton, if this hgd not been alligned,
It was conteuded for the Plaintifl; that bonds were negotiable as
inland bills ol- exchange.
. -It was 4lfo conternded, that defalcation by the aa, is only wher;
there are dealings between-the parties.
For the defendant it was contcnded, that the a&t does not make
them .Pegotialle, as bills and notws. are by the itatute of 3 ad +
Jim. c. 9.
It is plain h6wever that the at was drawn from tne flatute, for in
ri n places it follows it, loiidrn verhs, though in ot crs it varies.
This fhews the legillature intended in thofe inflances, ta vary the
law. .Bills in England were ntgotiable before thp itute; nates
were only evidence of i debt the atute was made to put them ons
the fame footing with bills.
The quellio, is whether the a& of a~lembly has done the f.:me"
as the fatute. "" e th-e compared, the aa with the fhn'te, 1lie'
that it was drawn from the ftatute,
The aa however fays, " for the encouragenent of trade, cdmand credit;" the flatute adds," and to make notes nego.nerce
tiable in the famemannbr as bills,"This is a materialvariance, and.
is carried through the at.
The Defendant relied on the words in the a& entitling affigne-"
to recover the money, that ihould appear to be due, inlike manner as
obligee could.
Here is the'fame variance as before; for, by the ftatute, the
aflfignee is to recover what Ihall be due, " in like manner as -indorfee of a bill -of exchange."-Had the a& purfued the ftatute in
theft refpeas, or expreffed the fame weaning in other words; the
plaintiff would be right.
What flall appear to be due at the time of the affigniment, has
been differently, applied'by the oppofite council ;-The Plaintiff's
council contended, that it meant what appeared to be due on-the
bond ;' fo that, if the bond fhould be paid, yet if payment was nor
indorfed, the affigheie might recover the whole..
* The Defendant contended, that the claufe related only to the manner of proceeding, enabling the affignee to fue in his own name.
We have confidered this matter very deliberately, and are clearly
of opinion, that the variance between the af and the ftatute, was
intentional, not accidental. ,
, An argument of force with us, not. mentioned by the defendant,
arifes from the wording of the ac.
The words" fo much as fhall appear to be 'due," relate t6 the
time of trial, and not to tke time of the affignment ;-they are in
the future tcnfe.

ruled and adjudged in the

tt has been faid, that it is the obligor's fault not to have the pay-i
indorfed on the bond ; but it is not in his power, for the moneF
muft be paid before he is entitled to a receipt; and then, if tho

We are, therefore dearly of opinion, that an affignee takes the
bond at his own peril; nd that he ftands in the fame place as tho
