N this caufe, .the defendant's offered in evidence an entry mad&
in the books of the teftator, of money paid in difcharge of a
promiffory note. This was acknowledged to be the orignal entry;
but. there was no proof by whom it was made, or, whethar the
perfon who made it was dead; or alive,.
BY THE COURT. Let it be read to the jury; not as evidence
that tlhe defendant has paid the note, but merely that fuch an entry
was made nineteen years ago, of the payment of a note of twentythree years flanding; and to fupport the general prefumption of
payment after fudh a length of time. Nor is this to be drawn into
precedent; for ourallowance of the evidence is founded on the
particular circumftances of this cafe.
To p rove another point in the fame caufe, a boa$ was offerecd
in the form of a ledger, containing, in fome inflances, referrences
to awafte-book;--I-Notwithlanding this, it was infifted, on the one
hand, to be an original., and not a tianfcript ; but denied on the
other; and the perfon, who, it was faid, could prove it, was in.
capable of attending on account of ficknefs.THE COURT ordered the'book to be read; leaving it to the jury
" to determine-,, on the face of it, whether it was an original or
tranfcript and .direaing them in the latter cafe, to pay no regard
