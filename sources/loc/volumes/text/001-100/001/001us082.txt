LE m veYus B 0LTON.

MOTION was made, the Toth of Novem3tr, on the part of the
defendant, to fet afide the return of the jury of inquiry, on
affidavit of irregular proceedings; and the Court granted a rule
to ihew caufe &c.
And now two of the jurors attended and depofed, that Leib's
'book, fupported by his own oath, had been admitted as evidence
of the delivery of a quantity of leather by Leib, to the order of
Bolton, in part difcharge of an agreement between them. But
being afked, whether they founded their inqueft in any degree
upon that evidence, they Iaid it was founded upon that, and concurrent teftimon y.
In fupport of the motion it was contended, that, though the
*admiflion of books in the manner above flated, had been cuftomary ; yet- that the cuftom ought not to be carried farther than to
prove work done, or vares delivered; that the purpofe for which
they had been introduced, on the prefent occafion, arofe upon a
collateral point; to eftablifh a fett off in diminution of the damages, and that it was, therefore, irregular to admit them. With refpe& to the concurrent 'teftimony mentioned by the jurors, it was'
faid, that as neither the nature, or effe& of it, appeared to the
Court, it might have been evem more improper than the allowance of the books as evidence ; but that, in all events, the inqueft
9ught to be Let afide, as what did appear, Thews it to have been
raifed fo fAr upon an erroneous foundation.
A

' But, BY THE CoURT : We will not fet afide the verdi6ls of juries of inquiry; nor the reports of referrees, upon frivolous grounds.
Nor, will we examine into the effe& of any particular piece of evidence upon the minds of the jury ; for, unlefs it appears, that there
was no proper evidence before them, we muff prefume that they
had fufficient grounds for their inqueft.

The Rule difcharged.
