CALDWELL.

THIS was an inditment for a Nufance, in ereffing 'a wharf on
Vt the-public property. The defendant offered'witnefses to prove
that the ere&ion of the wharf has been beneficial to the public, and,
therefore, not to be regarded s a Nuifance.
But M'KEAN, Chief 7uflice, delivered the opinion of the Court,
that the evidence was inadmilrible, for two reafons: -/r, Becaufe
it would only amount to matter of opinion, whereas it is on ia&s
the Court muff proceed; and the neceffary fa~qs are already in
proof. Secondly; Becaufe it would be no juftification ; for, on the
fame principle that the defendant might carry his wharf 12 feet, he
eould juftify extending it farther; or any other man might excufe
a fimilar intrufion. Suppofe, for inflance, a ftreet were 6o feet
wide, 12 feet might be -taken off it, without doing any material
injury to the public property, or creating any great obftru6lion to
pAfingers ; yet, furely this will not jiiftity any man's aaually building upon, and affuming the property of the i 2 feet that could be-thus
fpared.
