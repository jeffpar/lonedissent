N a Oueftion, whether the original private Book of Memorandums-of the Secretary of the Land Oilice, refoe&iing the Dedcriptionnf the Land originally applied for, ihould be given in Evidence, it was urged that this Book, containing the original Entrieg
from which the Minutes of Property are formed, is the beft Evidence and therefore ought to be admitted. THE COuRT faid it was
a Matter of Confequence; and recommended-it to the Coociil of the
other Side to confent to the Book's being given in Evidence; which
was accordingly done, and no Determination given by the Court.
