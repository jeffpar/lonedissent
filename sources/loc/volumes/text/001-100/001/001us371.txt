There maft then be fome collateral matter, fome injury to the 1788.
Plaintiff, or benefit to the Defendant, in the confideration itfejff laid
as a ground for the affumption. It the Defendant had promifedto
the Plaintiff, having poffeffion of the note, and a power to fue for
the money (though not in his own name) that if he would forbear
to fue him, he would pay it; or, if the promife had been in collfideration of his delivering the note up to be cancelled ; thefe proimifes, though made to a porfon not having an aflignment of the
note, would perhaps have been fufficient to ground an afanpfitupon.
But this is a bare promife to pay to the Plaintiff, a ftranger, in
confideration of a fale and delivery of the note by the payee to him,
a confideration moving neither to, nor from, the Defendant, and
which could not redound either to his benefit or injury.-Beides,
the promife laid, istopay to the Plairitiff, according to the finor-and
efee of the note, and the tenor and effe& of the note was to pay to
Yee'row, or his order, and not to any perfon to whom he thould fell
and deliver it.

If the note had been payable to 7effyiroew, or Bearer,

a bonafide purchafer of it might have maintained the aclion ; becaule fuch notes pafs by delivery: But a note payable to order, muft
be ajigned, to enable the holder to bring the a&ion in his own name.
Bonds in England are every day afligned, attended with irrevocable powers to fue for the aflignees ufe: Such an affignment one
would think would be full evidence of a fale and delivery, -yet no
a&ions are ever brot'ght on that ground, but always in the name ot
the obligees.
We would intend every thing we could to fupport the verdi&;
from thattowhich
but we cannot intend a confideration quite differentwe
giv.were
if
is laid, which we muftdo in the prefent cafe,
our opinion in favor of thePlaintiff.
Thejudginent, therefore, muft bearrefted.

in which, alter a trial in the Supreme Cour, he obtained ajudgment.

iffued. On the fourth day of the fame month, however, the Defendant lhaving then confeffed judgment in this Court to the Plain.
tiff, Benjamin Gibbs, a F. fa; was iffued in this caufe, and duly
executed upon a houfe and lot of ground in Pbi!adelhia; after which
Mrs. Gibbs committed an act of bankruptcy, and the Sheriff paid
the money levied by virtue of the F2i.fa. into' the hands of the rothonotary, to be difpofed of as the Court ihould dire&.

that the ftatute and our a& of Affembly made no other alteration in

miflioners if not prevented by the execution, that, therefore,. the x788.
quefflon lay properly between Gibbs and the Aflignees, and not
between him and Mufgrcw, who could not, with any fhew of right
retain the money againfl the general creditors, even if the Court
were, at this time, to order it to be paid to him. They faid, that
the very points now made, were urged and over-ruled in the cafe
cited for A(ufgrcve ; I P. Wn. 737. and it is declared in feveral
cafes, that a judgment did not bind lands any more than the tefit of
a Fi.fa. did goods, befbre the ftatute. Ibid. 9-z Vf 239.436.
But the very exiflence of a prior lien in favor of ZIIufgrove was
controverted; becaufe the a6t ofAflimbly (i State Laws 467. 3Jin
refpe&a to the docketing of judgments, only alters the law in the
cafe of bonafide purchafbrs for a valuable confideration; and does
not affe& the cafe of two judgment creditors, whofe liens frill relate
to the firft day of the term.. On this 'ground, therefore,. the judgment confellid to Gibbs in the Commn Pleas, is prior to that obtained by PAlqfgrov . in the Supreme Court; for the term in the Cornmn Pleas commenced on the 7th o S,'teenter; but the term in the
,Sztw'eme Court did uot commence .unrit the 24th day of the fame
rnoMh; fo that, hideptndent of the bankrupt law, the legal relation to th]w firfi d. y of the telin eltablities the right of Gib, on the
prt-fiut controverfy.
Eut the bankrupt law is in itfelf clearly decifive; and that an advcrfe precedent is ndt to be found, muff prove the uni, erfal fenfe of
the Courts of Juffice in Engl4nd to be in favor of the Plaintiff's
do&rine. As,. therefore, the general rule, with regard to an execution: executed, includes his cafe, and excludes the cafi of Miufgre, it .is incumbent upon the latter to fhew, if he .can, any exception on which he may reft his prefent claim. The principle,
indet d, as well as the praffice of the law, is on the fame lide. If,
after the execution executed, the commiflioners had taken the
houif and fold it, they would, undoubtedly, have been liable to
Gibbs in an a6lion for money had and received to his ufe: but will
it be ailerted that Mzfrsove could maintain fuch n naion, having
no execution executed-? Nor can it be juftiy faid, that the commiffioners are not intereftkd in the quefltion now agitated; for, if
the proceeds of the eflate fold under the Fi. ft. are enough to pay
both, both, according to the oppofite doehine, mvft be paid, and
only the balance go to the commifloncrs. But there it no cafe
which can make a difference whether the money is, or is not, Rffficient to pay the amount of the execution; and fhould Afqfgrve
prevail againif Gibbs, for fimilar reafons lie muft prevail againl
the commiffioners-to the manifeff violation of the Words and fpitit of the law.

SuFirP-N, Prefident.-The motion ;n this care is made in behalf' of one ul'ujgrve, who is faid to be a prior judgment creditor,
in order to have the money which has been levied and.brought it'o
Court under the Plaintit's" execution, paid to him inflead of the
Thiv
Plaintiff.

CAsEs ruled and adjudged in the

This is obje&ed io, on the ground that the Defendant became a
bankrupt previous to the ferving or iffuing any execution againft the
eflate, except the prefent one, at the fuit of the Plaintiff, and that,
therefore, he alone is entitled to the money.
The queffion arifes upon the 3oth Stgion of the bankrupt la-.,
which ena&s, "That every creditqr having fecurity for his debt by
"judgment, fpeciality, or other fechrity, whereof there is no exe"cution ferved and 'executed upon the lands, goods, and eftate, of
"'the bankrupt before -fuch time as he fliall
become a bankrupt,
"hhall not be'relieved upon any fuch judgment, &c for any more
" than a rateable part of their debts, with the other creditors."
This fe&ion of the a&, is fimilar to one in the Itatute of Yames,
and mull therefore receive the fame conftru&ion ; and the rational
and legal conftru&ion appears to be, that no judgment creditor who
has not levied his execution, fhall ree.eive any benefit from his judgment, as to te lae or effees of the bankrupit,ve/)edin the Conimioners
of bankruptcy by the a&, to the exciufon or prejudice of the creditors at

large, but muff be put upon the fame footing with them; yet, as
to any liens which do nor affe& the general creditors, he will have
the benefit of them in the fame manner as if the a&tr had never been
mnade.
This conftru6tion accords with the cafe cited in fupport of the
motion out of i. Peere 0'lns. 737. The principle of that cafe, fo
far as refpe~s the prefent purpofe, is this, that where there is a
prior judgment, and afterwards a fale of the toland,
and then a banklandfubje7 the prior lien, which

it could only fubfift

and was not at all

whether it fi'bfifted or not.

nlthe prefent cafe1 there has been no a& of the party previous to

the bankrupcy to prevent the veiling of the eftate inathe Commifioncr; and, confequently, all liens, if they operate at all, uft operate
to their prejudice; which is contrary to the exprefs intent or the

fatisfied, before
ite Commifioners could take any
to divide among thegenra

It is faid, that, although the Court hould order the prior judg.ent cieditor to be firth
paid, there would be no injurydone to the
oter crejditors, becafe the Commiftioners might recover the muney frm him, if jdot

or could not, recover it from him, will, I think, make no :...erial difference as to the prefent motion.

It mulf, however, be ob-

ferved, that, if he can claim this money at all, it muft be under the
,xecution, and as execution creditors are lived, it would be very
queftionable whether the Commiffioners could rezover it from him.
If they couldnot, then the creditors at large mull be poftponed to
him and the other judgment crdditors ;-if they could recover it,
then it would not only be a vain thing to order the money into his
hands, as he muff, by a circuity of a&ion, be obliged to refund it,
but it would, in fat, be ordering it into the hand; of a perfon not
intitled to receive it: And the confeqtfence would be, that the real
execution creditor, whofe claim is faved by the a&, would infallibly be cut out of his preference.
Whetherthisis, or is not, a hmafide debt, is not the fubje.t of
0ur prefent enquiry. If any fraud could b- proved, this Court
would certainly on motion fet afide b3th the execution and the
judgment, but that could ndt be for the benefit of the prior judgment creditor, whofe claim is found:d u.5an t. cxecutioz ; but for
the benefit of the creditors at larg- tinder the Commilflion; who
may fill have a remedy by a&ion, if they can Ili--w the execution
to have been collufive and unfair.
The only quelhon, however, now betore us, is whether a prior
judgment creditor fhall come in unde.r this excccuion, whizh we
-think he cannot, as it wouJd defeat the exprefs intent of the bankrunt la.2W
