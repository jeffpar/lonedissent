a proportion of that fum, went towards payment of the illegal intereft included in the original note.
Second.-The ufurious contract was Rlated ih feveral Counts of the

of one thing in"fatisfaiion of another, is a good payment; as the
acceptance of a horfe in lieu of a fum of money; or of a bond by a

Fourth.-THxCOURT left it to the Jury to determine whether

might be madeof a bond or-note, even at 2o or 30 per cent. difcount,
without incurring the dangers bf ufury ; and, if, upon the prefent
occhfion the Defendant had run the riflue of a forgery, the prefumption ought to operate in her favor, that, for this reafon, fhe"
had bought the note at a depreciated price.
