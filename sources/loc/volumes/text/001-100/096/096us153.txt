O 0HLSAAT V. MURPHY.

Three points were ruled by the Circuit Court: 1. That, unless the protest set forth distinctly and specifically the ground
of the objection to the amount claimed, it fails to meet the
requirement of the act of Congress. 2. That the office of the
protest is to point out to the officers of the customs the precise
errors of fact or of law which render the exaction of the duty
unauthorized. 8. That the plaintiffs are precluded from insisting that their importation was a manufacture of silk not
otherwise provided for, and subject to a duty of fifty per cent
instead of sixty, when, by their protest, they allege it to be
-wearing-apparel, &c.-, subject to a duty of thirty-five per cent.
Satisfactory reasons in support of these conclusions are given
by the circuit judge, to which it will be sufficient to refer,
without repetition. Davies v. Arthur, 13 Blatchf. 84; Norcross v. Greeley, 1 Curt. 120.
Apply these principles to the case before the court, and it is
clear that there is no error in the record.
Judgment affirmed.

KOHLSAAT V. IURPHY.
1. The joint resolution of March 2, 1867 (J4 Stat. 571), repealing that portion
of the fifth section of the act approved June 30, 1864 (13 id. 208), which
subjected to a duty of ten per cent ad valorem "lastings, nmohair cloth, silk,
twist, or other manufacture of cloth, woven or made in patterns of such
size, shape, and form, or cut in such manner, as to be fit for sles, slippers,
boots, bootees, gaiters, and buttons exclusively, not combined with indiarubber," did not revive the provision in the twenty-third section of the act
of larch 2, 1861 (12 id. 195), which placed such articles on the free list.
2. Patterns imported in 1870, made of cotton canvas cut into strips of the size
and shape for slippers, more or less embroidered with worsted and silk,
were dutiable under the last paragraph of the sixth section of the act of
June 30, 1864 (13 Stat. 209), which imposes a duty of thirty-five per cent ad
valorem on "manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for."

[Sup. Or.

MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Repeal by implication of revenue and collection laws, except
when the prior laws have been subjected to a general statutory
revision, are not favored in legal decision, unless it appear that
the prior provision has been re-enacted in the new regulation,
or that the later act is repugnant to the former; and the Revised Statutes provide in express terms that, whenever an act
is repealed which repealed a former act, such former act shall
not thereby be revived unless it shall be expressly so provided.
Rev. Stat., sect. 12, p. 2.
Six invoices of merchandise were imported into the port of
New York, designated as embroidered slipper-patterns, being
the ordinary slipper-patterns made of cotton canvas cut into
strips of the size and shape for slippers, more or less embroidered with worsted and silk. Due entry of the goods described
in the invoice was made at the custom-house of the port; and
enough appears to show that the collector liquidated the duties
at thirty-five per cent ad valorem, holding that the importations
were subject to duty under the last clause of sect. 6 of the act
of June 30, 1864, as other manufactures of cotton not otherwise
provided for, certain articles of cotton manufacture therein
previously named being declared subject to the same rate of
duty. Appeal to the Secretary of the Treasury and due protest by the importers are admitted.
Payment was made by the importer under protest; and his
executors instituted the present action of assumpsit in the State
court, subsequently removed into the Circuit Court, and there
prosecuted, to recover the excess of duty which, as they allege,
the collector unlawfully exacted, and which the importer was
compelled to pay to get possession of his goods. Protest was
made upon two grounds : 1, That the goods were duty free under
the act of March 2, 1861 (12 Stat. 195); or, 2, that the goods
were subject to a duty of ten per cent ad valorem only, under
the act of July 14, 1862, entitled an act increasing temporarily
the duties on imports. " Id. 650.
- Instead of that, the United States contended in the court
below, and still contend, that the decision of the collector, as
approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, is correct, and that
the goods imported were subject to an ad valorem duty of thirtyfive per cent.

IKOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

Appropriate issues being joined, the parties went to trial, and
the verdict and judgment were for the defendant. Exceptions
were taken by the plaintiffs, and they sued out the present writ
of error.
Questions of fact were determined by the jury, and the questions of law presented for decision are the same as those raised
in the protest; or, in other words, the plaintiffs still maintain
the two theories there set up: 1. That the goods imported were
duty free; 2. That, if they were not duty free, they were subject only to an ad valorem duty of ten per cent.
Import duties of ten per cent ad valorem were imposed by
the act of June 30, 1864, on lastings, mohair cloth, silk, twist,
or other manufactures of cloth, woven or made in patterns of
such size, shape, and form, or cut in such manner, as to be fit
for shoes, slippers, boots, bootees, gaiters, and buttons exclusively, not combined with india-rubber, which duty, it will be
observed, is imposed upon the enumerated articles by name.
Extensive lists of enumerated goods made of silk or wool, as
well as of cotton, are also given in the fifth, sixth, and eighth
sections of the act, which are made subject to the duty or rate
of duty there provided. Manufactures of silk, or of which silk
is the component material of chief value, not otherwise provided
for, are there made subject to a duty of fifty per cent ad valorem.
Provision is also made that all manufactures of wool of every
description, made wholly or in part of wool, not otherwise provided for, twenty-four cents per pound, and, in addition thereto,
forty per cent ad valorem. Cotton goods, to a large extent,
are placed in the enumerated list; but the further provision is,
that all other manufactures of cotton, not otherwise provided
for, shall be subject to a duty of thirty-five per cent ad valorem.
Goods of the kind imported, if made of cotton, were, beyond
all doubt, when that act went into operation, subject to a duty
of ten per cent ad valorem, under the clause enumerating that
class of goods and imposing that rate of duty. 13 id. 208.
Rates of duty on these articles remained unchanged from that
time until the passage of the joint resolution of the 2d of
March, 1867, which repealed the paragraph in sect. 5 of the
act of June 30, 1864, enumerating the articles, and imposing a
duty of ten per cent ad valorem on the same. Wool is also

KOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

[Sup. Ot.

included in the repealing clause; but that circumstance does not
diminish the effect of the argument, as every article enumerated
in the paragraph in question is specifically named in the repealing joint resolution. 14 id. 511.
Customs duties from that date were levied and collected on
all the articles enumerated in that paragraph, if manufactured
of cotton, at the rate of thirty-five per cent ad valorem; the
ruling of the department being, that the repeal of the clause
enumerating the articles left the same dutiable under the clause
imposing a duty of thirty-five per cent on all manufactures of
cotton not otherwise provided for in the same act.
Manufacturers of buttons complained that their business
could not bear so high a rate of duty, and Congress, at their
request, amended the joint resolution referred to, and took buttons out of its operation, the effect of which was that l.stings,
mohair cloth, silk, twist, or other manufactures of cloth, woven
or made in such manner as to be fit for buttons exclusively,
became dutiable under the clause repealed by the before-mentioned joint resolution, and only at the rate of ten per cent
ad valorem.
Collated in this manner, these statutory regulations are as
plain in their construction as any thing which depends upon a
revenue act of Congress well can be. Cloth of the kind intended
for buttons is dutiable at ten per cent ad valorem ; but all the
other articles of manufactured cloth, woven or made of cotton,
in patterns of such size, shape, and form, or cut in such manner,
as to be fit for shoes, slippers, bootees, or gaiteis, are dutiable
under the clause embracing manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for, at the rate of thirty-five per cenit ad valorem.
Attempt at one time was made, as indicated in the second
ground of the protest, to maintain the proposition that the
repeal by the joint resolution referred to, of the enumerating
paragraph in the act of June 30, 1864, revived the same provision in the act of July 14, 1862, which imposed the same
duty as the repealed paragraph. 12 id. 550; Butler v. liussell,
11 int. Rev. Rec. 30.
Eminent counsel urged the proposition ; but the court held
otherwise, for reasons which are entirely satisfactory. Nor is
it necessary to examine that question, as the plaintiffs in this

Oct. 1877.]

KOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

case abandon that theory, and rest their case entirely upon the
first ground assumed in the protest, - that the goods imported.
are exempt from duty; or, in other words, that the effect of
the joint resolution under consideration was to repeal the paragraph in the two prior acts, to wit, the act of 1864 and the act
of 1862, and to revive the corresponding provision in the act of
the 2d of March, 1861, which included such goods in the free
list.
Cases arise undoubtedly where it is properly held that the
repeal of a repealing statute revives the old law; but the court
is of the opinion that the rule in that regard is inapplicable tW
the case before the court, for several reasons, which will more
fully appear from a review of the acts of Congress immediately
preceding the act under which the duties in this case were
levied and collected.
Temporary increase of import duties, to the extent of fifty
per cent on the rates authorized by law, was imposed on the
29th of April next preceding the passage of that act, by the
joint resolution of that date. 13 Stat. 405. But the events of
that period required stable regulations, and it was the evident
intention of Congress, in passing the act in question, to effect
a permanent increase of duties to meet the public exigency;
and they accomplished it in part by diminishing the free list
and by changing the basis of computation in ascertaining the
dutiable value of imported merchandise, and by including the
costs and charges in the appraisement. All prior acts upon
the subject, in force at the time, to the extent therein specified,
were revised; and it is safe to affirm that the articles enumerated
in that act were subject to no other duty than that which theact imposed.
Evidence to support that proposition is found in almost every
section of the act. No reference to any other act is made for
that purpose; but the twenty-second section of the act provides
that the existing laws shall extend to, and be in force for, the
collection of the duties imposed by this act, for the prosecution
and punishment of all offences, and for the recovery, collection,
distribution, and remission of all fines, penalties, and forfeitures, as fully and effectually as if every regulation, penalty,
forfeiture, provision, clause, matter, and thing to that effect in.

KOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

[Sup. Or.

the existing laws contained had been inserted in and re-enacted
in this act. Plain provision is also made that "the duties upon
all goods, wares, and merchandise imported from foreign countries, not provided for in this act, shall be and remain as they
were according to existing laws" at the time the joint resolution was passed which temporarily increased the rates of duties
fifty per cent. 13 id. 405.
These provisions must be taken in connection with the repealing clause of the act; and, when so considered, it is clear
that Congress intended to make a comprehensive and complete
revision to the extent specified, of all the antecedent acts imposing import duties. When a revising statute covers the
whole subject-matter of antecedent statutes, the revising statute virtually repeals the antecedent enactment, unless there is
something in the nature of the subject-matter or the revising
statute to indicate a contrary intention. Davies et al. v. Fairbairn et al., 3 How. 636; School District v. Whitehead, 2 Beas.
290.
None of these principles are controverted by the plaintiffs,
but still they insist that the joint resolution which repealed
the paragraph in the act of the 30th of June, 1864, imposing
the duty of ten per cent ad valorem on the goods, had the effect
to revive the provision in the act of 1861, which placed such
goods in the free list.
Nothing is contained in the joint resolution expressing any
such intention, or to indicate that Congress did not intend
exactly what followed, in case the antecedent provision is held
not to be revived. Congress has now provided that whenever
an act is repealed which repealed a former act, such former act
shall not thereby be revived, unless it shall be expressly so provided; but that provision was not in force when the cause of
action in this case arose, nor is it referred to for any other purpose than to show that such a conclusion ought not to be adopted
in a case where it is unreasonable to suppose that Congress
intended such a result.
Had it been supposed that such was the effect of the joint
resolution, the manufacturers of buttons would never have
applied for the relief which was granted to them by the second
joint resolution. Beyond all doubt, they applied for that relief

Oct. 1877.]

KOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

upon the ground that their importations were dutiable at thirtyfive per cent ad valorem; and it is equally certain that Congress granted the relief upon the ground that the second joint
resolution left the cloth which the manufacturers of buttons
imported subject to the duty of ten per cent ad valorem, as
imposed prior to the passage of the first joint resolution.
Public necessity demanded increased rates of import duties
when the joint resolution of the 29th of April, 1864, was
passed; and every one having any knowledge upon the subject
knows that the act of the 30th of June of that year was enacted
for the express purpose of increasing the rates of duty on foreign importations: nor is it any less certain that the repeal
of the paragraph in that act rendering the goods of the character in question dutiable at the rate of ten per cent ad valorem
was regarded by Congress and the Treasury Department, and
everybody else interested in the legislation, as a measure having the effect to augment the rate of duty from ten per cent ad
valorem to thirty-five per cent, as the duties were liquidated in
this case.
Customs duties on such importations, except where the article was woven or cut in patterns, so as to be fit for buttons
exclusively, were levied and collected pursuant to that view of
the law from the date of the repeal of that paragraph, March
arose.
2, 1867, to Nov. 15, 1870, when the present controversy
In the mean time, the manufacturers of cotton cloth intended
for buttons complained that they were oppressed, and Congress passed the joint resolution to relieve their grievance.
15 id. 24.
By that resolution, it was provided that the prior joint resolution shall not be considered to apply to lasting, mohair cloth,
silk, twist, or other manufactures of cloth, woven or made in
patterns of such size, shape, and form, or cut in such a manner,
as to be fit for buttons exclusively.
Viewed in the light of these provisions, it seems almost past
belief that the attentive reader should have any doubt as to the
intent of Congress or the legal effect of the joint resolution
which repealed the enumerating paragraph in the act passed to
increase duties on imports. ia id. 208.
In the exposition of statutes, the established rule is that the

KOHLSAAT V. IMURPHY.

[Sup. 0t.

intention of the law-maker is to be deduced from a view of the
whole statute, and every material part of the same; and where
there are several statutes relating to the same subject, they are
all to be taken together, and one part compared with another
in the construction of any one of the material provisions, because, in the absence of contradictory or inconsistent provisions,
they are supposed to have the same object and as pertaining to
the same system. Resort may be had to every part of a statute,
or, where there is more than one in pari materia, to the whole
system, for the purpose of collecting the legislative intention,
which is the important inquiry in all cases where provisions are
ambiguous or inconsistent.
Rules and maxims of interpretation are ordained as aids in
discovering the true intent and meaning of any particular enactment; but the controlling rule of decision in applying the statute in any particular case is, that, whenever the intention of the
legislature can be discovered from the words employed, in view
of the subject-matter and the surrounding circumstances, it
ought to prevail, unless it lead to absu rd and irrational conclusions, which should never be imputed to the legislature, except
when the language employed will admit of no other signification.
Apply these rules to the case before the court, and it is clear
that the goods imported in this case were subject to an ad valorem duty of thirty-five per cent, as appears from the following
considerations: 1. Importations of the bind were duty free under the act of
March 2, 1861, which placed "lastings, mohair cloth, silk,
twist, or other manufactures of cloth cut in strips or patterns
of the usual size and shape for shoes, slippers, bootees, gaiters,
and buttons exclusively, not combined with india-rubber, in
the free list. 12 id. 195.
2. Goods of the kind were subject to a duty, under the act of
July 14, 1862, of ten per cent ad valorem, the goods being described as follows: Lasting, mohair cloth, silk, twist, or other
manufacture of cloth, woven or made in patterns of such size,
shape, and form, or cut in such manner, as to be fit for shoes,
slippers, boots, bootees, gaiters, and buttons exclusively, not
combined with india-rubber.

Oct. 1877.]

KOHLSAAT V. MURPHY.

8. All of the provisions of those two tariff acts imposing
import duties, or prescribing the rates of such duties, were, to
the extent therein specified, revised by the act of June 30,
1864; and the provision there made in respect to the kind of
goods in question was as follows: "Lastings, mohair cloth, silk,
twist, or other manufacture of cloth, 'woven or made in patterns
of such size, shape, and form, or cut in such manner, as to be fit
for shoes, slippers, boots, bootees, gaiters, and buttons exclusively, not combined with india-rubber, ten per cent ad
valorem."
4. Congress, March 2, 1867, repealed that paragraph, as set
forth in the last-named act, reciting the paragraph in he verba,
adding therein the word "wool," showing conclusively that
Congress intended to repeal the entire paragraph, which had
been three times before incorporated into the tariff acts.
5. Manufacturers of buttons complained that the effect of
the repeal was to impose an ad valorem duty of thirty-five per
cent on fabrics designed and used for their manufacture, and
insisted that it was greater than their business could bear.
They were heard; and Congress, having become satisfied that,
their complaint was reasonable, passed the joint resolution of
the 29th of March, 1867, which provided that the prior joint
resolution repealing that paragraph "shall not be construed to
apply to lastings, mohair cloth, silk, twist, or other manufactures of cloth, woven or made in patterns of such size, shape,
and form, or cut in such manner, as to be fit for buttons exclusively," leaving it in full operation as to every other article in
the paragraph. 15 id. 24; Butler v. Russell, supra.
Weighed in the light of these suggestions, 'which are deduced
entirely from a comparison of the different provisions in the
acts of Congress upon the same subject, it seems impossible to
deny that the ruling of the circuit judge is correct.
Other questions were discussed at the bar, but they are not
material to the decision of the present case.
Judgment affirmed.
