ARTHUR V. STEPHANI.

Mr. Assistant-Attorney-GeneraZ Smith for the plaintiff in
error.
Mr.f . Davis, Jr., contra.
HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
The articles imported by the defendant in error are embraced
in the general words of the act of 1864, and, if there -were
nothing else in the case, would be subject to the duty therein
provided.
They are, however, commercially known as "hat braids,"
used exclusively for enamelling hats and bonnets. These articles are specifically enumerated in the acts of 1861 and 1862,
and are there made subject to a different and a lower duty.
By these acts, and by the Revised Statutes, Congress establishes and recognizes the distinction between "cotton braids"
and "other manufactures of cotton not otherwise provided for,"
and "hat braids." 12 Stat. 178; id. 543, 551; Rev. Stat.,
sect. 2504.
Under the principles laid down in Arthur v. Morrison,Arthur
v. Lahey, and Arthur v. Unkart (supra, pp. 108, 112, 118), the
specific designation should prevail; and the judgment in favor
of the plaintiff for the excess of duties paid by him -was right,
and must be affirmed.
Judgment affirmed.
MR. lUST O

ALTHUR v. STEPHNia.
1. For tariff purposes, Congress has at all times, since the passage of the act
of May 2, 1792 (1 Stat. 259), intended to preserve the distinction between.
"chocolate" and "confectionery."
2. Chocolate, eo nomine, is, by the first section of the act of June 6, 1872 (17 Stat.
231), dutiable at the rate of five cents per pound; and, although put up in.
a particular form and sold as "confectionery," is not subjected to the duty
imposed on the latter article by the first section of the act of June 30, 1864

(13 id. 202).

[Sup. Ot.

alleged excess of duty paid upon certain chocolate imported by
them from Liverpool, in 1873, and upon which the collector of
the port of New York, holding it to be "confectionery," exacted a duty of fifty cents per pound ad valorem, under the
first section of the act of June 30, 1864 (13 Stat. 202). The
importers claimed it to be dutiable as "chocolate," under
the first section of the act of June 6, 1872 (17 id. 231), which
imposes a duty of five cents per pound.
The case was tried by the court below, without the intervention of a jury; and, by an agreed statement of facts, it was
admitted that the chocolate was in boxes containing thirty-six
little bricks, done up in separate papers, each box weighing
about half a pound; and that the chocolate, being such as is
ordinarily sold by confectioners as confectionery, and by the
box or package, was valued at over thirty cents per pound. It
was also admitted that chocolate comes in other forms.
Judgment having been rendered in favor of the plaintiffs, the
collector brought the case here.
Hr. Assistant-Attorney- General Smith for the plaintiff in
error.
Mr. Edward Hartley, contra.
MR. JUSTICE, HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
The first section of the act of June 30, 1864, imposes "on
all confectionery not otherwise provided for, made wholly or in
part of sugar, valued at thirty cents per pound or less, a duty
of fifteen cents per pound; on all confectionery valued above
thirty cents per pound, or when sold by the box, package,
or otherwise than by the pound, fifty per cent ad valorem."
13 Stat. 202.
The act of June 6, 1872, imposes a duty of five cents per
pound "on chocolate." 17 id. 231.
The article in question was chocolate simply, but presented
in a form in which it was ordinarily sold as confectionery.
Was it dutiable as confectionery, or as chocolate ?
The case differs from those already decided, in this, that the
last act expressing the legislative will is that which imposes the
lower rate of duty. It is like the others, in this, that it presents
the question whether the articles are dutiable under general

terms which may embrace them, or under that specific language
-which can be applied to nothing else. That the latter is the
rule by -which the duty is fixed is too well settled to require
argument. Reicke v. Smythe, 18 Wall. 162; Hfomer v. The
-Collector,1 id. 486; liovius v. Arthur, 95 U. S. 144.
Should it be admitted, therefore, that chocolate is composed
in part of the same substances that enter into the composition
of ordinary confectionery, it must, nevertheless, stand upon the
customs list as the distinct article so often described in the acts
of Congress by its specific name.
As early as 1792, chocolate, eo nomine, -was subjected to a
-duty of three cents per pound. 1 Stat. 259.
In 1816, the same duty was again imposed upon it. 3 id.
:311.
In 1824, a duty of four cents per pound was imposed upon it
by name. 4 id. 28.
In the Revised Statutes, it is subject to a duty of five cents
per pound. Rev. Stat. p. 478.
Contemporaneously and side by side, all the way down, the
statutes provide for different rates of duty on the varieties of
sugar and on confectionery, as well as on chocolate. Confectionery and chocolate are uniformly recognized as being different articles for the purpose of duties.
In the first paragraph of sect. 8 of the tariff act of 1842
(5 Stat. 558), sugar of various kinds, comfits, sweetmeats, and
confectionery are subject to a duty of twenty-five per cent ad
valorem; in the second paragraph of the same section, a duty
four cents per pound is imposed upon "chocolate."
In the tariff act of 1846 (9 id. 44), " comfits and sweetmeats"
are dutiable at forty per cent; "confectionery" of all kinds,
at thirty per cent; and "chocolate," at twenty per cent.
In the act of 1861, "comfits and sweetmeats" are placed at
thirty per cent; "confectionery of all kinds, not otherwise provided for," at thirty per cent; "chopolate," at twenty per cent.
12 id. 180, 189.
By the act of July, 1870, chocolate is again made dutiable
by name (16 id. 262); and again by the act of June, 1872

(17 id. 231).
In the Revised Statutes, "sugar-candy and confectionery" are

[Sup. Ot.

provided for, as are "comfits, sweetmeats, and preserved fruits ;"
and, separately, "chocolate," at a different rate of duty. Rev.
Stat. pp. 472, 478.
It is quite evident that Congress has at all times intended to
preserve the distinction between these articles, and that the
circuit judge decided correctly when he held that chocolate,
although in the form and of the character described, was not
dutiable as "confectionery" under the act of 1864.
Judgment affirmed.

ARTHUR v. SUSSFIELD.
1. The similitude clause of the act of Aug. 30, 1842 (5Stat. 565), applies only to
non-enumerated articles.
2. In 1872 and 1873, a quantity of spectacles made of glass and steel were imported at New York, upon which the collector of the port, under the third
section of the act of June 30, 1864 (13 Stat. 205), exacted a duty of fortyfive per cent ad valore,. Held, that they were dutiable under the ninth
section of that act, which imposes "on pebbles for spectacles and all manufactures of glass, or of which glass shall be a component material, not otherwise provided for," a duty of forty per cent ad valorem.
ERROR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of New York.
In 1872 and 1873, the plaintiffs, Sussfield, Lorsch, & Co., imported, at New York, a quantity of spectacles made of glass
and steel.
Arthur, the collector, held them to be subject to a duty of
forty-five per cent, under the third section of the act of June 30,
1864, which reads, "On all manufactures of steel, or of which
steel shall be a component part, not otherwise provided for,
forty-five per cent" (13 Stat. 205), and exacted the duty at that
rate.
The importers insisted that the duties were to be chargeable
under the ninth section of the same act, which reads, "On pebbles for spectacles and all manufactures of glass, or of which
glass shall be a component material, not otherwise provided for,
forty per cent." Id. 211.
Having paid the duty under protest, they brought suit to
