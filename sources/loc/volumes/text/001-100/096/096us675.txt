that the holders of them, who presented them for payment at
the several places to which they were directed, had no thought
of selling them, and, in fact, did not sell them, and, therefore,
in law they were paid, and not sold.
I also believe that the attempt of Duncan, Sherman, & Co.
to take up these coupons without paying them was deceptive
and collusive, and was dictated by their interest in concealing
from the public the fact that the railroad company was unable
to meet those payments.

COUNTY OF RAY v. VANSYCLE.
Pursuant to a power conferred in the charter of A., a railroad company, a county
court of Missouri subscribed, in the year 1860, for stock, and agreed to issue
county bonds in payment therefor. Under the authority of an act of the
General Assembly of that State, passed in the year 1864, A., by a vote of a
majority in interest of its stockholders, said county court voting with said
majority, transferred all the assets, rights, and privileges of its charter, and
all the work done thereunder, to a company, B. C. was, under the general
railroad law, organized as a corporation for constructing a railroad which
passed through the county, and an agreement was made, in 1868, between B.,
C., and the county court, by which the subscription was released; and, in consideration of such release, that court subscribed for the same amount of stock
in C., and issued county bonds in payment therefor. The county, by this
arrangement, secured, with increased railroad facilities, a road in all material
respects the same as that desired and originally contemplated; and it received
and still retains the requisite certificates of stock. The county court levied
and collected the tax to pay the interest due on the bonds for the years 1869,
1870, 1871, 1872, and 1873; but, in August of the last-mentioned year, directed
that the payment of the interest thereunder should be withheld. Suit was
brought against the county by a bona fide holder of the coupons, who purchased the same for value before their maturity. Held, 1. That B. acquired
a vested right to demand and receive the bonds of the county, in payment
of the original subscription to A.; and that such right was not defeated or
impaired by the Constitution of Missouri of 1865. 2. That the agreement
made in 1868 is not, as against such holder, subject to the objection that a
majority of the qualified voters of the county had not, at a general or special
election, expressed their assent to the subscription of stock in C. 3. That the
tax-payers are concluded by the act of the county court, and by their own
failure to assert, by appropriate proceedings, their legal rights, if any they eve?
had, to prevent the transfer of the original subscription from one company to
the other.

a period of more than ten years, commencing with the year
1859.
An act of the General Assembly of the State of Missouri,
approved Dec. 5, 1859, and amended Jan. 5, 1860, incorporated
the Missouri River Valley Railroad Company, with power to
construct a railroad from any point on the North Missouri Railroad in Randolph County, by way of Brunswick, in Chariton
County; thence, through Carroll, Ray, Platte, and Clay Counties, to Weston, in Platte County; and authorized the county
court of any county in which any part of such railroad might
be, to subscribe to the stock of the company, invest its funds in
such stock, and raise the funds by tax to be voted by the legal
voters of the county, in such manner as the county court might
prescribe for the purpose of paying such stock. It declared that
the provisions of the general railroad law of Missouri, not inconsistent therewith, should be extended to that company.
The general railroad law of Missouri then in force made it
lawful for the county court of any county to subscribe to the
capital stock of any railroad company duly organized in Missouri, and, for information, to cause an election to be held to
ascertain the sense of the tax-payers of such county as to such
subscription, and as to whether the same should be paid by
issuing county bonds or by taxation. A county, upon its making such subscription, became, like other subscribers to stock,
entitled to the privileges granted, and subject to the liabilities
imposed, by that law, or by the charter of the company to
which such subscription was made. In order to raise funds
to pay the instalments which might be called for from time
to time by the board of directors of such company, it was made
the duty of the county court to issue the bonds of the county,
or levy a special tax upon all property taxable by law for State
and county purposes, &c.
By an act approved March 30, 1860, amendatory to that of
Dec. 5, 1859, and for other purposes, the county courts of Ray
and other counties specifically named were authorized to issue
and deliver the bonds of their respective counties in payment
of any subscription to or purchase of the capital stock of the
Missouri River Valley Railroad Company which such counties
might respectively make; the bonds to be in the sum of not

exceeding $1,000 each bond, having not exceeding ten years to
run before maturity, bearing interest at the rate of eight per
cent per annum, payable annually at the county seat of the
county issuing them, or in the city of St. Louis, as the county
court might prefer.
On the 2d of July, 1860, the Ray county court, by an order
entered upon its records, directed a vote of the people to be
taken on the 13th of August, 1860, on the question whether
the county should take $200,000 of stock in the Missouri River
Valley Railroad Company, upon the following conditions: That
all of said county stock shall be expended on that part of the
railroad in that county; that said subscription shall be payable
in county bonds, to run ten years, bearing interest, to be paid
annually, at the rate of eight per cent; and that no bond shall
be issued or delivered to said company until provision shall be
made for building the railroad to the eastern boundary of the
county.
At an election held, as ordered, one thousand three hundred
and thirty-seven votes were cast in favor of the subscription,
and six hundred and twenty-three votes against it. The records
of the county court state that the vote cast for the subscription
was by "a majority of the people and tax-payers of the county
of Ray." The court appointed agents to subscribe and vote
the stock upon the conditions mentioned in the order. Such
subscription was legally made.
An act of the General Assembly, approved Feb. 10, 1864, the
provisions of which were accepted by the North Missouri Railroad Company, provided that the Chariton and Randolph
Railroad Company and the Missouri River Valley Railroad
Company might, by a vote of a majority of their stockholders
in interest, transfer and assign to the North Missouri Railroad
Company all of their effects, assets, rights, and privileges, under
their charters, and all the work that had been done in the construction of their respective roads. The two companies, when
the authorized transfer by thema made should be accepted by
the North Missouri Railroad Company, were to cease to have
any corporate existence, and to be styled and known thereafter
as the West Branch of the North Missouri Railroad. The act
declared that said west branch should commence at the town

of Moberly, in the county of Randolph, on the North Missouri
Railroad, and extend west along the route adopted by the
Chariton and Randolph Railroad Company, to the city of
Brunswick; thence on or near the survey of theoMissouri Valley
Road to Richmond, in Ray County; and thence, by the most
advantageous and practicable route, to some point on the north
side of the Missouri River, at or below St. Joseph. The act
also provided that all the franchises vested in the Chariton
and Randolph Railroad Company and the Missouri Valley
Railroad should become, by such transfer and acceptance, fully
and completely vested in the North Missouri Railroad Company.
The county court of Ray, at its April term, 1864, appointed
agents to vote two thousand shares of stock in the then
approaching election for directors of the Missouri River Valley
Railroad Company, with instructions also to vote in favor of
transferring and assigning to the North 'Missouri Railroad Coinpany all the effects, assets, rights, and privileges of the Missouri River Valley Railroad Company, and all the work done
upon the Missouri River. Valley Railroad, as provided in the
act of Feb. 10, 1864. The agents thus. appointed reported to
the court, at its July term, 1864, that in accordance with
instructions they had cast the vote of the county. Their
report was approved, and ordered to be filed and recorded.
On the 13th of December, 1866, a written agreement was
made between the North M.issouri Railroad Company and the
county court; which provided, among other things, that the
company, for the consideration of 150,000 to be paid in
the bonds of Ray County, should build, run, and operate its west
branch to the city of Richmond, in that county, by a spur of
said west branch, and complete the connection within ninety
days after the main or straight line of the west branch should
be completed to a point opposite Richmond. It is not necessary
to zet out that agreement. It is sufficient to say that it secured
to the county all the raih'oad facilities which it would have
received had the main line if the west branch passed in the
immediate vicinity of the city of Richmond; and, in consideration of its consenting to accept the building, operating, and
running of said west branch, as thereby provided, and releasing

[Sup. Ct.

the North Missouri Railroad frcm its former obligations, the
latter agreed to release the county from the sum of $50,000 of
the stock theretofore subscribed for the construction of the said
west branch of the North Missouri Railroad. The company
agreed to build and construct the spur branch or connection from the main line "to the said city of Richmond aforesaid, so far as the grading is concerned, when said county of
Ray issues its bonds for the said sum of 8150,000 to said North
Missouri Railroad Company, so that it may be ready for the
iron by the time the said west branch of said North Missouri
reaches a point opposite the said city of Richmond." This
agreement was promptly ratified of record, and signed by the
justices of said court, with the seal of the county affixed. An
order was at the same time made upon the records of the court,
directing that bonds of the county amounting to $150,000 be
issued "according to the orders of the county court of said
county of Ray heretofore made and the stipulations of this
contract."
At the same term of the court an agent was appointed to
vote the county stock at the next election of directors for tho
North Missouri Railroad Company.
In January, 1868, the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad
Company was organized, under the general raihoad law of
Missouri, for the purpose of constructing and operating a railroad through Ray, Clinton, and Buchanan Counties, from a
point on the west branch of the North Missouri Railroad, at
Richmond, by the most practicable route, through Plattsbu,'g,
to the city of St. Joseph.
On the 15th of April, 1868, the North Missouri Railroad
Company authorized its president and executive committee to
make such contracts with the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company, to aid in building the latter road, as might be
consistent with the interest of the former company; and also
"to release the county of Ray from its subscription of 5200,000
to aid in building the west branch of the North Missouri Railroad, upon the condition that this (the North Missouri) company is released from constructing a spur from the west branch
to Richmond; and also upon the further condition, that Ray
County will subscribe $250,000 stock, and secure the same, to

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

be paid towards the building of the St. Louis and St. Joseph
Railroad."
This proposition was submitted to the county court and
rejected. That court, however, on the 19th of May, 1868,
entered of record an order from which the following is an
extract: "In order that said $200,000 may be applied to the
purpose and object of constructing a railroad from the west
branch of the North Missouri Railroad, through the city of
Richmond, in said county of Ray, to St. Joseph, it is, therefore,
ordered by the court that the said sum of $200,000 be, and the
same is hereby, transferred to the St. Louis and St. Joseph
Railroad Company, to be applied in building, constructing, and
operating that portion of the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad
in Ray County, north of the west branch of said North Missouri Railroad, upon the following express conditions," &c.
These conditions provided that the county should be released
in writing from its subscription of $200,000 to the North Missouri Railroad Company; that, upon the filing of such release
in the proper office, the presiding justice should subscribe the
sum of $200,000 as stock in the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company; that bonds for that amount should be issued to
the company, 850,000, when the court was satisfied that five
miles of the road in Ray County, north of the west branch
of the North Missouri Railroad, and beginning at the said
branch, was under contract, and for the building of which the
bonds and their proceeds were to be applied; and $50,000 as
each additional five miles of the road was graded and ready
for the ties, and not then mless the court should be satisfied that all the bonds previously issued had been properly
applied.
In accordance with this order, the North Missouri Railroad
Company, by its president, executed in June, 1868, and filed
for record, its written release to Ray County of the latter's
subscription to it of $200,000; "the consideration of this
release being the entire cancellation of the existing contracta
between the county of Ray and the North Missouri Railroad
Company, and also the subscription by the county of Ray
to the capital stock of the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad
Company.'

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

[Sup. Or.

No election was held at which the citizens of the county
voted in favor of a subscription to the capital stock of the St.
Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company; but, before the court
made the order of May 19, 1868, it received the petition of
from twelve hundred to fourteen hundred citizens of the county,
asking it to transfer its subscription to the St. Louis and St.
Joseph Railroad Company.
At the NIovember term, 1868, of the court, an order was
made and complied with, directing that $50,000 of the county
bonds be issued to the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company; $50,000 more of them were directed by the court, at its
September term, 1869, to be issued; and $50,000 additional, at
its November term, 1869. The last $50,000 of the bonds were
issued in pursuance of an order entered at its February term,
1870. None of them were delivered until after satisfactory
proof had been made of the construction of each five miles of
road, as stipulated in the agreement of the parties. The county
received and still retains the requisite certificates of stock in
payment for which the bonds were issued.
Sect. 14, art. 11, of the Constitution of Missouri ordains
that "the General Assembly shall not authorize any county,
city, or town to become a stockholder in, or to loan its
credit to, any company, association, or corporation, unless twothirds of the qualified voters of such county, city, or town, at
a regular or special. election to be held therein, shall assent
thereto."
In pursuance of that constitutional provision, the General
Assembly, by general statute, declared, that "it shall be lawful
for the county court of any county, the city council of any city,
or the trustees of any incorporated town, to take stock for such
county, city, or town in, or loan the credit thereof to, any railroad company duly organized under this or any other law of
the State; provided, that two-thirds of the qualified voters of
such county, city, or town, at a regular or special election to be
held therein, shall assent to such subscription."
The court below made a special finding, embracing the facts
above set forth, and others stated in the opinion of this court,
and rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The county
thereupon brought the case here by writ of error.

Oct. 1877.]

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

The case was submitted, on behalf of the plaintiff in error,
by H.r. -Francisff. Cockrell, on the brief of 1H. William S.
Everett, who contended that
1. The county court had but a specially delegated authority,
and could not subscribe for corporate stock, so as to bind the
county, except with the assent of two-thirds of the qualified
voters thereof, expressed in the mode prescribed. As no election was held or ordered, at which such voters, or any of them,
had an opportunity of declaring their assent to the county subscription made in the year 1868, for stock in the St. Louis and
St. Joseph Railroad Company, that subscription, and the orders
for the issue of bonds in payment of it, were in manifest violation of the Constitution and the statutes of Missouri, the provisions whereof the plaintiff below was bound to take notice.
2. The county, in resisting a recovery upon the coupons, is
not estopped from showing that the county court, by reason of
the absence of a popular vote, had no jurisdiction in the premises; and that its orders were void, as unauthorized and prohibited acts.
3. The coupons are void in the bands of the plaintiff below,
although he had no actual notice of the facts which establish
their nullity. The records of the county court, in the matter
of the subscription in question, furnish conclusive proof that the
condition precedent to the lawful issue of the bonds had not
been performed.
Mr. John B. Henderson, contra.
MR. JUSTICE HARLA T, after stating the facts, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The first inquiry suggested by the facts set forth in the
special finding is as to the validity of the agreement of 1868,
whereby the county of Ray secured exemption from liability to
the North Missouri Railroad Company, on its original subscription of $200,000, and the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad
Company obtained the bonds of the county for that amount.
This question must be determined in the light of all that oc.
curred in connection with.the efforts made to secure a railroad
through that county.
It appears that, at the election held in the year 1860, more

COUNTY OF RAY v.

VANSYCLE.

[Slip. Ct

than two-thirds of the votes cast in the county were in favor of
a subscription of $200,000 to the capital stock of the Missouri
River Valley Railroad Company, which proposed to construct
a railroad through the county. The only condition which the
voters imposed was, that the stock subscribed under the authority of that election "should be expended on that part of the
railroad in the county of Ray." In obedience to the popular
will, the subscription was made in that year. When, however,
in 1864, that company transferred all its effects, assets, rights,
and privileges to the North Missouri Railroad Company, the
latter became entitled to the benefit of that subscription, and,
in satisfaction thereof, to the bonds of the county, to the amount
of 8200,000. Of the validity of that transfer we have no doubt.
It was authorized by an act of the General Assembly of Missouri, and made with the sanction of the stockholders of the
companies interested, including the county. At the meeting of
stockholders called to consider the question of transfer, the
county was represented by an agent, designated by the county
court, with specific instructions to vote the stock of the county
in favor of such transfer. In appointing that agent, with such
instructions, -the court did not exceed its powers; since, by the
terms of the act of Dec. 5, 1859, under the provisions of which the
original subscription was made, the court was authorized "to
take proper steps to protect the interests" of the county, and
also "to appoint an agent to represent the county, to vote for it,
and to receive its dividends." It seems, therefore, entirely clear
that the North Missouri Railroad Company acquired, prior to
the adoption of the State constitution of 1865, a vested right
to demand and receive the bonds of the county in payment of
its original subscription. This right was not destroyed or
impaired by that constitution. It has been decided by the
Supreme Court of Missouri, that the section of the constitution
of that State relating to municipal subscriptions was "a limitation upon the future power of the legislature, and was not
intr'nded to retroact so as to have any controlling application
to laws in existence when the constitution was adopted."

But the North Missouri Railroad Company, for some unexplained reason, did not proceed in the construction of the contemplated road. Counsel do not, however, claim that its delay
in that regard worked a forfeiture of its right to the bonds of
Ray County, at the time of the organization, in the year 1868,
of the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company. The latter
had in view the construction of a road from some point on the
west branch of the North Missouri Railroad, at Richmond, the
county seat of Ray, to the city of St. Joseph, -in all material
respects, the same road for the construction of which the county
had previously contracted with the North Missouri Railroad
Company. At this crisis, the latter company, having perhaps
a pecuniary interest in establishing a connection between its
west branch and the city of St. Joseph, proposed to release the
county from its subscription of $200,000, if it would subscribe
$250,000 to the capital stock of the St. Louis and St. Joseph
Railroad Company. Declining to assent to that arrangement,
the court, on behalf of the county, made a counter-proposition;
to wit, that, for the purpose of constructing a railroad from the
west branch of the North Missouri Railroad, through Richmond
to St. Joseph, it would transfer the $200,000 subscription to
the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company, by making a
similar subscription to that company, to be applied in building,
constructing, and operating such road, provided the county
was released, in writing and of record, from all liability upon
its original subscription to the North Missouri Railroad Company. This proposition was promptly acceded to by both
companies. The required release was executed and put upon
record; and the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company
entered upon the construction of, and did construct, the proposed road; receiving the bonds of Ray County in sums of
5,50,000, as each five miles of road was completed, and faithfully applying the proceeds to that portion of the road which
was in that county.
We are now asked to declare that the county is under no
legal obligation to pay its bonds, issued and put upon the market under the circumstances we have detailed.

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

[Sup. Ot.

The fundamental proposition underlying the defence is, that,
after the adoption of the Constitution of 1865, no subscription
of stock could be lawfully made by the county until after an
election; and that, no election having been held at which the
people voted specifically in favor of a subscription to the stock
of the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company, the action
of the court was a nullity, creating no liability whatever upon
the bonds issued in pursuance of the agreement of 1868. Whatever weight that proposition might have in some cases, it does
not meet the precise issues here presented. It ignores altogether the direct connection which existed between the agreement
of 1868 and the action taken by the county and its court prior
to the year 1865, whereby the county assumed the obligation
to issue its bonds to the amount of $200,000, in discharge of a
completed subscription to the stock of a corporation which
came into existence and was fully organized before that constitution went into operation, and which could, notwithstanding
the adoption of that instrument, compel the county to comply
with its contract. It is the case of a transfer of such stock by
exchange, in order that the county might obtain the desired
road, and be discharged from legal obligations from which it
could not justly or rightfully escape. It is not the case of an
entirely new subscription, made under the Constitution of
1865, in disregard of its provisions and of the general statutes
passed in pursuance thereof. When the arrangement of 1868
was first suggested, the court saw that the desire of its constituents for the construction of a railroad through the county
was not likely to be fulfilled through the agency of, or under
the contracts previously made with, the North Missouri Railroad
Company. Its members became convinced that the only effectual or practicable mode to accomplish that end was to make such
an arrangement or combination as that made with the new
company. The court was given by the statute, under which
the original subscaiption was made, the power to "take proper
steps to protect the interests of the county;" to which end it
was authorized to appoint an agent "to represent the county,
to vote for it," &c.; and, in exercising this power, it was necessarily invested with very broad discretion. It is not an unreasonable construction of the statute to say that, in determining

Oct. 1877.]

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

-

what steps were proper for the protection of the interests of
the tax-payers, the court had authority to adopt such measures
as prudent men managing the affairs of others ought to have
adopted. It evidently regarded the arrangement made in 1868
as essential to the protection of the county's interests, so far as
they were involved in the subscription of stock previously made,
and in the obligations thereby assumed. There is nothing in
the record upon which to base any imputation of collusion or
bad faith. The action was taken under such circumstances of
publicity as to notify the tax-payers generally of all that was
doing; and we are not prepared to say that the court had not
the power to transfer the subscription from the North Missouri Railroad Company to the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company, and deliver the county bonds to the latter,
upon its agreement to build substantially the same road for
the construction of which the original subscription had been
made.
But whatever doubt exists upon this point should be resolved in favor of the bona fide holders of the bonds. The
tax-payers of the county should not, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, be now heard to allege that their agents,
invested by statute with the authority and charged with the
duty of protecting their interests, had exceeded their powers.
The court levied and collected a tax to pay interest due on the
bonds delivered to the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company for the years 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, and 1878. The
coupons were annually paid for the first four years named. It
is true that, at a term of the court held in August, 1871, an
order was entered of record, stating that the bonds had been
issued illegally and were void, and upon that ground the order
recited that neither the bonds nor the coupons would be paid
by the county. But in March, 1872, that order was rescinded,
and the county treasurer directed to proceed with the payment of the interest. It was not until August, 1878, that the
court finally determined to repudiate all obligations to pay the
bonds; and under its orders the interest collected for 1873 has
been retained. It further appears from the special finding that
the North Missouri Railroad Company constructed its western
branch from Moberly to Kansas City, running through the

COUNTY OF RAY V. VANSYCLE.

[Sup. Ct.

county for a distance of between twenty-six and twenty-eight
miles; that the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad Company constructed its road from opposite Lexington through Richmond,
locating a depot in Richmond, and continuing to the northwest
boundary of said county, a distance of twenty-eight miles; that
said road is completed and operated to the city of St. Joseph,
Missouri; that on the first-named road there are four depots located in Ray County, and on the latter five depots; that the
money realized from the sale of the bonds issued was expended
in the construction of the St. Louis and St. Joseph Railroad, in
the county of Ray, and, in consequence of this arrangement, the
county secured the construction and operation, within its limits,
of about twenty-four miles of railroad more than would have
been built under the previous contract or arrangement with the
North Missouri Railroad Company.
But this is not all. In payment of the county subscription
and bonds, certificates of stock in the St. Louis and St. Joseph
Railroad Company were issued to the county, and are still held
by it. They have never been tendered for cancellation. When
the court declared, in 1873, that the county would pay neither
the principal nor the interest due on the bonds, no intimation
was given of even its willingness to surrender the certificates.
Upon the clearest principles of justice, the tax-payers of Ray
County are concluded by the acts of their official agents, and
by their own failure, either intentionally or from neglect, to
assert, by appropriate proceedings, their legal right (if any they
ever had) to prevent the transfer of their original subscription
to the company, which, by the construction of its road, gave
them greater railroad facilities, and at no greater cost, than
they could have obtained under the contract with the North
Missouri Railroad Company.
Although this case has many features peculiar to it, the con
elusion we have reached is in harmony with settled principles
heretofore announced by this court in numerous cases.
lt seems unnecessary to consider other points suggested in
argument, as the views here expressed are sufficient to dispose
of the case.
Judgment affirmed.
