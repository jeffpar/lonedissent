T/.

It is in the general true that the province of an appel.
late court is only to enquire whether a judgment when
rendered was erroneous or not. But if fubfequent to the
judgient and before the decifion of the appellate court, a
law intervenes and pofitively changes the rule which go-.
verns, the law muff e obeyed, or its obligation denied.
If the law be conflitutional, and of,that no doubt in the
prefcnt cafe has been 'expreflkd, I know of no court
which'can cont~ft its obligation. It is true that in mere
private cafes between individuals, a court will and ought
to firuggle hard againft a conftru&ion which will, by a
retrofpe&ive operation, affe& the rights of parties, but in
great national concerns where individual rights, acquired
by War, are facrificed for national purpofes, the contraa,
making the facrifice, ought always to receive a conftru&ion
conforming to its manifeft import; and if the nation has
given up the vefted rights of its citizens, it is not for the
court, but for the government, to confider whether it be a
cafe proper for compenfation. In fuch a cafe the court
muft decide according to exifling laws, and if it be neceffary to fet afide a judgment, rightful when rendered, but
which cannot be aftiiied but in violation of law, the judgment muff be fet afide.

" neyman, that the faid box of tallow was in the houfe

"of the faid. town, of, and concerning the faid box of
" tallow, who by his warrant, dated the 27 th day of De.
" cember, in the year 1799, called the plaintiff before

acquitted and difcharged by the Laid court, which is the

The plaintiff objeaed to the filing of that plea, in this
ftage of the caufe, and upon argument, the court'on the
13 th day of Oaober, refufed to receive it ; whereupon,
the defendant took a bill of exceptions, and pleaded the
general iffue, upon which, on khe i4 th day of Odober,
there was a verdi&t for the plaintiff, and judgment for
iooo dollars damages.
On that judgment the defendant brought his writ of
error to this court, and the error afligned was the refufal
of the court below to fuffer the defendant to file the fpecial plea above recited.
The caufe was at this term argued by C. Lee for plaintiff in error, and Simms and Mafon for defendant.

The a& of affembly of Virginia, refpeaing the diftriat
courts of that ftate, fec. 28, (revied code, p. 85.) provides, that " every judgment entered in the office againft

" a defendant and vail, or againft a defendant and fherift, fhall be fet afide, if the defendant, at the fucceedi.ing court, fhall be allowed to appear without bail, put
" in good bail, being ruled fo to do, or furrender himfelf
" in cuftody, and fhall plead to iffue immediately." And
in fec. 42, of the fame a&, p. 87, it is further provided,
" That all judgments by default for want of an appearc ance or fpecial bail, or pleas as aforefaid, and non-fuits
"tor difmiffions obtained in the office, and not fet afide
" on fome day of the next fucceeding diftri court, fhall
" be entered by the clerk as of the laft d.cy of the term ;
"which judgment fhall be final in anions of debt found" ed on any fpecialty, bill, or note in writing, afeerc"taining the demand, unlefs the plaintiff ffiall choofe
I in any fuch cafe to have a writ of enquiry of damages;
" and in all other cafes the damages flhall be afcertained
" by a jury, to be empanneled and fworn to enquire
c thereof, as is herein after dlre&ed."
Upon an equitable conftruCtion of thefe feclions of the
a&, the pradtice in Virginia has been to permit the defendant to come in at a fubfequent term and avail himfelf
the fame manner as if
of any fuch defence as he has, ip1
he had pleaded it at the particular term mentioned. This
queftion has been difcuffed in Virginia and received the
conflru&ion for which I contend. The cafe of Doqwnman v. Downman's executors, x. Wafh. 26, was a plea of
tender after office judgment confirmed. In p. 27, the
" court fay, thefe words " plead to ifue immediately," are
" the fame as were ufed in the old a& of 1753, for efta-

c blifhing the general court; under which, the praaice
" of that court was very liberal, in allowing a defendant
4 to plead that which did not make an iffue, but required
fubfequent pleadings, provided the real juftice of the
" cafe, and not intended delay, was thereby promoted.
" This is unavoidable in cafes of bonds with collateral
- conditions, where the defendant cannot plead to iffue.
" This is alfo agreeable to the principle laid down by lord
" Holt, in 2. Salk. 622; " That though a judgment be

cc of the attornies and their clients, who can feldom com-

, .municate with each other but at court, juftice feems to
crequire a relaxation in thefe rules (Englifh rules) of
is pradice. It would feem to me proper to allow a dif- cretion in the judges to admit any plea which appears
- neceffary for the defendant's defence, and only to reS-fort to the rigor of the rule where delay appears to be
- intended." This plea then, if neceffary for the defendant's defence, ought to have been admitted. It contains
nothing exceptionable, and the fadfs flated in it, if true,
are a .juftification. There is no cafe more proper for
fpecial pleading than one in which the prejudices of the
people are enlifted on one fide or the other. The law
only direds what is to be done the firft term, but afterwards it is left open to the difcretipn of the court. In
this cafe there can be no pretence that the plea was intended for delay, as it was offered on the 9 th, and' the
caufe was not tried until the 14 th of Oaober, fo that
there was full time to anfwer the plea and make up the
iffue.
To fhew that this plea is a good juffifcation, I refer
to the cafe of Coxe v. Wirrall, Cro. Jac. 193, where a
fimilar plea was adjudged good upon demurrer.
It is common pradice, even in the Englifh courts, to
permit the general iffue to be withdrawn, and a fpecial
plea filed, where it is not done with an intent of delay.

Lee. I conceive the circuit court at Alexaridria, to be

I will not deny that the courts of Virginia have gone
the length ftated in Wafhington's reports. They have
ufed their difcretion, and have confidered whether the
plea offered tends to.the juftice of the caufe, or whether
it is intended only for delay. In this cafe, the time having
paffed when the defendant could file his plea as a matter
of right, it was entirely in the difcretion of the cotirt to
admit or rejet it.
It is certainly not a fuifficient juftification for the defendant to fay that the magiftrate committed the plaintiff;
for that neither deftroys the evidence of exprefs malice,
nor thews probable ctufe for the profecution. The magiftrate might have committed upon the evidence of the
defendant Refler himfelf; fo that this plea would nfoft
probably have been over-ruled upon 'lemurrer, and at any
rate would have created delay;,for in a matter of fo much
confequence it cannot be prefumed that the counfel for
the plaintiff could at once determine whether to demur or
to join iffue.
The defendant was not precluded from making a proper defence. He might have fhewn probable caufe on the
general iffue, for the gift of th; ation is the want of
probable caufe ; and the court had the power of inftruding the jury whether fuch cau'fe was fhewn or not. Bul.
ler, N. P. 14.
It is faid that the plea was offered in a reafonable time.
It can not furely be faid that three days in the hurry of
the court is a reafonable time to anfwei fuch a plca'-fo
fay the courts of Virginia.
This plea amounts to the general iffue, and therefore
ought not to have been received. The juftice of the cafe
did not require it, and it is only to promote juftice that
the courts have ever deviated from the precife terms.of
the law.

court have only exercifed the fame difcretion which a
Virginia court might have exercifed. There is a particular time allowed for fpecial pleading; after that time,
the admiffion of a plea is difcretionary with the court.
The cafe in Wafhington's reports is clear to fhew that it
is altogether a matter of diferetion. The court might
have refufed to receive any plea at all ; for the right of the
defendant to fet afide the office judgment, by pleading to
iffue, is confined to the court next fucceeding the office
judgment.
, But the defendant had every advantage under the general iffue, which he could have had under his plea. It is
extremely clear that the plaintiff muft (hew malice, and
the defendant, matter of juftification. The rules of practice in the courts of Virginia,,are confined to Virginia.
The courts of the United States are not bound by them.
They have power to make their own rules.
.Lee, in reply.
Our complaint is that the inferior court has not exercifed its difcretion in the manner it ought to do. I ufe
the word dicretion, differently from Mr. Mafqn. The
exercife of fuch difcretion is fubjed to the cofntrol of
this court. If we look to the decifions of the courts in
Virginia, we find that they have foundly exercifed their
difcretionary power. The pra&ice has conftantly been
to let in the parties notwithftanding any laches. Was it
proper in the court to fay, that although we have a right
to fuffer you to bring the queftion of probable caufe before the court, and to take it from the jury, and although
you wifh fo to do, yet we will not permit you, but will
compel you to go before the jury ; where fa&s difclofed,
not pertinent to -he iffUe, might make an improper impreffion ?
Curing, .uflce. Do you admit that the dtfendant
might have given in evidence under the general iffue, the
fads flated iithe plea offered :

It is fufficient for us if it was a matter of doubt.

in fueh a cafe, a cautious pra&itioner will -always take
-the fafeft method, aid plead the fa&s fpecially.

DECEMBER, i8ox.
There is no doubt but the court had a right to make
rules of practice for itfelf. But not having made fuch a
rule in this cafe, its difcretion ought to have been guided
by the pra&ice of the Virginia courts.
We therefore
hope that this court will corre6a the indifereet exercife
of the power of the court below in this cafe.

"TheCourt. It is true that the courts in Virginia have
been very liberal in admitting any plea, at the next term
after an office judgment, which was neceffary to bring
forward the fubftantial merits of the cafe, whether it was
4tri6lly an iffuable plea, or not. But at a fubfequent term,
it is a matter of mere difcretion with the court whether
they will admit any fpecial plea at all.
In the prefent cafe the faas, ftated in the plea offered,
might have been given in evidence on the general iue ;
the court exercifed their difcretion foundly in rejeaing
the plea.
