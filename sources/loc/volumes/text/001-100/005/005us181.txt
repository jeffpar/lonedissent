The queftion then arifes, what was due diligence in this
cafe. As the law flarids in Virginia, Young and co.
ought to have fued Mark Edgar, the maker of the note.
Such is the opinion of Judge Roane, in the cafe of Mackie v. Davis, 2 Wa/.

230, which is confirmed by the

judgment of the court of appeals in the cafe of Lee v.
Love, in i. Call's Reports, 497.

But it is unneceffary to refort to the general law in
Virginia on this point, becaufe the court of Fairfax
county has decided the law in this cafe, and while that
judgment ftands unreverfed it is conclufive. The plaintiffs have made their eledion of two modes of proceeding to recover the money-having failed in one, they are
barred as to the other. The fame evidence is neceffary to
fupport both, and this is the teft to prove that they are
for the fame caufe. 3 Wifon 304. Kitchen v. Campbell.
That court has decided that Clarke was not liable on
his indorfement of the note, becaufe Young and co. had
not brought fuit againft Edgar; or, in other words, they
have decided that Young and co. have not ufed due diligence, and therefore have i nade the note their own; and
if fo, the original contra& for the falt is at ap end. Yet
the court below have decided this very queftion differently.
They have faid that a fuit againft Edgar, was not a neceffary part of due diligence. The fame queftion, between
the fame parties, has been differently decided by the two
courts.

The court below was concluded by the decifion of the
eounty, court of Fairfax. Nenmo his vexari debet. The
plaintiffs below had two modes of recovering their money from Clark, viz. by a fuit for the falt fold, or by an
affion againft Clark on his indorfement of the note.
They made their election of the latter, and it has been
decided againif them. This ought to end the bufinefs.
3 Wi/fn 304. Kitchen v. Campbell.
E. J..Lee, contra.
The queftion feems to turn on the fecond bill of exceptions. It appears by thal, that the note was not given
as an abfolute, but a conditional payment. It is unreafonable to fuppofe tat the condition was that Young and
co. fliould be obliged to profectite a fuit againft Edgar
through all the courts of Virginia.
The prayer was to inftrua the jury that a fuit muft be
proved to have been profecuted againil Edgar, and his in-.
folvency made to appear.
The judgment of the county court of Fairfax is no bar.
It'was not even a bar to a fecond fuit by Young and co.
againff Clark on the fame note. 'For the opinion of that
court was not generally that the fuit would not lie againft
Clark on hig indorfemeut, but that it would not lie againft
him previous to a fuit againft Edgar, and his infolvency,
being made to appear. Therefore, after proving Edgar
infolvent by a fuit, Young and co. might have brought a
fecond fuit againft Clark and recovered, for any thing that
appears by. the opinion of that court.
If then Young and co. might have had a fecond a~ion
upon the note, they may well bring a fuit upon their ori-,
ginal caufe of aaion. The opinion of the Fairfax court
was only that the plaintiffs had brought their aaion toe
foon.
It is faid this is the fame caufe of aaion which has been
decided in the county court of Fairfax, and that the judoment in that court is a bar to this a&ion.

In order to prove this, it is neceffary to fhew, not only
that the fame evidence applies to both, but the former
judgment muft have been upon the fame point. And that
point muft be on the merits. 5 Bac. ab. new edition, p,
442.

In the cafe of Kearlake v. Morgan, cited from 5 Term
Rp. it did not appear what had become of the note ; it
might hlave been paid. Befides that was a cafe under the
flatute of Anne, which makes promiffory notes a payment.The cafe of Chamberlyn v. Delarive, in 2
ilfon 3S3,
was decided on he grofs negligence of the plaintiff in
holding the order four months without making a demand
of the money, until the drawee failed.
The refufal of the court below to give the inftru&ion
prayed, and the diredion which they did give.to the jury,
are both juilified by the decifions of the court of appeals
of Virginia. That court has never decided, that a fuit
againft the maker of the note is, in all cafes, neceffary before refort can be had to the indorfer. It is- true that
in the cafe of Alackie v. Davis, Judge Roane faid,'that
" the affignee of a bond acquires a legal right to bring
" fuit upon it, and to receive the money difcharged from
4 any control of the affignor over the fubjed ;" and that
" it is, therefore, his duty to bring fuit." But that -was
only an obiter opinion, not applicable to the point of the
caufe. It is certainly not a felf-evident truth, nor is it
very apparent how the conclufion flows from the premifes; and judge Carrington, in his opinion, in the
fame cafe p. 231, fays " As to the lengths which it be" h6ves the afignee to go in purfuit of the obligor, before
"9 he can refort to the affignor, it is unnecefjary to lay down
4 any general rule; it may fuffice to fay, that in the pred, fent cafe he went far enough." In that cafe, indeed, a
fuit had been brought; but the courts of Virginia have
never laid down any general rule as to what is due diligence in fuch a cafe. In the cafe of Lee v. Love, in
Call'sreports, and Minnis v. Pollard, Call 226. it feems
rather to be inferred that a fuit is not in all cafes neceffary
In the cfe of .ackie v. Davis, the court decided
that the remedy of the affignee of a bond againfi the
affignor, was by the common law ; and it is clear from

FEBRUARY, xcI.

the cafe of Lambert v. Oake,, in i Lord Raymond 443,
that, by the common law, the indorfee of a note had his
remedy againft the indorfer, if the money .was not paid
by the maker of the note on demand.
If, therefore, a fuit againft the maker of a note is not,
in all cafes, neceffary'to charge the indorfer, the court
below were right, both in refufing the inftrufion as prayed, and giving the opinion which they did.
C. Lee, on the fame fide.
i. The point arifing from the firit bill of exceptions is,
that the court might well iefufe to compel the plaintiffs
below to join in demurrer to the evidence. This point
being now agreed, I fhall confider,
2. Whether the court did right in refutfing the inftruction t6 the jury, as prayed in the fecond bill of exceptions,

It is not neceffary to enquire whether the inftru&ion
which they did give was right, but whether they were
bound to give that which was afked.
If the note was not received at the time, as abfolute
payment for the falt, Young and co. had a right of
adion for the price of the falt, upon demand and refufal
of payment of the note by Edgar. The liability of the
indorfer to the indorfee of a note is at common law,
and not by the cuftom of merchants, or the ftatute of
Anne. And by the common law, nothing more was neceffary to fix that liability than a demand upon. the maker
of the note and his refufal to pay. Upon this, and this
only, the right of aftion accrued againft the indorfer.
It is true that Young and co. had two remedies. They
might either fue Clark upon his indorfement, or upon the
original contrat for the falt. Having failed in the former, they are not precluded from reforting to the latter.
Their elecion of the firit is not a waiver of the laft.
The affion in Fairfax county, on the note, was no bar
to the aCtion in the diftriC& of Columbia, upon the account. The note was no payment of the account, nor

In the prefent adion the declaration has alfo three
counts.--.tL for the price'of the falt fold ; 2d. a quantun valcbat ; 3 d. money had and received.
The fame evidence will not fupport both actions. The
indorfement of Clark is the evidence neceffary in one.
The delivery of the falt is the evidence to fupport the
other.
In the cafe of Kitchlin v. Campbell, 2 BI. Rep. 827, 831,

yet it was held to be no bar.
The cafe of Keamflake v. Morgan depends on the flatute of Anne, which declares that a note given for a debt

If a note is agreed to be taken in payment ab folutely,
it is a fatisfa&ion ; but where there is no fuch agreement,
the law implies a condition that the holder fhaU ufe due
diligence. The county court of Fairfax has decided that
Young and co. have not ufed due diligence. That de-

cifion is valid and conclufive all over the world, until
reverfed by a competent authotity.
How then does
this cafe ftand ? Young and co. fold falt to Clark, and

received a note, as a conditional payment, or a collateral
fecurity, no matter which; which note they have made
their own by their own laches. The maker of the note
'has become infolvent and run away. Who ought to bear
the loft ? The law fays clearly, the perfon who his been
negligent, who has .not complied with the requifites of
the law.
It is immaterial whether the judgment in Fairfax, is an
abfolute or a temporary bar ; "for if it is a temporary bar
only, yet Young and co. have not done what that court

,decided to be neceffary.
Mafon, on the fame fide.

A judgment on the fame queftion between the fame
parties is conclufive until reverfed. What is the fame
queftion ? It is the real merits, the matter of right between the parties.

The fame evidence is not the criterion. Trefpafs ap&
trover require different evidence; yet if the merits of
the fame queftion are the gift of both, the one is a bar
to the other. Here the queftion was the fame as in Fairfax, viz. Whether Young and co. had not been guilty,
of laches in refpe& to the note, for if they had, they
had barred themfelves not only from a right to recover
upon the note, but upon the original contra& for the
falt. One and the fame queftion will decide both cafes.
That queftion is upon the merits, and is in h& the only
queftion in difpute between the parties.
It is not important whether the note was rece'ved -as

an abfolute or a conditional payment.

For if it was a

Youva

conditional payment, the laches of Young and co. have
made it abfolute. There is no evidence of notice to
Clark, of the ddault of Edgar, until the bringingof the
fuit in Fairfax county, which was t8 months after the
note became payable. Having two remedies for the price
of the falt, Young and co. could not refort to both.
They made their ele&ion to fue upon the note, and having purfued that remedy to judgment againft themfelves,
they are forever barred.
The county court of Fairfax have decided the only
queftion which exifted between the parties, the negligence of the plaintiffs below, whereby they had made
the note their own; and therefore they muft abide the

The chief j]ice delivered the opinion of

This was a fuit brought by the defendants in error
againft the plaintiffs, inthe circuit court of the diftri&
of Columbia fitting in the county of Alexandria, and the
declaration contains two counts for goods, wares and
merchandizes fold-and delivered, and one for money had
and received to their ufe. The caufe came on to be tried
on the general iffue and a verdi&l was found for the plaintiffs below, on which the court rendered judgment.
At the trial of the caufe it appeared that the fuit was
brought for a quantity of falt fold and delivered by Robert
Young and co. to Clark ; after which Clark indorfed to
Robert Young and co. a promiffory note made by Mark
Edgar to John Pickerfgill and co. which had been indorfed
by them to the faid Clark, and which was payable 6o days
after date.
This note was protefted for non-payment; after which
a fuitwas brought thereon by Robert Young and co. in the
county court of Fairfax againft Clark ; and the declaration
contained two counts, one on the indorfement, and the
other for money had and received to the ufe of the plaintiffs. In this fuit verdift and judgment was given for the
defendant Clark, the court of Fairfax being of opinion
tliat' a fuit qould not be maintained againft the indorfer

FEBRUARY,

of the note, until a judgment had been firft obtained
againft the drawer, and his infolven-i made to .ppear.
Afte- the determinati5n of that a&ion, this fuit was
inftituted on the original contra& ; and, at the trial, the
counfel for the defendant moved the court to inftru&
the jury, that if from the evidence given in the caufe,
they thould be of opinion that the promiffory note aforefaid was indorfed by the defendant to the plaintiffs, in
confequence of thegoods, wares.ahd merchandizes fold as
aforefaid, although the faid indorfement was not intended as an'abfolute payment for the faid goods, wares and
merchandizes, or received as fuch by the plaintiffs, but
merely as a conditional payment thereof, yet the receipt
of the faid note under fuch circumftances, and the inftitution of the aforefaid fuit by the faid plaintiffs againft
the faid defendant, on his indorfement aforefaid, made the
faid note, fo far a payment to the faid plaintiffs, for the
faid goods, wares and merchandizes, as to preclude them
from fuftaining any affion againft the faid defendant for
the faid goods, wares and merchandizes, until they had
taken fuch meafures again ft the faid Mark Edgar, as were
required by the' laws of Virginia; and that the plaintiffs,
having initituted the fuit afo refaid upon the faid note
againft the faid defendant, and that having been decided
againft the faid plaintiffs, they were barred from fuftain.
ing this aaion againft the faid defendant.
This inftruaion the court refufed bo give, but dire&ed
the jury, that if they were of opinion, from the evidence,
that the falt was fold and delivered as alleged,-'and that the
promiffory note aforefaid was indorfed by the defendant to
the plaintiffs in confequence of the falt fold as aforef-id,
although the faid indorfement was not intended as an
abfolute payment for the faid falt or received as fuch by
the plaintiffs, but merely as a conditional payment thereof,
the fame is a difcharge to the defendant for the falt fld
to him, unlefs it is proved that due diligence has been
ufed to receive the money due on the note ; but that the
bringing fuit on the faid note againit Mark Edgar was not
effentially neceffary to conftitute the faid diligence ; and
that the faid diligence may be proved by other ciecumftances, and their omitting to bring the faid fuit again(I

if proved, or any condua of the defendant which may
have prevented the bringing of the faid fuit.

YoUNG

& Co.

To this opinion the counfel for the defendant excepted,
and then prayed the court to dire&t the, jury that the defendant was entitled to a credit for the amount of the faid
note, unlefs the plaintiffs could fhew that they had inftituted a fuit thereon againft Edgar, or that Edgar had
taken the oath of infolvency, or abfconded at the time
th aote became payable, or unlefs the plaintifl could
fh1hw that they had offered to return and re-affign the faid
note to the faid defendant, previous to the inftitution of
this fuit.
This direffion the court refufed to give, and referred
the jury to their opinion already given on the principal
points now Qated and to which an exception had already
been taken. This opinion was alfo excepted to. A verdi&t and judgment was then rendered for the plaintiff without giving credit for Edgar's note, which judgment is now
brought into this court by writ of error.
On thefe exceptions it has been argued that the court
1has erred, becaufe,
ilf. The condu&t of the plaintiffs, Young and co. has
difabled them from maintaining this affion, and fuch
ought to have been the dire&tfon to the jury.
2ly. The verdi&t and judgment in Fairfax court is a
bar to this ation.
The condu6t of the plaintiffs was entirely before the
jury, to be judged of by them from the evidence, excepting only that part of it refpe&ing which the court
gave an opinion. We are therefore only to enquire whether the opinion given by the court be erroneous.
It is agreed on both ides that the note in this cafe was
not received, as payment of the debt, and confequently
did not extinguifh the original contra&t. It was received
as a conditional payment only, and the opinion 'of the
court was, that in fuch a cafe the want of due diligence
to receive the money due thereon would difcharge the
defendant. But the court proceeded to Rtate that due

FEBRUARY, 1803.
diligence might be proved although no fuit was inftituted;
and that circumftances, fuch as the known infolvency of
Edgar, the drawer of the note, or ary condu& of Clark,
preventing a fuit, would excufe Young and co. for not
having inftituted one.
This opinion of the court feems perfe&ly corre&. The
condition annexed to the receipt of the note can not be
prefumed to have required that a fuit fhould be )rought
againft a known infolvent, or that it fhould be brought
againft the will of the indorfer; if he chofe to difpenfe
with it, or took means to prevent it, nothing can be more
unreafonable than that he ihould be at liberty to avail himfelf of a circumftance occafioned by his own condut.
It is riot intended to fay that the perfon receiving fuch
a note is compellable, without fpecial agreement, to fie
upon it in any ftate of things. It is not defigned to fay
that he may riot, on its being protefted, return it to the
indorfer, and refort to his original caufe of aaion ; it is
only defigned to fay, that under the circumftances of this
cafe, nothing can be more clear than that there was no
obligation to fue.
The court gave no opinion that the fuit in Fairfax was,
or was not, a bar to that brought in the county of Alexandria.
It is however clear that no fuch bar was created.
To wave the queftion, whether in fuch a cafe as this,
with declarations for fuch diftin&t caufes, a verdi& in a
prior fuit may be given in evidence as a bar to another fuit
really for the fame caufe of a6tion: it is perfeffly clear
that in this cafe the fame queftion was not tried in both
caufes.
In Fairfax the point decided was, that the 'uit againft
the indorfer would not lie 'till a fuit had been brought
againft the drawer; in the fuit in Alexandria the point
to be decided was whether the plaintiffs had loft their remnedy on the original contra&, by their condu&t refpecting
the note. Thefe were diftin&t points, and the merits of

On the fecond bill of exceptions, the only real new
point made, is, whether, the aion is maintainable un-

lefs Robert Young and co. had offered to return and reafiign the note before the inflitution of the fuit.
Unqueftionably 'Clark is entitled to the benefit of the
note, but as it was no extinguifhment of the original
caufe of a&ion, there was no abfolute neceffity to prove
an offer of the note before the inftitution of the fuit.
Indeed it does not appear, in this bill of, exceptions, whether the note wa6 merely a collateral fecurity, or a conditional payment. This is'no where ftated pofitively. In
the firft opinion of the court it is ftated hypothetically,
and that opihion muft be confidered on the prefumptiort
that fuch was the faft. But no fuch prefumption is raifed
refpe&fing the fecond bill.
