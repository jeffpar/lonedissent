The evidence offered and admitted to fupport the deelaration was a promiffory note made by Vincent Gray,
dated at Alexandria on the 2d of March 1798, by which
he promifed to pay~fixty days after date to the order of
Mandeville and Jamefon ISoo dollars for value received,
negotiable at the bank of Alexandaia. 'This note was
indorfed by Mandeville and Jamefon to James M'Clenachan, and by him to Jofeph. Riddle and co. the defendants in error. The proteft of. a notary public made on
the fifth May 1798, attefting that lie had on that day
demanded payment of the note of the maker, who refufed, and of Mandeville and Jamefon the firft indorfers,
who alfo refufed, and that James M'Clenachan the other

infolvent debtor and was difcharged, on the 6th of February 1799.
The prefent afion was commenced in July x8os.
A bill of exceptions was taken by the defendants below,

id. There being only one count in the declaration, and
that being only for money had and received, the note
ought not to have been given in evidence, becaufe it muft
have been a furprife to the defendants. In England it is
ufual to give notice of the plaintiffs real ground of alftion
either by a fpecial count, or by a formal notice. - The defendants could not come prepared to defend the adion.
'The a&'ron for money had and received is faid to be in the
nature of a fuit in equity. But here the defendants
were in a worfe fit~uation, than if a bill in chancery had
been filed againft them ; for in that cafe the bill muft
have ftafed the grounds of the claim and fhown the equitable circumftances which entitled the plaintiffs to recover.
A remote indorfer is liable to the holder only upon the
cuftom of merchants, and therefore there ought to have
been a fpecial count ftating the cuftom.
The Englifh ftatute of Anne refpeCaing promiffory
notes is not in force in Virginia; and the act of aflembly
which fupplies its place only allows an affignee to bring
an adion of debt in his own name againft the maker of
the note, but gives no remedy againft the affignors. Hence
it refults that the remedy of*the affignee againft the affignors is either at common law or under the cuftom of
merchants. By the common law the adion of indebitatu,
a/rnpft lies only between privies; and here is no privity.
And if refort be hadto the cuftom of merchants; that cuftom muft be averred in the declaration.

Hey/in v. Adainfon. He uidertakes to pay the fum mentioned in the note, if the original maker does not. As
foon as the, original maker fails, to comply with his engagement, that of the indorfer becomes abfolute. He
then-becomes the holder of fo much money as is expreffed
in the note, to the iife of hi immediate indorfee, or of fuch
perfon as he fhall name.
It is true the plaintiffs below have fought their remedy
at common law ; and by. commori law they are entitled to.
recover. Every man ought to be compelled to pay money
which he has in his hands belonging to another, and which
in equity and good confcience he has no right to retain,
And the principle is now well eftablifhed that at common
law he may be compelled to pay it, by an aaion for money
-had and received.
As to theevidence, offered on this count, it was long
doubted, before the ftatute of Anne -whether any other
.than an aaion of indebitatus afumpfit for money had and
received, or for money lent, would lay upon a note. This
was the ground of contention between lord Holt and the
merchants of" Lombard ftreet; he ftrenuoufly contending
that the alion for money had and received, or for money
lent, was the'only proper remedy; and.they endeavodifig
to bring into ufe the form of declaring upon a note as a
fpecialty. Although a.note may now, under the flatute,
be declared upon as a foefialty, yet the ftatute has not
taken away the common law remedy which exifted before.
As tofurprize, the objefion made would go to almoft
every cafe where money had and received is the proper
aafion, fuch as where the confideration happens to fail,
or where money has been paid.by miftake, &c.
Indorfement is evidence that the indoifer has received
money of the indorfee. And at and from the time of the
indorfement, the indorfer is debtor to the indorfee, and
he debt may be proved under a commiffion of bankruptcy
againft the indorfer before the note is payable.
In this cafe however there could be no furprize, the
defendants below had notice of the non-payment of the
note and that they would be held liable; and it is imma-

Doug. 138, Lo1g

In the cafe of Grant v. Vaughan, 3. Bur. 15 16, the cafes upon promiffory notes before the ftatute of Anne are
taken up and confidered witl great clearnefs and ability
by the court. Every principle eftablifhed in that cafe
furnifhes an argument for the original plaintiffs in this.
The cafe there was, that Vaughan drew a check or order
on his banker in thefe words (" payjbip Fortune or bearer
SC.7o.") and gave-it to Bicknell, who loft it. It was
found by fome perfon, and honeftly taken in payment for
goods by the plaintiff, in his way of trade as a mercer.
Payment of the check being ftopped at the bankers, the
plaintiff brought fuit againft Vaughan the drawer, and
declared upon an inland bill, and for money had and received to his ufe. It was held that thefe notes are, by
law, negotiable and wereJo before the jiatute of A4nne, and
that the bearer of them might maintain an a&ion as bearer,
where he could entitle himfelf to them on a valuable confideration, and for this wyas cited Hinton's cafe, 2 Shower
235, in the reign of Charles 2d.

And Yates, juftice, faid'" Nothing can be more peculi" arly negotiable than a draught or bill payable to bearer ;

The original advancer of "the

tained before the ftatute of Anne ; and that fuch a&ions
did not depend upon theprivity of contraa. There certainly is not more privity of contrad between the drawer
of a note, and the bearer, (efpecially after that note has
been loft by the lawful owner, and comes to the hands
of the plaintiff through thefinder) than between the'maker of a note payable to order, and the indorfee
It alfo
thows, that there are certair, inftruments, which are'negotiable in their own nature by force of the.contra,'?itfeyf, independent of ffatute law; and that a promifee may ag well
be defcribed by being the bearer of a certain paper, as by
being named *ith his chriftian and furname. And if he
may be defignated by the fac of being the bearer of a
paper, there is no reafon why he may not equally be defcribed by the fad of his being the nominee of a certain
other perfon, and the holder of a certain note.
There is no doubt that before the ftitute of Anne notes
were paffed from one to another, and adions for mo'ney
had and received were, on common law principles, maintaijied by the bearers and indorfees. The indorfement
was confidered as conveying or affigning the money of the
payee in the hands of the maker ; and the original contrad of the maker was, to hold the money to the ufe of
the payee or of fuch perfon as he fhould appoint. Privity
of contrad is not the ground of the adion for money.had
and received. And among the many cafes of that kind,
.there will be fcarcely found one in which fuch a privity
has exifted. If I lofe money, I may have this a&ion againft
the finder. If A. delivers money to B. to be paid over to
C. the latter may maintain this a&ion againif B. If a
man, under pretence of authority from me, receive money
due to me, I may recover it of himin this form of adion.
So if I pay money to another by miftake. So if a man
obtains money from me by fraud and deceit. So if the confleration of a bargain fail. So if one pretending to a
right to an office receive fees, the 'rightful officer may,
by an a6tion for money had and received, recover of him
the amount of fees fo received.
The. indorfer is a new drawer as to all the fubfequent
parties. He has received Money from his indorfee which
he engages to hold to his ufe, or to the ufe of fuch perfon as he fhall appoint, in cafe the maker *does not pay

both in form and fubftance. The indorfer orders the
maker to pay to the indorfee, or his order, the fum of money mentioned in the note. The maker by figning the note
acknowledges that he has effeds of the payee, to the
amount of the note, in his hands; and by makinig the
note. payable to the order. of the payee, he authorizes
the payee to draw upon him for that amount, andcpledges
himfelf to honour the draft.. An acceptance may be.
made before the bill is iffued, and is equally binding as if
made after. Kyd. 48. 49. Fhe fignature of the maker
to'the note is an acceptance of the: payee's bill. No part
.or circumfiance of a bill of exchange is wanting.
The plaintiffs' below therefore were clearly entitled to
recover the money from the defendants; and therefore
the 'defendants ought not in juftice and good faith 'to
withhold it. In fuch a cafe there never has been a doubt
but that the bill may be given in evidence on the count
for money had and received.

Swann in reply.
If the ind'orfer is liable, it muft be under the a6d of
affembly. But the ad of affembly gives an action only
againft the maker, as is evident from the provifion for
allowing all juft difcounts, not onl againft the holder
but againft his affignor bc'Fore notice. No cafe can be
found of an affion for moncv had and received brought
by an indorfee againft a remote indorfer, either before the.

,,The a& of the Virginia affembly which makes notes

"In the language of the books, there is a privity be"tween the aflignor and his immediate affignee; but no
