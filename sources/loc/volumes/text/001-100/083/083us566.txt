to the parol agreement. The plaintiffs then proved that,
after the maturity of the note, Specht, with a full knowledge
of the defective demand and notice, promised to pay the
note. No objection was made to the admission of this testimony, nor to the charge of the court upon the subject.
The jury found for the plaintiffs and judgment was rendered
accordingly.
The error complained of is, that the court withdrew from
the jury the evidence touching the parol agreement as to
the place of payment made contemporaneously with the
drawing and execution of the note. The plaintiff in error
insists that, being a surety, it altered and discharged his
contract.
The evidence was improperly admitted and was properly
withdrawn. The agreement was a nullity and could not in
any wise affect the rights of either of the parties. "It is a
firmly settled principle that parol evidence of an oral agreement alleged to have been made at the time of the drawing,
making, or indorsing of a bill or note, cannot be permitted
to vary, qualify, or contradict, to add to or subtract from
the absolute terms of the written contract."* An agreement between the creditor and principal must, to exonerate
the surety, be one "binding in law upon the parties."t

sued for damages.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for Minnesota; the case being
thus:
The city of St. Paul, desiring to have water-pipes laid
along the streets of the city, passed an ordinance authorizing the St. Paul Water Company, an incorporated company,
so to lay them. But as it was necessary that large excavations of the earth should be made along the streets, and
considerable blasting of rock below, the ordinance in one
of its sections, the 6th, thus provided:
"The said water company expressly agrees to protect all persons against damages by reason of excavations made by them
in the said city, in laying pipes, and to keep the said excavations properly guarded-by day and night, and to become responsible for all damages which may occur by reason of the neglect of
their employ~s in the premises, and that the streets and highways

in said city shall not be unnecessarily obstructed or incumbered
in laying said pipes."
The water company accepted the, ordinance. It did not,
however, do any work itself or by its own servants, but
made a contract in writing with one Gilfillan to do th6
work for them. Under this contract, Gilfillan himself superintending the work every day, certain excavations, drillings,
and blastings were made in different streets of the city.
While these operations were going, on in one of the
streets, a certain Ware, driving his horse and wagon in it,
was much injured, owing to his horse taking fright at a
steam-drill in the street, put there to drill the rocks that it
was necessary to remove, and suddenly and without notice
set in motion. He accordingly sued the company for damages.
His witnesses having given evidence tending to show that
the accident was owing to the fact that the excavations were
not "properly guarded" and that the highways were "unnec-

essarily obstructed and incumbered," disclosed in cross-examination the fact above mentioned, to wit, that the company
did not do any work itself or by its servants, but that it had
farmed out its engagement to lay the pipes, and that all
that had happened, had happened while the contractor was
thus in the discharge of his contract.
Thereupon (the plaintiff resting) the defendant asked the
court
"To direct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant,
without requiring the defendant to enter upon a defence, upon
the ground that the negligence, if any, found as the cause of
injury to plaintiff, was the negligence of the servants and employds of said contractor, and not of the defendant or any of its
servants and employds."
This motion the court denied, saying:
"The action is brought upon the principle which is settled, at
least in the Federal courts, that when a person (company or
corporation included) is engaged in a work, in the ordinary
,doing of which a nuisance necessarily occurs, the person is liable for any injury that may result to third parties from carelessness or negligence, though the work may be done by a contractor, and although the plaintiff might have sustained an
action against the city of St. Paul, it is his right to seek his
remedy against the party who created the nuisance."
The defendant then gave evidence to show that the plaintiff had been driving carelessly, and, the case being rested,
asked the court to charge"1. That under the evidence in the case they must find a
verdict for the defendant.
"2. That if the injury complained of was caused solely bythe
negligence or misconduct in the manner of doing the work of
the employds of the contractor, then the defendant is entitled
to a verdict."
The court refused to give either charge, and the defendant excepted. Verdict and judgment having been given for
the plaintiff, $2200, the defendant brought the case here.

Argument for the party injured.

Mr. W. H. Peckham,for the plaintiff in error:
The court below proceeded upon the theory either that
under the contract between the water company and its
contractor, the persons employed by the contractor to do
the work, were the servants of the company, and that the
company was therefore liable for their misconduct or negligence; or that having caused the work to be done, it was
liable for such misconduct or negligence, though the relation of master and servants did not exist between it and the
persons doing the work.
But the legal relation of master and servants did not
exist between the water company and the persons in charge
of the machinery and doing the work. They were in the
employ of the contractor. He was exercising an independent employment, and was their superior.* A party is not
liable for the misconduct or negligent acts of the employes
of one to whom he lets a job of work to be done by contract.
This is settled by the New York case of Blake v. Ferris,t
and by other cases.1
Mr. A. Lamprey, contra:
The case of Storrs v. The City of UticaÂ§ is in point, and the
reasoning of the court seems particularly applicable to this
case. Blake v. -Ferris,cited on the other side, is ieviewed,
and the doctrine that the city is not liable for injuries
caused by negligence in the improvement of streets, because
it has employed a contractor to do the work, is distinctly
overruled.
But we need not enter on any discussion whatever of
that formerly vexed question. Such a discussion is wholly
unnecessary, and in view of other grounds on which the

court below doubtless rested its views--grounds alike obvious and impregnable-such a discussion might be called
irrelative.
The effect of section six of the ordinance, which is both
an agreement with the public and a law, is to make the
water company liable, when injury results from negligence
of an employS, whether such employe is a contractor or
workman.
The company agrees to protect all persons
against damages by means of excavations; to keep the excavations properly guarded; to become responsible for all
damages; and not to unnecessarily obstruct the streets. It
cannot rid itself from the primary liability imposed by this
ordinance, by letting the work to a contractor. The liability exists, no matter how the work is done. The contractor is an employe of the company within the meaning
of this section.
Reply: 1. The ordinance was intended solely for the indemnity of the city, and one not a party to it can derive no
rights under it.
2. The water company, under the ordinance, did not
agree to become responsible for the misconduct of the persons doing the work, but only for damages "by reason of excavations," and "to keep such excavations properly guarded," and
to become responsible for all damages which might occur
"by reason of the neglect of their eraployds in the premises ;" that
is, by reason of the neglect of its employ6s to keep its excavations properly guarded. The object of the provision was
to bind the company to do, in respect to the public streets,
what, as between the city and the public, would be primarily
the duty of the city to do. The only change it made between the city and the company was to give to the city a
contract right to hold the company for any damages it might
be compelled to pay, by reason of the existence of the excavations in the street.

tiff through an obstruction in one of the public streets of
the city of St. Paul, occasioned, as he alleges, by an em.
ploy6 of the corporation defendants, for whose acts they are
responsible, and he instituted the present suit to recover
compensation for those injuries. Service was made, and the
defendants appeared, and the parties went to trial, and the
verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff; and the defendants excepted and sued out this writ of error.
Evidence was introduced by the plaintiff tending to show
that where the accident occurred was a public street of the
city; that the defendants entered into an engagement with
the authorities of the city to make the necessary excavations
in the streets, and to lay therein suitable pipes and complete
the work as stipulated in a certain contract, to introduce a
supply of water into the city for the use of the inhabitants,
and that their employ6 or contractor was at work at the
time making the excavations and laying the pipes; that the
excavations in the street where the plaintiff was injured extended from the intersection of Eighth Street to the intersection of Ninth Street, and that the excavation with the
embankments made on the sides of the same by throwing
out the earth, occupied the greater part of the width of the
street, leaving on the east side little more than a passageway of sufficient width for a one-horse carriage; that in
making the excavation the workmen found it necessary to
drill and blast, employing the steam drill for drilling, and
blasting, as usual, with gunpowder; that the engine which
-propelled the drill was three feet in diameter and was elevated six or seven feet above the surface of the ground, and
at the time of the accident to the plaintiff it stood near the
intersection of Eighth Street with the street in which the
plaintiff was passing; that the plaintiff, with one other person, was riding in a carriage drawn by one horse, and having
turned from Ninth Street into the street where the accident
occurred, the plaintiff, with the other person in the carriage,
was driving along down the narrow passageway, on the east
side of the street, when the persons in charge of the engine
suddenly, and without giving any notice or warning of their

intention, set the engine and drill in operation, causing a
loud noise which frightened the plaintiff's horse and caused
him to shy and turn upon the sidewalk, overturning the carriage and injured the plaintiff
Due care, it is alleged, was used by the plaintiff, as when
he left the intersecting street and passed into the street
where the accident occurred the engine and drill were not
in operation, nor was there any barricade or signal of any
kind to indicate that there was any danger, or that any special precaution was necessary except what was suggested by
the embankment and the narrowness of the street; and the
evidence also tended to prove that neither the engine nor
the drill was seen by the plaintiff or by the person in the
carriage with him until the horse of the plaintiff was within
ten feet of the place where the engine and drill were situated, and that it was at that moment that they were put in
operation by those in charge of the work, and that one of
the workmen ran into the street and threw up his arms as
if to stop the horse, which had the effect to make him still
more unmanageable.
Having introduced evidence tending to prove the foregoing facts the plaintiff rested, and the defendants moved
the court to direct the jury to return a verdict in their favor
upon the ground that the negligence proved, if any, as the
cause of the injury to the plaintiff was the negligence of the
contractor in charge of the work, or his servants or employ~s, and not of the defendants, or their servants or employ~s, which motion the court then and there denied, and
remarked that "the action is brought upon the principle,
which is well settled in the Federal courts, that where a person or corporation is engaged in a work in the ordinary doing
of which a nuisance necessarily occurs, the party is liable
for any injury that may result to third parties from carelessness or negligence, even though the work may be done by
a contractor," and it makes no difference even if the party,
in a case like the present, might sustain an action against
the municipal corporation, as it is his right to seek his remedy against the party who created the nuisance or his im-

ants then and there
Testimony was then introduced by the defendants tending
to show that the injury mentioned in the declaration was not
caused by any neglect or misconduct of the persons in charge
of the work, but wholly by the reckless and negligent driving of the plaintiff, and the person with him in the carriage.
Prayers for instruction to the jury were presented by the
defendants in substance and effect as follows:
(1.) That the court instruct the jury that upon the whole
evidence they must find their verdict for the defendants.
(2.) That if the injttry to the plaintiff was caused solely
by the negligence or misconduct of the employ~s of the contractor in doing the work, then the defendants are not liable.
Both of those requests were refused, and the rulings of
the court in that behalf, together with the refusal of the
court at the close of the plaintiff's case to direct a verdict
for the defendants, present the principal questions in the
case for the decision of the court. Other prayers for instruction, involving the same principles, were also presented by
the defendants, which were also refused, and the rulings are
embraced in the exceptions.
Cities and towns are usually required by statute to keep
their streets and highways safe and convenient for travellers,
and if they neglect so to do, in a case where that duty is
imposed by law, and suffer the same to get out of repair
and defective, and any person as a traveller receives injury
through such defect, either to his person or property, the
delinquent corporation is responsible in damages to the injured party. Such a party, however, cannot maintain an
action against the corporation grounded solely on the defect
and want of repair in the highway, but he must also allege
and prove that the corporation had notice of the defect or
want of repair and that he was injured, either in person or
property, in consequence of the unsafe and inconvenient
state of the highway, as the duty to repair in such cases is
a duty owed to the public, and consequently if one person

WATER COMPANY V. WARE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

might sue for his proportion of the damages for the nonperformance of the duty, then every other member of the
community would have the same right of action, which
would be ruinous to the corporation, and for that reason it
was held at common law, that no action founded merely on
the neglect to repair would lie.*
Nor will an action lie in such a case at the present time;
but it is settled law, by the highest authority of the country
from which the common law is derived, that where it appears that the corporation is under a legal obligation to repair the way in question, and that such obligation is a matter
of general and public concern, and also that the place in
question is out of repair and that the plaintiff has sustained
some peculiar damage in his person or property by means
of such defect or want of repair, that the corporation, if the
means of performing the duty to make the repairs are within
their control, is liable to compensate the injured party for
the injury which he suffered from their neglect.t Since the
decision in Mayor of Lyme-Regis v. H7enley, the case last referred to, many decisions to the same effect have been made
by the State courts in this country approving that rule and
applying it in all similar controversies.1
Grant all that and still the defendants deny that the rule
established by those authorities furnishes any support to the
rulings of the Circuit Court, as they, the defendants, were
mere contractors to make the excavations and lay the pipes,
and they insist that the persons responsible to the plaintiff,
if any, are the persons whom they employed to do the work
and who were in charge of it at the time the plaintiff was
injured, and they deny that they in any view of the case can
be held answerable for the neglect and carelessness of those

who had contracted with them to make the excavations and
lay the pipes, and who had charge of the engine and steam
drill, the operation of which frightened the horse of the
plaintiff.
Concede that proposition and it would follow that the
rulings in question are incorrect; but the evidence exhibited
in the record shows that the defendants agreed with the
municipal authorities to protect all persons against damages
by reason of the excavations made by them preparatory to
laying the pipes, and to keep the work properly guarded by
day and night, and to be responsible for all damages which
"may occur by reason of neglect of their employes in the
premises," and that the streets should not be unnecessarily
obstructed or incumbered in doing the work. Such an
agreement would not acquit the municipality of an obligation, otherwise attaching, to keep the streets safe and convenient for travellers, but it may well be held that a party
injured through a defect or want of repair in such a street,
occasioned by the neglect or carelessness of such a contractor
in doing the work, or of those for whose acts he is responsible, may, at his election, sue the contractor for redress or
pursue his remedy against the municipality, as it is clear
that the contractor, in case of a recovery against the latter,
would be answerable to the municipality as stipulated in his
agreement. Improvements of the kind, such as making excavations and laying pipes for gas or for sewers, are made
by municipal corporations, under circumstances where the
corporation is immediately responsible for the defect or want
of repair in the street, without any other party being answerable over to thein for any damages they may have to
pay to a traveller who may be injured through such a defect
or want of repair, as where they appoint their own superintendent and the work is done by their order and directions.
Other cases arise where improvements are constructed by
contractors, in which the municipality is not responsible at
all, as where the improvement is of such a character that a
prudent man would not find it necessary to incunmber or obstruct the street in any respect or for any purpose, as in that

WATER COMPANY V. WARE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

case it would be clear that the defect or want of repair which
occasioned the injury was solely the result of neglect and
carelessness on the part of the contractor, and not of any
culpable fault of the officers of the municipality. Contractors with such a corporation for such a purpose may or
may not be responsible to a third party, in a case like the
present, according to the circumstances, but it is not necessary to enter much into the discussion of that topic in this
case, as the evidence shows that the defendants agreed to
become responsible for all damages which may occur by
reason of neglect of their employes in the premises. Tested
by these considerations it is quite clear that the case must
be viewed just as it would be if the work had been done by
the defendants, and not by the sub-contractors, or as if the
work had in all respects been done under the directions of
the defendants as the immediate contractors with the municipal corporation.
Where the obstruction or defect caused or created in the
street is purely collateral to the work contracted to be done,
and is entirely the result of the wrongful acts of the contractor or his workmen, the rule is that the employer is not
liable; but where the obstruction or defect which occasioned
the injury results directly from the acts which the contractor
agreed and was authorized to do, the person who employs
the contractor and authorizes him to do those acts is equally
liable to the injured party.* Exactly the same view was advanced by this court when that case was brought here by
the first writ of error,'in which the court said that if the
nuisance necessarily occurs in the ordinary mode of doing
the work the occupant or owner is liable, but if it is from
the negligence of the contractor or his servants, then he
should alone be responsible.t Common justice requires the
enforcement of that rule, as if the contractor does the thing
which he is employed to do the employer is as responsible
for the thing as if he had done it himself, but if the act
which is the subject of complaint is purely collateral to the

course of the performance of the work, the employer is not

It would be monstrous, said Lord Campbell, if a party causing another to do a thing were exempted from liability for
the act merely because there was a contract between him,
