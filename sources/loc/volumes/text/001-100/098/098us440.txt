THE " ABBOTSFORD."

[Sup. Ct.

THE " ABBOTSFORD."
1. Under the act of Feb. 16, 1875, which took effect May 1 of that year, entitled
"An Act to facilitate the disposition of cases in the Supreme Court of the
United States, and for other purposes" (18 Stat. 315), the finding of facts
by the Circuit Court in admiralty cases is conclusive; and only rulings
upon questions of law can be reviewed by bill of exceptions.
2. Where words in an act limiting the reviewing power of this court, in cases
where the facts have been found below, "to a determination of the questions of law arising upon the record and to the rulings of the court excepted
to," have acquired, through judicial interpretation, a definite meaning, by
which that power, on exceptions, is confined to questions of law, they will,
when found in a subsequent act, be presumed to be used in the same sense,
unless a contrary intention appears from the act.
3. Two schooners were sailing down the Delaware River, when a steamer proceeding in the same direction, at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour,
was, in daytime, approaching near enough to them to render it necessary to
make calculations to keep out of their way. They were in parallel courses,
not far apart, beating upon their starboard tack, and nearing the Jersey
bank. Instead of going outside of them, she, without seasonably slackening
her speed, attempted to pass between them, and came into collision with and
sunk the one nearer the bank, as the latter, having run her starboard tack
and come about on her port tack, tacked again before she was under full
headway to avoid colliding with the other schooner, which was still properly on her starboard tack. Held, that the steamer was liable.

APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Mr. Morton P. Henry for the " Abbotsford."
Mr. Henry Flanders and Mr. James B. Roney, contra.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the

court.
This is an appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in an admiralty cause on the
instance side of the court, rendered April 13, 1876. The case
was up for consideration once before at the present term, and
remanded for a finding of the facts and the conclusions of law
required by the "act to facilitate the disposition of cases in
the Supreme Court of the United States, and for other purposes" (18 Stat. 315), which went into effect May 1, 1875.
The Circuit Court has since complied with the requirements

THE 1"1ABBOTSFORD."

of that statute, and made its return, stating the facts and the
conclusions of law separately. Accompanying this return is a
bill of exceptions, which is now a part of the record. This bill
of exceptions shows that each of the parties presented to the
court requests for findings of fact upon the evidence, and the
exceptions are to the effect that the court neglected to find
certain facts claimed by the appellant to have been proved.
The evidence relied upon to prove what was claimed and not
found is set out at length.
The first question to be determined is as to the operation
and effect of the bill of exceptions. The act of 1875 provides
"that the circuit courts of the United States, in deciding causes
of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction on the instance side of
the court, shall find the facts and conclusions of law upon which
it renders its judgments or decrees, and shall state the facts and
conclusions of law separately. And in finding the facts, as before provided, said court may, upon the consent of the parties
who shall have appeared and put any matter of fact in issue, and
subject to such general rules in the premises as shall be made and
provided from time to time, impanel a jury of not less than five
and not more than twelve persons, to whom shall be submitted
the issues of fact in such cause, under the direction of the court,
as in cases at common law. And the finding of such jury, unless
set aside for lawful cause, shall be entered of record, and stand as
the finding of the court, upon which judgment shall be entered
according to law. The review of the judgments and decrees
entered upon such findings by the Supreme Court, upon appeal,
shall be limited to a determination of the questions of law arising upon the record, and to such rulings of the Circuit Court,
excepted to at the time, as may be presented by a bill of exceptions, prepared as in actions at law."
Under this statute we are clearly of the opinion that the
finding of facts in the Circuit Court is conclusive, and that the
only rulings which can be presented for review here by bill
of exceptions are those made upon questions of law. Such has
been the construction given by this court to statutes of a
similar character in a long line of decisions, commencing soon
after the court was organized. Thus, sect. 19 of the Judiciary
Act of 1789 provided that it should "be the duty of the

THE " ABBOTSFORD."

[Sup. 0t.

Circuit Court, in causes in equity and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, to cause the facts on which they found their
sentence or decree fully to appear upon the record, either from
the pleadings and decree itself, or a state of the case agreed by
the parties or their counsel, or if they disagree, by a stating of
the" case by the court." 1 Stat. 83. In Wiseart v. Dauchy
(3 Dall. 324), decided in 1796, Chief Justice Ellsworth, speaking for the court in reference to the proper practice under thig
act, said: "If causes of equity or admiralty jurisdiction are
removed hither, accompanied with a statement of facts, but
without the evidence, it is well; and the statement is conclusive
as to all the facts which it contains. This is unanimously the
opinion of the court. If such causes are removed with a statement of the facts, and also with the evidence, still the statement
is conclusive as to all the facts contained in it. This is the
opinion of the court, but not unanimously." Soon afterwards
the act of 1803 (2 Stat. 244), allowing appeals, was passed,
which directed that, upon an appeal, "a transcript of the libel,
bill, answer, depositions, and all other proceedings of what kind
soever in the cause," should be transmitted to this court, and
consequently the question did not again come up for consideration until after the "act to regulate the mode of practice in
the courts of the United States for the district of Louisiana"
(4 Stat. 62), passed May 26,1824. Under the Louisiana practice, which was adopted by this act for the courts of the United
States in that district, trials were allowed by the court without
a jury, and almost immediately questions arose as to the manner in which such cases should be brought to this court for
review by writ of error. There was much difficulty in reaching a settlement of the practice, but in United States v. King
(7 How. 845), it was decided unanimously "that the decision
of the Circuit Court upon the questions of fact must, like the
finding of a jury, be regarded as conclusive; that the writ of
error can bring up nothing but questions of law." Following
this was the case of Bond v. Brown (12 id. 256), where
Mr. Chief Justice Taney said: "And whether the fact was
rightly decided or not according to the evidence is not open to
inquiry in this court. The decision of the court below in this
respect is as conclusive as the verdict of a jury when the case

is brought here by writ of error." Other cases to the same
effect may be found. Such is now the settled law with reference to trials of issues of fact in Louisiana, when a review is
sought in this court by writ of error.
In 1865 an act of Congress was passed (18 Stat. 501), which
is as follows: "That. issues of fact in civil cases in any circuit court of the
United States may be tried and determined by the court without
the intervention of a jury, whenever the parties, or their attorneys
of record, file a stipulation in writing with the clerk waiving a jury.
The finding of the court upon the facts, which finding may be
either general or special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of
a jury. The rulings of the court in the cause in the progress of
the trial, when excepted to at the time, may be reviewed by the
Supreme Court of the United States upon a writ of error, or upon
appeal, provided the rulings be duly presented by bill of exceptions.
When the finding is special, the review may also extend to the
determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to support the
judgment."
This statute has been reproduced in sects. 649 and 700 of the
Revised Statutes, and under it we have universally held that a
bill of exceptions cannot be used to bring up the evidence for a
review of the findings of fact. The facts, as found and stated
by the court below, are conclusive. The case stands here precisely the same as though they had been found by the verdict
of a jury. .Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wal..125; Basset v. United
States, id. 88; Copelin v. Insurance Company, id. 461; Coddington v. Richardson, 10 id. 516; Miller v. Insurance Company, 12 id. 295; Insurance Company v. Folsom, 18 id. 249;
Insurance (company v. Sea, 21 id. 158 ; Jennisons v. Leonard,
id. 302.
At the December Term, 1865, under the authority we have to
prescribe rules by which appeals may be taken from the Court
of Claims to this court, we provided that such appeals should
be had on the transcript of the record, &e., below, and "a finding of the facts in the case by the said Court of Claims, and
the conclusions of law on said facts, on which the court founds
its judgment or decree. The finding of facts dnd conclusions
of law to be stated separately, and certified to this court as part

of the record. The facts so found are to be the ultimate facts
or propositions which the evidence shall establish, in the nature of a special verdict, and not the evidence on which these
ultimate facts are founded." 3 Wall. vii. This rule was
changed somewhat in form but not in substance, Oct. 12, 1873.
17 id. xvii. In the case of DeGroot v. United States (5 id.
419), decided in 1866, we took occasion to say that the object
of this rule was "to present in a simple form the questions
of law which arose in the progress of the case, and which were
decided adversely to the appellant. Only such statement of
facts is intended to be brought to this court as may be necessary to enable it to decide upon the correctness of the propositions of law ruled by the Court of Claims, and that is to
be presented in the shape of facts found by that court, to
be established by the evidence, in such form as to raise the
legal question decided by the court. It should not include
the evidence in detail." This practice has always been strictly
adhered to.
From this it is apparent that when the act of 1875 was
passed, words in a statute limiting the power of this court in
the review of cases where the facts had been found below "to
a determination of the questions of law arising upon the record
and to the rulings of the court excepted to," had acquired,
through judicial interpretation, a well-understood legislative
meaning, and that they confined our jurisdiction to the reexamination of questions of law alone. Having that meaning,
therefore, it is to be presumed they.were used in that sense in
this instance, unless the contrary is in some way made to appear. So far from there being any ,manifestation of such a
contrary intention, the reverse is very clearly indicated. Thus,
the rulings of the court on which we are authorized to pass are
such as may be presented by a bill of exceptions, prepared as in
actions at law. It is an elementary principle in the common
law that a bill of exceptions "is founded on a matter of law or
a point of law arising out of a fact not denied." 1 Saund. P1.
and Evid. 640. "The only modes known to the common law to
re-examine the facts are the granting of a new trial by the court
where the issue is tried, or to which the record is properly returnable, or the award of a venire de novo by an appellate court

foi some error of law which intervened in the proceedings."
Parsonsv. Bedford, 3 Pet. 448. By the Constitution, Amend.
VII., no fact tried by a jury can be otherwise re-examined in
any court of the United States than according to the rules of
the common law. It follows that had this case been tried by
a jury it could not be re-examined on the facts in this court,
because under the rules of the common law a bill of exceptions
could not be used for that purpose. The decision of a court
denying a new trial because the verdict of a jury is against the
evidence is not reviewable upon error in the courts of the
United States. -Pomeroy's Lessee v. Bank of Indiana, 1 Wall.
592. Since, therefore, the bill of exceptions in this class of
cases is to be taken as in actions at law, it follows most unmistakably that only such rulings are to be presented by it for our
consideration as could properly be put into a bill of exceptions
on the trial of an action at law.
This intention is still further manifested in that part of the
act which provides for a trial by jury. The trial is to be had
as at common law, and the finding of the jury on such a trial,
unless set aside for lawful cause, is to stand as the finding of
the court. No distinction is made in respect to our power of
review between cases tried by a jury and those by the court;
and if the trial is had by a jury, it is clear that the verdict was
intended to be conclusive upon us.
Taking the whole statute together, we think it clearly manifests an intention on the part of Congress to relieve us from
the great labor of weighing and considering the mass of conflicting evidence which usually filled the records in this class
of cases. There is no real injustice in this. Parties to suits
in admiralty have now the right to two trials on questions of
fact,- once in the District Court, and again on appeal in the
Circuit Court. There seems no good reason why they should
be entitled to a third trial here. At law there is but one trial,
except by leave of the court in the exercise of its supervisory
power over verdicts, and in equity only one before an appeal
to this court.
Upon the facts as found the decree of the Circuit Court was
clearly right. The schooners "Rosanna Rose" and "Gov. Burton" were beating down the Delaware River under sail, and the

THE "ABBOTSFORD."

[Sup. Cb.

"Abbotsford" was following them under steam at half-speed by
her engine, which, with the tide, gave her a speed of eight oi
nine miles an hour. When the steamer had approached near
enough to the schooners to render it necessary to make calculations to keep out of their way, the schooners were sailing on
parallel courses, not far apart, on their starboard tacks, and
nearing the Jersey side of the river. The "Rose" was to the
eastward of the" B3urton," and having run out her starboard tack
by going as near as she could in safety to what is known as the
Red Bank Shoal, she came about on her port tack. While on
that tack, and before she had got under full headway, she was
compelled to tack again to avoid a collision with the "Burton,"
still on the starboard tack and having the right of way. While
engaged in this evolution, and being "in stays," she was run
into by the steamer. The court finds that the tack of the "Rose"
on the shoal was entirely proper, both for her own safety and
in regard to the " Burton" and the steamer, as they were far
enough away to allow her to do so with perfect safety. There
was plenty of room for the steamer to pass to the westward of
both the vessels, and if she had ported her wheel a point or
half-point at any time within a distance of two miles, a collision would have been impossible. As it was, she undertook
to pass between the schooners without any necessity for so
doing, when it must have been apparent to any skilful navigator that the " Rose" was nearing the shoal, and would be compelled to come about and cross the bow of the steamer before
she could get by on the course she was steering. In addition
to this, there was the complication growing out of the proximity of the "Burton," entitled to keep on her starboard tack
after the "Rose" must come about. Notwithstanding all these
circumstances, the steamer held her course and speed until she
had approached so close to the vessel that there was neither room
nor time to overcome her momentum when she became involved
in the necessary and proper movements of the "Rose" to keep out
of the way of the "Burton."
A prudent navigator would have
avoided this danger by a change of course or a slackening of
speed long before. The collision occurred between nine and
ten o'clock in the morning, and there is no pretence that both
schooners were not in full view from the steamer for a suffi-

cient time to enable her to make the necessary movement to
keep out of their way. The collision was due alone to the fact
that the steamer undertook to pass between the schooners when
she should have gone outside of them.

the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District
of Missouri.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

MAr. Assistant Attorney- General Smith for the United States.
Mr. Louis Benecke, in propriapersona, contra.
AIR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.

The defendant, Louis Benecke, was indicted in the District
Court for the Western District of Missouri, and the sixth and
tenth counts of the indictment charged him with unlawfully
withholding arrearages of pay and bounty from persons for
whom, as agent and attorney, he had collected the same from
the United States.
In the one case, the date was alleged to be the sixteenth day
of March, 1868, and in the other the 17th of the same month,
and in both continuing thereafter.
On these counts the defendant was found guilty in the
Circuit Court; and on motion for a new trial and arrest of
