POWDER COMPANY V. POWDER WORKS.
1. Reissued letters-patent must be for the same invention as that which formed
the subject of the original letters; or for a part thereof when divisional
reissues are granted. They must not contain any thing substantially new
or different.
2. Original letters for a process will not support reissued letters for a composition, unless it is the result of the process, and the invention of the one involves the invention of the other.
.3. Letters granted for certain processes of exploding nitro-glycerine will not
support reissued letters for a composition of nitro-glycerine and gunpowder
or other substances, even though the original application claimed the invention of the process and the compound. They are distinct inventions.
4. The last clause of sect. 53 of the act of July 8, 1870 (16 Stat. 205; Rev.
Stat., sect. 4916), relates merely to the evidence to which the commissioner
of patents may resort, but does not increase his power as to the invention
for which a reissue may be granted. Whether said clause relates to any
other than letters granted for machines is a question not considered in this
case.
5. Reissued letters-patent No. 4818, for a new and useful improvement in compounds containing nitro-glycerine, and reissued letters-patent No. 4819, for
a new and useful improvement in nitro-glycerine compounds, granted
March 19, 1872, to the United States Blasting Oil Company, assignee of
Alfred Nobel, are for a different invention from that described or suggested
in original letters-patent No. 60,617, granted to said Nobel Oct. 24, 1865, for
a new and useful improved substitute for gunpowder, upon which they are
founded, and which they are intended, in part, to supersede. They are
therefore void.
6. When there is a demurrer to the whole bill, and also to part, and the latter
only is sustained, the proper decree is to dismiss so much of the bill as
seeks relief in reference to the matters adjudged to be bad, overrule the
demurrer to the residue, and direct the defendant to answer thereto.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of California.
This is an appeal from a decree disniissing, upon demurrer,
a bill filed by the Giant Powder Company against the California Powder Works and others, charging them with the
infringement of three certain letters-patent belonging to the
complainant, and praying for an injunction and a decree for
damages. These letters, for certain alleged inventions of one
Alfred Nobel, of Hamburg, in Germany, relating to the use
of nitro-glycerine in the manufacture of dynamite and other
explosive compounds, are all reissues; two of them bearing
date the nineteenth day of March, 1872, and numbered re-

POWDER CO. v. POWDER WORKS.

spectively 4818 and 4819; and the third bearing date the
seventeenth day of March, 1874, and numbered 5799. No.
4818 is for the mixture of gunpowder with nitro-glycerine;
No. 4819 is for the mixture of rocket powder with nitroglycerine; and No. 5799 is for a mixture of nitro-glycerine
with porous or absorbent substances, forming what is called
dynamite, or giant powder. The hill sets out the substance of
the original and intermediate letters as well as those sued on,
and of some of them makes profert. A consent order was made
in the cause, that the complainant should file, as parts of the bill,
copies of the several letters mentioned and described therein,
of which profert was so made. The bill also sets forth by way
of schedule a copy of the original application of Nobel filed in
the Patent Office on the sixteenth day of September, 1865.
From the statements of the bill, and the documents thus
annexed to and made part thereof, it appears that Alfred
Nobel, on the day last aforesaid, by his attorney, filed in the
Patent Office a paper describing certain alleged discoveries
and inventions made by him in reference to the use of nitroglycerine as an explosive agent and as a component in explosive compounds. Having in this document referred to the
well-known property of nitro-glycerine, and the nitrates of
ethyl and methyl, nitro-mannite, &c., whereby they cannot be
exploded in open space by the application of fire, he proceeds
to point out how he succeeds in effecting their explosion. He
says: "A chief point of my invention consists in overcoming this difficulty. According as nitro-glycerine is to be used for fire-arms or
for blasting, I adopt two different methods for promoting its
explosion, viz.: "1st Method. By mixing it with gunpowder, gun-cotton, or
any other substance developing a rapid heat, nitro-glycerine being
an oil, fills the pores of gunpowder, and is heated by the latter to
the degree of its explosion. Gunpowder treated in this way. can
take up from ten to fifty per cent of nitro-glycerine, and develops
a greater power with a lesser quickness of explosion. Where the
only object in view is to reduce the quickness of explosion of gunpowder, I mix it with or make it absorb common non-explosive oil
from one to ten per cent of its weight.

POWDER CO. V. POWDER WORKS.

[Sup. Ct.

" 2d .Method. When nitro-glycerine is to be used for blasting,
where quickness of explosion is of great importance, I submit it to
the most rapid source of heat known ; viz., that developed by pressure. To effect this, I make use of the pressure developed by heating a minute portion of nitro-glycerine, or by the detonation of
any other violently exploding substance. Nitro-glycerine being a
liquid, if it cannot escape, as for instance in a bore, receives and
propagates the initial pressure through its whole mass, and is by
that pressure instantaneously heated ; hence the first impulse of
explosion decomposes the rest. There are many means of obtaining this impulse of explosion, such as "1. When nitro-glycerine in tubes is surrounded by gunpowder,
or vice versa.
"2. By the spark or heat developed by a strong electric current
when the nitro-glycerine is enclosed on all sides, so as not to afford
*anescape to the gas developed.
"3. By a capsule," &a., six different methods of producing explosion of nitro-glycerine being pointed out, accompanied by drawings
for showing the manner in which they were employed.
He then claims as his invention: 1. The use of gunpowder or similar substances, when mixed
with nitro-glycerine or analogous substances.
2. The reduction of the quickness of explosion of gunpowder
by mixing it with oily explosive, or non-explosive substances.
3. The effecting the detonation of nitro-glycerinp or analogous substances (which can be ignited without exploding) by
the heat developed by pressure, promoting an impulse of explosion which decomposes the rest.
4. The exclusive use of nitro-glycerine and the class of substances described above, or mixtures of such as far as their
application may be classed under any of the methods indicated in this memorandum.
He then describes a new method of preparing or manufacturing nitro-glycerine, and claims to be the inventor of
that.
The bill further states, that after filing the above, application
Nobel's agent (one Howson) filed certain amendments thereto,
striking out a portion of the original; and on the twentyfourth day of October, 1865, upon such amended application,

Oct. 1878.]

POWDER CO. v. POWDER WORKS.

letters-patent were granted to Nobel for the term of seventeen
years, numbered 50,617; and profert is made of the same in
the bill, and they are set out in the record.
By reference to the specification of these letters, which are
accompanied with drawings, they appear to be for a process,
to wit, the process of using nitro-glycerine, or its equivalent,
as a substitute for gunpowder, by exploding it in the manner
pointed out. Having explained the nature of nitro-glycerine,
nitrate of ethyl, methyl, and nitro-mannite, as in the original
paper, the specification then points out how nitro-glycerine
may be exploded after being confined in a hole drilled in the
rock when to be used for blasting, or in a case when to be
used for other purposes. Four distinct modes of doing this
are enumerated: first, by exploding gunpowder in contact with
the liquid; secondly, by passing an electric spark through a
fine wire immersed in it ; thirdly, by inserting in it a thin
case containing lime-water; and,fourtly,by a fuse. The drawings show the manner in which the wire is arranged for passing an electric spark through the fluid.
The bill then states that on the 13th of April, 1869, the
above patent was surrendered, and four new divisional patents
were issued for the same inventions for which the original
patent was granted, numbered respectively reissues 3377, 3378,
3379, 3380 ; the first, No. 3377, being for the method of exploding nitro-glycerine by detonation; the second, No. 3378,
being for the application and use of percussion caps and other
exploders to create the detonation necessary to explode the
nitro-glycerine; the third, No. 3379, being for the improved
mode of manufacturing nitro-glycerine; and the fourth, No.
3380, being (as stated in the bill) for the new explosive compounds invented by Nobel, viz. the mixture of gunpowder and
nitro-glycerine, and the mixture of gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine, and the mixture of rocket powder and nitro-glycerine.
These four reissued patents are not referred to by way of
yrofert in the bill; but the above description of their purport
is sufficient for the purpose of understanding their character.
The bill then states that on the nineteenth day of March,
1872, the said reissue 3380 was surrendered, and two new
divisional patents for the same inventions were issued in lieu.

thereof, numbered respectively reissues 4818 and 4819; the former being for the mixture of gunpowder with nitro-glycerine,
and the latter for the mixture of rocket powder with nitroglycerine ; and each patent securing to the patentee the exclusive right of making, using, and vending the explosive compound
therein described respectively. These are two of the patents
on which the suit is brought; and profert is made of them in
the bill, and they are set oat in the record. By reference
thereto, it appears that in reissue 4818 the patentee claims, 1. The utilization, as explosives, of nitro-glycerine and the
analogous liquid substances before mentioned (nitrate of ethyl,
&c.), by combining therewith gunpowder, gun-cotton, or other
similar substances developing a rapid beat or combustion, substantially as described.
2. The combination of gunpowder with nitro-glycerine, substantially as and for the purposes described.
3. The combination of gun-cotton with nitro-glycerine, substantially, &c.
In reissue 4819 the claim is for the mixture of nitro-glycerine and rocket powder.
The remainder of the bill is taken up in setting forth the
other patent sued on, and various assignments by which the
complainant deduces its title to the patents, with the allegation of infringement and prayer for relief.
To this bill the defendant demurred, as well to the whole
bill for want of equity as to the relief sought in respect of
the different patents taken separately ; also for multifariousness, misjoinder of defendants, &c.
The demurrer having been sustained and a final decree entered dismissing the bill, the Giant Powder Company brought
the case here.
Mr. M. A. Wheaton and Mr. William Bakewell for the
appellant.
The vital question in this case is, Did the commissioner,
when granting the reissues, have the right to look into Nobel's
original specification on file, for the purpose of ascertaining
what those inventions were, or was he confined to the amended
specification which was issued with the letters-patent?
The Circuit Court decided that he could only look to the

Oct. 1878.]

POWDER Co. v. POWDER WORKS.

amended specification. For this reason they decided reissues
Nos. 4818 and 4819 to be void, and sustained the demurrer.
If, therefore, he bad a right to look at the original specification, the decree must be reversed.
Both upon authority and reason, he had the right, and was
bound in duty, to look as well to the original as to the amended
specification.
Although most of the adjudications on this point were made
under the act of 1836, they are equally applicable to that of
1870. The former did not say what should be used as evidence
to -prove the original invention on an application for a reissue.
As a matter of law and also of fact, the original specification,
drawings, and model are never issued with the patent. They
remain on file; copies only are issued.
There are many cases in which the term "original specification" is used, instead of naming that which issues with the
patent. The correct rule is laid down in the case of Collar
Company v. lT an Dwsen (23 Wall. 557, 558), in the following
language: "Repeated decisions also have established the rule
that parol testimony is not admissible in an application for a reissued patent, so as to enlarge the scope and effect of the invention beyond what was described, suggested, or substantially
indicated in the original specification, drawings, or PatentOffice model, as the purpose of a surrender and reissue is not to
introduce new features, ingredients, or devices, but to render
effectual the actual invention for which the original patent
should have been granted.
This is the whole point in this case; and it seems too plain
for argument that Seymour v. Osborne (11 Wall. 516) holds that
the original specification may be examined as claimed by us.
Sect. 5 of the act of 1837, and sect. 53 of the act of 1870,
permitted several patents to issue for" distinct and separate
parts of the thing patented."
The words "thing patented " here used doubtless refer to the
thing patented by the reissues.
Nobel's whole inventions were made in utilizing nitro-glycerine. One of them was the method of exploding it by mixing
it with well-known explosives which explode by the application of fire. One distinct and separate part of it was mixing

POWDER CO. v. POWDER WORKS.

[Sup. Ct.

nitro-glycerine with gunpowder, another with gun-cotton, another with rocket powder, and so on. Every divisional patent
issued for each one of these mixtures was valid, and reissue
No. 4819 was, of course, one of them.
The law allowed divisional reissues. Sect. 5, act of March 3,
1837; act of 1870, sect. 53; Goodyear v. Providence R~ubber
Co., 2 Fish. 499; s. c. 9 Wall. 788; Goodyear v. Wait, 3 Fish.
242; Pennsylvania Salt Co. v. Thomas, 5 id. 148; Bennett v.
Fowler, 8 Wall. 445.
The act of 1870, sect. 53, re-enacted by sect. 4916 of the
Revised Statutes, expressly provides for the introduction of new
matter into the reissue of letters-patent for a process. When it
was passed, there were well known, and had long been known,
two classes of patents, - one with models and drawings, and the
other without. The last part of the section refers to the class
which includes those for processes, and not to the former class
that is, patents for machines.
As new matter was proper to be introduced into the two
reissues Nos. 4818 and 4819, the court below erred in sustaining
the demurrer.
The grant of the reissue is prima facie evidence that the
commissioner did his duty, and that the reissues wer.e granted
on proof satisfactory to him that whatever new matter was
introduced into them was a part of the original invention,
omitted by inadvertence, accident, or mistake from the specification attached to the original patent.
In the present case, the matter omitted from the original
patent, and which forms the subject-matter of reissue No. 4818,
is found in the original specification on the records of the office.
Furthermote, neither model nor drawing of any thing embraced
in that reissue was filed, for the reason that the invention is
not, in that way, susceptible of illustration, being not a machine, but a combination of nitro-glycerine with gunpowder,
gun-cotton, or similar substances.
The court below having sustained the demurrer so far only
as reissues Nos. 4818 and 4819 are concerned, it erred in dismissing the whole bill. 1 Daniell, Ch. Pr., p. 543, sect. 1,
p. 589, sect. 3, p. 598, sect. 5; Livingston v. Story, 9 Pet. 632.
The point on which the court below held reissues Nos. 4818

Oct. 1878.]

POWDEM Co. v. POWDER WoRxs.

and 4819 to be invalid was that these reissues were not for the
same invention as the original patent.
This is a question which should not have been decided without affording the parties an opportunity to offer evidence for
the consideration of the court. Seymour v. Osborne, supra;
Battin v. Taggart, 17 how. 74-85.
It is distinctly alleged in the bill that Nobel was the original
and first inventor of the subject-matter of the several patents in
suit; that the patents were duly granted; that the surrenders
and reissues were duly made; that the reissues were for the same
inventions ; that the title was in the complainant; and that the
defendants had infringed each of said patents. These facts
being admitted by the demurrer are sufficient to establish
the complainant's equity, and to entitle it to a decree. Welford, Eq. P1., pp. 261-265; Kay v. Marshall, 2 Webs. P. C.
89; 1 Myl. & Or. 873; IFesthead v. Zeene, 1 Beav. 287.
If any of these facts are denied by the demurrer, it is no
longer a demurrer, but a plea by demurrer, which is bad, and
therefore should have been overruled.
Hr. George Harding,contra.
MR. JusIcE BRADLEY, after stating the facts, delivered
the opinion of the court.
The main defence relied on by the counsel of the defence,
on the demurrer, is, that it is apparent that the reissued patents numbered 4818 and 4819 are not for the same invention
as that which was described in the original letters-patent numbered 50,617, for a portion of which they purport to be reissues.
It is apparent, they say, that the original patent was for a
process, to wit, a mode, or different modes, of exploding nitroglycerine; whereas the reissues are for manufactured compounds or mixtures, namely, mixtures of nitro-glycerine with
gunpowder, gun-cotton, and rocket powder. It is contended
that a process and a mixture are the subjects of different inventions; that a patent granted for one cannot, by its surrender,
be the basis of a reissued patent for the other. If this position
is sound, and the matter can be examined on demurrer, it was
not error to dismiss the bill as to all relief sought in reference
to the two reissues in question.

POWDER CO. V. POWDER WORKS.

[Sup. Ct.

We have no doubt that the question may be examined on
demurrer; for the bill sets forth in full both the original patent and the reissues, so that they may be examined and compared together. If it were a case in which the identity or
non-identity of the inventions in the original and reissued patents was a complicated question, the court might require the
defendants to answer, in order to have the benefit of evidence
on the subject. But in ordinary cases, the court itself will
compare them. Whether a patent is for a process or a composition is especially a question of construction, and is for the
court to decide; and whether a patent for a process is the same
invention as a patent for a composition is certainly a mere
question of law. We feel no hesitation, therefore, in approaching the consideration of the questions presented by the pleadings.
Upon due examination of the patents in question, it cannot
well be doubted that the original patent, No. 50,617, granted on
the 24th of October, 1865, was for a process, or rather for different processes and appliances for producing the explosion of
nitro-glycerine ; nor can it be doubted that the reissued patents,
Nos. 4818 and 4819, granted in 1872, are for compounds and
mixtures; in other words, for compositions of matter. In the
specification of the original patent, the inventor says: "My
invention consists in the use as a substitute for gunpowder of
nitro-glycerine, or its equivalent, substantially in the manner
described hereafter, so that the said liquid, which, when exposed, cannot be wholly decomposed and exploded, shall by
confinement be subjected to heat and pressure, by which its
total and immediate decomposition and explosion is effected."
He then proceeds: "In order to enable others to make and
use my invention, I will now proceed to describe the method of
carrying it into effect. On reference to the accompanying
drawing which forms a part of this specification, Fig. 1 is a
view, partly in section, of one apparatus by means of which I
render nitro-glycerine, or its equivalent, available as a substitute for gunpowder; and Fig. 2 is a plan view. There is a class
of explosive substances comprising nitro-glycerine, the nitrates
of ethyl and methyl, and nitro-mannite, which have long been
known, but have never been practically applied as explosive

Oct. 1878.]

POWDER CO. V. POWDER WORKS.

agents." He then describes the behavior of these substances,
-when, being in an unconfined state, they are subjected to appliances of flame and contusion, no explosion being thereby
produced; and then shows how, when they are in a confined
state, their complete explosion may be produced by the processes which be describes; adding, " The chief point of my
invention consists in overcoming the difficulty of suddenly igniting the entire mass of the materials mentioned, so that the
same can be practically used as explosive agents." He then
shows how nitro-glycerine may be best prepared and manufactured for the purposes of use as an explosive agent. Then he
describes the four several methods or appliances for producing
the explosion desired, which have already been referred to,
concluding with this formal claim: "I claim as my invention,
and desire to secure by letters-patent, the use of nitro-glycerine,
or its equivalent, substantially in the manner. and for the purposes described." The only equivalents of nitro-glycerine referred to or pointed at in the specification are the cognate
substances of nitrate of ethyl and methyl and nitro-mannite.
It is to be presumed that these are referred to when the patentee uses the expression, "nitro-glycerine or its equivalent."
Now, in all this specification there is not a hint of any new
mixture or new composition of matter having been invented
by the patentee. The only thing that approaches it is the
method which he describes, of preparing the pure nitro-glycerine. The whole invention set forth, described, and claimed
consists of methods or processes of exploding the substance so
as to render it a useful exploding agent. The technical form.
of the claim, it is true, is in appearance a little broader, being
for the use (generally) of nitro-glycerine as an exploding
agent; but these general terms are properly limited by those
which follow, namely, "substantially in the manner and for
the purposes described." If any other method of exploding
nitro-glycerine should be discovered different from the processes invented and described by the patentee, it could be employed without infringing his patent. According to our view,
therefore, the patent is for those processes and methods as
applied to the use of nitro-glycerine, or its equivalent, as an
explosive agent.

POWDER Co. v. POWDER WORKS.

[Sup. Ct;.

Inasmuch as the reissued patents in question, numbered
4818 and 4819, are for compounds of nitro-glycerine with
various other substances, it is impossible not to say that they
are for an entirely different invention from that secured, or
attempted to be secured, by the original patent.
If the patent had been not for the mode or process of exploding nitro-glycerine, but for the process of compounding nitroglycerine with gunpowder and other substances, inadvertently
omitting to claim the exclusive use of the substances so produced, the case would have been one of very different consideration. That was the case with Goodyear's patent, which was
issued in 1844, and claimed only the process of vulcanizing
india-rubber. In 1849 it was surrendered, and two new patents
issued in lieu thereof, - one for the process, and the other for the
composition. In 1852, the validity of these reissues came up
for consideration in the third circuit, in the case of Goodyear
v. Day, which was argued by Mr. Choate, Mr. Webster, and
other eminent counsel. Mr. Justice Grier disposed of the objections as follows: "We now come to the objections which
have been made to the reissued or amended patents of 1849.
The first objection is that the patents of 1844 and 1849 are
not for the same invention. This objection is not founded in
fact. Both patents are for precisely the same invention or
discovery. They both describe, in nearly the same words, the
best mode of manufacturing india-rubber, by exposing it to a
high degree of heat in connection with sulphur and white lead;
by which treatment the substance is endowed with new and valuable qualities which it did not possess before. The discovery
is the same; the mode of manufacturing the compound is the
same. The first patent had set forth the nature and extent of
the invention defectively. There is no reason to doubt the
bonafides and propriety of the reissue. It is apparent on the
face of the papers, even if the action of the commissioner on
that point was not conclusive." Again, he adds: "The fourth
objection is ' that the latter patent claims more than was contained in the original.' If the latter patent is for precisely the
same invention, art, or discovery as that described in the first,
the objection that it claims more is a mistake of fact. If the
last patent differs from the first only in stating more clearly

Oct. 1878.]

PoWDER Co. v. PowDER WORKS.

and definitely the real principles of the invention, so that those
who wish to pirate it may not be allowed to escape with impunity through the imperfection of the language used in the first,
there has arisen one of the cases for which it was the intention
of the act of Congress to provide, and the objection is worthless in point of law." This case is partially reported in 2 Wall.
Jr. 283, but the opinion of Mr. Justice Grier is not stated in
full. In another case, arising on the original patent of Goodyear, reported in 2 Wall. Jr. 356, Mr. Justice Grier used this
expression: "The product and the process constitute one discovery." The product in Goodyear's invention was the direct
result of the process. They were parts of one invention, and,
except in imagination, could no more be separated from each
other than the two sides of a sheet of paper, or than a shadow
from the body that produces it.
The present case is entirely different. * The processes which
the patentee described as his invention in the original patent,
*No. 50,617, had no connection with the compounds or mixtures which are patented in the reissued patents. They were not
processes for making those compounds, and in describing them
the compounds were not mentioned. The invention of the one
did not involve the invention of the other. The two inventions
might have been made by different persons, and at different
times.
We think, therefore, that the conclusion is irresistible, that
the two reissued patents, numbered 4818 and 4819, are for a
different invention from that described or suggested in the original patent No. 50,617, upon which they are founded, and which
they are intended, in part, to supersede.
These reissues being granted in 1872, were subject to the
law as it then stood, being the act of July 8, 1870, the fiftythird section of which (reproduced in sect. 4916 of the Revised Statutes) relates to the matter in question. It seems to
us impossible to read this section carefully without coming to
the conclusion that a reissue can only be granted for the same
invention which formed the subject of the original patent of
which it is a reissue. The express words of the act are, "a
new patent for the same invention ;" and these words are copied
from thie act of 1836, which in this respect was substantially

POWDER CO. V. POWDER WORKS.

[Sup. Ct.

the same as the act of 1870. The specification may be amended
so as to make it more clear and distinct; the claim may be
modified so as to make it more conformable to the exact rights
of the patentee; but the invention must be the same. So
particular is the law on this subject, that it is declared that
"no new matter shall be introduced into the specification.This prohibition is general, relating to all patents; and by
"new matter" we suppose to be meant new substantive matter, such as would have the effect of changing the invention,
or of introducing what might be the subject of another application for a patent. The danger to be provided against was
the temptation to amend a patent so as to cover improvements
which might have come into use, or might have been invented
by others, after its issue. The legislature was willing to concede to the patentee the right to amend his specification so as
fully to describe and claim the very invention attempted to be
secured by his original patent, and which was not fully secured
thereby, in consequence of inadvertence, accident, or mistake;
but was not willing to give him the right to patch up his patent by the addition of other inventions, which, though they
might be his, had not been applied for by him, or, if applied
for, had been abandoned or waived. For such inventions, he
is required to make a new application, subject to such rights as
the public and other inventors may have acquired in the mean
time. This, we think, is what the present statute means, and
what, indeed, was the law before its enactment under the
previous act of 1836. If decisions can be found which present
it in any different aspect, we cannot admit them to be correct
expositions of the law.
The counsel for the complainant refers us to, and places
special reliance on, the last clause of sect. 53 of the act of 1870,
where it is said: "But where there is neither model nor drawing, amendments may be made upon proof satisfactory to the
commissioner that such new matter or amendment was a part
of the original invention, and was omitted from the specification by inadvertence, accident, or mistake." But this clause
relates only to the evidence which may be employed by the
commissioner in ascertaining the defects of the specification.
It does not authorize him to grant a reissue for a different

Oct. 1878.]

POWDER Co. v. POWDER WORKS.

invention, or to determine that one invention is the same as
another and different one; or that two inventions essentially
distinct constitute but one. In this case, it is not necessary
for us to decide, and we express no opinion as to the precise
meaning and extent of the final clause of sect. 53, to which we
have referred ; as, whether it relates to all patents, or only to
patents for machines. But as it relates to the matter of evidence alone, it cannot enlarge the power of the commissioner
in reference to the invention for which a reissue may be granted.
-That power is restricted, by the general terms of the section,
to the same invention which was originally patented. Conceding that the commissioner had a right, in this case, by
virtue of the clause in question, to examine the original application of Nobel, as it stood before it was amended, in order
to ascertain what his invention really was, it would only show
that he described, in that paper, two different inventions,one for a composition, and another for a process distinct from
the composition. It would not prove that the two inventions were the same; and it would not authorize the commissioner, on a reissue, to add the one to the other, as a part
thereof.
The complainant insists, however, that the present reissues
are for the same invention which was patented in the reissued
patent, No. 8380, granted in April, 1869; and that the latter reissue was granted before the passage of the act of 1870. But this
fact does not help the complainant. The law relating to reissues was substantially the same under the act of 1836 as it is
uider the act of 1870. As before remarked, the former act as
well as the latter restricted the power of the commissioner, in
granting reissues, to "the same invention" which was the subject of the original patent. It has been repeatedly so held by
this court, as the following cases will show: Burr v. -Duryee,
1 Wall. 531; Seymour v. Osborne, 11 id. 516; Gill v. Wells,
22 id. 1; The Wood _Paper Patent,23 id. 566.
Since, therefore, the reissues in question are not for the same
invention for which the original patent was granted, it follows
that they are void; and the bill must be dismissed so far as
relates to the said reissued patents numbered respectively 4818
and 4819.

v. BOARD OF LIQUIDATION.

[Sup. Ct.

As nothing is shown, however, in the statements of the bill,
which affects the validity of the third patent sued on, the bill
should not have been dismissed as a whole, but only as to the
said reissues 4818 and 4819. For this error the decree must
be reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to enter
a decree in conformity with this opinion, dismissing the bill as
to all relief sought therein in respect of, or in reference to or
founded upon, the said reissued patents numbered respectively
4818 and 4819, and, as to the residue of the bill, overruling
the demurrer and directing the defendants to answer in accordance with the rules and practice of the court.

So ordered.

v. BOARD OF LIQUIDATION.

1. Where the record shows that a Federal question was not necessarily involved,
this court has no jurisdiction to -review the decision of the Supreme Court

funding board of that State to fund the bonds of a railroad company,
whereon the State is liable only as a guarantor.
