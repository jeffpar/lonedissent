[Sup. Ct.

State in 1863, because the code was not read three times in
each house of the General Assembly, as required by the State
Constitution, it is sufficient to say the Supreme Court of the
State has decided they were, and its decision of such a question is not open for revision by us in a case brought here from
a State court. Pennsylvania College Cases, 13 Wall. 190.
Judgment affirmed.
NOTE. -Railroad Company v. Georgia, error to the Supreme Court of the

States for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting in bankruptcy,
against the Cleveland Insurance Company, asking to have the
last-named company adjudged a bankrupt. To this petition
the Cleveland Insurance Company in due time appeared and
filed its answer, and on the 16th of October, 1874, after hearing in the District Court, a judgment was entered dismissing
the petition. On the 16th of December, a bill of exceptions
was signed by the district judge and filed in the cause, which
contained a statement of all the evidence submitted upon the
hearing, with the findings of the District Court thereon both
as to the facts and the law. On the same day, the following
writ of error, omitting the mere formal parts, was sued out
of the Circuit Court: "Because in the record and proceedings, and also in the
rendition of judgment, in a certain matter which is in the said
District Court in bankruptcy before you, wherein the Globe
Insurance Company is petitioning creditor against the Cleveland Insurance Company, debtor, a manifest error hath happened, to the great damage of the said Globe Insurance
Company, as by its complaint appears; and it being fit that the
error, if any there bath been, should be duly corrected, and full
and speedy justice done to the parties aforesaid in this behalf,
you are hereby commanded, if judgment be therein given, that
then, under your seal, distinctly and openly, you send the record
and proceedings, with all things concerning the same, to the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Sixth Circuit and
Northern District of Ohio, together with this writ, so that you
have the same at Cleveland, in said district, on the fifth day of
January next, in the said Circuit Court to be then and there
held, that the record and proceedings aforesaid being inspected,
the said Circuit Court may cause further to be done therein to
correct that error what of right and according to the law and
custom of the United States should be done."
On the next day, in obedience to the command of this writ,
a transcript of the proceedings and judgment of the District
Court, including the bill of exceptions, was sent to the Circuit
Court, and on the 27th of November, 1875, the Cleveland Insurance Company appeared in the Circuit Court and moved to
dismiss the writ, for the following reasons : -

368

CLEVELAND INS.

Co. v.

GLOBE INS.

CO.

[Sup. Ct.

" 1st, Because this being a petition in involuntary bankruptcy, where the bankrupt or debtor demanded no jury, but
hearing was had to the court, the case is not removable into
this court by writ of error, but by petition for review, or other
proper process under the first clause of the second section of the
Bankrupt Act.
" 2d, Because the debt or damages claimed in the petition
herein do not amount to more than $500; in fact, no debt or
damages are claimed at all.
" 3d, Because the writ of error herein was not sued out or
taken within ten days after the entry of the decree or decision
of the District Court herein, nor were the statutes regulating
the granting of writs of error complied with within ten days
after the entry of the decree or decision of the District Court."
This motion was overruled, and on the 15th of June, 1876,
the Circuit Court, after hearing, "as well upon the transcript
of the judgment and other proceedings between the parties in
the District Court; . . . brought here by writ of error from
this court to said District Court, as also upon the matters by
the said Globe Insurance Company herein assigned for error,"
entered its judgment as follows "Therefore, it is considered that the judgment aforesaid for
the errors aforesaid be reversed, annulled, and altogether held
for naught, and that the said Globe Insurance Company be
restored to all things which it has lost by occasion of said
judgment, and recover against the said Cleveland Insurance
Company its costs in this behalf expended, taxed at $60.65.
"And thereupon it is ordered that a special mandate be sent
down to said District Court to carry this judgment into execution. And it is further ordered that this cause be remanded
to the said District Court by writ of procedendo, commanding
the judge of said court to proceed according to law to set aside
its order dismissing the petition of the said Globe Insurance
Company, and thereupon to adjudge the said Cleveland Insurance Company bankrupt, as prayed for in and by said petition
of said Globe Insurance Company, and further to proceed in said
matter in such manner according to the laws of the land as he
shall see proper, the said writ of error to the contrary notwithstanding."

CLEVELAND INS.

Co. v. GLOBE INS. 00.

869

To reverse this judgment the present writ of error has been
sued out of this court by the Cleveland Insurance Company,
and the Globe Insurance Company now moves to dismiss the
suit for want of jurisdiction.
In Sanduskcy v. National Bank (23 Wall. 289) and Hill v.
Thompson (94 U. S. 322) it was decided that the only remedy
provided for the correction of errors in a proceeding in the
District Court for an adjudication in bankruptcy was such as
could be had under the supervisory jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court, and as to that jurisdiction it is well settled that the
action of the Circuit Court is final and not subject to review
in this court. The correctness of these decisions is conceded,
but the plaintiff in error claims that as the Circuit Court
could only take jurisdiction under its supervisory power, and
the case was actually taken to that court by writ of error, this
court, under the rule laid down in Stickney v. Wilt (23 Wall.
150), must reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court, and
remand the cause with instructi6ns to grant the motion to
dismiss the writ.
The section of the Revised Statutes which grants to the
Circuit Court its supervisory jurisdiction is as follows: "SECT. 4986. The Circuit Court for each district shall have a
general superintendence and jurisdiction of all cases and questions
arising in the District Court for such district when sitting as a court
in bankruptcy; . . and, except when special provision is otherwise made, may, upon bill, petition, or other proper process, of any
party aggrieved, hear and determine the case as in a court of
equity; and the powers and jurisdiction hereby granted may be
exercised either by the court in term time or in vacation by the
ciecuit justice or the circuit judge of the circuit."
No particular form of proceeding is required in order to take
the case to the Circuit Court for review under this jurisdiction.
It is sufficient if some "proper process" for that purpose is
employed; and in Insurance Company v. Comstock (16 Wall.
259), which, like this, was a suit in involuntary bankruptcy
against an insurance company, this court held that a writ of
error was "proper process" when the questions to be re-examined arose upon a bill of exceptions taken at a jury trial under
VOL. VIII.

24

[Sup. Ct.

sect. 5026, Rev. Stat., to ascertain the alleged fact of bankruptcy. In that case the Circuit Court, upon its own motion,
dismissed the writ " for want of jurisdiction, holding that a
writ of error will not lie in such a case to remove the record
from the District Court into the Circuit Court for re-examination." p. 266. In this court it was argued that abundant provision was made for a review of such proceedings under the
supervisory power of the Circuit Court, and that a writ of
error was improper process; but we held it was clearly wrong
to dismiss the writ, and although we could not entertain jurisdiction of the cause, the Circuit Court not having passed upon
the merits, we sent it back with the suggestion that the Circuit
Court should, under the circumstances, "grant a rehearing and
reinstate the case, and proceed to decide the questions presented
on the bill of exceptions." It is true some stress was laid upon
the fact that there had been a trial by jury; but the point was
directly made and decided that the Circuit Court could use a
writ of error to bring the case up for review under its general
superintendence of bankruptcy proceedings. At that time we
had not decided that this court could not re-examine such
judgments of the Circuit Court, and that question was purposely left open; but Mr. Justice Clifford, in delivering the
opinion, said, "It is clear beyond doubt that the Circuit Court
erred in dismissing the writ of error for want of jurisdiction,
as it was the right of the excepting party to have the questions,
if duly presented by bill of exceptions, re-examined by the
Circuit Court." Since it is now settled that this re-examination must be had under the supervisory jurisdiction of that
court, this language is to be interpreted to mean, that when a
writ of error is employed as "process" for the purposes of
that jurisdiction, it will not deprive the court of its power to
proceed.
Looking to the writ in this case to see under what jurisdiction
it was issued, we find that it was in terms sent down to bring up
the record and proceedings in a certain matter pending in the
District Court sitting in bankruptcy, wherein the Globe Insurance Company was petitioning creditor and the Cleveland
Insurance Company was debtor. Thus it is apparent that the
proceeding to be reviewed was in bankruptcy, and not a suit

Oct. 1878.]

CLEVELAND

INs. Co. v.

GLOBE INS. CO.

371

at law or in equity. The only jurisdiction, therefore, appropriate to the relief which was asked was the supervisory jurisdiction; and as there is nothing in the form of the writ or
otherwise to manifest a contrary intent, it will be presumed
that the court actually proceeded under that jurisdiction in all
that was done. It follows that the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and that its judgment is final. The proceeding was one
which could only be re-examined under the supervisory jurisdiction, and the process employed to bring the case up was
proper under the circumstances. The record which went up
carried not only the bill of exceptions, but the entire proceedings below and all the testimony.
There is nothing in the case of Stickney v. Wilt (23 Wall.
150) at all in conflict with this. There, the suit in the District Court was one in equity, and not one in bankruptcy.
Such suits can only be taken to the Circuit Court for review
by appeal. The case was, however, prosecuted in the Circuit
Court, under its supervisory jurisdiction. This was distinctly
manifested throughout, and we held that as in that form of
proceeding the court had no jurisdiction whatever, we would
reverse its decree, and remand the cause with instructions to
dismiss the petition for review.
Here, however, the Circuit Court had jurisdiction, and over
its judgment we have no control.
The motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction will be
granted; and it is
So ordered.
Mr. JUSTICE CLIFFORD dissenting.

Jurisdiction of the district courts as courts of bankruptcy
extends to all acts, matters, and things to be done under and in
virtue of the bankruptcy, until the final distribution and settlement of the estate of the bankrupt and the close of the proceedings in bankruptcy. Rev. Stat., sect. 4972; 14 Stat. 518.
Circuit courts for each district of their respective circuits
have a general superintendence and jurisdiction of all cases and
questions arising in the district court for such district, when
sitting as a court of bankruptcy, which may be exercised by
the court in term time or in vacation by the circuit justice or

CLEVELAND INS.

[Sup. Ct.

by the circuit judge of the circuit; and the provision is that
such circuit court, circuit justice, or circuit judge may, in term
time or vacation, except when special provision is otherwise
made upon bill, petition, or other proper process of the party
aggrieved, hear and determine the case as in a court of equity.
14 Stat. 518; Morgan v. Thornhill, 11 Wall. 65.
Apart from those two provisions, the third clause of the second
section provides that circuit courts shall also have concurrent jurisdiction with the district courts of all cases at law or
in equity which may or shall be brought by the assignee in
bankruptcy against any person claiming an adverse interest, or
by such person against such assignee, touching any property or
rights of property of such bankrupt transferable to or vested
in such assignee. Smith v. Mason, 14 Wall. 419; Knight v.
]heney, 5 Nat. Bank. Reg. 805.
Petition in bankruptcy against the defendant company was
filed in the District Court by the corporation plaintiffs, and
they prayed that the defendant company may be declared
bankrupt, and that a warrant may be issued to take possession
of their estate. Due proceedings followed, and the District
Court sitting without a jury decided that the facts set forth in
the petition were not proved, and entered a decree dismissing
the petition.
Instead of petitioning the Circuit Court for a revision of the
ruling and decision of the District Court, under the first clause
of the second section of the Bankrupt Act, as the petitioners
should have done, they filed a bill of exceptions as in action at
law, and the same was signed and sealed by the district judge
as in the trial of an information for a seizure on land under
the ninth section of the Judiciary Act.
Application was then made by the original petitioners to the
Circuit Court for a writ of error to the District Court, which was
granted, and the cause was removed into the Circuit Court just
as when an action at law tried before a jury is removed from
the court of original jurisdiction into an appellate tribunal
pursuant to the common-law bill of exceptions, except that the
bill of exceptions contains the court's findings of fact as in
common-law cases where a jury is waived.
When the cause was entered and the transcript filed in the

Oct. 1878.]

CLEVELAND INS.

Co. v.

GLOBE INS. Co.

373

Circuit Court, the defendant company appeared and moved to dismiss the writ of error, for the following reasons : 1. Because the
proceeding being a petition in involuntary bankruptcy, where
the bankrupt did not demand a jury and the hearing had been by
the District Court, the case is not removable into the Circuit
Court by writ of error, but by petition for review or other
proper process under the first clause of the second section of
the Bankrupt Act. 2. Because the debt or damage claimed in
the petition does not amount to $500. 3. Because the writ of
error was not sued out within ten days after the entry of the
decision in the District Court.
Hearing was had; and the Circuit Court overruled the motion
to dismiss the writ of error, and reversed the decree of the District Court with costs, and ordered that a special mandate be
sent down to the District Court directing that court to carry the
judgment of the Circuit Court into execution and to adjudge the
defendant company bankrupt, as prayed in the petition, and to
proceed in the matter according to law. Exceptions were filed
by the defendant company, and they sued out the present writ
of error and removed the cause into this court.
Since the cause has been entered here, the plaintiff company
has filed a motion to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground
that no appeal lies to this court from a judgment or decree of
the Circuit Court exercising the supervisory jurisdiction conferred upon it by the first clause of the second section of the
Bankrupt Act. Morgan v. Thornhill, 11 Wall. 65; Smith v.
M3ason, 14 id. 419.
Both of these cases affirm that rule beyond all doubt, and the
same rule is confirmed by every subsequent case upon the same
subject; but the difficulty is, that the Circuit Court did not
exercise the supervisory jurisdiction which the first section of
the Bankrupt Act conferred. Jurisdiction under that clause
of -the second section of the act is usually exercised in pursuance of a petition for revision, and it must be exercised in some
mode of proceeding which will give the defending party the
right to answer the allegations of the pleading, as in a bill of
complaint, as is plainly to be inferred from the language of the
clause, else the hearing would be a mockery, as it would be
practically ex parte.

CLEVELAND INS.

Co.

v. GLOBE INS. CO.

[Sup. Ct.

Circuit courts are not courts of bankruptcy, nor have they
power to re-examine or review the rulings, decisions, or judgments of the district courts sitting in bankruptcy, except in
the cases and in the manner provided by the Bankrupt Act;
nor is it pretended that the Bankrupt Act gives the Circuit
Court any power whatever in a case like the present, to reexamine the decision or judgment of the District Court by a
writ of error.
Suppose the proceedings in the Circuit Court were in every
respect erroneous, leaving the losing party without remedy
unless the error can be corrected here, still it is insisted that
this court is without the power to grant relief. Cases wrongly
brought up, it may be admitted, should, as a general rule, be
dismissed by the appellate tribunal; but a necessary exception
exists to that rule where the effect of a judgment or decree of
dismissal will be to give full operation to an irregular and erroneous judgment or decree of the subordinate court in a case
where the judgment or decree of such a court is rendered without jurisdiction, or in violation of some legal or constitutional
right of the losing party.
Rules of practice are established to promote the ends of justice, and where it appears that a given rule will have the opposite effect from that which it was intended to accomplish, courts
of justice have never hesitated to establish an exception to it.
Appellate courts, where there is no defect in bringing up a
cause, usually affirm or reverse the judgment or decree of the
court below; but cases oecasionally arise where the proceedings
of the subordinate court are so unusual and irregular that the
appellate court can neither reverse nor affirm the merits of the
case without doing great injustice, and in such cases the appellate court never hesitates to remand the case for a new trial or
rehearing, first reversing the judgment or decree in order to
open the case for that purpose. Su!ydam v. Williamson et al.,
20 How. 427.
Where, as in a special verdict, the essential facts are not distinctly found by the jury, although there is sufficient evidence
to establish them, the court will not render a judgment upon
such an imperfect special finding, but will remand the cause
to the court below with directions to award a new venire.

So where the circumstances disclosed in the record rendered
it proper, in the view of the court, to remand the case for a
further hearing, the court decided to reverse the judgment, in
order that the rehearing might be granted. United States v.
Cambuston, 20 How. 59.
Admiralty cases have more than once been appealed to this
court in which it appeared that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction of the case, in consequence of irregularities in the District Court; and in such cases it has been held by this court
that it is the regular course to reverse the decree of the Circuit
Court, and to direct the Circuit Court to remand the cause to
the District Court for further proceedings.
Montgomery v.
Anderson, 21 How. 886; Mordecai v. Lindsey, 19 id. 199;
United States v. Galbraithet al., 22 id. 89.
Difficulties of the kind frequently occur in cases of seizures,
as the district courts have often failed to distinguish between
seizures on land and seizures on navigable waters. Mistakes of
a like kind have also been made in libels of information under
the confiscation acts. Where the seizure is on land, the rule
is that the case is triable according to the course of the common law; but seizures, when made on waters which are navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burthen, are
exclusively cognizable in the admiralty, subject to appeal to
the. circuit courts.

States, 1 Gall. 26; Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454; 8 Greeni.
Evid., sect. 896; 1 Kent, Com. (12th ed.) 304.
Want of jurisdiction in the court below, however, does not
prevent this court from assuming jurisdiction, on appeal, for
the purpose of reversing the decree rendered by the Circuit
Court in order to vacate any unwarranted proceedings necessarily standing in the way of the proper proceeding in a case
where, in the judgment of this court, other proceedings ought
to take place in consequence of the irregularity in either of the
subordinate courts. Where the court below has no jurisdiction
of the case in any form of proceeding, the regular course is to
direct the cause to be dismissed, if the judgment or decree of
the lower court is for the defendant or respondent; but if the

376

CLEVELAND INS.

CO.

v. GLOBE INS. CO.

[Sup. Ct.

judgment or decree is for the plaintiff or libellant, the court
here will reverse the judgment or decree, and remand the cause
with proper directions, as for example, to reverse the decree of
the District Court in a case where that court proceeded irregularly or without jurisdiction, and to remit the cause to the
District Court in order that the cause may be dismissed in the
court where the error commenced; or this court will reverse
the judgment or decree of the Circuit Court, and remand the
cause with directions to dismiss the case, or to grant a new
trial or rehearing, with or without leave to amend the pleadings, according to the circumstances of the case and as justice
may require. Morris's Cotton, 8 Wall. 507; Mail Company v.
Flanders,12 id. 130.
Nor did those decisions announce any new rule of practice,
as this court had in repeated instances decided in the same
way before that time. Union Insurance Co. v. United States,
6 id. 759; Amstrong's Foundry, id. 766.
Precisely the same question was presented in the case of
United States v. Hart (id. 722), where this court decided that
the proper disposition of the case was to reverse the decree,
and remand the cause to the court below with directions to
enter a decree remitting the case to the District Court, that
the case might be tried on the common-law side with a jury,
it appearing in that case that the seizure had been made on
land and not on waters navigable from the sea. The Brig
Caroline v. United States, 7 Cranch, 496; The Sarah, 8 Wheat.
391.
Unless the practice was as explained, great injustice would
be done in all cases where the judgment or decree in one or
both of the subordinate courts is erroneous and in favor of the
party instituting the suit, as he would obtain the full benefit of
a judgment or decree rendered in his favor by a court which
had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the controversy.
Common justice demands a strict adherence to this practice,
which requires that this court in all such cases will reverse the
judgment or decree of the lower court, and remand the cause
with proper directions either to dismiss the case or allow the
pleadings to be amended, or grant a new trial, or direct that the
cause be remitted to the District Court, as the circumstances

Oct. 1878.]

CLEVELAND INS.

Co. v.

GLOBE INS. CO.

377

of the case may require, in order that justice may be administered according to law.
Decided cases to that effect are numerous and decisive,
showing that the rule must be regarded as founded in the
settled practice of the court.
Beyond question, the general rule is that, where the Circuit
Court is without jurisdiction, it is irregular to make any order
in the cause except to dismiss the suit; but that rule does not
apply to the action of the court in setting aside such orders as
had been improperly made before the want of jurisdiction was
discovered, especially if it appears that the effect of the dismissal would be to leave the moving party in possession of judgment rendered without jurisdiction or authority of law. Mail
Company v. Flanders,12 Wall. 130.
In such cases, the writ of error or appeal gives jurisdiction
not only to dismiss the appeal, but also to remove all the hindrances to justice between the parties that have been created
by the irregular acts of the subordinate court, and which were
performed without jurisdiction or in violation of legal authority. Armstrong's Foundry, 6 id. 766.
Were it not so, the plaintiff would obtain the full benefit of
the judgment or decree in the case rendered in his favor by a
court which had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the controversy. Morris's Cotton, 8 id. 507.
Nor is it any answer of a satisfactory character to that obvious principle of justice to say that the Circuit Court would
have had jurisdiction of the cise if the party had petitioned
the Circuit Court under the first clause of the second section
of the Bankrupt Act, instead of resorting to the bill of exceptions and the common-law writ of error, as the conclusive reply
to that suggestion is that the case before the court was removed
by a writ of error from the District Court to the Circuit Court,
and every lawyer knows that the Circuit Court could not acquire any jurisdiction by that mode of proceeding to render
any valid decree in such a case.
Suppose that is so, then it follows that the dismissal of
the writ of error without reversing the decree of the Circuit
Court will leave the defendant company adjudged bankrupt by
a court which had no jurisdiction of the case, and without any

878

CLEVELAND INS.

Co. v.

GLOBE INS. 00.

[Sup. Ct.

remedy on the part of the company to avoid that erroneous
decree.
Argument to verify that proposition is quite unnecessary, as
the statement of the case shows that the Circuit Court granted
a writ of error to the District Court, as in an action at common
law, and having removed the cause from the District Court,
sitting as a court of bankruptcy, into the Circuit Court, reversed the decree of the District Court dismissing the petition
in bankruptcy, and issued a procedendo directing the District
Court to grant the prayer of the petition, all of which was
done as in an action at law; and the record shows that the
Circuit Court sent down its mandate to the District Court, as
in an action at law, directing the District Court to execute the
judgment rendered by the Circuit Court.
None of these proceedings are controverted, nor can they be;
from which it follows that, when the judgment of the court
dismissing the present writ of error is carried into effect, the
defendant company will stand adjudged bankrupt by the Circuit Court, which had no more power to render such a judgment than a State justice of the peace, as every lawyer
knows that the Circuit Court has no other jurisdiction than
what is conferred by an act of Congress, and that the Bankrupt Act confers no jurisdiction upon the circuit courts, in
that mode of proceeding, to reverse such a decree of the District Court.
Cases wrongly brought up, it may be admitted, should, as a
general rule, be dismissed by the appellate tribunal; but a
necessary exception exists to that rule where the consequence
of a dismissal will be to give full effect to an irregular and
erroneous decree of the subordinate court in a case where the
court was without jurisdiction, and acted in violation of some
legal or constitutional right of the party against whom the
decree was entered.
Serious embarrassment often arises in such cases where it
appears that the subordinate court is without jurisdiction; but
that difficulty does not prevent the court here from assuming
jurisdiction under the writ of error or appeal for the purpose
of reversing the judgment or decree rendered in the subordinate
court, in order to vacate the same, when rendered or passed

Oct. 1878.]

879

without authority of law. The Brig Caroline v. United States,
7 Cranch, 496; The Sarah, 8 Wheat. 891.
All other arguments failing, the attempt is made to show
that certain remarks of the court in the case of Insurance Company v. comstoc7c (16 Wall. 258) support the proposed judgment
of the court in the present case; but it is clear that no inference
of the kind can properly be drawn from the opinion of the
court in that case, for the plain reason that the court held that
mandamus was the proper remedy in that case, and dismissed
the writ of error solely upon that ground.
Prior to certain more recent decisions, it was an unsettled
question whether or not a writ of error would lie from the Circuit Court to the District Court, where, in a proceeding in
bankruptcy, the bankrupt demanded a trial by jury. Exceptions were taken in that case where the proceeding was in
bankruptcy, and the Circuit Court refused to decide the question. Hearing was had here; and this court was of the opinion
that mandamus was the proper remedy of the party, but did
not deem it necessary to issue the writ, as it was suggested
that the Circuit Court would at once conform to the views of
this court. Since that time, it has been decided that a writ of
error will not lie in such a case, which removes all doubt upon
the subject and every pretence of inconsistency in our former
decisions.
Wiswall et al. v. Campbell et al., 93 U. S. 847;
Hill v. Thompson, 94 id. 822.
Conclusive support to the proposition that nothing is to be
inferred from the case of Insurance Company v. Comstocc, to sustain the theory of the court in the present case, is found in the
subsequent decision of the court, which is reported in the same
volume. United States et al. v. JHucabee, 16 Wall. 414. In
that case the court say that usually, where a court has no
jurisdiction of a case, the correct practice is to dismiss the
suit; but a different rule necessarily prevails in an appellate
court in cases where the subordinate court was without jurisdiction, and has given a judgment or decree for the plaintiff, or
improperly decreed affirmative relief to a libellant. In such
cases the judgment or decree in the court below must be reversed, else the party which prevailed there will have the
benefit of the judgment or decree, though rendered by a court

[Sup. Ct.

which had no authority to hear and determine the matter in
controversy. United States et al. v. Huckabee, supra; (oit v.
Robinson, 19 Wall. 274.
Two cases are also reported in the twenty-third volume of
Wallace's Reports to the same effect, the opinion of the court
in the last of which was given by the present Chief Justice. In
the first case, the court say that where the court below has no
jurisdiction of the case in any form of proceeding, the regular
course, if the judgment or decree is for the defendant or respondent, is to direct the cause to be dismissed; but if the
judgment or decree is for the plaintiff or petitioner, the court
here will reverse the judgment or decree, and remand the cause
with proper directions, which, in the case supposed, must be to
dismiss the writ, libel, or petition, as the subordinate court cannot properly hear and determine the matter in controversy.
Viewed in the light of these suggestions, it is clear that the
decree of the Circuit Court should be reversed; and inasmuch
as that court has no jurisdiction of the subject-matter in that
form of proceeding, the directions should be that the writ of
error be dismissed.
Instead of a writ of error, an appeal was taken in the second
case, in which the Chief Justice said, that in order to sustain
the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in such a case, it must be
a case in equity arising under and authorized by the Bankrupt
Act, that a proceeding in bankruptcy from the time of its commencement by the filing of a petition to obtain the benefit of
the act, until the final settlement of the estate of the bankrupt,
is but one suit, and that the District Court, for all the purposes
of its bankruptcy jurisdiction, is always open, and that the only
remedy for the correction of errors in such cases is to be found
in the supervisory jurisdiction of the circuit courts under the
provisions of the first clause of the second section of the Bankrupt Act.
Corresponding views are expressed by the Chief Justice in
two later cases, both of which are reported in the regular
series of reports of the Supreme Court. Wiswall v. Campbell,
93 U. S. 348; Hill v. Thompson, 94 id. 322. Both of these
cases show to a demonstration that the Circuit Court, in reversing the decree of the District Court, acted without jurisdic-

tion; and yet the effect of the judgment of the court in this
case is to leave the judgment of the Circuit Court, rendered
without jurisdiction, in full force, which, in my judgment, is
error.
Six times, at least, the question in the case has been decided
by this court, without a dissent, which would seem to be a
sufficient justification of a member of the court who concurred
in all of the decisions for adhering to the rule which those cases
prescribe. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court should be reversed, and that the case
should be remanded to the Circuit Court with directions to
that court to dismiss the writ of error sued out from that court
to the District Court.

UNTTED STATES v. NEW ORLEANS.
1. The legislative branch of the government has the exclusive power of taxation, but may delegate it to municipal corporations.
2. When such corporations are created, the power of taxation is vested in them
as an essential attribute for all the purposes of their existence, unless its
exercise be in express terms prohibited.
3. When, in order to execute a public work, they have been vested with authority
to borrow money or incur an obligation, they have the power to levy a tax
to raise revenue wherewith to pay the money or discharge the, obligation,
without any special mention that such power is granted.
4. A limitation imposed by statute upon them, restraining them from creating
any indebtedness without providing at the same time for the payment of
principal and interest, will not control a subsequent statute, which, without
prescribing such limitation, authorizes them to incur a special obligation.
5. Bonds of the city of New Orleans, issued upon a subscription to the stock of
a railroad company, under an ordinance which declared that the stock
"should remain for ever pledged for the payment of the bonds," are an
absolute obligation of the city, the ordinance creating only a pledge of the
stock by way of collateral security for their payment.
6. The indebtedness of a city is conclusively established by a judgment recovered against it in a court of competent jurisdiction; and in enforcing
payment, the plaintiff is not restricted to any particular property or revenues, or subject to any conditions, unless such judgment so provides.
