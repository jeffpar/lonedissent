SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS, VS. ELIZABETH WIGGINS,
APPELLEE.
A grant of land by Estrada, the Governor of East Florida, was made on the 1st of August, 1815, to Elizabeth Wiggins, on her petition, st6ting, that "owing to the diminution of trade, she will have to devote herself to the pursuits of the country." The grant
was made for the quantity of land apportioned by the regulations of East Florida, to
the number of the family of the grantee. It was regularly surveyed by the surveyor
general, according to the petition and grant. No settlement or improvement was ever
made by the grantee, or by any one acting for heron the prbperty. In 1831, Elizabeth
Wiggins presented a petition to the Superior Courtof East Florida, praying for a confirmation of the grant; and in July, 1838, the Court gave a decree in favour of the
claimant. On an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, the decree of. the
Superior Court of East Florida was reversed. The Court held, that by the regulations
established on the 25th November, 1818, by Governor Coppinger, the grant had become
void, because of the non-improvement, and the neglect to settle the land granted.
The existence of a foreign law, especially when unwritten, is a fact to be proved like any
other fact, by appropriate evidence.
A copy of a decree by the governor of East Florida, granting land to a petitioner while
Spain had possession of the territory, certified by tle secretary of the government to have
been faithfully made from the original in the secretary's office, is evidence in the Courts
of the United States. By the laws of Spain, prevailing in the province at that time, the
secretary was the propler officer to give copies; and the law trusted him for this particular purpose, so far as he acted under its authority. The original was confined to the
public office.
The cases of Owings vs. Hull, 9 Peters, 624. Percheman's case, 7 Peters, 51, The
United States vs. Delespine, 12 Peters, 655, cited.
Prima facie evidence of a fact, is such, as in judgment of law is sufficient to establish the
fact, and if not rebutted, remains suffi6ient evidence of it. Kelly vs. Jackson, 6 Peters,
632, cited.
The eighth article of the Florida treaty stipulates that, "grants of land made by Spain in
Florida, after the 24th of January, 1818, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons
in possession of the land, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid if
the government of the territory had remained under the dominion of Spain." The
government of the Unijed States may take advantage of the non-performance of the
conditions prescribed bv the law relative to grants of land, if the treaty does not provide
for the omission.
In the cases of Arredondo, 6 Peters, 691, and Percheman, 7 Peters, 51, it was held, that the
words in the Florida treaty "shall be ratified and confirmed ;" in reference to, perfect
titles, should be construed, "are" ratified and confirmed. The object of the Court in
these cases was to exempt them from the operation of the eighth article, for that they
were perfect titles by the laws of Spain when the treaty was made; and that when the
soil and sovereignty of Florida were ceded by the second article, private rights of property were, by implication, protected. By the law of nations, the rights to property
are secured when territories are ceded; and to reconcile the eighth article of tile treaty
with the law of nations, the Spanish side of the article was referred to in aid of the
American gide. The Court held, that perfect titles, "stood confirmed" by the treaty;
and must be so recognised by the United States, in our Courts.
Perfect titles to lands, made by Spain in the territory of Florida before the 24th January,
1818, are intrinsically valid, and exempt from the provision of the eighth article of thie
treaty; and they need no sanction from the legislative or judicial departments of the
United States.
The eighth article of the Florida treaty was intended to apply to claims to land whose
validity depended on the pertiormance of conditions, in consideration of which the concessions had been made; and which must have been performed before Spain was bound
to perfect the titles. The United States were bound after the cession of the country, to
the same extent that Spain had been bound before the ratification of the treaty, to perfect
them by legislation and adjudication.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

APPEAL from the Superior Court of East Florida.
The appellee, Elizabeth Wiggins, on the 1st of August, 1815,
presented a petition to Estrada, the governor of East Florida, stating
that, "owing to the diminution of trade, she will have to devote
herself to the pursuits of the country;" and wishing to establish
herself on the eastern side of the pond of ' t. George, "she asked
the governor to grant three hundred acres in the said place, as she
had five children, hnd five slaves, with herself."
By a decree of the 6th of August, 1815, the object of the petition
was granted by Governor Estrada, and "a certified copy of this instance and decree," was ordered to be issued to the petitioner, "from
the secretary's office." A certified copy of these documents was given
to the petitioner, on the same day, by "Don Tomas De Aguilar."
A survey of the land was made by the surveyor general of the
province, on the 23d of March, 1821.

On the 26th of May, 1831,

Elizabeth Wiggins presented a petition to the judge of the Superior
Court of East Florida, stating her claim to three hundred acres of
land, granted to her by Governor Estrada, and praying that the
validity of the claim might be inquired into, and decided by the
Court, in pursuance of the acts of Congress.
The answer of the District Attorney of the United States to this
petition, denied the right of Elizabeth Wiggins to the land claimed
on many grounds. Those which were brought into examination,
and decided upon, were:
First, That the petitioner had never taken possession of or cultivated the land.
Second, The petitioner was required to make proof that a grant
for the land had been issued.
Third, That the petitione' having failed and neglected to occupy,
improve, or cultivate the land, and having abandoned it, the right
and title thereto, if any had existed, were wholly forfeited and lost.
Subsequently, a replication to the answer of the United States
was filed, and the original certified copy of the grant to Elizabeth
Wiggins of the' land, the same being certified by Tomas De Aguilar, secretary, &c., was offered in evidence by the claimant, and
was objected to by the United States.
The Court admitted the evidence.
By an amended bill, the petitioner also stated, that no condition
of settlement or improvement was contained in the grant of the
land; and that if any condition of settlement had been contained
in it, the unprotected situation of that part of East Florida from Indian depredations and aggressions, from the time of the grant to the
cession of the territory of Florida to the United States, had rendered it impossible to settle in that portion of the country with
safety to the persons or property of those who might venture so
to do.
The United States in an amended answer, set up in further opposition to the claim of the petitioner, the usage, practice, and custom,

S3G

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

of the government of Spain, which prevailed when the alleged grant
was made; that teiA years' occupancy and cultivation of the land,
under such'a grant, was necesIsary to give the grantee the title in
fee simple to the land. The United States stated other objections
to.the title claimed by the petitioner; and denied that the settlement
of the land was rendered dangerous by the disturbed state of.the

country.
The parties to the cause proceeded to take evidence in support and
in opposition to the claim of the petitioner; and the cause was heard
on the documents and evidence. At July term, 1838, the Superior
Court made a decree confirming. the title of. Elizabeth Wiggins to
the land claimed by- her. From this decree the United States took
an appeal to this Court.
The case was argued by Mr. Gilpin, Attorney General, and Mr.
Dent, for the United States; and by Mr. Downing; for the appellee.
Mr. Gilpin, for the United States.
This is one of a numerous class of cases which has of late years
repeatedly claimed the consideration of this Court. The rule laid
down by the late Chief Justice is one that should be recognised
whenever they ard" discussed: that "it wopld violate the usage of
nations, and outrage the sense of justice, to annul private rights."
To protect these is the duty of this Court ;-and it was also unquestionably the desire and object of the executive government, when it
made the treaty with Spain. The eighth article of that treaty was
adopted after much discussion and change; and these discussions
turned mainly on the provisions which were to guard private and
existing interests. But, on the other hand; fraud is to be prevented;
the public domain, of which the acquisition was costly, is to be protected; opportunities of deception growing out of the change of
dominion are to be Watched; titles-are to be saved from embarrassment and conflict; and the regulations made imperative on the landholder, by the Spanish laws, are not to be wantonly relaxed. The
Spanish land law in Florida was one of great liberality; occupation
and cultivation formed the only price which the government required
from its grantees; but this price it did absolutely require. While,
therefore, we sacredly uphold every vested right, and reserve to
every citizen of Florida the privileges he derived under the Spanish
law, we must exact of him proof of a compliance with the conditions that law imposed, before we allow him the benefit of its pri
vileges. We have no right to tolerate what would facilitate or
sanction fraud or unjustifiable negligence.
The Spanish government would not, in its most liberalspirit, have
confirmed to the present claimant the grant of land she now seeks
to obtain. Her claim is founded on a concession of three hundred
acres, alleged to have been given by Governor Estrada, in 1815,
and to have been surveyed in 1821 ; but never, as is admitted, possessed or cultivated to this day. Two inquiries, thereforep.present

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

337

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

themselves: first, whether such a concession was ever made in point
of fact; and secondly- whether, if it was not, the-acts of the claimant since have been such as now to authorize its confirmation.
1. That no such concession was ever granted by Governor Estrada may be inferred from the fact that none was ever produced
or exhibited until the year 1833, eighteen years after it purports to
have been made. The claim itself first appears in the report of the
register and receiver, dated in January, 1827, twelve years after the
alleged grant. Even then it is sustained only by an alleged certificate of survey, dated on the 23d March, 1821, purporting to have
been made by the surveyor general, Clarke, six years after the grant,
in face of the Spanish law, which required the possession to be taken
within six months after the date of the grant. There was no evidence
of occupation or cultivation; none of the existence of the concession
now relied on; its existence was not even alleged till the year 1833;
the claim up to. that time was admitted to rest on the certificate of
survey by Clarke, which, if genuine, was made by him in direct
violation of the Spanish land law.
But, independent of the stro-g inferences resulting from these circumstances, the documentary title now set up is inadmissible as
legal evidence. No original paper is exhibited; of the concession
we have merely a copy certified by Aguilar, the governor's secretary; of the certificate of survey we have merely a copy certified by
the keeper of the public -archives. No evidence is offered to show
that either of these papers ever existed. Aguilar, the person who
copied the concession, is not produced; Clarke, the surveyor general, who is examined, does not prove either the concession or his
own certificate of the survey; Alvarez, a clerk in Aguilar's office at
the time, never saw or heard of the original concession; Cavedo,
a clerk in ' 3 record office, knows nothing of it; no evidence of its
existence, and consequentl( of its loss or destruction, appears throughout the record.
To supply the want of this, the claimant attempts to establish a
presumption of loss, by alleging that the documents in the i'ecord
office were sQ carelessly kept as to make' the loss of these papers
very probable. Bit this allegation is quite inconsistent with the
testimony before this Court. The papers are shown, at all events,
to have been carefully kept from 1815 to 1821; yet Alvarez, who
kept them, and constantly examined them, never saw such a concession; in 1821, the r6turn of the survey must have led .him to
recur to it, if in existence: the surveyor general, who was well acquainted with the office papers, neVer-saw it: in a list of documents
made soon after the change of flags, neither the concession nor certificate of survey is alluded to. These circumstances, taken in connexion with the fact that the concession was never relied on by the
claimant till 1833, are inconsistent with the presumption of existence
and loss. Nor is this all ; thee is evidence which goes far to raise
a contrary presumption : the loss of no grant from these archives
has been alleged, except such as now depend on copies certified by
VOL. XIV.--2 F

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

Aguilar; and evidence was offered to prove,'that, in two cases at
least, he had proposed to forge, or did actually forge, documents of
a similar charac, er; although this evidence, being objected to by the
claimant, was no doubt properly rejected, yet it forms a strong circumstance, taken in connexion with the rest, to authorize a presumption that there never was any original concession.
Admitting, however, the facts on which the claimant presumes
this loss, yet they can have no weight, as legal evidence, without
previous proof that the document in question did actually exist.
Satisfactory testimony that the original existed, is absolutely neces7sary before the certified copy can be admitted. In the case of
Goodier vs. Lake, 1 Atkyns, 446, Lord Hardwicke required, not
merely that the existence but the genuineness of a note, alleged to
be lost, should be shown before a copy was admitted ; and in that
of Irwin vs. Simpson, 7 Bro. Parl. Cases, 317, an office copy of a
bill was rejected, though an officer of the. Court was ready to prove
that the original could not be found, after a search among the records.
In the case of Cauffman vs. The Congregation of Cedar Springs,
6 Binney, 63, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held, that, in
order'to prove the substance of a writtehi agreement, evidence of its
existence must be first given, and then that it was lost or destroyed.
So in the case of Meyer vs. Barker, 6 Binney, 237, the same Court
say, that before secondary evidence of the contents of a written instrument can be given, "there must be proof that such instrument
This rule has been repeatonce existed, and is lost or destroyed."
edly recognised by other judicial tribunals; Jackson vs.Todd, 3 Johns.
Rep. 304; Spencer vs. Spencer, I Gallison, 624: and, in this Court,
distinct proof that a lost deed had been in possession of a person to
whom it properly belonged, was regarded as a necessary ground for
the admission of'secondary evidence of its contents. Minor vs. Tillotson, 7 Peters, 101. The present claimant offers no direct -testimony whatever of the existence of her concession. The only evidence in fact is, that a copy of it is referred to in the certificate of
survey; but even of that certificate of survey nothing but a copy is
produced. Clearly, the case is not brought within the well established rule.
It is contended, however, that the rule in question does not apply
where the originals are placed in a public office, and the office is
allowed by law to give to the parties certified copies. To this it is
answered, in the first place, that this exception does not in any case
dispense with direct proof of the, original having existed; but, in the
second place, it is never applicable in a case where the genuineness
of the original iscontested. In the case of the United States vs.
Percheman, 7 Peters, 84, where the question arose in regard to the
admission of these certificates, it was declared by the Court, in admitting them, that the original must be produced, if either party
should suggest the necessity of so doing. In the case of Minor vs.
Tillotson, 7 Peters, 101, it was held, that wherever suspicion hung
over the instrument, the copy was not to be admitted without rigid

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

339

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

inquiry. In the case of the United States vs, Jones, 8 Peters, 382,
it was held, that although a certified treasury transcript of documents filed in the public offices, is made, by law, of equal validity
with the originals, yet the defendant is at liberty to impeach the evidence thus certified, and, on allegation of fraud, require the production of the original. In the case of 0wings vs. Hull, 9 Peters, 626,
where the copy of a bill of sale in Louisiana was admitted, it was
done upon the express ground that the original was in the possession
of the notary. In the case of Winn vs. Patterson, 9 Peters, 675, it
was held, that there must be satisfactory proof of the genuineness
and due execution of a power of attorney, before a copy from the
public office of the recorder could be received. In the case of the
United States vs. Delespine, 12 Peters, 656, the extent to which these
certificates of Florida concessions were to be admitted, as evidence,
was discussed; and their admission was made to depend upon the
fact that there was positive proof of the existence of the original
concession, in the office of the secretary who gave the certificate.
This case, therefore, is not excepted from the common law rule,
making proof of the existence of the original necessary, by the fact
that its deposit in a public office was required.
It is however contended, that by the usages recognised in the
Spanish law, the certificate is.evidence without proving the existence of the priginal. No authority has been cited on this point;
no law, order, receipt, or judicial decisioi to that effect, has been
exhibited. The claimant relies on the parol evidence of a few persons in Florida, to prove what, if it exists, must be a well settled rule
in the judicial tribunals of Spain. This is not a matter of.mere local
usage, which is to be established like an ordinary fact. But taking
the parol testimony in the record, it will be found, that in every
instance where the Witnesses speak of a certified copy of a concession being of equal validity with the original, they explain themselves as referring to cases where the original is known or proved to
.exist. Alvarez, the principal witness of the claimant on this point,
says, that "he does not recollect a certified copy of a grant being
received in evidence in a Spanish Court of justice, where the original was not on file in the proper office ; and from his knowledge
of the practice of the government, he does not believe that such a
copy would be received in evidence in a Spanish Court, uinless the
party could prove that the original was in the office at the time the
copy was made."'
On these grounds, it is submitted that there is no evidence of this
concession ever having been made; but a strong presumption
against it.
2. If, however, the original concession is proved, still the claimant
is not entitled to a confirmation of it, because she performed none of
the conditions which were required to perfect her title by the Spanish
law.
Grants of land in Florida, by the Spanish authorities, so far as

340

SUPREME COURT.

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]
they have come before this Court, appear to have been of three
classes.
First. Absolute grants, in consideration of services already performed, which were made' by the governors, in special cases, either
by virtue of a special power recognised by the laws of the Indies, (2
White's New Recopilacion, 38. 40. 52 ;) or by the authority given, in
particular decrees, coming directly or indirectly from the sotereign, as
in.Je-case of the grants conferred upon Salus, Paujin, and Percheman,
in reward for their services. 2 White's New Rec. 280. The very
nature of these grants forbids a limitation on the quantity, or on the
consideration that might move them. They are recognised by this
Court in the cases of the United States vs. Percheman, 7 Peters, 97;
and United States vs. Clarke, 8 Peters, 453.
Second. Grants in consideration of services to be performed, and
deemed specially important for the improvement of the province.
These do not seem to have grown out of-any law or royal order, but
were not infrequent for some years before the cession of Florida.
They were, established by usage, and recognised as lawful. 2
White's New Recopilacion, 386. 289, 290. The services appear
to have been of three kinds the eiection of saw mills, factories, or mechanical works; the introduction and rearing of large
numbers of cattle; and the establishment in particular places of
large bodies of settlers. The titles to these were, in some instances,
absolute on their face, and conveyed a present grant from their date,
though coupled with conditions for the subsequent performance of
the specified services; or they were mere concessions or incipient
grants, securing a future absolute title, on the performance of the
conditions. The first are recognised by this Court, in the cases of
United States vs. Arredondo, 6 Peters, 745, 746. United States vs.
Clarke,
Peters, 441. 467. United States vs. Sibbald, 10 Peters,
313; and8 others.
The second, in the cases of United States vs.'Mills,
12 Peters,,215, and United States vs. Kingsley, 12 Peters, 477. 486.
Third. But the great class of cases was that of gratuitous grants, in
moderate quantities, for purposes of actual occupation and cultivation. To this class is applicable the general system of Spanish land
law which existed in Florida and Louisiana; and the regulations
embraced under it are as clear and distinct as those of the land laws
of the United States. It is true, the grantswere gratuitous, but the
performance of the conditions annexed by that law, was a consideration as explicit as the payment required by our laws.
The regulations in regard to these grants are first found in the
compilation of the laws of the Indies, promulgated by the Spanish
sovereign in 1682. By those laws, grants were distributed by the
governors to settlers, on condition that they should take actual possession of the lands granted in three months, and build upon and
cultivate them; and after four years of such occupation, they were
entitled to hold the land in absolute property. 2 White's New Rec
48. 50, 51. The incipient grant, termed a concession, was deposited

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

341

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

in the office of the governor's secretary; but, on proof of the necessary occ 'patioln and cultivation, the settler received an absolute
grant, or, as it was called, a royal title, which was recorded in the
office of the escribano, or notary of the province. 2 White's New
Rec. 283. The quantity to be given to each settler is not prescribed
in the laws of the Indies, but the governors are directed to graduate
it. These regulations are subsequently recognised 'by the King of
Spain, in his royal orders of 1735, 1754, and 1768, (2 White's New
Rec. 62. 64. 71 ;) and in the latter it is declared, that " where any
shall not apply themselves in a proper manner to improve the lands
allotted to them, the same shall be taken from them, (which I
do without mercy,) and granted to others who shall fulfil the conditions." In 1770, O'Reilley, the Governor of Louisiana, promulgated
his regulations, fixing two hundred and forty arpcns as the quantity
of a concession for a family, and allowing an absolute title, in the
name of the king, after three years' cultivation and improvement,
to be ascertained after strict inquiry. 2 White's New Rec. 229,230.
In 1790, under the administration of Governor Quesada, in East
Florida, and pursuant to a royal order, dated the 29th November,
1789, we have the quantity allotted to the settlers in that province
specifically designated; one hundred acres are assigned to each head
of a family, and fifty to each other person composing it, whether
white or black; provision is also made, that foreign emigrants shall
first, take an oath of allegiamice to Spain; the surveyor general is
required to inform the settlers that they will obtain their concessions
or incipient titles from the governo. 's secretary ; and also, to give
them express notice that the conditions prescribed by law must be
completed, before they can receive an absolute title. 2 White's
New Rec. 276. 1 Clarke's Land Laws, 996-99S. In 1797, Governor Gayoso, in Louisiana, enlarged the allotment to two hundred
acres for the head of the family, fifty acres for each child, and twenty
for each negro; he required possession to be taken within one year,
and gave an absolute title after three years' cultivation. 2 White's
New Rec. 233. In 1799, Governor Morales declared, explicitly,
that notwithstanding the concession, or first grant, by which the settler obtained possession, he was "not to be regarded as the owner
of the land until his royal title was delivered complete." 2 White's
New Rec. 239. In 1803, Governor White, in East Florida, reduced.
the allotment to fifty acres for the head of the family, twenty-five
acres to each child and slave above the age of sixteen years, and
fifteen acres to.each that was younger; he declared that "every
concession, in which no time was specified, should be null, if polsession and cultivation were not commenced within six months."
He also required ten years' possession before an absolute or royal
title was granted; and decreed, that if, in any case, the land was
abandoned for two years, the title should be absolutely void. 2
White's New Rec. 259. 277. 278. 281. In 1811, Governor Estrada
solicited permission to change these regulations, and to be allowed
to sell the lands absolutely for money, in lieu of granting them gra2 r2

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

tuitously on conditions of cultivation and settlement; but all chdnga
in the system was explicitly refused. 2 White's New Rec. 266
267. In 1813, the Cortes, under the new Spanish constitution,.
passed an ordinance authorizing such sales, but this was repealed
the next year, and the previous laws and regulations were restored,
Clarke's Land Laws, 1007. 1010. 8 Peters, 455. With this partial exception, (which does not appear to have been acted on in
practice,) the regulations of Governor White continued in full force
till 1815, when Governor Kindelan, on account of the Indian disturbance, relaxed them so far as to grant absolute titles to settlers
who had actually built houses and improved their lands, though the
ten years' settlement was not complete. 2 White's New Rec. 288.
In 1818, Governor Coppinger, at the instance of Garrido, an agent
of the Duke of Alagon, directed a full investigation and review of
the land syste6 of Florida to be made; aid the report of Saavedra,
which was sanctioned by the governor, fully establishes the regula •
tions which have been cited, as then in existence ; whether they relate to the absolute grants, the grants upon express condition, or the
gratuitous concessions for purposes of settlement and cultivation.
2 White's New Rec. 282. 288.
The claimant's title in this case rests on a concession of Governor
Estrada of three hundred acres ; not asked or granted for any services, but because "she has five children and five slaves, with herself." This entitled her to three hundred acres. At that time the
regulations of Governor White were in full force. She never occupied the land or cultivated it, at any time from the date of the
concession to the present day. It cannot be doubted but that under
the Spanish law, "her concession is of no value or effect, the prescribed conditions not having been complied with, nor can she by
means of it claim any right to the land granted, which should now
be considered vacant."
These are the words of Saavedra.
2 White's New Rec. 283.
But it is said the eighth article of the treaty between Spain and
the United States, ceding Florida, recognises this as a valid and existing title, because there is no condition expressed in it. The treaty
declares, that " Spanish grants, made before the 24th January, 1818,
shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the
lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, if
the territories had remained under the dominion of Spain." 6 Laws
of the United States 618. 2 White's New Rec. 210. The meaning of this article has been fully canvassed and settled by this Court.
In the case of the United States vs. Arredondo, (6 Peters, 741,) it
was held, that under the treaty, and without the necessity of any
further act by the United States, all complete and absolute titles then
existing, " st6od confirmed ;" and this decision was repeated in the
case of the United States vs. Percheman, 7 Peters, 89. But all
grants which wei e not complete and absolute, could only bd made
valid by the legislation of. the United States. The question, then,
resolves itself into this: has any legislation, in pursuance of this

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

343

[The United States v. Wiggins.]

treaty, given validity to a concession or imperfect title, where the
grantee had not performed the conditions required by the Spanish
law, to make the grant valid? The first act, that of 8th May, 1822,
(3 Story's Laws, 1870,) directs an examination by commissioners
into the fact, whether the claim presented was valid, "agreeably to
the laws and ordinances previously existing of the governments
making the grant." The act of 3d March,'1823, (3 Story's Laws,
1907,) recognises and directs the same inquiry. The act of 28th
February, 1824, (3 Story's Laws, 1935,) makes it incumbent on the
claimant to establish, that "the conditions required by the laws and
ordinances of the Spanish government," shall have been complied
with. And the act of 23d May, 1828, (4 Story's Laws, 2124,) which
finally submits the claims to a judicial decision, restricts them by
the rule prescribed in the act of the 26th May, 1824, (3 Story's
Laws, 1959,) to such as "might have been perfected into a complete
title under and in conformity to the laws, usages, and. customs of
the government, under which the same originated.',. While, therefbre, a complete and perfect grant is recognised as valid, without
inquiring into the fact, how far it had been duly made ;:it is apparent
that neither by the treaty, nor by the legislation of Congress, is an
inceptive or imperfect grant confirmed, unless it might have been
perfected under the laws and.usages of Spain. It has been shown
that the present claim could not have been so perfete, but that it
was, and is, absolutely null; and "the land granted should now be
considered as vacant."
Nor can any decision of this Court be shown which goes to establish such a claim; no case exactly similar has come before it; but
so far as the principles heretofore laid down, are applicable to it, it
submitted that they sustain, the ground now taken, on behalf of the
United States. If so, the decision of the Court below was erroneous, and the claim of the appellee should be rejected; even if it be
admitted that th6 proof of the existence of the original concession
is sufficient.
* Mr. Downing, for the appellee, contended,
1. That this copy is full and sufficient prodf of the grant: First,
by the Spanish laws.and usages; and, second, by the common law
of England, adopted in Florida, as primary evidence before the
Spanish Court-as secondary and sufficient before ours.
2. That the absence of the original from the archives, is accounted
for by the carelessness with which the papers were kept; and does
not furnish a presumption that it never existed.
The appellee may safely rest her case on the authority of the
cases decided by this Court, as to the proof of the grant from Governor Estrada. A certified copy of the grant is presented, and this
is the only paper a claimant of land in East Florida can have -The

of the government. Certified copies, which serve as titles, are issued
.by the government. This was the practice in all such cases.
The question before the Court is upon the validity of the certifi
cate of title.
As to the performance of the condition of settlement, it has been
repeatedly held, by this Court, it is a condition subsequent' and does
not affect the validity of the grant. 10 Peters, 321. But in the
grant to Elizabeth Wiggins, there is no condition of settlement.
It has always been contended in Florida, that even if there is a
condition of settlement in the grant, the forfeiture is to be enforced
by the government: and until this is done, the grant is in full'operation. No case is known in which the forfeiture has been claimed.
Grants of this description were made as inducements to settlements
and improvements The government required an agricultural population, to increase the safety of the whole community from Indian
depredations. Grants of land were freely given, when offers of settlement were made; but no rigid exaction of penalties followed the
failure of the grantee to execute the purposes of improvement and
settlement.
This Court, in the case of Percheman, have decided upon the
legality of the certified copy of the petition and grant, as evidence.
In other cases, the same decision has been made. 12 Peters, 655.

CERTIFICATE OF AGUILAR.

"I, Don Tomas de Aguilar, sub-lieutenant of the army, and secretary of the government of the place and province of East Florida,
for his majesty, do certify that the preceding copy is faithfully drawn
from the original which exists in the. secretary's office, under my
charge,.and pursuant to the order I give the present,. in St. Augustine of Florida, on the sixth of August, one thousand eight hundred
and fifteen.

ToMAs DE AGUILAR."

Before the memorial and concession were offered in evidence,
Elizabeth Wiggins made affidavit: 'That, in August, 1815, she
petitioned for the grant; that she received shortly after from the
secretary of the government, a certified 'opy of the petition and
, decree; that she never had had possession or control of the original;
that she always understood that it was, at the date thereof, placed in
the proper public office, as was usual in such cases; that she understood from her counsel the same could not be found; and that she
is ignorant what has become of the same."
The affidavit was'objected to, on the part of the United States, and
rejected by the Court, and the evidence offered received without its
aid; on proof being made of the handwriting of Aguilar, the government secretary.
Much evidence was introduced to prove the, practice and rules in
use in the offices of the Spanish government, from which titles to
lands issued We think the evidence was admissible; the existence
of a foreign law, especially when unwritten, is a fact to be proved,
like any other fact, by appropriate evidence. The Spanish province of -Florida, was foreign to this country in 1815, when the
transaction referred to purports to have taken place.
A principal witness to prove the practice in the government Secre-

tary's office, was Alvarez, who had been a clerk in it from 1807, to
the time of the change of government, in 1821. lie, and others,
establish beyond controversy, that persons wishing grants of land
from the Spanish government, presented a memorial to the governor,
and he decreed on the memorial, in the form pursued in Mrs. Wiggins' case; that the decree of the governor was filed in the secretary's office, and constantly retained there, unless, in cases where
a royal title was ordered to be issued, when the decree was trans-

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

ferred to the escribano's office. Mrs. Wiggins' is a case of the first
class; and the petition and decree could not be removed from the
government secretary's office. These papers were not recorded in
books there, but kept in files or bundles.
The evidence given to the grantee, was a certified copy of the
decree, or of the memorial and decree, by the government secretary;
and that it was one of the ordinary duties of the secretary to make
certified copies of memorials and decrees for the use of the parties.
Generally, the decree of the governor directed the copy to be made
for the use of the party; and that copies made by the government
secretary, and certified by him, were generally received as evidence
of title in the Spanish Courts of justice; the copies were made immediately after making the decree, and delivered to the party when
he called for them. No seal was affixed to ihe secretary's certificate; which was evidence of the facts to which it certified, in a case
like this. From the evidences of the duties incumbent on the
government secretary of Florida, derived from this record, and other
sources, we have no doubt the duties were such as proved; that
the secretary was the proper officer appointed by law to give copies;
and that the law trusted him, for this particular purpose, so far as
he acted under its authority. It follows, in this case, as in all others
where the originals are confined to a public office, and copies are
introduced, that the copy is (first) competent evidence by authority
of the certificate of the proper officer : and (second) that it proves,
prima facie, the original to have been of file in the office, when the
copy was made. And for this plain reason: the officer's certificate
has accorded to it the sanctity of a deposition : he certifies, "that
the preceding copy is faithfully drawn from the original, which
exits in the secretary's office, under my charge."
The same doctrine was holden in this Court in Owings vs. Hull,
9 Peters, 624, 625. The copy of a bill of sale for slaves, made and
of record in a notary's office, in New Orleans, was offered in evidence, without accounting for the original ; and objected to for this
reason. By the laws of Louisiana, the, riginal could not .be removed from the notary's office; and le'was authorized to give a
copy. This was received and deemed evidence of what was contained in the original; and, of course, that it existed when the copy.'
was made.
Again, in Percheman's case, (7 Peters, 85,) it was decided t)y
this Court, that a copy of a Spanish grant, certified by the government secretary, could he given in evidence without accounting for the
nonproduction of the original; and this, on general principles;
which did not require the aid of legislation: much reliance in that
case having been placed upon acts of Congress to give-effect to the
certificate.
This Court, in the United States vs, Delespine, (12 Peters, 655,)
recognised the principle, that a certified copy, such as the one before us, was evidence, for there a copy of the first copy was introduced: and when speaking of the first cony, the Court say, "the

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

347

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

first copy was .made from the original filed in the proper office,
from which the original could not be removed for any purpose.
That copy, it is admitted, would have been, evidence in the cause."
The original copy having been lost, and no decree being found in
the government secretary's office in favour of Delespine, although
there was proof that one had existed, the copy of the first copy
was received, and a decree founded on it.
Delespine's case is, however, prominently distinguished from the
present on the main point in comtroversy ; in that case, there was
positive proof of the existence in the secretary's oice of the original concession; here there is none, save the inference that arises
from Aguilar's certificate, with some other circumstances: and the
question is, can a decree for the land be founded upon these proofs;
in the face of the fact, that no decree, or evidence of the claim now.
exists, or has ever been known to exist in the proper office.
We have established that the copy of the petition and decree are
made prima facie evidence by the certificate of the secretary. "What
is such as, in judgment of law,
is prima facie evidence of a fact? lIt
is sufficient to establish the fact ; and, if not rebutted, remains sufficent for the purpose." Kelly vs. Jackson, 6 Peters, 632. And is
it rebutted in this case ? Had the papers in the government secretary's office been carefully kept; and had this claim been first
brought forward at a late day, as it is insisted in argument it was,
(that is, eighteen years after its date,) then the presumption would
stand against its original existence; and it ought to be rejected, if the
certificate had no support. But this is far from being the fact. The
survey was made by the proper surveyor, for Mrs. Wiggins, March
23d, 1821, in conformity to the memorial and decree, and, which
refers to their date. Then again she pursued this claim before the
register and receiver of the land-cffice of East Florida, whilst they
acted as a board of commissioners for the examination of Spanish
claims and titles; and they rejected it because there was no evi.
dence of cultivation. Truly, the certificate and plot of the survey
were only before them; but as no exception appears to have been
taken, for want of sufficient evidence of the existence of the concession, the circumstance of the nonproduction of it before the
board, has not so much in it as was supposed in the argument.
The record shows why such vigorous exertions were made, either
to reject or to destroy the force of Aguilar's certificate. The a'ttoYney for the-government offered to prove by William G. Davis, that
Aguilar, just' before the delivery of the province was made to the
United States, offered to forge a grant, in favour of the witness, for
a tract of land ; and the attorney also offered to prove by William
Levington, that about the same time, Aguilar offered to forge, or
did actually forge, under the signature of the former governor,
'White, of that province, a grant of land in favour of the witness ;
which evidence the Court rejected; and, we thitk, correctly. Aguilar was not introduced as a witness; but the proof offeredsought
to establish upon him forgery and fraud in other instances, so as to

348

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

destroy the credit of his certificate in this. The secretary may have
been honest and faithful in the discharge of his duties in 1815, and
grossly tei reverse k, 1821; and although any number of frauds
should be established upon him, still, if the particular act sought to
be avoided be not-shown to be tain'ted with fraud, it cannot be affected with other frauds. 4 Peters, 297. If there had been a forgery in this instance, it is probable it would have been brought to
light at the time the survey was made: the making of which is the
controlling fact with this Court, coming in aid of the certificate of
Aguilar. For it must be admitted, that if the unsupported certificate
had been brought forward, and the claim for the first time set up
under it, in July, 1833, eighteen years after it bears date; that it
could not have furnished any-foundation for a decree, or been evidence of title worthy of credit. The lapse of time, the silence of
the claimant, and her failure to have presented it for confirmation,
would, under the circumstances, have been conclusive objections to
its credibility. But the existence of the claim in 1821, is reidered
certain by the return of the surveyor general; and before the American tribunals it has been steadily pursued.
Furthermore, the presumption that the original memorial and
concession, supposed to have been on file in the government secretary's office, have been lost or destroyed, is very strong. After the
papers were taken possession of in 1821, by the -authorities cf the
United States, they were almost abandoned, in an open house, subject to the inspection and depredation of every one; many of the
files were seen untied, and the papers scattered about the room; the
doors and windows of the house being open. There can hardly be
a doubt that some of the papers were destroyed or lost.
Nothing is therefore found in the condition of the office, to rebut
thQ prima facie presumption furnished by the secretary's certificate ;
as might bQ the case, had the papers been kept with proper care:
and especially, had the concessions been numbered, and no number
been missing.
The next question is, does the concession carry with it the conditions imposed by law on those having lands given to them-for the
purposes of settlement? The object of the applicant, Mrs. Wiggins,
is distinctly set forth by her memorial; with the numbef of the
family of which she was the head, that 's, five children and five
slaves, with herself. By the regulation,-of Governor White, published in 1803, it vps declared,dhat to each head of a family there
should be distributed fi.fty acres; and to the children and slaves, sixteen years of age, twenty-five acres for each one;, but from the age
of eight to sixteen years, only fifteen acres.
Taking the slaves and children all to have been over sixteen,
there being ten of them, would have entitled the applicant to two
hundred and fifty acres on their account, and the fifty acres on her
own; which would have made up the three hundred acres applied
for.
The same ordinance provides, "That those employed in the city,

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

349

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

if lands be granted to them for cultivation, by themselves or their
slaves; it shall be with the express condition, that he shall commence
cultivation within one month after the concession of them, with the
understanding, that if they do not do it, they will be granted to any
one who will denounce him, and verbally prove it." And that all
concessions, without time specified, shall be void, and held as
tho-ugh not made, if grantees do not appear to take possession and
cultivate them within the term of six months.
In the concessiou to Mrs. Wiggins, no time is specified for the
settlement; and the government of the United States may take advanta e of the nonperformance of the condition prescribed by law, if
the eighth article of the treaty with Spain does not provide for the
emission. It stipulates, "that grants 16f lands made by Spain, before
the 24th of January, 1818, shall be ratified and confirmed to the
persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same
grants would be valid, if the territories had remained under the dominion of Spain."
. It was adjudged by this Court, in the cases of Arredondo and
Percheman, 6 and 7 Peters, that the words "shall be ratified and confirmed," in reference to perfect titles, should be construed to meal
"are" ratified and confirmed, in the present tense. The object of
the Court in these cases was to exempt them from the operation
of the eighth article, for the reason that they were perfect titles by
the laws of Spain, when the treaty was made; and. that when the
soil and sovereignty of Florida were ceded by the second article,
private rights of property were by implication protected. The
Court, in its reasoning, most justly held that such was the rule by
the laws of nations, even in cases of conquest, and undoubtedly so
in a case cf concession: therefore, it would be an unnatural construction of the eighth article, to hold that perfect and complete titles,
at the date of the treaty, should be subject to investigation and confirmation by this government; and to reconcile the article with the
law of nations, the Spanish side of the article was referred to, in aid
of the meaning of the American side, when it was ascertained that
the Spanish side was in the present tense: whereupon the Court
held, that the implication resulting from the second article, being
according to the law of nations, that, and the eighth article, were
consistent; and that perfect titles "stood confirmed" by the treaty;
and must be so recognised by the United States, and in our Courts.
The construction of the, treaty being settled, a leading inquiry in
the, cases referred to was, were they perfect, unconditional Spanish
grants ?
Percheman's had no condition in it; and the only difficulty involved was, whether it had been made by the proper authority.
The Court held it had been so made.
The grant to Arredondo and son was for four leagues square, and
made as a present grant from its date; with the subsequent condition that the grantees should settle and improve the land in three
VOL. XIV.-2 G

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wiggins.)

years, and on failure, the grant should become void: further, that
they should sfttle'on it two hundred Spanish families; but no time
was fixed for the performance of this condition. Possession was
taken and improvements made within the three years; but the
families were not settled when the, country was ceded. This Court
declared, that after the cession of Florida to the United States, the
condition of settling Spanish families had become, probably, impossible, by the acts of the grantor, the goverfiment of Spain; and certainly immaterial to the United States: therefore, the grant was discharged from the unperformed conditiop, and single.
That the perfect titles, made by Spain, before the 24th of January,
isis, within the ceded territory, are intrinsically valid, and exempt
from the provisions of the eighth article, is the established doctrine
of this Court; and that they need no sanction from the legislative or
judicial departments of this country.
But that there were at the date of the treaty very many claims,
whose validity depended upon the performance of conditions in
consideration of which the concessions had been made, and which
must have been performed before Spain was bound to perfect the
titles; is a fact rendered prominently notorious by the legislation of
Congress and the litigation in the Courts of this country' for now
nearly twenty years. To this class of cases the eighth article was
intended to apply; and the United States were bound, after the ces-sion of the country, to the same extent that Spain had been bound
before the ratification of the treaty, to perfect them by legislation and
adjudication: and to this end the government has provided that it
may be sued by the claimants in its own Courts; where the claims
shall be adjudged, and the equities of the claimants determined and
settled according to the law of nations, the stipulations of the treaty,
and the proceedings under the same, and the laws and ordinances
of the government from which the claims are alleged to have been
derived.
These are the rules of decision prescribed to the Courts by Congress, in the act of 1824, ch. 173, sec. 2; passed to settle the titles
of Missouri and Arkansas; and made applicable to Florida, by the
act of 1828, ch. 70, sec. 6. By the sixth section of the act of 1824,
the claimant who has a decree in his favour, is entitled to a patent
from the United States; by which means his equitable claim draws
to it the estate in fee. -These are the imperfect claims to which- the
eighth article of the treaty with Spain refers.
That a Spanish concession, carrying on its face a condition, the
performance of which is the consideration for the ultimate perfect
title, is void, unless the condition has been performed in the time prescribed by the ordinances of Spain; was decided by this Court after
the most mature consideration, in the cause of the United States vs.
Kingsley, (12 Peters;) which is the leading decision upon the imperfect titles known as Mill grants ; and which has been. followed
by all others coming within the principles then, with so much care

[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

and accuracy laid down: The concession to Mrs. Wiggins, carrying with it the conditions incident to settlement rights by the ordinances and usages of Spain; a brief notice, in addition to what has
alre ady been said, will be taken of the regulations and ordinances
governing the case. As, on the first point, the practice of the
government in disposing of' the public domain, may be proved by
those familiar with the customs; and, there is in the record, very
satisfactory proof by witnesses of the laws and customs governing
the provincial authorities in this respect ; but as the proof is in
exact accordance with the published ordinances on the subject, of
course the written law will be relied upon.
After the passage of the act of 1828, it was the opinion of the
Attorney General of the United States, that it was indispensable to
the correct decision of the Florida claims by the Court, that a correct translation into the English language should be made of the
Spanish and French ordinances, affecting the land titles in that
country. The task of translating and compiling them was assigned
to Joseph M. White, Esq., then of Florida. The collection was
accordingly made and translated, and the manuscript deposited in
the state department; and Congress was informed of the fact, by a
special message from the President of the United States, of February 11th, 1829. 2 White's Recopilacion, 9, 10. It was after-

wards published by Mr. White; and latterly he has published a
second and enlarged edition, which is the one referred to in this case.
The treaty with Spain for the cession of Florida, was signed 2d
February, 1819: on the 25th of November preceding, the political
and military governor (Coppinger) caused to be published an ordinance setting forth the conditions on which concessions for settle-

inent claims had been issued; obviously with a view to the future
cession. 2 White's Recopilacion, 282-285. From the ordinance
it appears, "That concessions made to foreigners or rnatives, of large
or small portions of lond, carrying their documents with them,
(which shall be certificates issued by the secretary,) without having
cultivated or ever seen the lands granted to them, such concessions
.are of ilo, value or effect; and should be considered as not made, because the abandonment has been voluntary, and that they have
failed in complying. with the conditions prescribed for the encouragement of population :" "and therefore, there is no reason why
they should not revert to the class of public lands, making null the
titles of cession which were made to them."
Ten years had been the time required for cultivation and occupation; this rule was not rigidly adhered to, but the titles were perfected in some instances, where valuable improvements had been
made, and the occupation had been short of ten years; the governors
taking into consideration the distufbed state of the country. These
exceptions were abatements of the general rule, requiring ten years
cultivation and occupation: as Mrs. Wiggins, however, never cultivated, or occupied the land claimed, she took no interest under the

352

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Wiggins.]

rule, or any exception made to it ; and it is free from doubt, had
Spain continued to' govern the country, no title could have been
made to her; nor can any be claimed from the United States, as
success6rs to the rights and obligations of Spain.
It is, therefore, adjudged, that the decree below be reversed, and
the petition dismissed.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Superior Court for the District of East Florida, and was
argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and decreed-by this Court, that the decree of the said Superior Court in this cause be, and.the same is hereby reversed and
annulled; and that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded
to the said Superior Court, with directions to dismiss the petition.
