SUPREME COURT.

THE UNITED STATES VS.

ISAAC MoRRXS.

Indictment under the second and third sections of the act of Congress, entitled, "An Act to
prohibit the carrying on the Slave-trade, from the United States to any foreign Place or
Country;" passed 10th May, 1800.
The schooner Butterfly, carrying the flag of tho United States, and documented as a vessel
of the United States, and having the usual equipments of vessels engaged in the slavetrade, sailed from Havana towards the coast of Africa, on the 27th July, 1839. She was
captured by a British brig of war, and sent into Sierra Leone, on suspicion of being
Spanish property. At the time of the capture, Isaac Morris was in command of the vessel, and was described in the ship's papers, and described himself, as a citizen of the United
States. The vessel was sent, by the British authorities at Sierra Leone, to be dealt with by
the authorities of the United States. Held, that to constitute the offence denounced,in the
isecond section of the act of 10th May, 1800, it was not necessary that there should have been
an actual transportation or carrying of slaves in the vessel of the United States, in which
the party indicted served. 2. The voluntary service of an American citizen on board a
vessel of the United States, in a voyage commenced with intent that the vessel should be
employed in the slave-trade, from one foreign place to another, is an offence against the
second section of the law, although no slaves had been transported in such vessel, or
received on board of her. 3. To constitute the offence under the third section of the
act, it was nqt necessary that there should be an actual transportation of slaves in a
foreign vessel, on board of which the party indicted served. 4. The voluntary service
of an American citizen on board a foreign vessel, in a voyage commenced with intent
that the vessel should be employed and made use of in the transportation of slaves, from
one foreign country to another, is in itself, and where no slaves have been transported in
such vessel, or received on board of her, an oflbece under the third section of the act.
In expounding a penal statute, the Court, certainly, will not extend it beyond the plain
meaning of its words; for it has been long and well settled that such statutes must be
construed strictly. Yet the evident intention of the legislature ought not to be defeated
by a forced and over strict construction.

ON a certificate of division from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Isaac Morris, was indicted under the second and
third sections of the act entitled "An Act in addition to an Act entitled 'An Act to prohibit the carrying on the Slave-trade from the
United States to any foreign Place or Country,' " approved on the
10th of May, 1800.
The first count of the indictment charges that the defendant did,
on the high seas, from the 15th day of June, until the 26th day of
August, in the year 1839, voluntarily serve on board of the schooner
Butterfly, a vessel of the United States ; employed and made use of
in the transportation of slaves from some foreign country or place to
some other foreign country or place: the said defendant being a citizen of the United States.
The second count charges, that the defendant did, 6n the high
seas, from the 15th day of June to the 26th day of August, voluntarily serve on board of the schooner Butterfly, being a foreign vessel employed in the slave-trade: the defendant being a citizen of the
United States.

[The United States vs. Morris.]

It was proved, on the trial, on the part of the prosecution, that the
schooner Butterfly, carrying the flag of the United States, and documented as a vessel of the United States, (her register being dated the
24th day of May, 1839, and issued by the collector of New Orleans
to Nathan Farnsworth, a citizen of the United States, as owner,) was
boarded and examined, on the 26th day of August, 1839, on the high
seas, in latitude 50 25' north, longitude 300 east, near Cape St. Paul's,
on the coast of Africa, by the British brig of war Dolphin, on suspicion of being a Spanish vessel engaged in the slave-trade, in contravention of the treaty between Great Britain and Spain for the suppression of the slave-trade. That on such examination,'the vessel
was found to be on her voyage from Havana, in the island of Cuba,
which port she bad left on the 27th day of July, 1839,, bound to St.
Thomas, in the island of Principe, near the coast of Africa; that the
vessel had on board twenty-four large leagers capable of containing
each from two hundred and fifty to three hundred gallons of water;
eighteen of these were in shocks, that is, the staves were in bundle
not fitted; four of them contained water, ahd two contained bread;
there was a quantity of plank stowed away in the hold, similar to
the planks used in framing slave-decks, but this plank could not
have been fitted as a slave-deck until the vessel had discharged her
cargo; and that such leagers and slave-decks were commonly found
to be a part of the equipments and fittings of vessels engaged in the
slave-trade on the coast of Africa; that she had on board a full
cargo, consisting of various commodities, adapted either to the traffic
in negroes, or to an r laowful trade carried on by trading vessels upon
the coast of Africa; that the prisoner was in command of the vessel;
that he was described in the ship's papers, and represented himself
as a citizen of the United States; that the rest of the ship's company
were represented in the crew-list as Spaniards, or Portuguese, who
had been shipped at Havana; that there were also on board fourteen
Spaniards who had been received at Havana as passengers; that
the cargo bad been shipped at the same place, and according to the
invoice and bill of lading was to have been delivered at St. Thomas,
in the island of Principe, aforesaid, and appeared, by the documents,
to be owned by persons yesiding at Havana; that two log-books,
one in English and the other in Spanish, were found on board; that
various documentsin the Spanish language were also found on
board; that under these circumstances, the vessel was captured by
the Dolphin, suspecting the same to be Spanish property, and sent
fbr adjudication to Sierra Leone t6 be proceeded against in ihe
Mixed Commission Court at that place, which Court declined taking
Jognisance of the case on account of the vessel being documented as
an American vessel; that she was then sent to the port of New York,
to be dealt with by the authorities of the United States as they might
think proper.
No slaves were found on board the vessel at the time of her capture; and it was testified by the witnesses for the prosecution, that
from the cargo and situation in which the vessel was found, no
59

466

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Morris.]

slaves could have bden carried or transported in her at any time
during the voyage on which she was then engaged: that it would
have been necessary to have discharged the cargo before slaves
could have been taken on board: that the vessel was short of water,
having only about eleven gallons on board when she-was captured:
and that Cape St. Paul's is a common watering place on that coast,
being about five hundred miles distant from the island of Principe.
Upon the foregoing state of facts, the judges were divided in opinion upon the four following questions; which were presented on
the facts aforesaid for their decision:
1st. Whether it is necessary, in order to constitute the offence denounced in the second section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800,
above referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or
carrying of slaves in the vessel of the United States on board of
which the 'party indicted is alleged to have served.
2d. Whether it is necessary, in order to constitute the offence
denounced in the third section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800,
above referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or
carrying of slaves in a foreign vessel, on board of which the party
indicted is alleged to have served.
3d. Whether the voluntary service of an American citizen on
board a vessel of the United States, on a voyage commenced with
the intent that the vessel should be employed and made use of in
the transporting or carrying of slaves from- one foreign country or
place to. another, is in itself, and where no slaves had been transported in such vessel, or received on board her, an offence under the
said second section.
4th. Whether the voluntary service of an American citizen, on
board a foreign vessel, on a voyage commenced with the intent that
.he vessel should be employed and made use of in the transportation
and carrying of slaves, from one foreign country or place to another,
is in itself, and where no slaves had been transported in such vessel,
or received on board her, an offence under the said third section.
Which points were stated under the direction of the Court, at
the request of the counsel for the parties in the cause, and ordered
to be certified into the Supreme Court of the United States, pursuant
to the act in such cases made and provided.
The case was a,'gued by Mr. Gilpin, Attorney. General of the
United States, for the plaintiffs; and by Mr. Nelson, for the defendant. Mr. Philip Hamilton submitted a written argument for
the defendant.
Mr. Gilpin, fbr the United States.
The questions that present themselves in this case are these;
1. Whether the voluntary service on boaid of an American vessel, on a voyage commenced with the intent that she shall be employed itL the transportation and carrying of slaves, is a violation of
the second section of the act of 10th May, 1800, (1 Story's Laws,
780,) without any slaves being actually transported or carried.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

fThe United States vs. Morris.]

2. Whether the voluntary service on board of a foreign vessel,
on a voyage commenced with the intent that she shall be employed
in the slave-trade, is a violation of the third section of the same act,
without any slaves being actually transported or carried.
In the construction of a statute, the first inquiry is, what was the
intention of the legislature ? The second, whether that intention is
so clearly expressed as to embrace within its prohibition the acts
complained of.
I. The whole scope of the enactments of Congress shows their
intention to punish every American citizen who engages in the
slave-trade. As early as 1794, they passed an act "to prohibit carrying on the slave-trade." 1 Story's Laws, 319. This was followed,
in 1800, by an additional act for the same purpose. 1 Story's Laws,
780. In 1807, and in 1818, acts were passed, "to prohibit the importation of slaves into the United States." 2 Story's Laws, 1050.
3 Story's Laws, 1698. In 1819, additional prohibitions against
"the slave-trade" were adopted. 3 Story's Laws, 1752. And,
finally, in 1830, it was declared to be piracy. 3 Story's Laws, 1798.
This series of acts evinces the evident iitention of Gongress to prevent the slave-trade, the traffic; whether to the United States, or to
foreign countries.
When we examine the particular provisions of these various
laws, the same intention is yet more apparent. The fitting out of
vessels for the trade, their sailing outward, their employment in the
actual traffic, their bringing slaves to the United States, or taking them
to foreign ports, are all matters of minute regulation. No citizen
can fit out or equip a vessel for the slave-trade, either-in any part
of the United States, 6r in any other place, to gail -from the UnitedStat ,s; nor can be hold any property, directly or indirectly, in a
vessel engaged in transporting slaves between two foreign-countries; nor can a vessel sail from the United States to engage in such
traffic ; and if she clears out for the coast of Africa, security against
her engaging in such traffic may be required,'and must be given.
1 Story's Laws, 319. 780.

3 Story's Laws, 1698.

These are pro-

visions to guard against, prevent, and punish the preparatory or
previous steps connected with this traffic. Again, the President is
to cause an armed vessel to cruise on the African coast, and to bring
into our ports all American vessels intended to transport slaves;
severe penalties are provided against any citizens who shall there
take slaves on board, or transport them to a foreign country, or to
the United States; or be found with any so brought for the purposes
of sale, in any of our ports or bays; or hold, sell, or dispose ot them.
1 Story's Laws, 319.

2 Story's Laws, 886. 1050.

3 Story's Laws,

1698. 1752. Here, then, is a series of enactments, providing against
every contingency in which American citizens can be connected
with this traffic, except their service in American or foreign vessels,
during the outward voyage. Is it possible that Congress could omit
to provide for this also? Yet such is the fact, unless they have
done so by the second and third sections ofthe act of 10th May,

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Morris.)

1800. 1 Story's La*s, 780. It is a well established rule, that the
causelproducing a law, and the general object to be attained, are to
be considered in construing it. Preston vs. Browder, 1 Wheat. 124.
If this rule be applied, the inference is irresistible that the legislature intended by these sections to include that portion of the traffic
which is not elsewhere provided for; that they intended the voluntary participation of our citizens in it should be punished, independently or equally with other conduct connected with such participation.
I. Is this intention so expressed in the act, as to subject an
offender to its penalties ? Is he adequately warned by its language
of the nature of the offence ? No doubt is expressed as to the clearness with which the intention of Congress is made known on all
points but one. The persorl, the service, the vessel, are clearly
designated. But "the voyage," which it was intended to prohibit,
is supposed to be doubtful. It is alleged, that, employment in the
transportation and carrying of slaves," cannot refer to the outward
voyage ; but relates exclusively to one during which the vessel has
slaves actually on board. Is this the import of the words?" Are
they not a general designation of the prohibited traffic ? Do they
not signify the business in which the vessel'is employed ? Coaches
are engaged "in the transportation of passengers :" surely, the occasional want of a passenger does not change the character or description of their employment. Carriers are engaged in the transportation
of merchandise, though their vehicles may be sometimes empty,
Vessels are engaged in the fisheries, though a voyage of thousands
of miles is necessary before they reach the place where they are
actually employed in fishing. Carriers of the mail are properly so
designated, though no mail be at a particular moment in their
charge. Persons are employed in the post-office, though not performing at every instant the duties annexed to their office. Tonnage duties are payable by vessels "employed in he transportation
of goods coastwise," at every entry, though they may be occasionally without a cargo. This construction is sanctioned by'numerous
acts of Congress, relating to navigation, the fisheries, and the postoffice establishment., 1 Story's Laws, 5. 208. 2 Story's Laws, 1353.
3 Story's Laws, 1986. 4 Story's Laws, 2256.
But this signification is made more obvious by an examination
of the particular statutes on this subject. The act of 1794 is enti
tled, "to prohibit carrying on the slave-trade," (1 Story's Laws,
319;) yet it provides against the " fitting out" of vessels in our
ports. How is this "carrying on the slave-trade," unless all parts of
the general design are included in that phrase ? So the act of 3d
March, 1819, (3 Story's Laws, 1752,) was passed "to prohibit the
slave-trade ;" yet it subjects vessels." intended for the purpose of
carrying slaves," to forfeiture. So the act of 10th May, 1800; (1
Story's Laws, 780,) upon the construction of which the present case
turns, and which provides both for the punishment of persons, and
the forfeiture of vessels; condemns a vessel for being engaged in the

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

469

[The United States vs. Morris.]

business of the slave-trade. Can it be contended that the outward
Voyage of a vessel fitted out for the slave-trade, is not included in
that language; and, if so, is it possible to exclude. from the punishment prescribed by the act, a person voluntarily and knowingly
serving on board the vessel, when its object was evidently to reach
the one as well as the other? Again, the third section punishes a
citizen of the United States who voluntarily serves on board of a
foreign vessel engaged in the slave-trade; the second section
punishes a citizen of the United States who voluntarily .serves on
board of an American vessel engaged in transportation ana carrying of slaves. Could Congress intend to make the same act of a
citizen of the United States more or less criminal in the one case
than in the other ? Yet so it must do, if a different meaning is to
be given to the language used in the two sections.
The construction contended for is also sanctioned by judicial decisions. The case of the Alexander, 3 Mason, 175, was an indictment
for holding a right of property in a vessel "employed in the transportation and carrying of slaves." The vessel was prepared for that
purpose, but had taken no slaves on board.; yet the defendant was
convicted. In the case of the Fortuna, 1 Dodson, 81, the outward
voyage was held to be a violation of the slave-trade acts. In
the case of the Donna Marianna, 1 Dodson, 91, Sir William Scott
condemneda vessel on the outward voyage, and not having taken
any slaves on board,' under the act of 23d May, 1806, (23 Raithby's Stat. at Large, 326,) although the words of that act only embrace a vessel in which'slaves "shall be exported, transported, carried," &c. These are direct judicial decisions on the point n question. The 'same principle of interpretation may be recognised in
other cases. The Emily and Caroline, 9 Wheat. 381, was a libel
under the act of 22d March, 1794, which condemns a vessel if she
shall be fitted out for the slave-trade. Her fitting out was but just
begun, yet it was held sufficient. In the Merino, 9 Wheat. 391, two
points are established: that the act of 1oth May, 1800, was meant
to prevent any citizen of the United States from participating in or
affording facilities for the slave-trade,; and that this general intent
was to be regarded in its construction. The Plattsburgh, 10 Wheat.
133, was condemned for being fitted out, under the act of 22d March,
1794, though the equipment was only commenced. In the United
States vs. Gooding, 12 Wheat. 460, the vessel sailed from Baltimore
without any fitments, they being sent in another vessel to St. Thomas, where she was to put them on board; yet this was held to be
a fitting out at Baltimore. In the United States vs. Quincy, 6 Peters,
464, an indictment for fitting out a vessel, with intent to employ her
in committing hostilities, was sustained, although: the fitments were
admitted to be insufficient.
The result is, that where the general intent of a statute isto prevent certain acts, the subordinate proceedings, necessarily connected
with them and coming within that intent, are embraced in its provisions. It is true, that in penal laws a more rigid rule of construcVOL. XIV.-2 R

470

SUPREME COURT.

[The United States vs. Morris.]
tion prevails than in relation to other statutes; but that rule does
not authorize or contemplate a merely literal interpretation, at the
expense of an evident intent, so expressed as to be well known to
a person violating it. 5 Wheat. 76. 95. 2 Mason, 144. Paine, 209.
The act forbidden to be done was, voluntarily serving in this voyage, which was a voyage for the purpose of transporting slaves;
whether or not that purpose was fully effected is immaterial, if it
has been proved to the satisfaction of the jury that such was in fact
the purpose of the voyage then in progress; and that the participation of the defendant in it was voluntary on his part, with a knowledge of that purpose.
Mr. Philip Hamilton, for the defendant, submitted the following
written argument :
Though four points are presented on the record, the re are substantially but two, viz. the first and fourth. These decided, dispose
of the others.
1. To sustain the prosecution, the case of the Alexander, 3 Mason, is chiefly relied on. The analogy, though ingenious, does not
seem just; as between a fostered trade and a pursuit denounced by
a penal statute, to interpret that statute.
The language used by Congress in reference to the fisheries should
not be adopted in reference to the slave-trade; as the act in relation
to the former speaks of "carrying on fisheries ;" "employed in the
fisheries;" "a fishing voyage;" without defining any acts that shall
constitute the pursuit or employment: it is otherwise in regard to
the slave-trade.
See acts of Congress of 18th February, 1793,
(1 Story's Laws U. S. 285;) act of June 19th, 1813, sec. 1, 2,
(2 Story's Laws, 1315.)
2. It is improbable that the act of 1800, section third, aimed to
reach intent; as the intent could not have been manifested in any
other manner than by the precise acts inhibited by the second section, viz. the carrying, &c.
The honest and the guilty trade would have been precisely similar to a certain point. Both vessels would go to the coast. Both
would be similarly equipped. . Both would there take slaves on
board.
The next movement indicates the intent, and is the very carrying
trade denounced by the second section. It would be a strange
anomaly to legislate in regard to intent, after having legislated -in
regard to the particular fact, when the intent could only be estab.
lished by the consummation of the act forbidden.
Contemporaneous circumstances and interests repel the idea that
intent was aimed at,.as the friends of the trade would never jeopard
it by exposing the lawful trader to be captured on her outward voyage, in order to discover, from the vessel, evidence that she intended
to prosecute an unlawful trade.
3. If Congress aimed at intent, it.would have been so expressed
in the act. No acts were ever more deliberated on, or more artifi-

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

471

[The United States vs. Morris.]

cially prepared than the early slave acts. -The friends of the trade
watched the legislation with too much jealousy, not to detect that
lurking object if it had existed. Refer to all the acts, and it will be
found that wherever intent has been aimed at, it has been distinctly
expressed. 1st, 2d, and 3d sec. of the act of March, 1794, (1 Story's
Laws U. S. 319 ;) 2d and 3d sec. of the act, of 20th April, 1818,
(3Story'sLaws U. S. 1698.)
4. If the prosecutor can claim that intent was involved in the
third section of the act of 1800, why may he not say it was, also the
subject of the fourth section of the act of May 15th, 1820 ? both acts
using synonymous expressions-the act of 1800, "employed in the
slave-trade ;"1 act of 1820, "4carrying on the slave-trade."
So the third section of the same act subjects the offenders to capital punishment, who, "engaged in a piratical cruise or enterprise,"
shall land and commit robbery. The expressions are as general as
"carrying on fisheries ;" "a fishing voyage:" yet, could a man be
guilty of the capital offence who was on board of a vessel designed
for "carrying on the slave-trade," who did not decoy or land and
forcibly seize slaves; or who was "engaged in a piratical cruise or
enterprise," and did not land and commit robbery?
In this prosecution, the United States seek, by blending the second
and third sections of the act of 1800, to sustainthe construction that
intent was aimed at. With the same propriety they might contend,
that the moment this vessel sailed from her home poir she was guilty
of piracy, under the act of 1820, because she might have been designed for the purposes therein specified.
This expanding and enlarging of statutes by construction; this
adaptation of statutes to the varying facts and circumstances of each
case, rather than applying-the varying facts to the immutable statute,
is wholly inadmissible; especially so in criminal jurisprudence.
5. In the case of the Alexander, the learned judge interprets the
first and second sections by the third and fourth, and thinks Con.
gress intended the same thing. Admitting that to a certain extent
they mean the same, we still contend that the third and fourth sections are to be interpreted by the first and second. The meaning
of the second section we get from the act itself, viz. the actual carrying of slaves. Section first (1800) gives double the value of slaves
which may have been transported or carried. Section, fourth forfeits
allbut the slaves which may have been found on board: also, precludes the right to claim slaves found on board. The*language
of the second section so clearly and explicitly expresses the offence
intended to be denouiced, that every man who reads must understand what is forbidden: hence there is no room for construction ; and the language must be taken in its natural sense and ordinary signification and import. 1 Kent's Cott. 462. The words
of a statute are 'to be taken in their natural sense. and ordinary signification and import.
In the United States vs.Wilberger, 5 Wheat. 96, it is held: Where

472

SUPREME COURT.
[The United States vs. Morris.]

there is no ambiguity in the words, there is no room for eonstructionh The case must be a strong one indeed to justify a Court in
departing from the plain meaning of words, especially in a penal
act, in search of an intention which the Words themselves did not
suggest.
That the second section is limited to the actual transportation as
we claim for it, will appear from a brief historical view of the
slave acts.
The Constitution, article one, section nine, declares, that the
migration or importation of such persons, as any of the states now
existing (1789) shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited
by Congress prior to the year 1808. That article secures the import
trade for a given period. In 1794, the current of public sentiment
became irresistible, and by the act of that date the traffic was cut up
so far as measures suggested themselves to the wisdom of Congress,
and were consistent with the sacred obligation of that instrument.
The cardinal objects of the trade which could be reached, were
the export and carrying trade. The subjects in regard to which
Congress could legislate, were vessels and persons. They might
legislate over the property of citizens and foreigners residing within
the United States, as well as over their persons.
By sec. 1 of the act of 1794, vessels of citizens or foreigners
fitted out from the United States to be employed in the export or
carrying trade, were forfeited. By the second section of that act,
they reached the persons of citizens or foreigners in the United
States, by a severe penalty, who should fit out the vessels. Thus
the subject rested until the year 1800, when it was ascertained that
the act of 1794, did not effectually accomplish its object; as ingenuity, sharpened by the hope of gain, soon devised means to evade
that law. The carrying trade was found so lucrative, that though
vessels might not be fitted out from the UnitQd States, still American capital might be embarked in foreign vessels. By sec. 1 of the
act of 1800, all right and property directly or indirectly owned in
any vessel (American or foreign) employed in the carrying trade,
was forfeited. Thus American capital and American vessels being
excluded, Congress determining still further to cut up the trade, prohibited American citizens from rendering their personal services to
promote it, and did so by the second and third sections of the act of
1800. The act of 1800 was merely auxiliary to the act of 1794; and
from a careful examination of both, it will appear, that Congress
therein exhausted aU their powers of legislation on the subject, embarrassed as it was by the Constitution.
6. It thus appearing that to prevent American citizens from serving on board of Americanmvessels employed in the carrying trade,
was an essential link in the system, it is obvious, that the second
section is to be expounded precisely as the concise and perspicuous
language expresses, and that there is no room for construction. Jn
the third section a different form of expression is adopted. It would

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

473

[The'United States vs. Morris.)

perhaps, be assuming too much to say, that the change was not a
change of substance, rather than a loose and inartificial employment of language.
We contend, that the third section means the same thing as the
second, and something more. It means the slave-trade in foreign
vessels, in all its illegal branches, so declared by Congress. The
second section is confined to one portion of it. It could not refer
to the slave-trade prohibited by the laws of any other country,
for two obvious reasons: 1. Because American citizens are not to
be punished by the laws of the United States, for a violation of
the municipal laws of any other power. 2. If otherwise, in point
of fact, the slave trade was a lawful trade in all its branches
throughout the world, until long after this period. In 1807, the first
act of the Parliamentof England was passed on this subject.
If this proposition be correct, then the slave-trade punished by
the third section, was the trade prohibited by Congress, viz.: the
carrying trade and the export trade on board of foreign vessels; to
embrace these two branches, the general expression, "slave-trade,"
was peculiarly appropriate. Whatever might have been the object
of Congress, it is evident, by collating the acts and the sections of
each, that the construction claimed for it by the prosecution cannot
be sustained.
7. In addition to these considerations, the defect of ',isdom should
not be attributed to Congress of passing a law that mnist inevitably
tesult in the consummation of a wicked purpose. Once embarked
in the pursuit, it is more dangerous to recede than to advance;
when to go forward presents the alluring prospects of gain, with
the same, and, perhaps, greater chances of impunity.
Mr. Nelson, for the defendant, stated that he would only ask the
attention of the Court to the acts of Congress.
The act of 1794, was intended to embrace two descriptions of
cases. First, transporting of slaves from a foreign country to the
-United States. Second, transporting slaves to foreign countries.
Jt also applies to fitting out vessels to carry on the slave-trade.
This was the condition of the law when the act of 1800 was
passed ; and the object of that act was to make the penalties of the
former act applicable to vessels not built in the United States.
The purpose of this prosecution is not to forfeit the vessel, but to
punish persons serving on board of a vessel engaged in the slavetrade. The employment of a person on board a vessel engaged in the
transportation and carrying of slaves, is a very different thing from
the employment of a vessel, or person on board of a vessel, designed
to be employed in the slave-trade. Whenever the legislature design
to punish intention, they so express it.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes before us upon a certificate of division from the
Circuit Court of the United States, for the Southern District of New
York, in the second circuit.

The defendant, Isaac Morris, is indicted under the second and
third sections of the act entitled "An Act in addition to an Act entitled ' An Act to prohibit the carrying on the Stave-trade from the
United States to any fireign'Place or Country," approved on the
10th of May, 1800.
The first count of the indictment charges that the defendant did,
on the high seas, from the 15th of June until the 26th of August,
in the year 1839, voluntarily serve on board of the schooner But.
terfly, a vessel of the United States, employed and made use of in
the transportation of slaves from some foreign country or place, to
some other foreign country or place, the said defendant being a citizen of the United- States.
The second count charges that the defendant did, on the high
seas, from the 15th day of June to the 26th day of August, volun-

tarily serve on board of the schooner Butterfly, being a foreign
vessel employed in the slave-trade; the defendant being a citizen
of the United States.
It was proved on the trial, on the part of the prosecution,
that
the schooner Butterfly, carrying the flag of the United States, and
documented as a vessel of the United States, sailed from Havana,
for the coast of Africa, on the 27th of July, 1839, having on board
the usual and peculiar equipments of vessels engaged in the transportation of slaves from the coast of Africa to other places. Before she reached the African coast, and before any siaves were
taken on board, she was captured by the Dolphin, a British brig of
war, and carried into Sierra Leone; upon suspicion of being Spanish
property, to be proceeded against in the Mixed Commission Court
at that place. At the time of her capture, I s aac Morris was in
command of the vessel, and was described in the ship's papers and
represented himself as a citizen of the United States. The Court
at Sierra Leone declined taking cognisance of the case, because
the vessel was documented as an American vessel; and she was
then sent to New 'York, to be dealt with by the authorities of the
United States, as they might think proper.
Upon the foregoing state of facts, the judges were divided in opinion upon the four following questions, which were presented on
the facts aforesaid for their decision:
1. Whether it is necessary in order to constitute the offence denounced in the second section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800,
above referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or
carrying of slaves in the vessel of the United States, on board of
which the party indicted is alleged to have served.
2. Whether it is necessary in order to constitute the offence denounced in the third section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800,
above referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or
carrying of slaves in a foreign vessel, on board of which the party
indicted is alleged to have served.
3. Whether the voluntary service of an American citizen, on

board a vessel of the United States, in a voyage commenced with
the intent that the vessel should be employed and made use of in
the transporting or carrying of slaves from one foreign country or
place to another, is in itself, and where no slaves had been transported in such vessel, or received on board her, an offence under the
said second section.
4. Whether the voluntary service of an American citizen, on
board a foreign vessel, in a voyage commenced with the intent that
the vessel should be employed and made use of in the transportation
and carrying of slaves from one foreign country or place to another,
is in itself, and where no slaves have been transported in such
vessel, or received on board her, an offence under the said third
section.
And these points having been certified to this Court, we proceed
to express our opinion upon them.
1 The second section of the act of Congress above mentioned, declares, "that it shall be unlawful for any. citizen of the United
States, or other person residing therein, to serve on board any vessel
of the United States, employed or made use of in the transportation
or carrying of slaves from one foreign country or place to another;
an, -any such citizen or other person voluntarily serving as aforesaidshall be liable to be indicted therefor, and on conviction thereof
shall be liable to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars, and be
imprisoned not exceeding two years."
The first and third points certified from the Circuit Court, depend
on the construction of this section.
* In expounding a penal statute the Court certainly will not extend
it beyond the plain meaning of its words; for it has been long and
well settled, that such statutes must be construed strictly. Yet the

evident intention of the legislature ought not to be defeated by a
forced and overstrict construction.

5 Wheat. 95.

The question ii this case is, whether a vessel on her outward
voyage to the coast of Africa, for the purpose of taking on board a
cargo of slaves, is "employed or made use of" in the transportation
or carrying of slaves from one foreign country or place .to another,
before
any slaves are received on board?
To be
"employed" in any thing, means not only the act of
doing
it, but also to be engaged to do it; to be under contract or orders to
do it. And this is not only the ordinary meaning of the word, but
it has, frequently been used in that sense in other acts of Congress.
Thus, for example, the sedond section of the act of March 3d, 1825,
entited, "an act to reduce into one, the several acts establishing and
regulating the post-office department,"' declares, " that the Postmaster-general, and all other persons 'employed' in the general postoffice, or in the care, custody, or conveyance of the mail, shall, previous to entering upon the duties assigned to them," take the oath
prescribed by that section. Here the persons who have contracted
to perform certain duties in the general post-office, are described as

476

SUPREME COURT.

[The United States vs. Moris.]
"employed" in that department, before they enter upon the duties
assigned them. So, also, in the twenty-first section of the same
law, various offences, such as the embezzling or destroying any
letter, are enumerated, and the punishment prescribed, when com.
mitted by any person "employed in any of the departments of the
post-office establishment." Yet it cannot be supposed that the party
must be actually engaged in transacting his official duties when the
letter was embezzled or destroyed, in order to constitute the offence
described in this section.
Again, tife act of July 2d, 1813, sec. 8, (2 Story, 1353,) declares,
that ceitain yessels ' employed" in the fisheries, shall not be entitled
to the bounties therein granted, unless the master makes an agreement, in writing or in print, with every fisherman employed therein
before he proceeds on any fishing voyage. Here the vessel is spoken
of as "employed" in the fisheries, before she sails on the voyage.
So, also, the act of March 3d, 1831, (4 Story, 2256,) entitled, "an
act concerning vessels employed in the whale fishery," authorizes
vessels owned by any incorporated company, and " employed
wholly in the whale fishery," to be registered or enrolled, and
licensed in a particular manner, "so long as any such vessel shall
be wholly employed in the whale fishery."
The register or enrolment and license, must be obtained before the vessel sails on her
outward voyage to the Whaling grounds; and, consequently, in that
voyage she must be " employed" in the whale fishery, in the
sense in which these words re used in the act of Congress; otherwise, she would not be entitled to the register or enrolment'and
license authorized by this law.
In like manner, the vessel in question was employed in the transportation of slaves, within the meaning of the act of Congress of
May 10th, 1800, if she was sailing on her outward voyage to the
African coast, in order to take them on board, to be transported to
another foreign country. In such a voyage, the vesseI is employed
in the business of transporting and carrying slaves from one foreign
country to another. In other words, she is employed in the slavetrade. And any citizen of'the United States, who shall voluntarily
serve on board any vessel of the United States, on such a voyage,
is guilty of the offence mentioned in the 'second section of this act
of Congress. It is hardly necessary to add, that "voluntarily," in
this section, means, "with knowledge" of the business in which she
is employed. And in order to constitute the offence, the party must
have knowledge that the vessel was bound to the coast of Africa,
for the purpose of taking slaves on board, to be transported to some
other foreign country.
The same reasoning aoplies to the third section of the law, under
which the second and fourth points certified to this Court have
arisen. The vessel is "employed 'inthe slave-trade" when sailing
to the African coast for the purpose of tafking the slaves on board.
We therefore answer the first and second questions in'the nega-

tive, and the third and fourth in the affirmative; and it will be certified accordingly to the Circuit Court.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District
of New York, and on the points and questions on which the judges
of the said Circuit Court were opposed in opinion, and which were
certified to this Court for, its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel.
On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court :
1. That it is not necessary, in order to constitute the offence denounced in the second section of the act of the 1Oth of May, 1800,
referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or carrying
of slaves in the vessel of the United States, on board of which the
party indicted is alleged to have served.
2. That it is not necessary, in order to constitute the offence denounced in the third section of the act of the 10th of May, 1800,
above referred to, that there should be an actual transportation or
carrying of slaves in a foreign vessel, on board of which the party
indicted is alleged to have served.
3. That the voluntary service of an American citizen on board a
vessel of the United States, in a voyage commenced with the intent
that the vessel should be employed and made use of in the transporting or carrying of slaves from one foreign country or place to
another, is in itself, and where no slaves had been transported in
such vessel, or received on board her, an offence under the said
second section.
4. That the voluntary service of an American citizen on board
a foreign vessel, in a voyage commenced with the intent that the
vessel should be employed and made use of in the transportation and
carrying of slaves from one foreign country or place to another, is in
itself, and where no slaves had beefi transported in such vessel, or
received on board her, an offence under the said third section.
Whereupon, it is now here ordered and adjudged that it be so
certified to the said Circuit Court accordingly.
