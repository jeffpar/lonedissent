By a rule of the Supreme Court, the practice of the English Cocrts of Chancery is the
practice in tho Courts of Equity of the United States. In England the party who puts
in a plea, which is the subject of discussion, has the right to begin and conclude the
.argument. The same rule should prevail in the Courts of the United States, in Chancery cases.
In a case in which two sovereign states of the United States are litigating a question of
boundary between 'them, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court have
decided, that the rules and practice of the Court of Chancery should, substantially, govern
in conducting the suit to a final issue. 12 Peters, 735-739. The Court, on re-examining the subject, are fully satisfied with the decision.
In a controversy where two sovereign states are contesting the boundary between them, it
is the duty of the Court to mould the rules of Chancery practice and pleading in such a
manner as to bring the case to a final hearing on its merits. It is too important in its
character, and the interests concerned too great, to be decided upon the mere technical
principles of Chanceiy pleading.
In ordinary cases between individuals,,the Court' of Chancery has always exercised an
equitable discretion in relation to its rules of pleading, whenever it has been found necesbary to do so for the purposes of justice. In a case in which two sovereign states are
contesting a question of boundary, the most liberal principles of practice and pleading
ought, unquestionably, to be adopted, in order to enable both parties to present their
respective claims in their full strength. If a plea put in by the defendant may in any
degree embarrass the complainant in bringing out-the proofs of his claim on which he
relies, the case ought not to be disposed of on such an issue. Undoubtedly, the defendant must have the full benefit of the defence which the plea discloses, but, at the
same time, the proceedings ought to be so ordered as to give the complainant a full hearing on the whole of his case.
According to the rules of pleading in the Chancbry Courts, if the plea is unexceptionable
in its form and character, the complainant must either set it down for argument, or,he
must reply to it,,and put in issue the facts relied on in the plea. If he elects to proceed
in the manner first mentioned, and sets down the plea for argument, he then admits the
truth of all the facts stated in the plea, and merely denies their sufficiency in point of
law to prevent the recovery. If, on the other hand, he replies to the plea, and denies
the truth of the facts therein stated, he admits that if the particular facts stated in the
plea are true, they are then sufficient in law to'bar his recovery ; and if they are proved
to be true, the bill must be dismissed, without a reference to the equity arising from any
other facts stated in the bill.
If a jlea upon argument is ruled to be sufficient in law to bar the recovery of the complainant, the Court of Chancery would, according to its uniform practice, allow him to
amend, and put in issue, by a proper replication, the truth of the facts stated in the plea.
But in either case the controversy would turn altogether upon the facts stated in the
plea,'if the plea is permitted to stand. It is the strict and technical charecter of those
rules of pleading, and the danger of injustice often arising from them, which has given
rise to the equitable discretion always exercised by the Courts of Chancery in relation
to pleas. In many cases, when they are not overruled, the Court will not permit them
to have the full effect of a plea; and will, in some cares, leave to the defendant the
benefit of it at the hearing: and, in others, will order it to stand for an answer, as, in the
judgment of the Court, may best subserve the pmr'poses of justice.
The state of Rhode Island, in a bill against the state of Massachusetts, forthe settlement
of the boundary between the states, had set forth certain facts on which she relied in
support of her claim for the decision of the Supreme Court, that the boundary claimed
by the state of Massachusetts was not the true line of division between the states, acMr. Justice STOUT did not sit in this case.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]
cording to their respective charters. To this bill, the state of Massachusetts put in a
plea and answer; which the counsel for the state of Rhode Island deemed to be insufficient. On a question, whether the plea and answer were insufficient, the Court held;
that as, if the Court proceeded to decide the case upon the plea, it must assume without
any proof on either side, that the facts stated in the plea are correctly stated, and incorrectly set forth in the bill, then it would be deciding the case upon such an issue as would
strike out the very gist of the complainant's case; and exclude the facts upon whiph the
whole equity is founded, if the complainant has any. The Court held, that it would
be unjust to the*complainant not to give an opportunity of being heard according to the
reat state of the case, between the parties ; and to shut out from consideration the many
facts on which he relies to maintain his suit.
It is a general rule, that a plea ought not to contain more dcfences than one. Various
facts can never be pleaded in one pIe, ; unless they are all conducive to the single point
on which the defendant means to rest his defence.
The plea of the state of Massachusetts, after setting forth various proceedings which preceded and followed the execution of certain agreements with Rhode Island, conducing
to show the obligatory and conclusive effect of those agreements uporf both states, as an
accord and compromise of a disputed right; proceeded to aver that Massachusetts had
occupied and exercised jurisdiction and sovereignty, according to the agreement, to this
present time: and then sets up as a defence, that the state of Massachusetts had occupied and exercised jurisdiction over the territory from that time up to the prdsent. The
defendants then plead the agreements of 1710 and 1718, and unmolested possession
from that time, in bar to the whole bill of the complainant. The Court held, that this
plea is twofold: 1. An.accord and compromise of a disputed right. 2. Prescription, or
an unmolested possession from the time of the agreement. These two defences are entirely distinct and separate; and depend upon different principles. Here are two defences
in the same plea, contrary to the established rules of pleading. The accord and compromise, and the title by prescription united in this plea, render it multifarious: and
it ought to be overruled on this account.

THIS case was before the Court at January term, 1838. The
state of Rhode Island, in 1832, had tiled a bill against the state of
Massachusetts, for the settlement of the boundary between the two
states; to which bill Mr. Webster, at January term, 1834, appeared
for the defendant; and on his motion, the cause was continued until
the following term, when a plea and answer were filed by him, as
the counsel for Massachusetts. Before January term, 1837, the
state of Rhode Island filed a replication to the plea and answer of
the defendant; at the same time giving notice of d motion to withdraw the same.
At January term, 1838, the counsel for Massachusetts moved to
dismiss the bill filed by the state of Rhode Island,-on the ground
that the Court had no jurisdiction of the cause.
This motion was argued Ly Mr. Austin, the attorney general
of Massachusetts, and by Mr. Webster, for Massachusetts; and by
Mr. Hazard and Mr. Southard, for the state of Rhode Island: and
was overruled.' 12 Peters, 657.
Afterwards, at the same term, Mr. Webster, on behalf of the
state of Massachusetts, asher attorney and counsel in Court, moved
for leave to withdraw the plea filed in the case on the part of Mas-

sachusetts; and also the appearance which had been entered for the
state. Mr. Hazard moved for leave to withdraw the general replication to the plea of the, defendant in bar, and to amend the original bill.

212

SUPREME COURT.
rThe State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

The Court, after argument, ordered, that if -the counsel on behalf
of Massachusetts shall elect to withdraw the appearance before
entered, that leave be given for the same; and the state of Rhode
Island may proceed ex parte. But, if the appearance be not withdrawn, that then, as no testimony has' been taken, the parties be
alowed to withdraw or amend the pleadings under such order as
the Court may hereafter make. 12 Peters, 756.
At January term, 1839, Mr. Southard, on behalf of the state of
Rhode Island, stated, that the bill filed by the state had been
amended; and moved that a rule be granted on the state of Massachusetts, to answer in a short time, so that the cause might be disposed of during the term.
The Court, the bill of the state of Rhode Island having been
amended the second day of theterm, ordered that the state of Massachusetts should be allowed until the first Monday in August 1839,
to elect whether the state will withdraw, its. appearance, pursuant to
the leave granted at January term, 1838; and if withdrawn within
that time; the state of Rhode Island should be, thereupon, at liberty
to proceed ex parte. If the appearance of the state of Massachusetts should not be withdrawn before the first Monday in August
1839, the state to answer the amended bill before the second day
of January, 1840. 13 Peters, 23.
The amendments made by the complainants in the bill were,chiefly,
the insertion, by reference to reports of the commissioners of the
colony of Massachusetts to the government of Massachusetts, while
a colony, on the 13th of April, 1750, and on the 21st of February,
1792, to the legislature of the state of Massachusetts, appointed by
an act of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, passed on the 8th.
day of March, 1791, "for ascertaining the boundary line between
this commonwealth and the state of Rhode Island."
The report of April 13th, 1750, states, that the commissioners on the
part of the colony of Massachusetts met the gentlemen appointed on
behalf of the colony of Rhode Island, on the 10th of April, 1750,
"and spent part of that and the next succeeding day in debating on
said affair with those gentlemen ;" and produced the agreement of
1710, 1711. "Sundry plans, &c. were offeredto run and review with
them the said line, but they refused to go, or join us herein, but
insisted on our going with them to a certain place on Charles river,
in Wrentham, from which they a few months since measured three
miles south, and then extended a West line with the variation west,
to the west bounds of that colony, as they claim as the west bounds
of that colony, as they informed us; which bounds they claim as
their north bounds; and is about four or five miles northward from
Woodward and Saffrey's station."
The report also states, "that on
the return of the commissioners to the place of meeting, the Rhode
Island commissioners not having accompanied the Massachusetts
commissioners to the station, they found them at the original place
of meeting, who desired the commissioners would adjourn to a
second meeting, which was assented to, and the meeting fixed at

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.)

the same place, in October following, in case their respective governnients consented thereto."
The seccud report was made by "The commissioners on the part
of Massachusetts, to the legislature of that state, Feb. 21, 17920."1
It is stated to be a report "that the commissioners appointed by an
act of the legislature of the c'ommonwealth of Massachusetts, passed
on the 8th day of March, 1791, for ascertaining the boundary line
between this commonwealth and the state of Rhode Island, have
carefully attended the services assigned them, and take leave to report
their doings."
The report states, "that on the 15th of August, 1791, we, by
agreement, met the commissioners from the state of Rhode Island,
at Wrentham, in this commonwealth, and after exchanging the
powers under which we severally acted, we proceeded to discuss
the subject that gave rise to our appointments, in the course of which,
it appeared that the state pf Rhode island, from their construction
of this expression, ' three miles south of Charles river, or of any and
,every part thereof,' in the ancient charter of the colony of,MasSachusetts, and as the, south bounds of the same, claim near three
miles north upon this commonwealth, than the present line of jurisdiction between the two governments; the commissioners of the
commonwealth, from the circumstance that the branch, now :alled
Charles river, and f-om which the claim of the state of Rhode. Island
would run three miles south to ascertain the south boundary of the
commonwcalth, could not have been known by the name of Charles
at the time of granting the Massachusetts charter in 1621; and from
this line being ascertained and fixed at a different place by commissioners' chosen by the colonies of Massachusetts and.New Plymouth,
in 1667, at a time when the intentions of the grantor and grantees
must have been known, are convinced that the claim of the state of
Rhode Island is ill founded; but to complete, if po'ssible, the intentions.of our appointments, and that the disputes between the governments might be amicably adjusted, we united with the commissioners of the state of Rhode Island, in the agreement as innumber one.
"In examining and comparing the charter of the two goverrments, granted by the successive kings of England, under which
both claim, it appears that the first charter to the colony of Massachusetts was granted by King James the First, in 1621, and resigned
a certain territory to that colony, bounded by an east and west line,
which was, to be three miles south of Charles river, or of any and
every part thereof; the same expression is also used fcr limiting a
part of the bounds of the old colony of Plymouth, and was probably
copied from their charter into the Massachusetts, to prevent an interference of claims; the same line is adopted in the charter from King
Charles the Second, to the colony of Rhode Isand, granted in 1663,
and- is their northern boundary. The erection of a third government, referring to the ame bounds, seems to have rendered it necessary for Plymouth and Massachusetts to ascertain their bounds; 'accordingly those two governinents, in 1664, appointed commissioners

to survey the most southern branch of the Charles river, and to lay
off from thence three miles due south as their boundary line by
charter; this was' accordingly done, and they fixed upon a large
.tree, then known and since noted by the name of the Angle tree, as
the north line of Plymouth, and the south line of Massachusetts.
The knowledge and name of the place, is preserved, and the commonwealth, in order to perpetuate it, have erected in the place of
the tree, the remains of which are now to be seen, an handsome
stone monument, which bears the name of Angle tree, and is explained by suitable inscriptions on'the different faces of it. This
the commissioners apprehend to have been the true and original
boundary, and is three miles south of the most southerly Wvaters of
Charles river: It does not appear that the colony of Rhode Island
ever expressed any dissatisfaction respecting their notthern boundary until 1716, or thereabouts, which finally endea in the appointment of commissioners by both governments in 1718, who fixed a
new station about two miles north of the Angle tree, and which was
called after the surveyors, ' Woodward and Saffrey's Station.' This
place is well known, although no records of it have been preserved,
or the proceedings of the commissioners ratified by either government; yet the line drawn from it has been practised upon as the
line of jurisdiction between the governments from that to the present time. This commonwealth then lost two miles in width along
the northern line of Rhode Island, and seems to have acquiesced in
the agreement upon principles of generosity. The ancient charter
of New Plymouth and Rhode Island were irregularly bounded on
one an6ther: the former, as was supposed, by the shores of the Narraganset bay, the latter by three miles east of those shores; this
interference of boundary, however, appears not to have given any
discontent, as the date of the charter of New Plymouth was prior
to that of Rhode Island; and the peaceful jurisdiction to the shores
of Narraganset bay, was enjoyed not only by the old colony of
Plymouth, but by Massachusetts, (after these two colonies were
united by the charter of 1691,) down to the year 1730, at which

time the colony of Rhode Island passed an act claiming the jurisdiction of the territory on their eastern boundary, granted to them, by
charter, in this act and in the subsequent dispute and determination.
of the'sulbject, not a claim, nor the intimation of one, but that their
northern boundary was satisfactory, as established in 1718. In 1740,
the King of Great Britain, who was then the sovereign of these
states, appointed commissioners to hear and determine the dispute
then existiig between the governments, who, after hearing the parties, came to the determination as in number two, by which the extent
of Rhode Island charter'was allowed, and the jurisdiction of Massachusetts cut off from the shores of Narraganset bay. This judgmetit, unexpqcted-by either party, was disapproved of by both, and
they accordingly appealed to the king in council, whore, however,
it was ratified in 1746. ,As soon as this information was received
bv"the colony of Rhode Island, they proceeded to appoint their

commissioners, and assigned the time of meeting for them to begin
running the lines that had thus been determined, and they gave
,information thereof to the gqvernor of, this their province; but the
legislature not being convened until some time after the period
affixed for the Rhode Island commissioners to begin the survey,
they thought it unnecessary for them to join in the commissio).
These lines, we perambulated in company with the commissioners
of the tate of Rhode Island, and excepting one or two stations
between Providence and Bristol, which were well ascertained,. we
found, that they, had. encroached upon this commonwealth from onequarter to three-quarters of a mile in width. We were attended by
suitable persons, approved by both parties, for making the necessary
observations and surveys. Here, probably, all further dispute relative to boundary lines with the colony of Rhode Island would have
forever ended, had it not have been for the rage of political parties
at this time within that colony; one of which, to effect a decided
majority, was extremely anxiotus for an extension of northern jurisdiction. Influenced by these motives, and perhaps. in some measure
by their late success, they, in 1740, brought forward a new Plaini
for extending their northern boundary beyond the line established
in 1718; and to support that claim, they appointed commissioners
in 1750, to examige what is now called Charles river, and froin the
most southern part of. the same, to survey off three miles as the
boundary of Massachusetts, agreeably to their charter. A plan of
this survey was laid before u§, and copy of it herewith presented.
We have inserted our own survey of what we conceive to.be the
most southern part of Charles river, as intended by the charter, above
Whiting's pond, and the position of the Angle tree. It may not be.
unnecessary to observe, that at the southern head of what we call
.Charles river, is a place known by a large chesnut trep; ,thence the
stream descends to Whiting's pond, where it forms a considerable
lake, and after wards resuming its proper shape, (and now known
by the name, of. Mill river or brooke,) pursues its course in a northerly direction till it joins that stream which is known by the name
of Charles' river, the confluence of the two streams six- miles more
northerly than the chesnut tree at the southern head of Charles;
after perambulating the bounds now practised upon, and ascertainingtheir deviations from the stations to which they ought to have
been fixed, and learning, the principles upon which Rhode Island
supports her claims, and the extent of them, we adjourned to the
5th day of December last, then to meet at Providence, In the state
of Rhode Island; at which time and place we met with the commissioners from ,Rhode Island, and after fully*discussing the several
claims, and endeavouring to conciliate the difference between the
two- states, agreeably to the powers of oar commission, we were
convinced that no agreement can be made at present with them,
unless we yield a valuable territory, to which they have no claim,
and which we hold not only by repeated,charters, but by the agreemeat of the state of Rhode Island in 171,8), and. so far from its ap-

pearing that encroachments have been made by this commonwealth
on that state, that thecontrary is notoriously the fact."
The counsel of the' 'state of Massachusetts, after January term,
1839, and in conformity with the order and leave of the Court then
given, filed a plea and answer to the amended bill of the state of
Rhode Island,' The plea and answer were the same, in all importantparticulars, as that originally filed at January term, 1834. The
plea and answer c'onclude,-" And "the defendant saith that there is
no other matter or thing in the complainant's said bill of complaint
contained, material for this defendant to make answer unto, and to
which said defendant has not already pleaded and answered as
aforesaid; all which matters and things pleaded and answered, as
aforesaid, the defendant i ready to verify and maintain as the Court
shall order. Wherefore said defendant prays to be hence dismissed,
with costs,"
All the 'matters in the bill, material in this case, and in the plea
and answer, with the exception of the amendments given on pages
213-215, ante, are stated fully in the report of the case in 12 Peters, 657; and ihthe opinion of the Court delivered at this term, by
Mr. Chief Justice TANFY.

The case was before the Court, on the sufficiency of the plea
and answer. It was argued by Mr. Hazard and Mr. Whipple, for
-the state of Rhode Island ; arid by Mr. Austin,. altorney-general of
Massachusetts, and Mr. Webster, for the defendant,
Before the argument was proceeded in, a question arose between
the counsel in the case, on the right of the counsel for the complainants to begin and conclhde the argument.
The Court held, that by.a rut of the Court, the practice of the
English.Courts of Chancery is the practice in the Courts of Equity
of the United States. On looking into the books of practice in the
English Courts of 'Chancery; it appears that the party who puts in
the plea which is the subject of discussion, has the right to begin
and conclude the argument. The same rule should prevail in the
Coutts of the United States, in Chancery proceedings.
Mr. Austin for the state of Massachusetts.
The question before the Court is on the SuffiCiency of the plea in
bar to the plaintiff's demand, both for discovery and relief. The
plea is open to any just exception, either as to its form or substance;
but as it purports to be an answer or bar to the plaintiff's complaint, its sufficidncy must materially depend on the structure of the
bill in which that complaint is set forth. Any answer is sufficient
to a bill which is so frame( as to require none. The respondent
contends that this opens, substantially, the whole merits of the ease.
Bogardus vs.: Trinity Church, 4 Paige, 178.
The sufficiency of the plea is very different from the truth of it.
For the purpose of the present inquiry, all its allegations are to be
taken to be true. If the plaintiff denies any of them, lie has another

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

mode of proceeding: it, is Understood also, that all allegations
made in the bill, and denied by the plea, are, for this hearing, to be
taken according to the plea, and not according to the statement of
them in the bill: and it is admitted, that whatever is stated in the
bill, and not controverted by the plea, is in this stage of the cause
to be taken as true. If, under these circumstances, the plea leaves
the plaintiff without a sufficient cause for -discovery and relief, it
has answered its office, and must be sustained. The case seems to
the respondent in no material degree to differ from a general demurrer to the bill; except only that the allegations of the plea control those of the bill, and are admitted to be true pro hac vice only.
Before the sufficiency of the plea can be ascertained, the matter
to be answered must be examined and understood. The bill sets
forth the plaintiff's title. It is of a form adopted, not very remotely,
into the practice of Chancery; and requiring, or at.least admitting,
what the books call, without much propriety, an anomalous or irregular plea; thus applying terms to the plea, which in fact belong
to the bill., It introduces, in anticipation, the subject matter of the
defence, and attempts to avoid the effect of it, by special allegations.
Substantially, the bill enumerates and recites the letters patent of
the council established at Plymouth in 1621: the deed of said
council to Sir Henry Roswell and others, of 19th March, 1628: the
first charter of Massachusetts, in 1629, by Charles I. From all
these, one fact only is material, and that is notin dispute at all, viz.
that Massachusetts became a colony of the British crown, at the
settlement of it by the pilgrims; and that its southern boundary line
first mentioned in the letters patent of 1621, and repeated in the
words whenever occasion required, was by "all those landes and
hereditaments whatsoever, lyeing within the space of three Englishe
myles on the south parte of the saide River, called Charles river, or
any or every parte thereof."
It is obvious from these public papers, the effect of which is adritted by both parties, that the southern boundary of Massachusetts was described with sufficient accuracy; and the only matter to
be done to fix it with perfect certainty, was to run on the earth, and
through the then uninhabited wilderness, the line described in the
charter.
The bill proceeds, after referring to the surrender of the letters
patent of the council of Plymouth, in 1635, 17th June, and the
planting and purchasing of what now is the territory of Rhode
Island ; which facts are not- material or controverted; to recite the
charter of the colony of Rhode Island, granted by Charles II. on
the 8th July, 1643, whereby Rhode Island is bounded "northerly
on the said south or southerly line of Massachusetts."
The bill states also, the dissolution of the first charter of Massachusetts, by the Court of Chancery in England, the new charter of
William and Mary, in October 1691, re-establishing on this line, the
ancient boundary in the same words, and the Declaration of Independence
of the United States: documents not essential to any conVOL. XIV..-T

troverted point in this suit; unless it.
be) as before was contended-by
the attorney general of Massachusetts, and now again respectfully
insisted upon, that the Declaration of Independence repealed all
these charters, and established the several former colonies in their
new character of sovereign and independent states, by the line and
boundary actually enjoyed and possessed by them respectively, on
the-day, of their political nativity, the 4th of,July, 1776.
All these documents not controverted by the plea, and not to be
denied with truth, are admitted with all their legitimate consequences. The bill. then proceeds to state, that disputes had arisen,
not in regard to any charter, or where the line ought to be drawn
in conformity with the ,provision of those instruments; but where
on the earth's surface a line corresponding with the charters should
be described. It sets forth the appointment of commissioners by
each colony,:" to settle the boundary, line ;" the meeting of those
commissioners; and their unanimous agreement, certified under
their hands on the 19th January, 1710, 1711 ; "that a stake set up
by N. Woodward, and S. Saffrey, in 1642, and since often renewed,
in latitude 410, 55', being thre~e English miles. distant southard from
the southernmost part of Charles river, agreeably to the-letters
patent for the Massachusetts province, be accompt, d and allowed
on both sides the commencement of the line," &c.
The commissioners having thus ascertained a point of beginning,
and it being necessary to p rotract the line from that- point which
they did not do at that time; the bill recites the appointment of
other commissioners by the two colonies, and their meeting at Rehoboth, on the 22d Otober, 1718, to protract the -line; the fact that
they reaffirmed the correctness of the place of beginning, ran the
line as. described by them, certified their proceedings under the
hands and seals of a majority of their whole number, and of the
delegation of each colony; and that the General Assembly of Rhode
Island, passed a resolution on the 26th October, 1718, ordering that
the return be accepted, and placed to record in the colony books.
It seemed to the counsel of. Massachusetts, that if the bill had
stopped here, there would be nothing for the respondents .to answer; because it is everywhere admitted in the bill, that the line
thus run, is that to which Massachusetts laid claim before Rhode
Island was in exjstence; the line to which Massaehusdtts was
possessed, and over all: territory north of which she was in the
actual exercise of jurisdiction, when the charter of Rhode Island
was granted; and that is all she had ever claimed, or now claims
in that direction, by charter, possession, or title of any kind. It
would seem, too, that both parties to this suit admitted the line by
the charter; that they intended to describe on the earth-the line
so designated in the 'charter; that they did so by commissioners
mutually appointed on two different occasions, at the interval of
seven years; and, that the pl&intiff had accepted and recorded their
proceedi'gs, as satisfactory and conclusive, at the time, now more
than one hundred and twenty years ago.

Btft the plaintiff having thus ithsered the bar matter in his bill,
proceeds to give his answer to it. It is obvious, therefore, that to
this answer, and to so much of this answe'r only as is material to
set aside the bar matter, isthe respondent bound to reply.. The
plaintiff has furnished for the respondent a sufficient defence: he
has set up a bar to his own further proceedings; and unless he, removes the bar of his own procuring, the respondent has no need to
make any reply. What then, is the allegation in the bill, Which professes to be sufficient to countervail an agreement of this -sort; and
of possession in conformity with such agreement for more than a
century ?
In the, first place, it is apparent in the bill, and distinctly admitted
by the learned counsel of Rhode Island, that no fraud is charged to
anybody in these transactions; but it is alleged that the parties
acted under a mistake. It is averred, that the commissioners of
Massachusetts, believing, no doubt, that the point which they designated as Woodward and Saffrey's station,, was three miles, and
no more, from Charles river, affirmed to the Rhode Island commissioners, that it was the proper place of beginning for the line, and
that the Rhod .Island commissioners, taking the word of the
Massachusetts commissioners for true, or searching for themselves
and coming to the same conclusion,'or examining the map the, -'
before them, made by Woodward and Saffrey, were of the same
opinion, and jumped together in judgment: and that the commissioners of the two colonies, in 1718, in running out the line, were
actuated by the, same meadis, and established the line, which, as
ever before, so ever since, has been the actual line of division
between these neighbouring sovereignties. And that in all this,
without fraud or misrepresentation,,there is, nevertheless, a fatal
mistake.
It -is
admitted that all parties acquiesced in the doings of the commissioners until 1749, more'than thirty years; when Rhode Island
discovered, as is alleged, that the stake of Woodward and Saffrey
was more than three miles, viz., seven miles from Charles river; and
that the Rhode Island commissioners, and the Rhode Island legislatire, acting under this mistake, are not bound. by the treaty, compromise, arbitration, or award, and have now a right to claim for
that cause by the intervention of this honourable Court, to set aside
the'onventions of 1710 and 1718, and re-examine and adjust the
boundary on :their present information; and by the letter of their
ancient charters, as they are now understood by the plaintiff.
The residue of the bill recites the 6x parte proceedings of Rhode
Island, to determine the .true line, independent of the agreements
of 1710 and 1718, and the various attempts made to induce Massachusetts to re-open the matter; all which were ineffectual, as is con.
fessed by the fact, distinctly admitted, that for all time since Massachusetts has been a government, colonial, provincial, federative,
or sovereign, she has had the actual, undisturbed, quiet possession

(The State of Rhode Island vs, The State of Massachusetti.]

and occupation, jurisdiction and control of and over the premises in
dispute.
Now itseems to the counsel of the respondent, that to this complaint, thus set, forth, a demurrer might safely have been filed; and
that to a bill to whidh a demurrer would be sustained, any plea or
answer must be deemed sufficient. Such bill contains its own answer. It incorporates the defence: and whatever else may be said
of 'the plea, it cannot be deemed inadequate or insufficient for the
defence
But the respondent is unwilling that the record should contain
only the plaintiff's coloured view of the treaty, covenant, or arbitrament, entered into in 1710 and 1718. However safe it would be to
admit such a mistake as the plaintiff alleges, yet the facts afford a
stronger ground; and the respondent avails himself of it.
The plea, therefore, to the substance of which the attention of the
Court is now solicited; takes from the plaintiff's bill the whole subject of the proceedings of the commissioners in 1710 and 1718, and
treating of each of them severally, avers that the "whole real and
true merits of said complainant's supposed cause or causes of action,
claims, grievances, and complaints, set forth and supposed in said
bill of complaint, were fully beard, tried, and determined, in the
hearing and by the judgment of said commissioners; that the agreement was fair, legal, and binding between the 'parties, and was, in
all particulars, a valid and effectual settlement of the matter in controversy; and- was had and made without covin, fraud, or misrepresentation, and with a. full and equal knoWledge of all circumstances
by both parties; and that the same is still in full force, in no way
waived, abandoned, or relinquished; that the station called Woodward and Saffrey's station, was then well known, the place where it
was fixed of common notoriety, and the line run therefrom, as aforesaid, capable of being discovered and renewed; that the said defendant has held and possessed, occupied and enjoyed the land, property, and jurisdiction, according to said station and line running
therefrom, from the date of said agreement to the present time, without hinderance or molestation."
It is certainly true, that the plea does not undertake to say that the
Woodward and Saffrey.station is three miles southwardly o4 Charles
river, and no more. It does not put in issue, whether now a revision of the line, according to the charter, would describe the same
plaee.
If the plans exhibited in this case, either by Rhode Island or
Massachusetts, are correct, no revision could alter the line; for it is
clearly within three miles of one of the branches of that river; and
the only question would be, whether the charter, by the terms in it,
viz., "on tne south part of Charles river, or of any or every part
thereof," meant to include one of the forks as partof the river, or
not. But the geographical and historical facts, which are notorious,
and, of course, to be taLer notice of by the Court, (one of which

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

221

(The State of Rhole Island vs. The State of Masaehusetts.]

both these maps prove,) are important in the case. Charles river
had never been explored in 1642 by any European, and its borders
were occupied only by savages. Woodward and Saffrey went there
to determine the river; the offset of three miles; and the line of
boundary. It is very immaterial how they determined it. ,
The stream called Charles river acquired that name not from nature, but man. When and what was called, Charles, became
Charles ; what was called part of the river, was, for all human purposes, thenceforth known and notorious as part of the river. They
fixed their station within three miles of water flowing into the main
stream. They found or they called this water Charles river. If it
was unquestioned, it must have been conclusive. If it was questionpd or questionable, if after Rhode Island came into existence,
and in 1710, near seventy years after the naming of this'water by
Woodward and Saffrey,it was brought into question byRh ode Island,
it was then a proper subject of settlement, compromise, and agreement for the commissioners; and their decision settled the matter
conclusively for all after time. It was the very question they met
to settle; and their opinion, judgment, and award, made it what they
determined it to be.
The respondent contends, first, that it is not necessary to the sufficiency of the plea, to controvert or notice in any way the suggestion of a mistake.
Secondly, That mistake or no mistake are substantially and sufficiently put in issue by the plea, so that the plaintiff may join the
issue there tendered, if he pleases.
On the first point, it is respectfully submitted, that where a party
alleges a proceeding to be had under a mistake of fact or law, and
sets forth the circumstances in which he supposes the mistake to
exist, if by the circumstances so stated it is apparent that there was
no mistake, the allegation may be treated as a nullity. The legal
inference from the matter so stated, and not the term applied to it,
must regulate the pleading of the adverse party; and the decision of
the Court. Story Eq. Pl. § 680, and note.
The plaintiff sets forth his circumstances of supposed mistake.
They are these; Massachusetts being in possession of a line of
boundary, Rhode Island complains, and propgses a joint commission
to settle it. Commissioners meet.. Governor Dudley, on the part of
Massachusetts, tells Lieutenant Governor Jenckes, of Rhode Island,
that the true point is the Woodward and Saffrey station. Governor
Jenckes, either knowing that fact himself, before; or in some other
way being convinced, agrees to it, and signs an award fixing that
station as the point of beginning.

Nine years after, the same thing

is repeated by other commissioners, and the whole line run from
that point. The bill does not allege that the Rhode Island commissioner believed the station to be the true one, because Governor
Dudley told him s6; but avers that he did believe the fact, which
being the very thing he was commissioned to ascertain, it must at
T2

this distant day be supposed, that he believed it on sufficient and
satisfactory
examination.
It is obvious
that in this, by the plaintiff's own showing, is
no
mistake, as that term is understood in equity.
. When negotiators meet to decide a question, it is impossible but
that one must make an assertion to the other, which, after the lapse
of an hundred years, the generation of the then present period may
deem wrong in point of fact. So of arbitrators or referees. If a
decision that should appear to the heirs of a remote ancestor to be
wrong,could be reinvestigated on the allegation of the losing party,
that the verdict or judgment was a mistake, (which every losing
litigant is ready enough to make,) there could be no end to lawstits:
and the decision which this Court may pronounce in this case, may,
on the same principle, be revived an hundred years, hence, by a
suggestion that there was a mistake in the forming of it.
It is impossible that any declaration made by Governor Dudley
one hundred and thirty. years ago, could be known now; and the
suggestion of the plaintiff, in this regard, must be a mere fancysketch.. The allegation, if made, could be only the declaration of
an opinion.
Gov. Dudley died in 1720, aged seventy-three years. 1 Holmes'
Annals, 525.
The fact referred to occurred in 1642, five or six years before lie
was born.
The statement of an opinion is no misrepresentation. Scott vs.
Hanson, 1 Simon's Rep. 13. Such a statement is not calculated to
deceive, but rather to put the opposite party on his guard. Trower
vs. Newcomb, 3 Meiivale,,704. Ignorance, which might have been
remedied by due diligence and inquiry, is no cause for relief. Perry
vs. Martin, 4 John's Chan. R. 566. And Lord Loughborough has
emphatically said, ignorance is not mistake.
If 'the Rhode Island commissioner acted on such representation,
supposing it was made, and if it was false, yet his action is not to
be considered as founded in a mistake, as that term is understood in
equity; because the relations of the two commissioners was not such
as to induce one to place a known trust in the other; but the contrary. Fox vs. Mackrith, 2 Bro. Ch. Ca. 420. Smith vs. The Bank

. If there
was no false representation; if the Rhode Island commissioner believed a< fact, the truth of which it was his special duty to
investigate, and which he had the means of investigating: and all
this appears by the plaintiff's bill, the judgment and the award was
not mistake, but conviction. The plaintiff, by calling it a mistake,
cannot change the rule of pleading, or of equity;. and. it -may be
teped as a misnomer or a nullity,

in furthbr--considering' this' allegation of mistake, the great ques.
tions arise, in what relation or capacity did the present plaintiff and
respondent stand to each other at that time ? What was the,capacity of the commissioners by whom the line was run? and what is
the law of a case so situated?
If the parties now before the Court stand here as common suitors,
corporations, or individuals, controverting the boundary of an'estate,
and these commissioners are.referees or arbitrators mutually chosen
to decide the controversy; then the rules regulating the proceedings
of an arbitrament and award at common law or equity, may well
enough. be invoked, to determine the question befoie the Court.
But in this.view, the mistake of law or fact, the wrong judgment
and. erroneous decision of arbitrators, do.not authorize the re-opening and re-examining their proceedings. Knox vs. Symonds' 1 Ves.
Jr. 369, South Sea Co. vs. Bumstead, 2 Eq. P1. Ab. 8. 1Shephard

Wood- vs. Griffith, I Swans. 55. Auriol vs. Smith, 1 Turner and
Russ. 125. Goodwin vs. Sayres, 2 Jacob and Walker's Rep. 249.
These cases go the whole length of establishing the position, that
the mistake of the arbitrator on a matter of fact or law referred to
him, cannot be inquired into; or rather, that his -judgment and opinion make the rule, and there is no authority above him competent
to say that his decision is a mistake. Lord Commissioner Wilsonii
one of the cases (Morgan vs. Mathews) says," It would be a melancholy thing if, because We differ from arbitrators in point of fact, we
should set aside awards." And Lord Chancellor Eldon, in Ching
vs. Ching, states in strong terms, "If a question of law is referred
to an arbitrator, he must dpcide it; and though he decides wrong,
you cannot help it."
The case is different where arbitrators, conscious of a mistake,
desire to rectify -it; because, in that position, the supposed decision
is not their judgment: and this consideration reconciles any cases
ot a seemingly different character from those above cited.
This supposed mistake may, however, even on the strict.rules of
equity practice, be passed, without notice in the plea, because the
allegationof the plaintiff renders it invalid by lapse of time. It is
of ancient date, and from that ( recumstance impossible to beascertained; or if ascertained, to have any present operatiom
Coarts of Equity, by their own rules, independent of any statute

Now, though the question before the Court assumes to be one of
pleading, and not of equity, yet it is maintained by the respondent,
that a plea is sufficient which leaves no material matter unanswered;
that what is not answered redounds to the benefit of the plaintiff;
and if this mistake is not answered, it may count for him valeat
quantum. But if it is in itself immaterial, and of state characteir,
it may-be passed over without notice, because it can in no shape
make out a case for the plaintiff.
Secondly, the respondent contends, "that all which the strictest rule
of equity pleading requires in this case is met by the allegation in
the plea, that the "said agreement was fair, legal, and binding between the parties,without covin, fraud, or misrepresentation, and with
a full and equal knowledge of all circumstances by both parties."
This allegation is not now controverted: and it seems to the respondent's counsel impossible to say, that with a full and equal knowledge
of both parties, their unanimous determination of the question submitted to them could be a mistake relievable in equity.
To the form of the plea no exception is taken by the learned
counsel for the plaintiff; but he contends, that it is novel and insufficient in this, that it pleads possession as a bar, and not title. To
an action at common law or at equity, where the usual statute of
limitations applied, this exception might, if well taken in point of
fact, cause some besitation. But it is not founded in a correct estimation of the character of the plea.. The respondent, in his plea in
bar, asserts his title to the territory in dispute, and derives it from
the joint effect of the agreements of 1710 and 1718, and possession
under them forever. It may be, that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, neither the agreement, if made ag4inst the letter
of the charters; nor possession, if held adversely and without consent, could sustain 'the respondent's claim: nor is it material to
inquire how this Would be, because in truth and fact the title of the
respondent rests ou neither one of those pillars alone, but on both;
upholding, strengthening, confirming, and supporting each other,
and forming together a foundation of irresistible strength. They
have not been separated for more than a century; and Gught not to
be separated now in the matter before the Court. The true chigracter of the plea is, title derived in part from two sources, and concentrating into one p6int, that of indefeasible- right. 1 Chitty's
Pleading, 512-, and the cases there collected.
But before this plea can be overruled for any technical exception
of this or any other sort, the Court will come to the consideration
of a much more important and interesting question than yet has been
presented; full of novelty and grandeur, and suited to the cause, the
parties, and the Court.
The question thus presented is this: By what code of laws, by
what forms of proceeding, by what principles of judicial construction, is this controversy to be settled? It is impossible not to per-

JANUARY TERM,

225

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusett*]

ceive, that the case before the Court is not one of'ordinary judicial
cognisance. It is not the boundary of a farm or a water lot that is
in dispute, but the limit of a nation. It is not a question of ownership in the soil that is presented, but of jurisdiction over a territory
and its inhabitants. The parties, too, are not ordinary suitors in a
Court of justice i they are states, called by the plaintiff "sovereign
states;" and standing in that relation to each other, before this high
tribunal, which, like the ancient Areopagus, is to adjudicate on the
tranquillity and peace of mankind.
The Court, on solemn consideration, has decided, that on these
great interests of territorial jurisdiction and state sovereignty, and
on the transfer of the allegiance of five thousand people from one
civil government to another, essentially. different in many Qf its
institutions, customs, and, laws, it has a constitutional power to pronounce judgment and decree justice. Be it so: this point is not now
to be controverted. But whence does the Court derive this power?
Not from its ordinary judicial authority; not as a branch of that
prerogative by which it is to decide "cases in law and equity;"
but by a special provision of the Constitution, for the' administering
of which no forms are provided; a power above and beyond the
reach of any 9ther judicial tribunal in the world; wholly without
precedent in the principles of the civijl, the canon, or the common
law; and vesting in this high tribunal .a discretion and authority,
which yet has been limited by no legislation of 'Congress, nor by any
rules or acts of its own.
In a case where "the file affords no precedent," and there is
neither common nor statute law to guide the proceedings of the
Court, the counsel of the respondent respectfully contends, that the
case brings with it into this tribunal its own law, in the principles
of an elevated and perfect justice, unfettered-as in tbeir nature
they are incapable of being fettered-by technical sttbtleties and
petty for..
It stands upon those great and fundamental doctrines
of international law, which, by the common consert of mankind, are
the basis of the intercourse of the civilized world.
The high Aemand of the plaintiff is, that your honours will "restoreand confirm to him his violated rights of jurisdiction and sovereignty." These are rights which no private party ever could possess, and over which no other judicial tribunal ever held jurisdiction.
The light which is to guide the conscience of the Court in this new
field, comes not from books of pleading, or reports of adjudicated
cases between citizens or subjects. Such matters belong not tQ
them. It is to be found only in the source of eternal justice, as it
comes from. intelligence and truth.
The case, examined in the character which it thus properly
assumes, however important in principle, is one of easy solution.
The parties to the suit were once colonies of Great IBri ain., The
relation thus sustained is matter of pablic history, and familiar to
the Court. Nominally in a state of vassalage,,they were in reality
free; and professing a formal ailegiance to the British crown, actu29

ally assumed and exercised the prerogatives of, sovereignty. They
made war and' peace;, coined money; entered, into confederacies;
and'made tretties of alliance, offensive and defensive, with each
other. 'Theproceedings in 1710 terminated in a treaty of boundary,
differing in nothing from that of 1783 between Geat Britain and
the United States, except in extent. No earthly power but the contracting parties ever attempted -to interfere with it. It was made by
negotiators of each party, With unlimited powers to compromise and
settle the boundary. The terms are plain and incontrovertible.
Th6 treaty, thus made, established the station of Woodward and
Saffrey in latitude 41O 55', to 'be three English miles from Charles
river, and "that, agreeable to the letters patent for the Massachusetts province, it'be accompted and allowed on both sides the commencement of the line between: Massachusetts and the colony of
Rhode Island."
It is obvious from the whole of the plaintiff's bill, that this treaty
only confirmed and established what had always before been admitted in point of fact.
In 1718 another treaty was negotiated, confirming the treaty of
1710, and more fully carrying it into effect.
These titles to the territoryi founded on the solemn faith of two
formal treaties, under and by -force of which the respondent has
always held "unmolested possession," arepresented to this Court"
thus held over sovereigns, on a question exclusively of international
law, as a bar in equity and justice to further molestation and disturbance.
Whether,'being negotiated between colonies, they-are entitled by
the law of nations to be termed treaties, or only conventions, agreements, or pactions, they are by that law equally sacred. Vattel,
193, § 14, 155; 227, § 215.
S'Why are they not binding? The suggestion in the plaintiff's bill,
that they were notratified by the mother country, is a poor attempt
at self-stultification. They needed no ratification., They were not
repudiated by Great Britain; and, like' all acts of the colonies, were
in force until disallowed. If it were otherwise, it would be more
consistent with the high character of our esteemed fellow-citizens
of Rhode Island to imitate the Roman honour of the Consul Fabius
Maximus, who, when the senate would not ratify his agreement
with the enemy, sold his private property-to make good his word:
or that other Consul, Postumius, who, because the senate would not
confirm his treaty with the Samnites, adjudged that he himself and
his colleagues should be delivered into their hands.
The answer to all this by Rhode Island is, that 'the negotiators
made a mistake. To this the reply 'is, that it is denied in the plea.
But if the allegation be admitted, the mistake of negotiators never
was, and on principle never can be, a just cause for violating the
stipulations of a treaty. Of this principle the diplomatic history of
the United States is full of examples, and conforms to the diplomacy
of civilized Europe,-

Possession,-or as it is called in books on international 'law, usucaption, for a long period of time, is the best evidence of a national
right. Vattel, 187. 191, &c.
The possession of Massachusetts began before Rhode Island was
created, and has never been interrupted for a day. This is an insuperable bar to the long delayed claim of the plaintiff. Of itself,
it is invincible. The-only arqswer to it now,'is, that it is joined with
another title, equally strong, which two are not to be united in the
same plea. One reply to this objection has already been given;
but there is a stronger one in the present aspect of the case. Under
the law of nations, forms cannotr obstruct justice. There are no
technicalities; and no Common Pleas practice, in a Congress of
nations; nor can any be admitted before this august tribunal, sitting
under its high constitutional commission, to settle the rights of sovereignties, and to administer justice in political controversies between
independent states.
Mr. Hazard, with whom was Mr. Whipple, for the state of Rhode
Island.
I had endeavoured to prepJe myself to argue the questions of
law Which the state of the pleadilngs presented to the Court; intending to confine myself strictly to those questions, that I might not trespass upon the time or patience of the Court. I did not anticipate,
for I could-not believe that the defendant's counsel "would, himself,
bring into view the merits of the main cause, in a trial upon his
own plea in bar to those merits, interposed to prevent their being put
in issue' or tried. But, finding myself mistaken in this, it becomes
necessary for me to pay some attention to the statements made by
the counsel, lest he should consider them as being acquiesced in.
The facts staten in the plaintiff's bill, we think, constitute a good
cause fqr the relief asked for. And we believe that we can prove
those facts. The defendant, while, by his pleading, he excludes
those facts from the issue and from trial, himself makes statements
which we are not permitted to disprove ; because they also are excluded by him from'the issue and from trial. But there is this distinction between the statements made by the respective parties.
The defendant has no right to state facts which he refuses to put in
issue, or have tried. But, it would not be departing from the merits
of the law question of the sufficiency of the plea in bar, for the
plaintiff to show the mraterial facts he would be able to prove, if
inot precluded by the defects of the plea. At present, however, I
ask leave to appeal to facts, only so far as may be necessary to correct the erroneous statements made by the defendant.
I understood the'counsel to say, that he resorted to the merits of
the cause, and to one of the charges in our bill, for the purpose of
showing that, at the time of the Roxbury agreement of 1710, 1711,
there was a serious misunderstanding between the parties as to
what was the most southerly part of Charles river, at the distance
of three English miles south from which the southern boundary

228 '

[The State of Rhode Island vs, The State of Massachusetts.]

line of Massachusetts was to be ,run east and west, agreeably to her
charter; Rhode Island claiming to measure from Charles river
proper, as it is now known; while -Massachusetts insisted upon
taking the head of a brook, called Jack's Pasture brook, or Mill
brook, as the most southerly part of Charles river; and that this misunderstanding led to a compromise which was effected by the agreement at Roxbury. But the charge referred to negatives instead of
countenancing this supposition. For it speaks of the pretence about
Jack's Pasture brook, as one that is set up against the present claim
of Rhode Island, which was made upon Massachusetts, in 1748; and
has since been adhered to and prosecuted to the present time. But
besides this, it is plain from the reports of all the committees from
1710, 1711, and1718, to 1791, that Mill brook was never thought
of as in any way affecting the question of the boundary line, until the
idea occurred to, and was for the first time, started by the Massachusetts commnittee of that last year, 1791. . In the old reports of 1710,
1711, and 1718, no mention is made of any such brook; and it is not
likely-that the committees knew of its existence, for they took no
view even of Charles river itself. They adopted the supposed Woodward and Saffrey station, because set'up (they said) by skilful and
approved artists, so far back as 1642; and believed to be on the true
charter line. The same ground was taken by the Massachusetts
committee of 1750, which was appointed, as the report shows, to
run the line from the pretended Woodward and Saffrey stake. Not
to ascertain what was Charles river, nor where the true boundary
line was or ought to be, noi to run any such line. But, aftex the
Rhode Island committee of 1750 had by actual view and survey
ascertained the true charter line, and found that the line chalked out
by Massachusetts for herself, was really eight, instead of three miles
off from Charles river, and gave to that colony a part of the Rhode
island territory, averaging five miles, in breadth by twenty-three in
length; it'would not do any longer to rest upon the naked authority
of the ima~iuary. Woodward and Saffrey stake, which 'had been
acquiesced in, only because it had been asserted to be on the true
line, and nothing to the contrary was known. The Massachusetts
committee of 1791, therefore,,cast about for something to give a
colour of pretence for adhering to the old position, after it had been
thus exposed. And in their difficulty, they quit Charles river, and
run up into Mill brook, and through Whiting's pond, two and a
half miles off, and then into another brook still further on. Their
report (annexed to the bill) shows this. After mentioning that the
Rhode Island committee measured from Charles river as it now is,
they say, "we have inserted our own survey of what we conceive
to be the most southern part of Charles river," &c. And the report
then tells how they made the matter out, as has just been related.
Here it appears, that the pretence about Mill brook, was a new one,
and their own. They do not speak of it as having ever before been
thought of, but as a conception of their own.
The allegation, therefore, that there had been a dispute about this

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

229

[The State of Rhode Island w.The State of Massachusetts.]

brook, in 1710, 1711, which had led to a compromise then made, is
wholly unsuppprted and unfounded. Indeed, the idea that Charles
river ever could have been mistaken for Mill brook, or the brook for
the river, or that they ever could have been identified and taken
for one and the same, appears to me to be preposterous. Charles
river had its present name, the only name it has ever had, even
before the first settlement was made by the Massachusetts colony.
It was so named in the first charter, by King Charles I., to that
colony, in 1629. Whoever first went there and saw it, marked it
as one of the giat natural boundaries for the colony. A boundary
definite and permanent, about which there could be no uncertainty
or dispute. Having the broad river before their eyes, although in
the wilderness, and not far to be seen, it is not likely that they spied
out the particular tributary brook, much less that they groped tlhelr
way through the bushes and swamps, to see where it came from,
that they might nonour it; Whiting's pond, Jack's Pasture brook,
and all, up to the big chesnut tree, with the name of the king.
The counsd thinks that he sees evidence of a compromise in the
clause of the Roxbury agreement, leaving five thousand, or the
land within ore mile north, to the inhabitants of Providence or
others. But the committee assigned their own, and a different reason, for that clause; which was, that some of the inhabitants of
Providence had laid out lots there. But it is not pretended that
any notice was taken of that clause by the government of Rhode
Island, or that it was ever acted upon by either government. Again,
if the Roxbury committee had been making a compromise instead
of ascertaining and fixing the charter line; their report would have
shown it, and the grounds of it. They were-bound to show this;
for their respective legislatures had a right to know what they did,
and why they did it. Now, the report of this committee, on the
face of it, negatives the supposition of a compromise. It professes
to go by the charters ; and that the station agreed upon was on the
true charter line, and no more than three English miles from Charles
river. And so the General Assembly of Rhode Island was led to
believe; and not that any thing was done by way of compromise.
A singular compromise it would have been certainly, had it been
so intended ; by which Massachusetts took to herself five miles of
the Rhode Island territory, and in consideration thereof, allowed the
inhabitants of Providence or others, to retain the land within one
mile, but under her jurisdiction. Whether that territory does 'or
does not justly belong to Rhode Island, by her charter, and equally
so by the charter of Massachusetts, is the question which constitutes
the merits of the main cause; and can only be tried when those
merits are put in issue.
Some further disclosures are made in the report of trie Massachusetts committee of 1791, which ought not to be overlooked.
Having- mentioned, that Old Plymouth colony aid Rhode Island
had the same northern boundary on Massachusetts, the report says:
"The erection of a third government, roferring to the, same bounds,
VoW. XIV.-U

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

(the Rhode Island charter of 1663 had then just been granted,)
seems to have rendered it necessary for Plymouth and Massachusetts to ascertain their bounds." Accordingly commissioners were
then (in 1664,) appointed, who "fixed upon a large tree, called the
Anglb tree, as the north line of Plymouth and the south line of Massachusetts," &c. "This, (spys the report,) the commissioners apprehend to have been the true and original boundary; and is three
imles south of the most southerly part of Charles river." They
then mention the appointment of commissioners by Massachusetts
and Rhode Island, in 1718, "who fixed a new. station, about two
miles north of the angle tree," called Woodward and Saffrey station. "This commonwealth then lost two miles in width along the
northern-line of Rhode Island."
Thus these Massachusetts commissioners themselves falsify the
pretended Woodward and Saffrey station, which they call a "new
station," fixed upon in 1718. And it is a striking fact, that although
the settlement with Plymouth was onily twenty-two years after the
date now assigned to the Woodward and Saffrey station, yet, in
that settlement, not a word was said about any such station. The
plain inference is, either that none such existed, or that Massachusetts concealed it for the purpose of gaining two miles more upon
Plymouth; and that with a view to fixing a line for Rhode Island,
without giving Rhode Island any notice of her doings, or allowing
her to be a party to them. The probability is, that no such station
was ever heard of, until Colonel Dudley asserted that there was or
had been one. The report in my hand states, that no record of it
had been preserved. The Massachusetts committee of, 1750, say
that they found none; and it is plain from all the other reports that
none existed at their dates. Even Dudley himself did -not pretend
that he had ever seen any. And there is not in the whole case, a
particle of evidence that there ever was any such .station in exigtence.
It is necessary that I should now take one more look at this now
important Jack's Pasture, or Mill brook, and notice the use which
the Massachusetts committee of 1791, endeavoured to make of it;
and which the defendant endeavours to make of it, since it was
then brought into notice. That committee, in its report, says: "It
may not be unnecessary to observe, that at the northern head of
what we call Charles river, is a, place known by a large chesnut
tree; thence the stream descends to Whiting's pond, where it forms
a considerable lake, and afterwards resuming its proper shape, (and
now known by the name of Mill-river,'or brook,) pursues its course
in a northerly direction'till it joins that stream, which is known by
the name of Charles river." Here the committee themselves mark
the distinction between Charles river and the brook that runs iotG
it, calling each by its own proper name, by wvhich it had always
been known and still is. If all the tributary streams which find
their way into a river are to take its name, and to be considered
part of it before they reach it, and contribute their mites to its

waters, then would there be 'a mighty change in the great natural
boundariec by. rivers, between nations and states, and even eounties. If the Mississippi should be so measured, it would be a wonderful river to behold; and many a great state, and parts of states,
wou.o disappear from the map of the United States. But the Missouri is not the Mississippi, nor part of the Mississippi, until it joins
it; and if a state should be bounded on a line to be run twenty
miles distant from the Mississippi, nobody would dream of measuring the twenty miles from the Missburi as part of the Mississippi
When two rivers, or streams, come together and form one river,
which keeps the name of one of the branches, that name can never.
be understood to comprehend the other branch, having a distnct
name of its own. 'If, therefore, this Mill brook, instead of being
a mere streamlet creeping into Charles river, was really a principal
branch of Charles river, having its own proper name ; neither that
name nor the brook could ever be confounded with the river or its
name, until they were swallowed' up in the main river.
Here, your honours have the real and only question between
the parties, upon the merits of the cause under the charters. That
,question (as first raised by Massachusetts committee of 1,791,
and never before) is, whether the first charter granted to Massachusetts, by King Charles I., in 1629, by the name "Charles river,"
meant Charles river proper, as it was then and ever since has been
known and called; or, besides this, meant also Jack's Pasture, or
Mill brook, running from near a large chesnut tree into a pond
called Whiting's pond, two and a halft miles off from Charles
river, meant also the said'Whiting's pond: and, moreover, another
brook running out of the pond, and fin.ally getting into Charles
river. This, I repeat, is the only question upon the merits, as the
defendant himself has made it, If the defen~dant is willing to
have a trial upon the merits, let him put them in issue, or allcr
us to put them iii issue. Both' parties would then have an opportunity to produce their evidence applicable to that question. Among
other evidence, we have in our possession certified copies of a large
number of original grants, from 1659 to 1698, to individuals, of
lands, bounded, some on Charles river, and some on Mill brook, or
Jack's Pasture brook ; all of them showing, that the'river and
brook were never confounded together, but, were always distinguished by the same separate names they now are. We have also
much other material evidence upon that question of the merits. • But
your honours cannot now hear any of it, because that question is
not in issue, or on trial. The defendant virtually acknowledges the
original title of -Rhode Island, by setting up a supposed cession or
grant from her, in bar of that title. Let him, then, present that
bar matter and our reply to it, in such a manner that they can be
fairly tried. Let him not deprive us of a fair trial upon one question or the other, either upon the merits, or the bar, or both ; as he
had it in his power to do under the twenty-third rule of practice
established by the Court : allowing a defendant to have the benefit

SUPREME COUR.:
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

of his bar matter, under his answer to the merits, as fully as he can
by pleading it specially.
I will now proceed to consider the question of the sufficiency of
the defendant's plea as a bar.
This plea is in bar to the whole bill.
The requisites of such a.plea being familiar to the Court, we have
only to inquire whether the present plea possesses those requisites.
Our objections to it, I will endeavour to bring under one or other of
the following heads: 1. The matter of the plea does not constitute
a bar to the relief prayed for, 2. The plea does not contain the
statements of facts, and the averments necessary to a good plea in
bar. 3. The plea is not accompanied by such an answer as the
rules of equity require to support such a plea, and to give to the
plaintiff the benefit of the material facts charged in the bill in avoidance of the plea.
The plea c6mmences with relating that in the year 1642, a station
was erected and fixed at a point then taken and believed to be on
the true boundary liue between the two states. So mere a story as
this, would be thought too loose and light for the use of a common
annalist, whose work is Very unlike that of a special pleader. A,
station was taken, it is said; and we are left to conjecture that it
was erected by one Woodward and one Saffrey, by its being called
the Woodward and Saffrey station; who in another place are called
skilful and approved artists. But the Massachusetts historian, Dr.
Douglass, tells us, that they were two illiterate and obscure sailors,
and would never have been heard of but for the controversies between Massachusetts and Connecticut and-Rhode Island. There is
no- report or statement from Woodward and Saffrey themselves of
their doings, and no record of any. The plea says that the station
then set up was believed to be. on the true line. This mode of
expression would hardly have been used if any actual survey had
been made, and the real charter line ascertained by actual measurement. The plea avoids stating that Woodward and Saffrey were
employed by Massachusetts, or authorized by anybody. If they
acted under the orders of the Massachusetts government-which I
do not doubt, if they acted at all; which I do doubt, because I see
no reason for believing it-then, what wasdone was the ex parte
act of Massachusetts, and not binding upon anybody. It is not pretended that any notice was taken of Rhode Island in what was done.
Indeed, it was only about six years before that date, that Roger
Williams and his companions, having been exiled from Massachusetts for conscience' sake, took refuge in Providence. It is a matter
of history, that neither Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire,
Maine or Plymouth, were acknowledged by Massachusetts, at that
day, as possessing any power independent of herself. At that early
period, she assumed to be mistress over all the surrounding territories; and she drew her lines and erected her stations as she pleased,
without consulting her feeble neighbours, and in defiance of them.
And that she most wantonly encroached upon them all, is a mattel

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

233

[The Sate of Rhode Iiland vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

not only of history, but of judicial record. It seems to me that the
defendant can add no strength to his plea in bar by basing it upon
his own ex parte act, and insisting upon that act as the source and
foundation of all the subsequent proceedings which be sets up as
matters in bar to a claim founded upon his own charter as well as
upon the charter of a sister state.
The plea proceeds to state, that, by virtue of an act of the General Assembly of Rhode Island, passed the 30th of July, 1709, Major
Joseph Jenckes was appointed to meet Colonel Dudley, who was appointed by Massachusetts, and to settle the misunderstanding about
the line, &c.: "provided it be within six months after passing of the
act of the said Assembly ;" that "said Jenckes and Dudley, on the
19th day of January, then next ensuing, and within six months from
the passing of said act," did meet and conclude the following agreement, &c. Here is an error in the reckoning of time apparent on the
paper. The recited agreement is dated, "Roxbury, January 19th,
1710-11," which was eighteen months instead of six months, after
the passing of the act referred to. The mistake of defendant probably arose from not noticing the double dating practised -it that day,
and including both the oldand the new style. By the old style the
year commenced and ended on the 25th of March. So that the
same month of January, which was part of the year 1710, by the
old style, was the commencement of the year 1711, by the new.
But, take it either way, the month of July, 1709, was eighteen
months prior to the date of the instrument. This being the case, the
agreement of Jenckes and Dudley was null and void: Jenckes'
authority to act having expired a year before he did act.
The case would have been altered, had the two governments
afterwards confirmed the instrument. But no such thing was done
by either government, and is not alleged to have been. This inatrument, therefore, is no bar to the bill.
But, as every subsequent proceeding set up in the plea is therein
averred to hav6 been based upon this Roxbury agreement, and takeht
in pursuance of it; and as it is from and under and by virtue of this
agreement, that defendant claims to have held possession; I will, with
permission, make some remarks fipon it, for the purpose of showing
its character, and the manner in which it was obtained.
It is stated, that the committee met at Roxbury, and then and
there debated the challenges concerning the several charters; &c.
relating to the line between the two colonies. This reference to the
charters makes them part of the instrument as much as if they had
been annexed to it. Now, by the Massachusetts charter, her southern boundary line was to be three Eniglish miles south of the most
southerly part of Charles river. Thus, the plain duty of the committee was to go to Charles river, ascertain the most southerly .part
of it, measure off the three miles south, and thence run the line east
and west, or erect a monument from which the line might be run.
But the committee performed no part of this dutr, and took no single step by which the object of their appointment could be effected.
u2

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island v8. The State of Massachusetts.]

They took no view of Charles river, made no survey or measurement, nor any attempt to ascertain the charter line. On the contrary, Jenckes went to Roxbury, two miles out of Boston, and thirty or
forty miles from the place where hiq business called him; and there,
at the door of Governor Dudley, they debated the challenges, as they
call it. This is easily accounted for, and can be accounted for in
one way only. The two committees and, their respective colonies
were very differently situated. It was plainly for the interest of
Rhode Island, to have the true charter line ascertained and established, and not to be tied down to the ex parte doings of Massachuisetts.
But Massachusetts had already carved for herself, and was desirous
only of keeping what she had taken; and it was,-therefore, the purpose of Dudley, her commissioner and governor, to draw Jenckes
away from Charles river, and to avoid having any inspection or actual survey taken, by which, at the same time that the true charter
line was ascertained, it would be made to appear that Massachusetts had encroached largely upon Rhode Island. And Dudley
gained his point, and brought Jenckes to join with him in saing and
agreeing that "the stake set up by Nathaniel Woodward' and Solomon Saffrey, skilful and approved artists, in 1642, and since often
renewed, &c., being three English miles distant from Charles river,
agreeably to the letters patent for the Massachusetts province, &c.,
should be the commencement of the line, &c." Can it be doubted
*ho dictated this instrument, and who drew it. These representations of the doings of Massachusetts agents were palpably made by
Dudley, the then Massachusetts agent, to, Jenckes. Jenckes did not
know that there ever were such men as Nathaniel Woodward or
Solomon Saffrey; or that they were skilful and approved artists; or
that they ever set up any stake anywhere; or that it had been often
or ever renewed. He did noteven know that any such stake then
existed, much less that it was three English miles, and no more, from
Charles river. Yet, all this Dudley induced him to subscribe to. If
it was allowable here, we could show that the very same language
used in this report about Woodward and Saffrey, and theirskill, and
their station, &c. &c;, was Dudley's language, used in a communication from him made four years before. And the very truth is,
that Jenckes' appointment was procured by Dudley himself, as appears by the vote itself, passed by the General Assembly in July,
and referred to at the commencement of this plea, as giving Jenckes
authorityto act. Which vote recites, that, "whereas, the Assembly
has been credibly inforned that his excellency Colonel Dudley has
declared, that if Major Joseph Jenckes was empowered thereto, he
doubted not but that they two should settle," &c. &c. The General
Assembly did not foresee the use that Colonel Dudley was to make
of his Jajor Jenckes.
I do not forget that we are now trying the suffic, ency, and not the
truth of defendant's plea. but the averments in the plea cannot
cover or protect such marks Or evidences of mistake, misconduct;
undue influence, &c.&c., as appear upon the face of the instrument

JANUARY TERM, i840.

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.1

itself, pleaded in bar; for these go to show the invalidity of the bar.
There are other such marks on this instrument. The line, it says,
is to be run " as is deciphered in a plan or tract by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey, now shown to us, and is now remaining
on record in the Massachusetts government." It is a trifling circumstance to remark upon; but it is now acknowledged, that the
plan or tract spoken of was never on record in Massachusetts, otherwise than as it was deposited in the secretary's office ; and, if Dudley then hrad it at Roxbury, it was not then remaining on record.
But what had Jenckes to do with this ex parte plan, any more than
with the ex parte station of Woodward and Saffrey; of neither of
which had he any knowledge beyond the mere assertion of the adverse party. And let me ask, why was not that plan or tract, or, a
copy of it, annexed to the instrument of which it was made a
part, and which, without it, was a nullity, and could not be carried
into effect, any more than a bill of sale of certain articles enumerated
in an inventory not annexed or identified ? And where is that pretended plan n'ox, that it is not produced here ? The counsel says;'
that it is on record, or on file ; and will be produced on proper occasion. And is not this the proper occasion, when the validity of the
insfrumoqt3 of which the plan is made part, is on trial; and that instrument cannot be understood without the plan it refers to and
rests upon ? The counsel have procured and produced a recent plat
to show the importance of Mill brooke. Can it be believed that the
pretended Woodward and Saffrey plan would not be produced, if
any thing favourable was to be found in it? I have no doubt that
there was, at some time or other, and now is, a scrawl of 'ome kind,
which has been called the Woodward and Saffrey plan or tract.
But I am confident, that, whenever it makes its appearance, it Will
be seen that the person or persons who made it, whether Woodward
and Saffrey, or somebody else long afterwards, were grossly ignorant; afid no glimpse of light can be obtained from it to aid in ascertaining the line between the parties.
Lastly, the committee agree that persons should be appointed by
the governor and counsel of each state, to show the ancient line,
&c. Here we see Governor Dudley again. Massachusetts had,
and still has, a distinct. political body so entitled, and with the power
of appointment; but there was no such body in Rhode Islnd.
Jenckes knew this, and yet he repeated after Dudley whatever was
dictated to him. But no such committee was ever appointed by
either government; and is not alleged to have been.
Next, the plea recites parts of votes passed by the two legislatures, in 1717 and 1718, appointing another committee to settle the
line, and then sets out the agreement made by those committees at
Rehoboth, October 22d, 1.718. And the plea avers that those committees were appointed, and the agreement made "in pursuance of"
the Roxbury agreement of 1710, 1711, which I have just been ex.
amining.
It appears that both legislatures, by their first votes, did restrict

23.6

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs.The State of Massachusetts.]

their respective committees to the Roxbury agreement. But the
Rhode Island legislature, by its. subsequent Vote, passed June 17th,
1718, expressly disowned the Roxbury doings, and gave its committee unrestricted power to settle the line, as near as might be, according to the charter; and the Massachusetts legislature) by its
second vote, gave the same power to her committee. And thus the
Roxbury agreement, which was void in itself from the beginning,
was abandoned by both parties.
The Rehoboth agreement, (as it is called, from the place where it
was made,) is in eight and a half lines, with a preamble: and the
whole of it is, that the line should be run from the Woodward and
Safirey stake, so as to be at Connecticut river two and a half miles
south of a due west line. This agreement is liable to some of the same
material objections that have been made to the Roxbury agreement.
The committee paid no regard to the charters, nor made any attempt
to ascertain the true charter line. They arbitrarily adopted the pretended Woodward and Saffrey stake, wherever it might be; without
knowing that there was any such stake, or going to see either that
or Charles river. The plea then alleges, that the General Assembly
of Rhode Island accepted this Rehoboth agreement, and ordered
it to be recorded; and thereby ratified and confirmed it. I will consider, presently, what kind of ratification this was.
The plea now introduces the last instrument tipon which it relies,
and which has been called the report of the running committee.
That committee consist.d of four persons, who say, in their report,
that they were appointed by the Rehohoth committee to run the
This is the only evidence there is
line by them agreed upon.
oftheir appointment by anybody. The Rehoboth Ieport speaks
of no sluch committee ; and none such was appointed by either colony: Whatever, their authority was, they undertook to run a line,
and say in their report of it, that "having met at the stake of NaThis was
thaniel Woodward and 'Solomon Saffrey," &c. &c.
spealking loosely. The stake set up by Woodward and Saffrey, in
1642, (if ever set up,) certainly was not in existence in 1719' Their
meaning probably was, that the stake they met at was where the
Woodward and Saffrey stake had been. Pat how did they know
this; and what authority had they for saying it ? No doubt there
was a stake where thekr met, for they would not have been carried
there without a stake for them to start from. But who set up that
stake, and where was it set up ? Neither' the Roxbury committee
of 1710,1711, nor the Rehoboth committee of 1718, set up any stake
or monument. They only speak of a stake said to have been set
-up by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey, in 1642, and
since often renewed, in latitud6 410 55', (says the ;st committee,)
but they saw no such stake, nor knew that any su.h existed. Thu
this running committee had nothing to go by. Tiiey had, not the
plan or tract of Woodward and Saffrey, nor did their take the latitude
410 55', on whicn the Roxbury report said the Woodward and Saffrey stake was set up; for that latitude would, in fact, have carried

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

237

[The State of'Rhode Islanid vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

them many -miles off from the stake where they met; which, as
appears from the line described by the committee,) was in latitude
420 3'. By their'own showing, the running committee had no
power to fix any station, or set up any. stake themselves. How,
then, did they know that the stake they saw was where the Woodward and Saffrey stake had been? They could only believe from
what was told them ; and that, in all probability, by persons interested, and who had themselves set up the stake they wished the
line to be run from. It was the tradition in that quarter for many
years, and derived from the old men of the day, that the pretended
stake was a bean pole, stuck up by John Chandler, one of the running committee.e At all events, that committee had no right to hear
evidence, for they had no power to decide.
Thus, from all that appears, there is as good cause for believing
that the stake from which these four men started, was any where
else, as that it was at or near the place of the Woodward and Saffrey
stake, if there evqr was any.
For myself, I can see nothing in all those proceedings, from beginni!g to end, but kmposition, and the exercise of undue influence
over the Rhode Islnd committees.
The plea then alleges, that the said report or return of the running
committee " was approved by the General Assembly of the said
colony pf Rhode Island," &c. This is copied from our original bill;
but in the amended bill, (page 36,) those words are stricken out,
being incorrect, and the words, " the above return is accepted
by the Assembly: a true copy, extracted from the public records of
the colony of Rhode Island, examined by T. Ward, secretary,"
inserted. That being the minute appearing on the document itself.
I have no desire to be critical, but it may be observed, that there is
no vote of acceptance. A secretary or clerk can only certify to a
copy of a vote. He has no authority to certify that :such or such
a thing was done, or-vote passed. The record is the only evidence
of votes; and certified copies are the evidences of the record.
But what does it amount to, if there were such a vote ? It was
no more than the ordinary form on such occasions. Wheit a legislative committee makes a report, something is to be done with it ;
and the usual course is to receive or accept it; and then it is laid on
the table, or ordered on file, or taken up and acted upon. The ame
course was pursued in the. legislature of Massachusetts, as appears
by the secretary's minutes, on some of the reports of their committees. But the report so received or accepted is nothing of itself,
until some legislative act is passed upon the subject of it.
But the legislature of Rhode Island never passed any act-confi rning the doings of either of those committees, or establishing
either of the lines (for they all differ) spoken of by them. Nor did
the legislature of Massachusetts ever pass any such act; and it is
not alleged that she did. .And, if one of the governments had confirmed those proceedings,. by ever so solemn an act of ratification,

238

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts,]

the other could take no advantage of it without passing a similar
and mutual act of dinfirmation on her part.
But as there was no such ratificatloh by either government, it
seems that the defendant would now set up the doings of the committees, as binding and absolute in themselves, withbut any legislative acts confirming them: thus making the committees independent
of, and paramount to, the legislatures which created them. This is
novel, and I should think, dangerous doctrine. If this is true, the
moment the legislature passed a vote appointing a committee to perform a certain service, it parted with all power over the subject;
and could neither revoke the appointment, nor vary, nor in any way
touch the powers of that committee. This was not the understhnding of either legislature at the time of passing the votes and appointing their committees, as has already been shown. The boundary
line between Massachusetts and Connecticut (which by their charters was precisely the same as ours) was agreed upon by a joint committee, in 1713 ; and the doings of that committee were ratified and
confirmed by mutual acts passed by both legislatures: and it was
those legislative acts of confirmation, and not the report of the committee, upon which Massachusetts wholly relied in their subsequent
dispute respecting the line. And even those solemn acts of ratification were set aside for the same causes and grounds which we are
now presenting to the Court. This, as I before remarked, is new
ground, even for Massachusetts to take. For her own committee
of 1791, (whose report, jointly with the Rhode Island committee, is
copied into our bill; and whose separate report to their own legislature is annexed to the bill, and h'as already been referred to,) that
committee, remarking that the proceedings of the former committees
had not been confirmed by either government, joined with the
Rhode Island committee in recommending to their respective governments, "to subnit the matter in dispute to indifferent men of
the neighbouring states; or to unite in an application to Congress to
settle the same, agreeably to the respective charters, and the Constitution of the United States."
I have thus far endeavoured to show from the plea itself that the
matter contained in it does not constitute a bar to the plaintiff's bill;
and will now, with permission, proceed to the two other general
grounds of objection, which, as they are closely connected, I will
consider together. They are, 1st, That the plea does not contain
the statements. of facts, nor the averments necessary to a good plea
in bar; and 2d, That it is not accompanied by such an answer as
the rules of equity require to. support such a plea, and to give the
plaintiff the benefit of the matter charged in the bill in avoidance of
the plea. I wish it to be understood that we make no objections to
the mere form either of the plea or answer. Our objections are to
the merits, and substance of them., And we contend, that not a
single material fact charged in the bill in avoidance of the bar matter pleaded, is negatived or met by any averment in the plea, or by

JANUARY TERM, 1840

239

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachisetts.]

the answer. -So that, as the plea and answer now stand, the defendant would avail himself of his legal defence, while he Would exclude
the plaintiff from all the equitable facts and circumstances charged
in the bill in avoidance of the bar; which, by the rules of equity, a
defendant is not permitted to do.
In avoidance of the two agreements plead in bar, viz. that made
at Roxbury in 1710, 1711, and that at Rehoboth in 1718, the bill
charges that the Rlbode Island committees who signed those instruments were misled by representations made to them by the Massachusetts committees, and acted under the mistaken belief that the
pretended Woodward and Saffrey station was really on the true
charter line, and was no more than three English miles from the
most southerly part of Charles river; and that under this erroneous
belief they signed the agreements; which, if confirmed, would transfer to Massachusetts a large portion of territory justly belonging to
Rhode Island, and the jurisdiction over it. This is the general
charge; and in support and proof of it,,the bill charges the following facts, viz. that by actual survey and measurement, it is proved
that the line alleged to have been run according to those agreements
is near eight miles, instead of three miles, distant from the most
southerly part of Charles river, and takes from Rhode Island a tract
of territory four, miles and fifty-six rods wide on the east, and over
five miles 6n the west end; and in length, twenty-three miles: that
said line does not conform to the line designated in either of said
agreements, it being in latitude 42' 3' N., whereas the supposed
Woodward and Saffrey station is alleged to have been in latitude
410 55': that neither of said committees made any survey or measurement, nor any attempt to ascertain the true charter line : that,
at the dates of said agreements, there was no such station as the
pretended Woodward and Saffrey station, nor any evidence that
there ever had been any: that said committees saw no such station,
and took no step to ascertain whether there then was or ever
had
been any, or how far it was from Charles river, if it did exist.
It was the duty of the plea to have met and negatived the main
charge by direct and positive averments; but there is no such averment to be found in the plea. The principal averinent is, that there
was no covin, fraud, or misrepresentation. The bill does not charge
covin or fraud, although it might justly have done so. The averment of no misrepresentation, is evasive, and no direct negative; for
the defendant might admit'that such representations were made as
the bill charges, and yet might consistently aver that no misrepresentations were made,'for he might say they'were true. But it is
of little importance from what source the committees received their
impressions; it is enough that the hill charges that they act-ad under
an erroneous belief; and this charge is not touched by. any of the
averments. The other averments are, that the whole merits of the
plaintifi's claim were 'heard and decided upon by the committees:
that the agreements were fair, legal, and binding, and madewith a
full and equal knowledge of all circumstances by both parties. All

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

the first part of this is mere opinion and assertion. A man charged
with a breach of contract, might as well reply that he was an honest
man, and a man of fair standing. The sweeping allegation that the
agreements were made with a full and equal knowledge of all circumstances, has none of the qualities of an averment required in
pleading. It is no traverse of anr specific charge or fact. No fact
charged, however important, could be put in issue under it. Yet
that is the whole object of averments in the plea; which are therefore required to be direct and positive, not evasive,.or by way of
opinion, inference, or implication, which it is the province of the
Court to deal with, not the party..
The bill also charges that the legislature of Rhode Island was
deceived, and led to believe that its committees had ascertained the
true charter line: that there really was such a station as the Woodward and Saffrey station, and that it was on the true line, and no
more than thre6 miles from Charles river. This charge is most important, because the legislature, if it had not itself been deceived,
could have corrected the errors of its committees. Now there is not
a word in the plea or answer that in any way meets, much less
negatives, this main charge; which goes to the roots of the pretended
agreements. And the defendant might as well have put no averments at all into his plea, and accompanied it with no answer; and
still have insisted upon having the pretended agreements sanctioned
and allowed to be'valid, without any examination whatever. Will
equity countenance any such practice ? It is observable that the
Roxbury agreement is so framed, and contains such statementl, as
could not fail to mislead and deceive the General Assembly of
Rhode Island.

The committee professed to go by the charters and

letters patent of the two colonies; as the legislature of Rhode Island
expected they would, and supposed they had done. The -committee then adopt the supposed Woodward and Saffrey.take, " being
(they say) three Enclish miles distant from the southernmost part
of Charles river, agreeably to the letters patent for' the Massachusetts province." It cannot be averred here that Governor Dudley
had no hand in making this representation. And how was it possible for the legislature of Rhode Island to avoid being deceived by
this representation ?
So much for the averments in the plea. And now for the accompanying answer-if that can be cailed an answer, which is a mere
repetition of the averments in the plea, without the slightest addition
to them. Can such an answer be said to support the plea, as the
rule in equity requires that it should ? But, to support the plea is
not the only office of the answer. It must meet anl respond, particularly and specifically, toevery fact and equitable circumstance
charged in the bill, in proof of the main charge in avoidance of the
bar matter pleaded; to the end that the plaintiff may have the benefit, and avail himself of his equitable defence against the bar. If
the answer cannot do this with truth or safety, then the plea is not
only a defective and insufficient one, but is an improper plea to be

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

241

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

used. May I not correctly say that this plea is not supported by
such an answer as the rules of equity require; and without which
the plea cannot be sustained?
Again,.the bill charges, that the agreements now set up were
never consented to by the king of England; without which, at that
day, the colonies had no power to make any compact affecting their
territories or jurisdiction. This being the case; it was- necessary
for the plea to show the authority of the two colonies to act, as it
was to show the authority by which their committees acted. This
same objection was made by the state of'Connecticut, in her controversy with Massachusetts about their boundary line; and made
too against the validity of the solemn acts of the two legislatures.
And how was it met by- Massachusetts? Her reply was, that her
government, by its charter, was required to send all its public acts
to the king, for his approbation; and' that such of them as were not
disallowed within a certain period were to be considered as allowed.
It was, therefore, inferred by Massachusetts, that this course must
have been taken upon the occasion of her compact with Connecticut; and that that compact had been tacitly consented to by the
king. In the case of Pool vs. Fleeger, recently decided in this Court,
there was a formal compact between the states of Kentucky and
Tennessee, settling a boundary line between them; which compact
was formally ratified by both governments, and consvnted to by Congress. The Court said in that case: "It is part of the general right
of sovereignty belonging to independent nations to establish and fix
disputed boundaries. This right is recognised by the Constitution
of the United States, with the limitation or restriction requiring the
consent of Congress." As, therefore, the consent of Congress is
pecessary to the validity of satch a compact, even at the present
day, it follows, that a party who pleads such a compact in bar to a
suit, must show its validity, by stating the consent of Congress to it.
But in the present case, the bill itself charges the defect in the Rox:bury and Rehoboth agreements; and the charge ought to have been
directly met and responded toby the plea and answer. It is for the
purpose of showing the insufficiency of the plea, in this respect,
that I mention the charge contained in the bill; and not fur the purpose of discussing here the objection itself to the two agreements
which would not now be proper. But the plaintiff has a right to
be heard upon that question at a proper time, and therefore, the
defendant was bound t6 respond~to the charge.
The plea concludes by stating, in substance, that the defendant
doth plead the said agreement of 1710, 1711, and the said agreement of 1718. "And unmolested possession according to the same,
from the date of the said agreements, in bar to the whole bill," &c.
The opening counsel for the defendant-has considered the alleged
possession as constituting a distinct bar of itself. If this is the
meaning of the plea, it is pleading double; which is a fatal objection to any such l)lea. The passages, therefore, read by the counsel
from Vattel, to show that prescription may give a good title, are
VOL. XIV.-X.

[The State of Rhode sland vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

out of place; supposing that the counsel did not mean to spoil his
own plea. To' be sure he ought to understand his own plea best;
.but I suppose that long possession under the two agreements, is
alleged in the plea for the purpose of aiding and protecting them
from inquiry into defects in their origin. Long possession is frequently used for this purpose. But this plea alleges long possession only. It alleges. no .acquiescence in or assent to that possession, without which mere naked possession is of no avail; for it
furnishes no inference of the fairness of the original transaction,
sought to be sustained. This may be illustrated by a very common
cage. A man obtains a conveyanqe of an estate, by imposition or ,
some unjustifiable means, which, in equity, vitiates and annuls the
transaction. Arid, having got possession, he retains it for many
years. But, in the mean time, the injured party, having discovered
the imposition Or mistake, and the injury done him, demands restitution from the wrongdoer, who holds many conferences with him;
but evades the claim and avoids any inquiry into the justice of it,
continues to hold possession. It is plain, th'at in such a case, the
continued possession of the wrongdoer, instead of bettering the
original transaction, aggravates its injustice. It is laid down by
Vattel, page -192, that even prescription or usucaption, cannot be
set up against a party who is not in a condition to enforce his rights.
This is-precisely the plaintiff's case. And this case is clearly and
fully made out by our bill. 'And if the defendant had given us a
sufficient plea and answer, so that'we might have taken issue, the
question of her alleged possession might have been tried, and we
should have had an opportunity to rebut and avoid the alleged possession, by producing the facts stated in the bill, and other. evidence,
proving that the defendant has had no such possession as can give
any ad or countenance to the two agreements which she relies
upon, and which we impeach. But no such trial upon the question
of possession can be had under the present question as to the sufficiency of the plea; and'I can only refer to the facts charged in the
bill, for the purpose of showing the insufficiency of the plea in not
having met and responded to those facts, so that they might have
been put in issue and tried. The bill, after pointing out the irnposition or erroneous belief under which the Roxbury and ] ehoboth agreeIments had been signed by thecommittees; states that the error or mistake thus committed, and the wiong thereby done to Rhode Island,
were not discovered until an actual survey of the premises was
made in 1749, 1750, by which the true charter line was ascertained.
That from that time Rhode Island never ceased to assert her claim,
or to deny the right of Massachusetts to the possession of the territory of which she had wrongfully got possession. That the
Rhode Island legislature had, time after time, appointed, and con
tinued, committees,' for the purpose of effecting a settlement of the
dispute with Massachusetts, and had constantly urged that. colony,
and afterwards state, to appoint committees on her part for the same
purpose; which had, been done by Massachusetts, and many con-

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

ferences upon the subject of the existing misunderstanding had
been! held by those, committees from the year 1750, and continued
to be held up to a recent date. But without producing any good
effect: except in the year 1791, when the committees from the two
states, not being able to agree upon the main subject, did agree to
,recommend to their respective governments to refer the matter in
dispute to indifferent men of other states, or to Congress, to settle
the same agreeably to the respective charters; the Massachusetts
coinrhittee being satisfied that nothing' binding on either party had
as yet been done. That some time after the committees appointed,
'by, the two colonies in 1749, 1750, had failed to effect a settlement,
Rhode Island prepared 'to prosecute her claim before the king in
council. "But that, being then thinly populated, and her resources
-very limited, and the war with France having soon after broken out,
by which her attention was directed to other objects, and her resources exhausted; her endeavours to obtain a settlement of'the
line, according to her charter, were ineffectual; and that her efforts
tO effect that object were again suspended by the war of the revo:
lution. But that towards the' end of that war, in 1782, upon the
petition of a large number of the inhabitants residing on the disputed territory, claiming of right to beldng to Rhode Island; the
legislature again appointed a committee who reported in favour of
said claim."'
Besides these, there are other material facts and circumstances to
the sane effect, which, whenever the question of the alleged possession by Massachusetts shall be tried, will conclusively prove,
that from the year 1748, 1749, when the error in the boundary line
was first discovered, Rhode Island has never, for a moment, acquiesced in the justice of that possession, but has constantly denied
it, and demanded restitution; and that the character of that possession has r- been such as to give any consistency or validity to the.
pretended agreements of 1710, 1711, and 1718, or either of them.
But, as that question of possession is not now on trial; I presume
that the references I have made to the charges in the bill, upon this
head, are enough to support 'our objection to the plea'and answer
for insufficiency, in not having in any way negatived, met, or responded to a single one of those charges. I may, how-ever, be
allowed to remark, that, undoubtedly, Rhode Island was always
very rehictant to engage in a conflict with her powerful neighbour.
And it is apparent, that the part whiclh Massachusetts herself acted,
from the time that the error was discovered in 1749, was the chief
cause thaf Rhode Island did not sooner adopt stronger measures for
enforcing her right. For, the'"committees which Massachusetts continued tQ appoint and keep up, although they parried the claim of
Rhode Island, yet, by temporizing with her committees, and leading
them along from period to period, they encouraged the expectation
that an equitable settlement might finally be effected.' And certainly Rhode Island had a right to indulge in this expectation', Pnrticularly after the year 1791, when the Massachusetts committee

244

JANUARY' TERM, 1840.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massathusetts.]

itself recommended the appointment of impartial referees to settle
the line according to the charters; which they were satisfied had
nbt been done,' but ought to be done.
It ought to be recollected also, that, during all that period, the
same controversy existed, and was carried on between Massachusetts and Connecticut The two :complainant states co-operated
together, particularly in the measures taken to. bring their complaints before the king in council. Connecticut w"s the larger and
-more influential colony; and Rhode Island very properly expected,
her to tdke the lead in the common cause, relying upon her efforts
to'biing Massachusetts to justice. But during all that period there
was never any acquiescence by Rhode Island any 'more than by
Connecticut, in the wrongful possession of Massachusetts; both colonies, or states, equally and constantly protested against that wrongful possession, and demanded restitution. It was not until the year
1804, that Connecticut brought Massachusetts to terms: and certainly, when that was done, Rhode Island had good reason to hope
that her claims (resting upon the same basis as those of Connecticut,)
would also be listened to, and her rights respected by Massachusetts. And accordingly, committees' were soon afterwards appointed by the two states to' make a settlement between them.
And those committees continued their conferences until no long
time before the commencement of this suit. Clearly, Massachusetts had as good a pretence for setting up her long possession
against Connecticut, as she can now have for setting 'it up against

Rhode Island: and better; for the agreement made in 1713, by their
committees, adopting the same pretended Woodward and Saffrey
station, as did the Roxbury committees in our case; that agreement
was' confirmed and ratified by solemn acts of both governments.
But Connecticut would not consent, that a posses ion, wrongful in
its commencement and continuance, and always protested against,
should be used to support an agreement obtained by unfair means,
and under which that possession had been unjustly held. And
Massachusetts acquiesced in the objection, and abandoned the pretence of possession. Can she now revive the same pretence against
the other copartner state; with whom she had, at the same time,
precisely the same controversy.
The counsel has dwelt and laboured upon this allegation of possession, as if the mere fact of possession was the only thing he had
to establish. And has read a part of our bill to show that that fact
is admitted by the plaintiff; and this,.he thinks, settles the whole
matter: keeping out of sight the facts charged by way of replication, in the bill, (in conformity to the practice in equity,) in avoidance of the admitted possession, showing that the alleged possession. was unfairly obtained, had been unjustly continued, and always
protested against. This is the incurable defect oft the plea itself.
It tenders no issue upon the only facts upon which an issue can be
taken. The fact of possession being admitted by the replication,
makes no part of the issue to be joined. The facts charged in avoid-

ance of that possession, are the only facts to be put in issue, so far
as posgession makes part of the bar matter pleaded. As well might
a defendant who pleads a release in bar, to which the plaintiff replies, admitting the execution of the release, but charging that it
had been obtained by fraud; as well might the defendant refuse to
have any trial upon the charge of fraud, and still insist upon his
naked release, because the execution ot it is admitted
It has been asserted that Rhode Island was never, for a single
moment, in possession of the territory in question. This is saying
too much. Wheh the Rhode Islanders were driven from Massachusetts because they were Baptists and Quakers, they 'purchased
of the native proprietors, and honestly paid for that part of the
Narraganset's country which was b~yond the jurisdiction of the
hostile colony; and there they colonized and took possession of the
country in 1635, 1636. In 1643, they obtained their first charter,
and their last in 1663; confirming their purchase from the native
proprietors, and erecting them into a colony, bounded north on the
charter line of Massachusetts colony. If certain persons (whatever their names) did go into the wilderness in 1642, and did,
somewhere or other, set up a stake, and leave it standing, that act
did not interfere with the rights of anybody. If the Massachusetts colony had any agency in that, (which no how'appears, nor is
alleged in the plea,) she certainly did not pretend to take any possession adversely to the king or the king's grant to Rhode Island.
Rhode Island, therefore, was dlearly ini possession, at least down to
1710, 1711, the date of the agreement between Dudley and Jenckes;
as to the possession which Massachusetts then obtained, how she
obtained and how retained it, I have already sufficiently commented
upon; more than sufficiently, for the purposes of this argument
upon the sufficiency of the defendant's plea.
Sundry passages have been read from Vattel, to show the sacred
character of treaties and compacts between sovereigns. Who ever
doubted so self-evident a proposition ? But what are those treaties
and compacts which are so obligatory ? They are such as are just
and unimpeachable; executed fairly and freely ; without suggestiq
falsi, or suppressio veri; free from the charge of imposition, or
undue practice, or unjust advantage. Is there any thing to be
found in Vattel, that enjoins the observance of a compact of a different character from this; much more the confirmation of such a
compact when made by agents acting under a gross mistake of
facts? I am unable to comprehend the doctrine which would apply
different rules and principles of justice to the conduct of sovereigns,
and to that of individuals. Justice herself knows no such distinc
tion.
The counsel has intimated, that the habits and feelings of the inhabitants of that district, would revolt at being included within the
limits of Rhode Island. He speaks without authority, and is
wholly mistaken. Some years ago a large and respectable portion
of those inhabitants, in a memorial to the legislature of Rhode

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.j

Island, claimed to belong, to that state; and solicited the legislature
to enforce their right. I am fully warranted in saying, that the mass
of those inhabitants still entertain the same'opinions and wishes.
Mr. Webster, for the State of Massachusetts.
The colonial grant of James the First of England, of the Plymouth colony, was on the 3d of November, 1621. The grant was
for all the lands lying between the fortieth and forty-eighth degrees
of north latitude, extending westwardly from the bcean. On the
19th of March, 1628, the council of Plymouth made a grant to the
Massachusetts settlers, of the territory destined to form the colony
of Massachusetts, This grant was of, all the lands lying between.
the Merrimac river on the north, and three miles south of Charles
river, from the Atlantic or Western Ocean, on the east part, to the
South Sea, on the west part. This grant was confirmed by Charles
the First.
The description of the territory is first found in the grant of the
council of Plymouth to Massachusetts. Charles river was so called
after 1625, and before 1628. At that time, there was not a white
man in Massachusetts. It is a very important fact, and lies at the
foundation of the question, in this case, that at the period referredto, the boundary three miles south of Charles river, was fixed when
that river had never been ascended by the Wolonists three miles from
its mouth. The first settlement made by the colonists was in Salem.
It was made by Governor Endicott. Boston was not settled until
1630; and until that year Charles river was never ascended.
The facts stated in the plea, and which are admitted, by the complainants, are, that in 1642, Woodward and Saffrey's monument
was set up, to establish a south line for Massachusetts. This is
clearly and distinctly stated in the early- part of the plea.
This brings us to the fact, that fifteen years after the settlement
of Massachusetts, the monument was established, and was known,
and notorious. This was the position established for the boundary
line of the colony ; and it is important to ask, if, by this line, Mas.
sachusetts encroached on territory, not a part of her territory, on
whose territory did she encroach ? Not on that of Rhode Island;
for the colony of Rhode Island did not then exist. She must have
encroached on the territory of the crown of England. This state
of things remained until 1663, when the colony of Rhode Island
was established.
Charles the Second did not grant the territory which composed
the colony of Rhode Island by metes and bonds; other than declaring
the north line of the colony to be "on the north, or northerly by the
south or southerly line of Massachusetts plantations."
The colonies established by those grants did not hold under the
King of England. The language of the grants, i express terms,
excluded this. They were grants in "free and common socage."
When Rhode Island received her territory by the grant, she received
it bounded by the southwardly line of Massachusetts. This was an

acknowledgment of the boundary.

Now, after the elapse of one

hundred and ninety-eight years of full and uninterrupted possession
by Massachusetts; as a colony until 1776, and'as a state up to the
present period; she seeks to drive Massachusetts back from this line;
and to take from her sovereignty and dominion over three miles
of territory.
Why is this effort made? Why is this disturbance of the quiet
and unmolested possession by citizens of Massachusetts, claimed.?
Not because Rhode Island has a boundary different from that by which
she has hitherto been restrained. She had no rights, when the colony was established, other than to the line now existing between!
the two states. All she has of boundary or of territory, are, by the
express terms of her grant, secondary to those of Massachusetts.
She goes up to the southerly line'of Massachusetts; and there she
must stop, now, as heretofore.
The case presented to the Court, on the bill and answer, is that
of a second grantee, taking his boundary from a prior grant; and
who, after the elapse of one hundred and ninety-eight years, seeks
to disturb the line so long existing and recognised between the prior
grantee and himself.
On what ground is this attempt made? It is said, the boundary
was fixed by mistake. But the state of Massachusetts does not acknowledge any mistake; unless it is found in the fact, that her true
southern boundary, if it had bee.n correctly run, would be yet more
south than that fixed by the Woodward and Saffrey station. Going
higher up Charles river, a point far south of that stakion could have
been found; which would have fully answered the boundary described in the colonial grant, of a line three miles south of Charles
river.
How is it sought to maintain the position that the Woodward
and Saifrey station is more than three miles south of Chairles river ?
It is said that "Mill brook" and " Whiting's pond" are not parts of
Charles river.
It is important to bear in mind, as has been stated, that when the
station was fixed, but little of Charles river was known. The object
of the grant was to give to the colonists the benefit of all the waters
of Charles river; and the station was fixed in this view of the subject. "Mill brook" and " Whiting's pond" formed branches of the
river, as was then understood, and has ever since been so considered.
The question now before the Court is identical with that which now
disturbs the harmony of the United States and England; as to the
northern boundary of the state of Maine.
The question before the Court is brought under the provisions of
the Constitution of the United States. By what code of laws is it
to be decided ?
There were no provisions in the articles of confederation, nor are
there any in the Constitution of the United States, prescribing the
modes or rules of proceeding in such a case; nor are there any laws
of the land, or rules of Court to regulate Such a procedure, except

248

[The State of Rhode Tslandvs. The State of Massachusetts.]

as to the notice of the institution of the suit. In the history of thI
world, there is no account of a similar proceeding in any Court of
judicature. No adjudication of such a controversy is known in any
Court of the world. If any determination of the case is to be made,
it must be under the law of nations;
Will this Court consider the case as one between individuals; a
question of contract; and to be considered by the Court with a view
to enforce the contract, as if it were between two citizens or 'two
individualsrparties to the controversy ? No state in the Union would
submit to such a view of the case. Its rights, as a sovereign state,
are deeply involved in this question. The rights of the citizens to
the government under which they were born; to the laws which
they have assisted to make; and under which they have always
lived, and desire still to live; under which they have acquired and
hold their property ; are to be submitted to the Court.
The bill filed by the state of Rhode Island calls on the Court to
change the allegiance of a large number of the citizens of Massachusetts; to oblige them to submit to a different body of laws than
those which, by their own choice, have heretofore governed them:
to dismember a state: and this on the ground that, nearly two hundred years ago a mistake was made in fixing the boundary line
between -the two contending sovereignties. A possession of one
hundred and ninety-eight years is thus to be disregarded; and all
the rights of citizenship, all the rigs of property, all the affections
of the people to the state of their birth, education, and prosperity,
are to be set aside.
No complaint is made that the controversy between the parties to
this case is presented-by a bill in equity. It was proper to do so;
but this does not change the rules by which the case is to be decided.
A Court of Equity restores the consideration which has been paid
by a party to a contract, when it rescinds the contract. Will this
Court break up the compromise which was made by Massachusetts
with Rhode Island; and return to Massachusetts the one mile of her
territory which was given by her to Rhode -Island when the compromise was made?
This case must-be ,discussed and settled upon principles which
will have the sanction of the whole civilized community. What
can be more extraordinary and unusualy than an attempt, after the
elapse of one hundred and ninety-eight years, to open a question on
the ground of a mistake by the parties who had at that lQng by-gone
day adjusted the controversy, in which adjustment, the mistake is
alleged to have been made. Lewis the Fourteenth broke a treaty
solemnly'made, on the ground of a mistake in the negotiators of the
treaty; and all Europe was involved in war. The remarks of Voltaire on this act of the King of France, will apply to the attempt
made in the case before this Court, by the state of Rhode Island.
The state of Massachusetts has a right to call upon the complainants for a case, in whicha natural and ascertained botundary, known
and acted upon for so long a period, has been disturbed.. Look at

JANUARY, TERM, 1840.

249

[The State'of Rhode lsland'vs. The State of 'Massachusetts.]

the question presented for the consideration of the Court by the
agreements between the commissioners of the two colonies, while
they were colonies; and which had the acquiescence of the legislatures of both the parties. These are all stated in the plea. It is
alleged by Massachusetts that there is a boundary between her and
Rhode Island, of one hundred and ninety-eight years' standing; that
this boundary was established by competent persons in 1710, and
again. in 17,17 ; and from 1710,to the present time, Massachusetts,
as a colony and as a sovereign state, has held the territory now
claimed from her. Can a better reason against the removal or
change of a boundary be given by any state ?
Is not this a good diplomatic answer to the claim of the state of
Rhode Island ? One sovereign and independent state asks territory
from another state, of,equal rank with herself. -She is met by the
fact that the territory asked has been in possession of the state from
which she asks its surrender, for nearlktwo hundred years. This
should settle the question between the states. Established boundaries for one hundred years would not be disturbed between nations,
with the consent of other nations.
What was the mistake asserted to have been made by the commissioners of Rhode Island? It is said they weremisinformed as
to the distance of Woodward and Saffrey's station from Charles
river. It is admitted by the complainant, that the commissioners
.of Massachusetts acted in good faith: and yet the agreement is to
be cancelled.
Fraud; actual fraud, would not set aside an' agreement, after so
much time had elapsed. If a party has slept on his case, or has
suffered others to act under the belief that the subject was fully and
finally arranged, Courts of Equity would not interfere after nearly
two centuries had gone by; and property had been acquired, civil
rights asserted, and undisturbed, during the whole of that long period.
Although no attempt is made to change or affect the tenures of pioperty, the civil rights of thousands are to be changed, and transferred
to another government to which they are strangers.
Again an authority for the grant, by the Court, of the object of
the complainant's bill,' is asked for. Where is the case in which
such relief has been sought? Where is the instance in which it has
been -given? It is true, that on the- application of Rhode Island,
commissioners have at different times been appointed by Massachusetts,'and those commissioners have met with commissioners appointed on her part. This is a proper course of proceeding between,
states, ' A sovereign state must be heard, whatever may be the subject of her complaint. Subjects in controversy between states are
not to be settled without delays and grave consideration. Respect
isalways to be given to applications by states to other political communities. But with all this courtesy and just regard to the dignity,
and just right of the state of Rhode Island to be respected, the state
of Massachusetts has never receded from the line established by
the Woodward and Saffr'ey station. Those acts of conciliation and

2510

SUPREME COURT.
(The State of Rhode Island vs The State of Massachusetts.]

international civility, do not affect the agreements of 1710 and 1721;
it being admitted that the possession of Massachusetts is in exact
harmony with them.
Thus, in international law, the case is against Rhode Island.
But we are willing to consider the case, as one to be decided by
the rules of Equity pleadings.
The complainant's bill would have been bad on a demurrer, in a
Court of Equity; because it sets out a bar to the defendant's case, and
does not set out sufficient to destroy it. Possession, in a Court of
Equity, is as certain a title to land, as in a Court of Law. It is
now held that a party may defend himself in equity by possession,
as well as at law. Elmondorf vs. Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152. 6 Cond.
Rep. 47.
It is to be considered by the Court that every thing stated in the
plea is true. • This is the necessary consequence of the position in
which the complainant is placed, by the effort he now makes to
show the Court the plea is insufficient.
It is admitted, the agreements between Rh'od Island and Massachusetts of 1710 and 1721, were fair, and were made with" full
knowledge of the subject of the agreements, or with a full opportunity to obtain such knowledge. Possession accompanied those
agreements, and was entirely consistent with them ; and they have
never
or abandoned.
. Thisbeen-rescinded
brings back the
argument to the question of mistake. It is
said that the plea shuts out Rhode Island from her proof. But
Rhode Island can prove nothing more than she has stated in her
bill. Take all that is stated in the bill to be true; and Massachusetts
alleges it is not sufficient to set aside the agreements.
This Court cannot know more than the commissioners on behalf
of Rhode Island, and on behalf of Massachusetts, knew in 1710. The
ground of the assertion of mistake is not sufficient to open the controversy.
Can 'controversies be never settled when parties say there has
been a mistake? 2 Powell on Contracts, 90. The unreasonablenes5 of a contract is not a ground to set it aside.
Another well established principle is, that when a thing is doubtful and uncertain', a settlement between the parties, is conclusive.

It is said the defendant has not answered the bill: but this is the
very question before the Court. The plea and answer of the defendant are now under examination; and it will be for the Court to decide
upon their sufficiency, and whether they will sustain the defendant's
claim to be dismissed from any further action in the case. If the
party had deemed the plea insufficient, he might have excepted to it,
and have brought in other matter. This he has not done; but be
asks the Court to decide on the insufficiency of the plea and answer.
This is altogether irregular. i Story's Equity, 528, sect. 684. Mitford's Pleading, 200. Beames' Equity, 248. 1 Vernon's Rep. 185.

What is it that the defendant should have denied ? The rule of
a Court of Equity is, that the plea or answer should deny the final
result of all the allegations; hot each particular matter which may
in itself be true. The permission which is given to the defendant
to deny the whole charge of the bill, is essential to the existence and
validity of a plea in bar. Beames' Equity, 37. 5 Brown's Part.
Cases, 552. Gilbert's Equity, 184. Cooper's Equity, 328.
There must be something not denied by the plea, upon which the
Court can give a decree for the plaintiff. If there is not enough left
undenied, sufficient to make a case for relief or recovery, none can
be granted. The plaintiff might allege twenty facts, either quite
immaterial, or even, perhaps, material in some degree, or as matter
of evidence, which the defendant could not deny. For instance, the
complainant avers that Dudley and Jenckes did not go on the ground
to examine it. The defendants are not obliged to deny that; for the
agreement may be good, if fair, though the fact were as is averred.
So the bill avers the discontent of Rhode Island; an ex parte line
having been determined upon. That may be so; but that does not
set aside the agreement. Massachusetts, it is asserted, appointed
commissioners to meet commissioners appointed by Rhode Island.
That may be so; but the agreement was in full operation.
Every thing alleged to have happened after 1719 is called for, for
the purpose of proving some waver, recession, or abandonment of
the agreement. If that were not the design, it had no object.
Now the plea meets and, denies the general fact, which all these
things are said to prove. Denying the general fact, we need not
deny each of the circumstances relied upon as -proof.
There is a difference in this respect between the case
now betore
the Court, and a case where fraud is charged. Any fraud, little or
great, zitiates: every mistake does not. Any one circumstance
amounting to fraud, proves fraud.
Suppose the complainant had charged, in direct terms, an, abandonment of the agreement of 1710: it would have been enough for
the defendant to have denied the abandonment in general terms.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.
When this case was last before the Court, Massachusetts had not
made her election, whether she would continue her appearance to
the suit, or withdraw it according to the leave previously granted.
She has since that time made her election, by~putting in ier plea to
the amended bill of the complainant; and both parties are now regularly before the Court.
' In the present stage of the case, the question is upon the sufficiency of the plea, as a bar to the relief sought by the complainant's
bill. The object of the bill is to establish the boundary bet'ween the
two states, according to their respective charters; and to be restored
to the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over that portion of her

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

territory of which she alleges that Massachusetts has unjustly deprived htr.
The bill states the various charters from the crown to the colonies
of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, from 1621, to

1691

; and avers

that, by virtue of the charter of Rhode Island, the'boundary between her and Massachusetts was a line run east and west, three
miles south of Charles river, or any or every part thereof; that the
place of the said line being unsettled and in dispute between the
tWAo colonies, commissioners were mutualy appointed to ascertain
and settle it ; that these commissioners met in 1710 ; and that the
commissioners of Massachusetts then represented that a certain Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey had, a long time before,
ascertained the point three miles south of Charles river, and had set
up a stake there ; and that the commissioners of Rhode Island, relying on these representations, and believing them to be true, entered
into the agreement of 1710, which is recited at large in the bill; and
which adopts the place marked by Woodward and Saffrey, as the
commencement of the line between Massachusetts and Rhode
Island.
The bill further states, that no mark, stake,, or monLment at that
time existed; and that the persons who consented to the pretended
agreement, did not go to the place where it was alleged to have
been set up, nor make any survey, nor take any measuresto ascerthin whether the place was, in fact, three miles, and no more, south
of Charles river.
That the said agreement was never asented to or ratified by the
colony or the state of Rhode Island ; and that the trait of one mile
in breadth, referred to in the agreement, was never conveyed to or
enjoyed by the town of Providence, or the colony of Rhode Island;
and that no persons appointed by the governor and council of the
said two governments of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, within
the space of six months from the date of the agreement, or at any
other tim;e, showed the line of Woodward and Saffrey, or raised oi
renewed any marks, stakes, or other memorials, according to the

terms of the said pretended agreement.
The bill then proceeds to state the continuance of the controversy
about the boundary, and the appointment of commissioners by both
colonies, in 1717 and 1718; that they met in 1718, and that the like

representations, as those charged to have taken place at the former
meeting of the commissioners, were again made by the commissioners of Massachusetts; that they were again believed by the commissioners of Rhode Island; and the agreement of the 22d of October,
1718, executed by them under that mistake. This agreement is set
out at length. The coknplainants aver that the commissioners did
not go to the place where the stake was alleged to iave been set up,
or make any survey in relation to this agreement. These axerments
are, in substance, the same with those made in relation to the agretWent of 1710, The bill then sets out an order of the General Assembly of Rhode Island, directing the return of the commissioners

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

253

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

to be accepted and placed to record on the colony book; but the
complainants aver that the last mentioned agreement was never ratified by either Rhode Island or Massachusetts.
The bill then sets out the running of the line, under the belief on
the part of the Rhode Island commissioners, that it was only three
miles south of Charles river, when it was in fact more than seven;
sets out, at large, their report of the running, which is dated May 14,
1719, and that the return was approved by the General Assembly
of Rhode land; 13ut the bill avers that the persons who signed that
report, were never authorized by Rhode Island to run, agree upon,
or report said line, and had.no legal authority to act in the premises;
and that Massachusetts, about the time last mentioned, wrongfully
pcssessed herself of the disputed territory, and hasheld it ever since.
The bill further states, that the line run as aforesaid was never
established by any act binding upon the complainant; on the contrary, she has always claimed that the true dividing line was three
miles south of Charles river : that she has never acquiesced in the
claim of Massachusetts to a different line; and that the claim of
Rhode Island was publicly and frequently urged by the colony, and
by the freemen and inhabitants thereof; that all the proceedings of
Rhode Island before mentioned, were founded on the mistaken belief that the stake set up by Woodward and Saffrey, and the line
run as aforesaid, was only three miles south of Charles river; that
this mistaken belief continued until about 1749; that controversies
existing during that period between the citizens of the two colonies
in relation to the boundary, Rhode Island, in the year last mentioned, appointed certain persons to run the line, when it became manifest that the line run as above mentioned in 1-719, was more than
three miles south of Charles river.
The bill then states the negotiations and other proceedings of the
two colonies in relation to this boundary; that commissioners were
appointed on both sides to run the'line; that it was actually run, as
now claimed by the complainant, by the commissioners of Rhode
Island, in the absence of the commissioners of Massachusetts,; who
refused to attend. All of thesb things are particularly set out in the
bill; and also that Rhode Island attempted to obtain the decision of
the king in council ; and the failure is accounted for by the poverty
of the colony at that time, and the war which shortly afterwards
broke out between France .and England; that the war of the Revolution, which soon followed, interrupted and defeated the attempt to
obtain the decision of the king in council ; that in 1782, the legislature of Rhode Island again took up the subject, and appointed a
committee, who reported in favour of the claim now made by the
complainant; that in 1791, the two states mutually appointed comsioners to adjust this boundary, who met together in that year; and
at that meeting, the commissioners on the part of Massachusetts
acknowledged, and also set forth in their report subsequently made
to the legislature, that the pretended agreement of 1719, herein
before mentioned, had never been ratified either by Massachusetts
VOL. XIV.-Y

254

SUPREME COURT
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

or Rhode Island, which report was accepted by the legislature; that
the commissioners- of the two states, being unable to agree upon the
boundary, entered into a written agreement, which is set out in the
bill, recommending to thd two states to submit the matter to indifferent men of the neighbouring states; or to unite in an application
to Congress to settle the same agreeably to the respective charters,
and the Constitution of the United States; that the said commissioners, in 1792, reported their proceedings to their respective states, and
the agreement made by. them as aforesaid -'which said reports were,
received and accepted by the legislatures of Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, the one made to Massachusetts being set out at large, as an
exhibit to complainant's bill; that other-commissioners were afterwards appointed on both sides, and were continued until the year
1818; that they had several meetings, but were unable to agree
upon and settle the line.
The bill then charges that Massachusetts has wrongfully continued to hold possession, and exercise jurisdiction within the charter boundary of Rhode Island; that the agreements of 1710, and
1718, were unfair and inequitable, and executed by mistake, as
before mentioned; that the line as run, is not in a west course from
the place of beginning, but is south of a west course, thus taking
in a part of Rhode Island, even according to the point alleged to
have been ascertained and marked by Woodward and Saffrey; that
the agreements of 1710, and 1718, herein before mentioned, were
never ratified by Massachusetts or Rhode Island; and if they had
been so ratified by the colonies, they would not have been binding
without the consent of the king in council, which was never given
to either of them.
And the bill concludes with an averment that Rhode Island has
imiformly resisted the claim of Massachusetts; has never claimed
or admitted any other boundary than the one according to the charter; and prays for an answer to all the matters charged, and to
sundry special interrogatories put in the bill : and that the northern
boundary of the state may be ascertained and established, and
Rhode Island restored to the exercise and enjoyment of her rights
of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory to which she is
entitled by her charter limits.
To this bill Massachusetts has put in her plea and answer; in
which she sets forth, that in the year 1642, for the purpose of ascertaining and establishing her true southern boundary, a station, or
monument was erected at a point then believed to be on the true
aied real boundary line of the said colony, and a lizie continued
therefrom westwardly to Connecticut river; that the said station or
monument then became, and ever since has been well known ard
notorious,.and then-was and ever since has been called Woodward
and Saffrey's station; that Massachusetts afterwards held and possessed jurisdiction up to this line, and while she so held and possessed it, about the year 1709, a dispute arose between the two
governments of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, respecting this

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

255

(The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

boundary line, and commissioners were appointed by both colonies
to settle it; and that whatever they should agree upon, should forever after be taken to be the stated lines and bounds; that the conmissioners met, pursuant to their authority, and entered into the
agreement of 1710, which is set out at large.
The plea then avers, that the whole merits of the complainant's
claim, was heard, tried, and determined by this judgment and
agreement of the commissioners; that the agreement was fair, legal,
and binding between the parties; and was in all respects a valid and
effectual settlement of the matter in controversy; and was had and
made without fraud, cbvin, or misrepresentation, and with a full
and equal knowledge of all the circumstances by both parties; and
that the same is still in full force, no way waived, abandoned, or
relinquished; that Woodward and Saffrey's station was then well
known, and the place where it was fixed a matter of common notoriety; and the line run therefrom capable of being shown and ascertained, and the marks, stakes, and memorials there, are easily capable
of being discovered and renewed ; and that the defendant has held
and possessed the land, property, and jurisdiction, according to the
said station and the line running therefrom, from the date of the
said agreement to the present time ; without hinderance or molestation. The plea then sets forth the proceedings of Massachusetts'
and Rhode-Island, in 1717, appointing commissioners to settle the
boundary ;,the meeting of these commissioners, and their agreement in 1718, which is set out-at large in the plea; and which the defendant avers was accepted by Rhode Island, and caused to be duly
recorded, and that the same was thereby ratified and confirmed.
The plea further avers, that no false repiesentations were made
on this occasion by the commissioners of Massachusetts; that the
agreement was concluded in good faith, with a full and equal knowledge of all the circumstances, by the respective parties; and that
the same has never been rescinded or abandoned; that it was made
in pursuance of the first agreement before mentioned, in 1709, and in
completion thereof; the plea then sets out at large, the report made
by the commissioners in 1719, stating, the manner in which the line
was run ; and avers that the report was approved by the General
Assembly of Rhode Island,in the 16th of June, 1719; and that
from the date of said agreement to the present time, Massachusetts
has possessed all the territory, and exercised jurisdiction over'the
same, north of the said line, as prescribed in the said agreements
of October, 1718, without hinderance or molestation.
The plea then says: "4And the said defendant doth plead the
said agreement of January 19th, 1710; and the said agreement in
pursuance and confirmation thereof of the 22d of October, 1718,
and unmolested possession according to the same from the date of
the said agreements, in bar to the whole bill of complaint of the
said complainant, and against any other or further relief therein;
and doth pray the judgment of the Court, whether the said defend-

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

ant ought further to answer the said bill, and that said defendant
may be dismissed with costs in this behalf sustained."
Then follows an answer in support of the plea, which it is unnecessary to repeat. The plea was set down for argument upon the
motion of the complainant; and the question now to be decided
is, whether this plea is a bar to the complainant's bill.
In the view we have taken of the subject, it has become necessary to set out, in much detail, the contents both of the bill and the
plea, in order to show the principles on which the opinion of the
Court is founded. The controversy concerns, altogether, the southern
boundary of Massachusetts, and. the northern boundary of Rhode
Island. The bill sets out the judgmeit given in 1684, in the Cburt
of Chancery of England, declaring the original charter of Massachusetts to be vacated, and that the enrolment of the same
should be cancelled; and also sets forth the letters patent afterwards,
granted to Massachusetts by William and Mary, in 1691, which
was subsequent to the charter,of Rhode Island. How far this fact
may or may not be material, it would not be proper for us now to
inquire. We advert to it merely to show the character of the controversy. The complainant insists in her' bill, that Massachusetts
has encroached upqn her; and instead of coming three miles south
of Charles river, fo the southern line, the one to which she claims
and holds is more thansQven. The defendant, it will he observed,
does net, in her plea, deny that the charter line of Massachusetts is
such as the complainant describes; nor does the defendant deny,
that the line to which Massachusetts now holds, and to which she
insists that she has 4 right to hold, is four miles further south than.
that described in th6 cliarter; but she relies upon the vircumstances
set forth in her plea and answer, as conclusive proofs of her right,
as against the complainant, at this time, whatever may have been
the true boundary line between them according to the terms of the
original charters.
Th3 case to be determined is one of peculiar 'character, and altogether unknown in the ordinary course of judicial proceedings. It
is a question of boundary between two sovereign states, litigated in
a Court of justice; and we hsve no precedents to guide us in the
forms and modes of proceeding, by which, a controversy of this
description can most conveniently, and with justice to the parties,
be brought to a final hearing. The subject was however fully considered at January term, 1838, when a motion' was made by the
defendant to dismiss this bill. Upon that occasion the Court deterrained to frame their proceedings according to those which had been
adopted in the English Courts, in cases most analogous to this, where
the boundaries of great political bodies had been brought into question. 'And acting upon this principle, it was then decided, that the
rules and practice of the Court of Chancery should govern in conducting this suit to a final, issue. The reasoning upon which ihat
decision was founded, is fully stated in the opinion then delivered;

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

257

[The State of Rhode Island v3. The State of Massachusetts.]

and upon re-examining the subject, we are quite satisfied as to the
correctness of this decision. 12 Peters, 735. 739.
The proceedings in this case will therefore be. regulated by the
rules and usages of the Court of Chancery. Yet, in a controversy
where two sovereign states are contesting' the boundary between
them, it will be the duty of the Court to mould the rules of Chancery practice and pleading, in such a manner as to bring this case to
a final hearing on its real merits. It-is too important in its character, and the interests concerned too great, to be decided upon the
mere technical principles of Chancery pleading. And if it appears
that the plea put in by the defendant may in any degree embarrass
the complainant in bringing out the proofs of her claim, on which
she relies, the case ought not to be disposed of on .such an issue.
Undoubtedly the defendant must have the full benefit of the defence
which the plea discloses; but at the same time, the proceedings
ought to be so, ordered as to give the complainant a full hearing
upon the whole of her case. In ordinary cases between individuals, the Court of Chancery has always exercised an equitable disc: etion in relation to its rules of pleading, whenever it has been found
necessary to do so for the purposes of justice. And in a case like the
present, the most liberal principles of practice and pleading ought
unquestionably to be adopted, in order to enable both parties to present their respective claims in their full strength.
According to the rules of pjeading in the Chancery Court, if the
plea is unexceptionable in its form and character, the complainant
must either set it down for argument, or he must reply to it, and put
in issue the facts'relied on in the plea. If he elects to proceed in
the manner first mentioned, and sets down-the plea for argument,
he then admit, 'he truth of all the facts stated in the plea, and merely
denies their sufficiency in point of law to prevent his recovery.
If, on the other hand, he replies to~thq plea, and denies the trutb of
the facts therein stated, he then adinits that if the particular facts
stated in the plea are true, they are then sufficient in law to bar his
recovery: and if they are proved to be true, the bill must be dismisid, without reference to the equity arising from any other facts
stated, in the bill. 6 Wheat. 472. Undoubtedly, if a plea upon
argument isruled to be sufficient in law to bar the recovery of the
complainant, the Court of Chancery would, according to its uniform
practice, allow him to amend; and to put in issue, by a proper replication, the truth of the facts stated in the plea. But in either case,
the controversy would turn altogether upon the facts stated in the
plea, if the plea is permitted to stand. It is the strict and technical
character of these rules of pleading, and the danger of injustice often
arising from them, which has given rise to the equitable discretion
always exercised by the Court of Chancery in relation to pleas. In
maay cases, where they are not overruled, the Court will not peria them to have the full effect of a plea; and will in some cases
save to the defendant the benefit of it at the hearing; and in others
y 2,

33

258

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The'State of Massachusetts.]

will order it to stand for an answer, as in the judgment of the Court
may best subserve the purposes of justice.
In the opinion of this Court, it was evident from the argument
we have heard, that if the plea stans, the case must be finally disposed of, upon an issue highly disadvantageous to Rhode Island.
For by setting down the plea for argument, that state is compelled
to admit the truth of all the facts stated in it, many of which are
directly at variance with the allegations contained in the bill. Thus,
for example, the complainant avers, that the persons who signed, in
her behalf, the agreement of May 14th, 1719, had no legal authority to act in the premises. In the plea and answer of the defendant, it is averred that they had authority. The bill charges, that
the Rhode Island commissioners acted under a mistake; that the
commissibners of Massachusetts represented to them that the stake
set up, by Woodward and Saffrey was only three miles south of
Charles river; and that they believed the representation, and acted
upon it, when in truth the stake was seven miles south of that river.
The plea on the contrary avers, that the agreement was made with
a full and equal knowledge of all the circumstances by the respective
parties. There are differences also between the bill and the plea,
in relation to the nature and -character of the possession held by
Massachusetts, of t e dispute'd territory.
If we proceed toldecide the case upon the plea, we must assume,
without' any proof on either side, that the facts above mentioned are
correctly stated in the plea, and incorrectly set forth in the bill.
This is the rule of the Chancery law. Yet it is evident, that by
deciding the case upon such an issue, we should shut out the very
gist of the complainant's case; and exclude the facts upon which her
whole equity is founded, if she has any. Because, if we assume,
as we must do in this state of the pleading, that the agreements,
which are admitted on both sides to have'been made, were made
by persons having competent authority to make them, and who had
full knowledge of all the circumstances; and that Massachusetts had
quietly and peacetbly enjoyed the territory, under this agreement,
for more than a century; every one, we presume, would admit that
the claim of Rhode Island to unsettle this boundary, at this late day,
was utterly groundless and untenable. Yet this is the at'itude in
which Rhode Island must stand upon the issue framed by the plea;
the allegations in her bill, above mentioned, must be rejected as erroneous, without giving her an opportunity of proving them; and her
claim to this territory must be decided, upon a statement of facts,
the truth of which she utterly denies, and which she offers to prove
are entirely erroneous, if the Court will consent to hear her testimony. We do not mean to say that the facts stated in the bill, if
proved to be true, will entitle the complainant to recover. That point
is not before us in the present state of the pleadings; and we give
no opinion on the merits of this controversy. But certainly it would
be unjust to the complainant not to give her an opportunity of being

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

259

[The State of Rhode Island v. The State of Massachusett&]

heard, according to the real state of the case between the parties;
and to shut out from consideration the very facts upon which she
relies to mnintain her suit.:
If the complainant takes issue on the facts stated in the plea, her
condition would be equally unfavourable. For there are many facts
upon which the complainant eVidently relies as material, which are
altogether unnoticed in the plea, and upon which, therefore, no issue
would be framed. And if the eomplainant were to adopt this alternative, she'would admit, according to the 'Chancery rules of pleading, that all of the allegations contained in her'.bill were immaterial
and of no importance, except those noticed in the plea: and that if the
facts averred in the plea turned out to be true, the complainant had
no right to recover, whatever equities might be found in the other
allegations in the bill; and whatever proofs she might be ready toadduce in support of these allegations.
In either alternative, therefore, it would be manifestly unjust to
thecomplainant, to decide this controversy upon the plea; and if
it was deemed good in form and substance, so far as the case is
already presented to the Court; we still should not finally decide the
controversy on this plea, but save the benefit of it to the hearing,
and give the complainant as well as the defendant, the opportunity
of bringing forward all the merits of his ease. But the plea put in
by the defendant cannot be sustained, even if this were to be treated
as a suit between individuals, and tried by the ordinary rules of
Chancery pleading. It is multifarious, and on that account ought
to be overruled.
It is a general rule, that a plea ought not to contain -more defences than one. Various facts, therefore, can never be pleaded in
.one plea; unless they are all conducive to a single point, on -vhich
the defendant means to rest his defence. This principle is so well
established, that it is unnecessary to refer to many adjudged cases
to support it. It is fully stated by Lord Hardwicke, in 1 Atk. 54,
in the following words: "The defence proper for a plea, must be
such as reduces the cause to a particular point, and from thence
creates a barito the suit,,and is to save the parties expense in examination ;,and it is not every good defence in 'equity that is like.wise good as a plea; for where the defefnce consists of a variety of
circumstances, there is no use of a plea, the examination must still
be at large, and the effect of allowing such a plea, will be, that the
Court will give their jhdgment on the circumstances of the case,
before they are made out by proof."
The defendant, after stating the various proceedings herein before
mentioned, which preceded and followed the executun of.the agreements on which he relies, all of which conduce to a single point,
that is, to show the obligatory and conclusive effect of those agreements upon both of the states, as an accord and compromise of a
disputed right, deliberately made, and with full knowledge on both
sides; proceeds to aver, "that the defendant has occupied and exercised jurisdiction, and enjoyed all rights and sovereignty, according

260

SUREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

to the same, from the date hereof to the present time." And he
then sums up his defence in the following words:
"And the said defendant doth plead the said agreement of the
19th January, 1710, and the said agreement in pursuance 'and confirmation thereof of the 22d October, 1718, and unmolested possession, according to the same, from the date of the said agreements,
in bar to the whole bill of complaint of the said complainant; and
against any further or other reliefs therein."
The defence set up by this plea is twofold: 1. That there was an
accord and compromise of a disputed right. 2. Prescription, or an
unmolested possession from the time of the agreement, that is, of
more than one hundred years. These two defences are entirely
distinct, and depend upon different principles. If what the defendant alleges be true, then the agreements themselves conclude the
controversy. For if, as the plea avers, there was a dispute between
these two colonies, in respect to the boundary between them, and
that dispute was settled by persons dily authorized to bind the
respective parties ; and if, as stated in the plea, the agreement of
October 1718, to run the line from the stake set up by Woodward
and Saffrey, was accepted, ratified, and confirmed by Rhode Island;
and if the running of the line afterwards in 1719, pursuant to such
agreement, was also approved by Rhode Island; then there can no
longer be any controversy between them. They must, on both sides,
be bound by the accord and compromise of those whom they had authorized to bind them, and whose conduct they afterwards approved;
provided the settlement was made, as the plea alleges, with a full
and equal knowledge of all the circumstances. The various facts
stated by the defendant, in relation to these agreements, contribute
to support them, and conduce to establish this point of his defence.
And, assuming that the plea and answer are true in all these statements, then an accord and compromise is established, which was
obligatory upon the parties from the moment it was finally ratified.
And taking every thing averred by the defendant on this point of
the defence to be correct, Rhode Island would have been as effectually barred as she is at the present mament, if she had commenced
this controversy within a month after the accord was'-made. The
lapse of time is not at all necessary to give validity to such a settlement; or to support the defence founded upon it. It is a matter
entirely distinct frori it; and if it has any operation in the cause, it
is another defence, and one of a differeht character. It is not an
accord and compromise of a doubtful right-it is prescription.
Rhode Island, indeed, avers, that the possession was constantly
disputed on her part, and efforts made from time to time to regain
it; and that it has always been an open question, since the error in
the line was first discovered, down to the present time. But, as we
have already remarked, when the plea is set down for argument,
the statements contained in it are admitted to be true. And according to the allegations there made, this long possession was unmolested. In that state of the fact, separated from all the averments

JANUAZY TERM, 1840.

261

[The State of Xthode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

of Rhode Island, the possession of more than one hundred years
would become a rightful one by prescription; even if it had begun
in wrong and injustice. The acquiescence of the adjoining state
for such a "lapse of time, would be conclusive evidence that she
assented to the possession thus held, 'and had determined to relinquish her claims. The possession, therefore, if a defence at all, is
a separate and complete one of itself; and forms no part of the
accord and agreement alleged in the plea. Here, then, are two
defences in the same plea; contrary to the established rules of
pleading.
A few cases will illustrate these principles, and show what constitutes duplicity in pleading. In the case of Whitebread vs. Brockhur,, I Br. Ch. Rep. 404, where to a bill for a specific performance
of an agreement, the defendant put in a plea which averred two
facts: first, that there was no agreement in writing; and, secondly,
that there had been no acts done in part performance: Lord Thurlow overruled the plea as double, it containing two different points,
ana therefore, proper for an answer. And in delivering his opinion
on that occasion, he says, "the use of a plea here is to save time,
expense, and vexation; therefore, if one point will put an end to
the whole cause, it, is important to the administration of justice
that it should be pleaded; but if you are to state many mattets, the
answer is the most commodious form to do it in." We are aware
that this decision has been questioned. But it is quoted with approbation, and recognised as ".authority in 7 Johns. Ch. Cases, 216 ;
where Chancellor Kent, speaking of the case of Whitebread vs.
Brockhurst, says, "the reasoning of Lord Thurlow is supposod to
be weighty.and decisive; and since that time it has been the constant language of the Court, that the plea must reduce the defence
to a single point, and that a defendant can never plead double."
Again, in the case of Claridge vs. Hoare, 14 Ves. 65,66, Lord Eldon,
in speaking of the case of Beachcroft vs. Beacheroft, where it had
been held that the plea of a release, with an averment that it had
been acted upon, was multifarious, expressed his doubts of that decision, upon the ground that the release was effectual without being
acted upon, and the latter averment might have been rejected as
surplusage. The reasoning of Lord Eldon shows that if the second
averment would have been a good point of defence, the plea would
have been bad. The acting upon the release, in Beacheroft vs.
Beachcroft, was altogether unimportant, and could not, if true, affect
the rights of the parties. But not so, as to the possession here
pleaded. If true, as pleaded, it is of itself a defence, and could not
therefore be rejected as surplusage. The case of The Corporation
of London vs. The Corporation of Liverpool, 8 Anst. Rep. 738, also
illustrates and supports the principle we have stated. It is unnecessary, however, to multiply uases on this subject. They are all
collected together in Story's Equity Pleading, whert--the subject is
very fully examined. We hold it to be perfectly clear,ithat in the,
case of an individual, the plea of a release and of the statute of

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

limitations; or of an award and the statute of limitations; could not
be upited in the same plea. And if so, it would seem irresistibly to
follow, that the accord and compromise, and the title by prescription, united in this plea, render it multifarious; and that it ought to
be 'overruled on that account.
We have carefully avoided expressing any opinion upon the
merits of this controversy; and have confined ourselves to the case
as presented to the Court by the' pleadings. The facts stated in the
bill, and not noticed in the plea, are not yet admitted or denied; and
consequently we do not know in what form the casd may ultimately
come here for decision.
In the case of Rowe vs. Tweed, 15 Ves. 377, 378, Lord Eldon

remarks, that "the office of a plea generally is not to deny the
equity, but to bring forward a fact, which, if true, displaces it." A
plea, therefore, in general,,presupposes that the bill contains equitable matter, which the defendant by his plea' seeks to displace. It
is according to this principle of equity pleading that we have treated.
the case before us. If a defendant supposes that there is no equity
in the bill, his appropriate answer to it is a demurrer; which brings
forward at once the whole case for argument. The case of Milligan vs. Mitchell, 3 Cranch, 220. 228, illustrates this rule, and shows
that the def~nce here taken was more proper for an answer or demurrer than a plea.
The, course 'determined on recommends itself strongly to the
Court, because it appears to be the only mode in which full justice
can be done to both parties. Each will now be able to come to the
final hearing, upon the real merits of their respective claims, unembarrassed by any technical rules. Such, unquestionably, is the attitude in which the parties ought to be placed in relation to each
other. If the defendant supposes that the bill does not disclose a
case which entitles Rhode Island to the relief she seeks; the whole
subject can be brought to a hearing by a demurrer to the bill. If it
is supposed that any facts are misconceived by the complainants,
and therefore erroneously stated; the defendants can put these in
issue by answering the bill. T'ie whole case is open; and upon
the rule to answer which the Court will lay upon the defendant,
Massachusetts is entirely at liberty to demur or answer, as she may
deem best for her own interests..
Mr. Justice M'LEAN.

The Massachusetts charter was granted by King Charles the First,
and is dated the 4th March, 1628. It conveyed to Sir Henry Rosewell and others, "all that part of New England, in America, which
lies and extends between a great river, there commonly called Monomack, alias Merimac, and a certain other river called Charles
river, &c.; and also all and singular those lands and hereditaments
whatsoever, lying within the space of three English miles on the
south part of the said Charles river, or of any or every part thereof," &c.

JANUARY TERM, , 1840.

[The State of Rhode Island ts..The State of Massachugetts.]

On the 8th July, 1663, King Charles thg Second granted the charter of Rhode Island, "bounded on the -west,or westerly, to the middle
or charel of a river there, commonly called and known by the
name of Pawcatuck river, and so alopg the said river, as the greater
or middle stream thereof reaches or lies up into the north country t
northward unto the head thereof, and from thence by a straight lino
drawn due north until it meets with the south line of the Massachusetts; and on the north or northerly, by the aforesaid south or south.
erly line of the Massachusetts colony or plantations," &c.
. The line which limits Massachusetts on the south, and Rhode
Island on the north, is the subject matter of controversy in this case.
The bill states, that for many years after the Rhode Island charter
was granted, the northern part of the colony, adjoining Massachusetts, remained wild and uncultivated; and the land was of little
value: that a short time previous to the year one thousdnd seven
hundred and nine, a dispute arose respecting the northern boundary;
and that Massachusetts appointed one Joseph Dudley on her part,
and the General Assembly of Rhode Island appointed and empowered oie Joseph Jenckes on her part, to ascertain and settle the disputed line: that these persons met, together with one 'Nathaniel
Paine, one Nathaniel Blagrove, and one Samuel Thaxter, of Massachusetts; and one Jonathan Sprague, and one Samuel Wilkinson,
of Rhode Island; at Roxbury, in Massachusetts, the 19th January,
1710: and that the said Joseph Dudley, Nathaniel Paine, Nathaniel
Blagrove, and Samuel Thaxter, representod to the said Jenckes,
Sprague, and Wilkinson, that one Nathaniel Woodward, and one
Solormon Saffrey; who, they also represented to be skilful and approved artists; had, before that time, that is to say, in 1642, ascertained the point or place, three English miles south of the river called
Charles, river, or of any or every part thereof, and had there set up
a stake: and that Jenckes, Sprague, and Wilkinson, relying on their
representations, and believing the point or place to have been ascertained, and that it was three English mil6s, and no more, south of
Charles river, or of any or every part thereof; the said Dudley and
Jenckes, in the presence of, and with the advice of, the other persons named; signed and sealed a certain writing, called an agreement, that the boundary should be run from the stake set up by
Woodward and Saffrey.
And thn complainant states, that no stake or monument at that
time existed, by which could be ascertained the place where it was
set up by Woodward and Saffrey: that the agreement was entered
into without going to the place of beginning, and without ascertaining whether, it was not more than three miles south of Charles river;
and whether the line was run as stated in the agreement.
That neither the colony, nor the state of Rhode Island, has ever
assented to or confirmed the agreement; nor has the town of Providence, nor the colony, enjoyed the ti'act of land specified in the
agreement, of one mile in breadth, north of Woodward and Saffrey's
line: that this line was not shown nor run in six months after the

264

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

agreement; nor were any marks, stakes, or other memorials made,
to identify the place of beginning..
That this controversy respecting the line continued; and that
Massachusetts, on the 18th June, 1717, enacted an order, in the words
following: "The season of the year having been such, this spring,
that the committee appointed in November last, to run the line
between this government' and the government of Rhode Island,
could not atteid the service, ordered: that the honourable Nathaniel Paine, Esquire, Samuel Thaxter,*Esquire, and John Chandler,
Esquire, be a committee to join with such as the said government
of Rhode Island shall empower, to proceed in and perfectthe running and settling the line between this province and the said colony,
pursuant to the agreement lately made for that end by commissioners of both governments," &c. And on the 16th November, 1717,
the, General Court of Massachusetts resolved, that Nathaniel Blagrove, Esquire, be added to the committee., And afterwards the
General Court resolved, that ,2whereas this house is informed that
the, government of Rhode Island have fully empowered the committee, which they have appointed, to run the line between this province and that government; to agree, compromise, and issue the
governments on that affair, and finally settle the dividing boundary:
Resolved, thiit if the said committee shall attend that service, so empowered, that the committee appointed by this Court to join in run'ing the said line, be also vdsted with like powers; and are hereby
fully empowered to agree, compromise, and issue the difference
between the governments in the said affair; and to make a full and
final settlement of the line between that government and this."
That on the 17th June, 1718, the Assembly of Rhode Island
passed ihe following act: "Whereas the committee appointed and
empowered by the General Assembly of this colony, at their sessions, on the first Wednesday. of May,. 1717, to perfect and settle
the line between the said colony and the province of Massachusetts
bay, were bound up or restricted to an agreement made at Roxbury
between Colonel .Dudleyland Major Jenckes, &c., so as the matter
in difference betw'een the two colonies, as to the stating and settling
the said line hath been retarded, to the considerable charge of the
colony, this Assembly, taking the premises under consideration, do
hereby, enact, constitute, and appoint, Major Joseph Jenclds, Major
Randal Holding, Major Thomas Fry, Captain Samuel Wilkinson,
.and Mr. John Mumford, surveyor, a committee, to treat and agree
with such gentlemen as are or may be appointed and commissioned
by Massachusetts to settle the line," &c.
That on the 2d October, 1718, the commissioners on both sides
met at Rehoboth, and, after discussing the subject, entered into an
agreement under their hands and seals. " that the stake set up by
Woodward and Safrey, in 1642, upon Wrentham plain, be the station or commencement of the line," &c.
The complainant alleges that this agreement was also entered into
without examination of the place where the stake was originally set

up; and without ascertaining whether the place was not more than
three English miles south of Charles river, or of any o- every part
thereof. That the Rhode Island commissioners believed the statements made to them on this subject, by the commissioners of Massachqsetts.,
The Rhode Island commissioners made a return of their proceedings to their legislature; who accepted it, and ordered it to be
recorded.
On the ith May, 1719, the commissioners on both sides run the
line, beginning at the place where it was supposed the stake had
been erected by Woodward and Saffrey; but which stake was not
fodnd, and was more than seven miles from Charles river, or any
or every part thereof. The commissioners made a return of their
survey, which was received and approved of by the legislature of
Rhode Island. But the complainant alleges that the persons making
the survey were not authorized to act in the premises by Rhode
Island. And the bill states the line was never confirmed by Rhode
Island ; that the colony maintained that the true line was to begin
three miles south of Charles river: and the complainant avers that
all the above proceedings and agreements were founded upon the
belief that the point or place three English mile south of Charles
river, or of any or every part thereof, had been correctly and truly
ascertained by Woodward and Saffrey.
In the year 1750, the General Assembly of Rhode Island passed
an act authorizing the boundary line to be run, and appointing cer.,
tain personsto perform this duty. In the preamble to this act, it is
stated that the line never has been settled and run according to the
royal charter; and that divers persons have set forth their right to
the Assembly to be under the jurisdiction of Rhode Island, instead
of that of Massachusetts. The commissioners appointe d by this
act, were authorized to meet any commissioners. appointed by Massachusetts, and to settle the boundary, and run the line. But if
Massachusetts should decline to act, then the Rhode Island com-missioners were required to run the line agreeably to the charter,
and make return of their proceed ings.
It is stated in the bill, -that commissioners were appointed by
Massachusetts, but they declined to meet the commissioners of
Rhode Island: who, after waiting two days near the place of beginning, proceeded, ex parte, to run the line, and make return thereof.
This report .was accepted by the Assembly, and the commissioners
were continued in office.
•The bill then states, that the Massachusetts commissioners, appointed as above, made a report of their proceedings to the council,
the 13th April, 1750.
*The bill further states, that remonstrances were made to Massachusetts, against its exercise of jurisdiction over the country within
the chirtered limits of Rhode Island, so long as the royal government continued ; that unsuccessful attempts were made to bring the
subject before the king in council; but the population of Rhode

Island being small, and her means limited, and war between England and France having soon after taken place, interposed insurmountable obstacles.
In the year 1782, on the petition of a large number of the inhabitants residing within the controverted limits, the Assemb]y of
Rhode Island made a report in favour of its claim.,
In the year 1791, the bill states, the legislature of Massachusetts
passed an act, duly appointing Walter Spooner, Elisha Mayard, and
David Cobb, commissioners, for ascertaining the boundary line between the said state of Massachusetts and the state of Rhode Island;
and that in the same year, the Rhode Island Assembly passed an act,
appointing William Bradford, Jabez Bowen, and Moses Brown,
commissioners, for ascertaining the boundary. These commissioners
met at Wrentham, in Massachusetts, in 1791, but they could not
agree on the line. They, however, agreed, in writing, to measure
from Charles river three miles south, as claimed by each state,as
the place of beginning; and io recommend to their respective
governments to have the dispute adjusted, by a reference of it to
disinterested persons, or by application to Congress.
These commissioners reported their proceedings to their respective
state:. And the bill further states, that inthe year 1809 the parties
again appointed commissioners, who continued in office until isiS;
but they were not able to settle the line.
*The state of Massachusetts pleads in bar to the bill, that in 1642,
for the purpose of ascertaining and establishing the true southern
boundary line of the colony of Massachusetts, a station or monument was erected and fixed at a point then taken and believed to
be on the true and real boundary line of said colony; and a line
continued therefrom westerly to Connecticut river; which said
monument or station then became and ever since has been well
known and notorious; and then was and ever since has been called
Woodward and Saffrey's Station, on Wrentham plains; and after
fixing of said station and runningthe line aforesaid, and after the
granting of the charier of Rhode Island, and while all the territory
north of said station and line was claimed, held, and possessed, a-od
jurisdiction over the same exercised and enjoyed by Massachusetts,
as parcel of her own territory, viz., in the year 1709, dispute4 having
arisen between the twolgovernments respecting the said boundary
line, under an act of the Assembly, the governor of Rhode Island
colony appointed Major Joseph Jenckes to meet with his excellency, Colonel Joseph Dudley, governor of Massachusetts, to settle
the boundary; and it was declared that what they should agree
upon shculd be forever after deemed the true boundary.
These persons met at Roxbury, in January 1710, 1111, and after
a full discussion of the subject, agreed that "the stake set up by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey, skilful and approved artists,
in the year 1642, and since that often renewed, in the latitude of
,forty-one degrees and fifty-five minutes, being three English miles
distant southward, from the southernmost part of the river called

Charles river, agreeably to the letters patent for the Massachusetts
province, be allowed on both sides the commencement of the line
between the Massachusetts and the colony Df Rhode Island, and to
be continued between the two governments, &c., as is deciphered
in the plan and tract of that line by Nathaniel Woodward and Solomon Saffrey, now shown forth to us, and is remaining on record
in the Massachusetts government."
"And whereas, upon presumption, by mistake or ignorance of
that line, the inhabitants of the town of Providence, in the colony
of Rhode Island, have surveyed' and laid out several lots and divisions of land to the northward of Woodward and Saffrey's line
aforesaid, on the Massachusetts side; it i* agreed that there shall be
and remain unto the said town of Providence, and inhabitants of
the government of Rhode Island, a certain tract of land of one
mile in breadth to the northward of said line, as described and
platted; beginning from the great river of Pautucket, and so to
proceed at the north side of the said patent line of equal breadth,
until it come to the place where Providence west line cuts the said
patent line, supposed to contain five thousand acres, be the same
more or less; the soil whereof shall be and remain to the town of'
Providence, or others, according to the disposition thereof 'to be
made by the government of Rhode Island aforesaid. Nevertheless,
to continue and remain within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts."
"And it was agreed that persons to be appointed respectively by
the two governments, should attend the first good seson, within
six months, to show the ancient line of Woodward and Saffrey, and
to raise and renew the marks and memorials of the same." '
This agreement was signed and sealed by Dudley and Jenckes,
in the presence and by the advice of Nathaniel Paine, Nathaniel
Blagrove, and Samnuel Thaxter, on the part of Massachusetts; and
by Jonathan Sprague, and Samuel Wilkinson, on the part of Rhode
Island.
"And the said defendant avers, that the whole real and true
merits of said complainant's supposed cause or causes of action,
were fully heard,. tried, and determined by the said Jenckes and
Dudley; that the said agreement was fair, legal, and binding between the parties; and was in all respects and all particulars, a
valid -and effectual settlement of the matter in controversy, and
was had and made without covin, fraud, or misrepresentation; and
with a full and equal knowledge of all circumstances, by both
parties."
And the plea further avers, that the 18th June, 1718, in order to
perfect and complete the running and settling of the line in pursuance of the above agreement, Nathaniel Paine, Samuel Thaxter,
and John Chandler, were appointed a committee by Massachusetts,
to which was afterwards added the name of Nathaniel Blagrove,
to unite with a committee that should be appointed by Rhode Island
for that purpose. And they were fully empowered to agree and
compromise the dispute. And Rhode Island adopted in its As-

2,68

JANUARY TERM, 184o.
[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

sembly the following act: "Whereas, the committee appointed and
empowered by the General Assembly of this colony, in May 1718,
to perfect" and settle the line between the said colony and that of
Massachusetts, were bound up or restricted to an agreement made
at Roxbury between-Colonel Dudley and Major Jenckes, &c., so as
the matter in difference between the two colonies, as to the stating
and settling the said line, hath been retarded, &c. And the Assembly
hereby enact, constitute, and appoint Major Joseph Jenckes, Major
Randal Holding, Major Thomas Fry, Captain Samuel Wilkinson,
and Mr. John Mumford, surveyor, a committee to treat and agree
with the committee of Massachusetts; and full power was given to
settle and compromise the controversy respecting the line. The
said committees having met at Rehoboth, in Massachusetts, entered
into an agreement under sea], that the stake set up by Woodward
and Saffrey in 1642, upon Wrentham plains, be the station from
which to begin the line which shall divide the two governments," &c.
This agreement, on the 29th October, 1718, was accepted by the
General Assembly of Rhode Island, and recorded; and was thereby
certified and confirmed by the same. And the plea avers that said
Paine, Blagrove, and Thaxter, or either of them, made no false representation whatsoever to the commissioners of Rhode Thla d; but
that the agreement was done and concluded fairly and in good faith,
with a full and equal knowledge of all the circumstances, by the res Jective parties.
The plea states that the Massachusetts commissioners made a report of their, proceedings, in regard to tlhe place of beginning and
the running of the line, which was approved by the legislature.
And that from the date of said agreements to the present time, Massachusetts has-possessed and enjoyed all the territory, and exercised
jurisdiction over the same, north of the said line; and that the place
where the stake was set up by Woodward and Saffrey is well
known, and has ever been notorious since the stake was set up.
And the aforesaid agreements, and the unmolested possession according to the same, are pleaded in bar.
And the defendant, not waiving said plea, pleaded as aforesaid,
but relying and insisting on the same, by way of answer, in support
of said plea, and 'to every thing alleged in said bill to show that the
said agreements ought *not to stand, and be allowed as good and
conclusive against the parties, and a valid and effectual bar, .&c.,
saith that the said agreements, &c., were fair and legal, obtained
without fraud or misrepresentation, and with a full and equal knowledge of all circumsLances in both parties; and that it was a valid
and effectual settlement of the matter in controversy: and that
it never has beer. in any way rescinded, abandonedt, or relinquished.
This case having assumed the forms of a Chancery proceeding,
the established rules of Chancery pleading must.govern it. In this
mode the points for decision are raised; but the Court, in deciding
the. questions involved, may apply principles of the common law,

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

269

(The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

of Chancery, or of national law; as they shall deem the circumstances of the case require.
The plea sets up certain agreements in bar of the relief prayed for,
which substantially appear upon the face of the bill; and it is insisted
that, in such case, a demurrer, and pot a plea in bar, is the proper
node of defence ; that the great object of the bill is to set aside these
agreements; and that, under such circumstances, they cannot be
pleaded in bar.
On general principles, it would seem to be unreasonable that the
complainant, by stating the matter in bar in his bill, should prevent
the respondent from pleading it. And such is not the established
rule in Chancery pleading.
A plea is a special answer to the bill, and generally sets ilp matter
in bar, which does not appear in the bill; but this is not always the
case.
An award may be pleaded to a bill, to set aside the award and
open the account.

These authorities show, that a plea in bar may embrace matters
stated in the bill. Where the matters in defence are fully stated in
the bill, and it contains no allegations which it is necessary to deny
by a plea, and by an answer, in support of the plea, a demurrer
should be filed.
A question in this case is made, whether the plea is not multifarious, and, consequently, bad ?
The rules which govern a special plea at law, are substantially
the same as apply to a plea in Chancery. It must be single, and
not double. Its office is, to bring forward a fact, which may be the
result of a combination of circumstances; and which, if true, bars
the relief prayed for in the bill. 15 Ves. 377. A plea, in order to
be good, must be either an allegation or a denial of some leading
fact, or of matters which, taken collectively, make out some general
fact, which is a complete defence. Story's Eq. Pl. 497. 4 Sim. Rep.
161. 7 Johns. Ch. 214. Beames' Pl. in Eq. 10. But, although a
defence offered by way of plea should consist of a great variety of circqmstances,yet, if they all tend to a single point, the plea may be good.
Thus, a plea of title derived from the person under whom the plaintff claims, may be a good plea, though consisting of a great variety
of circumstances; for the title is a single point, to which the cause is
reduced by the plea. So a plea of conveyance, fine, and non claim,
would be good, as amounting to one title. Cooper's Eq. Pl. 225.

(The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

Beames' Pl. in Eq.: 18. Mit. Eq. Pl. 296, The result of all the
authorities is,,that Various facts may be pleaded if they conduce to
a single point, onwhich the defendant means to rest his defence.'
And by this rule the plea in this case must be tested.
The defendant pleads in bar to the right asserted in the bill, the
establishment of the Woodward and Saffrey station, as the place
where the contested boundary line is to commence, and from which
it was in fact run. And to support this, the agreements of 1710 and
1718 -are relied on, and also the unmolested possession according to
the same.
These agreements, and the unmolested possession accordin to
them, are facts and circumstances which conduce to prove the right
or title asserted in the plea. They are consistent with each other;
and can in no correct sense be considered as tending to establish'
distinctive grounds of title.
The two agreements are substantially the same; and the unmolested possession, according to the agreements, is a consequence
which naturally follows, and tends very strongly to confirm them.
The important fact asserted in the plea is, that the"cobtroversy
was amicably adjusted between the parties by the establishment of
the line; and there s not a fact or circumstance averred in the plea,
which does not go to support this main fact. This plea then cannot
be tnultifarious. The point relied on is single and distinct, although
it isestablished by a variety of facts and circumstances.
Mere surplusage will not render a plea multifarious, or double.
Beames' P1. in Eq. 19, 20. In Story's Eq. P1. n. 3, it is remarked,
what constitutes duplicity or multifariousness in a plea, is sometimes
a matter of great nicety upon the footing of authority. A plea cannot contain two distinct matters of defenco; for, if more than one
defence be admitted, it is well observed, there may. be as many
grounds of defence stated in a plea as in an answer; and this would
defeat the object of the plea.
Where in a bill praying a conveyance for four estates, the defendant put in a plea of a fine as to one estate, and in the same plea, he
put in a disclaimer as to the other estates, the plea was overruled;
for the disclaimer was wholly disconnected with the plea of the fine,
and the plea was therefore double. Facts inconsistent with each
other cannot be pleaded, for this would set up two defences. But
where tho facts, however numerous, all conduce to establish one
point, as in the plea under consideration, it is not multifarious.
Story's Eq. P1. 499.
This plea goes to the whole bill, and the matter in bar is clearly
and distinctly averred. These averments must be sufficient to support
the plea, and exclude intendments against the pleader. 2 Ves. 245.
2 Sch. and Lef. 727. 18 Ves. 182.
The defendant has filed an answer in support cf his plea, and this
is necessary where there are equitable circumstances stated in the
bill, in favour of the plaintiff's case, against the matter pleaded.
These allegations in the bill must be denied by way of answer, as

well as by averments in the plea. 6 Ves. 594. 2 Ves. and B. 364.
In such case, the answer must be full and cear, or it will not be
effectual to support the plea ; for the Court will intend the matters
so charged against the p[eader,:unless they are fully and clearly denied. But if they are, in substance, fully and clearly denied, it may
be suficient to support the' plea; although all the circumstances
charged in the bill may not be prec;sely answered. Mit. 298, 299.
2 Atk. 241. 1 Sim, and Stu. 568. 5 Bro. Pl. Ch. 561.
The answer goes to the whole bill, and it denies all fraud, misrepresentation, or unfairness; and every allegation in the bill which
goes to 'show that the agreements set forth in the plea should not
be binding and conclusive on the parties.
A question is made, whether this answer, which goes to the whole
bill, and denies the same facts as are denied in the plea, does not
overrule the plea.
This objection seems to derive some support from certain decisions
made in the Exchequer, and which have been, somewhat loosely,
copied into some of the elementary treatises on Chancery pleading.
But these decisions have never been sanctioned by the High Court
of Chancery in England; whose rules of practice havebeen adopted
by this Court.
The rule is, that the answer must not be broader than the plea;
but must, in support of the plea, deny fraud and all equitable circumstances alleged in the bill, which are also by a general averment
denied by the plea.
.The answer, when filed in support of the plea, forms no part of
the defence. It is evidence which the plaintiff has a right to require,
and to use to invalidate the defence made by the plea. 6 Ves. 597.
In a note in Mit.'240, it is said, "that in the cases in the Court of
Exchequer, it seems to have been supposed that the answer in support of the plea overruled the plea. But an answer can only overrule a plea where it applies to matter which the defendant, by his
plea, declines to answer; demanding the judgment of the Court
whether. by reason of the matter stated in the plea, he ought to be
compelled to answer so much of' the bill."
.If the plea goes only to a part of the bill, and prays the judgment
of the Court whether he shall be compelled to answer the other
part; and the answer goes to the whole bill, the answer being
broader than the plea, overrules it. For the answer is to the part
of the bill which it is the object of the plea not to answer.
As this plea extends to the 'whole bill, it is essential to its validity
that such facts should be averred in it as shall make a complete
defence. But it is not necessary in the plea to notice every allegation in the bill which does not involve the facts that constitute
the bar.
Where the plea does not cover the whole bill, as where it only
sets upon a matter in bar to a part of the relief sought in the bill,
the other part of the bill must be answered. In the case under con-

272

SUPREME COURT
[The. State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.J

sideration, the answer in support of the plea is not broader than the
plea, and consequenily does not overrule it.
I come now to examine the great question in the case; and that
is, whether the matter in bar, set out in the plea, constitutes a good
defence to the bill..
In entering upon this subject, it may not be improper to notice
the hardship complained of by the plaintiff's counsel, in setting up
the defence by a special plea.
It is said that the ground assumed is narrow and technical, and
excludes the full merits of the controversy from being examined.
That no opportunity is afforded .the plaintiff to prove the mistake
by the commissioners, in agreeing to Woodward and Saffrey's 'station as the place where the boundary line was to begin; and which
is the main ground on which the bill prays for relief.
' It is true, a plea somewhat narrows the ground of controversy.
Whilst it must contain all the facts material to a complete defence,
it need not be extended to all the allegations of the bill. And the
plaintiff may either take issue on the plea, or admit the truth of it,
by setting it down for hearing; as has been done in this case.
The office of a plea is to reduce the cause to a single point, and
thus prevent the Etxpense and trouble of an examination at large.
But the matters stated in the bill, which are not denied.by the plea,
are admitted to be true. The case of the plaintiff then, as now to
be considered, is 'as full and as strong as it is presented in the bill,
where not denied by the plea. The averments of the plea are ad-m
mitted to be true; and the question is, whether those averments,
counteracted by any allegations in the bill, not denied by the plea,
constitute a bar to the right asserted by the plaintiff.
*The plea states that in the year 1642, Woodward and Saffrey
erected a station or monument at a point then taken, and believed
to be on the true and real boundary of Massachusetts, on the south.
And that in 1710, this station was agreed to be the true boundary,
and the place from which the line should be run, by Dudley and
Jenckes, commissioners appointed by. Massachusetts and Rhode
Island; and who were authorized to settle and establish the line.
And that afterwards, in the year 1718, other commissioners were
appointed by .Massachusetts and Rhode Island, to whom ample
powers were given to compromise and settle forever the boundary;
and who established the same place of beginning, And that the
report made to Rhode Island by its commissioners, setting forth the
agreement, was accepted by its legislature, and duly recorded and
ratified.
And the plea avers, that the Massachusetts commissioners, were
guilty of no fraud or misrepresentation; and that both agreements
were entered into with perfect fairness, and in good faith; and with
full and equal knowledge by the parties. That the claims of the
plaintiff, as set forth in the bill, were fully heard, discussed, and settled. And that Massachusetts has retained possession and exercised

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

273

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

jurisdiction over the country north of the line thus established, until
the present time.
These are the facts, substantially, on which the defendant relies,
as a bar to the plaintiff's bill.
The principal ground of relief alleged in the bill is, the mistake in
fixing the place from which the line was to run more than seven
miles south of Charles river; whereasby the charter of Massachusetts, it was to be but three miles south of that river.
By the charter, the boundary was declared to be "three English
miles south of any or every part of Charles river."
Some doubt may arise from this phraseology, whether the three
English miles are to be measured from the source of the southern
branches of Charles river, or from the main channel of the river.
And it would seem, from the establishment of the Woodward and
Saflrey station, and other acts done in reference to this boundary
shortly after the date of the charter, and when its language was at
least as well understood as at present, that the measurement was
understood not to be required from the body of the river. At that
early day the country was a 'wilderness, and the land was of but
little value; so that'Massachusetts -;ould have felt no; very strong
interest in establishing the line 'farther south than was authorizedby the charter.
Th6 bill alleges a mistake in this distance from the river, of the
Woodward and Saffrey station by, the commissioners of Rhode
Island, in both of the agreements respecting the boundary; and this
mistake is not denied by the plea. But, in the language of the
plea, these agreements are now to be considered as having been
fairly ma. , in good faith, without fraud or misrepresentation by
the Massachusetts commissioners; and with ah equal and full knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the case. And the inquiry
is, whether a mistake committed under such circumstances affords
on which to set aside the agreements.
ground
a sufficient
"Iwill first
consider
the priniciples of this case; as they would
apply to a controversy between individuals respecting a common
boundary.
The mistake of a fact, unless it operates as a surprise or fraud on
the ignorant party, affords no ground for relief in Chancery. 1 Story's Eq. 160. 2 Ball and Beatt. 179, 180. 4 Bro. Ch. Rep. 158.
6 Ves. 24.

The ground of relief in such cases is, not the mistake or ignorance
of material facts alone, but the unconscientious advantage taken of
the party by the concealment of them. For if the parties act fairly,
and it is not a case where one is bound to communicate the facts to
the other, upon the ground of confidence or otherwise; the Court
will not interfere. 1 Story's Eq. 160. 9 Ves. 275.
It is essential, in order to set aside such a transaction, not only
that an advantage should be taken, but it must arise from some obligation in the party to make the liscoTery; not an obligation in

b. 1, ch. 3, 4, note n.
Equity will not relieve where the means of infa'mation are open
to both parties; and where each is presumed to exercise his own
judgment. 2 Wheat. 178. 195. Where an agreement for the com.
position of a cause is fairly made between parties with their eyes
open, and rightly informed, a Court of Equity will not overhaul it;
though there has been a great mistake in the exercise of judgment.
1 Ves. 408. 1 Story's Eq. 163.
In like manner, where the fact is equally unknown to both parties; or where each has equal and adequate means of information;
or where the fact is doubtful from its own nature ; in every such
case, if the parties have actebwith entire good faith, a Court of
Equity will not interpose. For in such cases, the equity is deemed
equal between the -parties; and when it is so, a Court of Equity
will not interfere. 1 Pow. on Con. 200, ' 1 Madd. Ch. Pr. 62-64.
1 Story's Eq. 163.
The principles recognised by these authorities, apply in all their
force and conclusiveness to the case under consideration. A
greater number of authorities might be cited, but it cannot be necessary. The principles stated are founded on reason and the
fitness of things; and they have been sanctioned by a uniform
course-of adjudication.
If these rules are t6 be respected, and the mistake alleged in the
bill had occurred under precisely the same circumstances between
indi-viduals, it would seem to be clear, that there would be no
ground for relief.
A controversy exists between individuais respecting a common,
boundary. - One party claims that the line should begin at a certain
point, and the other at a different one. Arbitrators are appointed,
with full po--.-rs to settle and compromise the dispute, who establish
the point as claimed by one of the parties. Some dissatisfaction
is subsequently manifested by th& unsuccessful party; and seven
years after the first reference, a second one is made to other persons, who are vested with ample powers to settle and compromise
the controversy; and they do settle it in exact conformity to the
first award; and this second award is reported to the principals, who sanction it. In addition to this, the line or place of beginning established by the arbitrators, is the place claimed by the
successful party, as his line, more than seventy-five years before
the second award; and more than twenty years before the other
party had any interest in the boundary. And the conduct of the
arbitrators is free from any imputation of fraud or unfairness; all
having equal and full knowledge of the matter in dispute, which
was fully and fairly discussed and understood, and finally determined.
A case under these circumstances between individuals, to say
nothing of the lapse of time and acquiescence, since the award,

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

275

[The Statf of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.3

would rlot seem to be very strongly recommended to the equitable
int-,'position of the Court, on the ground that the arbitrators mistook a fact: a mistake not induced by the Qpposite party, or by
misrepresentation, but into which the arbitrators of the unsuccessful party had innoently fallen, having as full a knowledge of.
the whole merits of the case as the arbitrators chosen by the other
party.t
Relief, which should set aside the award, and open up the controversy, under such circumstances, would create a new head of
equity.
The mistake is admitted, because it is not denied by the plea;
and this may be said to be a technical advantage of the plaintiff.
For if the fact of mistake were to be tested by the circumstances
of the case, it would be difficult to come to the conclusion that a
mistake had. really occurred. If it were admitted to have taken
place, in the first award, it would require no small degree of credulity to believe, that it again occurred in the second award, made
seven years after the first one; and after much dissatisfaction haA
been manifested against the first award. This dissatisfaction could
only have arisen, from the supposed fact that the boundary had
been established too far south.
But as the case is now considered, the mistake alleged is admitted ;, but admitted-under all the averments of the plea.
If the Woodward and Saffrey station be as many miles south of
Charles river, as alleged in the bill,; it would seem to be a more reasonable supposition that it was agreed to, under a construction of
the charter, or on the principles of compromise; than through mistake. But the mistake being admitted, still, as between individuals,
there would be no sufficient ground for the interposition of a Court
of Equity.
And if relief could not be given between individuals, can it be
decreed under the same circumstances as between sovereign states.
There are equitable considerations, which would seem to apply with
greater force to controversies between individuals, than to those
which arise between states. Among states, there is a higher agency,
greater deliberation, and a more imposing form of procedure, in the
Ajustment of differences, than takes place between private individuals. Between the former, from the nature of the prodeeding,
mistakes of fact seldonj occur; and when they do happen, it is
rather a quest!)n of policy than of right, whether they shall be
corrected.
I am inclined to think with the counsel on both sides, that the
great question in this case should not be decided by the rules for the
settlement of private rights.
The high litigant parties, and the nature of the controversy, give
an elevation and dignity to the cause which can never belong to
differences between individuals. It may be a simple matter to determine where a line shall be run ; but when such determination
may draw after it a change of sovereign power over a district of

276

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

country, and many thousand citizens, the principles involved must
be considered as of the highest magnitude. The question is national
in its character; and it is fit and proper that it should be decided by
those broad and liberal principles which constitute the code of
national law.

Vattel, in his treatise, 277, says, "When sovereigns cannot agree
about their pretensions, and are nevertheless desirous of preserving
or restoring peace, they sometimes submit the decision of their disputes. to arbitrators, chosen by common agreement. When once the

contending parties have entered. into articles of arbitration, they are
bound to abide by the sentence of the arbitrators: they have engaged to do this; and the faith of treaties should be religiously
observed."
And again: "In'order to obviate all difficulty, and cut off every
pretext 9f which fraud might make a handle, it is necessary that the
arbitration articles should precisely specify the subject in dispute,
the respective and opposite pretensions of the parties, the demands
of the. one and the objections of the other. These' constitute the
whole of what is submitted to the decision of the arbitrators; and it
is upon these points alone that the parties promise to abide by their
judgment, If, then, their sentence be confined within these precise
bounds, the disputants must acquiesce in it. They cannot say that
it is manifestly unjust; since it is pronounced on a question which
'they have themselves rendered doubtful by the discordance of their
claims, and which has been referred, as such, to the decision of the
arbitrators. Before they can pretend to evade such a sentence, they
should prove, by incontestable facts, that it was the offspring of cri-uption or flagrant partiality."
And again, in page 178, he says, "Arbitration is a very reasonable mode, and one that is perfectly conformable to the law of
nations, fdr the decision of every dispute which does not directly
interest the safety of the nation. Though the claim of justice may
be mistaken by the arbitrators, it is still more to be feared that it
will be overpowered in an appeal to the sword."
The author well
observes, that the Helvetic republic, by a wise adherence to this
mode of adjusting controversies among themselves, and with foreign
countries, has secured its liberty, and made itself respectable throughout Europe.
These principles have been established by the common consent of
the civilized world.. And where they are invoked in the settlement
of disputes betweer' states, and the proceeding is characterized by
fairness and good faith, it ought not to be set aside, and indeed cannot be; without, in the language of Vattel, proving by the clearest
evidence that the award was the offspring of corruption or flagrant
partiality. And if the determination of the arbitrators has the sanction of time as well as of principle, it is believed that history affords
no instance where it has not been considered as absolutely binding
on the parties. The peace of nations, and the prosperity of mankind, require that compacts thus formed should be held sacred.

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

277

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

The pretensions of Massachusetts in favour of the line as established by both arbitrations, commenced in',1642; and no other jurisdiction had been, at any time, exercised over the country north of
this line. It was claimed before Rhode Island had a political existence. The elements of which it was afterwards composed, were,
at the time this right was first asserted, mingled with the parent
colony of Massachusetts, and with other communities and nations.
And after they'became embodied and organized under the: charter
of 1663, it was nearly half a century before there seems to have
been any dispute respecting this boundary.
Nearly two centuries have elapsed since the claim of Massachusetts to this line was set up, and more than a hundred and twenty
years since the controversy was settled by the commissioners or
arbitrators chosen by the parties; and, as averred in the plea, specially sanctioned and confirmed by Rhode Island.
Is time to have no influence in this case, on the agreements of the
parties ? It covers with its peaceful-mantle stale disputes between
individuals. And so strong- is its influence, that fraud, which
vitiates all human transactions, cannot be reached when covered by
great lapse of time.
Has a treaty ever been set aside on the ground of mistake'? Has
it ever been contended, that after its ratification by the high contracting parties, either could look behind the treaty and object to it,
because the negotiators had mistaken a fact? It is believed that
such a pretension would be new in the history of diplomacy. The
treaty must speak for itself; and under its provisions must the rights
of the parties be ascertained.
In the first treaty of limits between this country and Great Britain; it is a.fact not now questioned; that a mistake of many miles
was made in establishing our northern boundary. But this has
afforded to Great Britain no occasion. of remonstrance or complaint.
Our own government, on a recent occasion, declined an acquiescence in the decision of the King of the Netherlands, in relation
to this same boundary. But, in his letterof July 21st, 1832, to the
representative of Great Britain in this country, the Secretary of State
says, in relation to the resolution of the Senate against the decision;
that it.was adopted under the conviction that the arbiter had not
decided the question submitted to him, or had decided it in a manner not authorized by the submission."
"It is not," he adds, "the intention of the undersigned to enter
into ap investigation of the argument which has led to this conclusion. The decision of the Senate precludes it,- and the object of this
communication renders it unnecessary; but it may be proper to add,
that no question could have arisen as to the validity of the decision,
had the sovereign arbiter determined on and designated any boundary as that which was intended by the treaty of 1783."
This view, by the Secretary, of the binding effect of the decision
if it had been made on the point submitted to the arbiter, is in acVoL. XIV.-2 A

cordance with the principles of national law, and has a direct and
most forcible application to the case under consideration.
No objection is made by Rhode Island that the arbitrators exceeded their powers. No such objection can be made. Their
powers were ample; and their proceeding a both in 1710, and in
1718, seem to have been qharacterized by'great dignity and deliberation.
The complainant, it is true, was dissatisfied with the first decision, establishing Woodward and Saffrey's station; and by remonstrances induced the appointment of the second commission in 1717,
which in the following year confirmed, in all respects, the first decision. Notwithstanding these remonstrances against the first decision, it would seem from the bill, that until 1749, the complainant
believed that Woodward and Saffrey's station was only three English miles south of Charles river; and was consequently the true
point from which the line should be run. This being the case, as
the 'bill does not stdte the precise ground of dissatisfaction at the
first report, it cannot well be imagined.
Rhode Island, it seems, from time to time, by remonstrances, in
the form of resolutions and otherwise, and by the appointment of
6ommissioners, signified its dissatisfaction at the boundary, as established in 1710 and 1718. Massachusetts, as it was bound in comity
to
do, appointed
listenp4 to these expressions by Rhode Island; and more than
once
commissioners on the, subject. But whether
we
look to the averments in the plea, or to the statements in the bill, the
defendant never seems to have done any thing which could impair
the force of the agreements.
The bill states various facts, such as- the little value of the land
bounding on the disputed line for many years, the sparseness of the
population, the want of means, and the intervention of war; as reasons why Rhode Island did not bring this controversy before the
king in council, under the colonial government.
It appears from the exhibits accompanying the bill, that, in 1740,
there being a dispute between Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
whether the former could exercise its jurisdiction to the shores of
the Narraganset bay,, the King of Great Britain appointed commissioners to settle the controversy, who decided against Massachusetts.
This decision was confirmed on an appeal from the commissioners,
by the king and council.
So long as the colonial government continued, this mode of redress,
so successfully invoked by the complainant in the above instance,
remained open. The articles of confederation formed by the new
government, made special provision for the settlement of disputed
boundaries between states. And when these were revoked by the
adoption of the Constitution, the tribunal at last appealed to was
opc1p and has ever remained ready to hear and decide the controversy.
Giving full weight to-all the allegations in the bill, which go to

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

279

[The State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

excuse the delays of Rhode Island in asserting its claim, it is still
difficult to say .that the claim remains unaffected by the unmolested
possession of Massachusetts, according to the agreements. Rhode
Island, it is true, is small in territory, and weak in numerical force,
but it has always stood high in moral power, and intellectual endowment; and the tribunals which, since the commencement of the controversy, have been open to hear its complaint, have been tribunals
of reason, of justice, and of established law.
The arguments of the counsel for the complainant, zealous and
able as they were, rested mainly on the hardship and injustice of
deciding this controversy on the pleadings as they now stand. The
mistake is admitted; and what is there else in the bill, taken in con-'
nection with all the facts and circumstances, which can give the case
of the complainant a more imposing form. No fraud is imputed ;
the sealed agreements, now and ever, must speak the same language;
the effect of time will remain; and the excuses alleged in the bill for
delay, can scarcely have, under any form of pleading, greater effect
than may be given to them'as the case now stands. I speak.not of
the volume of evidence which may be thrown into thecase by a
change of the pleadings; but of the leading and indisputable facts
which must, under any form of procedure, have a controlling influence in the decision. Believing, as I do, that in admitting the truth
of the plea, Rhode Island has done nothing prejudicial to her interests; and that in the present attitude of the case, its substantial
merits are before us, I feel bound to pronounce a different opinion
from that which has been given by a majority of my brother judges,
Taking the facts of the plea, and giving due weight to all the allegations of the bill, not denied by the plea, I am led to the conclusion
that the bar is complete. In coming to this conclusion, I feel no
want of respect for the state of Rhode Island, which has become so
illustrious in our history by its enterprise, its intelligence, and its patriotism.
Mr. Justice CATRON.

The facts and pleadings have been so fully stated by my brethren,
as to require from me only a brief notice of the conclusions my
mind has come to on the points in controversy.
The defence, in the form of an incongruous plea, must set up matter ift bar, which, if true, renders immaterial every other fact alleged
in the bill ; be these as they may, the defence must be conclusive of
the controversy ; and every necessary averment to sustain the matter pleaded in bar, must also be made in an answer covering the
plea, which cannot be permitted to stand unsupported by an answer. This is the familiar and settled practice of the High Court
of Chancery in England; and adopted by rule in the Courts of the
United States.
In form, it is believed, the plea and answer in this cause are aacurate in a high degree, in regard to the matter pleaded, and the

.280

SUPREME COURT.
[The State of hode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

averments necessary to give it effect, in the sense it is relied on as a
bar; unless the defence set up is double.
It is insisted the plea is multifarious, because it relies on two defences: first, the compacts ; and second, the possession and occupation of the territory claimed.by the plaintiff, for more than a century.
The facts pleaded must be conducive to a single point of defence;
and the question is, 'are the compacts, the making of the line in part
execution of them, and the taking and holding possession in other part,
and complete' execution of them, combined facts and circumstances,
conducing to establish the single point relied on in defence? That
is, that the line run from Woodward and Saffrey's station was the
true boundary, established by, ind marked in execution, of, the compacts; and. that by the compacts Rhode Island is estopped to deny
its validity. And I think the circumstances pleaded are so connected
as not to vitiate the plea.

If it is bad, it must therefore be so on its merits involving the
obligatory" force of the compacts. That they are prima facie conclusive of the bundary, is admitted: but the bill alleges they were
made in misthke, and the line run and marked, and possession surrendered to Massachusetts, in mistake of a prominent fact: that
Rhode Island then believed the station, and the line run from it,
three miles south of Charles river; wnereas subsequent observation
and examination had ascertained it to be much further south, that
is, about seven miles.
The Massachusetts charter calls for a line to be drawn east and
west, "three miles south of the waters of said Charles river; or'of
any, or of every part thereof;" and' the plea, in substance, avers,
the charter was construed, and the line settled by the compacts,
without misrepresentation on the part of Massachusetts; and with
full and equal knowledge of all circumstances by both parties.
The plea having been set down for argument, without an issue,
must for the present be taken as true; and the averments taken as
admitted, that'the parties entered into the compacts, and established
the boupdary, with fall and equal knowledge of all the circurnstances 'f law aiid fact-involved in the controversy, as it then
existed, and now exists. And in the face of -the compacts thus
made, can Rhode Island be heard to allege the existence of a mistake in the boundary established by them; and marked by the
mutual commissioners, and as the joint act of both parties ? Under
the circumstances, to open the controversy, and let in proof of a
mistake ; at this day, to overthrow a solemn treaty made between
two independent governments;. is deemed by me, inadmissible, not
to saydangerous. And I think the matters pleaded (if true) a good
defence. If this compromise and solemn establishment of a boundary, made a century ago, can be impeached on the ground of a mistake, so palpable and easy of detection; cannot every other made
bythe states be-brought before this Court, on a similar assumption,
usually much better founded; especially where degrees of latitude

JANUARY TERM, 1840.

281

[The .State of Rhode Island vs. The State of Massachusetts.]

are called for as boundaries? If the parties, "with full and equal
knowledge of all circumstances," compromised and settled a doubtful construction of the Massachusetts charter, and in which they
were engaged nearly ten years; why should this Court go further
into the matter, at the hazard of encouraging litigation in so many
other .quarters ?
I will for th present refrain from entering into the inquiry, how
far such a mistake of law; in construing a private instrument, could
be inquired into by a Court of Chancery in a suit between man apd
man; nor what help the' mistr ke of law (if any exists) could derive from the facts apparent by the bill, unless the statement of the
proposition should suggest the answer.
Nor will I attempt to draw the marked line of distinction between such private agreement, and a public treaty, by state with
state; in regard to the difficulty of going into matters of mistake,
usually not predicable of a treaty.
On consideration of the plea filed in this case by the defendant,
and of the arguments of counsel thereupon had, as well in support
of as against the said plea,'it is now here ordered by this Court,
that the said plea be, and the same is hereby overruled; and it is
further now here ordered by this Court, that the defendant answer
the bill of complaint, as amended, on or before the first day of the
next term.
