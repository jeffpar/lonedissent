From the sentence of condemniation by the district

new evidence being admitted, the sentence was reversed

United States appealed to this court, where witnesses
were examined viva voce, both on the part 9 f the Ulnited
States and on that of the claimant.
C. Lee, for the claimant, stated that he should contend,
1. That the proceedings ought to have been according to the course of the common laii, and the facos
ought to have been tried by a jury.

He wished, however, to be heard, upon the question of
pitting the claimant to answer upon .oatb, and was indulged.
He observed that this was not a proceeding in personam, but in rem. The United States did not bring
in the claimant by process, and compel him to answer
upon oatn, as is done in chancery cases; but the claimant comes in voluntarily to support his interest, and
submits to the jurisdiction of the court. He ought to
come with cleau hands and a- pure heart. If this be a case
of admiralty jurisdiction, the proceedings must be according to the course of the civil law, where the practice universally has been to try cases without a jury.

Yonese.- It is objected that it does not appear upon Taz UIITED
the face of the libel that the -seizure was made upon "
.
waters navigable from the sea by vessels of ten abd more B
cv
.
tons burthen. But it is stated in the libel that the yes- \.y'%./
sel was more than ten tons burthen," that the seizure
was made in the port of Alexandria, and that the vessel
had sailed from that port to the West-Indies, and back
to Alexandria, fioin whence it necessarily follows, that
the waters of the port of Alekandria are navigable from
the sea by vessels of ten and more tons burthen. Besides, this court is bound to take notice of the ports of
entry for foreign vessels established by law; and the
port of Alexandria is one of those ports.
In the case of The Vengeance, the court officially
took notice that the bay of Sandy-Hook contained waters navigable, &c.
If the jurisdiction appears by necessary inference
from what is stated, it is sufficient.
C. Lee, contra.
By the 3d article of the constitution of the United
-States, the judicial power of the United States is extended " to all caseiof admiralty andraaritimdjuridiction." Congress could not make cases of admiralty
and maritimejurisdiction ; and under that clause of the
constitution they could not give their cdurts jurisdiction
of a case which was not of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction at the time of the adoption of that constitur
tion. The question, then, is, whether, according to
the understanding 6f the people of this country at that
time, a seizure ef a vessel, within the body of a county, for breach of a municipal law of trades was a case
of admiralty cognizance.
It certainly was never so
considered in England, from whence/we draw all our
ideas of admiralty jurisdiction. All seizures in that
country for violation of the laws of revenue, trade, or
navigation are tried by a jury in the court of exchequer
according to the course of the common law. There is
nothing in the course of proceedings in ren which requires that they should be in a court of admiralty. A

Nor were such cases ever supposed by the people of
this country to be rightfully classed among causes of
admiralty. It was'one of our serious grievances, and
of which we complained against Great Britain in our
remonstranecs to the King, and in our addresses to the
people of Great Britain,' while we were colonies, that
the jurisdiction of the courts of vice-admiralty was
extended to cases of revenue. Yournals of the old Cohgress, vol. 1. p. 47. Such being the understanding of
.the people of this country at theoad6ption of the constitution, we are to presume that the words " cases of admiralty and maritimejurisdiction,"did not include cases
of seizure like the present. The 9th section of the judiciary act (vol. 1. p. 53.) is to be construed with a reference to the meaning of tlfose expressions in the constitution ; and if it cannot, consistently with the'force
of its terms, be reconciled with the constituti6n, it
must yield to the superior obligation of that instrument.
The words of that se'ction .of the act, as far as they affect the present question, are, " and shall also have exclusive original cognizance of all civil 'causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, including all sei;zures
underlaws of impost, navigation, or trade, of the United States, where the seizures are'made on waters which
are navigable from the sea by. vessels of ten or more
tons burthen, within their respective districts as well as
upon the high seas : saving to suiters, in all cases, the
right of a cominon law remedy, where the common law
is competent to give it * and shall also have exclusive
original cognizance of all seizures on land, or other
waters than as aforesaid, made, arid of all suits for
penalties and forfeitures incurred under the laws of the
Unitec'States." " And the trial of issues in fact in the

FEBRUARY, 1808.

449

district courts, in all causes, except civil causes of ad- TnaUU.TrD
STATES
miralty and maritime jurisdiction, shall be by jury."
V.
BE
PTSE'Y, &C

The ,word "including,!' means onjy, moreover, or,

au well as.
The district court shall have exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction, including, within its exclusive original
cognizance, all seizures, &c. It does not mean incltding within the expression " all civil causes of admiralty,". &c. If such cases of seizure were civil causes of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, there was no necessity to enumerate them, because the expression, all
civil causes of admiralty, &c. cirtainly iticluded them.
If they were not civil causes of admiralty and maritime
jurisdictioi, congress could not make them such, nor
by forcing them into that class, deprive the citizen of
his right to a trial by jury. Congress had no such intention, -for inthe very same breath they say, "saving
to suiters, in all cases, the right of a common law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it."
We have seen that in all cases of seizure for breaches
of the lawi of revenue, trade or navigation, the common law is competent to give a remedy; and consequently this suiter is entitled to it.
T~e several acts 6f congress creating forfeitures for
breaches of the laws of revenue, &c. all seem to refer
to the"exchequer practice, rather than to that of the admiralty.
In the act for registering vessels, passed the 31st of
-December, 1792, (Oswald's edition of the Acts of Congress, vol. 2. p. 134. 144. sect. 4. and 16.) if the owner shall take a false oath, " there shall be a forfeiture of
the vessel, &c. or of the value thereof, to'be recovered
with costs of suit," of the person taking the false oath.
So in case of the sale of a vessel to a foreigner it shall
be forfeited in a certain case, "provided that if it shall
be made appear to the jury before whom the trial for
such forfeiture shall be had, that," &c. and the penalties and forfeitures, under that act were' to "be sued
for, prssecuted and recovered," in such courts. &c

450

tion of duties, &c. - Hence it is evident that congress
V.
3ETsEY, &C.

intended that all cases of forfeiture should be tried by
jury. The expressions in the act respecting registering of vessels, explain what may otherwise appear
doubtful in the act concerning the collection of duties,
as to the mode of prosecution.
So in the act suspending intercourse with France, vol.
1. p. 245. offending vessels are made liable to be seized,
" and may be prosecuted and condemnid in any circuit
or district court of'the United States, which shall be
holden within or for the'district where the seizure shall
be made."
But by the judiciary act no circuit court could take
original cognizance of civil causes of admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction; hence it is obvious that congress
did not consider such seizures as civil causes of admiraltv, &c. The forfeiture also is to accrue to any person"" who will inform and prosecute for the same,"
which shows that the proceedings were to be at common law.
All the forfeitures under the act for the collection 9f
duties, are to be recovered in the same way. Some of
them being cases of seizure on land, must be tried by
jury, therefore all must. And in sect. 71. (vol. 4. p.
391.) it is said, " in actions, suits or informations' to.
be brought, where any seizure shall be made 'pursuant
to this act, if the property be claimed by any person, in
every such case the onus probandi shall be upon such
claimant." These expressions all indicate proceedings
at common law only.
The 89th sect. in p. 427. spedking of the recovery
of penalties, clearly refers to silits at commoi law;
and when speaking of forfeitufes, it says, "and all
ships, goods, &c. which shall becomhe forfeited in virtue of this act, shall be seized, libelled and proseculed
as aforesaid;" referring to the mode of prosecution
pointed out for the recovery of penalties. Here if the
word " libelled" had not been used there could be no
doubt. But the expression '4 libelled" relates as well to

RFEBRUARY, 180S.
seizureson land, as to seizures on water; but seizures
on land must be tried by jury according to the course
of the common law. The word libel therefore does not
refer exclusively to admiralty proceedings.
The Excise Law, vol. 1. p. 313. makes no distinction
between ieizures made at land, and those made on
water.
By the 5th amendment to the constitution, no person
shall be deprived of property, without due process of
law; which means by due process of the comzon

law.
By the 7th amendment, in suits at common law the
right of trial by jury shall be preserved, i. e. continued
as it then was. At that time all municipal seizures
were triable at common law.
,The act prohibiting the intercourse with bt. Domingo
differs from that under which the Vengeance was prose-

cuted.
There the mode of prosecution was declared to be
the same as for penalties and forfeitures under the act
for collecting duties ; but here no mode of prosecution
is prescribed.
The act creates two offences.
.1. Sailing to St. Domingo without being destined for
that island.
2. Being destined and sailing for a prohibited port
without arriving there. The offence of destination is
an offence on land and to be tried by the course of the
common law. Hence also it may be inferred that the
other offence is to be tried in the same manner. No
difference is made by the statute.
The act requires bonds to be given which are forfeited if the*offence has been committed. Suits at common
law upon these bonds are now pending. If these had
been tried first .he facts must have been decided by a

jury, and by the 7th amendment of the constitution,
" no fact tried by a jury, shall he otherwise ie-examin-

. ed in any court of the United States than according to
rules of the common law." The consequence would
have been that this case,. involving the same fact, between the same parties, could not have been otherwise
tried than by a jury. It could not have been the intention of congress that in one case the same fact should
be decided by the judge, and in the other IRy a jury.
Sthe

The case of the Sally was decided upon the authority
of that of the.Vengeance, without argument; and is
therefore of no authority.
Rodney, -Attorney-General, in reply, was stopped by
the court as to the lay of the case.
MARSHALL, Ch. J. The court considers the law as
completely settled by the case of the Vengeance. A
distinction has been attempted to be drawn between
this case and that, but the court cqn see no difference.
It is the place of seizure, and not the place of committing the offence, which decides the jurisdiction.

It has been said the word " including" ;means Moreover, or as well as ; but if this was the meaning of the.
legislature it was a very embarrassing mode of expressing the idea. It is clear that congress meant to discriminate between seizures on waters navigable from
the sea, and seizures upon land or upon waters not navigable ; and to class the former among the civil causes
of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.
The only doubt which could arise would be upon the
clause of the constitution respecting the trial by jury.
But the case of the Vengeance settles that point.
The sentence of the circuit court was reversed, and
that of the diitrict court affirmed.
