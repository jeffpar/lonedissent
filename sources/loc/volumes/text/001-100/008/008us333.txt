the defendants did not pay the 170,000 guilders on the

damages for failing to comply with the agreement ; and

If then we show that on thd 13th of May the United
States were not entitled under the contract to more than
170,000 guilders, they canot recover in this action.
The'object of the United States was to have the money paid in Amsterdam. The 20 per cent wa the stipulatedi damages for not paying ihe money in that place.
By referring to the law rEspecting bills of exchange, the
parties meant to be governed by that law; and by stipulating for interest in a certain event only, they are to
be understood'as not claiming it in any other case. By
the law of Pen__sylvania respecting foreign bills of exchange drawn in that state, and returned under protest,
the principal sum is to be re-paid in Pennsylvania,with 20
per cent advahte thereon. If the priacipal sum cannot
be claimed, the'advance thereon cannot be claimed. It
is an incident to the principal, and cannot be demanded
without the principal. If a bill be protested for nonpayment, but the acceptor afterwards pay it, and the
holder receives the money in the place where it ought
to be paid. he -cannot afterwards come upon the drawer
for damages, re-exchange, &c. By receiving the mo-ey he waives the objection to the tine of payment. The
20 per cent damages are the price of the risk, trouble
and expense of transportation of the money. If the defendants have actually transported the money, and the
plaintiffs have received it at the place appointed, theyare
not entitled to be repaid the expense of the transportation; and to charge the defendants wth that expense
now, would be to charge them twice.
The meaning of the agreement is, that if the United
States are obliged to receive their money in this country,
they shall receive the twenty per cent advance thereon ;
if, therefore, they have no right to demand re'payment
of the-money in .this country, they have no right to
the 20 per cent. After having received the principal
sum in Amsterdam, they clearly have no right to demand payment of it here. By the non-payment at the

their ri'ghtto repayment of the money in America. But
they did not, and'actually receiyed the iioney'in Holland, before any*demand on the defendants in Ameiica.
The liquidated damages can be reiovered only in the
case specified by the parties in their contract ; and this
is upon demand of payment in America, of the value
of the sum remaining unpaid in Europe at the time of
the demand. The condition'of the bond is " to re-pay
to the United States the value of the said 500,000 guilders, at the rate of exchange current in Philadelphia at
the time demand of payment, is made, together with
damages at the rtite of' 20 per cent," &c. The dmages
could only be demanded, and were only to be paid,
" together-with" the principal. If the plaintiffs had no
right to demand payment of the.principal, they had no
right to demand payment of the damages. By the
terms of the cohtract, interest could only be demanded
from the time of demand of re-payment on behalf, of the
United States, the United States having a right to demand such re-paymen'
. Advance" and "Iint'erest ' are relative terms ; they
must refer to a principalsum. If there be no principal
sum due, there can be no advance nor interest thereon.
The liquidated damages were the damages for the
entire breach of the contiact on the part of the defendants, in failing to pay altogether in Amsterdam; not
for a mere delay of payment for a few days. According to the construction which the United States contend
for, they would be entitled to 20 per cent damages, even
if they had received the 170,000 guilders on the second
of March. Such a construction would make the contract .highly penal, and therefore "isto be avoided, if
possible. "Doug. 504.

The rule upon demurrers is to go bnck to the first
fault. If our replication is bad, their plea is bad also.
The defendants could only plead payment at or before
the day. This is not a bond within the statute of Anne,
the pkyment of which after the day may be pieaded. It
is a bond fo perform covenants.
But if payment after the, day might be pletided

Th question is, whether on the whole record the
,HERs. United States are entitled to recover.

The contract
is, that the parties should stand in the
Irelation
of drawers
and payees of a bill of exchange.
The contract was made it Philadelphia, and must be
governed by the laws of Pennsylvania ; and under those
laws the 20 per cent.canfiot be'recovered until the bill
be returned. If the defeiidants had drawn a bill pay,
able on the 1st of March, and it had then been protested, but afterwards, on the 13th of May, taken up by
the accepior, it could - never have been returned by the
payees ; and consequently, the 20 per cent damages
could not have been recovered.
It was not necessary for the defendants to aver in
their plea that Willink and Van Staphorst'had authority
to receive the money; it is averred by the plen, and
adnqitted by the replication, that the money was paid by
the .defendants to Willink and Van Staphorst, bankeils of
the UnitedStates, to and for the use of the United States.
It is therefore admitted to be a payment to the United
States as much as if it had been so expressed.
.Ifno interest was due on the 13th of May, it "was
not necessary in the plea to aver payment of interest.

The bond is virtually for payment of g sum less than
the- penalty'; and therefore within the statute which
authorises aplea of payment after the day.
It was not necessary to plead that it was received in
satisfaction. That is afact for the consideration of the
jury 9n the plea of payment. The demurrer does not
admit the fact that it was not received in s,.tisfaction,
,for'the demurrer admits nothing but what'is well pleaded ; and to a plea of payment it is a bad replication to
say that the money wag not, received in -satisfaction.

MARSHALL, Ch.
as follows, viz..

J. delivered the opinion of the court

This case comes on upon a special demurrer to a replication filed by the plaintiffs to a plea of payment after
the day. The replication is doubte, and consequently
ill. But it is a known rule that a demurrer brings all
the pleadings before the court; in consequence of which,
judgment must be rendered against him who has committed the first fault; or, which will most generally produce the same result, for him who upon the whole record
shall appear to be entitled to their judgment. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the plea of the defendants. By their agreement with the secretary of the
treasury, they were bound to pay to the bankers of the
United States in Amsterdam the ium
of 500,000 guilders in the following manner, viz. 230,000 guilders on
or before the first day of rebruary, 170,000 guilders on
or before the first day of March, and the remaining
100,000 guilders on or before the first .day of June, in
the year 1803. The first payment was made oni the
day, and the last before the day, but the second payment
was made on the thirteenth day of May, instead of the
first day of March. On the effect of this payment, the
whole case depends.
The defendants plead that they did, on the 13th day
of May, at Amsterdam, pay to the bankers of the United States, for the use of the United States, the sum
of 170,000 guilders. The replication admits this payment as pleaded, but denies that it was accepted, received and allowed by the United States in payment
and satisfaction of the same sum which was payable on
the first of March. The replication proceeds to aver
that the said sum of 170,000 guilders was not paid on
the first day of March, nor had the defendants paid the
damages of 20 per cent which were stipulated, in case
of failure to pay on the day.
The fact upon these pleadings appears to be, that the
payment was received by the United States without any

stipulation respecting the effect of that receipt, upon
their agreement with the defendants. If payment to
the bankers of the United States, the persons to whom

by agreement the money was to be paid, was not payment to the United States, it would not be a payment
to the use of the United States, which the plea avers,
and the replication in terms admits. In such case thc
replication, instead of averring that thiV sum was not
accepted in satisfaction of the same sum payable at an
earlier-day, would have averred, and ought to have
averred, that it was not accepted at all,. and was not a,
payment to' the use of the'United States, inwhich case,
instead of a special'replication, issue might have been
tenderied on the plea. The court, then, understands
the fact as stated in the pleadings to be, that the
money was'received without any agreement whatever,
and the law must determine the effect of such a payment.
The payment made to tli& bankers in Amsterdam
being then an actual payment to the United States, the
inquiry is, whether it was such a payment, and is so
pleaded, -as to bar this action.
It is admitted that the sti'tute of Anne, which allows
payment after the day to he pleaded, is in force ihPennsylvani., but it is cbntended that Ithis bond is not within that statute ; or, if it is, that this plea is-not good
under it.
-If this be' a bond within the statute of Anne, on which
the tourt give's no opinion, yet by that statute, the payment must be of the whole sum actually due,, or the
action for the penalty is not barred.
In this case the sum due on the first of March was
paid on the 13th of May, without interest or ddmages.
. By the United Stgies it is conlended, that daniages
at the rate of 20 per -centum on the sum of 170,000
guilders Were then due ; by the defendants it is contende.d( that no inferest was due.

The words of the contract to which each party refers, TB,;zUzTzD
are not precisely the same in the condition of the bond StT1s
and in the articles-of agreement which are referred to Guiv
.,-Z
by the bond. There is no contradiction between them;
oTaBUZ.
but there is a variance in this, that the condition of the
bond expresses more fully than the articles the idea of
the parties, that in case of failure to perform the contract
at Amsterdam" the demand for p'avmdnt was to be made
in Philadelphia. The words of the condition are, "or
in case'the said sums shall not be paid is aforesaid, then
to repay to the United States the value of. the said
500,000 guilders, at the rate of exchange current in
Philadelphia at the time demand of payment is made,
together with damages at the rate of 20 per cent, in the
same manner as if bills of exchange had been drawn for
the said sum, and they had been returned protested f6r
non-payment, and lawful interest for any delay of payment that may take place after the demand."
The defendants were merchants residing and carrying on trade in-Philadelphia, in which place the contract
was made, and by the law of the state, bills of exchange
returned unpaid under protest are liable to 20 per cent
damages. ' Itis sufficiently obvious, from these circumstances, and from ihe words of the condition, that the
parties contemplated a repayment in Philadelphia in the
event of non-payment in Amsterdam.
it iz contended by the plaintiffs that, the instant the
failure to pay the 170,000 guilders on the first of March
had taken place, a full and complete right to the sxipuiated damages .was vested in the United States, witho.utany further act oA their part ; and thata payment of the
principal sum on the succeeding day lvquld not have r lieved the defendants from.those damages.

In this opinion the court does not concur with the
counsel for the United States.
Cdntracts are always to be construed with a view to
the real intention of the parties. In this contract, the
object of the.United States was to remit to their bankers
in Amsterdam a sum of money, for which they had

as a compensation for the disappointments produced by
the non-payment of the money at that place in such ime
as to answer the purposes of the contract. -Whether
payment at the same place on a subsequent day would
answer these purposes, was for the United States to
determine. They might accept it, or they might reject it, and claim whatever the -law of their contract
would give them.- In the event of non-payment in
Amsterdam at the time stipulated, the defendants are to
repay-to the United States the value of the guilders
they shall have failed to pay in Anisierdam, "at the rate
of exchange current in Philadelphia at the time demand
of payment is made; together with damages at the rate
of 20 per cent." The thir interpretation of this agreement is, that the demand is to be made in Philadelphia,
that the money is to be repaid in-Philadelphia, and that
,the damages are upon the money there to be repaid.
Had a~part of the sum of 170,000 guilders been paid on
the first of March, it will scarcely be contended chat
damages would have accrued on that part. A repaymentof it could not have been demandable in Philadelphia. It appears to the court that the acceptance of any
part of the sum due in Amsterdam on a subsequent
day, is a waiver of the claim to damages in Philadelphia on the sum so arrp r.'-r , for that sum cannot be
demanded in Philadelphia.
This reasoning, to winch the majority of the court
would strongly incline, from the nature and circum-.
stances of the contract, derives much additlonal force
from the reference to bills of exchange. The, repayment of the value of the guilders " at the rate of exchange current in Philadelphia at the time demand of
payment is made, together with damages at the rate of
20 per cent," is to be .made " in the same manner as if
bills of exchange had been drawn for the said-sum, and
they had been returned protested for non-payment. '
Why is this reference made to bills of exchange ?

FEBRUARY, 1808.

The stipulation that damages at the rate of 20 -per T11zU.TTZV
STATZ
centur should be incurred on those sums which the
, A' W
defendants might fail to pay at the time and place mentioned in their contract, did not require it, unless the oTuns.
law of bills of exchange was eithei to explain or to give
validity to that stipulation. To a majority of the court
it is satisfactory evidence that the parties intended this
contract; if not as a complete substitute for bills of exchange, to operate between themselves as if bills had
been drawn. The law of Pennsylvania regulating bills
of exchange was -well understood. If those drawn on
any part of Europe are returned back unpaid With a
legal protest, the drawers and indorsers are subjected to
damageskt. the rate of 20 per centum. But the right
to these damages is not complete until the bill be returned back under protest. Till then they are not. demandable. Consequently, payment befoie the hill returns
does away the right to demand them. By receiving
payment, the holder waives his right to damages. The
express reference to bills which is made in this contract,
and 'the terms in which that reference is made, being
considered by the majority of the court as explanatory
of the intention, of the parties that the right to damages
should-be put on the saume footing as if billshad been:
drawn, form an additional reason for their opinion that
aft acceptance in Amsterdam after the ay, before a
demand in. Philadelphia, amounts to a waiver of any
right the United States might otherwise, perhaps, have
had to demand the stipulated damages.
But whether.the sum agreed to be paid as a compensation for a failure to pay at the titne and .place.mentioned in the contract, be considered merely as a penalty, or as stipulated damages, of which the law swill
coerce the payment, a *forfeituretook place on the nonperformance of the condition of the bond, and a right
to something more tfian that condition vested immediately in the obligees. If the reservation of damages
in the condition of the bond is in law only a double
penalty, then interest is the legal compensation for this
breach of the covenant contained in the condition of the
bond. If it be even of the character given to it by
'"both parties in argument, the amount ot damages settied by he parties themselves, the majority of the court

those stipulated damages might reifistate. The majority'of the cou , therefore, is of opinion, that under
th6 circumstances which have taken place, the United
Stites ought to receive, under this contract, interest on
the" sijm of 170,000 guilders, from the first of March,
the day on, which that sum ought to have been paid,
until the thirteenth of May, the day on which it was
.actually paid. Judgment, therefore, on the pleadings,
must be rendered for the plaintiffs.
By the 26th section Qf the judicial act, it is directed,
that in cases of this description the court shall render
"judgment for so much as is due according to equity.
And when the sum for which judgment should be rendered is uncertnin, the same shall, if either of the parties request it, be assessed by a jury."
In this case it is the opinion of the majority of the
court, thatjudgmqnt ought to be rendered for so much
as remains due of ihe sum of 170,000 guilders, calculating interest thereon from the first of March in the
year 1803, and if either of theparties request it, that a
jury be impanelled to qscertain the value of this sum in
the money of the United States.
