PLAINTIFFS

IN

ERROR

V.

HENRY

FRANKLIN AND WIFE.
Under the laws of Louisiana, and the decisions of the courts of that state, a mark
for the name, to an instrument, by a porson who is unable to write his name, is
of the same effect as a signature of the name.
A bill of sale of'slaves and furniture, reciting that the full consideration for the
property transferred, had been received, and which does not contain any stipulations or obligations of the party to whom it is giveii, is not a cynalagmatic contract, under the laws of Louisiana; -and the law does not require that such a bill
of sale shall have been made in aif many originals as there 'were parties having a
direct interest in it, or that it should have been signed by the 'vendee.
Evidence will be legal, as rebutting testimony; as to repel an imputation or charge
of fraud; wh. ih would -not be admissible as original evidence.

IN error to the district court of the United States, for East
Louisiana.
The defendants in error, Henry Franklin and wife, on the 23d of
January, 1836, presented a petition to the district court of the'United
States, for the eastern district of Louisiana, for the recovery of certain slaves, with their children, and also of certain stock and household furniture; which the petition alleged had been gold to him by
Joseph Milah, by a bill of sale, duly recorded in the proper notarial
office. The bill of sale was in the following words:
State of Louisiana, Parishof St. Helena.
Know all men,to whom these presents may come, that I, Joseph
Milah, have this day bargained, sold, and delivered unto Henry
Franklin, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, six negroes,
namely: One negro woman, named Neemy; one boy, do. John;
one do. Sam; one do. Nels; one negro girl, named Ha r'iet; one do.
Jenny; together with all of my cattle, hogs, horses, household and
kitchen furniture, for the sum of twenty-eight hundred dollars, to
me in hand paid; which property I do warrant and defend from me,
my heirs, executors, and, assigns, to him, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, forever.

Joseph Milah died in July, 1834; and the petition 'claimed that
the plaintiffs were entitled to the negroes, with their children, and
the other property mentioned in the bill of sale; which, at the time
of bringing the suit, were in the possession of the defendants; who
held and detained them, and have refused to deliver them to the
petitioners.
On the fifth day of February, 1836,, John and Letitia Zacharie
answered the petition, admitting they were in the possession of the
negroes mentioned in the petition;,,and they aver that Letitia Zacharie is- in such possession, in her capacity of tutrix of her minor children; Who are the lawful proprietors of them by inheritance, from
their father, Joseph Milab. They deny that the bill of sale was ever
signed by Joseph Mi.ah; and, if signed by him, it was done in error,

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

153

[Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.]

and through false and fraudulent representations of the plaintiff, and
no consideration was given for the same; and the same was fictitious
and collusive, and intended to cover or conceal a disguised donation
of the slaves mentioned in the same; and was therefore null and
void. The defendants asked for a trial by a jury. Afterwards, by
a supplemental answer, the defendants say, that, at 'the time of the
alleged sale, under private signature, Joseph Milah had neither children or descendants actually living; and, since the same, the chilaren
of which Letitia Zacharie is the tutrix, have been born, and are now
living.
On the trial, there was given in evidence by the plaintiffs, among
other documents, an instrument executed in South Carolina, Richland
district, by Joseph Milah, on the Ilth day of July, 18,05; by which
Joseph Milah, under his hand and seal, gave a negro wench and a
negro boy, and also his personal property, to Sarah M'Guire. This
deed was regularly acknowledged; and was recorded in the Richland district, in South Carolina, on the 10th December, 1805.
The cause was tried by a jury, and a verdict was rendered for th6
plaintiffs; on which the Court gave a judgment. The defendant
took two bills of exceptions.
The first bill of exceptions was in the following terms:
On the trial of this cause, the plaintiff offered in evidence an instrument in writing to his petition annexed, and bearing date the 17th
July, 1819, and purporting to be executed by Joseph Milah by the
affixing of his mark; and offered to prove same by the evidence of
William M'Miclrael and Joseph Ott, whose signatures are affixed as
subscribing witnesses, which instrument is made part of this bill of
exceptions: the defendants objected to the introduction of said instrument and testimony on the ground, 1st, that being an instrument purporting to convey slaves, the same was null and void as not
having been signed by the vendor; and that no parol proof could be
admitted to prove its execution. 2. That a mark is not a signature
within theprovision of the laws of Louisiana, in relation to the conveyance of slaves. 3. That the instrument, containing a synalagmatic contract or mutual and reciprocal obligation, not being in the
form of an authentic act, was invalid, because not made in as many
originals as there were parties having a direct interest. 4. That the
same was not signed by the vendee. But the court overruled the
objections.
The second bill of exceptions was taken to the admission in eviVOL. XII.-U

SUPREME COURT.
. [Zacharie et-al. v. Franklin et-al.]

dence 6f the instrument executed in Richland district, South Carolina, as a gift or donation of two slaves and certain personal property.
1. Because the plaintiffs in their petition claim to have a title to
the slaves referred to in their -petitibn by, virtue of a bill of sale to
Henry Franklin, one of the-plaintiffs, under date of the 17th July,
,1819; and that they cannot offer evidence to establish title from any
other source than that therein stated.
2. Because there is no evidence of the identity of the
person by
whom this instrument purports to have been executed, with James
Milah, under whom plaintiffs claim; nor of the slaves named in the
petition.
The defendants also moved for a new trial, on reasons fiAled;,which
motion was overruled by the Court.
The defendants prosecuted 'this writ of error.
The case was. submitted to the Court by Mr. Benton and Mr.
Preston, on printed arguments. Mr. Benton read the arguments
for the plaintiffs in error; and for the defendants.
The argument for the plaintiffs in error, was as follows:
The court, in overruling the motion for a new trial, sums up the
evidence; and shows clearly the nature of the case, as established by
the facts.
The judge states that it was proved on the trial, that the writing
sued upon was executed when Joseph Milah was supposed to be on
his deathbed. Then it was made mortis causa, and was intended to
be a will, or to have the same. effect. It contains the disposal of his
negroes and furniture. The subscribing witnesses do not prove any
money paid; andwe know the man was not trafficking in negroes
and furniture, for money, on his deathbed. He was making a donation, mortis causa; and, as' the judge correctly concludes, was disposing of his half of the community of acquests that had existed between him and his deceased wife, ir favour oC her sister; as he might
do by the laws of Louisiana, having no chil, ;en. But by the laws
of Louisiana then in force, as well as by the present code, "no disposition, causa mortis, could be made otherwise than by last will;
all other form is abrogated;" Civil Code of 1808, p. 226, ch. 6, see.
1, art. 81: and being a nuncupative testament, under private signature, should'have been attested by five witnesses residing in the
parish, and accompanied by many formalities, all detailed at page

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

155

[Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.]

22.8 of the code; which are not pretended as to the act of 1819, sued
on. All these formalities were essential to its validity, as well as
that it should have been probated and ordered to execution. Same
Code, p. 242, arts. 153,.157. The effect of a will, by the verdict and
judgment, is given to the instrument; and yet it was utterly null
and void as a will.
But, as a will, it transferred only one-fifth, (though the judge
thought one-half, from not adverting to the laws of inheritance,) of
Milah's half of the property to the legatee, donee or. vendee, by
whatever-name she is called. The other four-fifths belonged to Joseph
Milah's two children, and forced heirs; of which he could not deprive them by will. Civil Code of 1808, page 212, articles 19 and 22.
And yet, strange to think, the judge justifies the jury in giviug the
other four-fifths, or half, as he supposes, to the plaintiffs, on the
ground of damages, in which he concurs; although there is no claim
for 'damages in the petition; and although, if proved, (though he
states it was merely argued,) it would not support a verdict, and
judgment for title. The ground on which he supports the verdict for
the other half of the slaves, is, that not the plaintiff and vendee in
the title sued upon, but his wife inherited that from her deceased sister. The existence of all these facts, which were, offered in- support
of the verdict, were inconsistent with it, and with the action; and
clearly showed that the verdict was contrary to law.
This evidence, and these considerations, were undoubtedly offered
in lieu of a consideration for the bill of sale, that is, in place of the
two thousand eight hundred dollars; but if so, then the sale was
simulated, and not real, as plead; but a disguised donation or testament, and therefore null, not being made according to law.
The judge farther states, that it appeared that the act was made to
avoid the expense of settling Milah's estate in the court of probates.
This was not the consideration expressed, but an illegal. consideration; and one that ceased as soon as Milah recovered. For these
-easons the act was null; Civil Code, article 1887; anal remained a
recorded nullity; and peculiarly so, after the subsequent birth of
Milah's children. Old Code, page 224, article 74. Until now, fraudulently revived after his death, when orphans are left to contest that
which, from shame, would not have been presented, had he been
alive.
But the judge charged the jury, and the counsel'of the plaintiffs
now argued for the same thing, that, regarding the instrument sued,

SUPREME COURT.
[Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.]

on as a donation, although, by the Old Civil Code, page 224, article
74, the law in force at the time, it was revoked by the subsequent
birth of children; yet a subsequent law, article 1556 of the New
Code, made the donation revocable oi'ly; and the last law is to govern
the case. Then, in a donation upon coidition, the legislature can
dissolve the condition without the consent of the donor. It is only
necessary to state the proposition to have it rejected; and to induce
this high tribunal to instruct the inferior tribunal, to instruct the jury
more properly. But the article 1556 of the New Code, revokes the
donation up to the disposable portion; which, in the present case,
there being two legitimate children contending for their inheritance,
is one-half of the estate. New Code, 1480. The donation is not revocable, but revoked to that extent.
These reasons of the judge, the parol testimony adverted to, the
written testimony on file, the pleadings, exceptions, and grounds for
a new trial; all show conclusively, that the private act of 17th July,
1819, was not a real transfer of slaves for two thousand eight hundred dollars, in hand paid; and, therefore, the verdict declaring it so,
was contrary to law and evidence: and the neyv trial should have
been granted by the inferior court, and must be granted by this
Court. Indeed, the whole proceeding shows such confusion in the
minds of the court and jury, as to what they were trying; that sub-,
stantial justice requires that the case should be remanded for another
trial. They revived an old donation and will, that were dead letters;
converted the act of sale sued on, into a will, though against the very
letter of our law; and yet administered the laws of inheritance, and
act of testament upon Milah's succession;. and, in doing so, made a
medley of the laws of Louisiana and South Carolina: and still could
not deprive the children of the last fourth of their paternal inheritance, without taking an account in equity of the rents and' profits of
the slaves, and enforcing it by trespass on the case for damages.
The admission of the act sued upon in evidence was opposed; and
being admitted, exception was taken thereto. It isliable to three legal objections:
1. It was not recorded in the office of the parish judge of St.
Helena, where it was made, and where the parties lived. The law
of Louisiana, in force at the time, declared "That no notarial act
concerning immoveable property, (and slaves were immoveable property,) shall have any effect againstthird persons, until the same shall
have been recorded in the office of the parish judge, where such. im-

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.]

moveable property is situated." See 3d Martin's Digest of the Laws
of Louisiana, page 140. Mrs. Milah and her children are, as to this
transaction, third persons as to Milah ; because she married him, believing him the owner of the slaves in his possession, and there was
no recorded outstanding title.
2. The contract was synalagmatic. Milah was bound to keep the
slaves, that they might be delivered at his death; and Franklin to
grant the enjoyment to Milah during life, and even to pay the price,
if it had not in reality been paid. Yet it was not made in two originals, which the law, in force at the time, positively required, on
pain of nullity; it being a writing under priv ate signature. Old Code
of Louisiana.
3. The mark of Milah is made to the instrument, and not his signature. This objection rests upon our peculiar law, which declares
"That all sales of immoveable property, or slaves, shall be made by
authentic act, or under private signature." A verbal sale of any of
these things shall be null, as well for third persons, as for the contracting parties themselves; and the testimonial proof of it shall not
be admitted. Civil- Code, article 2415. And in defining acts under
private signature, our code declares; that it is not necessary that thobe
acts be written by the contracting parties, provided they be signed
by them. Article 2238. It is thought, under uniform decisions in
France, upon a similar article, that the words signature, and signed, do
not embrace a mark; and this interpretation is the more reasonable,
as it is so easy to have the contracts of persons who cannot' sign,
made before a notary; and it is so- important with regard to the inmoveable property, and the slaves of a country.
Exception was also taken to the intrpduction in evidence, by the
plaintiffs, of a title to part of the slaves, and from which the others
descended, dated in Richland district, state of South Carolina, on the
11th day of July, 1805. , The objection is based upon the universal
rule, that the evidence in a cause must correspond with the allegations. 1st Starkie on Evidence, 386; 8 Martin's Rep. 400; 3 Martin's New Series, 509. The plaintiffs set up no such title in their
petition. It is true, the judge states he admitted it only as rebutting
testimony to the parol evidence as to fraud; especially as evidence
had been given of a previous disposition of the property. The idea of
the judge is not very clear; but it is very clear that a title has been
admitted in evidence, against which the defendants had no opportunity to prepare to defend themselves; and that much more than a re-

SUPREME COURT.
[Zacharie et.al. v. Franklin et al.]

butting effect was given to it, since, in the charge to the jury, and in
overruling the motion for a new trial; .as appears by the judge's reasoIP it was constantly stated, that although. a donation of slaves is
not absolutely, but only contingently, 'translative of property in
Louisiana; yet, by the laws of South Carojina, he had an absolute
right to donate the whole of his slaves.
For all which reasons, the plaintiffs in error pray that the judgment may be reversed, and the cause remanded to be tried again.
For the defendants in error, in the printed argument of Mr. Preston, it was said:
The plaintiffs below, Franklin and wife, sue to recover from the
defendants below, but who are plaintiffs in error, certain slaves, with
their increase, in-a bill of sale mentioned in, and' annexed to their petition. The defendants, Zacharie and wife, disclaim title in themselves, but set it up for the children of the wife, as heirs of one Milah.
They answer that they do not know if Milah, their ancestor, ever
made the bill of sale; and, if he did, that it Was simulated, arid intended to cover a disguised donation; and that thisdonation became
null and void, by the subsequent birth of the children of Milah.
The first question presented by the bill of exceptions 'ofthe defendants, is,as to ,the admissibility of,the bill of sale of the slaves
from Milah, in evidence. The execution cf it by Milah, by affixing
his mark thereto, he not being able to write, was proved by the subscribing witnesses; and the court admitted it to go to the jury4x
The denial of the executio i of the bill' of sale of the slaves, by
Milab, must be considered as w-ived,,by the subsequent and inconsistent plea, that it became null and void, by the birth of children.
See'Arnold v. Bureau, 7 Martin's Reports, 291; Nagel v. Mignot,
8 Martin's Reports, 493-4. But if, notwithstanding the inconsistency of the pleas, it was necessary to prove the execution of the biP
of sale, it has been sufficiently done by proving, by the subscribing
witnesses, that Milah affixed his mark thereto. For a sous seing
prive act of sale, with the mark of the vendor, is sufficient. It is
not requisite that he should sign his name, to make it valid. This
question, which has been raised in Louisiana by quotations from
French. writers, has received a judicial decision, since the trial of
this case, from the supreme court of the state of Louisiana. Tagiasco
et al. v. Molinaris heirs, 9 Louisiana Reports, p. 512. "The force
and effect to be given to instruments, which have for signatures only

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

159

[Zacharie et al. v: Franklin et al.]

the ordinary marks of the pkarties to them, depend more upon rules
of evidence, than the dicta of law, relating to the validity of contracts-required to be made in writing."
"The genuineness of instruments under private signature, depends
on proof; and, in all cases, when they are established by legal evidence, instruments signed by the ordinary mark of a person incapable of writing his name, ought to be held as written evidence."
"The rules of evidence by which courts of justice have been
governed in this state, since the change of government, have been
borrowed, in a great part, from the English law, as having a more
solid foundation in reason and common sense."
"According to.the rules of evidence, as adopted in thisstate, the
ordinary mark of a party to a contract, places the evidence of it ona footing with all private instruments in writing." This case has
since been confirmed by that of Madison -v. Zabriskie, (1 Louisiana
Rep. p. 251.

The next question is raised by the exception taken to the charge
of the court to the jury. The judge charged the jury that a donation, under the form of an onerous contract, is not void; and in this
he is supported by the decisions of the supreme court of Louisiana.
Trahan v. M'Manus, 2 La. Rep. 209; Homes et al. v. Patterson, 5
Martin's Rep. 693.

The defendants required the judge to charge, that, by the article
74, page 224, of the old civil code of the territory of Orleans, a
donation became absolutely void by the subsequent birth of children; and it was in force' and to. 'govern in this case. This he refused, because that code was repealed by the act of the legislature of
the state of Louisiana, 12th March, 1828, page 66. And the present
code of Louisiana, article 1556, enacted in 1825, revokes donations
only up to a certain extent, and under certain circumstances; and
this last article, 1556,.of the Louisiana code, should apply,. because
the children were born subsequent to its enactment. There is, then,
nothing. erroneous in the charge of the judge, nor in the admission
of evidence; and the judgment should be affirmed.
The defendants below, present two other points of objection to tlie
legality of the judge's decision, in the court below. First, for admitting the plaintiffs to give, in evidence, a deed of gift for the same
property to plaintiff's wife, in the year 1805; and, secondly, for admitting a testamentary bequest of the same property, in favour of
plaintiff and wife,*in 1834, to be given in evidence: it being argued '

SUPREME COURT.
[Zacharie et a]. v. Franklin et al.]

that this title by gift, was 'setting up a different title from the one
declared on; and that the will, making the bequest, was not duly
executed: but the judge overruled the objections, and admitted the
evidence, not as titles, but to rebut the plea of a fraudulent conveyance; and to show that Milah was uniform in his determination, from
1805 to 1834, to pass this property, after his death, to the sister of
his first wife, with whom he received this property, and who died
childless: that sister and her' husband being now the claimants of the
property, against the children of a second marriage.
Mr. Justice RAaRBouR delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case is bi,"ght into this Court, by a writ of error, to the
district court of the United States,. for the eastern district of
Louisiana.
It was a suit commenced by the defendant in error, for himself
and wife, by a petition, according to the Louisiana practice, for the
recovery of several slaves, (with their increase,) and other property,
consisting of stock of several kinds, and household and kitchdn furniture; which he alleged had been sold to him, by a certain Joseph
Milab, by a bill of sale, duly recorded in the proper notarial office;
of which bill of sale, p'ofert is made in the petition, and which is in
the following words, viz: "Know all men, to whom these presents
may come, that I, Joseph Milah, have this day bargained, sold and
delivered unto Henry Franklin, hig heirs, executors, administrators
and assigns, six negroes, (naming them;) together with all of my'
cattle, hogs, horses, household and kitchen furniture, for the sum of
twenty-eight hundred dollars, to me :in hand paid;, which property,
I do warrant and defend," &c. Signed Joseph Milab, with his
mark. To which was added the following condition, viz: "The
condition of the above bill of 'sale is -such, that the aboyementior~ed
property remain in my possession so long as. live; ind, after my
body is consigned to the grave, to remain, as abovementioned, in the
above bill of sale." The defendants, Zacharie and wife, filed their
answer, denying all. the allegations in the petition, except as thpy
thereinafter specially admitted. They then proceed to state, that
the female defendant was in possession of the negroes referred to in
the petition; that she possessed them in her capacity of tutrix of
her minor children, John and Josiah, whom she avers to be the lawfuLproprietors thereof, by a just title, to wit, by inheritance from
their father, Joseph Milah; they denied that the writing attached to

JANUARY TERM, 1838,

161

[Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.)

the plaintiff's petition, was ever signed or executed by Milah, and
required strict proof thereof; they alleged that, if it ever were so
signed and executed, it was done in error, and through the false and
fraudulent representations, of the plaintiff; and that no consideration
was ever given or received therefor: that, if it ever were signed or
executed by Milah, it was fictitious and collusive, intended to cover
or conceal a disguised donation of the slaves therein mentioned; and
that as such, it was null and void, not having been made with the
formalities required by law; and they prayed for a trial by jury.
The defendants' afterwards 'filed a supplemental,
answer, stating
that, at the time when the alleged sale, under private signature, purported to have been executed, Milah had neither children nor descendants actually living; and that legitimate children of said Milah
were afterwards born, and were then living.
A verdict and judgment were rendered in favour of the plaintiff..
At the trial, one bill of exceptions was taken by the plaintiff, and
two by the defendant. As.the judgment was in plaintiff's favour, it
is unnecessary to consider the exception taken by him: wetherefore
pass, at once, to the consideration of those taken by the defendant,
now plaintiffs in error.
The first of these was taken to the admission in evidence .of the
bill of sale, of which profert was made in the petition, upon several
grounds which amounted in substance to this; that the instrument,
being one which purported to convey slaves, was null and void, because it was not signed by the vendor; a mark not being, as alleged,
a signature within the provision of'the laws bf Louisiana, in relation
to slaves; and that no parol proof could be admitted to prove its execution. And that the instrument being one which contained mutual
and reciprocal obligatiohs, and not being-in the form of an authentic
act, was, invalid; because not made in as many originals, as there
were parties having a direct interest, and not signed by the vendee.
No adjudged case is produced by the counsel for the plaintiffs in
error, in support of the first branch of the objection, that the instrument has the mark, and not the signature of Milah. It is rested on
a provision of the law of. Louisiana, which declares, "that all sales
of immoveable property, or slaves, shall be made by authentic act,
or private signature."
Signature is indeed required' but the question is, what is a signature? If this question were necessarily to be decided by the prinerples of law, as settled in the courts of England and the-United States,
VoL. XII.-X

SUPREME COURT.
([Zacharie et al. v. Franklin et al.]

there would be no 4loubt of the truth, of the legal proposition, that
making a mark is signing, even in the attestation of a last will and
testament; which has been fenced around by the law with more than
ordinary guards, because they are generally made by parties, when
they aresick, and when too they are frequently inopes consilii, and
when they therefore need all the protection which the law can afford
to them. This principle is fully settled by many cases, amongst
others, 8 Vesey, 185, 504; 17 Vesey, 459. See also 5 John. 144.
But the questipn has been directly adjudicated in Louisiana. In
.9 Louisiana Rep. 512, it is said "that the force and effect to be given
to instruments, which have for signatures only the ordinary marks
of the parties to them, depend more upon the rules of evidence than
the dicta of law relating to the validity of contracts required to be
made in writing. The genuineness of instru~ments under private
signature, depend!s on proof; ind in all cases where they are established by legal evidence, instruments signed by the ordinary mark
of, a person incapable of writing his name, ought to be held as written evidence. According tor the rules 'of evidence as adopted in
this state, the ordinary mark of a party to a contract, places the evidence of it on a footing with all private instruments in writing."
To the same point see the case of Madison v. Zabriskie, 11 Louisiana
Rep. 251. This branch then of the objection to the admission of
the instrument in evidence, is wholly untenable. Nor is the other
branch of the objection to its. admissibility better supported; as the
first branch fails, as we have seen, for the want of law to support it;
so this second branch fails for want of the fact, the assumed existence
of which is the only basis on which it rests. That is, it is not in the
language of the law, a cynalagmatic contract; or in" other words, it
does not contain mutual and reciprocal obligations; to which description of contracts only, does the objection at all apply.
All the words in the instrument, as well in its body as in the condition, are the words of the maker of the instrument, the vendor.
The vendee does not sign it; he does not-speak in it*at all. Consequently, there are not, and could not be, any direct stipulations by
him, nor can any be implied from its language and provisions- ,for
the paper acknowledges on its face the receipt of the whole purchase money; and nothing whatsoever was to be done by the vendee.
The second exception taken by the defendant was, to the admission in evidence on the part of the plaintiff, of an instrument of
writing, bearing date July the 11th, 1805, in the state of South

JANUARY TERM, 1838,
[Zacharie et al. V. Franklin et al.]

Carolina; purporting to have been executed by Joseph Milah, asa
gift or donation of two slaves, and certain goods and household furniture, to one Sarah M'Guire. The court,. however, admitted the
evidence, and as we think, properly,,for the reason -assigned in the
bill of exceptions.
From that it appears, that previously to the
offering this last paper, the court had admitted evidence, on the part
of the defendant, to prove fraud and want of consideration; and they
then' admitte'd the paper thus objected to as rebutting evidence. Had
it been offered , and received by the court, as is objected by the
counsel of the defendant in error, as evidence of title, it would,
under the petition, have heen inadmissible;, upon the ground of. a
variance between the allegation and proof. But it was distinctly
received, only for the purpose of repelling the parol evidence, which
had been given to prove fraud and want of consideration; by showing
that Milah had, as early as-I8N5r manifested a disposition to give the
property to fhe plaintiff's wife, who, as appears from the record,
was the sister of the former wife of Milah, who had died without
children: the plaintiff's wife is the person named as donee, in the
deed before stated, as having been. executed by Milab, in ;South
Carolina.
When we speak of the plaintiff in this connection, we mean the
plaintiff in the court below the now defendant in error.
After the verdict was rendered, the-defendant in -the court below
moved for a new trial, for sundry reasons stated on the record, which
was refused. The granting or refusing of hew trials rests in the
sound discretion of the court-below; and is not the subject of reversal
in this Court. Without making further citations: in proof of this
proposition, it will be sufficient to refer to 4 Wheat. 220; where ;t
is said by the Court, that the first error assigned, is, that thk. Court
refused to gI'ant a new trial: but it has been already decided, and is
too plain for argument, that -sueb-a refusal affords no ground for a
writ of error. The judgment of the 'court below is vested, and is
thereforeaffimed, with costs;
:This cause carne on to. be heard on the transcript of.the record
from,the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of
Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,
it is now here adjudged and ordered by this Court, that the judgment
of the'said district court. in-this cause be, and the same is hereby

,affirmed, with costs.
