LESSEE OF GABRIEL SWAYZE, AND MARY HIS WIFE, PLAINTIFFS
IN ERROR V. ROBERT BuRKE' b. SHERMAN,

GEORG 0 JACKSON,

,ANDJAMES HINSMAN, DEFENDANTS

Ejectment. John Ormsby died in Alleghany county, Pennsylvania, in December,
1,805, having - son Oliver, who administered to his estate. He had also a son who
had married in Mississippi, and who died in 1795, leaving an infant daughter. Oli-ver Ormsby filed no inventory of the estate, of his father, and ibeer settle'd an
account as administrator; and in 1826, 4e confessed d judgment in favour of the
Messrp. Penns, for a part of the purchase nioney of a valuable real estate, which
had been held by John'Ormsby, in his lifetime. In the suit against'him for this
debt, Mr. James Ross acted as the attorney for the plaintiffs; and in 1827, the real
estate was sold under an execution issued by Mr. Ross on the judgment, and wa.q
purchased by Mr. Ross for three thousand dollars; he having, before. the purchase:
given Oliver Ormsby to understand, and having publicli declared, that he Would
hold the prQperty as a security for the debt due to the Messrs. Penns; and on the
payment of the debt, that he would relinquish all claim to it. lIt April, 1831,
Oliver Ormsby paid the debt to Mr. Ross, and took a tionveyance of the property.
At the same timne, he gave a receipt, as dministratok of John Ormsby, to the
sheriff, for the balance of the..three thousand dollarb. He 6aimed to hold the
property, so purchased, as his own. In March, 1828, Oliver Ormsby wrote to the
wife of the plaintiff in this ejectment, who was the daughter of John Ormsby,
junior, stating that his -father had not left more property than would pay his debts.
There was evidence, that less than one-tenth-of the real estate would have satisfied the judgment, for which the land was sold to Mr. joss. Mr. Ross had no.
knowledge of any fraudulent purpose of the administrator. The daughter of John
Ormsby,'juior, having intermarried with Gabriel Swayze, with her husband,
brought,'an' ejectment, to recover a moiety of the land which was held by Olivet
Ormsby, under the conveyance from Mr. Ross. The court instructed the jury, that
"in matters of fraud, courts of law and chancery have a concurrent jurisdiction.
Itis, therefore, within thp province of the jury, to inquire whether the conduct and
proceedings of Oliver Ormsby, whereby the legal title to the property in dispute,
became vested in himself, for his exclusive-use and benefit) were in fraud of his cotenant, Mary Swayze; and if they were, the verdict ought to be for the plaintitfsY.'
"That the fraud should'be brought to the knowledge of Mr. Ross; and that, if
Mr.-Ross took a valid title under the sheriff's deed, the title of his vendee would
be good, under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence." By the Court:-We
think that the judge erred, in charging the jury that the deed to Ormsby was
valid, unless they should fihia that Ross participated in the fraud.
It is clear that a purchaser at sheriff's sale, cannot protect himself against a prior
claim, of which be had no notice - or be held a bona fide purchaser, unless he shall
have paid the money.
That fraud is cognizable in a court of law, as well as in a court of equity, is a well established principle. It has often been so ruled in this court.
As there is no court of chancery under the laws of Pennbylvania, an action of eject.
ment is sustained, or an equitable title, by the courts of that state. Such is not the

SUPREME- COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]
practice in the courts of the United States; and if the plaintiffs in an ejectment,
fail to show a paramount legal title in themselves, they cannot recover.

IN error to the district court of the United States for the western
district of Pennsylvania.
The case, as stated, in the opinion of the court was as follows:
An action was instituted in the district court of the United States
for the western district of Pennsylvania, by the lessors of the plaintiffs, Gabriel Swayze and wife, citizens of the state of Mississippi; for
the recovery of a tract of land in Alleghany county, in the state of
Pennsylvania, to October sessions, 1833.
The plaintiffs and the defendants claiined the land under a deed
from John Penn, and John Penn, junior, proprietaries of Pennsylvania; the land forming part of one of the manors reserved by the
proprietaries. John Ormsby died intestate in 1791, and left a son,
named Oliver, a daughter, Sidney, who intermarried with John
Gregg; a son named John, who married and died in the state of Missippi, leaving a daughter Mary, an infantyt the time of his decease;
and'who has since intermarried with Gabriel Swayze, the plaintiff in
error. In December, 1807, Oliver Ormsby administered to the estate
of his father, John Ormsby, and gave the usual administration bonds;
but-he filed no inventory of the estate of the intestate; nor did he, at
any time, settle an account of his administration of the estate.
The estate of John Ormsby, deceased, was indebted to John Penn,
and John Penn, junior, for the land purchased from them, in the
sum of four hundred and sixty-seven dollars and sixty-four cents;
and on the 6th of September, 1826, the administrator confessed a
judgment in their favour, for the amount of the debt; upon which
judgment,.an execution was forthwith issued by Mr. Ross, their attorney, and the land of John Ormsby was levied on and sold; Mr.
Ross being the purchaser of the same, for three thousand dollars.
At the time of the purchase of the estate, Oliver Ormsby, the administrator, was absent. Mr. Ross declared, in the most public manner,
that Ormsby, the administrator, or any of the family of the deceased
John Ormsby, might redeem the.land at any time, on the payment of
the debt and interest. Before thel sale, Oliver Ormsby, the administrator, was informed by Mr. Ross, that he only wanted the money
due upon the judgment, and that he did not intend to buy the land to
hold it. Ormsby, the administrator, was in possession of the land at

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

the time of the sale, a4nd continuedin possession of it: and at the
time of the sheriff's sale, or when the deed for the land was made to
him, by the sheriff, Mr. Ross paid no money. Tile rents and profits

of the land were continued to be received by Oliver Ormsby; and in
April, 1831, he paid to James Ross, Esq. the sum of five hundred
and twenty-three dollars, the amount of the judgment, and the interest due thereon, and took from him a conveyance of the land in
fee simple; giving to the sheriff, at the same time, as administrator of
John Ormsby, a receipt for the sum of three thousand dollars, less
five hundred and twenty-three dollars, the amount of the payment to
James Ross, Esq. in satisfaction of the debt due to the Messrs. Penns.
The land consists of eighteen coal hill lots, and of thirty-five acres
of land adjoining to them, and is now of great value. It was highly
valuable at the time of the sheriff's sale. The defendants were in
possession of the property as tenants of Oliver Ormsby, when the
suit was commenced.
In March, 1828, in answer to an application for information as to
the value of the estate of John Ormsby, by Mrs. Swayze, one of the
lessors of the plaintiff, Oliver Ormsby wrote; "My father, at his death,
was not possessed of more property than a sufficiency to pay his
debts, having, from time to time, sold to individuals, and conveyed
to his children." Evidence was also given, conducing to prove, that
by a sale of two of the coal lots, the judgment could have been satisfied.
The case was tried at October term, 1835, and a verdict and iudg
ment were rendered for the defendant, ander the charge of.the
district judge. The plaintiffs excepted to the opinion of the court,
and prosecuted this writ of error.
On the trial of the cause, the counsel requested the district judge
to charge the jury, "in matters of fraud, courts of law and chancery
have a concurrent jurisdiction. It is, therefore, within the province
of the jury, to inquire whether the conduct, and proceedings of
Oliver Ormsby, whereby the legal title to the property in dispute became vested in himself, for his exclusive use and benefit, were in
fraud of the rights of his cotenant, Mary Swayze; and if they were,
the verdict ought to be for the plaintiffs."' The court gave the instruction as requested, with this qualification, that the fraud should
be brought to the knowledge of Mr. Ross ; if he took a valid title,
under the sheriff's deed, the title of his vendee would be good, under
the circumstances disclosed in theevidence.

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burkie et al.]

The argument of Mr. Fetterman, for the plaintiffs in error, and
of Mr. Watts, for the defendants, was submitted to the court in
writing, at the close of January term, 1836.
Mr. Fetterman contended, that it is now an admitted maxim at law,
that fraud is cognizable at law hs well as in equity;; and whether that
inquiry can be made in an action of ejectment, is the, question. This
court, in the case of Sayre's Lessee v. Ormsby et al. 8 Peters' S. C. R.
252, says, "it is an admitted principle, that a court of law has concuirent jurisdiction with a court of chancery in case of fraud; but when
matters alleged to be fi'audulent are investigated in a court of laiv, it
is the province of the jury to find the facts, and determine their character, under the direction of the court." It is worthy of remark,
that that was an action of ejectment.
We find, also, that as early as Fermor's case, 3 Rep. 7 1, A. the principle settled, "that fraud vitiates all transactions;" so in 10 John. 462,
Jackson ex dem. Gilbert v. Burgett, which was- an action of ejectment; Kent, chief justice, in delivering the opinion of the court, says,
"courts of law have co'ncurrent jurisdiction in all cases of fraud.
Fraud will-i'validate in a court of law as well as in a court of eqiity,
and annul every contract and conveyance connected with it; a frau-'
dulent estate is as no estate in judgment of law?' .Lord Mansfield, in
the case of Cadogan v. Kennett, Cowp. 434, says, "the principles and
intent of the common law, as now universally known and understood,
are so strong against fraud in every shape. that the common law could
'
have attained every end effectuated, by the statutes of Elizabeth: "
and the' same judge3 in Bright v. Eynon, 1 Burrows, 395, remarks,
"fiaud or covin may, in judgment of law,.. avoid every kind of act."
Courts of equity and courts of law have a-concurrentjurisdiction to
suppress and-relieve against fraud.' So judge Parsons, in Boyden v.
Hubbard, 7 Mass. 112, "but when a court of law has regularly, the
fact of fraud admitted or proved, no godd reason can be assigned why
relief shall not be obtained there." So in 18 John. 111, which was
the case of an ejectmetit in an alleged fraud in a sheriff's sale, the
samQ principle is expressly reaffirmed; also, in Fleming v. Slocum,
same book, 403-4; and in Pennsylvania, in 2 Watt's Rep. 66, Gilbert v. Hoffman, which was an action of ejectment, justice Rogers, in
delivering thee opinion of the court, reiterates the same principle: "a
covinous conveyance of land, is as po conveyance against the interest
intended to be defrauded.'.' "It is certainly not the duty of .a court

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

15

[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

an atto protect the, interest of a person who has been detected'in
tempt at fraud."
"The devisee or heir whom the vendee attempted to defraud, for
the attempt affects him as well as creditors, asks the aid of the statute
against this fraudulent conveyance, on the ground that his title cannot
be affected by a fraudulent sale. His remedy is strictly at law, for
fraud is cognizable in a court of common law, as well as in a court of
equity. A fraudulent vendee has no equity, and is not entitled to
claim the protection of law on that ground." In this case, as well as
in the cases of Ridell v. Murphy, 7 Serg. & Rawle, 230; Bownes'
Lessee v.. Craft, 8 Johnston, 118; Lazarus v. Bryson, 3 Binney, 53,
54; 5 Cowen, 67, 78; Johnston's Ferry v. Harvie, 2 Penn. Rep. 93;
,were actions of ejectment, in which the question of fraud was considered as proper matter of inquiry.
Unless, according to the opihion of the judge of the district court,
Mr. Ross is guilty of fraud, the plaintiffs cannot recover; no matter
hb w fraudulent the intentions and conduct of Oliver Ormsby may have
-been. The heir of John Ormsby cannot recover from Oliver Ormsby,
unless she proves that Mr. Ross was particeps criminis. The debt for
which the property was sold, was due at the death of John Ormsby;
its existence was known to Oliver Ormsbyf his administrator'; he
1820.1
promised to pay it in
In Pennsylyania, lands have always been assets for the payment
of debts. Graff v., Smith's Administrators, 1 Dallas, 481; Morris v.
Smith, 1 Yeates, 238. Either to an action of debt, as a cause of action, or when resort must be had to a scire facias, after. the deAth of
the debtor; it issues not against the heirs, upon whorn the law ca'sts
the inheritance.; but against the executor or administrator, who, so
far as relates to the payment of the debts, is the trustee of the real
estate. Rogers v. Rogers, 1 Hopkins' Chancery Reports, 526-7, a
case very similar to this, and in Brown v. Webb, 1 Watts' Reports,
411.:
How does it become material to show that Mr. Ross was guilty
of fraud?
It is alleged that Ormsby was guilty of an att.emrt to defraud his
co-heirs out of this property; and if he was guilty of such hOW can
his situation be either benefited or injured by the fact that Mr. Ross
was or was not equally guilty of the fraud? The law abhors all
kind of fraud, whether open or by any kind of indirection; and when
the action is against the party guilty of the fraud, or his heirs, it is

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

not for him or his heirs to shelter themselves from the consequences
of his own wicked designs. As early as Tresham's case, 9 Reports,
110, in an action against an administrator, it was resolved by the
court, on the 4th point of the case, "That although a general allegation of covin, which, as held in Talboise's case, ought to be between
two or more, would be sufficient; yet a fortiori,in case of fraud
which may be in the heart of one obly; -r if one by deed make a
fraudulent gift of his goods to divers wlo knew not of it, it is fraudulent in him who makes it. And so it wa3 adjudged in Tutner's case,
Ily: h.nd
8 Reports, 133, A. that fraud may be ifi one or one party
again, in the same case, the court say that fraud may be committed
by one alone: and in Turner's case, the court held, that although an
administrator may, lawfully confess a judgment in favour of one
*creditor, yet if that creditor afterwards'is satisfied, or offers to compromise, and offers to take sixty pounds fbi-one hundred pounds, and
.he administrators do not do it, to the intent that the judgment may
stand in force, so that third persons may be defrauded, and the administrators convert the deceased's goods to their private use, which
is altogether against their office and the trust reposed in them; and
therefore, be such agreement either precedent, before the recovery,
or subsequent after the recovery, it is all one as to the creditor, who
is a third person; for he is defrauded as well by the subsequent agreement as by the agreement pr9cedent: and in 2 John Ct. 42-3, it is
ruled that a deed, fraudulent on the part of the grantor, may be avoided. though the grantee may be a bona fide purchaser and ignorant of
the fraud.
This brings us to the important inquiry in this ease, whether
an
executor or administrator, or any other individual standing in a
fiduciary capacity, can purchase the ,real estate, either directly or
indirectly at a public sale, occasioned by his own neglect and misfeasanc., as in this, and hold the same to the exclusion of his coheirs; upon this point the booKs are full of authority. Courts both
of law and equity have -reiterated the position that it cannot be done.
The law will not thus suffer a man to be led into temptation by taking
away from him all inducement to fraud. The general principle is
strongly laid down in the able commentaries of Mr. Justice Story on
Equity, 318. The principle applies, however inconvenient to purchasers in any given case; it is poisonous in its consequences: and
the same principle is advocaied by chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, vol. 4, 438-9.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

On this, point there was also cited Wormley v. Wormley, 8 Wheat.
441; 1 Mason's C. C. R. 241, 345; Davone v. Fanning, 2 John. Chan.
Rep. 252; Lazarus v. Bryson, 3 Binney, 54; Moody v. Vandyke, 4

5 John. Chan. Rep. 439. After referring to these cases, we may appeal to the facts of this case, and confidently ask, where was the
necessity- of proving that Mr. Ross lent himself to the fraudulent intentions of Oliver Ormsby; before we can recover from trustees the
estate he and they held by fraud. It is humbly imagined, in this part
of the case, the learned judge was in error. An individual may concert a scheme of fraud, he may employ a hundred different agents,
they may each believe his intentions perfectly honest-they, as in
this case of Mr. Ross, may not know that, there were other lawful
heirs to the estate, except Ormsby and his lunatic sister, then partly
under his care-they may each believe his intention pure: and yet
we must prove them all parties and privies to the fraudulent intentions of the maker of the fraud, before we can defeat the estate so unfairly acquired. How was Mr. Ross to know whether there was
personal property to pay the debts? 1how was he to know that Mrs.
Swayze was an heir, residing in Mississippi? How was he to know
that Oliver Ormsby had been guilty of falsehood to her; that in 1828,
a year after the sheriff, sold, before a dollar was paid either by Ross
or Ormsby, that Ormsby had written to her, telling her his father had
left no property? Yet Oliver Ormsby knew all these things, and the
court say, although he was guilty of fraud, yet the plaintiffs cannot
recover, unless Mr. Ross was also guilty of it. In considering that
part of the charge of the court connected with this point, we do not
wish to scan it nicely, but to give it a fair and liberal construction;
and in doing so, must observe, that it neither correspondA with the
facts of the case, nor the- law of the land; as we understand it. It is
all true that Mr. Ross attended at the sheriff's sale, and had the property knocked off to him in the lump, "chilling by his presence the
sale," saying, "if Ormsby or any of his family can get able to redeem it, he, or any of his family, might hav. itlon paying the debt
and interest:" the very effect of a declaration of this, kind, would be
VOL. XII.-C

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke at al.]

to prevent the property from bringing its full value. Ross never interfered with Ormsby in the possession of the property-paid no
money to the sheriff, and there was no money paid until 1831, when
.Ormsby paid Ross the. amount of the judgment, and receipted to the
sheriff, as administrator of his father's estate, for the balance of the
bid at the sale. How then could the court take the facts of the case
from the jury, and say "that Mr. Ross, who never paid a dollar, was
a, bona fide legal purchaser-that he bought for himself, not as a trustee for Ormsby or any body else?"
It was relied on, as one of the strong circumstances conducing to
prove fraud, that there was no change of possession. It may also be
well asked to whom did the property belong,when Ormsby. receipted to the sheriff, as administrator of his father's estate ? The property
is paid for, if paid at all, with the money of the heirs of John Ormsby
Without their consent, no man and ,no court had a right to convert
more of the real estate into money, than was sufficient to pay the debts.
We have here the case of an administrator purchasing at sheriff's sale,
individually, and paying for the land with the plaintiffs' money. Can
plaintiffs resort to the land? IA 1 Serg. & Rawle, 144, when real
estate., was bought by a guardian, with the funds 'of his wards, the
land was treated as. theirs'; and his making the copveyances to himself exclusively, was held fraudulent of itself: what is this:but the ordinary case of a man purchasing with the money of others, and taking
the deed in his own name? See 2 Watts' Penn. Rep. 324; Kisler v.
Kisler, and Law v. Doighton, Ambler's Rep. 406; Lench v. Lench,
10 Vesey, 506; and Waite v, Whorewood, which was the case of an
executor, in 2 Atkyns, 159; Wolf v. Smyser et al. 2 Penn. Rep. 347.
So in Hempstead v. Hempstead, 2 Wendel, 199. It is expressly said
by the cotirt, that cestui que trusts, who have paid the consideration,
money of land patented in other names, may maintain ejectment. See
opinion of the court, page 134. In Fellows v.,Fellows, 4 Cowan's Rep.
it was decided that an administrator who buys land on a judgment of
his intestate, must account for it to his cestui' que trusts; he was an
agent and trustee, and could hiot divest, himself of the trust. Cited

Mr. Watts, for the defendants in error, upon the exception taken
by the counsel for the plaintiff to the charge of the court, that fraud
must be broughtto the knowledge of Mr. Rbss, and that the title derived from him was good 'in his vendees, contended that this point involved a question of law and a question of fact. As to the question
of law, that the court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of controversy, the court answered it as requested by the plaintiff; for the
whole cause, the charge of the- court, the verdict and judgment was
based upon the fact that the court did entertain jurisdiction. And
as to the matter of fact, whether the conduct of Oliver Ormsby was
fraudulent or not, it was expressly referred to the jusry to determine.
Any other direction by the eouri would have been erroneous. This
point necessarily raises the question, whetb'er the conduct of Ormsby was fraudulent? The argument of the plaintiff assumes the fact,
that Mr. Ormsby was the trustee of'the heirs of his father, John Orm$by, dece- sed. In Pennsylvania, there is no kind of connection between the administrator of the personal estate, and the interests of
the heirs, as regards the real estate; as to the realty, the adrpiiistrator is as a perfect stranger; and, upon a sale of it by the sheriff, upon
an execution, he may become the purchaser. Cases have been cited,
in the argument of the plaintiffs' counsel, to show that'an administrator cannot become a purchaser of land sold by himself; also, that
fraudulent conduct of an administrator, in making sale of land, will
vitiate it. This is true, but it is difficult to discover what application
-it has to the law of this case. Whenever an administrator makes a
sale of land in Pennsylvania, he does not do it as an administrator ex
offieio, but by a special order of the orphans' court, for some particular purpose; such as the payment of debts. In such case, he cannot be the vendor and the vendee; and, it is equally plain, he must
act fairly in conducting such sale: and this is the principle established by the cases referred to.
If the plaifitiff had it in his power to show that persoral estate of
John Ormsby had come to the hands of his administrator, 0. Ormsby,
to an amount sufficient to pay the debt of the Penns; and that he had

SUPREME COURT.
[S Wayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

not paid it, but suffered the land to be sold, and become the purchaser
himself, there would have been some pretext for the argument, that
0.Ormsby's title was fraudulently obtained: but, as the facts are, and
the proof in the cause is, that, although 0. Ormsby did take out letters of administration, no estate ever came to his hands to be administered, or which, by law, was applicable to the payment of the debts
of the intestate; no trust, in relation to the land in dispute, existed be/tween the parties to this action; and Oliver Orimsby was as competent to become the purcbser at she1'iff's sale, as any other individual.
But ',e did not thus purchase.
When James Ross purchased the land, he purchased it for himself; and, if he be believed, he never had any previous understanding or arrangement with 0. Ormsby on the subject. His object was,
first, to secure the debt due to jhe Penns; and that accomplished,
he was willing to convey to 0. Ormsby his title to the land, upon
being released from the payment of the balance of the purchase money, after Penn's judgment was paid. Mr. 0. Ormsby agreed to take
the land from him at the price he had paid for it. Who were defrauded? The -heirs of John Ormsby? By whom? Mr. Ross exprdssly says
that 0. Ormsby was not present at the sale, that he was away from
home, and when he returned he told him of it: he also says that, at
the time of the sale, his intention was, and, he said, at the time the
property was sold, if Mr. Ormsby or any other of his family was able
to redeem it, he might have it on the payment of the money. At that
period, these lots were of very little comparative value; and perhaps
0. Ormsby was the only individual who would have given for them
the price at which they sold at -sheriff's sale.
0. Ormsby gave his receipt to the sheriff for the balance of the
purchase money, after the payment of the lien for which the land was
sold, thus charging himself as administrator, and his security in the
administration bond, with this money, for which he was accou ntable
to the heirs. Under the facts of this case, it is quite impossible that
there could have been fraud on the part of 0. Ormsby alone; if fraud
was committed, James Ross must have been a party to it: for, if he
were a bona fide purchaser of the land at sheriff's sale, all idea of
fraud, subsequently committed, is out of the question; for 0. Ormsby
never had one trait of the chara&er of a trustee with respect to this
land. The conveyance by James Ross to him, is absolute and unqualified by any trust; and, it is hot pretended to be shown, that 0. Ormsby
purchased the land in trust for the plaintiff. It was pertinently re-

[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et all,

marked by the court below, in their charge to the jury: "Suppose
the property had depreciated in value after he received the conveyance from Mr. Ross, would he have been permitted, under the circumstances disclosed, to cast it upon the estate of John Ormsby, and
to cancel his liability arising from his receipt to. the sheriff? But the
claim of the plaiptiff is founded upon an alleged-fraud of 0. Ormsby:.
and the answer to it is, that it most manifestly appears, that, before
he did one act, or uttered one syllable in relation to the land in controversy, there Was an indefeasible, legal title vested, in'James Ross,
by a judicial sale. 0. Ormsby was bound by no legal or moral obligation to accept James Ross's offer to permit him to redeem; and, if
he did accept it, it was upon the terms mentioned in the deed, by
which the transaction was consummated and the title vested in him.
But, it is said, that a number of lots were levied on in nmass, and so
sold, instead of having been separated. What had 0. Ormsby to do
with that? If heirs or creditors were injuriously affected by it, their
remedy was to apply to the court to set the sale aside.: but that was
not done: nor have the defendants, upon the trial of this cause, pretended to prove that the lots'were worth one dollar more than the
price for which they sold.
The question of fraud, being a matter of fact, was distinctly submitted to the jury by the court; and they have found against the

Mr. Justice M'LEAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
An action of ejectment was brought in the western district of
Pennsylvania, by the plaintiffs against the defendants, to recover the
land in controversy. Both parties claim by descent from John
Ormsby, sen. who died in Alleghany county, Pennsylvania, in December, 1805. The deceased had a son, Oliver, who survived him,
and who administered on his estate; and a daughter, Sidney, who
married Isaac Gregg. He had also a son called John Ormsby, jun.
who married in the Mississippi country, and died in August, 1795.
Mary Swayze, the wife of the plaintiff, is the daughter of this son;
and was an infant at his decease.
In December, 1807, Oliver Ormsby gave bond as administrator
of his father; but it seems he filed no inventory of the personal
estate, as the law required, nor did he ever settle his administration
account.
On the 6th September, 1826, as administrator, he confessed a

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

judgment for four hundred and sixty-seven dollars and sixty-four
cents, in favoui of Messrs. Penns, Mr. James Ross acting as the attorney of the plaintiffs. An execution was issued on this judgmdnt,
and the premises were sold to Mr. Ross for three thousand dollars.
He declared, publicly, at the sale, that Ormsby or any of his family
might redeem the land, at any time, on the payment of -debts and
interest;" and ,Mr. Ross further states, that before the sale, Mr.
Ormsby was infbrmed that he only wanted the money on the judgment, and that he did not intend to buy the land to hold it.
No money was paid by 'Mr. Ross at the sheriff's sale, or at the
time be received the sheriff's deed. Ormsby'remained in possession of the land, receiving the rents and profits; and in April, 1831,
four years after the sheriff's sale, he paid Ross five hundred and
twenty-three dollars, the amount of the judgment and interest; and
received from him a conveyance of the land. At this time, Ormsby
receipted to the sheriff, as administrator, fcr the balance of the three
thousand dollars, after deducting the amount paid to Ross. The
sheriff's deed to Ross, and the deed from him to Ormsby, were recorded on the same. day.
The land in controversy consists of eighteen coal-hill lots near
P-ittsburg, and thirty-five acres adjoining them, and which is now of
great value; and was worth a large sum at the time of the sheriff's sale.
There was a letter in evidenc6, written by Oliver Ormsby to Mrs.
Swayze,. dated 19th March, 1828, at Natchez, in which he says:
"My father, at his death, was not possessed ot more property than
a stfficiency to pay his debts; having, from time to time, sold to individuals, and conveyed to his children." And there was evidence
conduci'ng to show, that the sale of two of the lots would have satisfied the judgment.
On these facts and others in the case, the counsel for the plaintiffs
prayed the court to instruct the jury, that, " in matters of fraud,
courts of law and -chancery have a concurrent jurisdiction. It is
therefore within the province of the jury to inquire whether the
conduct and proceedings of Oliver Ormsby, whereby the legal title
to the property in dispute, became vested in himself, for his exclusive usb-and benefit, were in fraud of his co-tenant, Mary Swayze;
and if they were, the verdict ought to he for the plaintiffs." This
instruction was given, as requested, with this qualification, "that
the fraud should be brought to the knowledge ol Mr. Ross; and
that, if he took a valid title under the sheriff's deed, the title of

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

his vendee would be good, under the circumstances disclosed in
evidence."

To the refusal of the instruction as requested, and the instruction
as given, an exception was taken; which raises the question of law,
whether, to render the title of Ormsby, as get up by the defendants,
inoperative and void, it is essential that Ross'should have partiipated in the -fraud.
The charge of the judge was explicit on this point. He not only
instructed the jury, that, to make the title of-Grmsby fraudulent,
Ross must have had a knowledge of the fraud; but assuming, it
would seem, the provinte of the jury, he declared that the fairness
of the transaction was above suspicion.
That fraud is cognizable in a court of law, as Well as in a court of
equity, is a well established principle. It has been often so ruled in
this Court.
As there is no court of chancery under the laws of Pennsylvania,,
an action of ejectment is sustained, on an equitable title, by the
courts of that state. Such is not the practice in the courts of the
United States; and in this case, if the plaintiffs fail to show a paramount legal title in themselves, they canhot recover.
It is unnecessary to inquire, whether, under the circumstances,
Ormsby did not receive the conveyance of the land from Ross, in
trust, for the heirs of his father, generally. This inquiry would be
appropriate in the exercise of a chancery jurisdiction, on a bill
framed for the purpose. But the jury were limited to the question
of fraud. The deed by the sheriff to Ross, and the one from him to
Ormsby, contain upon their. face all the requisites of legal conveyances; and, they must be operative to convey the title, unless the circumstances under which they were executed make them void.
• In 1807, Ormsby took out letters of administration; but he seems
to have acted, in the management of the estate, without regard to
the law, or the obligations of his administration bond. He filed no
inventory, made no settlement of his accounts. In 1825, he promised to pay the debt in the hands of Ross, but he took no step to
fulfil this promise. It was his duty, as administrator, to make application to the orphans" court for authority to sell as much of the real
estate as would, pay the debt. But, to obtain this order, it would
have been necessary to show that the personal assets were exhausted.
. In 1826, he confessed a judgment, and suffered an execution to be
taken out, and the property in controversy to be sold. He remained

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke at al.]

in the undisturbed possession of the property, enjoying the rents
and profits; and then received a conveyance of the land from Ross,
on the payment of the judgment, and receipting to the sheriff for
the balance of the purchase money. And, prior to this time, by
his letters, he informs Mrs. Swayze, who lived in Mississippi, and
still resides there, that the property left by his father would all be
k
consumed in the payment of debts.
In deciding the question of law raised by the exception, it may
not be proper for this Court to say whether these facts do not show
fraud in the administrator. The facts were properly before the jury,
and it was for them to determine the question of fraud. But, may
Ormsby and his representatives bold the land under their deed, unless ,t shall be shown that Ross participated in the fraud?
A bona fide purchaser, without notice, is not affected by the fraud
of his grantor; and it is admitted that a conveyance by such patrchaser, to a person who may have knowledge of the fraud, would be
valid. But, the purchase and conveyance of Ross, cannot be considered as coming, within this rule.
In the first pla~e, Ross did not purchase with the intention of
holding the property. This was declared publicly at the sale; and
some time before it took place, the same determination was made
known by him to the administrator. And, in the second place, it
appears the purchase was never perfected by Ross, He received the
sheriff's deed, but he paid no part of the consideration. In this state
the matter remained four yeirs; and until the administrator paid the
judgment, and receipted to the sheriff for the residue of the purchase money. On this payment, he received a deed from Ross; and
then he caused the sheriff's deed to be placed on record.
In making the purchase, Ross seems to have had no design to aid
the administrator in the perpetration of a fraud, if such were his intention: or to defeat or embarrass the claims of the heirs of John
Ormsby, sen. By the proceeding, he was desirous of securing the
debt placed in his hands for collection; and, for the payment of
which, he felt himself personally responsible. The judgment, and
the sale of the land, secured the desired object. It might have been
secured by the Judgment only.
The purchase, at the sheriff's sale, was not made by Ross on his
bwn account, or for the benefit of the plaintiffs in the judgment.
Ha ying fixed a lien on the land by the judgment and sale, he did
nidt desire to complete his purchase by the payment of the money.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

And, it is clear that a purchaser at sheriff's sale, cannot protect himself against a.prior claim, of which he had no notice; or be held a
bona fide purchaser, unless.he shall have paid the money.
Had the administrator, under the circumstances of'this case, become the purchaser at the sheriff's sale, could he have held the land
as a bona fide purchaser? His omissions of duty, in failing, to accoupt for any assets which may have come into his possession, and
his neglect .to apply to the orphans' court, for authority to sell a part
of the real estate to pay the debt, canected with the judgment and
the proceedings under it; are! facts from which a jury might, in the
exercise of their judgment,. have inferred fraud.
Had the administrator fraudulently furnished an agent with money,
and employed him to purchase at the sheriff's sale, could a title thus
acquired ,be held -valid against the heirs of John Ormsby, sen. though
'the deed might have been made to the agent? The agent may be
supposed to have been made the innocent instrument of fraud, by
the administrator; and whether the title apparently remained in the
agent, or hid been conveyed to the administrator, could not the
fraud be inquired into at law?
There-may not have been, in terms, an agreement between Ross,
and the administrator, that the purchase should be made at the
sheriff's sale, by the former, as 'agent of the latter. But, before the
sale, the administrator was assured by Ross, that he would not purchase to hold the land; and his high character was a sufficient guarantee on the subject: and may not this conduce somewhat to show
to a jury why the eighteen lots, and the thirty-five acres adjoining,
were sold on the execution, when the sale of two or three of the lots
would, probably, have satisfied the judgment?
The money was paid
bk the administrator.
. In making the purchase, Ross seems, in effect, to have acted as the
agent of the administrator; and it was proper for the jury to inquire
whether the transaction was not fraudulent. If the administrator
suffered the'land to be sold, through the agency of Ross, with the
viewpf securing the titleto himself, to the exclusion of the other
heirs of his father, the proceeding Was fraudulent and void. And,
as Ross could not be considered a bona fide purchaser, against the
legal and equitable-right of the plaintiffs, he not having paid the purchase-money; the deed which he executed to Ormsby is not a bona
fide conveyance. Had the plaintiffs brought their action against
Ross, he could not have defended himself, under the sheriff's deed;
VOL. XII.-D

SUPREME COURT.
[Swayze and Wife v. Burke et al.]

without showing the payment of the consideration. Nor is this
deed a good defence against the right of the plaintiffs, under the circumstances of the case, when set up -by Oliver Ormsby or his representatives. To, the objection already stated to the title of Ross, may
be superadded all the circumstances going to show fraud in tho administrator; and of which the jury are the proper judges.
We think, therefore, that the judge erred in charging the jury
that the deed to Ormsby was valid, unless they should find that Ross
participated in the fraud; and, on this ground, the judgment of the
court below is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.

This cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from
the district court of the United States, for the western district of
Pennsylvania; and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof,
it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court, that the judgment
of the district court be, and the same is hereby reversed; and that
this cause be, and the same is hereby remanded to the said district
court, with instructions to award a venire facias de novo.
