THER AND NEXT FRIEND, APPELLEES.

The complainants in their bill allege, that a conveyance of her real estate was made
by a daughter to her father, for a nominal consideration. The answer denied the'
matter stated in the bill; and the defendants gave evidence of the transfer of stock',
to the value of two thousand dollars, on the day the conveyance was made, claiming that this was also the consideration in the deed. Held, that this evidence was
admissible, without an amendment of the answer. It rebutted the allegation in
the bill, that the deed was made wholly withou consideration.
The complainants, as the ground to invalidate a deed, made by a daughter, of twentythree years of age, to her fatherx by whicli she conveyed the estate of her deceased
mother, to her father; he having a life estate, as tenant by the curtesy, in the same;
asserted that such a deed ought, upon considerations of public policy, growing out
of the relations of the parties, be deemed void. The Court said: We do not deem
it necessary to travel over all the English authoritie s which have been cited; we
have looked into the leading cases, and cannot discover any thing to warrant the
broad and unqualified doctrine asseited. All the cases are accompanied with some
ingredient, showing utldue -influence exercised by the parent, operating on the
fears or hopes of the child; and sufficient to show reasonable grounds to presume,
that the act was not.perfectly free and voluntary, on the part of the child; and in
some cases, although there may be circumstances tending, in some small degree,
to show undue influence; yet if the agreement appears reasonable, it haa been considered enough to outweigh slight circumstances, so as not to affect the validity of
the deed. It becomes less necessary for the Court to go into a critical examiration of the English chancery doctrine on this subject; for, should the cases be found
to countenance it, we hould not be dispoged to adopt or sanction the broad principle, that the deed of a child to a parent, is to be deemed, prima facie, void.
To consider a parent disqualified to take a voluntary deed from his child, without
consideration, on account of their r61ationship, is opening a principle at war with
all filial, as well as parental duty and affection; and acting on the presumption that
a parent, instead of wishing to promote the interest and welfare, would be seeking
to overreach and defraud his child. Whereas, the presumption ought to be, in the
tbsence of all proof tending to a contrary conclusion, thut the advancemefit ofthe
interest of the child was the object in view ; and to presume the existence of circumstances conducing to that result. Such a presumption .harmonizes with the
moral obligations of a parent to provide for his child; and is founded upon the
same.benign principle that governs cases of purchases made by parents, in the
name of a child. The natural and reasonable presumption- in all transactions of
this kind is, that a benefit was intended the child, because in the discharge of a moral and parental duty.
In the year 1813, a daughter, twenty-three years old, cdnveyed all ber remainder in
the real estate wich.had belonged to her mo.her, to her father, for a nominal consideration. ' She married two years afterwards, and died in 1818. No complaint
of the transaction was made in the lifetime of the daughter, nor during the life-

time of the father, who died in 1831. Lapse of time, and the death of the parties
to a deed, have always been considered, in a court of clancery, 6ntitled to great
weight; and almost controlling circumstances in cases of this kind.

ON

'appeal from ,the circuit ,ourt of the United States of the Dis-

trict Of Columbia, for the county of Alexandria..
In the circuit court, the appellees filed their bill against John J.
Jenkins, and Mary, the wife of Robert Morrow, children of George
Jenkins by a second wife; the said George Jenkins having died on
the 8th day of April, 1831; to set aside a certain deed executed by
Eleanor Jenkins, who-was the daughter of George Jenkins and the
mother of the complainants, and who died in 1818. George Jenkins
had first intermarried with Mary Arell, who, .as one of the heirs of
Richard Arell, was entitled to considerable real estate; of which partition was- made in 1797. She died5 leaving' but one child, the
mother of.the complainants; and her estate descended to her daughter,
subject to a life estate in George Jenkins, as tenant by the curtesy.
George Jenkins, after her decease, married end had children by his
second wife, one of whom is-one of the appellants in the case. The
deed was duly executed by the mother of the complainants, on the 15th
of March, 1813, and recorded on the 3d of November, in the same
year; and conveyed in fee simple to George Jenkins, for.a nominal
considerationa, all the real estate and ground rent6 to which she was
entitled asthe heir of her mother. The bill also sought to recover
the value of certain real estae, part of that conveyed to George Jenkins, which was afterwards sold by him to different persons;. and
also the rents of part of the real estate left unsold at the death of
George Jenkins, a-nd received by the executor, after his decease. The
complainants charge in their bill, that the deed executed by their
mother, being made wholly without consideration, operated to create
a resulting trust in favour, of Eleanor Jenkins and her heirs: and
they claim, if this cannot be sustained, that the deed was obtained
by the undue influence of paternal authority; and was therefore void
against the grantor and her heirs, in equity: and ask that it be vacated as to all the property conveyed by it, which was unsold at the
decease of George Jenkins.
The answer of the defendants denies that any undue influence was
exercised by George Jenkins over his daughter; who, when she executed the deed, was twenty-three years of age, and was at the time

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkin et al. v. Pye et al.]

-Well acquainted with her, rights, and With the. value of the property.
On the trial it wis admitted, that no undue influencewas exercised by
the father; and it was in:evidence, that when the deed was, recorded,
George Jenkins gave- to his daughter two thousand dollars in bat*
stock. This, and the further consideration that the daughter was to
receive a proportionate part of- her father's estate, who,;in addition
to the property conveyed by the deed, was wealthy' and the estate
conveyed being such gs. required latge expenses for its preservation
and improvement; were asserted.to be a valuable consideration for
the deed.
The circuit court djecreed the deed to be null and void;, because the
same was made without "any consideration," and because the same
was obtained "soon after 'the minority of said Eleanor, and while she
yet remained under his power and control, and uninformed of the
nature and extent of her rights;" and having. decreed also, that one-of
the appellants, John J. Jenkins, as administrator aforesaid, should pay
three thousand six hundred and seve nty-seven dollars and one cent,.
being a balance due, after deducting two thousand dolhars,'paid on the
3d of November, 1813, With interest from 8th of April, 1831, or account ofmoney received for sales of part of said property; and also,
the 'sum .of one 'thousand- one hundred and sixty-seven dollars and
five cents, amount of rents alleged to have been received since the
death of the said George Jenkins; and also, the sum of eighteen dollars and twenty-five cents, with interest from said 8th of April, 1831,
Which had.been received by George Jenkins on the partition of the
estate, for owelty of partition, awarded in 1797.
The defendants appealed to this Court. The case was argued by
Mr. Robert I: Brent and Mr. Jones for the appellants, and by Mr.
Simmes, and Coxe for the appellees.
Mr. Brent contended,
1st. That there can be 'no resulting trust as charged in the bill;
because that doctrine is confined to cases where the trust results to a
purchaser takipg a conveyance in the name of a third person, or similar cases; 2 Atkyn's Rep. 256; 2 Mad. Chan. Prac. 113; 4 Kent's
Com. (ed. 1832,) 305.,
2d. The bill takes the alternative ground, in case the resulting
trust fails; that the deed of March, 1813, executed by Eleanor Jenkins (the daughter) to George Jenkins, (the father,) Iwas obtained by
the ur'due influence 'of paternal authority.

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye'et al.]

The answer of the'defendants positively denies the charge of
undue influence; and this denial is conclusive to negative the charge
in the absence of all other testimony.
The case of the complainants stands alone on the broad and naked
principle that all transactions or dealings between parent and child
by which a benefit passes to the former is interdicted, "ipso facto;"
by the policy of the law. We deny that spri is the settled rule of
law, and confidently assert, that in every adjudged case there was
some circumstance of undue influence proved, and required by the
court as a material ingreJient.. Huguenir v. Basely, 14 Vesey, 291;
2 Atkyns, 254, 258; 1 Peer. Williams, 607; 1 Peere Williams, 639;
1 Atkynsi 402; 2 Atkyns, 85; 2 Atkyns, 160; 1 Mad. Chan. Prac.
309; Green v. Green, 1 Bros. Parl. Cas. 143; Lewis v. Pead, 1 Ves.
Jr., 19; Pratt v. Barker, 1 Simon's Rep. 1; King y. Hamlett; 2Mylne and Keene, 474, 480; Pothier, Oblig. (old edit.) 22.
3d. Admitting that this deed was purely voluntary, an absolute
gift of. all the property by a daughter twenty-thret years of age to
her father; still the conveyance ought to be sustained, because it may
have been the true interest of Eleanor Jenkins to place herself on the
same footing'with her brother and sister by a different mother: her
father was a man of large fortune, and it might be greatly to her
benefit to divest herself of her remote reversion, and come in, share
and share alike, with her brother and sister.
At all' events, such a settlement would be reasonable and just towards her half-brother and sister; and on that ground alone' would
be valid; I Atkyns, 5, 6.
4th. Whatever piay have been the abuse of parental authority by
George Jenkins in procuring the deed of March, 1813; the equity of
the complainants is 4osf by the lapse of time,, (nineteen years,) and
the circumstances of the case.
On this point it appearm that Eleanor Jenkins was not married for
two years after the date of the deed; and that she. lived several years
after her intermarriage with James Pye (the next friend of the infant
complinants); that George Jenkins lived until 1831; and that not a
word of complaint against the fairness of the deed of March, 1813,
was ever uttered in the lifetime of either of the original parties to
that'deed. The Court would make wild work to unravel the transaction under such circumstances. Bower v. Carter, 5 Vesey, 875,
879;'17 Vesey, 97, 100; 1 Jac. &Walk. 63.
5th. But conceding all pre. ious- propositions, it appears that. two

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

245

[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

thousand dollars was paid by George Jenkins to Eleanor Jenkins on
the 3d November, 1813, the day of recording the deed; this was a full
and adequate consideration for the reversion dependant on a robust
life, and considering the dilapidated'situation of the property. And
it farther appears, that George Jenkins applied one thousand dollars
to the education of Sarah M. Pye (one of the complainants); these
facts prove the consideration paid, and, to be paid, for the purchase
of Eleanor Jenkins' reversionary interest.
6th. On the hypothesis that the deed of March; 1.813 is to be annulled, then the court below erred in not allowing the appellants
interest on -the sum of two thousand dollars paid to Eleanor Jenkins,
on the 3d, of November; 1813; and in not crediting George Jenkins'
estate with the advances made by him to the children of Eleanor
Jenkins; and which could not be considered in the light of donations,
if this deed is pronounced irvalid. Slocum v. Marshal, 2 Wash. C.
C. R. 401.
7th. The court erred in charging George Jenkins' estate with a
sum of money paid him in 1797, in right of his wife, (the mother of
Eleanor Jenkins) for owelty of partition; because, first, the hill did
not claim it, 9 Cranch, 19; second, the husband was entitled tp the
money as personalty not realty, 1 Har. & Gill, 277.
Mr. Jones stated that there was nothing in this case, upon the bill,
answer and evidence, but the ease of a daughter of fuH age, having
conveyed her residuary interest in her estate to her father; he having
an intermediate estate for life in the property, as 'a tenant by the
curtesy. At the time of the conveyance, he was in full life and
health; and he actually lived eighteen years after the conveyance
was made. There is no allegation of undue parental influence. This
is disclaimed; and the high character of the father forbids such a
belief. The father appropriated two thousand dollars of stock to the
benefit of the daughter, on .the day the conveyance was recorded.
which amount he received from the sale, in fee simple, of a partof
the estate, which was at the same time sold for three thousand
dollars.
If the deed is to be set aside, it Will be on the principle that such
a conveyance by ft daughter to a father cannot be made. That the
relations of a child to a parent are such, as to forbid her the exercise
of a fair and just 'discretion and judgment; and that a court of chan-

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

cery will presume all such conveyances fraudulent, and will avcid
them.
Mr.. Jones denied that such principles were just to the relations of
a parent to a child; and he'denied that any such rule had been established by the decisions of courts of chancery.
No case had been cited, ane none could be found, in which the
mere faict of such a conveyance furnished a ground to vacate it. In
all the cases there had- been other matters which satisfied the chancellor that the deed should be avoided.
The presumption should be. in favour of 'such a transaction as that
befQre the Court. It was between a father and his child; between
one who had every inducement, from nature and from duty, to take
care of and protect and promote the interests of his child. Would
the CoUrt, against these bonds of union, against the influence of a relationship which should be believed to operate qnly for the benefit
of the child. infer the violation of every duty, and believe that all-these
feelingwere'disregarded? Would they apply a rule to such a case,
which could have had no origin but in a bosom devoid of every
affection-which should prevail in it? A court of :chancery, to adopt
such principles, must disregard the best and the most influential
sympathies and affections of our nature; and must look at man as
wanting in all that ornaments and dignifies him.
Mr. Semmes, for the appellees, after fully stating the facts,.regretted that his absence from the Court during the opening argument
of. the counsel for the appellants on the previous day, would limit
his remarks to a consideration of the causes of error assigned by the
appellants in their printed brief. These assignments of error he
would, however, take up seriatim; and felt confident that an investigation of them would disclose the wl'ole merits of the controversy,
both. on the law and the facts.
The appellants contend that the decree ought to be reversed for
the following reasons:
1st. That the court below erred in refusing to allow the appellants
to amend their answer, upon newly discovered evidence, so as to
plead the fact of a valuable consideration having been paid fdr the
property conveyed in the deed, in order to let in proof of the same.
The ,prayer of the petition was properly refused. It was made
after the hearing-afterthe court had pronounced their opinion in
the case, and were about proceeding to enter a final decree. Petitions

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

247

[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al,]

to amend the pleadings bbth. at law and in equity are addressed to
the soun( discretion of the Court; when that discretion has once been
exercised, it is absolute, and admits of no question. A refusal to
permit such amendwients can never be assigned as error in an appellate court. Were the action of the court below subject to such
re. ision, it would cease to have a discretion in the matter. Amendments in an answer will never be permitted after the hearing. -Cited
1 Harr. Chan. Prac. 226, et seq.; Rawlins v. Powell, 1 P. Wms. 297;
Calloway v. Dobson, 1 Brockenborough, 119.
But the petition was rightly refused on the face of it. It does not
allege the discovery of new evidence; but is in truth a prayer to
amend, that a new version may be given to a fact already before the
court, and on which they had judicially passed. The amen dment
desired was, that they might allege a t-ansfer of two, thousand dollars in bank stock, made Novdinber 3d, 1813, to be the cohsideration
of the deed executed on March 15th, 1813. It was a petition for a
new argument on the state of facts already considered by the court.
The answer of Jenkins had alleged the transfer of large amounts of
bank stock; the report of the master commissioner, and the certificate of the bank clerk, had ascertained that amount to have been
the two thousand dollars in question; this was then before the'court;
was climed as an offset in the court below by the appellants; and
when, two years after the commissioner's report, the court were about
proceeding to a final decree, this petition was put in for an amendment, by which a fact so vell known might be wrested to a purpose
that the zealous defence of the appellants below had never until that
moment contemplated. This transfer of bank stock, which can
never be admitted as the consideration of the deed from Eleanor to
her father; will assume a more important aspect in considering the
next .cause of error in the appellants' brief.
The petition was, mhoreover, detective in a material point. While
it alleged that this bank stock was the consideration of the deed, and
prayed the amendment to let in proof of that fact; it did not allege
the existence of evidence to substantiate the position, nor show a
probable case to the court that such was likely to be proven. The
petition to amend was, under all the circumstances,-properly refused.
The next cause of error is:
2dly. That said deed does not operate as a resulting1rust, as
charged in this case.
Although it is perfectly competent for the appellees to insist that

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

in this case a trust did technically result to'.h grantor and her heirs,
yet they do not consider it necessary to rely on that poiht. That
such trust on the facts of this case would have resulted, cited 2
Story's Equity, 440.
The facts show that the original parties to the deed must have
contemplated a trust. The two thousand, dollars now sought to be
made the .c.onsideratibn of the deed, was part of
the larger sum of
three thousand dollars; for which one of the lots, covered by, it, was
sold a few days before to Harper & Davis. Here was a direct application by the grantee, to the use of the grantor; of part'of the pro
ceeds of the property.
It was a direct recognition of the implied trust by George Jenkins; and alone would warrant the inference that such was the contemplation of the parties. But this point in the appellants' brief, as
well as the next, which is:
3dly. That there was no . undue influence" used, as charged in
this case; and that the evidence upon this point, so far as it goes,
shows the reverse, may be properly included under the fourth; which
is the only material question presented by the record. It may be as
well, hdwever, ,here to remark, that the appellees do not rely on any
allegation of actual" undue influence;" they do notimpugn the validity of this deed, on any charge of actualfraud. The grounds on
which they contend for its nullity, will be presently considered.
The answer of Jenkins is conclusive as to the point of restraint and
coercion. Being responsive to the bill, and uncontradicted by t~stimony, it disposes of that question. The appellees, then, must resort to higher and sterner principles of equity jurisprudence to sustain their case.
The next, and only important po;tmade by the appellants, is:
4thly. That said deed is valid, both in law and in equity.
No doctrine of the law is more firmly vstablished, or mow frequently acted op by courts of eqhity, than that all agreements, contracts, and conveyances procured by fraud, imposition, or undue influence, are null aid void.. As the rule is imperative where actual
fraud is established,, so is it equally binding when the circumstances
of the case, or the relations subsisting between the parties, are such
as to raise the presumption of implied fraud, or to warrant the inferenee that one of the contracting parties might have'been subjected
to oppression, or undue influence. The rule may appear arbitrary
and unjust at first sight, as calcitlated to impair tlie fr, - exercise of

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

volition' in persons competent to contract; and as having a tendency

to destroy vested rights, and operate injuriously on innocent third
persons. Correctly viewed, however, it will not appear obnoxious
to such' objections. The policy of the law must lay out and define
certain general principles as guides of action, and rules for construing all instruments and agreements.
Another broad department of equity jurisdiction is comprised in
the protection it holds out to .parties whom the law does not consider as altogether sui juris, in respect to the exercise of proprietary
rights; or as liable to be influenced by circumstances peculiar to
their age, capacity, or situation. Protecting weak, and incapacitated
persons from the effects of their own injudicious contracts, it well
becomes the jealous spirits of the courts to have marked out certain
social relations as peculiarly subject to suspicion and caution, in
respect to all agreements'between persons affected by considerations
or motives arising out of the relationship in question. Where one,
party is not peifectly free to act, and the other party has availed
himself of his power and influence in 'procuring, a conveyance or
contract, courts of equity dispeqse with proof of actual fraud or imposition; but inferring constraint from the relations of the parties,
will set aside such contract or conveyance, as contrary to public
policy. In all cases, the onus probandiis on the party setting up
such contract, to show an adequate consideration,'and the bona fide
character of the transaction. The relations between gua'dianand
ward,parent and child, solicitor or attorney and client, trustee
and cestui que trust, master and servant, and the cases of expectant heirs, and of reversioners,are jealously watched; and all contrats made during its existence, by the minor party, in each of these
relations to the superior, are scrutinized jealously; and, in some cases,
on bare suspicion of Undue influence; in others, on the mere relation
of the parties, fraud is inferred; and the contract or conveyance set
asid&. Contracts made soon afier the termination of such relations,
are, on. the same principle of policy, subjected to the operation
of the same wholesome rule. Nor will lapse of time, or the death
of the fraudulent.purchaser, so affect the case as to preclude the
granfor, and those claiming under him, from setting aside the contract. Authorities cited, Morse v. Royal, 12 Ves. 371; Wright

Administators, 2 Leigh, 11.
The case at bar, is one peculiarly calling for the application of the
principles recognised and established by the authorities cited. The
case is that of a deed made without consideration, from a young
daughter, not twenty-three years of age, to her wealthy father, with
whom she resided: conveying all her property.
Her father was
tenant by the curtesy, and held the particular life estate; her estate
was the reversion descended to her from her moiher, and dependent
thereon. She was then both under the parental influence, and presented the ease of a young heir dealing for an expectancy with a
party owning the particular estate, for no consideration, and With no
declaration of trust; a party whose position peculiarly subjected the
present contratt to the implication of fraud, or the suspicion of impositu!0.
The ground assumed by the appellants, that this isa voluntary
deed, and therefore good against the grantor, and all claiming under
her, cannot, on this aspect of the ease, be maintained. The general
principle introduced by the statutes 13 and 27 Eliz., re-eniacfed in
most of the states, that voluntary deeds, so far only as existing creditors and subsequent bona fide-and unnoticed purchasers are concerned, are void, is admitted by law. The exception which the
courts imply from, the terms of the statute, and the usual motive to
defraud creditors in all such conveyances, as against- the grantor and
his sub-claimants, seeking to recover the property, or vacate the conveyance, is the sole exception to this general rule. A party who has
conveyed away his property to evade the payment of his just debts,
shall not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong, and reclaim his property, against, the will of his grantee, the partner in the
fraud; when the claims of ceditors may have been otherwise satis-

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

fled, or a 'necessity for their interference has passed away. This
principle, with that other plain rule, giving any party competent to
contract, and uninfluenced by fraud, duress, or undue advantages
taken by the grantee, a free disposition over his property, cannot be
applied to the present case. A voluntary deed, to be good, must be
made ceteris paribus. If the party grantor be an infant, lunatic, or
subjected to the operation of those relations so jealously watched by
courts of equity; in some cases from the absolute nullity of the"contract; in others on the principles of public policy, that contract will
be set aside. By a voluntary deed, is meant a gift without' consideration: would theQ a voluntary deed, executed under duress, be sustairied? The relation of the parties assimilates the present deed to
one obtained by actual fraud, or undue influence.
The remaining causes of error were in reference to improper items
in the master commissioner's account; questions as to the effect of
evidence; the allowance of interest and costs; and the right to credits in the nature of offsets. Though material to the merits, the discussion of these points-is not of sufficient general importance to be
set out in the argument.
Mr. Justice THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case comes up on appeal from the circuit court of the District
of Columbia, for the county of Alexandria. The appellees were the.
complainants in the court below; and as heirs at law of their mother,
Eleanor Jenkins, filed their bill, by their father, James B. Pye, as
next friend, to set aside a deed given by their mother to George
Jenkins, -her father, bearing date the 15th of March, 1813. The
bill charges, that the deed was made wholly without consideration,
and operated only to create a resulting trust in-favour of the grantor
and her heirs; and if their claim cannot be sustained on that ground,
they charge that the deed was obtained by the undue influence of
parental authority, and therefore void in equity, against the said
Eleanor Jenkins and her heirs.
The consideration expressed in the deed is one dollar; and as to
the allegation of undue influence, the bill charges that the said
Eleanor inherited, as heir of her mother, the land conveyed to her
father, and in which her father was entitled to a life estate. That at
the time of her mother's death, she was an infant of very tender
years, residing with her father, and continued to reside with him
until her marriage. That she never was informed of the extent of

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins ot al. v. Pye et al.]

her property, to which shebecame entitled on the death of her mother; and having led a life of great seclusion, in the cointry,-at a
distance from Alexandria, where the, lands. are' situated, she had no
means of acquiring information on the subject. That very soon after
the said Eleanor had attained the age of twenty-one years, and Whilst
she still resided with her father, and remained, in ignorance of the
extent and valub of her rights; the said'george Jenkins, availing himself of his parental authority, and of the habit of implicit obedience,
and submission on the part of his child, procured from her the deed
in question.
The answers of 'the appellants deny every. material charge and
specification in the bill, tending to show that any undue influence
was exercised by the father, to obtain the deed from his daughter;
but that the act was voluntary and free on her part. That she was
well acquainted" with her rights, and the value of the ,property,
That at the time-of executing the deed, she was twenty-three years
of age; and that the same was not done in expectation -of her marriage, as she was not married for two years afterwards.
The mere nominal coasideration expressed on the face of the deed
was enough to pass the estate to. the grantee, no uses being declared
in the deed. Jt is true, as a general .proposition,dthat he who pays
the bcnsideration, means, in the absence of all rebutting circumstances to purchase for his own benefit; and there may be a resulting
trust for the use of the party paying the consideration. But this is
foundtd upon a mere implication of law, and may be rebutted by evidence, showing that such was not the intention of the parties. And
in the present case, the evidence is conclusive to show that no such
resulting use was intended. But it is unnecessary particularly to notice this evidence, as.this part of the case was not very much pressed
at the argument. And in addition to this, the evidence shows that
ou the 3d of November,181.3, the day her deed was offered for record
in Alexandria, George Jenkins paid to his daughter two thousand
dollars; which, uhder the situation of the property, might well be
considered nearly, if not quite, an adequate consideration. The property being int
a dilapidated state, requiring great, expense in repairs;
and the -grantee, George Jenkins, having a life estate in it, which,
from the circumstance of his living eighteen years after the date of
the deed, there is reason to conclude, that the state of his health and
constitution Was such at that time, as justly to estimate his life estate
of considerable value.

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

[Jenkins et al. v.Pye et al.]

The evidence of 'the payment of two thousand'dollars, in addition
to the nominal consideration of one 'dollar mentioned in the deed,
was 'admissible. without any amendment of the answer. It rebutted
the allegation in the bill, that the deed was made wholly'without consideration.
But the grounds mainly relied upon to invalidate.the dedd, were,
that being from a daughter to her father, rendered it at least, prima.
facie, void. And if'not void on this ground, it was so because it was
obtained by the undue influence of paternal authority.
The first gxound of objection seeks to0-establish the broad-princi-.
pie, that a deed from a child to a parent, conveying the real estate of
the child, ought, upon consideratk~ns of public policy, growing, ouV'
of the relation of the 'parties, to be deemed void: and numerous
eases in the English chancery have been referred to,. which are supposed to establish 'this principle. We do not deem it necessary. to
-travel over all. these authorities; we have looked into the leading,
'cases, and cannot discover any thing to warrant the broad. and- ur-'
qualified doctrine contended for on the part of the appellees. All
the. cases are accompanied with someingredient, showing undue influence exercised by the parent, operating upon the, fears or hopes
of the child; and. sufficient to show reasonable grounds to presume
that the act Was not perfectly free and voluntary on the part of the
child; 'and in some cases,,although there may be circumstances tending, in some small degree, to show. undue influence; yet if the agreement appears reasonable, it has been considered enough to outweigh
'light circumstances, so as not to affect the validity of the deed.
It becomes the less necessary for us to go into a critical examination of the English chancery doctrine on this subject, for should the
cases be found- to countenance it, we should not be disposed to adopt
child or sanction the broad principle contended for, that the deed of a
to Aparent is to be deemed, prima facie, Void. It is .undoub'tedly
the duty of courts carefully to watch and examine the-circumstances
attending transactions of this kind, when brought under review before them, to discover if any undue influence has been exercised in
obtaining the conveyance. But to consider a parent'disqualified to
take a voluritary deed from his child, without consideration, on account of their relationship; is assuming a principle at/ war with all
filial as well as parental duty and affection; and acting on the presumption, that a parent, instead of wishing to promote the interest

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

and welfare, would be seeking to overreach and defraud his child.
Whereas, the presumption ought to be, in the absence of all proof
tending to a contrary conclusion, That the advancement of the interest
of the child was the object in view; and to presume the existence
of circumsiances conducing to that result. Such a presumption harmonizes with the moral obligations of a parent to provide for his
child; and is founded upon the same benign principle that governs
cases of purchases made by parents in the name of a child. The
prima facie presumption is, that it was intended as an advancemeti
to the -child, and so not falling within fhe principle of a resulting
trust. The natural and reasonable presumption in all transactions of
this kind is, that a benefit was intended the child, because in the discharge of a moral and parental duty. And the interest of the child
is abundantly guarded and protected, by keeping a watchful eye over
the transaction, to see that no undue influence was brought to bear
upon it.
In the present case, every allegation in the bill tending to show
that any undue influence was used, is fully met and denied in the
answer .nd is utterly without proof to sustain it. And indeed this
allegation seemed to be abandoned on the argument.
But if any thing was wanting to resist the claim on the part of the
appellees, and to establish the deed, and the interest derived under it,
it will be found in the lapse of time. The deed.bears date the 3d of
November, 1813; the grantor, Eleanor Jenkins,.then being twentythree years of age. She was married about two years thereafter, and
died in the year 1818; -and not a whisper of complaint was heard
against the transaction during her lifetime. George Jenkins, the
grantee, lived until the year 1831, and no complaint was made in his
lifetime; after a lapse of eighteen years, it is difficult, if not impracticable, fully to explain the transaction.
Lapse of time, and the death of the parties to the d(ed, have always
been considered in a court of chancery, entitled to great weight, and
almost controlling circumstances, in cases of this kind.
But the circumstances, as disclosed by the proofs, not only rebut
every presumption of unfairness on the part of George, Jenkins, but
disclose circumstances, tending to show that he was governed by motives highly honourable and commendable. He was a man of large
estate - the property conveyed to him by his daughter was in a dilapidated and unprofitable condition. He had a life estate in it. And it
would have been unreasonable, if not unjust to his other children, to

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkins et al; v. Pye et al.]

have required him to incur great expenses in improving this property,
which would enure to the exclusive benefit of this daughter. His object, as well as that of his daughter, seems to have been to enable him
the more easily and satisfactorily to make an equal distribution of
his propertyamong all his children; as well the said Eleanor, as those
he had by a second marriage. This was a measure well calculated to
promote hIarmony among his children: and his intention to carry
that disposition of his property into execution, was manifested by the
will he made; which failed however of its full operation, by reason
of some informality in its execution. But the appellees have succeeded to a full and equal share of his estate, under the distribution
which the law has made; which is all that in equity and justice they
could claim.
This view of the case, renders it unnecessary to notice the points
made on the argument, in relation to the accounts which the appellees were called upon to render.
The decree of the court below is accordingly reversed, and the bill
dismissed,
Mr. Justice CATRON.
I concur with the majority of the Court, that the decree be reversed; but, differing most materially with the reasons and principles
on which the opinion of my brethren proceeds, I will briefly state
the difference, hoping sincerely I may be mistaken.
The cause must be reviewed here in the same form that the paities presented it to the circuit court: this is due to the court below,
and the only mode we can pursue as a court of appeals.
The bill was filed in July, 1833: the answer in May, 1834: the
replication in April, 1835: and, on the I Ith of May, the cause was,
by- agreement, set for hearing; and on the 26th of October, 1835,
was heard upon the bill and answers, with two additional facts,
which the parties admitted of record; to wit: 1. That George Jenkins
was, at the date of the deed from his daughter to him, in 1813, a
man of large fortune, and so continued till his death. 2. That the
deed conveyed all the estate to which the said Eleanor was in any
manner entitled. Upon this case, the court, on the 26th of October,
1835, decreed for the complainants; and ordered an account to be
taken of the rents of tbe'property in litigation since George Jenkins?
death, the parcels sold by him in his lifetime, and the value of the
estate in 1813, &c.

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.

On the 13th of May, 1837, ihe master commissioner eported; and
on the 31st of October, 1837, thereport was confirmed by a final decree of the court. Upon this proceeding, it will be remarked, that
the decree of October, 1835, could not be revetsed by that of 1837,
on evidence furnished to the commissioner in taking the account,
and which he reported to the court. The first decree could only
have been reached by a petition for a rehearing, (if filed in time)
or by a bill of review; and we must, therefore, examine the de-ree
of 1835, on the facts then presented to the circuit court.
The bill alleges-the conveyance of 1813 to have-been executed
without any valuable consideration; and that the daughter acted under
the influence of parental authority. That it was executed without
valuable consideration, the answers admit; but they deny that any
-constraint or parental authority was exercised, and respond that the.
deed was made freely and voluntarily. They also admit, that
Eleanor Jenkins was born the 17th September, 1790; tjhat her mother
died in 1796; that when the deed was nade, Eleanor wns Anly eighteen months over twenty-one years of age, and that she was the soleheir of her mother; the father and grantee being tenant by the curtesy of -the lands descended. That George Jenkins bad two other
children by a different mother, who are the defendants; and that be
died in 1831, intestate as regarded his realestate.
Eleanor Jenkins married in 1815, and died in 1818; leaving the
complainants her heirs.
It is also averred in the answers, that the property in 1813 was in
a dilapidated condition; and that it had suffered by fire, which ws'a
principal reason for making the conveyance. The averment is independent of any statement in the bil,'is traversed by the replication; and no proof having been made to sustain the averment, of
course it cannot be. noticed here. The defendants also insist, that
-the bill should be dismissed because of the lapse of time, and the
death of parties and witnesses.
This' being the case presented to the circuit, court in 1835, the
question is, did that court err in ordering the defendants to account?
Time and the death of George Jenkins aside, I think it imposSible so to ho!d; consistently with the best established doctrines governing a court of chancery.
The elements of the decree below were, 1. That 'the granttbr,
Eleanor Jenkins, was a young heir, and a woman, when she made

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkind et al. v. Pye et al.]

the conveyance; that it was of her whole estate, without consideration, and to a parent of large wealth.
2. That she was an heir of an estate in reversion, which descended
to her in tender infancy; and in regard to the possession and enjoyment of which she must be deemed and treated, in a court of chancery, as an expectant heir.
3. She conveyed to the adult tenant for life, who was her father
and natural guardian,with whom she resided, and on whom she
was dependent.
I propC§e to examine the cause, such as it is found;
not to speculate
upon'supposed cases of remainders acquired by purchase, and sold
by him who thus acquired; nor-upon cases where the tenant for life
jofns in the sale. These and other transfers of remainders, may
depend on very different principles from the case before the Court.
The two first grbunds, governing the decision of the circuit court,
will, be treated together; disregarding for the present the relation of
father and daughter.
In the language of Sir William Grant, in Gowland v. De Faria,
17 Vesey, 23, it will be laid dawn, that " this is the case of a person
who, in this court, is considered as an expectant heir;" and "that it
is incumbent upon those who have dealt with an expectant heir, relative to his reversionary interest, to make good the bargain: that is,
to be able to show that a full and adequate consideration was paid.
In all such cases, the issue is upon the adequacy of price; no proof
of fraud is necessary; and the relief is given upon general principles
of mischief to the public, without requiring particular evidence of
actual imposition."
2 Atk. 28; Jeremy's Eq. 398; 1 Story's Eq.
330, sedt. 338; 1 Fonblanque's Eq. B. 1, C. 2, sect. 12; 1 Mad. Ch.
118, state the result of the adjudications.
As some doubts are suggested by Mr. Justice Story, and by Mr.
Jeremy, in the passages cited of their treptises, whether the strictness
of the doctrine applies to cases of dealings, for remainders; it is
deemed necessary to go into a slight ieview of the leading adjudged
cases, to see if any conveyance rescinbling the present has been permitted to stand. It is but justice, however, to say, that I do not
suppose either of those highly respectable authors intended to question the doctrine in a case like the present; where th e estate in reversion descended upon an infant heir, encumbered with a life
interest, and the expectancy was given to the tenant for life, within
eighteen months after the heir came of 3ge. That such purchase is
VOL. XlI.-2 X

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al.v. Pye et al.]

a conftructive fraud, and the purchaser, if a stranger, compelled to
account, and give up his bargain, if found to be advantageous; has
not, for a century, been an open question. The conveyance is treated
as a mortgage, and the grantor relieved on payment of the principal
advanced and interest; without inquiry whether there was fraud or
imposition.
The doctrine, during the seventeenth century, met with some opposition, especially in the reigns of Car. II. and Jac. I.; but in Nott
v. Hill, I Vern. 169; 1P.W. 310; Newland on Contracts, 436; and
Bemey v. Pitt, 2 Vern. 14, it received the most conclusive confirmation short of the judgment of the house of lords. In the former case,
Lord Ch. Nottingham decreed redemptikn (in his own phrase): on

rehearing, Lord Keeper North reversed this decree, and refused re"
lief: but this last decree was again reheard before Lord Ch. Jeffries,
2 Vern. 27, and reversed, and. that of.Lord Nottingham confirmed.
So in Bemey v. Pitt, (the report of which is found in 2 Vern. 14;
1 P. W. 311; Newland Con. 347,) Lord Nottingham denied relief;
but Lord Ch. Jeffries, 2 Jac. 2, on rehearing) reversed the decree, and
let in the grantor to redeem on the usual terms of paying the money
advanced, with interest.
In the case of.Twisleton v. Griffith, (1716,) the exception was
again invoked, that there was no fraud in fact; it was urged, that at
this rate the heir of the remainder could not sell, as no one would
buy; to which Lord Cowper replied: " This might force an heir to
go home,,and submit to his father, or bite on the bridle, and endure
some hardships; and in tne meantime he might grow wiser, and, be
reclalmed," 1 P. W. 313.
In Peacock v. Evans, 16 Yes. 514, the master of the rolls says:
(when speaking of an heir selling the expectancy of a remainder
during hisfather's life,) "To, thaf class of persons, this court seems
t have extended a degree of protection approaching nearly to an
incapacity to hind themselves by contract;" and he cites with approbation, the expressions of Lord Ch.Eldon, in Coles v. Trecotheck,
9 Ves. 234; that, "The cases of reversions and interests of that sort
go upon a very different principle: in some, the whole duty of-makinig
good the bargain, upon the principles of this court, is upon the vendee,
And Sir William Grant
as in the instance of heirs expectant."
added: "The tendency of this doctrine to render all bargains with
such persons very insecure, if not altogether impracticable, seems not
to have been considered as operating to prevent its adoption and

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkins et al.v. Pye et al.]

establishment; but, on the contrary, some of the judges have avowed
that probable consequefice, as being to them the recommendation of
the doctrine."
In the case referred to, it wasadmitted there was nothing approaching to fraud or impositioh; yet the conveyance was set aside, because a full price had not been paid. All that could be said of it was,
that Mr. Peacock had obtained a very advantageous bargain.
So in Gowland v. De Faria, 17 Vesey, 23, where a .reversionary
interest bad been sold, in which' the plaintiff's mother had a life
estate, all fraud was denied; and no proof introduced, save that the
consideration was not full: and in reply to the argument of manifest
fairness, the master of the rolls replied: "In all these cases the issue
is on the inadequacy of price. This is the case of a person who, in
this court, is considered an expectant heir. He has charged his reversionary interest; and the question is, whether lie Has received an
adequate consideration. Upon that question the evidence "is all one
way:" and the conveyance was treated as a mortgage, vide Davis v.
Duke of Marlborough, 2 Swanston, 147.
To cite other, authorities to sustain the position assumed would
justly be deemeWt an incumbrance; and I will only ask, had Eleanor
Jenkins conveyed to a stranger instead of her father, could a court of
chancery have refused ber heirs relief, had they come in tithe?
And by way of introducing the next proposition, it will be sub'mitted, whether her father stood upon higher ground than a stranger?
To a proper understanding of this question, a slight reference must
be had to the facts, reported by the commLssioner, qs they appeared
on the final decree in October, 1837.' My brethren have given them
some consideration, nor will I pass them by; although the pleadings
Itis apprehended exclude them, they will be taken in connection
with the answers and admissions: George Jenkins, in 1813, and at his
death, was a man of large wealth. He had two sets of children; one
child by a first wife, and-two by a-second. The answer avers he procured the conveyance to do justice in his family. The account shows,
that Eleanor's and George Jenkins's joint interests were worth when
the deed was made in March, 1813, eight thousand nine hundred and
ninety-two dollars. and ninety-seven cents; ahd that about six months
after the execution of the deed, George Jenkins caused to be vested
in his daughter, Eleanor, two thousand dollars' worth of bank stock;
which was sold by Mr. Pve shortly after he married Eleanor.
Further than this, nothing was advanced to the daughter. George

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkinis et 41; v. Pye et al.]

Jenkins a'ed intestate, as regarded his, lands; whether by accident or
design, matters nothing to the infant children who are plaintiffs.
The answer avers, that the Complainants by the intestacy are entitled
to two-elevenths by their grandfather's estate; whereas were they to
obtain the lands conveyed by the deed of 18,13, and come in ajoint
heirs of the residuq, they would take more than one-half. What
advances were made by their father to the two children of George
Jenkins, who are defendants, does not appear; but that they take
nine-elevenths of the whole estate, by the intestacy, conclusively
proves, if George Jenkins obtained -the deed, "best to enable him to.
do .equat justice to dli his fanily," that he did no such equal
justice to his daughter Eleanor in her lifetime, or to her. children at
his death. He was a man of large wealth, and wasbound to do equal
justic6, if the answer be true; and the defendants aver they personally
know the fact to be so: ahd that' this was the'consideration of the
conveyance. If- it was, obtained for one purpose, and the property
applied to another; for instance, to advance the-fortunes of the second
set of children; it is well settled the deed should be set aside. To
prove it, I need only Cite the case of Young v. Peachy, 2 Atkyn.s,
254, whose authority has never 'been questiohed since Lord Hardwicke's time.
Again : Two thousand dollars ip bank stock was.a poor advance
for a man of large wealth, having only three children, on the intermarriage of one of them;. and we will. take it that Eleanor was not
intended to be turied off destitute.
The facts.thuw introduced from the commissioner's report, to con'trol the effect of the first decree, (could they be heard for such purpose,) are therefore of no value, and cannot help'the conveyance.
How then-did the father stand?
The jealousy with which courts of chancer.y watch contracts mfde
by parents with' children, js laid dowh with terseness and much accuracy by Mr. Justice Story in his lecture on -constructive frauds
1 Story's Ch. 306. He says- "The natural and just influence which
a parent has over a child, renders it peculiarly important for courts
of justice to watch over ahd protect the interests of' the later;' and
therefore all contracts and conveyances, whereby benefits are secured
by 'children to their parents, are objects of jealousy; and'if they are
not reasonable under the circumstances, they will be setaside."
Mr.' Newland in his treatise on- contracts, chapter 30, page 445,
gives the result of the authorities with, great clearness and force; and

JANUARY TERM, 1838.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

the accuracy of Which is fully borne out by the cases. "It is a natural pr-esumption," says he) "that a parent possesses influence: over
the mind of his child. Equity therefore regards with a jealous eye
contracts between them; and very properly considers this relation to
giveqadditioiiaiweight and suspicion to circumstances of fraudulent aspect, which the case may involve." And Lord Hardwicke said
in Young v. Peacy, 2 Atk. 258, where the transaction in its leading
features much"resembled this; the father having obtained a voluntary
conveyance from a daughter: "'But the case is greatly strengthened
when it comes to be considered that this was a recovery obtained
by a father from his child;, and when this is the. case, it affords another strong circumstance in order to relieve the plaintiffs."
The British adjudications, uniformly and firmly supporting the
doctrine, are cited by the writers above referred to. 1 Story's Eq.
306, Newl. 445, Madd. Chancy. 310; and with which I will rest
content: adding, however', that the case before us, is as bare of alleviating circumstances, tending to exempt it from the general rule, as
any I have found reported, or known in my experience 'in life.
Had the conveyance been made to a stranger, it cojuld not have been
tolerated for a moment; and having been made to the father, in the
language of Mr. Newland "The' relation gives -additional weight
and .suspicion to the circumstances which the case involVes." Its
decision rests not on discretion, but on settled rules of property;
which, it is supposed by me, should not be disfurbed.
But. first, more than twenty years elapsed, from the execution of
the conveyance to the time of fiing the bill; and second, ,it
was not
filed until after George Jenkins's death. The daughter and her heirs
having been at all times since 1813 free to stte; and having had the
means, and being under no undue restraint, the presumption is, that
time has destroyed the evidence going to prove the fairness of the
transaction; or that if the- suit had been brought in the .grantee's
lifetime, hp could 'have adduced it. I confess, however, it is with
some difficulty the presumption can be maintained, underithe circu mstances of this cause, by the British adjudications; -yet, our migratory
habits, and the consequent loss of evidence are such, that presumptions founded on time must. in- this country, be firmly supported,
without letting in doubtful exceptions to destroy their force: espe,
cially when those in whose knowledge the facts rested, which might
have explained the 'trafAction, are dead: as in Browh v. Carter, 5
Ves. 875, where the bill was brought to set aside a getffeinent upider

SUPREME COURT.
[Jenkins et al. v. Pye et al.]

an agreement between father and son, made in 1769. The conveyance was voluntary, as in the instance before the Court. The father
died in 1793: up to which time no complaint had been made; and
'very soon after the bill was filed. The Court hell, that, "though
transactions of this kind will be looked at with jealousy, that the
father should not take an improper advantage of his authority; the
complaint must always be made in 'time; not' after the father is
dead," &c.
The same doctrine was held by Lord Eskine in Morse v. Royal,
12 Ves. 376; and relief refused because of the lapse of time and the
death of witnesses.
The British case, however, which has most laboured this question,
is that of Chalmers v. Bradley, 1 Jac. & Walk. 58; in which the
authorities, are ieferred to, where the claims of expectant heirs to
have decrees for accounts, and the rescission of contradts, were rejected, because of the lapse of time intervening between the date of
the contract and the filing of the bill.
The general doctrine, that full force will be given to presumptions
founded on time, and that stale demands- will not be enforced to
compel parties to account, nor to disturb contracts or possessions, is
established on a very firm footing as the doctrine of this Court, in
Ricard v. Williams, 7 Wheat.; Hughes v. Edwards, 9 Wheat.; Willison v. Watkins, 3 Peters; Miller v. M'Intyre, 6 Peters; Piatt v.
Vattier, 9.Peters; and other decisions. But the difficulty in such
cases as the one before the Court is, that the expectant heir is usually
destituie,ignorant of his rights, and not on an equal footing With his
vendee: and the courts of chancery presume that he contracted in subsprviance'to circumstances, either of helpless poverty or ignorance;
or at least superior knowledge of facts on part of him with whom he
contracted. Wtien the facts proved are in accordance .ith the presumption, and establish that the same condition continued to the
datie when suit was brought, -time has not been strictly regarded in
England; ind chancery has frequently proceeded to afford relief,
disregarding the lengfh of time, upon-evidence of a continuing oppression and poverty, or concealment. This, cause has certainly in
it circumstances to raise dimculties. Eleanor Pye married within
two years, and died within five after the conveyance was made; and
the complainants were at her death, (and so continued until they
sued,) infants. Yet I think no account should have been,.ordered,
nor the conveyance impeached, after the lapse of twenty years,

JANUARY TERM, 1838.

and after George Jenkins's death; and concur that the bill be dismissed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden in aind for the county of Alexandria; an I was argued by
counsel. On consideration whereof, it is decreed and ordered by
this Court, that the decree of the said circuit court in this cause be,
