WHITE ET AL. v.

LUNING.

[Sup. Ot.

In the present case, the county, by an order in writing made
on the sixth day of October, 1871, expressly agreed, for reasons satisfactory to itself, to extend the time of completing
the road from the twenty-seventh day of December, 1871, to the
wit, on
first day of February, 1872. Before that time, -to
the nineteenth day of January, 1872,- it declared the road to
be completed to its satisfaction, delivered its bonds to the company, and received its stock in return, which it still holds and
owns. That this constitutes a waiver and an estoppel, which
under ordinary circumstances would prevent the obligor from
raising the objection that the contract had not been performed
in time, the authorities leave no doubt. Mudler v. Ponder,

WHITE

T AL. v. LUNING.

1. The rule that monuments, natural or artificial, rather than courses and distances, control in the construction of a conveyance of real estate, will not
be enforced, when the instrument would be thereby defeated, and when
the rejection of a call for a monunent would reconcile other parts of the
description, and leave enough to identify the land.
2. So far as it relates to the description of the property conveyed, the rule of
construction is the same, whether the deed be made by a party in his own
right or by an officer of the court.

E RaoR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of California.
This was an action of ejectment by the defendant in error
to recover the possession of certain lands situate in Santa Cruz
County, Cal., being a part of the rancho Sal Si Puedes, and
containing 1,0211 acres.

Oct. 1876.]

WHITE ET AL. v.

LUNING.

By written stipulation of the parties, the case was tried by
the court, which found the following facts :First, That the rancho Sal Si Puedes lies partly in the county
of Santa Cruz and partly in the county of Santa Clara, and was
finally surveyed and patented to the claimants, of whom the
said White was one, in the ycar 1861.
Second, On the eleventh day of April, 1866, said White
was the owner of certain portions of the said Sal Si Puedes
rancho, and, as such owner, mortgaged the same to the plaintiff
herein.
Third, An action was afterwards commenced by the plaintiff
herein, in the District Court of the Third Juldicial District of
the State of California for the county of Santa Cruz, against
the said White and other defendants, to foreclose said mortgage;
and such proceedings were duly had therein, that on the eleventh
day of April, 1866, a judgment of foreclosure and sale was
entered therein,.whereby, among other things, it was decreed
that the mortgaged premises should. be sold at public sale by
the sheriff of Santa Cruz County, and the proceeds of such sale
should be piaid over to the plaintiff therein. The premises in
controversy were embraced in said mortgage, and in the lands
directed to be sold by said decree.
Fourth, That afterwards the said White directed the said
sheriff to sell said mortgaged premises in parcels, one of
which parcels contained 1,0211 acres; and said sheriff thereupon, in obedience to said judgment and said directions
of said White, on the twentieth day of August, 1866, duly
sold said premises in parcels, and at said sale the plaintiff became the purchaser of three of said parcels for the sum of
$15,600, the other parcels being sold to other purc'hasers;
which parcels are not separately described in the -decree and
order of sale, but are embraced in the description therein set
forth.
Fifth, That afterwards, and in pursuance of said sale, on thetwenty-seventh day of February, 1867, the time for redemption
from said sale having elapsed, Albert Jones, sheriff of the
county of Santa Cruz. executed, acknowledged, and delivered
to the plaintiff his sheriff's deed, wherein it was recited that
by a certain judgment of foreclosure and sale, entered in the

WHITE FT AL. V. LUNING.

[Sup. Ct.

District Court of the Third Judicial District of the State of
California in and for the county of Santa Cruz, in the action
of Nicholas Luning, plaintiff, against William F. White, Frances
J. White, Eugene Casserly, and Nicholas McCarty, defendants,
on the eleventh day of April, 1866, the, said sheriff was commanded to sell at public auction, according to law, to satisfy
the said judgment, amounting to $23,968.69, and interest and
costs of suit, and expenses of sale.
That in pursuance of a certified copy of the order of sale,
duly delivered to the said sheriff, he duly advertised, and sold
at public auction, on the twentieth day of August, 1866, at
twelve o'clock noon, to the highest bidder, for cash, three
several parcels of land to the plaintiff for the sum of $15,600,
lie being the highest and best bidder therefor, and delivered to
him a certificate of sale, as required by law; that the time
allowed by law for redemption expired without redemption
having been made; that said sheriff, in pursuance of said
judgment and of the statute in such case made and provided,
for the consideration of $15,600 granted and conveyed to the
plaintiff the said three parcels of land firstly, secondly, and
thirdly described in said deed.
That the premises sought to be recovered in this action are
described in said deed as one of said parcels, as follows :"All that tract of land situate in the county of Santa Cruz, being
part of the rancho Sal Si Puedes, beginning at a post, marked ' S,'
which stands in the old fences on the south boundary of the land
of V. F. White, S. 46'.E. 6 rTOchains, from the cast line of White's
valley partition ; thence, by true meridian (magnetic variation, 15'
30' E.), along said fence and on said line of partition the following courses: S.460 30, E. 20T%7] chains, S. 60' 30' E. 4T%' chains,

thence along said pasture fence the following courses : S. 340 20'
chains,
E. 11IA chains, S. 100 E. 3T % chains, S. 27.0 W. 4 T
S. 400 W. 2f% chains, S. 65' 50' W. 4,9% chains, S. 471 ° AV.4 T ,chains, S. 72P, WT. 10-fW' chains, S. 891' W. 5-JW chains, S. 650 W.
11-7?, chains, to a post marked S, from which a forked red oak,
12 inches in diameter, marked 'B. T.,' bears S. 650 W., distant 38
links; thence S. 470 42' E. 50
chains, to a post on the south side
of a ravine, and thence S. 410 37' E. 17?%h chains to the place of
beginning, containing 1,0211 acres."
Sixth, That the post marked " S," being the point of beginning mentioned in said deed, the fence along the line of
partition, the mountains, the pasture fence, the forked red oak
marked "B. T.," the post on the south side of a ravine, all of
which are called for in said deed, are all well known and
existing monuments, and are all within the county of Santa
Cruz. That the said partition fence does not run to or in the
direction of either the north boundary of the rancho Sal Si
Puedes or the mountains, but runs nearly parallel thereto, and
that the course N. 471-0 E. 127 chains is not the course of such
partition fence, but is nearly at right angles thereto. That the
summit of the first range of mountains is the northerly boundary
line between said county of Santa Cruz and said county of
Santa Clara, and said summit and said county line are about
the distance of 127 chains from the point in said, fence where
the course N. 471-° E. begins, and in the direction of said
course.
That the northerly boundary of said rancho Sal Si Puedes is
not in the county of Santa Cruz, but in the county of Santa
Clara, on another range of mountains, about three-quarters of
a mile beyond the summit of said first range of mountains, and
beyond the said county line situate thereon in the same (northerly) direction.
That leaving said fence at the point where the course
N. 47F- E. 127 chains begins, and running thence the said
course and distance, and all the remaining courses and distances
as laid down in said deed, but rejecting the words of the call
at the end of said course, " the north boundary of the rancho
Sal Si Puedes on," and, " along said north boundary," and
changing the last course of the description from S. 41' 37' E.,

518

WHITE rT AL. v. LUNING.

[Sup. Ct.

so as to make it read S. 410 371 W. 17-,-h chains to the place
of beginning; all other calls, monuments, courses, and distances
in said deed completely harmonize, and the lines enclose a tract
of land containing 1,0211 acres of land situate entirely within
the county of Santa Cruz, being the quantity of land called for
in said sheriff's deed, and the same tract of land sued for in
this action; or, in other words, if, from the point of beginning,
the courses and distances of said description contained in said
sheriff's deed, being the field-notes of the survey, are followed
from the point of beginning, changing east into west in the last
course, the lines would close, embracing. the said lands, and
would correspond with all the other calls and monuments
mentioned in the deed, except that there would be a departure
at nearly right angles from the fence at the beginning of the
call N. 47_ ° E. 127 chains, and the lines would not extend to,
or in any manner correspond with, the north boundary of the
ranclhq Sal Si Puedes.
Seventh, That if the course N. 47-Y E. should be continued
some three-quarters of a. mile beyond the 127 chains called for
in the "dked, to the north boundary of the rancho Sal Si Puedes,
and from that point the remaining courses and distances be run
according to the calls in the gaid sheriff's deed, the line so run
would not follow the jnorth line of the rancho other than its
general course, nor touch*the partition fence, nor correspond
with any of the other subsequent calls named in the deed, nor
would the lines close, nor would they enclose the land sued for,
nor the quantity called for in the deed.
Eighth, That if from the point at the end of the course
N. 47-P E. 127 chains the remaining courses and distances
should be run as laid down in the said sheriff's deed to the
point of beginning of the course "S 461 W. 77.76 chains to
tlre pasture fence," the said line would run along the summit of
the said first mountain range in the same general direction
of the county line, but would not follow it; utnning thence the
hst-named course and distance, the partition fence would be
reached, not in the general course of the county line, but. in a
course nearly at right angles to the general course of said
county line. The pasture fence, and all calls, other than these
herein in the sixth and ninth findings named as excepted and

Oct. 1876.]

WHITE ET AL. V.

LUNING.

rejected, would be reached by following the courses and distances called for in the said sheriff's deed.
Ninth, That all the calls in the said description- cannot be
harmonized so as to enclose the premises sought to be recovered, nor any other land; that the call for continuing the line
along White's valley partition fence beyond the point where
the call for course and distance is " N. 47 OE.," is repugnant
and inconsistent; that the call for the northern boundary of
the rancho Sal Si Puedes on the mountains is false and mistaken; that the calls to run along that northern boundary
till the pasture fence is reached is alike false and mistaken;
that without rejecting each of the said false, mistaken, and
repugnant calls, the description will not enclose the land in
controversy.
That afterwards the defendants entered upon and oustedthe plaintiff from said land, and at the commencement of this
action were and are still in possession thereof, without any
title thereto whatsoever.
The court further found as conclusions of law,-First,That the said false, mistaken, and repugnant calls in
these findings mentioned should be rejected from the said
description, and the calls for courses and distances from the
starting-point be adopted as descriptive of the lands conveyed
by said sheriff's deed, rejecting the said false, mistaken, and
repugnant calls therefrom.
Second, That by virtue of said sale and sheriff's deed the
title to the land described in the plaintiff's complaint became, and still is, vested in fee-simple absolute in the plaintiff
herein, and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this
action the land and premises described in the complaint by
courses and distances, rejecting from the description in the
said sheriff's deed the said false, mistaken, and repugnant calls,
together with his costs of suit.
The court thereupon gave judgment for the plaintiff.
The defendants thereupon sued out this writ, and assign for
error in this court the action of the court below in admitting
the s eriff's deed to prove title to the land sued for.
The description of- the premises as furnished to the sheriff
and that contained in the complaint is as follows: -

The accompanying map indicates the position of the land in
controversy.
The case was argued by 11fr. Montgomery Blair for the plaintiffs in error.
A sheriff's deed is strictly construed, and no property passes
by it which is not described with reasonable certainty. Alason
v. White, 11 Barb. 173 ; Bector v. Hart,7 Mo. 531; Clemens
v. Raunells, 34 id. 579.
Every part-of the description in such a deed must be read
and satisfied with reasonable certainty, and no part of it
can be rejected for its falsity. 19 N. H. 290 ; 22 Wis. 167 ;
1 N. H. 93; Raymond v. Longworth, 14 How. 76; Dyke v. Lewis,
2 Barb. 344 ; Tallman v. White, 2 Comst. 66 ; Jackson v. -DeLaney, 11 Johns. (N. Y.) 367; Jackson v. Josevelt, 13 id. 97.
Hence, a description in which the calls cannot be harmonized, and in which several of the calls for monuments and one
for courses must ba rejected to enclose the land, has not the
certainty required by law.
A sheriff's deed does not, like a deed inter partes, admit of
the consideration of extraneous circumstances to arrive at its
intent. Its intent must be found in its terms; and, if they are
contradictory, it is void, unless the circumstances are such as to
entitle the grantee to have the deed reformed.

WHITE ET AL. V.

LUNING.

[Sup. Ct.

The proceeding to reform it is, in its nature, an equitable
one, in which the relief and the grounds upon which it is asked
must be stated in the pleadings. In the. absence of such a
prayer, even if the proof showed a case for equitable relief, it
would be error in the court to grant it, either directly by
decree reforming the deed, or in effect by rejecting calls found
to be false, mistaken, and repugnant.
'No case for equitable relief is shown. There is no proof that
it was actually made known that the land in question was the
land offered for sale, or that it was a fair sale, or that any thing
at all was paid for it.
lrf. William Henry Bawle for the defendant in error.
In cases of deeds interpartes, erroneous descriptions will be
rejected to conform to the true intent of the deed. Brown v.
Huger, 21 how. 306; Howe v. Bass, 2 Mass. 380; Penman v.
Wead, 6 id. 132; Caldwell v. Holder, 40 Penn. 168; Lodqe
v. Barnet, 46 id. 477; Flarterv. Picot, 33 Mo. 490; .fellogy v.
Muller, id. 571; Park v. Pratt,38 Vt. 545.
In the case of conflicting monunents, the rule of law is, that
the courses and distances are evidence of the true description ;
and where it appears from the deed that a monument is erroneously inserted, it will be rejected. Shipp v. Miller, 2 Wheat.
316; Barelay v. Howell, 6 Pet. 511; Atkinson v. Cummins,
9 How. 485; Noonan v. Lee, 2 Black, 504; -Davis v. Bainsford, 17 Mass. 207; Thatcher v. Howland, 2 Met. (Mlass.) 41;
Park v. Loomis, 6 Gray (Mass.), 472; Bosworth v. Shutsvort,
2 Cush. (Mass.) 393; Hamilton v. Ploster, 45 Me. 40; E-vans
v. areene, 21 Mo. 481; Gibson v. Bogy, 28 id. 481; Bass v.
Mitchell, 22 Texas, 285; Browning v. Atkinson, 37 id. 633;
Bagley v. lMorrill, 46 Vt. 99.
It is obvious that when the reason ceases for making monuments control, the rule also ceases; and, afortiori,where, as in
this case, all the courses and four subsequent boundaries harmonize, one conflicting boundary will be rejected.
The expression of the quantity of land contained in the deed
is very material. Kirkland v. Way, 3 Rich. 4; ifann v. Pearson, 2 Johns. 37; Puller v. Caw, 33 N. J- 157; 1 Greenl. on Ev.

MR. JusTicE DAvIS delivered the opinion of the court.

This is the case of a mortgagor unable to pay his debt, and
getting it satisfied by a judicial sale of the mortgaged premises, who, on the ground that no title passed by reason of misdescription in the deed of the sheriff, seeks to prevent his creditor,
who purchased them, from recovering possession. And this, too,
when, if there be any misdescription, it was presumably caused
by him, as they were offered for sale in parcels, by his direction and for his advantage. As the court does not find that
the descriptive errors misled any person, or caused any sacrifice
of the property, the presumption is, that no one was injured,
and that the property brought a full price. Obviously, therefore, there are no merits in this defence. It rests alone on the
idea that sheriffs' deeds and ordinary deeds inter partes are
subject to different rules of construction. In regard, however,
to the description of the. property conveyed, the rules are the
same, "Whether the deed be made by a party in his own right,
or by an officer of the court. The policy of the law does not
require courts to scrutinize the proceedings of a judicial sale
with a view to defeat them. On the contrary, every reasonable intendment will. be made in their favor, so as to secure, if
it can be done consistently with legal rules, the object they
were intended to accomplish. Is this deed void for uncertainty
of description, or can the property intended to be conveyed be

WHITE ET AL. V. LUNING.

[Sup. Ct.

reasonably located by means of that description ? The court
below located it by adopting, except in one instance, the calls
for courses and distances, and rejecting as false and repugnant
certain calls for known objects. It is true, that, as a general
rule,'monuments, natural or artificial, referred to in a deed control, on its construction, rather than courses and distances; but
this rule is not inflexible. 'It yields whenever, taking all the
particulars of the deed together, it would be absurd to apply it.
For instance, if the rejection of a call for a monument would
reconcile other parts of the description, and leave enough to
identify and render certain the land which the sheriff intended
to convey,- it would certainly be absurd to retain the false call,
and thus defeat the conveyance.
Greenleaf, in his Treatise on Evidence (vol. L sect. 301), in
speaking .on this subject, in effect says, That where the description in the deed is true in part, but not ti.ue in every particular,
so much of it as is false is rejected, and the instrument will
take effect if a sufficient description remains to ascertain its
application. Applying this rule to the subjeft-matter of this
deed, we do not think -there is any difficulty in reaching the
conclusion that the description is sufficiently certain to pass the
title to the land.
The court below found, among other things, that if the
courses and distances, being the field-notes of the survey, are
followed from the point of beginning, changing east into west
in the last course, the lines would, by closing, embrace the tract
of land sued for, and correspond with all the other calls and
monuments mentioned in the deed, except thaf there would be
a departure at nearly right angles from the partition fence at
the beginning of the call N. 47 -0 E. 127 chains, and the lines
would not .extend to, nor in any manner correspond with, the
north boundary of'the rancho Sal Si Puedes. There are, therefore, three descriptive errors, which, if removed from the deed,
would harmonize all other particulars in it, and leave enough
words of description to identify the demanded premises.
These errors will be noticed in the order stated by the court.
The deed closes with these words: " and thence S. 410 371 E.
17.32 chains to the place of beginning." This distance was
correct, and so, except in one prticular, was the course. It

should have been west instead of east. To follow the course as
given would manifestly not close the lines of the survey ; and
as, other things being equal, boundaries prevail over courses,
the court rejected the latter and adopted the former as the true
description in this particular. This was so obviously right, that
further comment is unnecessary.
The next error relates to the " fence along the line of partition."
There is a call for this fence as a boundary during the running of seven courses; but it is plainly a false call, after the
sixth course has been run, for the seventh course departs at
nearly right angles from the line of the fence, and if this course
be rejected and the call for the fence retained, none of the
other calls in the deed can be complied with, and the instrument is wholly unintelligible. On the contrary, if this course
be accepted as the true description, and the call for the fence
be discarded at the termination of the sixth course, there is
no difficulty of harmonizing the other parts of the deed, with
the exception of the northern boundary, and the difficulty
there, we think, can be easily removed. It would therefore be
manifestly wrong, not to say absurd, to retain the call for the
fence, and reject the call for the course and distance. The
reason why monuments, as a general thing, in the determination of boundaries control courses and distances, is, that they
are less liable to mistakes ; but the rule ceases with the reason
for it. If they are inconsistent with the calls for other monuments, and it is apparent from all the other particulars in the
deed that they were inadvertently' inserted, the reason for
retaining them no longer exists, and they will be rejected as
false and repugnant. This applies with equal if not greater
force to the last and main error in this deed. Adopting the
seventh course as the true description, the calls in the deed
proceed as follows : "N. 47F ° E. 127 chains to the north boundary of the rancho Sal Si Puedes on the mountains, thence
along said north boundary the following courses," &c.
The calls for these boundaries are equally false and mistaken
with the call for continuing the line along the partition fence,
as is clearly shown in the findings of fact by the court below.
There are two ranges of mountains in the direction of the

WHITE ET AL. V. LUNING.

[Sup. Ct.

course N. 47-- E. The summit of the first range is the northerly boumdary line between the counties of Santa Cruz and
Santa Clara, and both the summit and county line are about
the distance of 127 chains from the point in the partition fence
where the course N. 47-1o E. begins.
There is another range of mountains in the same northerly
direction, in the county of Santa Clara, about three-quarters of
a mile beyond the summit of the first range, and the northerly boundary of the rancho Sal Si Puedes is on this range of
mountains.
The calls for courses and distances run along the summit of
the first range, and do not apply to the second. Besides this,
if the summit of the first be treated as the boundary intended
to be called for, all other calls, monuments, courses, and distances in the deed completely harmonize, except the two
descriptive errors which have already been corrected, and the
lines enclose a tract of the precise number of acres sued for,
lying wholly within the county of Santa Cruz. But if the call
for "the north boundary of the rancho" be retained as the true
description, there is not only conflict with all the remaining
courses and distances, but all the subsequent monuments mentioned in the deed, and the lines would not enclose the land in
controversy, nor, indeed, any other. With all these facts to
rest upon, is not the conclusion irresistible, that the words of
the call at the end of the course N. 47- ° E. 127 chains -to
vit,
"the north boundary of the rancho Sal Si Puedes on the mountains," and "along said boundary the following courses" - were
mistakenly inserted, and should be rejected? Rejecting them,
with the other particulars we have named, from the deed as
false and inconsistent with the other parts of the description
which are true, and of themselves sufficient to make a complete
instrument, we are able to give effect to this judicial sale,
according to the plain and manifest meaning of the officer who
had it in charge.
It is rare, where so many field-notes of the survey of an irregularly shaped tract of land are incorporated in a deed, that
there are so few mistakes. The courses and distances in this
deed are numerous, and are all correct, except the last; and
there the only error i%in the course, which is. easily corrected,

as the call is for the post where the survey begins. And these
courses and distances enclose the identical land in dispute. In
such a case, it would be wrong to let two false boundaries stand
in order to defeat a conveyance.
It is proper to remark that a map will accompany the report
of this case, so as to make this opinion intelligible.
Judgment affirmed.
HOiE INSURANCE CO-mPANY v. BALTIMORE WAREHOUSE
COMPANY.
1. A policy of insurance taken out by warehouse-keepers, against loss or damage
by fire on "merchandise, their own or- held by them in trust, or in which
they have an interest or liability, contained in" a designated warehouse,
covers the merchandise itself, and not merely the interest or claim of the
warehouse-keepers.
2. If the merchandise be destroyed by fire, the assured may recover its entire
value, not exceeding the sum insured, holding the remainder of the amount
recovered, after satisfying their own loss, as trustees for the owners.
3. Goods described in a policy as "merchandise held in trust" by warehousemen, are goods intrusted to them for keeping. The phrase, "held in trust,"
is to be understood in its mercantile sense.
4. A policy was taken out by warehousemen on "merchandise" contained in
their warehouses, "their own or held by them in trust, or in which they
have an interest or liability." Depositors of the merchandise, who received
advances thereon from the warehousemen, took out other policies covering
the same goods. Held, that the several policies constituted double insurance, and that they bear a loss proportionally.
5. In a case of contributing policies, adjustments of loss made by an expert may
be submitted to the jury, not as evidence of the facts stated therein, or
as obligatory, but for the purpose of assisting the jury in calculating the
amount of liability of the insurer upon the several hypotheses of fact mentioned in the adjustment, if they find either hypothesis correct.
6. What evidence may be submitted to a jury from vhich they may find a waiver
of preliminary proofs.
7. No part of a letter written as an offer of compromise is admissible in evidence.
