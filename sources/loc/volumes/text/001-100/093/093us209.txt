SHERMNAN v.

BUICK.

BuiCK.

1. Testimony, whether parol or documentary, which shows a want of power in
officers who issue a patent, is admissible in an action at law to defeat a title
set up under it. In such case, the patent is not merely voidable, but absolutely void ; and the party is not obliged to resort to a court of equity to
have it so declared.
2. In construing the act of March 8,1853 (10 Stat. 246), the court held : 1. School
sections sixteen and thirty-six, granted to the State of California by sect. 6
of the act, are also excepted from the operation of the pre-emption law to
2. The
- which,.by the same section, the public lands generally are subjected.
rule governing the right of pre-emption on school sections is provided by
the seventh section of the act; and it protects a settlement, i: the surveys,
when made, ascerta'n its location to lie on a school section. 3. In such
cae,the only right conferred on the State is to select other land in lieu
of that so occupied. 4. ,The proviso to the sixth section, forbidding preemption on unsurveyed lands aftei one year from the passage of the act,
is limited to the lands not excepted out of that section, and has no application to the school sections so excepted.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the State of California.

The plaintiff in error brought suit in the pro t er court of tl,e
State of California to recover po oession of a part of section bG,
township 5 south, range 1 ea .t, Mount Diablo meridian, and
asserted title T-ereto uider a patent from the United States,
bearing date May 15, 1869. The defendant claimed under a
patent from the State of California, of the date of Jan. 1, 1869.
The title of the State is supposed to rest on the act of Congress
of March &-,1853 (10 Stat. 246), granting to her, for school
purposes, with certain limitations, every sixteenth and thirtysixth section within -her boundaries, according to the surveys to
be thereafter made of the public lands.
The plaintiff,- in aid of his patent, and to defeat the title of.
the State under the act of 1853, offered to prove, that, as early
as Dec. 20, 1862, he had settled upon the land, and had ever
since resided on it; that it was npt surveyed until Aug. 11,
1866; that he had filed and proved his pre-emption claim to it
Nov. 6,1866; and paid for it, and received a patent certificate,
on vhich his patent, was duly issued.
,The court exomded this evidence, and gave judgment for the,
defendant, which -.vds affirmed by the Supreme Court; whereupon the plaintiff sued out this writ of error. The sections of

the act which bear upon the case are set forth in the opinion
of the court.
'Tr. Philip Philips, 11r. S. ilL Wilson, and iMir. George A.
Nourse, for the plaintiff in error.
1. It was competent for the plaintiff to show that the State,
at the date of her patent to the defendant, had -no title to the
lands in controversy. Polk's Lessee v. Wendell, 9 Cranch, 87;
Patterson v. Tinn, 11 Wheat. 381; Patterson v. Tatum,
Pacific Law Reporter, Oct. 6, 1874; Doll v. 2leader, 16 Cal.
295; Terry v.-MKegerle, 24 id. 609; Reichart v. Felps, 6 Wall.
160; Norton v. Nebraska, 21 id. 660.
2. The legal title to sections sixteen and thirty-six did not
vest in the State until they were marked out and defined by
survey. Until then the grant to her was in the nature of a
float. Mfiddleton v. Lowe, 30 Cal. 596; R-ailroad v. Fremont
County, 9 Wall. 94; Gaines v. Nicholson, 9 How. 356; Cooper
v. Roberts, 18 id. 173. The settlement of the plaintiff, having
been made before such survey, was within the exception contained in the seventh section of the act of 1853. The grant,
therefore, did not embrace the lands covered by that settlement,
and the patent of the State was an absolute nullity.
3. The intention .of Congress to protect pre-emption settlements made on school sections before such survey is clearly
manifested by the provision authorizing the State to select
other lands in lieu of those on which such settlements were
made.
.21r. Miontgomery Blair for the defendant in error.
1. The grant of sections sixteen and thirty-six was in prsenti.
No settlement on the lands in controversy having been made
by the plaintiff at the date of the act, or within one year thereafter, they were not excepted from the grant. Jfoughton v.
.iggins, 25 Cal. 255; -Dollv. ifeader, 16 id. 296; Van Volkenburg v. lMie Cleud, 21 id. 330; Summers v. -Diekinson,9 id. 554;

255; lVezerle v. Ashe, 27 id. 328; 38 id. 74; Rutherford v.
Greene, 2 -Wheat. 196.
2. Although a survey was required to identify these sections
by specific boundaries, a vested interest passed to the-State by

force of the act of 1853. The doctrine of relation has been
uniformly applied when executive acts, whether by survey or
patent, are required to give full effect to a grant. The title,
whenever they are completed, inures as of the date of the
inception of the grmnt, and defeats all intervening claims.
Landis v. Brant, 10 How. 373; K(issell v. The Public Schools,
18 id. 19 ; Cooper v. Roberts, id. 173 ; Ohouteau v. Gibson,
13 Wall. 92; lfaguire v. Tyler, 8 id. 650; Railroad Con2pany
v. Sm ith, 9 id. 95 ; V eder v. Guppy, 3 Wis. 502.
It is said, on the other side, that the grant does not attach to
the school sections till they are surveyed, because till then there
were no such sections. This proves too much. If the thing
granted did not exist, or was not described with certainty, the
grant would be void, which is not the argument. The thing
granted is the land, which did exist. " Section" is only a word
of description, but it is a certain and enduring description; and
a grant of a particular section is equally operative to appropriate
it, whether its lines have been already run, or are hereafter to
be run in the same manner, making the location only a question
of measurement and calculation. Hence the description is as
complete in the one case as in the other, and is so treated by
the law; for the grant applies in terms to the "surveyed and
to the unsurveyed land." As much violence is done to the
language by withholding the "unsurveyed " lands from the
schools as by denying them to pre-emptors.
3. Subsequent acts extending the permission to settle upon
unsurveyed lands have no bearing upon this case. They cannot operate to recall the grant of 1853, or impair the rights
which the State acquired under it. The government cannot
resume its grants. Are~w Orleans v. De Armas, 9 Pet. 224.
MR. JUSTICo9 MILLER, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court.
The contest in this case is between a patent of the United
States and a patent of the State of California. To determine.
which of them conveyed, under the facts offered in evidence,
the title to the land in controversy, a construction of the act
of 1853 is required. It is entitled "An Act to provide for the
survey of the public lands in California, the granting of pre-

SHERMAN V. BUICK.

[Sup. Ct.

emption rights therein, and for other purposes," and is the first
act of Congress which extended the land system of the United
States over the newly acquired territory of that State. It provided for surveys, for sales, 'for the protection of the rights of
settlers, miners, and others; and, among the other purposes
mentioned in the caption,, ford magnificent donations to the
State of lands for schools and for public buildings.
The sixth and seventh sections of the act are of chief importance in the matter under consideration; the preceding sections
having provided for surveying all the lands. The clause of the
sixth section, in which the grant to the State of the sixteenth
and thirty-sixth sections for school purposes is found, reads as
follows :
"All the public lqnds in the State of California, whether surveyed
or un surveyed, with the exception of sections sixteen and thirty-six,
which shall be, and hereby'arp, granted to the State for the purposes of public schools in each township; and, with the exception
of lands appropriated under this act, or reserved by competent
authority,'and excepting, also, the lands claimed under any foreign
grant or title, and the mineral lands, shall be subject to the preemption laws of the 4th of Septenber, 1841, vith all the exceptions,
conditions, and limitations therein, except as is herein otherwise
provided; and fall, after the plats thereof are returned to the
office of the register, be offered for sale, after six months' public
notice in the State of the time and place of Pale, under the laws,
rules, and regulations now governing such sales, or such as may be
hereafter prescribed."
Then come several provisos, which we will consider hereafter;
but we pause here to note the effect of this granting and excepting clause on the lands which should, by the future surveys of' the government, be found to be sections sixteen and
thirty-six.
It is obviously the main- purpose of the -section to declare,
that after the lands are surveyed they shall be subject to sale,
according to the general land system of the government; and,
secondly, to subject them to the right of pre-emption as defined
by the act of 1841, and. to extend that right tQ lands unsurveyed
as well as to those surveyed. But here it seemed. to occur to
the framer of the act, that California, like other States in which

Oct. 1876.]

SHERMAN

v.

BUICK.

public lands lay, ought to have the sixteenth and thirty-sixth
sections of each township for school purposes, and that they
should not be liable to the general pre-emption law, as other
public lands of the government would be. Ile accordingly
injected into the sentence the grant of these lands to the State,
and the exception of them from the operation of the pre-emption
law of 1841, together with other lands which in like manner
were neither to be sold nor made subject to pre-emption. These
were, lands appropriated under the authority of that act, or
reserved by competent authority; lands claimed under any
foreign grant or title (i.e., Mexican grants) ; and mineral lands.
All these were by this clause exempted from sale and from the
general operation of the pre-emption laws.
But the experience of the operation of our land system in
other States suggested that it might be ten or twenty, and
in some instances thirty, years before all the surveys would
be completed and the precise location of each school section
known. In the mean time, the State was rapidly filling up
by actual settlers, whose necessities required improvements,
which, when found to be located on a school section, should
have some protection. What it should be, and how the relative rights of the settler and of the State should be also
protected under these circumstances, is the subject of a distinct section of the act, - the one succeeding that we have just
considered.That section (7) provides: "That when any settlement, by
the erection of a dwelling-house, or the cultivation of any
portion of the land, shall be made upon the sixteenth and
thirty-sixth sections before the same - shall be surveyed, or when
such sections may be reserved for public uses, or taken by
private claims, other land shall be selected by the proper
authorities of the State in lieu thereof." That it was the
purpose of this section to provide a rule for the exercise of the
right of pre-emption to the school lands granted by the previous
section cannot be doubted. The reason for this is equally clear;
namely, that these lands were not only granted away by the
preceding section and inchoate rights conferred on the State,
but they were, with other classes of lands, by express terms
excepted out of the operation of the pre-emption laws which

SHERMAN v. BUICK.

[Sup. Ct.

it was a principal object of that section to extend to the public
lands of California generally.
Whether a settler on these school lands must have all the
qualifications required by the act of 1841, as being the head of
a family, a citizen of the United States, &c., or whether the
settlement, occupation, and cultivation must be precisely the
same as required -by that act, we need not stop to inquire. It
is very plain, that, by the seventh section, so far as related to the
date of the settlement, it was sufficient if it was found to exist
at the time the surveys were made which determined its locality;
and, as to its nature, that it was sufficient if it was by the
erection of a dwelling-house, or by the cultivation of any portion
of the land. These things being-found to exist when the survey
ascertained their location on a school section, the claim of the
State to that particular piece of land was at an end; and, being
shown in the proper mode to the proper officer of the United
States, the right of the State to that land was gone, and in lieu
of it she had acquired the right to select other land agreeably
to the act of 1826, subject to the approval of the Secretary of
the Interior,
But it is said that the right of pre-emption thus granted by
the seventh section was subject to the limitation prescribed by
the third proviso to the sixth section; namely, "that nothing
in"this act shall. be construed to authorize any settlement to be
m.'de on any pnblic lands not surveyed, unless the same be
made within one year from the -passage of this act; nor shall
any right of such-settler be recognized by virtue of any settlement or in~provement made of such unsurveyed lands subsequent to tha%day." And such was thd opinion of the Supreme
Court of California. , And that court, assuming this to be true,
further held, that the grant made by the act of the school sections was a present grant, vesting the title in the State to the
sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections absolutely, as fast as the
townships were surveyed and sectionized. Higgins v. Houghton, 25 Cal. 252. As a deduction from these premises, it held,
that the right to pre-emption on these lands expired with the
lapse of the year from the passage of the act, and that no subsequent act of Congress could revive or'extend it, even if it was
so intended.

Oct. 1876.]

SHERMAN

v. BuicK.

But we are of opinion that the first of this series of propositions is untenable.
The terms of the proviso to the sixth section, and those of
the seventh section, if to be applied to the same class of lands,
are in conflict with each other. The one says, that if settlement be made on land before the survey, which by that survey
is found to be on the sixteenth or thirty-sixth section, the settlement shall be protected. The other says, that no settlement
shall be protected unless made within one year after the passage of the act. In view of the well-known fact that none of
theie surveys would be completed under several years, the provision of the seventh section was a useless and barren concession to the settler, if to be exercised within a year, and, in the
history of land-titles in that State, would have amounted to
nothing. This apparent conflict is reconciled by holding to the
natural construction of the language and the reasonable purpose of Congress, by which the limitation of one year to the
right of pr.e-enption in the sixth section is applicable alone to
the general body of the public lands not granted away, and not
excepted out of the operation of the pre-emption law of 1841,
as the school lands were, by the very terms of the previous part
of the section; while sect. 7 is left to control the right of preemption to the school sections, as it purports to do.
:-In this view of the matter, the very learned argument of
counsel on-the question of the character of the grant as to the
time when the title vests in the State, and the copious reference to the acts of Congress and of the State, as authorizing
pre-emption after the expiration of one year from the date of
the statute, are immaterial to the issue. Actual settlement
before survey made accompanied the grant as a qualifying
limitation of the right of the State, which she was bound to
recognize when it was found to exist, and for which she was
authorized to seek indemnity in another quarter. There is,
therefore, no necessity for any additional legislation by Congress
to secure the pre-emption right as to school sections, and no
question as to whether it has so legislated, or whether such
legislation would be valid; and we do not enter on those questions.
No question is made in the argument here, none seems to

SHERMAN V. BUICK.

[Sup. Ct.

have been made in the Supreme Court of the State, and none
is to be found in its opinion in the case, as to the admissibility
of the rejected testimony, if the fact which it sought to establish could be recognized by the court. Nor do we think such
objection, if made, is sustainable. The testimony offered does
not go to impeach or contradict the patent of the United States,
or vary its meaiing. Its object was to show that the State
of California, when she made her conveyance of the land to
defendant, had no title to it; that she never had; and that by
the terms of the act of Congress, under which she claimed, the
only right she ever had in regard to this tract was to seek other
land in lieu 6f it. The effect of the evidence was to show that
the title set up by defendant under the State was void, - not
merely voidable, but void ab initio. For this purpose, it was
competent, and it was sufficient; for it showed, that when the
survey was actually made, and the land in question was found
to be part of section thirty-six, plaintiff had nade a settlement
on it, within the meaning of the seventh section of the act of
1853, and the State could do nothing but seek indemnity "i
other land.
It has always been held, that an absolute want of power to
issue a .patent could be shown in a court of law to defeat a title
set up under it, though where it is merely yoidable the party
may be compelled to resort to a court of equity to have it so
declared. Stodard v. Ohamberq, 2 How. 317; Easton v. Salisbury, 21 id. 426 ; Reichart v. Peips, 6 Wall. 160.
