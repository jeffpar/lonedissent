Jan. 31st.

THIS cause was argued by Mr. Jones for the plainotlf in
error, and by Mr. Coxe for the defendant in error

Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This is a case of bail, and is to be decided by the principles of English law, which the case finds constitute also the
law and practice of Maryland on the subject. According to
these pnndiples, the allowance of the bail to surrender the
principal after the return of a ca. sa. is considered as a matter of favour and indulgence, and not of right, and is regulated by the acknowledged practice of the Court. To many
purposes, the-bail is considered as fixed by the return of the
ca. sa. But the Courts allow the bail to surrender the principal within a limited period after the return of the scirefaczas'against them, as matter of favour, and not as matter
pleadable in bar. In certain cases even a formal surrender
has not -been required, where the principal was still living,
aid capable of being surrendered, and an exoneretur.would
be entered, and the principal discharged immediately upon
the surrender. But the rule has tiever been applied to cases
where the principal dies before the return.of the scirefac2as.
In such a case, the bail is considered as fixed by the return
of the ca. sa., and his death afterwards, .and before the return of the sctrefacias, does not entitle the bail to an exoneretur. The plea is. therefore, bad, and the judgment is affirmed, with .six per centun damages, and costs.
