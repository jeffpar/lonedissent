[CO11STITUtTowAL LAw.]
The authority to decide whether the exigencies contemplated in the
Constitution of the United States, and the act of Congress of
.1795, ch. 101. in which the President has authority to call forth
the militia, "to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions," have arisen, is exclusively vested in the
President, and his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.
Although a militia man, who refused to obey. the orders of the President, calling him into the public service under the act of 1795, is
not, m the sense of that act, "employed in the service of the United States," so as to be subject to the rules and articles of war;
yet he is liable to be tried for the offence under the 5th section of
the same act, by a Court Martial called under the authority of the
United States.
Where, in an action of replevin, the defendant, being a Deputy Marshal of the United States, avowod and justified the taking the
plamtiff'a goods, by virtue of a warrant issued to the Marshal of
the District, to collect a fine imposed on him by the judgment of a
Court Martial, described as a General Court Martial composed of

thence until the 25th of December, 1814, there was public and open war between the United States of America,
and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and
its dependencies, and the citizens and subjects of the said
countries respectively; and that during the continuance of
the said war, to wit, on the 4th day of August 1814; and

either the partiwulars or substance of the said orders of the
Governor of the State of New-York, in the said avowry

Mr. Justice STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is a writ of error to the judgment of the Court for
the Trial of Impeachments and the Correction of Errors
of the State of New-York, being the highest Court of that
State, and is brought here in virtue of the 25th section of
the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20. The original action
was a replevin for certain goods and chattels, to which the
original defendant put in an avowry, and to that avowry
there was a demurrer, assigning nineteen distinct and special causes of demurrer. Upon a joinder in demurrer, the
Supreme Court of the State gave judgment against the
avowant, and that judgment was affirmed by the high Court
to which the present writ of error is addressed.
The avowry, in substance, asserts a justification of the
taking of the goods and chattels to gatisfy a fine and forfeiture imposed upon the original plaintiff by a Court Martial, for a failure to enter the service of the United States as
a militia-mifn, when thereto required by the President of
the United States, in pursuance of the act of the 281! of
F ebruary, 1795, c. 101. It is argued that this avowry is
defective, both in substance- and form, and it will be our
business to discuss -the most material of these objections;
and as to others, of which no articular notice is taken, itis
to be understood that the Court are of opinion, that they.
are either unfounded in fact or in 1 ..w, and do not require
any separate examination.
For the more clear and exact consideration of the subject, it may. be necessary to refer to the constitution of the
United States, and some of the provisions of the act of
1795. The constitution declares that Congress shall have
power." to provide for calling forth the militia, to execute
he laws of the Union., suppress insurrections,and repel in-

In pursuance of this authority, the act of 1795 has provided,
"that whenever the United States shall be invaded, oyr be

Indian tribe, it shall be lawful for the President of the Urnted States to call forth such number of the militia of the
State or States most convenient to &ie place of danger, or
scene of action, as he may judge necessary to repel such
invasion, and to issue his order for that purpose to such officer or officers of the militia as he shall think proper." And
like provisions are made for the other cases stated in the
constitution. It has not been denied here, that the act of Tho act o.

won, that the authority to decide whether the exigency has
arisen, belongs exclusively to the President. and that his decisibn is conclusive upon all other persons.,- We think that
this coi~struction necessarily results from the nature of the
power itself,.and from the ynanifest object contemplated by
the act of Cbngress: The power itself is to be exercised.
upon sudden emergencies, upon great occasions of state,
and under circumstances which may be vital to the existence
of the Union. A prompt and unhesitating obedience to
orders is indispensable to the complete attainment of the
object. The service is a military service, and the command -of a military nature; and in such cases, every delay,
and every obstacle to an efficient and immediate compliance, necessarily tend to jeopard the public interests.
While subordinate officers or soldiers are pausing to consider
whether they ought to obey, or are scrupulously weighing
the evidence of the facts upon which the. commander ii
c ief exercises the right to demand their services, the hostile
enterprise may be accomplished without the means of resistance. If" the power of regulating the militia, and of
commanding its. services in times of insurrection and inva.
sion, are (as it has been emphatically said they are) natural
incidents to the duties ofsupenntending the common defence,
and of wathing over the internal peace of the confederacy,"4 these powers must be so construed as to the modes of
their exercise as not to defeat the.great end in view. If a
superior officer has a right to contest the orders, of the President upon his own,doubts as to the exigency having, arisen,
it must be equally the right of every inferior officer and
soldier; and any act done by any person in furtherance of
such orders would subject him to responsibility in a civil
suit, in which his defence must finally rest upon his ability
to establish the facts by competent proofs. Such a course

'would be subversive of all discipline, and expose the best
disposed officers to the chances of ruinous litigation. Besides, in many instances, the evidence upon which the President might decide that there is imminent danger of iavasion, might be of a nature not constituting strict technical
proof, orthe disclosure of the evidence might reveal important secrets of state, which the public interest, and even
safety, might imperiously demand to be kept in conceal.
ment.
If we look at the language of the act of 1795, every conclision drawn from the nature of the power itself, is strongly
fortified. The words are, " whenever the United States
shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion, &c.
it shall be lawful for the President, &c. to call forth such
number of the militia, &c. as he may judge necessary to
repel such invasion." The power itself is confided to the
Executive of the Union, to him who is, by the constitution,
" the commander in chief of the militia, when called into
the actual service of the United States," whose duty it is to
"take care that the laws be faithfully executed," and whose
reiponsibility for an honest discharge of his official obligations is secured by the highest sanctions. He is necessarily
constituted the judge of the existence of the exigency in
the first instance, and is bound to act according to his belief
of tbhe facts. If he does so act, and decides to call forth the
militia, his orders for this purpose are in strict conformity
with the provisions of the law; and it would seem to follow
as i necessary consequence, that every act done by a subordinate officer, in obedience to such orders, is equally justifiable. The law contemplates that, under such circumstances, orders shall be given-to carry the power into effect;
and it cannot therefore be a correct iiference that any other
person has a just right to disobey them. The law does not
provide for any appeal from the judgment of the President,
or for any right in subordinate officers to review his decision,
and in effect defeat it. Whenever a statute gives a discretionry power to any person, to be exercised by him upon
his own opinion of certain facts: it is a sound rule of con-

struction, that the statute constitutes him the sole and exclusive judge of the existence of those facts. And, in the present case, we are all of opinion that strch is the true con-

struction of the act of 1795. It is no answer that such a
power may be abused, for there is-no power which is not
susceptible of abuse. The remedy for this, as well as for
all other official misconduct, if it should occur, is to be
found in the constitution itself. In a free government, the
danger must be remote, since in addition to the high qualit.es which the Executive must be presumed to possess, of
public virtue, and honest devotion to the public interests.
..he frequency of elections, and the watchfulness of the representativeg of the nation, carry with them all the checks
which can be useful to guard against usurpation or wanton
tyranny
This doctrine has not been seriously contested upon the
present occasion. It was indeed maintained and approved
by the Supreme Court of New York, in the case of Vanderheyden v. Young, (11 Johns. Rep. 150.) where the reasons
in support of it were most ably expounded by Mr. Justice
Spencer, in delivering the opinion of the Court.
But it is now contended, as it was contended in that case,
that notwithstanding the judgment of the President is conclusive as to the existence of the exigency, and may be
given in evidence as conclusive proof thereof, yet that the
avowry is fatally defective, because it omits to aver that the
fact did exist. The argument is, that the power confided to
the President is a limited power, and can be exercised 6nly
it is not neces- ini the cases pointed out in the statute, and therefore. it is
eary in such a
case that it necessary to aver the facts which bring the exercise within
of the statute. In short, the same principles

the Union. It is not necessary to aver, that the act which
he may rightfully do, was so done. If the fact of the existence of the exigency were averred, it would be traversable, and of course might be passed upon by a jury; and thus
the legality of the orders of the President would depend,
not on his own judgment of the facts, but upon the finding
of those facts upon the proofs submitted to a jury. This
view of the objection is precisely the same which was acted
upon by the Supreme Court of New-York, if the case already referred to, and, in the opinion of this Court, with
entire legal correctness.

The great doubt in that case was, whether the dewas liable to be tried for the offence by a Court
Martial organized under State authority.
Objection to In the next place, it is said, the Court Martial was not
the avowry,
that the Court composed of the proper number of officers required by
noartial wselaw. In order to understand the force of this objection, it
of the number is necessary to advert to the terms of the act of 1795, and
of officers renuired bylaw, the rules and articles of war. The act of 1795 (s. 5.) pro-,
vides, "that every officer. non-commissioned officer, or private of the militia, who shall fail to obey the orders of the
President of the United States," &c. shall forfeit a sum not
exceeding one year's pay, and not less than one month's pay,
to be determined and adjudged by a Court Martial." And
it further provides, (s. 6.) " that Courts Martial for the
trial of militia shall be composed of militia officers only.."
These are the only provisions in the act on this subject. It
is not stated by whom the Courts Martial shall be called,
nor in what manner, nor of what number they shall be
composed. But the Court is referred to the 64th and 65th
of the rules and articles of war, enacted by the act of 10th
of April, 1806; ch. 20., which provide, "that General
Courts Martial may consist of any number of comnmission.
ed officers from five to thirteen inclusively; but they shall
not consist of less than thirteen, where that number can be
convened without manifest injury to the service -" and that
"any general officer commanding an army, or colonel commanding a separate department, may apppint General
Courts Martial when necessary." Supposing these clauses
applicable to the Court Martial in question, it is very clear,

that the act is merely directory to the officer appointing the

Court, and that his decision as to the number which can be Martin

matter submitted to his sound discretion, must be conclusve. But the present avowry goes further, and alleges,
not only that the Court Martial was appointed by a general
officer commanding an army, that it was composed of militia officers, naming them, but it goes on to assign the reason
why a number short of thirteen composed the Court, in the
very terms of the 64th article; and the truth of this allegation is admitted by the demurrer. Tried, therefore, by the
very test which has been resorted to in support of the objection, it utterly fails.
But, in strictness of law, the propriety of ibis resort may it isnot necessary that

the act of 1795, is to be composed of the same number of
officers, 6rganized in the same manner as these rules and
articles contemplate for persons in actual service. If any
resort is to be bad to them, it can only be to guide the discretion of the officer ordering the Court, as matter of
usage, and not as matter of positive institution. If, then,
there be no mode pointed out for the formation of the Court
Martial in these cases, it may be asked, in what manner is
such Court to be appointed 7 The answer is, according to
the general usage of the military service, or what may not
unfitly be called the customary military law. It is by the
same law that 'Courts Martial, when duly organized, are
bound to execute their duties, and regulate their modes of
proceeding. in the absence of positive enactments. Trpor

any other principle, Courts Martial would be left without
adequate means to exercise the authority confided to
them. for there could scarcely be framed a positive code

to provide for the infinite variety of incidents applicable to
them.
The act of the 18th of April, 1814, ch. 141. which expired at the end of the late war, was, in a great measure, intended to obviate difficulties arising from the imperfection
of the provisions of the act of 1795, and especially to aid
Courts Martial in exercising jurisdiction over cases like the
present. But whatever may have been the legislative intention, its terms do not extend to the .deciaration of the
number of which such Courts Martial shall be composed.
The first section provides, " that Courts Martial to be composed of militia officers alone, for the trial of militia drafted,
detached, and called forth, (not or called forth,) for the service of the United States, whether acting in con3unctior
with the regularforces or otherwztse, shall, when necessary,
be appointed, held, and conducted, In the manner prescribed
by the rules and articles of war, for appointing, holding,
and conducting, Courts Martial for the trial of delinquents
in the army of the United States." This language is obviously confined to the militia in the actual service of the
United States, and does not extend to such as are drafted
and refuse to obey the call. So that the Court are driven
back to the act of 1795 as the legitimate source for the ascertainment of the organization and jurisdiction of the
Court Martial in the present case. And we are of opinion,
tha't nothing appears on the face of the avowry to lead to
any doubt that it was a legal Court Martial, organized according to military usage, and entitled to take cognizance
of the delinquencies stated in the avowry.

(s. 7.) that the fines assessed shall be certified by the presiding officer of the Court Martial to the marshal, for him

any farther sanction of the sentences. And if such an approval is to be deemed essential, it must be upon the general military usage, and not from positive institution. Either
way, we think that all has been done, which the act required.

confined in its operation to cases of refusal to obey the orders of the President in times of public war. On the contrary, that act authorizes the President to call forth the militia to suppress insurrections, and to enforce the laws of
the United States, in times of peace. And Courts Martial are, under the 5"h section of the act, entitled to take
cognizance of, and to punish delinquencies in such cases,
as well as in cases where the object is to , apel i ivasbon in

such limitation in the act itself.
The next objection to the avowry is, that the certificate

'thereby
MIartin

The sentence as.there set forth is. " and thereupon the said
General Court Martial imposed the sum of 96 dollars as a
fine on the said Jacob, for having.thus failed, neglected, and
refused to rendezvous and enter m the service of the United
State.%of America, when thereto required as aforesaid."
The certificate adds, "and that the said Jacob E. Mot, was
sentenced by the said Geheral Court Martial, on failure of
Ahe payment of said fine imposed on him, to twelve months
imprisonment." It is material to state that the averment
does not purport to set forth the sentence in hoc verba; nor
was it necessary in this avowry to allege any thing more
than that part of the sentence which imposed the fine, since
that was the sole ground of the justification of taking the"
goods and. chattels in controversy. But there is nothing repugnant in this averment to that which relates to the certificate. The latter properly adds the fact which respects
-the imprisonment, because the certificate constitutes the
warrant to the marshal for his proceeaings. The act-of
1795 expressly declai:es, that the delinquents "shall be liaX
ble to be imprisoned by a like sentence, on failure of paymdnt of the fines adjudged -against ihem, for one calendar
month for every five dollars of such fine."l If indeed it bad
been necessary to set forth the whole sentence at large, the
first omission-would be helped by the certainty of the subsequent averment There is, then, no variance or repugnance in these allegations; but they. may well stand together.
Of the remaining causes of special demurrer, some are
properly matters of defence before the Court Martial; and
its sentence being upon a subject within its jiurisdictioit, is
conclusive; and others turn upon niceties of.plbadng,.to
