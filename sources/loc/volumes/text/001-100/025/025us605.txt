Relief in equity ag.ainst a judgment at law, upon certain bonds given
for the indemnity of the obligee, as endoiser of notes drawn by
the obligor, the consideration having failed.
The assignee of such bonds takes tieni subject to all equities existing betweeni the original parties.

THIS cause was argued by Mr. Swann, for the appellants, Jan. ist,.
and by Mr. Taylor, for the respondents.
Mr. Justice THOMPSON delivered the opinion of the Jan. OtIh
Court.
This case comes up by appeal from the Circuit Court of
the District of Columbia for the county of Alexandria. The
object of the bill filed ii the Court below, was to obtain relief against a judgment at law recovered against Shreeve.
the appellee, upon certain bonds given by hii to Elisha
Janney, and which bonds had been assigned to the appellant.
Scott, as his trustee, for the benefit of his creditors.
In the progress of the cause, it was deemed necessary bk
the Court, that the Bank of Potomack should be made o

party defendant. A supplemental bill for that purpose was
accordingly filed, and the bank made a party.
The first inquiry that seems naturally to arise is, how the
case stood as between Shreeve and Jaimey, the original parties to the bonds. The material facts upon which the complainant in the Court below relied for relief, are not demcd
by the answer of Scott. From the bill and answver, and
exhibits in the caitse, accompanied by a written agreement
between the solicitors of the parties, before the cause u as
set down for argument, the leading facts in the case appear
to be, that some time in the year 1808, Shreeve failed ii
biisiMes, being indebted to the Bank of Potomack in thc.
-um of 6.300 dollars, upon a note. diw,'omnted a, fh Ianl.

and upon which Janney was the endorser; for whose secu-

~ rity Shreeve transferred to him, and John Roberts, who was

also his endorser upon other notes, certain property at a va-

luation, but which, upon settlement of accounts between
them, fell short Qf Janney's responsibility to the bank upon
his endorsement, 1.980 dollars 88 cents, for which, by
agreement between the parties, Shreeve gave to Janney five
bonds, payable i five annual instalments, and Janney was
to pay the note to the bank, upon which he was the endorset. The note, however, was continued running in the
bank in its original form, Janney appearing responsible as
endorser only. This not6 was renewed from 'time to time
until the 19th of May, 1809, when, by the payments which
had been made by Janney out Qf the ptoperty assigned by
Shreeve, it was reduced to the sum of 3,306 dollars ; .and
Jainey .himself havlng failed about this time,mo further
payments were made upon this oote until the month of
June, 1818. when Shreeve, after a long absence, returned
to Alexandria, and was called upon by the bank for payment of his note, upon which he paid the sum of 3,345
dollars 29 cents, being the amount of principal and interesf
due upon the five bonds which he had given to Janney.
Upon thi brief statement of the facts as between Shreeve
and Janney, it will be 'seen, that Shreeve was exposed to a
double responsibility for the same debt. He was liable on
his note held by the bank, (unless the bank may'be considered as having assented to the, arrangement, and accepted
Janney as solely responsible on the note, which will be
hereafter considered,).and he was also liable to Janney on
the bonds which he had given him. For the purpose -of indemnifying Shreeve against his responsibility to the bank,
Janney gave him the instrument bearing date the Ist of
March, .18b9, acknowledging that Shreeve had satisfied him
by his bonds of the 28th of February, 1809, for all demands
against him as security at bank, and for all other accounts ;
and that the note above referred to, although originally discounted' for the use of Shreeve, was continued in his damc,
but for the colivenience of him, Janney, and vngaging to
save Shreeve harmless from the said note. and in due time

of Janney, on 9ssuming the payment of the note to the bank,
was a contract of nndemnmty only, and rested in damages,
and could never form the subecl of a set-off at law, and
although an action at law mightbe maintained against Janney
upon this indemnity, it would be going too far, even if Janney was solvent, to say, that a Court of equity could not interpose and stay a recovery upon the bds. but that the
party must be tiried round to his remedy at law upon his

and although, by the agreement between him and Janney,

The letter-of license given by the bank to Shreeve bears
date on the 12th January, - 1809, and was for the term of
seven years, which, of course, expired in January, 1816. It
certainly cannot be pretended that the statute ran during the
continuance of this letter of liceuse. Payment of the note
was demanded by the bank, and made by Shreeve, in June,
1818, about-twa years and five mhnths after the expiration
of the letter of license, a period much within the time necessary to bar the action.

rule iu chancery, and that which is recognised by the laws of
Virginia which are in force in Alexandria. Nor has any thing
occurred, since the assignrhent, to give to Scott or the creditors of Janney any additional rights. These bonds were assigned by Janney as his own property, and for the benefit of
his own creditors, which was a violation of the trust and confidence reposed in him by. Shreeve. They were given expressly, accordingto the agreement of the parties,.to provide
for the payment of the note to the bank of Potomack; and it
is admitted that no part of this note has been paid.out of the
funds of Janney. The note had been reduced from %6,300
to $3,306, at the time Janney failed in the spring of 1809,
but these payments were made out of Shreeve's funds, assigned by Janney to Roberts by the deed of the 11th of August. 1802. And it is also admitted that Scott. the assi]gnec

The o y remaining inquiry is, whether the bank, by any had accepted

The answer of the appellant, Scott, alleges, that Janney charged the

,considered himself as ha ing assumed the payment of the
note in question, and that he was considered debtor to the
bank for the same, and was solely relied upon by the bank
for the payment of the note. That he believed the bank
had full knowledge-of the deed of the 11th of August, 1808,
by which provision was made for the payment of the -note,
and were satisfied With it. And he further alleges, that the
bank was so well satisfied with thjs provision, that it corisi.
dered neither-Janney nor Shreeve liable for it.
If these allegations were supported by,proof, they woqld
go far, if not conclusively, to show that the bank had adopted Janney as solely responsible for the note, and had dis.
charged Shreeve. If so, the payment by Shreeve woul4 be
considered voluntary, and without any legal obligation, and
would form no objection to the recovery on the bonds.
The baik, however, denies it was a party o the arrange.
ment made by the deed of the IIth of August, 1808, pr
that it made any stipulation or agreement with Shreeve PI'
Janney, in any manner connected with that deed, unless

The answer of Scott is not evidence against the bank-,

ed Janey as the sole debtor

are positively denied by the answerof tie b1i.k. and which
answer is strongly supported by the orter fbr the tettot ot
license, which was granted subsequent to the arrangeeuen
between Shreeve and Janney. For, if the bank had considered Shreeve exonerated from the payment ot the note.
there could have been no necessity for. or propriety in, giv.
ing him a letter of license. Indeed, it would have bee,
absurd to give a letter of license to a man who was jnt
debtor to the bank.

The order tot th ;i,.urpuse l CLttioUS-

ly drawn, so as to retain the responsiblitt) ot both maker and
endorser. The indulge-ce is granted expressy upron the
condition that it is saictioned by Janney, and without lessening the right of the bank against him.
Nor is the bank chargeable with negligence tlat can in any
manner prejudice its rights, or of which the appellant has
any right to complain. The indulgence was granted with
the concurrence of Janney, and under an impression, no
doubt, by all parties, that the trust fund created by the deed
of the 11th of August, 180" would be sufficient to satisfy
this note. And it was upon this supposition. no doubt, that
the letter of license -for seven years was granted to Shreeve.
No steps would be taken g:.ai.-t Lim until the expiration of
that time, and demand of paymfilt was made as soon thereafter as he returned to Ale .andrina.
The utmost, then, that can be alleged against the bank
is, that it had full knowledge of the provision made by
the deed of the IIth of August, 1808. for the payment
of this note. And, admitting that provision to have been
'amply sufficient, it would not bind the batik without its assent to resort to that fund alone, and discharge the parties
to the note. The bank could have no objection to the provision made by that deed for the payment of the note, as it
would add to its security if the maker and endorser were
also held responsible. And the proceedings in relation to
the letter of license are conclusive to show, that it was the
xuiderstanding of all parties, that the bank had not. at that

time, relinquished its claims upon Janney and Shreeve
for the payment of the note.
We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the decree of the
Court below, granting a perpetual injunction against the appellant, and a dismission of the bill as to the Nnk. be affirmed. with costs.
