cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs and

JAMES

B.

GILIER, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. GEORGE POINDEXTER.

On the 30th of January, 1835, Poindexter purchased from Thomas a right of entry
in certain lands in Louisiana, with authority to locate the lands in the name of
Thomas, and they were so located. Subsequently to such location, viz. on the
27th of November, 1840, Thomas, by notarial act, transferred to Poindexter all
the right which Thomas then had, or thereafter might have, to the land so located,

and authorized Poindexter to obtain a patent in his own name. The patent,.however, was issued to Thomas, and not to Poindexter. This did not vest in Poindexter
a kgal title, which would enable him to recover in a petitory action, which corresponds with an action Af ejectment. Poindexter did not take a legal title, either by
direct conveyance or by estoppel.
On the 20th ot November, 1835, Poindexter, by a conveyance of record, conveyed
his right in the lands in question to Huston, and on the same day, by articles of copartnershipwith Huston, not of record, uthorized Huston to apply these lands for
the mutual benefit of Poindexter and Huston.

A purchaser from Huston without notice is not affected by these articles.

THis case was brought up, by ,Nvrit of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the District of Louisiana.
On the 30th of June, 1834, Congress passed an "Act granting to General Philemon Thomas, of Louisiana, a tract of land,
in consideration of the military services rendered by him in
taking possession of that portion of West Florida included in
the District of Baton Rouge." By this act, Thomas was authorized to enter, without payment, two sections of land on any
of the lands of the United States in the State of Louisiana.
On the 30th of January, 1835, Thomas executed a deed to
George Poindexter, in which, for the consideration of $ 7,500,
he "granted, bargained, and sold unto him, the said George
Poindexter, his heirs and assigns, for ever, all the right, title,
interest, and claim whatsoever, which lie, the said Philemon
Thomas, may have, or might hereafter have, in and by virtue
of the recited act of Congress; and the said Philemon Thomas
doth hereby authorize and empower the said George Poindexter to make the location or locations of the said twelve hundred
and eighty acres of land for his own proper use and benefit, or
proper use and benefit of his heirs or assigns, in the same manner, and with the same effect, as he, the said Philemon Thomas,
might have done in his own name if this conveyance had not
been made."
-22:K

SUPREME COURT.
Gilmer v. Poindexter.

On the 20th of November, 1835, Poindexter entered into articles of copartnership with one Felix Huston, in which it was
stipulated, that Poindexter conveyed to Huston the right of entry yet remaining unlocated, so that the said entry may be
made in the name of Huston, and the-said Huston agreed on
his part to purchase eight thousand dollars' worth of floats, and
hold the whole for the joint and equal benefit of Poindexter
and Huston. The articles contained other stipulations, but
they were not recorded and executed in the presence of *William Burns, an attesting witness.
On the same day, viz. the 20th of November, 1835, Poindexter executed a deed to Huston, from which the following is
an extract "And by these presents doth grant, bargain, sell, convey, and
confirm unto the said Felix Huston, his heirs and assigns for
ever, all the right, title, interest, and claim whatsoever, which
he; the said George Poindexter, has, or heretofore may have
had, or might hereafter have, in and by virtue of an act of Congress of the United States, approved June 30th, 1834, granting
Philemon Thomas, without payment, the quantity of twelve
hundred and eighty acres of land, to be lcated on any of the
lands of the United States within the State of Louisiana, at
the proper land office, with a proviso, that the.same shall be
located in tracts of not less than six hundred and forty acres,
according to iegal subdivisions; which said land was conveyed
by the said Philemon Thomas to the said George Poindexter,
by indenture entered into on the 30th day of January, A, D.
1835; which is of record in the District Court for the County
of-Washington, in the District of Columbia. And the said
George Poindexter doth hereby authorize and -empower the
said Felix Huston to make the location or locations of the said
twelve hundred and eighty acres for his own 'proper use and
benefit, or the proper use and benefit of his heirs and assigns, in
the same manner and with the same effect as he, the said George
Poindexter, might have done in his own name, by virtue of the
said act of indenture from the said Philemon Thomas to the
said George P6indexter. And the said Felix Huston, being
,present, declares that he accepts this act with all its clauses."
This deed was recorded in the parish of Concordia.
On the 27th of November, 1840, Thomas and Poindexter
executed the following instrument, viz. :cc State of Louisiana,
Parish of Bast Baton Rouge.
"Wher'eas, on the 30th day of January, 183.5, General Philemon Thomas, of this parish, for valuable consideration to him

two sections of land on any of the lands of the United Stateq,
in the State of Louisiana, granted to the said Philemon
Thomas by an act of Congress passed in the year 1834. And
whereas, in order to complete the said location, the said Philemon Thomas executed to the said George Poindexter a power
of attorney, with the right of substitution, authorizing the said
location to be made inthe name of him, the said Philemon
Thomas; which location, according to the tenor and effect of
the said power of attorney, was made on two sections of the
lands of the United States in township eighteen north, range
ten west, and in township nineteen north, range thirteen and
fourteen west.
"Now, therefore, in order to enable the said George Pdindexter to perfect his title by withdrawing from the land office at
Natchitoches the final certificate of said locatiQn, he, the said
Philemon Thomas, hereby, for himself, his heirs, executors, and
administrators, transfers to the said George Poindexter, his heirs,
executors, and administrators, all the right, title, interest, and
claim which he, the said Philemon Thomas, has, or hereafter
may have, in and to the two sections of land located as aforesaid in the name of said Philembn Thomas, and further does
authorize the said George Poindexter to obtain a patent for
the lands so located in his own' name at the General Land
Office of the United States at the city of Washington.
" And the said George Poindexter, being here present, accepts
this transfer made in his favor.

recorded.
On the 15th of January, 1844, Patten executed to James Erwin a full power of attorney, authorizing him to sell the lands
upon such terms as he might deem proper, execute deeds, &c.
On the 28th of March, 1844, Erwin executed a deed to Gilmer, conveying the lands to him for $ 6,473.60, with a warranty
of title.
On the 20th of February, 1847, Poindexter brought a petitory
action in the Circuit Court of the Ujnited States for Louisiana,
reciting the grant by Congress to Thomas, the deed from
Th6mas to himself, the location, and the patent. By virtue of
these documents, he claimed to be the legal owner and proprietor of the parcels of land therein described, and justly entitled
to the possession thereof.
On the 31st of March, 1847, Gilmer answered. He referred
to his deed from Patton, through Erwin, and cited him in warranty.
On the 10th of May, 1848, the judgment of the court was
pronounced on the law and evidence in favor of the petitioner.
The documentary evidence was ordered to be placed upon the
record. The following bill of exceptions was taken, viz. "Be it remembered, that, on the trial of this cause, plaintiff
offered in evidence a paper purporting to be articles of agreement between plaintiff and one Felix Huston, and to have
been signed and sealed by them, and purporting to bear date
November 20th, 1835; said paper also purported to have been
signed by one William Burns, as subscribing witness. No testimony was offered as to the sealing or delivery of said paper,
gr the time when it was made; the subscribing witness was
'not called to testify, but a witness was examined who testified
that the names of said Poindexter and Huston, subscribed to
said paper, were in the handwriting of said parties. Witness
knew nothing of the execution of said instrument. Defendant,
by his counsel, objected to the reception of said paper in evidence, on the giound that there was no proof whatever of the
time when it was signed, nor of the sealing and delivery of the
same. Defendant objected also to the admissibility of said
paper in evidence, even if the due execution thereof were duly
proved, on the ground that it was a private act, not recorded,
to which defendant was not R party, or of which he had notice;
and on the further ground, that the effect of said paper in evidence would be to contradict, qualify, and explain the positive
and direct admissions of plaintiff, made in his conveyance, by
authentic act, to said Huston, on the 20th day of November,

1835; which said authentic act of conveyance had been offered
in evidence by the defendant. The objections of defendant
were overruled by the court, and the paper received in evidence ; to which defendant, by his counsel, excepts.
"Be it further remembered, that, on the trial of this cause,
defendant offered to introduce testimony to prove the value of
the improvements made by him upon the land in controversy,
in support of his answer and plea in reconvention; the court
refused to receive or hear said testimony; to which refusal defendant, by his counsel, excepts, and tenders this, his bill of
exceptions, and prays that the same may be signed.
"THo. H. MCOALB, [sEAL.]

U. S. Tude."
A writ of error, sued out by Gilmer, brought the case up to
this court. It was argued by 1l'. Badger, for the plaintiff in
error, and by JiLk. Coxe and 11-. Griltendea(Attornev-General),
for the defendant in er-or.
The following points were raised by the counsel for the
plaintiff in error.
First Point. The plaintiff has shown no title for the lands
sued for. Those described in the petition, and those claimed
by his'deed of transfer from General Thomas, and those described in the patent to Thomas, are all different; and in this,
a petitory action, the plaintiff must show title as in ejectment.
3 La. R. 134, 150; 14 La. R. 16; 7 La. R. 45; 8 iMart. N. S.
105.
Second Point. On the full disclosure of titles on both sidet,
as-shown in the record, the defendant Gilmer has shown a complete legal title in himself. Freeman's Ch. R. 203; 2 Wheat.
197, 198, 199, 205. Or if not a legal title, a perfect equity
protected a a legal title by estoppel, and by enuring of the
patent in Thomas's name, to the use and support of the
equity sold by him. 2 Howard, 316, 317; 6 Howard, 291;
12 La. R. 172, 173; C. C. art. 2451; 4 Yerger, 96; 2 How.
(Miss.) .915; Walker's RI. 97; Freeman's Ch. R. 181; 8 La.
R. 109 13 La. R. 132.
Third Point. The partnership kgreement between Poindexter and Huston, referred to in defendant's bill of exceptions,
was inadmissible eviolence for the plaintiff Poindexter; because
a mere secreted counter-letter, contradictory of Poindexter's
recorded conveyance to Huston, under which Gilmer claims
(13 La. R. 132) ; and because equally contradictory and inconsistent with'the title which Poindexter sets forth in his petition,
and wholly impertinent to the issue made in the pleadings.

262

SUP:REME COURT.
Gilmer v. Poindexter.

And also because there was no evidence of the execution
of the said agreement admissible in law,-the subscribing
witness not being.called, or his absence accounted for, or any
acknowledgment of the instrument by the parties present, or
evidence of the fact of sealing and delivery. 2 Phil. Ev. 202,
203; McKinder b. Littlejohn, 1 Tred. 66.
Fourth Point. It is a manifest and palpable error, that the
court below refused to permit Gilmer, under his plea in reconvention, to prove the value of his improvements as a purchaser
in good faith, and which good faith is a presumption of laiv in
Louisiana. C. C. art. 3447; C. P. art. 375; 17 La. R. 183; 4 La.
R. 273; 8 La. R. 119, 120.
Fifth Point. It is error patent upon the face of the record,
and independent of the evidence in the cause, or of the bill of
exception filed, that the court has given no judgment affecting
the party cited in warranty. C. C. art. 2493, 2494; C. P. art.
378 to 384. And the court had no right or discretion to postpone or to pretermit this judgment. C. P. art. 335; 10 La. R.
120; 2 Rob. 199, 200.
Sixth Point. It is error patent on the pleadings and judgment, that the court has awarded a recovery of lands not sued
for or demanded in the petition. 1 Poth. Oblig. part 4, ch. 3,
art. 2, § 1, p. 4 2 5 ; 1 Partidas, part 3, tit. 22, laws 15, 16, pp.
278, 279.
Seventh Point. It is error patent on the judgment, 1hat no
sort of reason is assigned for its rendition. Constitution of La.
of 1845, art. 70; 5 Mart. 687 to 689; 4 Mart. 463, 464,465;
11 La. R. 162.
Mr. Coxe 4nd Mi'r. Crittenden,for the defendant in error, contended, -

1st. That the bill of eVceptions was not taken in time. From
the record it appears that it was not taken until after the trial
had been concluded for some time, after motions for a new
trial had been made, argued, and overruled.
The uniform practice upon this subject requires that the bill
of exceptions must be tendered at the trial. 2 Tidd, 788; 4
Dall. 240; 1 Binney, 38; 10.Johns. 312.
This proceeding, introduced into the English law by the
Statute of Westminster, 13 Edward I, is unknown to civil
law, and to the courts which administer that system. It was
introduced into the courts of Louisiana by'special legislation,
and, being thus borrowed from the English law, is taken with
all its accompaniments and limitation.
There are several provisions in the Code of Practice relating
to bills of exceptions.

DECEMBE'_

TERM, 1850.

263

Gilmer v. Poindexter.

Art. 487. If one of the parties calls upon the court to express
an opinion on a point of law arising in the cause, such opinion
may be excepted to.
Art. 488. The party -excepting to the opinion of the court
must draw a: bill of exceptions, in which the question of fact or
of law, on which such opinion has been demanded, maybe
concisely set forth, as well as the grounds of the exception so
taken.
Art. 489. The bill of exceptions must be exhibited to the adverse party, &c.
In this case it does not appear that the adverse party knew
any thing of the matter.
The objection, as stated, is inferred from the language of the
bill of exceptions, but is given, not in the form of an objection,
but as a statement of facts. Now, as it does not appear what
other evidence had beerf given, the bald question is raised
whether, under any circumstances, a sealed instrument is admissible in evidence on proof of the handwriting of the parties.
Carroll v. Peake, 1 Peters, 22, 23.
Upon the principle that the opinion of the court below must
be regarded as sound until its incorrectness is made to appear,
the plaintiff in error cannot prevail, unless he can show that no
case could have existed in which the paper objected to could be
considered in the light of an original document.
In that case, the court, to sustain the judgment, would suppose that a paper, confessedly a copy, had been proved to be
equal in credit td an original. Here they will presume it necessary that evidence was given which showed that the subscribing witness was dead or beyond the reach of the court, and
that his handwriting could not be proved. In such a case,
proof of the handwriting of tho parties was the only evidence
which could be given, and the best the circumstances of the
case permitted, and was therefore competent. Long v. Ramsay,
I Serg. & Rawle, 72.
It was held that a subscribing witness was not necessary to
the validity of a deed, and that proof of the handwriting of the
obligor was sufficient. 2 T. R. 41.
Where a deed has come out of the hands of the other party,
no proof of execution is necessary. 7 Taunt. 251; 8 Gill .&
-K,
Johns. 511.
In Maryland, the execution of an instrument in writing, to
which there is a subscribing witness, may be proved without
calling said subscribing witnress, though present ii' court (this
by statute). The case here was in Louisiana, where the rigid
rules of the common law are not recognized.
3. This does not, however, seem to have been made a ground

of objection; the specific objection is, that no proof is given
of the time when the paper was signed, nor of the sealing and
delivery.
The answer to this is, the paper being proved, it proves the
time by its date, and the sealing and delivery. The objection
would be equally applicable in a case where, the death of the
subscribing witness being proved, his handwriting was proved.
The next distinct objection is, that it was a private act, not
recorded, to which defendant was not a party, and of which
he had notice.
How far these objections were sustained in point of fact
must depend upon the evidence which had been given. As
we are utterly uninformed upon that point, it is impossible for
this court to say that any error has been committed., It is
clear that such a paper needed no record to give it validity, as
between the parties and those who, before they purchased and
paid the purchase-money, were apprised of its existence. The
language of the bill of exceptions is so ambiguous, that it is by
no means clear that any notice had at any time been given to
defendant, when such notice was given, or merely that he was
not notified at the date of thie execution of the paper.
Mr. Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion of the coutt.
This is a writ of error to a judgment of -the Circuit Court
of the United States for the District of Loujiiana.
The defendant in error instituted a petitory action in the
court just mentioned, to recover certain lands in Louisiana in
the possession of James B. Gilrmer, the plaintiff in error.
The petition of Poindexter sets forth, that by an act of Congress approved on the 30th day of May, 1834, entitled "An
Act granting to General Philemon Thomas a tract of land in
consideration of military services, &c.," the said Thomas was
authorized to enter, without payment, two sections of land on
any of the lands of the United States in Louisiana. That
Thomas, on the 30th of January, 1835, sold to the petitioner
this right of entry, and authorized him, or his substitute, to
make the location in the name of Thomas. That the petitioner
afterwards caused said location to be made on two sections
of land in Louisiana,.north of Red River, one of which (de-'
scribed in parcels) contained 619 / acres, and is the land in
controversy.
That after this location, viz. on the 27th of November, 1840,
Thomas by notarial act transferred to the petitioner all the
right title, &c., which he, Thomas,then had,.or thereafter might
have, to the two sections so located, and authorized the petitioner to obtain a patent therefor in his own name." That on

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

265

Gilmer v. Poindexter.

the 26th of March, 1841, a patent was issued for the lands -o
Thomas, by virtue of which, and of the sale and transfer of
the 27th of November, 1840, the petitioner avers that he became the legal owner of the lands claimed, and is entitled to
the possession thereof. That Gilmer has taken unlawful possession of one section of the land in township 19, range 14
and refused to surrender it to the petitioner, who therefore
prays judgment for possession of the land, and for rents and
profits. The agreements between Thomas and Poindexter of
the 80th of January, 1835, and of the 27th day of November,
1840, and the patent to Thomas of the 26th day of March,
1841, referred to in the petition, were" filed as exhibits therewith.
The tenant in possession, Gilmer, after a general denial in
his answer of any right or title to the land in the petitioner,
alleges that he is the possessor and true owner of the latnd
claimed, by purchase in good faith for valuable consideration
from James W. Patten, by a notarial act executed in New
Orleans on the 28th of May, 1844; that Patten's conveyance
to him was with general warranty, and he therefore avouches
Patten in warranty; and prays that, in the event of his eviction,
he may have a recovery over against his warrantor, Patten, for
the value of the land and improvements made by the defendant. This cause, according to the practice in tife State of
Louisiana, was tried by the court, -without the intervention of a
jury, and the court, after hearing the parties, by its opinion expressed on the 10th day of May, but signed on the 28th of Jne,
1848, and considered as of the day last named, gave the following judgment, viz. :-" It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed,
that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff, George
Poindexter, and against the defendant, James B. Gilmer, for
the premises described in the plaintiff' petition, and that the
said Gilmer surrender to the plaintift the possession of the
following described parcels of land, &c., and that the plaintiff
have a writ of haberefacias possessionem to place him in legal
possession thereof. The right of the plaintiff for mesne profits
and of the defendants to sue for improvements, is reserved respectively."
In addition to the documents above mentioned, filed as exhibits with the plaintiff's petition, there was offered in evidence
on the part of the petitioner, and admitted by the court, an instrument of writing executed on the 20th day of November
1835, between Poindexter and one Felix Huston, in which it
was amongst other things recited, that the parties to that instrument had formed a partnership for the purposes of purchasing lands of the United States, or pregmption rights, or enVOL. x.

tries of individuals, for the joint and mutual benefit of the parties; and that the said Poindexter, having purchased of General
Philemon Thomas his right to locate the quintity of twelve
hundred and eighty acres of land on any of the public lands
in Louisiana, granted by an act of Congress passed on the
30th of June, 1834, and having.obtained of the said Thomas,
on the 30th of January, 1835, a conveyance of his said right
of entry, which yet remains unlocated, the said Poindexter
agreed to convey to the said Huston his right of entry derived
under the said deed, in the saie manner as he acquired the
same from the said Philemon Thomas, so that the said entry
may be made in the name of the said Felix Huston, to be
held by him for the joint and equal benefit of him the said
George Poindexter, &c. This instrument, being a private
declaration of trust between Poindexter and Huston, not evidenced by any record or other public acknowledgment of the
parties, was attested by a single witness, William Burns, who
was not called at the trial to prove its execution, was received
in evidence by the court without such proof, and its reception
was exce ted to.for that cause. It does not appear, moreover,
that a knowledge of this instrument was brought home either
to Patten or to Irwin, his attorney in fact, from whom Patten
purchased.
The plaintiff in error relied in the Circuit Court on the following proofs: - 1st. On the act of Congress granting the right
of entry to Thomas. 2dly. On the public act and consveyance
from Thomas to Poindexter, as recited in the petition. 3dly.
The plaintiff in error next adduced in proof a public and authentic act of sale and conveyance, on the 20th of November,
1835, to Huston, in absolute right, of all his, Poindexter's, title,
interest, and estate in the grant to Thomas, then vested, or
which might vest at any future period. 4tbly. The public authentic act of Huston, conveying the land in controversy with
general warranty, on the 20th of January, 1844, and reciting
in its tqrms the conveyance from Thomas to Poindexter of the
30th of January, 1835, and that of Poindexter to Huston of
the 20th of November, I835, and describing the land so conveyed -as that "which was located by said Huston according
to the provisions of the above-mentioned act of Congress."
5thly. The public authentic act of Patten, constituting Irwin
his attorney in fact to sell and convey the lands purchased of
Ifuston. And 6thly, and -lastly, the conveyance by Patten, by
his said attorney, Irwin, of the lands in controversy to Gilmer,
the tenant in possession in March, 1844, with warranty.
In considering this case, it is proper to carry with us through-out, as a standard by which to test the proceedings in the Cir-

Gilmer v. Poindexter.

cuit Court and the decision founded upon them, this contrelling principle, -that the petitory action is a proceeding at law
for the recovery of property, and can be maintained in the
courts of the United States only where the right of'possession
can be shown, and, according to'the principles and distinctions
settled in this court, corresponds in character with the action
of ejectment at commonlaw.
The petitioner or plaintiff, therefore, in a petitory action, must
recover upon the strength of his title, and that must be a legal,
as contradistinguished from an equitable title. See United
States v. King et al., 7 How. 846, 847, and Livingston v.
Story, 9 Peters, 632. Tried by this rule, w6 are unable to
perceive how the claim of Poindexter, a* set forth in his petition, even if unaffected by his transactions with Huston, can
be maintained in this action. The petitioner alleges that he
purchased of Thomas his right of entry in virtue of the act of
Congress, and received from Thomas a power to make a location in the name of the latter.
By this transaction, no legal title to any certain or specific
land was conveyed, for nothing specific or certain was then
vested in Thomas, and the power of locating alleged in the
petition was a power to locate, not in the name of Poindexter,
but in that of Thomas. The petitioner proceeds to state, that,
after these locations made by him, Thomas, by an authentic
act before a notary public, on the 27th of November, 1840 (a copy
of which is filed with the petition), transferred to the petitioner
all the right, title, &c., which he then had, or thereafter might
have, to the 'sections of land located in his name, and authorized the petitioner to obtain a patent therefor. 'He further
alleges, that afterwards, viz. on the 26th day of March, 1841, a
patent issued to Thomas for the lands located as aforesaid in
his name, and that by virtue of these proceedings, viz. the
transfer by Thomas in 1840, and the patent in 1841, the petitioner became invested with the legal title to the land in dispute. This alleged investiture of the legal title must have
been supposed to rest upon an estoppel operated by tfie transfer and patent before mentioned, for, independently of such an
operation, and by the literal terms of the patent, the title would
certainly be in Thomas, and not in Poindexter. 'But we are
of opinion that in this instance no estoppel has been operated.
This legal effect can occur only where a party has conveyed
a precise or definite legal estate or right, by a solemn assurance, which he will not be permitted to vary or to deny. It
can have no operation to prevent the denial of an equitable
transfer or title, mwhich is not identical with the legal title or
muniment of title which it may be relied on either to estab-

Jish or protect. An estoppel, it is said, should be certain to
every intent, and therefore, if a thing be not directly and precisely alleged, it shall not be estopped. Co. Lit. 303 a, .352
b. So, too, it is laid down, that to the success of an estoppel
it is obviously necessary that the grantor's want of a present
-vested estate should not appear on the deed itself, which would
else contain internal evidence of its invalidity. 2 Sim. & Stu.
519; 3 Adol. & Ell. 12. And with regard to the mode of
using an estoppel, it is said that it must be pleaded if there
be an opportunity; otherwise, the party omitting to plead it
-waives the estoppel. See 2 Smith's Leading Cases, 457, and
the authorities there cited. Again, it is ruled, that an equitable
title cannot be estopped by a verdict at law, for there is no
sach thing as an estoppel in equity. See Com. Dig. Estoppel
(§ 1). Even upon the hypothesis, then, that the title set up by
?oindexter under his agreement with Thomas could be regarded as a legal title, stil! upon.a comparison of the description
of the property contained in those agreements with that, of
The land granted by the patent to Thomas, there is not that
certainty and identity that are required by an estoppel, or such
as will cause the land granted by the patent to Thomas to
enure to Poindexter. But the right set up by Poindexter under
his contracts with Thomas remains strictly an equitable right,
and therefore neither Thomas nor his alienee could be estopped
from averring a right in the land contained in the patent, in
opposition to such equitable claim.
But in another aspect of the question, supposing the interest
transferred to Poindexter by the agreements with Thomas of
January 30th, 1835, and May 14th, 1839, could be so construed
as to have passed to the former a legal title; and admitting, too,
that the description of the property contained in those agreements accorded in precise terms witu that of the lands granted
to Thomas by the patent of March 20th, 1841, it would still
remain to be inquired, whether Poindexter has not parted -7ith
his title, and would not in this aspect of the case be estopped
from setting it up against his alienee, and all claiming under
such alienee.
It appears from the evidence which was before the court, and
already adverted to in the statement of this case, that on the
20th day of November, 1835, Poindexter sold and conveyed,
by his public authentic act, and in absolute right and estate,
-to Felix Huston, all the right, title, interest, and claim which
Ihe then had, or thereafter might have, in and by virtue of an act
of Congress of the 30th of June, 1834, granting to Philemon
Thomas the quantity of twelve hundred andI eighty acres of
land, to be located on any lands of the United States in Lou-

Gilmer v. Poindexter.

isiana, which said land was conveyed by the said Philemon
Thomas to the said George Poindexter on the 30th day of
January, 1835; it further appears, that from Huston a regular title, by public authentic acts and written assurances, is deduced down to the defendant in possession, Gilmer. It is true
that, in order to countervail the force of this title, the petitioner
offered in evidence the agreement between himself and Huston
of the 20th of November, 1835, creating a partnership between
themselves, and purporting to convey to Huston all the title of
Poindexter to the right of entry granted by act of Congress to,
Thomas, to be disposed of and applied by Huston for the benefit, of the partnership ; but it is equally true, that this instrument, which was objected to by the plaintiff in error, was received without legal proof of its execution, and therefore should
not have been admitted and considered by the court; and there
being no proof in this record of any knowledge of the contents,
or even of the existence, of this instrument'on the part of the
purchasers under the absolute and public deed from Poindetter to Huston, their title thus derived, for aught that appears,
cannot be affected by the former instrument.
Upon the whole case, the petitioner in the Circuit Court,
havhg failed to establish a legal title in himself to the premises
demanded, could not maintain his action, and the judgment of
the court should have been for the defendant. It is therefore
the opinion of this court, that the judgment of the Circuit Court
be, and the same is hereby, reversed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the Circuit Court of the United States for" the
District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by
this court, that the judgment of the said Circuit Court in this
cause be, and the same is hereby, reversed, with costs, and
that this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the
said Circuit Court, for further proceedings
to be had therein, in
of this court.
