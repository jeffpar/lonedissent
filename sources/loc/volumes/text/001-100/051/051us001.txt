The report of the commissioners appointed by this court in 7 Howard, 660, to run
and mark the line dividing the States of Missoudif and Iowa, adopted and confirm-

ed, and the boundary line finally established.

THE commissioners appointed by this court to run and
mark the boundary line between said States, according to our
decree of the December term, 1848, having performed that
duty, and reported to the court at this term the manner in
which said work had been performed: and it appearing that
two surveyors had been employed by said commissioners to
aid theni in doing the work in the field; and that other assistants had been employed, and that various expenses had been
incurred in running and marking said line: now, in order that
the parties to said.controversy may be informed of the amount
of means necessary to be provided to pay for said services, and
also for other costs and charges; incident to the suit, it is ordered that the clerk of this court do examine witnesses, and
resort to other evidence, for the purpose of ascertaining what
-is the proper compensation to be allowed to said commissioners and the surveyors they employed; and also what compensation is due to the Hon. Robert W. Wells for such services
as he may have performed as commissioner before he resigned.
And said clerk will also ascertain the amount of expenses, of
every description, incurred by said commissioners, beside the'
compensation to themselves and said surveyors, together with
the costs and charges incurred in this court in carrying on the

controversy here. All of which he will include in a detailed
account, and report the same to this court at an early day, for
its final action thereon.
And in taking said account, the report of said conumissibii.
ers will be taken as prim facie true.
Said clerk will also ascertain and report the amount of
moneys already advanced to said commissioners by the States
of Missouri and Iowa respectively; and the manner in which
said moneys have been expended.
12 December, 1850.
And now, on this third day of January, A. D. 1851, this
cause came on for further order and decree therein, when it
appeared to the court that at the December term, 1848, thereof,
Henry B. Hendershott and Joseph C. Brown were appointed
commissioners to run and mark the line in controversy between the States of Missouri and Iowa; and the said Brown
having died, the Hon. Robert W. Wells was appointed in room
and stead of said Brown by the Chief Justice of this court, in
vacation. And said Wells having resigned his appointment,
William G. Minor was appointed commissioner in room and
stead of said Wells, by this court, at its last December term of
1849; and at which term the time for running and marking
said line was extended to this present term of Decewber, 1850,
for the reasons stated in the report of said Wells and Hendershott, made to the last term; and which is hereinafter embodied. And the present commissioners, Henry B. Hendershott
and William G. afior, have made their report in the premises
to this term; and which report is' s follows: To THE HONORABLE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

The undersigned, appointed commissioners by this honorable court, in the above cases, to establish the boundary line
between the aforesaid States, respectively report, that, for the
purpose of arranging the operations in the field so as to combine economy with speed, we met in the city of St. Louis, in
March last, and there, after consulting experienced surveyors
as to the time that might be consumed in running the line,
the probable amount of expense to be incurred, the necessary
force to be employed, and the proper outfit, we determined
a plan of operations, and agreed to meet at the supposed site
of Sullivan's ".northwest corner," between the 1st and 20th
of April last. While in St. Louis, we obtained from Major M.
L. Clark, Surveyor-General of the States of Missouri and Illinois, a copy of the field notes of the survey made by John C.

Missouri v. Iowa.

Sullivan, in ihe year 1816, of a line beginning on the -east
bank of the Missouri River, opposite the middle of the mouth
of the Kansas River, and extending north one hundred miles,
where he made a comer, and also of the line run by him in an
easterly course to the Des Moines River. ,Wewere 'also furnished by Major Clark with several charts, diagrams, and copies
of surveys which had at various times been made of Portions
of Sullivan's line, and which were of much serviee in the prosecution -f the work.
The surveyors severally appointed by us were William
Dewey, Esq., of Iowa, and Robert Walker, Esq., of Missouri.
Both these gentlemen had been connected with the public
works of their respective States, and enjoy a high professional
reputation.
According to our agreement, we left our respective homes on
the 10th of April labt, and soon after reaching the point of
meeting, in view of increased prices of transportation, provisions, &c., caused by the immense emigration through Southern Iowa and Northern Missouri to California, we altered our
plan of work and reduced our force.
No precise trace of the "old northwest corner" remained,
-the
witness-trees to it were on the margin of a vast prairie,
and had apparently been destroyed by fire years ago. Consequently its exact position could not be ascertained. Yet from
the running of many experimental lines, diligently examining
the evidences before us, together with the reports of the surveyors, we became satisfied of its proper position, and accordingly established it.
Its latitude taken resulted as follows: 400 34' 40"' N.
At the comer so determined we planted a large, solid cast-iron
pillar, weighing between fifteen ani ixteen hundred pounds,
four feet six inches long, squaring twelve inches at its base
and eight inches at its top. This pillar was deeply and legibly
marked with the words (strongly cast into the iron) "Missouri"
on its south side, "Iowa" on its north side, and " State Line"
on the east.
From the monument so planted-at the "northwest corner"
aforesaid, in the said latitude, the survey of the line was commenced, running due west on said parallel of latitude to the
Missouri River, as directed by this honorable court, and at its
terminus, as near the bank of said Missouri River as the perishable nature of the soil would admit we planted a monument similar in figure, weight, dimension, and inscription to
the one planted at the "northwest corner," the words "State
Line" facing the east.

SUPREME COURT.
Missouri v. Iowa.

Unexpected delays, arising from a condition of-the weather
which prevented the surveyors from making reliable astronomical observations, together with the fact, that, to a great extent,
in the vicinity of said line there were no roads, and the settle.
ments distant and sparse, compelling us to open a track for the
transportation of the monuments and baggage of the corps,
and also to construct necessary bridges and grade fords, greatly
retarded the work.
Returning to the "northwest comer," the survey of the line
was commenced, extending eastwardly from said "corner" to
the Des Moines River, as run and marked by said Sullivan, in
1816, from said corner to said river. On this line, by close examination, we discovered abundant blazes and many witnesstrees, which enabled us to find and re-mark the said line, as
directed by this honorable court.
The survey of this portion of the line, more than one hundred and fifty miles in length, was commenced on the 13th day
of August, and finished on the 18th of September.
Near the bank of the Des Moines River where the line terminated, we planted a cast-iron pillar, similar in weight, figure,
dimensions, and inscriptions to those planted at the "northwest corner," and near the bank of the Missouri River, the
words "State Line" facing the west.
Solid pillars of cast-iron, weighing each between three and
four hundred pounds, and minutely described as to ilgure and
inscriptions in the report heretofore made to this honorable
court by Messrs. Wells and Hendershott, commissioners, we
caused to be planted at every ten miles in the due west line
extending from said "northwest comer" to the Missouri River,
and also at every ten miles in the line extending east from the
"northwest corner" aforesaid to the Des Moines River.
No iron monument was planted at mile 150 in the line running east, because between it and the point where the large
one 19 planted on the bank of the Des Moines River there existed but a small fraction of ten miles, being only fifty-one
chains.
For a fuller account of the said survey we respectively refer
to the report of the surveyors made to us, marked A, and to

HENDERSHOTT

AND

I MoR,

Commissioners of the

Boundary Survey.
Gentlemen, - Having been appointed by you, on the part
of the States of Iowa and Missouri severally, to locate and
survey the boundary between those States, under the decree
of the Supreme Court of'the United States, we met according
to your appointment, on the 28th of April last, near the supposed site of the old. northwest corner, for the purpose of
commencing operations in the field.
Ve proceeded to search for the old corner, which was to be
the basis of our future operations. Having a certified copy of
Sullivan's field notes, from the Surveyor-General's office at St.
Louis, we knew that the corner had been originally located in
timber, and designated by two witness-trees.. Aided by a view
of the topography of the locality, - as indicated in the notes,
and especially by the minner in which Sullivan's iorth line
crossed the Platte River near its terminus, - we were able to
determine the locality of the corner approximately; and an inspection of the ground satisfied us that every evidence of its
exact position had long since disappeared. Time, and the fires
that annually spread over the prairies, had destroyed the witness-trees and every trace of both lines near the corner.
This point, known familiarly as the "old northwest corner," was the termination of the line surveyed by Sullivan, in
1816, iom the mouth of the Kansas River north one hundred
miles, and was the point at which he turned east, in running
to the Des Moines River, his miles being numbered north from
the Kansas, and east beginning again at the corner.
Having no direct evidence of the exact site of the required
point, it became necessary to find determinate points in the
two lines as near the corner as.possible. Prolonging the lines
severally from such points, their intersection would be the
point to be assumed as the corner, and, if Sullivan's measure.
ment were correct, would be the precise spot where he established it.
Near the supposed locality of the 99th mile corner- on the
north line, we found a decayed tree and a stump, which correspond in course, distance, and description with the witness-trees
to that corner, and cutting into the tree we saw what we supposed to be the remains of an old blaze, upon which was preserved a.part, apparently, of the letter M. This supposition
1*

6

SUPREME COURT.
Missouri v. Iowa.

was verified by measuring south.two miles to a point, which
we found to be Sullivan's 97th mile corner from one witnesstree, which was perfectly sound. The marks upon it, two or
three inches beneath the bark, were plain and legible.
On the east line we found the witness-tree to the 3d mile
corner. The wood upon which the marks had been inscribed
was decayed, but their reversed impression appeared upon the
new growth which covered the old blaze, and which was cut
out in a solid block.
Prolonging the lines three miles each from the points thus
determined, their intersection was assumed as the required
comer, and at that point was planted the monument specified in the decree. By measurement made from the surveyed
lines, we found the comer to be in the northeast quarter of
section 35, township 67 north, range 33 west. Its exact position- with reference to those lines can'be seen in the diagram
in the field notes. See post, p. 15.
The latitude of the comer, dtermined by a series of observations taken on the ground, we found to be 400 34' 40"
north. While employed upon these observatibns, we were delayed by unfavorable weather, and it was not till the 24th of
May that we were in readiness to commence the survey of the
-west line from the corner to the MVissouri River.
This portion of the boundary, being required to be a parallel
of latitude, was run with Burt's solar compass, the use of
whi~h requires the longitude of the place of obs rvation to be
at least approximately known. Not having the requisite
means of ascertaining the longitude of the come ,, we calculated it fim maps to be about 940 430" west from Greenwich,
which was sufficiently accurate for the purpose. The instrument used being an untried one, some delay wa. experienced
in its adjustment. To insure accuracy in the work, a telescope was attached to it.
The principles upon which this line was ran involve a mathematical investigation, which will be found in Note A, accompanying this report, but the mode of running it will be briefly
described here. Each successive mile was prolonged in the
plane of the prime vertical passing through its beginning.
'The direction indicated by the instrument stationed at the beginning of a mile is in the plane of the prime vertical passing
through that point, and that direction was continued through
the mile by means of fore and back sights. At the end of the
mile, an offset north was made to compensate for the sphericity
of the each. This offset, it will be seen by the note, is 6.856
inches for one mile. 'The instrument being moved at the end
.of the mile the proper, distance north. and a new direction

given and continued as. before, the parall&I passing through the
initial point was continued throughout the line. In some instances, however, it became convenient, whenever the nature
of the ground admitted of it, instead of offsetting, to continue
the same direction through several miles. It will be seen by
the note, that the offsets increase as the squares of the distances, being for one mile 6.855 inches, for two miles, four
times that distance, &c.
Thus it appears that the offsets rapidly increase with the
distance run, and that by continuing the direction of the prime
vertical from the corner to the terminus, the southing would
have been over 2,000 feet.
At the western terminus of the line, the observations for latitude were repeated. Having established that point, we returned to the northwest corner and commenced retracing Sullivan's east line on th6 13th of August.
It is thirty-four years since this line was run, and every vestige of the mounds and pits established in the prairie has disappeared. Much of the country through which it passes consists of brushy barrens, or high rolling prairies, dotted with detached groves, or covered with a thin growth of dwarf timber.
Much of this description of timber has been destroyed by fire,
forming in some instances prairie, and in others brushy barrens, destitute of trees; while in some places an entirely new
growth of young timber, principally hickory, has, sprung up.
In all such cases the witness-trees and other marks mentioned
in Sullivan's field notes were gone, and thus it occurred that
we frequently were several miles without finding any traces of
the line. But in-heavy bodies of timber no difficulty was experienced in discovering evidences of the precise location of
the line, not only by blazes, but by line and witness-trees,
many of which are sound, and the marks in good preservation.

We soon satisfied ourselves that the line n by Sullivan

8

SUPREME COURT.
Missouri v. Iowa.

was'not only not a dtLe east line, but that it was not straight.
That more or less northing should have been made in the old
line was to have been expected from the fact that Sullivan
ran the whole line with one variation of the needle, and that
variation too great. This would account for the fact that the
northing increases as he progressed east. But there are great
irregularities in the course of the line, for which it is difficult
toL find a cause. Sudden deviations amounting to from one to
tlree degrees frequently occur, and it rarely happens that any
two consecutive miles pursue the same direction.
A resurvey of the line between the 91st and 134th miles was
made in the year 1846, .and we found the witness-trees on that
part of the line defaced, and others substitaited. We succeeded,
however, in identifying Sullivan's trees, and we destroyed the
marks 6f that survey as far as they related to the old line. In
all instances where a corner on Sullivan's line is mentioned in
our field notes, one or both witness-trees were found to identify
it and we did not always think .itnecessary to repeat the fact
in the notes.
Accompanying this report .are the field notes and map of
the boundary, the former of which are sufficiently explained in
the note prefixed to them.
On the west line the monuments every ten miles were
deemed stzfficient. On the east line mile posts are established,
marked, and witnessed as described in the field notes.
It*will be perceived that the measurement of this line as
rdn by us exceeds that of Sullivan by 1 1 .,V chains, and that
this increase, although gradual, is not regular. Some portions
of the old line agree very nearly with our measurement, while
others differ materially, and the greatest gain is generally made
in brushy and broken land.
For the eonvenienoe of estimating distances, and that the
true length of the line might be indicated by the mile posts,
they were established by our measurement, taking care in every
instance to note the distance of the posts set by us from the
corresponding comers in the old line whenever found. The
different coturses being extended from one known point to
another, the line was not altered at those points, being made
to pass through them, but only its length corrected.
The length of.the entire line is 211 miles and 32 , chains,
embracing 40 1' 7".29 of longitude. The length o a,second
of Iongitude is calculated in Note C, and the longitude of any
point of the line being kgown, that of any other point can be
deduced.
The map is platted from the field notes on a scale of half an

features in the topography of the line. The scale upon which
it is made is much too snall to show the angles in the east
line, to do which would require it to be extended to a length
that would render it inconvenient.. All the purposes for which
it can be used will be attained by its present form.

A line traced upon the earth's surface in an east or west
direction, and accurately prolonged by means of fore and back
sights, will always remain iii the plane of the prime vertical
passing fhrough its beginning; and consequently will gradually tend southward, according to a certain law. Hence, in
running the line from Sullivan's corner to the Msso-dri River, it
was necessary to apply certain corrections in order to regain the
parallel of latitude passing through the initial point. These
corrections may be ascertained in the following manner:We may, without sensible error, consider that part of the
earth's surface on which we have been operating as a portion
of the surface of a sphere whose radius is equal to the radius
of curvature, as above ascertained.

lel intersects the same meridian at.B. Hence, D B is the required correction.
It thus appears that the planes represented by S C, S F, intersecting the plane of the second meridian, will form, externally to the earth, a figure which may be represented by S D
B; and, the are D B being very small, this figure may be
treated as a plane triangle, right-angled at D. The angle %
-%,when projected upon the plane of the second meridian, will,
of course, undergo a diminution; but when (as is the case
here) the inclination of the two meridians is small, this diminution becomes almost infinitesimal in amount, and may be
disregarded. If, therefore, we put u -- ,SD, and v = B D, we
shall have
v = u tan. I. ..........
(8.)
But, making d = the distance along the line between the
meridians, we have from the properties of the circle
2r+u:
d:: d: u;
whence, u (2 r + u = d 2, and u d;
and the quantity
v, in the divisor of the second number, being so minute, when
compared with 2 r, as"to have no effect upon the result within

NOTE. B.

In note A, equation (7), we find 20,872,306 feet to be the
length of the radius of ouriature of the terrestrial meridian at
the parallel, of 400 34' 40"; andi as.this value may be considered constant for a short distance north or south of that paral.
lel, and as radius, expresseol in seconds, is equal to 206,264,806",
we have, for the length of a second of longitude on either side
of the line, for a few miles,
1-- 20o,872,306 = 101.2 feet.
206,264,806
NOTE C.

It is plain that the abseiss x is equal to the radius of the
circle of latitude passing through S.

Surveyor on the part of Iowa.
And the report of the Hon. Robert W. Wells and Henry B.
Hendershott, which is above referred to, and which was made
to the last term of this court, is as follows: -

To

THE HONORABrE THE SUPREME
STATES.

COURT OF THE UNITED

The undersigned, appointed by this honorable court commissioners in the above cases, to establish the boundary line
between the States of Missouri and Iowa, respectively report
that, upon being furnished with copies of' the decree, they, in
compliance therewith, addressed letters to the chief magistrates
of those States, through their Secretaries of State, respectfully
requesting the coiperation and assistance of the State authorities in the performance of the duties imposed on the commissioners by said'decree; and they received assurances, in answer to their, letters, of all the aid and assistance within their"
power.
The Governor of the State of Missouri consented to consider
an appropriation of two thousand dollars, made by the General

46

SUPREME COURT.
Missouri v. Iowa.

Assembly for the purpose of conducting, the suits, as applicable to the establishment of the boundary by the conmmissioners; and agreed to place that sum at their disposal for that
object.
The Governor of the State of Iowa entertained the opinion,
it is understood, that no appropriation had been made by the
Legislature of that State, applicable Vo the survey of the boundary, but endeavored to'obtain the necessary fund- from other
sources; and, as the undersigned are advised, obtained them.
But the commissioners were not informed of this until about
the 23d of October last,- then too late to procure the necessary assistants, fit out an expedition, travel to the place of
commencing operations and complete the work in the field,
before the weather would, in all probability, become too inclement in the vast and high prairies through which the line will
pass. As the grass in the prairies is burned in October, there
would also be some difficulty, after .that, in procuring provender for the teams necessary for the transportation of the baggage, provisions, and moliuments.
For these reasons, and others with which it is unnecessary
to trouble the court, the commissioners resolved not to attempt
the work in the field until the opening of the spring.
The commissio*ners have procured all the monuments necessary for the line. Three are of the size and description directed
in the deckee. Nineteen other cast-iron monuments, six of
which are four feet long, eight inches square at the base, and
five inches square at the top, to be placed at intervals of thirty
miles; and thirteen of which are seven inches square at the
base, and four inches square at the top, and four feet long.
These nineteen monuments each have the word "DMissouri "11
on*one side, and "Iowa" on the opposite side, and the word
"Boundary" on the other opposite sides, strongly cast into
the metal. All the monuments are cast solid; and will weigh
about 13,000 pounds, and cost three cents per pound.
A drawing of the largest sized monument is annexed. The
others are similar in form, except as herein before mentioned.
All of which is most respectfully submitted.

SUPREME COURT,
Missouri v. Iowa.

And said reports not having been excepted to by either of
the parties, they are therefore respectively confirmed and adopted by this court. From said reports, it appears that the old
northwest corner of the Indian boundary line, made by John
C. Sullivan in the year 1816 (and referred to in our former
decree), is found to be at forty degrees thirty-fout minutes and
forty seconds 'of north latitude, and at about ninety-four degrees thirty minutes of west longitude from Greenwich; that
at said "northwest corner" was planted a large cast-iron monument, weighing between fifteen and sixteen hundred pounds,
four feet six inches long, squaring twelve inches at its base,
and eight inches at its top. This ifionument is deeply and
legibly marked with the words (strongly cast into the iron)
"Missouri" on its south side, and "Iowa" on its north side,
and " State-Line" on the east.
And this court doth adjudge and decree, that'said monument
doth mark and ivitness the true northwest crner of the Indian
boundary lines, as run by John C. Sullivan, in 1816. And the
precise corner is hereby established and declared to be in the
centre of the top of said monument.
Said reports further show, that from the monument a line
was ran due west, on a parallel of latitude, to the eastern bank
of the Missouri River; which line appears, by the field notes
accompanying the .reports, t6 be sixty miles -and sixty-one
chgdns in length. And it further appears, by the reports and
field notes, that the commissioners caused to be planted castiron pillars in the line running west from the old northwest
corner, at intervals of ten miles apart, with the word "Boundary" cast in the iron, on the east side and on the west side
of said pillars; and the word "Iowa" facing on the north;
and the word "Missouri" facing on the south. - That in running west, one such pillar 'was planted at the end of ten miles
from the old northwest corner; another at the end of twenty
miles; a third at the end of thirty miles; a fourth at the end
of forty miles; and a fifth at the, end of fifty miles. And at
the end of sixty miles was planted a monument similar to that
erected at the old northwest comer, marked "MI issouri" on its
south side, "1Iowa" on its north side, and " State Line" on the
east. This monument stands sixty-one chains east of the eastern bank of the Missouri River, on firm ground, the bottom
lands beyond being soft and subject to overflow; for which
reason the monument was planted so far east of the Hver.
From this last monument, the line runs due west, on a parallel
of latitude, thrbugh a cottonwood-tree thirty inches in diameter,
notched on the east and west sides, and marked with 'he letter
"I2

on the north, and the letter "M. ' on the south.

And on

the bank of the Missouri River, sixty-one chains west of the
iron monument last planted, a wooden post is set in the
ground, vith two cottonwood pointers, - one of ten inches
diameter standing S. 670 E. 6 links; and the other at N. 210
W. 12 links. from the wooden post. And said line having
been run and marked according to our former decree, it is
therefore now adjudged and decreed, that the true and proper
boundary line between the States of Missouri and Iowa, extending west from 'the centre of the monument standing at
Sullivan's old northwest corner, runs thrdugh the centre of the
five iron pillars and the monument near the Missouri River; and through the cottonwood-tree above described; and
through the centre of the wooden post planted by the commissioners on the eastern bank of the river; and then due
west on a parallel of latitude to the middle of the Missouri
River.
And it further appears from the report of said commissioners, that, pursuant to our sormer decree, they had ascertained
and re-marked Sullivan's line, as run and marked by him in
1816, extending eastwardly from the old "northwest corner,"'
above described and established. Sullivan's line, as run and
marked in 1816, from said corner east, .to the Des Moines River,
was found not to be a due east line; but that more or less
northing should have been made in the old line. Nor is it a
straight line, as sudden deviations amounting to from one to
three degrees frequently occur; and it rarely happens that any
two consecutive miles pursue the same direction. It also appears, that, if the whole line was reduced throughout to a
straight line, its southing would be about two degrees from a
due east line.
The length of this line is one hundred and fifty miles fiftyone chains and eighty links, from the old northwest corner to
the western bank of the Des Moines River. At the end of
each intermediate space of ten miles, on tracing Sullivan's line
from the old northwest corner eastwardly, cast-iron pillars were
planted, of a similar description to those erected in the western
part of the line between the old northwept corner and the
monument near the Missouri River. These pillars were planted in Sullivan's line as found at the particular point; but as
the line was bending in the ten mile spaces between the pillars, it was found necessary to erect wooden posts, at the termination of each mile, in order to mark the line with more
accuracy. In the prairies the mile posts are marked with the
letters "B. L." facing the east, the letter " I." facing the north,
and the letter " M." facing the south; and the number of the
mile is marked on the west face of the post. Where. timber

exists, the number of the mile is marked on witness-trees
or pointers, with the letter appropriate to each State; there
being one tree marked on each side of the line, whenever it
was possible so to do. The foot of each witness-tree is marked
with the letters B. L.
In all cases where posts are set in mounds, the pit is invariably nine links wvesi, to designate it from other surveys.
At the end of the one hundred and fiftieth mile, no iron pillar was planted, because at fifty-one chains west of this point,
the Des Moines River was reached; and there, according to
our former decree, a large monument was planted, of similar
description to that placed at the old noithwest corner, with the
words "State line" facing the west, the word " Missouri"
facing the south, and the word "Iowa" facing the north.
And the re-marking of Sullivan's line as above set forth,
partly with woo.den posts at the termination of each mile, having been submitted to the counsel of the parties, it was by
them deemeil sufficient, because the public surveys of the
lands of the United States are to be governed and closed on
said line as run by the commissioners; and therefore -private
titles will be established on both sides, the State line being
the dividing boundary of such private rights. And in these
views of the counsel 'the court concurs. It is therefore adjudged, and decreed that Sullivan's line is established to run
through the wooden mile posts and the cast-iron pillars planted
ten miles apart on said lihe; and that fhe true and proper dividing line between the States of Missouri.and Iowa, east of
the monument erected at the "old northwest corner," begins
atohe centre of said monument, and runs eastwardly, (southing
about two degrees of a trae east line,) through the centre of
each wooden post and'iron pillar, to the centre of the monument erected on the bank of the Des Moines River. And it is
further adjudged and decreed, that a straight line from one
mile post to another, and from a mile post to a pillar; and
from the last mile post to the monument on the bank of the
Des Moines River, is the true and proper line, and that 'such
straight line shall conclude all other marks. And it is further
adjudged and decreed, that a line extended north eighty-seven
degrees thirty-eight minutes east, from the centre of the monument erected on the bank of the Des Moines River to the
middle of said river, is the true and proper boundary line befteen the tates of Missouri and Iowa west of said monurrient.
And this court having had submitted to its consideration
what amount of compensation should be allowed to the dif-"
ferent commissioners, and to the surveyors employed by them,
for services performed in running and marking the line in con-

troversy; and also the amount of expenses incurred in performing the duties imposed on said commissioners by our former decree; and these matters having been referred to the
clerk of the court to 'ascertain the proper compensation and
charges, and he having reported thereon; -and also on other
costs and charges incident to the suit: and said report not
being excepted to, is in all things confirmed, and which report
is in the words and figures following, to wit: To

THE: HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE AND ASsOCIATE JUSTICES
OF THE SUPRE1IE COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

Pursuant to an order of this honorable court made the 12th
instant, in the case of the State of Missouri and the State of
Iowa, now pending on bill and cross bill, the undercigned, after a careful examintion of witnesses and all the sources of
information within his reach, respectfully reports :1. That the $ 8 per diem, which the commissiounei agfeed
to pay each of the surveyors in the field, is a fair and reasonable compensation for their labors.
2. That $10 per day to each of the three commissioners
while engaged in this duty is a fair and reasonable compensa.
tion for their services; - and that a further per diem of $ 2 to
each of the two commissioners engaged in the field would be
a reasonable and proper allowance on account of their personal
expenses.
3. That the stalement of the expenditures by the commissioners, and of their purchases, appears to be very moderate
and reasonable.
4. That the whole expense of the survey amounted to
$10,880.41.
5. That each of the said States advanced $ 2,000.
6. That the commissioners realized from sales of camp furniture $ 13.15.
7. That the instruments purchased by the commissioners for
the survey (which cost $ 247.22) have been retained by them
for safe keeping, subject to the order of this courL
8. That-the fees now due to the clerk of this court, and up
to this term, by both parties in this case, amount to $ 48.67.
Lastly,. That in a detailed account, stated upon the- preceding basis and hereto appended, each of the said States is
charged with $ 3,457.96, being a moiety of the balance
($ 6,867.26) due on the survey, and a moiety of the fees
( 48.67) now due the clerk of this court.

HENRY WEBSTER, PLAINTIFF, V. PETER UOOPER.

*Where it appears that the whole case has been certified pro fina,in order to take
the opinion of this court, without any actual, division of opinion in the Circuit
Court, the practice is irregular, and the case must be remanded to the Circuit Court
to be proceeded in according to law.
The decision of this court in the case of Nesmith and others v. Sheldon (6 Howard, 41) affirmed.

Tis case came up on a certificate of division of opinion,
pro forma, between the judges of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Maine.
It was a real action, in which the plaintiff demanded a certain parcel of land situated in Pittston, in the county of. Kennebec and State of Maine, and claimed title under the will of
one Florentius Vassal, made in England in 1777.
Most of the points of division certified arose upon the construction of this will, and the remainder were upon the right of
the plaintiff to maintain the action, and the rule of 6stimation
as to improvements covering in fact the whole case.
The cause was argued by Mr. Dexter and Mr. B. H. Daveis,
for the plaintiff, and Mr. Allen, for the defendant; but as no
decision was had upon the merits, the arguments of counsel
are omitted.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the court.
This case has been argued at the bar upon points certified
as upon a division of opinion in the Circuit Court. But it appears by the record that the whole case has been divided into
points and sent up to this court, -and several of the latter
points could not have arisen on the trial until tHe previous ones
were first decided. We understand it was a pro forma division,
certified at the request of the counsel for the respective parties.
