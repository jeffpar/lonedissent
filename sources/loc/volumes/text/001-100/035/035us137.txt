ELLIOTT V. SAMUEL SWARTWOUT.

Under tne act of Congress passed on the 14th of July, 1832, entitled " An act to alter
and amend the several acts imposing duties on imports," worsted shawls with cotton
borders, and worsted suspenders with cotton straps or ends, are not subjected to a
duty of fifty per centum ad valorem.
Laws imposing duties on importation of goods, are intended for practica use and application by men engaged in commerce; and hence it. has become a settled rule in
the interpretation of statutes of this description, to construe the language adopted
by the legislature, and particularly in the denomination of articles, according to the
commercial understanding of the terms used.
A collector' of the revenue is not personally liable in an action to recover back an ex
cess of duties paid, as collector, and by him in the regular or ordinary course of his
duty paid into the treasury of the United States; he, the collector, acting in good
faith, and under instructions from the treasury department, and no protest being
made at the time of payment, or notice not to pay the money overiorintention to sue to
recover back the amount given, him.
In case of a voluntary payment by mere mistake of law, no action will lie to recover
back the money. The construction of the law is, open to both parties, and each
presumed to know it.
Any instructions of the treasury department to the collector, could not change the law,
or affect the rights of a party injured by them. He was not bound to take and, adopt
that construction. He was at liberty to judge for himself and act accordingly.
These instructions from the treasury seem to be thrown into the question in this case
for the purpose of showing, beyond all dovht, that the collector acted in good faith.
To make the collector answerable, after he had paid.over the mon'ey, without any intimation having been given that the duty was not legally charged, cannot be sustained upon any sound principle of policy or of law. There can be no hardohip in requiring the party to give notice to the collector, that he considers the duty claimed
illegal; to put him on his Ruard, by requiring him not to pay over the money. The
collector would then be placed in a situation to claim an indemnity from the government. But if the party is entirely silent, and no intimation of an intention to
seek a repayment of the money, there can be no ground upon which the collector
can retain the money, or call upon the government to indemnify him against a suit.
It is no sufficient answer to this that the party cannot sue the United States. It is
the case of a voluntary payment under a mistake of law, and the money paid over
into the treasury ; and if any redress is to be had, it must be by application to the

favor of the government, and not on the ground of a legal right.
The collector is personally liable in an action to recover back an excess of duties paid to
him as collector, and by him paid over in the regular and ordinary course of his

duty into the.treasury of the United States, he, the collector, acting in good faith,
and under instructions from the treasury department, a notice having been given
him at the time of payment, that the duties were charged too high, and that the part
paying, so paid to get possession of hisgoods, and intended to sue, to recover back th
amount erroneously paid ; and a notice not to pay over the amount into the treasury
VOL. X.-S

SUPREME COURT.
It is the settled doctrine of the law, that where money is illegally demandeded and received by an agent, he cannot exonerate himself from personal responsibility by
paying it over to his principal, when he has had notice not to pay it over.

ON a certificate of division from the circuit court of the United
States for the southern district of New York.
The suit was originally instituted in the superior court of the
city of New York, by the plaintiff against the defendant, the collector of the port of New York; and vv as removed by certiorari
into the circuit court of the United States.
The action was assumpsit, to recover from the defendant the
sum of thirty-one hundred dollars and seventy-eight cents, received by him for duties, as collector of the port of New York, on an
importation of worsted shawls with cotton borders, and worsted
.suspenders with cotton straps or ends. The duty was levied at
the rate of fifty per centum ad valorem, under the second clause
of the second section of the act of the 14th of July, 1832, entitled
"An act to alter and amend the several acts imposing duties on
imports," as manufactures of wool, or of which wool is a component part. The plea of non assumpsit was pleaded by the defendant in bar of the actioh
The following points were presented during the progress of
the trial for the opinion of the judges; and on which the judges
were opposed in opinion:
First. Upon the trial of the cause, it having been proved
that the shawls imported, and upon which ihe duty of fifty per
centum ad valorem had been received, were worsted shawls
with cotton borders sewed on; and that the suspenders were
worsted with cotton ends or straps; and that worsted was made
out of wool by combing, and thereby became.a distinct article,
well known in commerce under the denomination of worsted.
The judges were divided in opinion whether the said shawls
and suspenders were or were not a manufacture of wool, or, of
which wool is a component part, within the meaning of the words
-all other manufactures of wool, or which wool is a component
part,' in the second article of the second section of the act of
Congress of the 14th of July, 1832.
Second. Whether the collector is personally liable in an
action to recover back an excess of duties, paid to him ais collec.

JANUARY TERM 1836.
(Elliott v, Swartwout,]

tor; and by him, in the regular or ordinary course of his duty,
paid into the treasury of the United States ; he, the collector,
acting in good faith, and under instructions from the treasury
department, and no protest being made at the time of payment,
or notice not to pay the money over, or intention to sue to recover back the amount given him.
Third. Whether the collector is personally liable in an action to recover back an excess of duties paid to him as collector,
and by him. paid, in the regular and ordinary course of his duty,
into the treasury of the United- States, he, the collector, acting
in good, faith, and under instructions from the treasury department; a notice having been given, at the time of payment, that
the duties were charged too high, 'and that the party paying, so
paid, to get possession of his goods; and intended to sue to recover back the amount erroneously paid, and a notice not to pay
over the amount into the treasury."
These several points of disagreement were certified to this
court by the direction of the judges of the circuit court.
The ease wais argued by Mr. Ogden for the plaintiff, and by
Mr. Butler, attorney-general, for the defendant.
Mr. Ogden stated, that the question on the first point.arose
under the second clause of the second section of the act of Congress of 14th July, 1832, "to alter and amend the several acts
imposing duties on imports." The language of that part of the
section, after enumerating a number of articles on which a specific duty is laid, is" and upon merino shawls made of wool, or
of which wool is a component part, and on ready-made clothing,
fifty per cent. ad valorem." In the act, a duty of ten per cent.
ad valorem is laid "on worsted stuff goods, shawls, and other
mapnifactures ofrsilk and worsted, and on worsted yarn,' twenty
per cent. ad valorem."
It is contended that the artieles imported by the plaintiff do
not come under the provision of the law which imposes a duty
of fifty per cent. ad valorem on woollen goods; but that the duty
is ten per cent. ad valorem, as they are worsted goods, or goods
of which worsted is the principal component material,

SUPREME COURT.
(Elliott v. Swartwout.]

Congress draw a distinction between worsted and woollen
goods. These articles are worsted suspenders, with cotton ends.
The shawls are worsted shawls, with cotton borders. Worsted
is made of wool, but it undergoes a particular process of carding
and combing. It becomes, by the process, "a distinct article."
The certificate of the judges states the fact, that although
worsted "is made out of wool, by combing it becomes a distinct
article, known in commerce under the denomination of worsted."
Congress are to be considered as using terms of art and commercial terms, as they are generally used and generally understood.
This has been so decided in this court, in the case of the United
States v. 200 chests of tea, 9 Wheat. -230. The question in that
case was, whether certain tea was bohea tea. It was proved
that the tea was, in the common language of commerce, called
bohea tea; although it was not in truth so called in the country
from which it was brought. If this settles 'the law of the case,
it decides the question in the case before the court: for the articles upon which the higher duties are claimed,'are not "1wool"
but " worsted," and well known in commerce under this denomination. It will then be for this court-to'say, on the first point;
whether the articles are wool or worsted
The second point presents thequestion of the personal responsibility of the collector, on-the payment of.duties to him vhich
he has illegally exacted. The (dties thus demanded were paid
by compulson.'-Unless paid, the goods'would not have been delivered to the owner, and thus this became a compulsory payment.* If the duties were not. due, their payment gives no right
to retain them.
3. The payment of the illegal duties gave the collector no
right to them, and. the collector cannot discharge himself by paying over the money. .1 Camp. N. P. 396. This was a case in
which nwoney was illegally claimed by overseers, and was paid
over to their successors ; but they were not protected from personal responsibility by the payment. If it was illegally demanded,
it was illegally paid over by the collector. But in the point certified, the fact of a notice having been given that the duties were
too high charged, is-stated;and the collector was informed that
an action would be brought against him to recover back the

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

amount erroneously paid. It is a general principle of law, that,
under such circumstances, the money may be recovered back.
The attorney-general, Ar. Butler, for the defendant.
On the first point it is insisted, on the part of the defendant,
that the shawls and suspenders were a manufacture of wool, or
of which wool, was a component part, within the meaning of the
words " all other manufactures of wool, or of which wool is a
component part," in the second article of the second section of
the act of congress of the 14th of July 1832. Laws of the United
States, sessions 1832, p. 187. In support of which view of the
subject, the following reasons are suggested, viz :
1. The articles in question do not come within the third article
Af the section above referred to, and are not manufactures of
cotton, or of which cotton is a component part; and therefore
subject oaly to a duty of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem : but
as the cotton borders and cotton straps are merely adjuncts or
accessaries to the shawls and suspenders the entire aticle is
liable to the rate of duty imposed upon that component part,
which is most essential for the formation of the entire article,
and is of the greatest intrinsic value.
2. The duties upon the articles in question are therefore to
be determined solely by the words and intention of the second
Irticle of said second section ; and as shawls and suspenders are
not specifically enumerated, it is respectfully insisted, that they
come within the general concluding clause.
.
.
3. The tariff act of May 22, 1824, § 1, vol. vii. p. 269, shows
he understanding 6f congress, in their legislation upon the subject, to be, that worsted goods are woollen goods; else, why
except worsted goods, eo nomine ? for if they were not to be
deemed woollen, they couldnot be included in a general clause
relative to woollen, and the exception would be surplusage.
Worsted goods, although made of wool which has undergone a
different process, to wit, combing, from wool employed in various other manufactures; are still manufactures of wool. The case
admits that it is wool prepared to a certain state ; and until it can
be shown that any other raw material, as cotton, flax, &c. is
usually manufactured into- the intermediate stage denominated

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

worsted, then it follows that worsted can have no existence, ex'cept as a manufacture of wool.
4. Whatever weight might, in a case of doubtful construction,
be attached to the. consideration, that worsted being made out of
wool by combing, "thereby became a distinct article, well
known in commerce under the denomination of worsted," no
understanding, either of merchants or others, can countervail
either the express language of a statute, or the meaning'of the
legislature to be derived from the language they have employed.
The language and intention of the statute are so explicit as to
preclude the admission of extrinsic evidence for settling their
interpretation. In The United States v. Clarke, 5 Mason, 32.
Judge Story clearly understands that an article composed of
worsted is "1a fabric of which wool is a component material."
Fawv v. Marsteller, 2 Cranch 23, shows that the general words
of a law are not to be restrained by implication, "1unless that
implication be very clear, necessary, and irresistible." The
United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 386. "Where the intent is
plain, nothing is left to construction."
5. If congress had intended to discriminate between woollen
and worsted, they would, in some manner, have expressed their
intention, either by enumerating all the specific worsted articles
subject to duty; or by introducing a general clause relative to
worsted similar to that respecting woollen.
6. It is encumbent on the plaintiff to show that these goods
were expressly excepted by some special provision of the law
from the operation of the general clause ; if no such exception
shall be shown, these articles necessarily fall within the general
clause, aid are subject to a duty of fifty per cent.
7. Shawls and suspenders are not worsted stuff goods, within
the meaning of the second article ; as the term worsted stuff
good.? applies only to articles krown in commerce as piece goods,
and such as are sold by the yard.
On the second poirt, it is insisted, on the part of the de fendant, that a collector of the customs is not personally liable
in ati action to recover back an excess of duties paid to him as'
collector; and, in.the regular ordinary course of his duty, paid
into the treasury of the United States; he, the collector, acting

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

in good faith, and under instructions from the treasury department, and no protest being made at the time oT payment, and no
notice not to pay the moiley over, or intention to sue to recover
back the amount paid, given him. Because,
1. No action lies to recover back money paid voluntarily, and
without compulsion, where the party receiving the money is not
guilty of fraud, and where both parties are equally cognizant of
the facts upon which their rights depend. Gower v. Popkin,
2 Starkie 85; Fowler v. Shearer, 7 Mass. Rep. 14; Bilbie v.
Lumley, 2 East. Rep. 469.
, 2. The collector being merely an agent, no action to recover
back money will lie against him; in those cases in which an agent
of any other description or character would not be liable.
3. An agent's liability to-refund does not extend beyond that
of his principal, where the payment has been made directly to
him. Therefore, a voluntary and bona fide payment to an agent
is the same, as regards the rights of the claimant, as if the payment had been made to the principal himself. It is money had
and received by the agent to the use of his principal;and not of
the party paying it.
4. The money having been received by the collector, in good
faith , and having been paid over by him to the treasury, in the
regular course of his duty, without protest or notice from the
plaint:{f';ie is not liable to the plaintiff, even admitting that a
voluntary an& bona fide payment to the principal may, under any
circumstances, be revoked. Saddler v. Evans, 4 Burr. 1985;
Buller v. Harrison, Cowp. a65; Stevenson v. Mortimer, Cowp.
806.
5. The collector, being a revenue officzr, cannot be called on
to refund money which he has bona fide received in his official
capacity; even if an ordinary agent might, under similar circumstances, be required to refund. An action for money had
and received will not lie against a revenue officer for an overpayment. Whitebread V. Brooksbank, Cowp. 69.
6. The present action is, in effect and substantially, an action
to try a right; that is, the right of the United States to claim
duties upon certain goods, at a higher rate than admitted by the
importer. A question of this nature, so far from being triable

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.J

in an action against the agent, cannot be introduced in an action
for money had and received, wherein the person paying and the
principal are the immediate parties. Lindon v. Hooper, Cowp.
414; Staplefield v. Yewd, Bull' N. P. 133 ; Potter v. Beriniss
I Johns. Rep. 515.
On the third point, it is insisted, on the part of the defendant,
that the collector is not personally liable in an action to recover
back an excess of duties paid to him as collector, and by him
paid in the regular and ordinary course of his duty into the
treasury of the United States ; he, the collector, acting in good
faith, and under instructions from the treasury department, a no-.
tice having been given at the time of payment, that the duties
were charged too high, and-that the party paying, so paid to get
possession of his goods, and intended to sue to recover back the
amount erroneously paid, and a notice not to pay over the amount
into the treasury.
.The general propositions presented under the second point
are filly applicable to the present; and it is therefore unnecessary to reiterate them, iurther than as may be necessary to show
their applicability to this head.
The additional facts presented by this THIRD point do not vary
the result, to which it is respectfully insisted the court must
arrive, upon-a consideration of the questions arising under the
second point.
These additional facts do not vary such result, for the following reasons:
1. It was a voluntary payment; because the party making it
was apprized, at the time, of his right to resist, or withhold payment; as the case expressly states, it was at the time of payment
that notice was given that the duties were charged too high, and
that the party paying'so paid to get possession of his goods; intended to sue to recover back the amount erroneously paid, and
gave a notice not to pay over the amount into the treasury.
Brown v. McKinally, I Esp. Rep. 279; Greenway v. Hurd, 4
Term Rep. 553; Fulham v. Down, 6 Esp. Rep. 25 n; Mowatt
v. Wright, I Wendell 355.
2. The plaintiff's notice of an intention to sue to recover back
the amount erroneously paid, is inconsistent with the previous

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[(Elliott v. Swartwout.]

part of his notice, as stated in the case, to wit, " that the duties
-were charged too high." He was cognizant of all his rights
both in fact and in law, and,if believing he was under no obligation to pay the money, he notwithstanding paid it, it is still a
mere voluntary payment; for which, if he eould have no claim
against the princi.al, still less can he demand-restitution of the
agent.
3. Both parties were acting in good faith, and supposing that
they understood their mutual rights. The plaintiff believing
that he was not bound to pay duties at the rate demanded, and
the collector believing that he was entitled to demand and receive at that rate, the plaintiff not'./ithstanding pays the demand.
All pretence then of ignorance on the one part, of his rights,
and of fraud and bad faith on the other, being expressly negatived; has the plaintiff shown any additional circumstance on
which to support his action ? It is merely stated that "he so
paid to get possession of his goods."
4. It is not denied that an illegal and compulsory payment
may be the foundation of an action ; but the payment must be
both illegal and, compulsory: admitting then that the collector
misconstrued the law; or to speak more correctly, that he applied
the law, as it had been construed by his official superiors; yet,
in the absence of mala fides, it is necessary for the plaintiff to
show fully and satisfactorily, that the payment was compulsory.
It is not enough. to allege that he paid the money to get possession of his goods; but he must show that the immediate possession of the goods was so necessary and urgent as not to admit
the delay of a judicial or authoritative decision on the right.
Ashley v. Reynolds, Str. 916. That a party might protect himself by a replevin ; is an answer to an action for money had and
received, under threat of a distress for rent, 1 Esp. Rep. 84.
The circumstance that in this case the plaintiffs had an option
to give a bond for the duties, in a suit upon which the validity
of the demand could have been put in issue ; repels all idea that
this was a compulsory payment.
5. Admitting that a party payingjloney to an agent under
misapprehension, either of fact or law; may, after becoming
aware of the mistake, treat the agent as a mere stake-holder, and
VOL. X.-T

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

suspend the money in his hands, by a notice not to pay it over;
yet in this instance there was no notice within the scope and
meaning of the rule allUded to. The notice given was simultaneous with the payment; whicb was made knowingly and deliberately, and was received fairly and honestly. The cotemporaneous notice or protest, therefore, does not render it the less
a voluntary payment.
6. Admitting that a notice given subsequent to payment,
would, in the case of an ordinary agent or factor, detain the money in his hands ; the rule does not apply to a ministerial officer
of the government, who is bound to pay the money "in the
regular and ordinary course of his duty into the treasury of the
United States," and who has actually so paid it, See act March
2,1799, § 21; 3 Laws U. S., p. 157. Upon receipt of it by
him, he was, as regards the payer, functus officio. If he refuses or neglects to pay it into the treasury ; the treasury alone
can require it of him, and the payer must look to the government for reimbursement.
7. The collector is not an agent or factor, within the usual understanding of the term. He i:i
a mere ministerial officer bound
to receive what the law and the instructions of his superior require him to receive, and bound to pay over when, in what
manner, and to whom the law and those instructions may direct.
The peculiar character of a collector, as different and distinct
from that of an ordinary agent, will clearly appear from an examination of the act of March 2, 1799, § 62, 65; 3 Laws U. S.,
193, 198. Hehas iao common law lien, either general or special,
upon the funds in his hands. If a collector is liable to an action
in a case like this, as well may a suit be brought against a merchant's clerk, who has received money on his master's account,
to which the latter was not entitled.
8. Although it is not pretended that the command of a superior
justifies the tort or trespass of his inferior,' still the general policy
of the law requires, that ministerial officers, and particularly officers of the revenue, should be protected where they have acted
in good faith tinder the instructions of their superior ; especially
in those instances in which the law itself exacts an implicit obedience to those instructions.

JANUARY TERM, 1836.
[Elliott v' SwartwoutI

9. Such also is the general policy of the revenue laws of the
United States; by which the direction and superintendence of the
collection of duties is expressly delegated to the treasury department.
10. If it had been the intention of the plaintiff to resist the
payment of duties, he ought, instead of paying' the amount at the
time, to have given a bond in the usual manner; and then in a
suit upon the bond, he could have shown that the duties had
been improperly liquidated. Ex parte Davenport, 6 Peters 661.
The United States v. Phelps, 8 Peters 700. As he had an option in this respect, either to pay the duties, or to secure their
amount, it follows, that the payment was voluntary ; nd there
is ,therefore no reason why he should be allowed to litigate in a
collateral action, and against a third person, questions which
could be directly raised in a direct action between the parties in
interest. If the plaintiff's object was to obtain immediate possession of his goods, and if such immediate possession was indispensable, the foregoing consideratien negatives all idea that the money was exacted by taking an undue advantage of his situation.
Mr. Ogden, in reply, contended, that the true eonstruction of
the act of congress was, that these goods were to pay no more
than the lowest duty. They were worsted-worsted stuff goods.
The language of th section could only be fairly and reasonably
so applied. The denomination of worsted, was to be carried on
to shawls, so as to read worsted shawls. The article formed by
,combing the wool, and using it so as to make worsted from it,
became essentially different from the original material. It was
the change-produced by the manufacture, which placed it on the
list of articles subjected to a lower duty. The result of this process of manufacture was the subject of regulation by congress in
another article, and a difference of duty imposed. Woollen yayn
is subject to a duty of twenty per cent., while worsted yam pays
four or four and a half per cent. Paper is made from linen ; but
paper is not linen.
Upon the question of notice : was it necessary to give the
collector notice ? The collector was bound to know the law ; and
if by law the goods were not liable to the duty he insisted upon,

148

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.j

he is'liable, and can have no right to notice. It appears that
the collector was instructed to demand the higher duties. While
obedience to his instructions might give him a full claim to indemnity on the government, he is not the! less responsible to
individuals. Such instructions are no protection to him, when
he violates the law.
It is said the case presented is that of a voluntary payment. A
voluntary payment, which can be set up to prevent a recovery
back of money paid, can only be where all the circumstances are
well known to the person paying; and where no.constraint exists,
and a free and unlimited action is permitted, to make or refuse
the payment. But in this case, the duties must be paid or bonds
given for them, or the owner could not obtain his goods. He
might be entirely ruined by not having the possession of the goods.
- He may have made contracts for their sale and delivery, the effects of a violation of which would be such as he could not sustain. The case stated in the points certified, is, that the money
was paid to get possession of the goods. This Was involuntary.
But it is said the collector was an agent. He is agent of the
law, to carry its provisions into effect. He is not an agent for
any illegal purposes ; and he is bound to disregard instructions
from the department of the government having charge of the
collection of the revenue, if they are contrary to law. If a
collector is an agent of the treasury, then he is not an agent of
the law of the land.
The collector is responsible as a principal, when he compels
the payment of duties; and he must answer to an injured individual for his actions. This is a responsibility from which he cannot escape.
A sheriff ini levying an execution, is the agent of the plaintiff,
but he cannot protect himself by this circumstance. He will not
justify his proceedings by pleading the instructions of another.
It is said this is a question of the right of the government to
compel the payment of duties.. It is not such a question ; but it
is one whether the government has a right to collect excessive duties: whether, under the right to collect and compel
the payment of actual duties, too much, more than the law authorizes, shall be exacted. Too much has been paid in this

JANUARY TERM 1836
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

Pase, and, therefore, the action for money had and received is
proper.
The suggestion that there was another remedy, that of an aetion
of replevin, is not correct. Replevin would not lie. The right
of the United States to retain the goods sUbject to duties, is indisputable ; and until this lien is removed by the payment of the
saine; although 'the amount may not be certainly ascertained ; the
lien continties, and assures to the United States the absolute
custody of them.
'Nor is it admitted that a bond could have been given. The
delivery of a bond would have been an admission that the goods
were woollen goods; and thus the plaintiff would have been estopped from saying they were worsted. Without such a bond,
the goods could not have been obtained ; which would have
been a surrender of the claim in this suit. But two modes of
proceeding were presented. Either to take the goods, paying
the duties claimed, and to institute an action to recover back the
excess ; or to let them remain in the hands of the collector.
Had an action of trover been resorted to, years would elapse
belbre the termination of the suit : and, in the mean timc, all the
consequences of being kept out of the property would have been
sustained. An application to Congress for redress night have
been attended with the same delay.
The laws of the United States prescribe the form of !)onds for
duties ; anti although the dese iption of the goods is not inserted
in the bond, it is founded on an entry in which they are described ; and, in this case, the deicndant would have required they
uhould be entered as woollen goods.
The attorney-general referred the,,court to the 62d section of
the act of cona,'ess foir the collection of duties. The provisionb
of this section, taken in connexion with those' of the 65th section, provide for the correction of errors in the computation of
dulies. This court decided, in Davcnport's case, 6 Peters, that
these piovisimons ate to be liberally construed. In 8 Peters 700,
[he couit decided that a.party was not estopped, by giving a bond,
fiona claiming a i eduction or alteration in the computation of the
duties.

ISO

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

Mr. Justice TioIPsoN delivered the opinion of the Court.
This is an action of assumpsit torecover from the defendant
the sum of three thousand one hundred dollars and seventy-eight
cents, received by him for duties as collector of the port of New
York, on an importation of worsted shawls with cotton borders,
and worsted suspenders with cotton straps or ends. The duty was
levied at the rate of 50 per centum ad valorem, under the second
article of the second section of the act of the 14th of July, 1834,.
entitled " An atct -to alter and amend the several acts imposing
duties on imports," as manufactures of wool, or of which wool
was a component part. Upon the trial of the cause, it appeared
that the shawls imported, and upon which the duty of 50 per
centum ad valorem had been received, were worsted shawls With
cotton borders sewed on ; and that the suspenders were worsted
with cotten ends or straps. And it appeared in evidence, that
worsted was made out of wool, by combing, and thereby become
a distinct article, well.known in commerce under the denomination of worsted, and upon the trial, the judges were divided in
opinion upon the following questions :

notice having been given him at the time of payment, that the
duties were charged too high, and that the party paying, so paid
to get possession of his goods, and intended to sue, to recover
back the amount erroneously paid, and a notice not to pay over
the amount into the treasury.
1. Theact of 1832, in the gection under which this question
arises, after imposing a specific duty on a number of enumerated
articles, concludes in these words: " and upon merino shawls
made of wool, all other manufactures of wool, or of which wool
is a component part, and on ready-made clothing, 50 per centum
ad valor em." And the only question underthis point is, whether
worsted shawls with cotton borders, and worsted suspenders
with cotton ends or straps, are manufactures of wool, or of which
wool is a component part. It is stated in the point, as a fact,
and to be taken in connexion with the question, that worsted is
made out of wool by combing; but that- it becomes thereby a distinct article, well known in commerce under the denomination
of worsted.
Laws imposing duties on importations of goods, are intended
for practical use and application by men engaged in commerce;
and hence it has become a settled rule in the interpretation of
statutes of this description, to construe the language adopted by
the legislature, and particularly in the denomination of articles,
according to the commercial understanding of the terms used.
This rule is fully recognised and established by this court, in the
case of two hundred chests of tea, reported in 9 Wheat. 438.
The court there say, the object of the duty laws is to raise revenue,
and for this purpose to class substances according to the general
usage and known denominations of trade. Whether a particular
article was designated by one name or another, in the country of
its origin ; or whether it were a simple or mixed substance; was
of no importance in the view of the legislature. It applied its
attention to the description of articles, as they derived their appellations in our own markets, in our domestic as well as our
foreign traffic ; and it would have been as dangerous as useless,
to attempt any other classification than that derived from the
actual business of human life. It being admitted, in this case.
that worsted is a distinct article, well known in commerce under

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

that denomination, we must understand congress as using the
term in that commercial sense, and as contradistinguished from
wool, and woollen goods, and other well-known denomination
-of goods. The classification of the article in this section, shows
that congress had in view a class of goods known as worsted
goods. as contradistinguished from wool, and upon which a different duty is laid. A duty of ten per cen'tum ad valorem is laid
on worsted stuff goods, shawls, and other' manufactures of silk.
and worsted, and on worsted yarn, twenty per centum ad valorem. If, because worsted is made of wool, all manufactures of
worsted become woollen manufactures, there would be no propriety in enumerating worsted goods as a distinct class.
Suppose the shawls, in this case, had been without borders;
they would then have been entirely composed of worsted. It
could not, certainly, in such case, be pretended that they were
manufactures of-wool, if there-is any distinction b *tween worsted
and wool. Nof.would they be a manufacture of which-wool is
a component part. Such manufactures are, where the article is
,composed of different materials compounded ; but. these shawls,
without the borders, would be entirely worsted, and no compound. of different inateials. And if the shawls, without the
borders, would lie worsted, and not woollen goods, the addition
of a cotton border'would not make them woollenr. If the border
had been ,wool insteud of cotton, it might with some propriety
be said, thatwoolwas a component part. But adding cotton to
worsted, cannot with any propriety be said to make the article
woollen. The same remarks may be applied to the suspenders;
adding- cotton ends or straps to worsted suspenders, cannot make
them-woollen goods.
'Li, view of the case, would b an answer to the question as
put in the point.. The court is not called upon , to say what is
the duty imposed by th, law upon.these articles, but only to say
whethei, they are subject to a duty of fifty per centum ad valo-.
rein, as manufactures of wool, or of which wool ig a component
part., Bit as this question may arise upon t)e-rial, it is proper
for the court to express an opinion-upon it. The question is
certainly, as it re-spects the suspenders, not free frim difficulty.
The language of the act is obscure, and not suscoptible of an in-

JANUARY TERM 1886.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

terpretation entirely satisfactory. There is no part of this section that will cover the goods in question, except that which imposes a duty of ten per centum ad valorem on worsted stuff goods,
shawls, and other manufactures of silk and worsted. This duty
is imposed upon shawls of some description, and none but
worsted, would at all answer the denomination. Merino shawls,
made of wool, are specifically enumerated and made subject to a
duty of fifty per centum.. The clause imposing the. duty on
worsteds may well admit of reading "worsted stuff goods and
worsted shawls ;" they are certainly not a manufacture of worsted
and silk. It might be a proper subject of inquiryupon the trial,
whether shawls of this description are usually denominated
worsted shawls in the market, and if so, the rule of construction
alluded to, would apply to the case* At all events, the answer
to be given to the question as put, must be, that the shawls and
suspenders are not a manuf~cture of wool, or of Which wool isa
component part.
2. The case put in the second point, is where the collector
has received the money in the ordinary and rcgular course of his
duty, and has paid it over into the treasury, and no objection
made at the time of payment, or at any time before the money
was paid over to the United States, The manner in which the
question is here put, presents the case of a purely
voluntary payment, without objection or noticL -not-to pay over the money,
or any declaration made to -the collector of an intention to prosecute him to-recover back the money. It is therefore to be considered as a voluntary payment, by mutual mistake of law; and,
in such case, no action will lie to recover back the money, The
construction of the law is open to both parties, and each presumed to know it. 'Any instructions from the treasury department could not change the law, or affect the rights of the plaintiff.
He was not bound to take, and adopt that construction. He was
at liberty to judge for himself, and act accordingly. These instructions from the treasury seem to be thrown into the question
for the purpose of showing, beyond all doubt, that the collector
acted in good faith. To make the collector answerable, after he
had paid over the money, without any intimation having been
given that the duty was not legally charged, cannot be sustained
VOL. X.-u

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

upon any sound principles of policy or of law. There can be
no hardship in requiring the party to give notice to the collector
that he considers the duty claimed. illegal, and put him on his
guard, by requiring him not to pay over the money. The col.
lector would then be placed in a situation to claim an indemnity
from the government. But if the party is entirely silont, and no
intimation of an intention to seek a lepayment of the money;
there can be no ground upon which the collector can retain the
money, or call upon the government to indemnify him against a
suit. It is no sufficient answer to this that the party cannot sue
the United States. The case put in the question, is one where
no suit would lie at all. It is the case of a voluntary payment
under a mistake of law, and the money paid over into the treasury.:
and if any redress is to be had, it must be by application to the
favor of the government, and not on the ground of a legal right.
The case of Morgan v. Palmer, 2 Barn. and Cres. 729, was an
action for money had and received, to recover back money paid
for a certain license ; and one objection to sustaining the action
was, that it was a voluntary payment. The court did not consider
it a voluntary paymenL, and sustained the action: but Chief
Justice Abbot, and the whole court, admitted that the objection
would have been fatal, if well-founded in point of fact. The
court said it had-been well argued, that the payment having been
voluntary, it could not be recovered back in an action for money
had and received. And in Brisbain v. Diicres, 5 Taunt. 154,
the question is very fully examined by Gibbs, justice, and most
of thecases noticed and commented upon, and with the concurrence of the whole court, except Chambre, justice, lays down
the doctrine broadly, that whei6 a man demands money of another, as matter of right, and that other, with a full knowledge
of the facts-upon which the demand is founded, has paid a sum
of money voluntarily, he cannot recover it back. It may be,
says the judge, that, upon a further view, he may form a different
opinion of the law; and it may be, his subsequent opinion may
be the correct. one. If we were to hold otherwise, many inconveniences may arise. There are many doubtful questions of:law.
When they arise, the defendant has an option either to litigate
the-question, or submit to the demand and pay the money. But

JANUARY TERM 1$36
[Elliott v. $wartwout.]

iLwould be most mischievous and unjust, if he, who has acqui.esced in the right by such voluntary payment, should be at liberty, at any time within the statute of limitations, to rip up the
matter, and recover back the money. This doctrine is peculiarly
applicable to a case where the money has been paid over to the
public treasury, as in the question no* under consideration.
Lord Eldon, in the case of Bromley v. Holland, 7 Vesey 23,
approves the doctrine, and says it is a sound principle, that a
voluntary payment is not recoverable back. In Cox v. Prentice,
3 Maul and Selw. 348, Lvrd Ellenborough says; I take it to be
clear, that an agent who receives money for his prineipal, is
liable, as a principal, so long as he stands in his original situation,
and until there has been a change of circumstances, by his having
paid over the money to his principal, or done something equivalent to it. And in Buller v. Harrison, 2 Cowp. 568, lord Mansfield says, the law is clear, that if an agent pay over money,
which has been paid. to him by mistake, he does no wrong, and
the plaintiff must call on the principal ; that if, after the payment
has been made, and before the money has been paid over, the
mistake is corrected, the agent cannot afterwards pay it over
without making himself personally liable. Here, then, is the
true distinction: when the money is paid voluntarily, and by mistake, to an agent, and he has paid it over to his principal, he
cannot be made personally responsible: but if, before paying it
over, he is 'apprized of the mistake, and required not to pay it
over, he is personally liable. The principle laid down by Lord
Ellenborough, in Townsend v. Wilson, I Campbell 396, cited
and relied upon on the part of the plaintiff, does not apply to this
case. -He says, if a person gets money into his hands illegally,
he cannot discharge himself by paying it over to another: but
the payment, in that case, was not voluntary: for, says Lord
Ellenborough, the plaintiff had been arrested, and was under
duress when he paid the money. In Stevenson v. Mortimer,
2 Cowp. 816, Lord Mansfield lays down the general principle,
that if money is paid to a known agent, and an action is brought
against the agent for the money, it is an answer to such action
that he has paid it over to his principal. That he intended, however, to apply this rule to cases of voluntary payments made by

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwvout.]

mistake, is evident from whht fell from him in Sidler v. Evans,
4 Bur. 1987. Hle there said, he kept clear of all payments to
third persons, but where it is to a known agent; in which case the
action ought to be brought against the principal, unless in special
cases, as under notice, or niala tides: which seems to be an admission that, if notice is given to the agent before the money is
paid over, such payment will not exonerate the agent. And this
is a sound distinction, and applies to the two questions put in the
second and third points in the case now before the court. In
the former, the payment over is supposed to be without notice ;
and in the latter after notice, and a request not to pay over the
money. The answer, then, to the second question is, that unde'
the facts there stated, the collector is not personally liable.
3. The case put by the third point, is where, at the time of
payment, notice is given to the collector that the duties are
charged too high, and that the party paying, so paid to get possession of his goods; and accoml)anied by a declaration to the
collector, that he intended to sue him to recover back the amount
erroneously paid, and notice given to him not to pay it over to
the treasury.
This question must be answered in the affirmative ; unless the
broad proposition can be maintained, that no action will lie
against a collector to recover back an excess of duties paid him;
but that recourse must be had to the government for redress.
Such a principle would be carrying an ex.emption to a public
officer beyond any protection, sanctioned by any principles of
law or sound public policy. The case of Irving v. Wilson and
another, (4 Term Rep. 485,) wasan action for .money had and
received, against custom-house officers, to recover back money
paid to obtain the release and discharge of goods seized, that were
not liable to seizure : and the action was sustained. Lord Kenyon observed, that the revenue laws ought not to be made the
means of oppressing the subject; that the seizure was illegal
that the defendants took the moneyuner_circumstances which
could by no possibility justify them ; And; 'therefore, this could
not be called a voluntary payment.
The case of Greenway v. Hurd, (4 Term 554,) was an action
against an excise officer, to recover back duties illegally receiv-

JANUARY TERM 1836.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.I

ed ; and Lord Kenyon does say, that an action for money had and
received will not lie against a known agent, bat the party must
resort to the superior. But this was evidently considered a case
of voluntary payment. The plaintiff had once refused to pay,
but afterwards paid the money; and thig circumstance is expressly referred to by Puller, justice, as fixing the character.of the
payment. He says, though the plaintiff had once objected to
pay the money, he seemed afterwards to waive the objection by
paying it. And Lord Kenyon e'onsidered the case as falling
within the principle of Sadler v. Evans, 4 Bur. 1984, which
has already been noticed. In the case of Snowden v. Davis,
I Taunt. 358, it was decided that an action for money had and
received, would lie against a bailiff, to recover back money paid
through compulsion, under color of process, by an excess of authority, although the money had been paid over. The court
say, the money was paid to the plaintiff, under the threat of a
distress; and although paid over to the sheriff, and by him into
the exchequer, the action well lies ; the plaintiff paid it under
terror of process to redeem his goods, and not with intent, that
it should be paid over to any one. The case of Ripley v. Gelston, 9 John. 201, was a suit against a collector to recover back
a sum of money demanded by him for the clearance of a vessel.
The plaintiff objected.to the payment, as being illegal, but paid
it for the purpose of obtaining the clearance, and the money had
been paid by.the collector into the branch bank to the credit of the
treasurer. The defence was put on the ground that the money
had been paid over, but this was held insufficient. The money,
say the court, was demanded as a condition of the clearance
and that being established, the plaintiff is entitled to recover it
back, without showing any notice not to pay it over. The
cases which exempt an agent do not apply. The money was
paid by compulsion. It was extorted as a condition of giving a
clearance, and not with intent or purpose to be paid over. In
the case of Clinton v. Strong, 9 John. 369, the action was to recover back, certain costs, which the marshal had demanded on
delivering up a vessel which had been seized, which' costs the
court considered illegal; and one of the questions was whether
the payment was voluntary. The court said the payment, could

SUPREME COURT.
[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

not be voluntary-. The costs were exa cted by the officer, colore
officii,-as a condition of the redelivery of the property ; and that it
would lead to the greatest abuse to hold that a payment under
such circumstances, was a voluntary payment precluding the
party from contesting it afterwards. The case of Hearsey v.
Pryn, 7 John. 179, was an action to recover back toll which had
been illegally demanded ;and Spencer, justice, in delivering the
opinion of the court, says the law is well settled, that an action
may be sustained against an agent who has received money, to
which the principal had no right, if the agent has had notice not
to pay it over. And in the case of Fry v. Lockwood, 4 Cowen456, the court adopts the principle, that when money is paid to
an agent for the purpose of being paid over to his principal, and
is actually paid over, no suit will lie against the agent to recover
it back. But the distinction taken in the case of Ripley v. Gelston,
is recognised and adopted; that the cases which exempt an
agent when the money is paid over to his principal without notice, do not apply to cases where the money is paid by compulsion, or extorted as a condition, &c. From this view of the
cases, it may be assumed as the settled doctrine of the law, that
where money is illegally demanded and received by an agent,
he cannot exonerate himself from personal-responsibility by paying it over to his principal; if he has had notice not to pay it
over.' The answer, therefore, to the thirid point must be, that
the collector is personally liable to an action to recover back an
excess of duties *paid to him as collector, under the circumstances
stated in the point; although he may have paid over the money
into the treasury.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record
from the circuit court of the United States, for the southern district of New York, and on'the questions on which the judges of
the said circuit court were opposed in opinion, and which were
certified to this Court. for its opinion, agreeably to the act of
congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by
counsel; on consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court,
on the first question, that the said shawls and suspenders were

JANUARY TERM 1836.

[Elliott v. Swartwout.]

not a manufacture of wool, or of which which wool was a component part, within the meaning of the words "all other manufactures of wool, or of, which wool is a component part," in the
second article of the second section of the act of congress of 14th
July, 1832.
On the second question, it is the opinion of this Court, that,
under the facts as stated in the said second question, the collector is not personally liable.
On the third question, it is the opinion of this Court, that the
collector, under the circumstances as stated. in the said question,
is liable to an action to reenver back an excess of duties paid to
him as collector, although he may have paid over the money into the treasury. Whereupon, it is ordered and adjudged by this
Court, to be so certified to the said circuit court of the United
States for the southern district of New York.
