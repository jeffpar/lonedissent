If a ship be at anchor, with no sails set, and in.a proper place for anchoring,
and another ship, under sail, occasions damage to her. the latter is liable.
But if the place of anchorage be an improper place, the owners of the vessel
which -is injured must abide the consequences of the misconduct of the
master.
In this case, the anchored vessel was in the thoroughfare of the pass of the
Mississippi river.

THIS case originated in'the District Court of the United States
for the eastern district of Louisiana, was carried, by appeal, to
the Circuit Court, and finally brought here.

SUPREME CO-URT.
Strout et al. v. Foster et al.

There was much contradictory evidence about some of the
facts. Those which were not disputed were these:
The Harriet, a ship of about,three hundred tons, sailed from
New Orleans for London on the 25th of May, 1836. On the
26th, she passed the'bar of the Southwest pass, at the mouth of
the river, and came to anchor. The ship Louisville, of five
hundred tons burden or upwards, was coming in, and a collision
ensued between the two vessels. The Harriet was so" much
damaged that she put back for repairs. Her owners, Jonathan
Strout and others, libelled the Louisville. The' District Court,
after a hearing, decreed in favour of the libellants, and against
the ship Louisville, .her tackle, apparel, and furniture, in the sum
of $2701 07, and costs of suit. The defendants appealed.
â€¢ The Circuit Court reversed the decree of the District Court,
with costs; and remanded the case to the District Court, with instructions to dismiss the libel. The libellants appealed.
-Itwas given in evidence on the trial below for the libellants,
that, on the 26th of May, 1B36, the .Harriet was at anchor near
the mouth of the Southwest pass of the Mississippi, outside the
'bar, on the western side of it,'with" her sails all furled; that. the
Louisville was also lying at anchor with her sails furled, at some
considerable distance to the eastward; that the Louisville got
under weigh, arid stood down to the Southwest pass with-all sails
-set, topsail, and jib, and spanker; that she got within a quarter
of a mile of the Harriet,, and let go .her anchor; that there was
no range. of cable overhauled; that there was not more than
enough cable to let the ahchor out of sight; that when the Louisville dropped her anchor, her sails were all set; that she came
afoul of the starboard bow of the Harriet, whose helm was hard
to starboard, and the jib' and. fore-top-mast stay-sail set to steer
cleat; that the people on board of the Harriet bore the Louisville
off,. and then she came afoul again; that they bore her off again;
that instead of the Louisville making sail aft to bring her up,
they set the fore-top-sail, and the ship paid.'off, and. came afoul
.'of the Harriet. across her bows; that aboard the Harriet they
coptinued to pay out cable, to perinit the vessel to go clear; that
there was plenty of room for the Louisville to. have passed to the
eastward of the Harriet, and a good free wind; that the Harriet
was lying out of the ustial track; that two brigs came down and

Strout et al. v. Foster et al.

went to sea to the eastward of the Harriet, after she had anchored; and that the wind was fresh from the S. E. or S. S. E.
On the part of the defendants, it was given in evidence, that
the Harriet might have gone to sea when she anchored, as there
was wind enough; that she was lying in the thoroughfare of
vessels going in and out; that when the Louisville weighed anchor to come in, there was a fresh wind and favourable for comhig in; that as she approached the bar, the wind died away;
that a strong 'current set out of the pass; .that it was stronger
than usual, in consequence of there having, been a strong wiud.
the night before from. the south; that owing to the lightness of
the wind the Louisville drifted; that there was a pilot on board
the Louisville, who said some time before, that they would be
obliged to go close to the Harrieton one side or the -other; that
as the Louisville neared the Harriet, the pilot ordered them to
let go the anchor and take in sail; that they obeyed the order as(
soon as they could; that the anchor got afoul of the chain of the
Harriet which had a great scope out; that the chain of the
Harriet was not forward of her, but off on the starboard bow;
thbat the Harriet had met with a similar accident in and about
the same place, on a former voyage; that the entrances of passes
at the mouth of the Mississippi are very intricate and' difficult,
on account of the currents and counter-currents; that as vessels
approach the bar, and the water becomes more shoal, they are
apt to become unmanageable,. particularly when the wind dies
away; that when the water, is shoal, the under-tow has a great
effect, and frequently" with the greatest efforts a vessel cannot be
steered; that there is one flood'.tide every twenty-four hours 6n
thb bar, arid, the under-tow is the consequence of the flood-tide
setting in and the current out.
The opinion of the Circuit Court, as delivered by Mr. Justice
McKINLEy, was as follows:
I This case comes before this court upon an appeal from the decree of the Districi Court for the eastern district of Louisiana.
The appellees, owners of ship Harriet, filed their libel, in the
court below, for collision, and upon the trial the court rendered a
decree in favour of the libellants, for $2701 7 cents. By the evidence it appears that the Harriet had passed over the bar through
one of the passes or outlets at the moiith of the Mississippi river,

92

SUPREME COURT.
Strout et al. v. Foster et al.

outward bound, on the 26th.of Iay, 1836, and came to anchor
near the bar. The Louisville, lying below a distance of several
miles, weighed anchor with a fresh and favourable wind for coming in,-through the same pass; as she approached the bar the
wind died away, and the current being stronger than usual, owing
to a strong wind from the south the night before, she drifted and
ran afoul of the Harriet. These passes, it appears, are intricate
and difficult to navigate, and -subject to counter and under curients. If the wind die away when a ship is coming in, she is
certain to drift and become unmanageable. Knowing these facts,
a prudent master would never anchor his vessel in the thoroughfare of one of these passes. The evidence shows, however, that
the master of the Harriet did aunhor his vessel immediately in
the thoroughfare, and that, too, after having been run afoul of by
another vessel about a year before, at or near the same place.
There are four possibilities under which a collision may occur:
First. It may happen without blame being imputable to either
party; as when the loss is occasioned by a storm, or any other
vis major. In thiat case the misfortune must .be borne by the
party on whom it happens to light, the other not being responsible to him in any degree.
Secondly. When there has been a want of due diligence or
skill on both sides, in such case the rule of law is, that the loss
must be apportioned between them, as having been occasioned
by the fault of both.
Thirdly- It may' happen- by the misconduct of the suffering
party only, and then the rule is, that the sufferer must bear his
own burden.
Lastly. It may have been the fault of the ship which run- the
other downyand in this case, the injured party would be entitled
to entire compensation froin the other. The Woodrop Sims,
2 Dodson's Rep. 83.
The third rule here laid down, it seems to me, applies with
great force to the case under consideration, the misconduct on
the part of thp master of the Harriet, .in anchoring his ship
immediately in the thoroughfare, is fully made out by the
proof; while, on the contrary,'there is no fault proved, going to
show mismanagement, want of skill, or negligence on the part of
the master of the Louisville. It is true that the opinions of some

JANUARY TERM, 1843.

93

Strout et al. i. Foster et, al.*

nautical men, found in the evidence, show that it was possitle for
the Louisville to have avoided the collision, had every thingbeen
done that it was. possible to do. But the law imposes no such
diligence on the party in this case; so far as"the Harriet was concerned, the Louisville was entitled to the full use of the thoroughfare of the pass; the master of the Harriet having obstructed it,
with a full knowledge of the danger of doing so, has'been guilty
of such misconduct as to deprive the appellees of the right of
action against the appellants.. 3 Hunt's Con. 230.
It was insisted by the counsel of the appellees, that the Harrietbeing at anchor, and the other ship under sail, that the latter was
therefore liable. It is true, if a ship be at anchor, with no sails
set and in a proper place for anchoring, and another ship under
sail occasions damage to. her, the latter is liable. But the place
where the Harriet anchored was an improper place, and therefore the appellees must abide the consequences of the misconduct
of the master. Wherefore, it is decreed and ordered that the decree of the District Court be reversed, and held for naught, and
that the appellants recover of the appellees their costs in this
behalf expended; and-it is further decreed and ordered, that this
case be remanded to the District Court, with instructions to dismiss the libel of the libellants.
,Dickins and Hellen, for the appellants.
Coxe, for the appellees.
The reporter was not present. at the argument, and has been
furnished only with the notes of Mr. Dickins.
2Dickins laid down the following propositions:.
1. The sea is a public highway.or thoroughfare, equally free
to all persons and all nations.
2. All persons navigating the high seas have an equal right to
sail through, or anchor in any portion of them.
3. All persons navigating the high seas, as aforesaid, are bound
to. take notice of all such vessels as may have come to an anchor;
and so to navigate their vessel as not to run afoul of, or otherwise
injure those at anchor.
4. If a vessel under sail runs afoul of a vessel at anchor in the
nigh seas, the vessel in motion is bound to pay all damages.
5. If the universal right of all vessels navigating the high seas
to anchor in any part thereof has been restricted, either by-law

94

SUPREME COURT.
Strout et a]. v. Foster et al.

or custom, and they are prohibited from coming to an anchor in
certain places, unless at their own risk, it is incumbent upon the
party claiming the benefit of such restriction or prohibition, to
prove its existence clearly and conclusively; and also to prove,
with equal clearness and certainty, the fact, that the vessel complained of was anchored in such prohibited place, and that all
ordinary diligence was used by those on board of the vessel in
motion, to prevent the accident; otherwise, they will not be
released. from the payment of the damages sustained by the
vessel at anchor.
6. The universal right of all persons navigating the high seas
to anchor wherever they may happen to be, or in any place they
may think proper, has never been and cannot be restricted, but
in certain particular local jurisdictibns.
7, and last. If a vessel under sah comes unawares upon one at
anchor, they are both bound to use every possible exertion to
prevent a collision; and if either is deficient in that respect, it is
bound to bear the loss: but should a vessel under sail knowingly
and voluntarily attempt to pass one at anchor, and, in so doing,
run afoul of her, ana thereby cause her to sustain loss or damage,
the vessel under sail, although she may-have used every possible
exertion to prevent the damage, but at a time when it was too
late to avoid the collision, is bound to pay all the losses sustained
in consequence thereof by the vessel at anchor.
In support of the fourth proposition, he cited Jacobsen's Sea
Laws, (edition by William Frick, in ISIS,) p. 339: "A ship,
which, under full sail, occasions damage to another 'which has no
sail set, is liable for all damages."
To sustain the fifth proposition he cited Lock v. Seward, 4 Carrington and Payne, 106; and Foot and Reynold v. Wiswall,
14 Johns. 304: and for the seventh, Jacobsen's Sea Laws, 107,

MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF *THE CITY OF MOBIAE, PLAINTIFFS, V.
J. EXANUEL AND G.*S. GAINES, DEFENDANTS.
The case of the City of Mobile v. Hallett, 16 Peters, 261, examined and confirmed.
Under the exception contained in the act of Congress of 1824, no title passed
to the city of Mobile, where the land was in the possession of a party claiming to hold it under a Spanish grant which had been confirmed by the United
States.

Txis case was brought up by writ of error, from the Sapreme
Court of the state of Alabama, under the twenty-fifth section of
the judiciary act of 1789.
The facts in the case were these:
On the 26th of September, 1807, the. Spanish governor of
Florida granted to John Forbes a tract of land immediately
adjacent to what is now the city of Mobile, and indeed constituting a part of it. The grant was founded upon, and confirmatory
of, an older one issued to Richardson in 1767, by the British
government, thei in.possession of the country. The land was
upon the west side of the river Mobile. In the document issued
