JoHN D.

MURRILL

AND

THE BANK OF NEW ORLEANS, APPELLANTS.
T. SOMERVILLE.

ALEXANDER NEILL AND WILLIAx

A merchant who owed debts upon his own private account, and was also a partner
in two commercial houses which owed debts upon partnership account, executed a
deed of trust containing the following provisions, viz.:It recited a relinquishment of dower by his wife in property previously sold and in
the property then conveyed, and also a debt due to the daughter of the grantor,
which was still unpaid, and then proceeded to declare that he was indebted to"
divers other persons residing in different parts of the United Sfates, the names of
whom he -&as then unable to specify particularly, and that'the trustee should remit,frofh time to time to Alexander Neill, of the first moneys arising from sales,
until he shall have remitted the sum of $ 15,000, to be paid by the said Neill to the
creditors of the said grantor, whose demands shall then have been ascertained;
and if such demands shall exceed the sum of $. 5,000, then to be divided amongst
such creditors parijpassu;and out of further remittances there was to be paid the
sum of $12,000 to his wife as a compensation for her relinquishment of dower,
and next the debt due to his daughter, and after that the moneys arising from
further sales werd to be applied to the payment of all the creditors of the grantor
whose demands shall then have been ascertained. In case of a surplus, it was to
revert to the grantor.
The construction of this deed must be, that the grantor intended to provide for his
private creditors only out of this fund, leaving the partnership creditors to be paid
out of the partnership funds.
Under the deed, it was the duty of the trustee to divide the first S 15,000 amongst the
private creditors of the grantor, and exclude from all participation therein the
creditors of the two commercial houses with which the grantor was connected;
next to pay the debts due to the wife and daughter; then to pay in full the private
creditors, or divide the amount amongst them, proportionally.
The rule is, that partnership creditors shall, in the first instance, be satisfied from
the partnership estate; and separate or private creditors of the individual partners
from the separate and private estate of the partners, with whom they have made
private and individual contracts; and that the private and individual property of
the partners shall not be applied in extinguishment of partnership debts, until the
separate and individual creditors of the respective partners shall be paid.
The American and'English cases respecting this rule examined.

* THis was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Maryland, under the following circumstances.
On the 24th of September, 1839, Luke Tiernan, of the city
of Baltimore, and Anne, his wife, made a deed of trust to
Charles H. Carroll, of Livingston County, New York, thereby
conveying to said Carroll about 5,888 acres of land, part of
Tuscarora Tract in said Livingston County, of which Luke
Tiernan.was seized in fee simple as his individual property.
The property so conveyed is in said deed estimated to be.worth
about $ 120,000."

JANUAR-Y TERM, 1850.

Murrill et aL v. Neill et al.

The deed, among other things, recites that Anne, the wife
of Luke, had previously joined in a conveyance of various portions of said tract, the property of said Luke, which before that
time had been sold, without receiving for her separate use any
consideration therefor.
It algo recites, that said Luke was indebted to Anne E. Brien,
at the time of her death, in the sum of $ 4,450, which on her
death became due to Luke Tiernan Brien, her only child and
heir at law.
It also. recites, that said Luke "is indebted to divers other
persohs, residing in different parts of the United States of
America, in a large amount of money in the aggregate, but the
names of all the persons to whom he is so indebted, and the
amount due to each respectively, the said Luke Tiernan is now
unable to specify particularly."
The deed then conveys said land to said Carroll in trust, to
sell and convey the same in the manner therein specified, and
after paying expenses, including a commission for his services,
to remit the net proceeds of the first moneys arising from the
sales, in bank checks or drafts, to Alexander Neill, of Maryland,
" until he shall have remitted thi sum of $ 15,000, to be paid
by the said Alexander Neill to the creditors of the said Luke
Tiernan, whose demands shall then have been ascertained; and
if the demands so ascertained shall exceed the said sum of
$ 15,000, the same shall be applied in part paymentof each of
said demands, in the ratio that each of said demands respectively shall bear to the whole sum to be so applied."
After said sum of $ 15,000 shall have been remitted, then
the sum of $ 12,000 is to be remitted by said Carroll to such
person as said Anne Tiernan may designate, which is to be invested for the sole and separate use of said Anne, as a compensation to her for relinquishing her dower in the land by the
deed conveyed.
Then the sum of $ 4,450, with interest from the 1st of January, 1841, is to be remitted by said Carroll in payment of the
above-mentioned debt due to Luke Tiernan Brien.
"And after the last-mentioned sum shall have been remitted
as aforesaid, all the residue of the moneys arising from such
sales (after deducting the expenses and commissions as aforesaid) shall be remitted by the said Charles H. Carroll from time
to time, as the same shall be received, to the said Alexander
Neill, in the manner herein before provided for the remission of
the said sum of $ 15,000, and the same shall be applied by the
said Alexander Neill to the payment of the debts due from the
said Luke Tiernan to all the creditors of the said Luke, whose

416

SUPREME COURT.
Murrill et al. v. Neill et aL

3emands shall then have been ascertained by the said Alex-ander Neill; dnd in case that the sum so to b6 applied shall be
insufficient for the payment of all such demands, then and in
this case the same shall be applied in part payment of each of
said demands, in the ratio that each of said demands respectively shall bear to the whole sum to be so applied to that
objeft; aid in case the saidsum shall be more -than equal to
the payment of such demands, then and in that case the residue
thereof shall be paid by the said Alexander Neill to the said
Luke Tiernai, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns."
The said Carroll, in pursuance of said deed, proceeded to
make sale of various parts of the property thereby conveyed,
and from time to time, from the 1st of March, 1841, to the 22d
of April, 1844, remitted to said Neill, in various amounts, the
whole sum of $ 15,000, provided to be paid in the first place to
said Neill out of the net proceeds of sales as above mentioned.
This sum increased in the hands of Neill, by interest and premiums on the drafts in which it was remitted, to $ 16,440.55.
Luke Tiernan was a partner in the commercial firm of Luke
_,Tiernan & Son, of Baltimore, the only other partner therein
being his son Charles Tiernan. This firm was dissolved previously to the death of Luke Tiernan, which occurred on the
9th of November, 1839, and after his death it was conducted
under the -same name by Charles Tiernan.
Luke Tiernan was also a partner in the commercial firms of
Luke & Charles Tiernan, and Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co., of New
Orleans, The partners of the first-named firm were Luke.and
Charles Tiernan; -and of the second, Luke Tiernan, Charles
Tiernan, Calvin Tate, aNd James McG. Cuddy.
The firm of Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co. failed in* December,
1835, for a large sum of money. iCharles'Tiernan was the
liquidating partner thereofnd was engaged from April, 1836,
to May, 1842, in collecting the- assets of the firm. He collected
about $ 100,000, the whole of which, and a good deal more, he
paid in -satisfaction of the debts of the firm. Calvin Tate, one
of the partners, applied for the benefit of the bankrupt law of the
United States on the 18th of February, 1842, and obtained his
discharge undek said application. The amount of debts returned
by him as due by Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co. was $ 569,069.49,
and the amoufnt as due to. said firm was $ 800,743.47.
On the 29th of May, 1845, the executors of Luke Tiernan,
on an account then passed by them with the Orphans' Court of
Baltimore County, had in hand a balance in cash to the amount
of $ 506.91. They conjecture that, with this balance, debts
may be collected and other assets may be realized, including

JANUARY TERM, 1850.
Murrin' et al. v. Ngeill 6-t al.

417

the entire real and personal property of said Luke, to the
amount in all of about $ 30,000. None of this amount, however, so far as appears, was ever collected, except said sum of
$ 506.91, and the entire estimate is merely conjectural.
The individual debts of Luke Tiernan, as proved and allowed
in this case, amount to $ 31,586.25.
The partnership debts of all the firms in which Luke Tiernan was concerned as a partner, as proved in this case, amount'
to $ 295,025.74.
In October, 1843, John D. Murrill, a citizen of the State of
Virginia, and the Bank of New Orleans, filed their bill in equity
against Mr. Neill, claiming from him an account of his trust
under the deed now described, and a distribution of any fund in
his hands among the creditors of Mr. Tiernan. The bill was
amended by making William T. Somerville a defendant, as
executor, along with Mr. Neill, of Luke Tiernan.
The answer of Neill admits the receipt under the deed of
15,000, increased, by interest from investment, to $ 16,440.55;
and this sum he asks may be distributed among the creditors
of Mr. Tiernan who may under ihe trust have right to it. Testimony was taken to show the insolvency, and the debts and
assets, of the partnership in New Orleans, and of Luke Tiernan. The separate estate of the latter in Maryland is shown
to have been administered, leaving only $ 506 in the hands of
the executors, and some good debts to be collected,.and some
unsalable stocks.
The court passed an order for notifying creditors of Luke
Tiernan to file their claims, and under it a number of claims
have been presented, partnership and individual, against Luke
Tiernan. The individual amount to $ 31,586.25, the partnership to $ 295,025.74.
The matters being referred to an auditor to report an account
upon the claims, he stated two accounts, one applying the fund
to payment of only the individual creditors, the other to payment of them and of the partnership creditors pan passu.
Upon exceptions taken, the court determined that the individual creditors were to be preferred, and the funds of the trust
shout'd go to their satisfaction before any payments should be
made to the partnership creditors.
The trustee was therefore dirccted to proceed to distribute
and pay over the funds accordingly. From this decree, the
complainants appealed to this court.
The case was argued by Mr. Mayer and Mr. Johnson (Attorney-General), for the appellants, and by Mr. Brown and MJIr.
M1eredith, for the appellees;

418

SUPREME COURT.
Murrill et al. v. Neill et al.

"The counsel for the appellants, contending that they were
entitled to share ratably with the individual creditors in the
fuinds proceeding from the lands conveyed, submitted these
propositions 1. There is no rule at law, nor in equity, which gives sepa
rate creditors a priority of payment over joint creditors, out of
separate estates; although the principle is well established that
joint, that is (more properly) partnership, creditors are first to
be paid out of partnership property. This principle is founded
upon the consideration that each partner is interested in the
partnership fund, and concerned to see it applied for his exoneration by its paying the common liabilitids; and it is pledged
accordingly, not only for partnership debts, in favor of partnership creditors, but from each to the other partner for the indemnity of both. The prior right of partnership claims upon the
partnership estate arises, therefore, from the nature of that
estate, in reference to the rights of the partners; and does not
grow out of any limitation of the rights or remedies of the
partnership creditors. Such being the nature of the partnership fund, it is regarded, too, as under a prior lien in favor of
the partnership creditors. The principle, then, which gives the
priority is not restrictive, but is cumulative, in furnishing a
security, by this preferred claim to the partiiership property, in
favor of partnership creditors. The rule contended for by the
appellee has reference only to the marshalling of assets, not to
the satisfaction, directly or ultimately, of the joint claims. It'
is a rule only "of convenience:"
2. Whatever may be the rule as to the distinctive appropriation of separate and joint estates of debtors, it is believed to be
clear froin the authorities, that where there is no joint estate, or
it is inadequate, or there are no solvent partners, the partnership
creditors are admitted to dividends, with separate creditors, out
of the separate estates.
3. Modern decisions in equity regard partnership claims, and
satisfy them, as jointly and severally binding the partners. In
this respect, equity follows the law, and would virtually make
the property here, under that position, legal assets. The whole
idea of separate claims having a priority upon separate estates,
arose from the impression that the partnership claims should not
be treated in equity as joint and several.
4. Whether the proceeds of sales under Mr. Tiernan's deed
be -regarded as legal or as equitable assets, the terms of the
deed demand a distribution among all creditors, without preference to any-class.
._
5. But -those proceeds are to be regarded as legal assets, and

Murrill et al. v. Neill et aL

the partnership creditors can no more rightfully be excluded
from them than they could have been denied, after judgment
against all the partners, the privilege of levying an execution
on the lands, if they had not been conveyed. So far as the
deed provides for creditors generally, it does but what the law
had ordained, in subjecting the lands to all creditor claims.
Equity here must follow the law in applying the avails of this
property. That is .the true equity.

by the trustee shall be paid to "the creditors of the said Luke
Tiernan," throws upon the appellants the onus of showing that
the creditors of the partnership firms of Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co.
and L. & C. Tiernan were meant to be included. Thomas v.

that the money in question in this case, which consists of the

that the partnership creditors of said Luke Tiernan, if embraced
at all in said deed, are secured by the subsequent part thereof,
which provides that the residue of the proceeds of sales shall
be divided among all the creditors of said Luke.
5th.- And if neither of said constructions shall be sustained
by the court, they will further maintain that said Luke Tiernan, if all his debts, both indikidual and partnership, be taken
into consideration, made said deed with reference to the rule
common both to courts of equity and bankruptcy, that individual creditors shall first be paid out of individual property, and
partnership creditors out of partnership property, and that all
the property conveyed by said deed, being the individual property of Luke Tiernan, must be applied in the first instance to
the payment of his individual debts.

Mr. Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion of the court
The original bill in this case having been framed upon a palpable misapprehension of the position of the parties, and of the
facts connected with and entering into their rights or their obligations, reference to that bill beyond this remark is deemed
unnecessary. The object of the amended bill filed by the complainants on behalf of themselves and others, creditors *of the
mercantile houses of Luke Tiernan and Charles Tiernan of
Baltimore, and of Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co., of New Orleans,
is to procure an appropriation to those creditors of the sum of
$ 15,000, remaining in the hands of the defendant Alexander
Neill, and derived to him from Charles H. Carroll, the trustee
in the deed from Luke Tiernai, filed as an exhibit with the
answer of Neill in this cause. This controversy depends, first,
upon the construction of those clauses of the deed above mentioned, which direct the payment by the trustee to Alexander
Neill, and the application by the latter of the sum so paid, and,
secondly, upon the operation of the rules of law, as controlling
such application in reference to the rights of the separate creditors of Luke Tiernan, and of the joint creditors of the firms of
Luke & Charles Tiernan, and of Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co.
In other words, whether the separate creditors of Luke Tiernan have a prior right of satisfaction from the subject of the
trust constituting the separate private estate of said Tiernan, or
have the right to claim against that separate estate pari passu
only with the several creditors of the mercantile houses of
which Luke Tiernan was a partner. The facts of this case are
few and simple, and are scarcely in any respect controverted;
the cause turns, as has already been remarked, upon the construction of the deed, and upon the rules of equity as applicable
to the position of the grantor, in relation to the different classes
of his creditors, at the period of its execution. The language
of the deed, as indicative of the intention of the grantor, will in
the first place be adverted to. And in considering this language, it may be remarked, that it nowhere speaks of debts
due from Luke Tiernan, as a member of the firms of Luke &
Charles Tiernan, or of Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co., nor mentions
voL. VIII.
36

422

SUPREME COURT.
Murrill et al. v. Neill et al.

nor alludes to those firms, nor to any other mercantile firms
whatsoever. This deed recites the facts of the relinquishment
by Mrs. Tiernan of her dower right in a large amount of property previously sold by her husband, and of her consent to a
similar relinquishment in future sales to be made by the trustee,
Carroll; it recites also a debt due from the grantor to Mrs. Anne
E. Brien, aedeased, which was still unpaid, and was due and
owing to her son, Luke Tiernan Brien. It then proceeds to deThat whereas the said Luke Tiernan is indebted to
clare, -"
divers other persons, residing in different parts of the United
States, in a large sum of money in the aggregate, but the names
of all the persons to whom he is indebted, and the amounts due
to each respectively, the said Luke Tiernan is now unable to
specify particularly. And whereas the said Luke Tiernan is desirous of conveying the laids hereinafter described, in trust that"
the same shall be sold, and the proceeds thereof applied in the
.anner hereinafter particularly specified." The deed then, after directing a sale by the trustee, provides, that he shall remit
from time to time, as the same shall be received, "to Alexander
Neill of Maryland, and payable to his order, of the first moneys
arising from such sales, until he shall have remitted the sum of
$ 15,000, to be paid by the said Alexander Neill to the creditors of-the said Luke Tiernan whose demands shall then have
been ascertained; and if the demands so ascertained shall exceed the said sum of S 15,000, the same shall be applied in part
payment of each of the said demands, in the ratio that each of
said demands shall respectively bear to the whole sum $ 15,000,
so to be applied." The deed then provides, out of further remittances arising from sales to be made by the trustee, for the
payment of $ 12,000 to Mrs. Tiernan, in.compensation"for her
right of dower; and next, for the payment of the debt due to
the son of Mrs. Anne E. Brien, and then declares, that after the
last-mentioned sum (i. e. the sum due to Mrs. Brien or to her
son) shall have been paid, all the moneys arising from such
sales (after deducting expenses, &c.) shall be remitted by the
trustee to th6 said Neill, and the same shall be applied by the
said Neill to the payment of the debts due from the said Luke
Tiernan to all the creditors of the said Luke, whose demands
shall then have been ascertained by the said Alexander Neill;
"and in case that the sum so to be applied shall be insufficient
for the payment of all such demands; then, and in this case,
the same shall be applied in part payment of each of said demands, in the ratio that each of said demands respectively shall
bear to the whole sum to be so applied to that object; and in
case the said sum shall be more than equal to the payment of

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

423

Murrill'et al. v. Neill et al.

such demands, then, and in that case, the residue thereof shall
be paid by the said Alexander Neill to the said Luke Tiernan,
his heirs," &c.
We have already adverted to the circumstance, that the
grantor in this. deed hae nowhere alluded to any mercantile
concern with which he was associated; that he was disposing
of a subject confessedly his own separate property; that he
has not said, that'whereas Luke Tiernan & Son, or Tiernan,
Cuddy, & Co., but that Luke Tiernan, was indebted to Mrs.
Tiernan and to Mrs. Brien, and to divers other persons residing
in different quarters of the country. This would not be the
language of a merchant, (still less of a practised and extensive
merchant,) when intending to designate the firm of which he
makes a part. On such occasions he never mentions himself
.individually, unless he intends expressly to distinguish between himself and his house, and would always be so understood by established mercantile acceptation. And again, if, in
the construction of this deed, the name of Luke Tiernqn is to
be taken as synonymous with Luke Tiernan & Son, and Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co., we should be driven to the conclusionthat
these several firms were indebted to Mrs. Tiernan in consideration of her relinquishment of her dower in her husband's estate, and to Mrs. Brien for the private debt due to her,- for all
these creditors are grouped in the sanfe category. Their claims
originate in the same source, -in
the obligations of Luke
Tiernan. The language of the deed is, that Luke Tiernan
is indebted to Mrs. Tiernan, and to Mrs. Brien; and the same
Luke Tiernan it is who is also indebted to divers other persons
residing in different parts of the United States. Such a construction of the deed involves, we think, a violation of the plain
meaning of the terms of the instrument, and leads to confusion
and absurdity.
It has been insisted for the appellants in this case, that the
admission by the grantor of a large amount of claims against
him, of the diversity of the residence of his creditors, and of
the inability on his part at once to designate those' creditors
and their demands, should be received as proof that the deed
was never intended to be limited to the private creditors of the
grantor, who, it is contended, must, as well as the e~tent of theJr
claims, have been known; but was designed to embrace all
his partnership liabilities. We have just stated that such an
interpretation of the deed is inconsistent with the meaning of
its language. But if we look beyond the deed, to the position
of the parties at the time of its execution, is there any probability arising from that position, which can justify the conclu-

424

SUPREME

COURT.

Murrill et al. v. Neill et al.

sions urged in this respect for the appellants? The grantor in
this deed appears to have been at one time the possessor of
great wealth; the deed made an exhibit in this case shows
that he was the possessor of an unusual extent of property.
It is almost certain, too, from the character and situation of the
subject of this-conveyance, as well as from other circumstances
disclosed by the record, that its owner must have been the proprietor of many other constituents of a large estate, both within and without the city and State of his residence. That a
man thus situated should necessarily be engaged in a variety
of transactions; should employ numerous agents; that many
of his transactions, both as to persons and contracts, should be
conducted by agents; that his knowledge with respect to persons and undertakings should in their detail be dependent on
information to be derived from agents thus employed, - are circumstances, in our view, falling within the range of daily experience, and such as not only may explain the language of an
instrument intended to embrace the transactions of one so situated, but which in fact render such language proper, in order
to bring it within the bounds of experience and truth. The
daily habits of one so situated must imply, to some extent, an
ignorance of the precise detail of all that may be consequent
upon them. We think it natural, (nay, with a due regard to
truth, inevitable,) that one so situated, if called upon on an emergency, should admit his inability to enumerate all that he had
done, - all that he had authorized to be done through others, and every consequence which might flow from the one or the
other. The language of Mr.Tiernan we consider, therefore, as not
more comprehensive than was appropriate to embrace his private
liabilities. The debts due to his wife and to Mrs. Brien were
strictly domestic obligations, necessarily within his knowledge;
were regarded as of a peculiarly sacred character; and therefore
were provided for, exempt from the contingency of an ultimate
insufficiency of funds. But even these claims, however sacred
they may have been deemed, were not permitted absolutely
to precede a contribution at least to other creditors whose condition might be known; but they have been postponed to these
pro tanto. The language of that portion of the deed which,
after the payment directed to be made to Mrs. Tiernan and to
Luke Tiernan Brien, and after distribution of the first fifteen
thousand dollars received from the trustee, directs the application of the subseqlient proceeds of the trust subject to all the
creditors of the grantor then ascertained, and, in the event of
a surplus, the payment of that surplus to the gr ntor, has been
earnestly pressed on our attention. It has been argued upon

this provision of the deed, either that it is expressive of the
inftention of Luke Tiernan to let in all his creditors, social as
well as individual, or that it is fraudulent, as interposing a
hindrance on one or the other class, or on both the classes of
his creditors, by an attempt to retain the proceeds of the land,
in opposition to their rights. We cannot yield to this argument the ends it was designed to accomplish. We think that
the terms of this latter provision, so far from -enlarging the
meaning of the former, so a! to let in upon the trust subject
the creditors of the firms before mentioned, tend rather to
strengthen the limit presented by the former provision when
standing alone. For although the distribution of the money
to be received by Neill is to be made amongst all the creditors, they are still the creditors of the said Luke Tiernan before spoken of, and the creditors of no other person. This
mode of expression, coming from an individual practised in the
habits and language of merchants, we regard as a confirmation
of the intention previously expressed, rather.than as proof of a
departure from that intention. Next, as to any evidence of
fraud resulting from the diredion to pay over to the grantor
in the deed any surplus which might remain after satisfying
the separate creditors; we can perceive no-proof of fraud, no
attempt to hinder or delay the creditors in this direction. Nothing is more probable than that Luke Tiernan might have considered the effects of Luke Tiernan & Son and of Tiernan,
Cuddy, & Co., represented to be of a large amount, as adequate to meet the joint responsibilities of those firms; or, at any
rate, he might have insisted upon his right to refer the partnership creditors to the partnership funds in the first instance, and,
until these should be shown to be insufficient, to retain possession of his separate private estate. The argument then appears to be defective in either aspect in which it is applied.
The second principal position assumad for the appellant is
this; that, conceding the fifteen thousand dollars in controversy
to have been ever so clearly appropriated by Luke Tiernan to
his separate creditors, still, under principles of equity; such an
appropriation cannot be maintained; but that those principles
authorize the partnership creditors of Tiernan & Son, and of
Tiernan, Cuddy, & Co., to charge that fund paripassu with
the separate creditors of said Tiernan.
The rule in equity governing the administration of insolvent
partnerships is one of familiar acceptation and practice; it is
one which will be found to have been in practice in this
country from the beginning of our judicial history, and to
have been generally, if not universally, 'received. This rule,

with one or two eccentric variations in the English practice
which may be noted hereafter, is believed to be identical with
partnership
that prevailing in England, and is this: -That
creditors shall in the first instance be satisfied from the part-nership estate; and separate or private creditors of the individual partners from the separate and private estate of the partners
with whom they have made private and individual contracts;
and that th& private and individual property of the partners
shall not be applied in extinguishment of partnership debts,
until the separate and individual creditors of the respective
partners shall be paid. The reason and foundation of this rule,
or its equality and fairness, the court is not called on to justify.
Were these less obvious than they are, it were enough to show
the early adoption and general prevalence of this rule, to stay
the hand of innovation at this day; at least, under any motive
less strong than the most urgent propriety.
This rule may be traced back in England, with certainty, to
the cases of Ex parte Crowder, in 2 Vernon, 706, (in 1715,)
and of Ex parte Cook, 2 P. Wms. 500, (in 1728,) nearly a century and a half since. It was affirmed by Lord Hardwicke in
Ex parte Hunter, in 1 Atkyns, 228, (in 1742,) and continued
unchanged until the year 1785, when a material innovation
was xiiade upon it by Lord Thurlow, in the case of Ex parte
Hodgson, 2 Bro. Ch. Rep. 5. By the decision last mentioned,
the established practice then of sixty years was so changed, and
the distinction between joint and separate creditors so broken
up, that the former were permitted to come in, and to receive
dividends paripassu with the latter, from the separate estate.
This change led to the practice of filing a bill on behalf of
the separate creditors, to restrain the order in bankruptcy whenever there was a joint estate, and by this means the rights of
the joint and separate creditors on their respective funds were
maintained: a proceeding which could rest on no other foundation, than the peculiar equities of these different parties with
respect to the funds with which they had been respectively
connected. In consequence of the inconvenience of Lord
Thurlow's rule, and of the injustice it was thought to involve,
Lord Loughborough re6stablished the practice that had so long
previously existed, with the single modification of permitting
the joint creditors to prove under a separate commission ; but
denying to them any right to dividends, until after the separate

Thurlow, he says, - 11The difficulty that has struck me upon

it is, that what I order here sitting in 'bankruptcy, I shall forbid to-morrow sitting in chancery ; for it is quite of course to
stop the dividend upon a bill filed. The plain rule of distribution is, that each estate shall bear its own debts. The equity
is so plain, that it is of course upon a bill filed. The object of
the commission is to distribute the effects with the least expense. Every order I make to prove a joint debt on a separate
estate, must produce a bill in equity. It is not fundamentally
a just distribution, nor a convenient distribution.
Every
creditor of the partnership would come upon the separate
estate. The consequence would be, the assignees of the separate estate must file a bill to restrain the dividend upon all
these proofs, and make the partners parties. But there is another circumstance. It is a contrivance to throw this upon the
separate estate." Again his Lordship says, - " It is not stated
as a case where there are no joint funds. Here it is only that
there are two funds. Their proper fund is the joint estate, and
they must get all they can from that first. I have no difficulty
in ordering them to be permitted to prove; but not to receive a
dividend." This doctrine of Lord Loughborough, deduced, as
he tells us, not less from fundamental principles of equity, than
from convenience in the administration of bankrupts' estates,
appears to have been followed in England ever since. The
numerous cases chiefly before Lord Eldon going to sustain this
position, would, if quoted, unnecessarily encumber our opinion;
they are collected in note 1 to the case of Elton ex parte, 3
Vesey by Sumner, p. 242. It may be proper in this place to
mention the two departures permitted by the Court of Chancery in England from the general rule pursued by that court,
which departures were adverted to in a previous part of this
opifiion. The first is presented in the instance in which the
petitioning creditor, though a joint creditor, is permitted to
charge the separate effects paripassu with the separate creditors, because, as it is said, his petition, being prior in time, is in
the nature of an execution in behalf of himself and the separate
creditors.
The second is that in which there are no joint
effects at all. In this last instance it is said that the joint
creditors may come in for dividends paripassu on the separate
effects; though if there be joint effects, though of the smallest
possible amount, this priviledge would not be allowed. These
exceptions it seems difficult to reconcile with the reason or
equity on which the general rule is founded; they are-but exceptions, however, and cannot impair that rule. They do not,
for aught we have seen, appear to have been recognized by the
courts of this country. The case of Tucker v. Oxley, 5

428

COURT.

Murrill et al. v. Neill et aL

Cranch,- 34, was a case at law, and the court in that case,
whilst they admitted the joint creditors to prove and to receive
dividends against the separate estate, explicitly recognized the
authority of Ex parte Elton, and the power and the duty of a
court of chancery, upon application thereto, to prevent the
diversion of the separate fund. The latter exception above referred to was considered by the Court of Appeals of Maryland,
in the case of McCulloh v. Dashiell, 1 Harris and Gill's
Reports, 97, and by that court expressly repudiated.
The doctrine upon this question of distribution, as illustrated
both in the English and American decisions, will be found to
be ably treated in the case of Murray v. Murray, 5 Johnson's
Chancery Reports, 72 et seq.; and by Archer, Justice, in the
case of McCulloh v. Dashiell, in 1 Harris and Gill, pp. 99 to
107; and the authorities, both English and American, are collated in a learned note in the third volume of Kent's Commentaries, beginning onp. 65 of that volume.
The proper conclusion from these authorities we deem to be
this, as is stated also by Justice Story in his treatise on Partnership, p. 376, where he says, - " It is a general rule, that
the joint debts are primarily payable out of the joint effects,
and are entitled to a preference over separate debts of the
bankrupt; and so, in the converse case, the separate debts are
primarily payable out of the separate effects, and possess a like
preference; and the surplus, only after satisfying such priorities,
can be reached by the other class of creditors."
Upon a full consideration of this cause, we are of the opinion
that, upon either ground of objection urged to the decree of the
Circuit Court, that decree should be affirmed, and it is hereby
accordingly affirmed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District
of Maryland, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by
this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this
cause be, and the same is hereby, affirmed, with costs.
