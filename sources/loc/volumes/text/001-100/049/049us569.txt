In the year 1819, the Legislature of Illinois authorized Samuel Wiggins, his heirs
and assigns, to establish a ferry on the east bank of the River Mississippi, near
the town of Illinois, and to run the same from lands "that may belong to him,"
provided the ferry should be put into actual operation within eighteen months.
At this time he had no land, but within the eighteen months acquired an interest in
a tract of one hundred acres.
In 1821, another act was passed, authorizing him to remove the ferry "on any land
that may belong to him" on the said Mississippi River, under the same privileges
as were prescribed by the former act.
The words of this act, "on any land that may belong to him:' must be construed to
apply to the land which then belonged to hiin, and not to such as he obtained after
the passage of the act, viz. in 1822.
The following rules for construing statutes applied to the case, viz.: First, - That in a grant, designed by the sovereign power making it to be a general
benefit and Accommodation to the public, if the meaning of the words be doubtful,
they shall be taken most strongly against the grantee and for the government i
and therefore should not be extended by implication in favor of the grantee beyond the natural and obvious meaning of the words employed; and if these do
not support the right claimed, it must fall.
Secondly, -' If the grant admits of two interpretations, one of which is more extended, and the other more restricttd, so that a choice is fairly open, and either
may be adopted without any apparent violation of the apparent objects of the
grant, if in such case one interpretation would render the grant inoperative and
the other would give it force and effect, the latter, if within a reasonable construetion of the teris employed, should be adopted.
The jurisdiction of this court, under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, extends to a review of the judgment of a State court, where the point involved was
the alleged violation of a contract granting a ferry right by a State to an individual,
but it does not extend to a case where the alleged violation of a contract is, that a
State has taken more land than was necessary for the easement which it wanted,
and thus violatd the contract under which the owner held his land by a patent.
It rests with State legislatures and State courts exclusively to protect their citizens from injustice and oppression of this description.

Tnis case was brought up from the Supreme Court of the
State of Illinois, by a writ of error issued under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act.

Mills and others filed their bill in chancery in the Statp court
of Illinois, seeking to obtain an injunction against the defend-

ants in error. The bill states the case of the complainants as
follows.
The people of the western part of Illinois had, -from the earliest settlement of that country, maintained a constant commercial intercourse with the town of St. Louis, and long felt the
necessity for increased facilities in crossing the Mississippi
River. For the purpose of securing these facilities, the State
made a contract with Samuel Wiggins for the establishment
of a ferry across that stream, with boats to be propelled by
steam or horse power. An act of the General Assembly was
passed, which was approved on the 2d of March, 1819, which
was as follows: "An Act to authorize Samuel Wiggins to establish a Ferry upon the Waters of the Mississippi. Approved March 2, 1819.
â€¢SEC. 1. Be it enacted by the pebple of the -State of Illinois,
represented in the General Assembly, that Samuel Wiggins, his
heirs and assigns, be, and they are hereby, authorized to establish a ferry on the waters of the Mississippi, near the town of
Illinois in this State, and to run the same from lands at the
said place tha t may belong to him. Provided, that he shall not
use any boat or water-craft, except such as shall be propelled or
urged to the water by steam, horses, oxen, or other four-footed
animals. Provided, that the said Samuel Wiggins, his heirs
and assigns, shall have the said ferry in actual operation within
eighteen months from and after the passage or this act.
"SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, that no person or persons, except those who have ferries now established at this
place,. shall establish any ferry of the description aforesaid
within one mile of 'the ferry established under this act. And
if any person or persons shall, contrary to the provisions -of
this act, run any boat or boats of the description aforesaid, he,
she, -or .they shall forfeit, every such boat, with its furniture
and apparel, to the said' Samuiel Wiggins,. his heirs and assigns,
which may be attached and recovered before any-court in this
State having competent jurisdiction.
"SEC. 3. And be it 'further enacted, that it- shall and may
be lawful for the said Samuel Wiggins, his heirs or assigns,
to demand and receive the same rates of ferriage as are, now
of right demandable at the ferry established nearest to the
ferry authorized to be established by this act. Provided, that
no more shall be charged for a wagon, cart, or other carriage,
if loaded, than could be charged if empty.
11SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, that the ferry hereby established shall be subject 4o.the same taxes as are now, or here-

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

571

Mills et aL v. St. Clair County et al.

after may be, imposed on other ferries within this State, and
under the same regulations and forfeitures. And that if the
provisions of the second section of this act 'shall be made to
appear to the General Assembly to be injurious to the public
good, that then, and in such case, the said second section may
be repealed."
At the date of this act, Wiggins did not own any land near
the town of Illinois; but within the time allowed by the act
for the establishment of the ferry, he purchased a tract of land:
of one hundred acres, and established the ferry, with boats
propelled by horses, according to the terms of the act.
He increased the means of transportation as the public wants
required, and changed the boats employed from boats propelled
by horses to boats propelled by steam, so as to comply with
the letter and spirit of his contract with the State of Illinois,
and meet all the demands of the increasing population and
commerce.
The bill claims, that under this act of the 2d of March,
1819, Samuel Wiggins, his heirs and assigns, were entitled to
the perpetual franchise of maintaining a ferry across the Mississippi from any point near the town of Illinois, upon any
land that might at any time belong to him or them.
The bill states that the bank of the Mississippi, opposite the
town of St. Louis, is an alluvial formation, which is continually
falling into the stream, and that the character of the stream is
such that, by reason of the frequent changes in the channel, the
sudden formation of sand-bars, and the falling of the banks, it
became necessary for Wiggins, in order to fulfil his contract
with the State of Illinois, to acquire title to a large space of
land on the bank of the river, in order to change the place of
landing as the changes in the river and in its banks might
require.
The Legislature of Illinois, appreciating this necessity, and
recognizing the franchise as perpetual, passed an act on the 6th
day of February, 1821, the essential parts of which were as
follows: -

"An Act to authorize Samuel- Wiggins to make a Turnpike
Road, and for other Purposes. Approved February 6, 1821.
"SEC. 1. Be it enacted, by the people of the State of Illinois, represented in the General Assembly, that Samuel Wiggins, his heirs or assigns, be, and hereby are, authorized to
make and construct a turnpike road, of one hundred feet wide,
to commence on the Mississippi River, opposite to St. Louis,

572

SUPREME COURT.
Mills et' al. v. St. Clair County et al.

on lands that may.belong to him, to run thence across the
American Bottom to the bluffs -within two miles of George
Swaggart's, and to construct and erect all necessary bridges
on said roadf and that he or they-be, and are hereby, authorized-to build and make said turnpike road through the lands of
any person or persons whomsoever, except yards, gardens, orchards, or dwelling-houses; that, when the aforesaid road is
about to be carried through any improved land, the maker of
said road shall first o'btain the consent of the proprietor or
proprietors of said grounds, and should the parties not agree on
the amount of said damages, then a jury of six reputable freeholders should be summoned, and being duly sworn before any
justice of the peace of the county faithfully and impartially to
assess the damages, which damages shall be paid before the
said road shall be permitted to pass through such grounds."
"And wlrereas the said Samuel Wiggins, his heirs and assigns, were authorized to establish a ferry upon the waters of
the Mississippi River, near the town of Illinois, in this State,
and a sand-bar having been formed since that time opposite
said ferry, therefore :"S Ec. 5. Be it further enacted, that the said Samuel Wiggins, his heirs and assigns, be, and they are hereby, authorized
to remove said-ferry on any land that may belong to him or
them on the said Mississippi River, under the same privileges
as Were prescribed by the act entitled, IAn act to authorize
Samuel Wiggins to esiablish a ferry upon the, waters of the
Mississippi;' approved March 2d, 1819."
Oh the 13th of July, 1822, Wiggins acquired title to a tract of
four hundred 'acres of'land, adjoining the tract from which he
first ran his ferry' The tract so acquired is situated on the
*bank of the river below his first tract, and was necessary to
the owners of the ferry franchise in order to secure a convenient landing of the boats, as changes occurred in the channel
or in the bank of the river.
.
The bill states .sudry conveyances and descents, byi which
the complainants have become invested with the title to all the
land held by said Wiggins, and with the franchise granted by
the State of Illinois.
It is also averred that Wiggins, while the owner of the franchise, fulfilled all the duties a~d obligations which he had assumed under his contract with the State of Illinois, and that
his assignees, owners of said franchise, have ever since his
transfer of the franchise in like manner fully discharged those
duties; that speedy, secure, and comfortable passage has been

573

Mills et al. v St Clair County et al.

at all times afforded for all persons and property offered to be
crossed over the river, in such vessels only as are required by
the act granting the franchise.
The bill then states an act of the Legislature of the State
of Illinois, approved on the 2d of March, 1839, by which commissioners were appointed to locate a road and ferry-landing
between Cahokia Creek and the Mississippi River, opposite St.
Louis; the road and ferry-landing to be three hundred feet
wide, upon the most eligible ground for the purpose. This act
authorized the County Commissioners' Court of St. Clair County
to cause the land on which the road and ferry-landing should
be located to be condemned, and pay the owners of the land
the damages; and after such payment the 'said court should
have power to enter upon the land so condemned, and establish
a ferry across the Mississippi River, and might either carry on
the ferry for the county itself, or lease it for any term not exceeding five years, to any lessees.
The commissioners thus appointed located the road and ferrylanding, three hundred feet wide, upon the land which Wiggins acquired in July, 1822, and which was conveyed by him
with the franchise.
The land was condemned, and its value estimated at six
hundred dollars, being less than the annual ground rent which
it would produce without any connection with any ferry privilege.
In estimating the damages to be paid, the jury were expressly directed 'to confine their estimate of the damages to the
value of the land. itself, and not to consider any interference
with the ferry frnchise of the complainants as a subject of compensation.
The bill states that the county of St. Clair, through its
agents, entered upon and took in possession the said lands so
condemned, and has leased the same, together with the ferry
authorized by the said act of 1839, to James Harrison, at a
yearly rent of $ 800; and that a ferry has been established
from said land to the city of St. Louis. The rates of ferriage
charged by said Harrison are fixed in his lease, exhibited with
the bill, as exhibit S. No. 18.
The complainants aver that the land so taken from them is a
part of their ferry-landing, as authorized by the two acts of the
Legislature under which they claim, and that the land so taken
is indispensable to the exercise of the franchise with which
they are invested. From time to time they have been compelled to change their place of landing, as the changes.in the
river, and its banks and sand-bars, required, so that the whole

COURT.

Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

front on the river has been necessary to the enjoyment of their
franchise and the performance of their duty, and that the said
land so taken from them is not only the most convenient point
on their land for their ferry-landing, but is the only point where
boats can securely be landed without running far up the
stream, so as to make their trip about twelve- hundred yards
longer than if they still owned and could use the land so taken
from them.
The complainants allege that the act of the Legislature of
Illinois of March 2, 1839, authorizing the taking of a part of
their ferry-landing, is a violation of the first clause of the tenth
section of the first article of the Constitution of the United
States, which prohibits the States from passing laws impairing
the obligation of contracts.
The bill prays for an injunction to restrain the defendants
from maintaining a ferry from the land so taken from the complainants.
I w
To this bill there was a demurrer, which was sustained by
the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, and the bill dismissed.
An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, and the decree of
the Circuit Court affirmed.
From this decree of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, a writ of error brought the case up to this court.
It was argued by Mr. Gamble and Mr. Webster, for the
plaintiffs in error, and Mr. Breeze, for the defendants.
Mr. Gamble made the following points, which he sustained
orally. (Mr. Breeze and-Mr. Webster both presented written
arguments, of which the Reporter can only give extracts.)
1. The franchise which the complainants hold by purchase
from Wiggins, extended to the land which has been taken from
them under the act of the Legislature of Illinois of 2d March,
1839.
2. The land so taken is necessary to the enjoyment of the
franchise.a
3. No compensation has been made to the complainants, nor
is any authorized to be made, for the violation of the franchise.
4. The act of the Illinois Legislature complained of is a violation of the Constitution of the United States, under the earlier
decisions of this court.. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87; Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Peters, 514; New Jersey v. Wilson,
7 Cranch, 164; Dartmouth College case, 4 Wheat. 518.
5. The act complained of is not constitutional, within the
scope of the later decisions in the Charles River Bridge case, 11
Peters, 549; and West River Bridge case, 6 Howard, 507.

JANUARY- TERM, 1850.

575

Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

Mr. Breeze first contended, that this case did not fall within
the jurisdiction of the court, because the Supreme Court of Illinois rested its decision upon the construction of the act of the
Legislature, and the extent of the ferry franchise acquired under it; limiting it to the land owned by Wiggins wheo the act
of 1821 was pasied, with the exercise of which franchise the
law complained of did not interfere.
2. That the grant to Wiggins was of no validity, because the
Legislature had no power to make grants of privileges to be exercised beyond its territorial limits and over a navigable stream,
declared by law to be a public highway.
3. That the laws in question were not contracts, within the
meaning of the prohibition of the Constitution of the United
States. That private contracts alone were contemplated in this
provision of the Constitution.
4. That these laws in themselves had none of the features
of contracts, for the want of mutuality, &c.
5. Admitting, however, for the sake of the argument only,
that these laws are contracts, then the appellees insist that the
Legislature of Illinois has, in no degree, impaired their obligation, by any other act in favor of other parties subsequently
passed, and certainly not by the act of March 2, 1839, about
which this controversy has arisen. The appellants, to sustain
their complaint, assume the ground, that, by the act of 1819,
the authority to Wiggins to establish a ferry was perpetual and
exclusive, and that having become the proprietor of ther lands
at a great distance from the tract he pretended to own in 1819,
the Legislature authorized him, by the act of 6th February,
1821, to remove his ferry to them, and thereby, as his assigns,
the appellants, contend, have necessarily, excluded all other ferries between them, making theirs a movable one, covering a
distance of a mile or more up and down the river, and authorizing them to shift it from point to point, as their views of expediency might suggest.
The appellees contend, that the appellants have not, as the
assigns of Wiggins, any exclusive right to a ferry franchise by
the act of 1819, and that their ferry is not of that ambulatory
character they insist it has been made by the act of 1821.
The court understands, that, when the act of 1819 was passed,
Wiggins owned no land on the river near the town of Illinois;
that it was not until a year or more thereafter that he obtained
title to an undivided two sevenths of a tract of one hundred
acres, of the heirs of one Piggot, and known as claim 624.
Upon this tract he located his ferry, at a certain known and
fixed point. It will be further understood by the plat of sur-

576

SUPREME COURT.
Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

vey before the court, that the town of Illinois is not on the river, but on the east bank of Cahokia Creek, and some hundred
yards from the river, and from it to the river there never was a
public Toad until after the passage of the act of 1839, under
which appellees claim. The grantor of appellants, owning the
land b=tween the creek and the river, and the whole of the river-bank, could, and did up to that time, prevent all competition
with him and his assigns and keep off all rivals; and for a similar purpose he enlarged his possessions on the bank of the river
by the purchase of land from Jarrot and others, in 1822, known
as claim 579, on which the appellees established their ferry, at
the termination of a public road, regularly laid out, three hundred feet wide, from the bridge over Cahokia Creek to the river,
and through the land of the appellants, after the same was regularly condemned in pursuance of the laws of the State of Illinois, and compensation tendered. To this last-ilamed tract, appellants' ferry was removed under the authority supposed to be
granted by the act of 1821, although Wiggins did not, at the
passage of that act, own it. - To whatever point, then, on this
tract, it was removed, the appellees insist, that point became
the ferry-landing, and there appellants' privileges were to be
exercised, and not elsewhere. It could not thereafter be removed to the first location without the consent of the Legislature, nor to any other point on the tract. A ferry must, from
the nature of such" establishments, be kept stationary at one
point, until legislative sanction can be had to remove it to
another; and so Wiggins thought when he applied to the Legislature to remove it from claim 624 to claim 579. And this
from motives of public convenience. It would be a great injury to the public to permif the owner of such a franchise, at his
discretion, and to suit his whim or caprice, to move it from
point to point. When a point was selected, that became the
"ferry," and there and there only, and from it, could the privilege be exercised. The right of way over the water could not,
by any reasonable construction, extend over every particle of
space covered by miles of distance. A reasonable space for
landings and ferry-ways is all that could be claimed. The excuse put forth by appellants, for shifting their landing,- the
character of the current and the texture of the banks, - is all
idle, as every one knows who has ever seen the bank of the
Mississippi opposite St. Louis. A landing can be made at one
point as well as at another, if proper means are used for grading
the banks, and proper platforms provided. The object and design for shifting the landing was undoubtedly to keep off rivals,
-to prevent competition, and thus enable, for all time to come,
the appellants to divide their fifty thousand dollars a year.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

577

Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

The ferry being established, by the act of 1819, on the Piggot tract (claim 624), within eighteen months after its passage,
Wiggins had the right, so far as the Legislature could confer it,
to all the advantages which might result from it, and to all the
provisions of the act, and nothing more.
Did, then, the Legislature, by that act, intend that h.. privilege should be exclusive for ever, and is that intention manifest
from the terms used in the act?
The first section contains the grant, if it be one, and is, in
substance, as follows: - That Samuel Wiggins, his heirs or
assigns, are authorized to establish a ferry on the waters of the
Mississippi, near the town of Illinois, in this State, and to run
the same from lands at the said place that may belong to him,
with a provision that he shall use steam or the power of fourfooted animals, and provided, that the same shall be in operation within eighteen months, &c.
The second section provides, that no person or persons, except those who had ferries then established at that place, should
establish any ferry of that description within one mile of it, and
if it is done, a forfeiture to Wiggins of the boats, furniture, and
apparel shall be the consequence.
The third section authorizes Wiggins to receive the accustomed rates of ferriage, and the fourth and last section subjects
it to taxes, and then declares, "If the provisions of the second
section shall be made to appear to the General Assembly to be
injurious to the public good, that then, and in such case, the
said section may be repealed."
The appellants contend, that the grant would be .perfect
without the second section. So it would; but when arraigning an act of the Legislature of a sovereign State as repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States, because it repealed a
former act of that body, we must examine and see what the
first act is, -we must take the whole of it together, to ascertain
the intention of the law-maker; and we see in this act of 1819
a right reserved to the State to repeal that part of it which bestows the character of exclusiveness upon the appellants' privilege. The Legislature of 1819 acted upon circumstances as
they then were, and foreseeing that, from the great advantages
the State possessed, in soil, climate, and power of production,
and its great capacity for settlement and cultivation, people from
distant lands would seek it for a home, reserved the right to
take away a privilege, which, when granted, might be of great
public benefit, but likely to become in time oppressive.
With commendable forecast, the fourth section was inserted,
and became an important part of the so-called contract, and the
VOL. VI1.

49

578

SUPREME COURT.
Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

act of 1821 was passed, with the same power to repeal included.
The acts were accepfed, with that power reserved. In 1833,
(Rev. Laws, 310, 311,) the Legislature determined that section
was injurious to the public good, as well as the fifth section -of
the act of 1821. Fourteen years' experience had satisfied them,
that what was intended for the public benefit had become an
oppressive monopoly, and they performed a most popular act
by repealing them,.thus taking away all pretext of exclusiveness, and opening the whole subject to further legislation.
This was "nominated in the bond," and the appellants cannot
with any propriety or justice complain, if it is injurious to them.
The Legislature, then, having; by the act of 1833, (Rev. Laws
of 1833, p. 310,) repealed the restrictive clause of the second
section of the act of 1819, and of the fifth section of the act of
1821, proceeded in 1839, in obedience to public clamor, excited
to a high tone by the* continued and oppressive exactions of
this monopoly, and its repeated failures, and manifest inability
or want of desire to satisfy the public demands for proper facilities for crossing the river, to put measures in train to satisfy
the public want. The preamble to the act of 2d March, 1839,
assigns the reason for its passage,- the facts upon which th&
Legislature acted, -and they must be taken to be true. It is a
legislative decision, that the exigency had arisen, which, on the
repeal of the second section of the act of 1819, required increased facilities of approach to a place then grown to be a
great commercial city, and the great market of the State.
By examining the provisiofis of that act, it will be seen that
in no part of it is an expression used of a design to take from
the appellants their franchise; theirs still exists in all its vigor,
precisely as it did before the passage of. the act. No interference with their ferry-ways is contemplated or attempted; no
part or portion .of their right, as secured by the act of 1819 or
1821, is taken from them or abridged. Although the receipt
of tolls may be lessened by this rival ferry, yet the right itself
is as perfect as ever. It is still lawful for them to receive all
the tolls that may come to their ferry. Should the rival ferry
sd successfully compete with them, as finally to take from them
all the travel, still -their rights, conferred by the act of 1819 and
1821, yet inure to them. (Charles River Bridge v. Warren
Bridge, 11 Peters, 420.
The appellees perceive no distinction between the rights of
pontage and of ferriage, and if it was lawful, as it was unquestionably, to establish the Warren Bridge, by which all the tolls
were taken from the Charles River Bridge, previously established
by an act of the Legislature of Massachusetts, it is not perceiv-

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

579

Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

ed why the same results should not rightfully flow in this case,
the more especially as the Legislature had reserved the right, inthe very act which gave the authority, to destroy the character
of exclusiveness for which the appellants contend. Legislation
affects every day the value of property, and it must be so in the
nature of things. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Peters, 514.
If the act of 1839 designed to seize the ferry-ways of the
appellants, there would be ground of complaint; but it does
not. It designs only to establish a healthy and necessary competition, at a very important point, by which the public good is
vastly promoted, and the land taken for such a beneficial public purpose, for a road and landing, has been condemned in the
usual mode, the damages assessed, aud-a tender of the amount
made to appellants. .
Whether the road is too wide or not is not for this court to
determine; it is only to determine whether, in the adjudication of the rights of these parties by a State court, validity has
been given to a law of the State impairing the obligation of
any contract entered into between the State and the appellants,
and doing, by such decision, injustice to them. The appellees can see no ground for such a pretence, and without
taking up more time, they submit the case on their part to the
court, confideht that this most just and enlightened tribunal
will not condemn a law of a sovereign State, unless that, law is
manifestly repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. Webster replied to each one of these points, and particularly the last, citing and commenting upon many parts of the'
bill, which were all admitted by the demurrer, in order to show
that the act of 1839 had destroyed the value of the ferry privilege.
Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
By an act of March 2d, 1839, the Legislature of Illinois appointed five commissioners to locate a road and ferry-landing,
three hundred feet wide, on the east bank of 'the River Mississippi, opposite to the city of St. Louis; the road to extend back
to Cahokia Creek. The road and landing were accordingly located; the distance from the river to the creek b( iag about sixty
poles. The ferry having gone into operation under the act of
1839, this bill was filed, seeking to obtain a perpetual injunction against an exercise of a ferry privilege, on the ground,
-among others, that Samuel Wiggins and his assignees were entitled to the exclusive ferry right at that place, by contract with
the State of Illinois; and that said contract was violated by

SUPREME COURT.
Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

the act of 1839, and the establishment of a road and ferry
under and by force of its provisions. The Supreme Court of
Illinois having decided that the State law, and the acts done
pursuant thereto, did not violate the contract made with Wiggins, and that it was not opposed to the Constitution of the
United States, that court proceeded, by a final decree, to dissolve an injunction granted nisi, and to dismiss the bill. To
reverse this decree, on the grounds stated, a writ of error has
been prosecuted to the Supreme Court of Illinois, from this court,
under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789.
The contract relied on by the defendants was made with
Wiggins, by two acts of the Legislature of Illinois. The first
act, approved March 2d, 1819, authorizes Samuel Wiggins, his
heirs and assigns, to establish a ferry on the east bank of the
River Mississippi, near the town of Illinois, and to run the same
from lands "that may belong to him"; provided that said ferry
should be put into actual operation within eighteen months
from and after the passage of that act. And it was also provided by the second section, that no other person should thereafter establish any ferry within one mile of that established by
Wiggins, with this reservation: - " That if the provisions of the
second section of this act shall be made to appear to the General Assembly to be injurious to the public good, that then, and
in such case, the second section may be repealed." Wiggins had
no land of his own on the river near the town of Illinois when
the above act was passed; but within less than eighteen
months, he acquired an interest in a tract of land of one hundred acres, part of which lay between Illinois town and the
river, and extended to a considerable distance above it; and on
this tract he established his ferry.
On the 6th of February, 1821, Samuel Wiggins had another
act passed in his favor by the Legislature of Illinois, authorizing him to make a turnpike road, to commence on the Mississippi River opposite to St. Louis, on lands that "may belong to
him," and to run across the American bottom to the bluffs.
The act further provides: -

" And whereas the said Samuel

Wiggins, his heirs and assigns, were authorized to establish a
ferry upon the waters of the Mississippi River, near the town
of Illinois, in this State, and a sand-bar having been formed
since that time opposite said ferry, therefore: " SEc. 5. Be it further enacted, that the said Samuel Wiggins, his heirs and assigns, be, and they are hereby, authorized to
remove said ferry. on any land that may belong to him or them
on the said Mississippi River, under the same privileges as were
prescribed by the act entitled, 'An act to authorize Samuel

Wiggins to establish a ferry upon the waters of the Mississippi,'
approved March 2d, 1819."
By an act approved January 19th, 1833, so much of the acts
of 1819 and 1821 as prohibited another ferry from being established within one mile of Wiggins's ferry-landing, was repealed.
This restriction is, therefore, out of the case.
On the 13th of July, 1822, Wiggins obtained, by purchase
from Julia Jarrot, a tract of one hundred acres, lying below the
tract first acquired, adjoining thereto on the south, and fronting
on the river; and it is upon this tract that the new ferry and
.road were located under the act of 1839. The parties respectively assume, and so the court below held, that the establishment and regulation of ferries across navigable streams is a subject within the control of the government, and not matter
of private right; and that the governinent may exercise its
powers by contracting with individuals. We deem this general
principle not open to controversy; and in regard to so much of
the controversy as involves the contract itself, no material difficulty exists as to what principles of law shall govern: only two
general principles need be invoked in construing the acts of
1819 and 1821, which are, -First, that in a grant, like this,
designed by the sovereign power making it to be a general
benefit and accommodation to the public, the rule is, that, if the
meaning of the words be doubtful, they shall be taken most
strongly against the grantee, and for the government; and
therefore should not be extended by implication in Tavor of the
grantee, beyond the natural and obvious meaning of the words
employed; and if these do not support the right claimed, it
must fall. Such is the established doctrine of this court, as
was held in the case of The Charles Riv.er Bridge v. The Warren Bridge, 11 Peters, 544-547.
Secondly, if the grant admits of two interpretations, one of which is more extended, and
the other more restricted, so that a choice is fairly open, and
either may be adopted without any violation of the apparent
objects of the grant, if, in such case, one interpretation would
render the grant inoperative, and the other would give it force
and effect, the latter, if within a reasonable construction of the
terms employed, should be adopted.
Testing the contract by these rules, and what are the complainants entitled to, under the acts of 1819 and 1821? By the
first act, Wiggins was to establish the ferry near the town of
Illinois, "and to run the same from lands at said place which
may belong to him." At the time the act was passed, Wiggins owned no land near the town of Illinois, and If the
grant was in the present tense, and extended only to land

that was then the property of the grantee, the act of Assembly
had no operation, and was worthless. But we suppose the
words employed were not restrictcd to the time when the act
was passed; the grantee was allowed eighteen months to put
the ferry into operation., and he was to run his boats from his
own lands, that is, from lands which might belong to him at
the time the running commenced; and for this there was great
reason, as the opposite shore lay within another State, aid
there, also, a ferry-landing had to be secured. The matter was
one of speculation; and lands could not, with propriety, be
purchased at high prices before the privilege was secured on
both banks. And this construction, as we apprehend, is the
one that the Legislature of Illinois put on the act of 1819 by
that of 1821; by which it was admitted that a ferry had been
established aceording to the first act, and the grantee was
authorized to remove it to another point, because a sand-bar had
been formed in front of the landing: We therefore feel ourselves constrained to differ from the carefully prepared and able
opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois, found in the record,
which holds the first grant to have been inoperative.
We come next to consider the act of 1821. When it was
passed, Wiggins had land fronting on the river for nearly a
mile, extending both above and below Illinois town, and lying
between it and the river. It was all the land he then could
desire for the purposes of his ferry and the end of his road. Indeed, it is doubtful whether, under the grant, Wiggins could
have gone below his first purchased tract and been "near the
toxvn of Illinois," becaus6 his land extended considerably below
the town. As the act of 1821 recognized the fact that Wiggins
had complied with his contract under the act of 1819, and had
established a ferry on land that belonged to him, and that it
was established "near the town of Illinois," it is fair to presume
that both parties to the contract, as modified and enlarged by
the act of 1821, understood what land it was that Wiggins
owned at that time, and the boundaries thereof; and also the
extent of his interest, being two sevenths of the tract.
The act of 1821 was treated by the bill, and was relied on in
argument, as conferring a perpetual privilege on Wiggins, and
on his assigns, to remove the ferry to any land that might belong to him, or to them, at the time of the removal; and, furthermore, that the right of removal was unrestricted as respects
time, and could have been made at any time heretofore, or
could be made hereafter.
That the act is somewhat obscure, in regard to the place to
which the ferry could be removed, must be admitted; and in7

Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

seekirig its true construction, several considerations present
themselves. In the first place, that the act operated in the
present tense, and was a mere enlargement of the privileges
conferred by the act of 1819, and must be taken as a part of
the first contract, cannot be denied; secondly, when we take
into consideration the fact that Wiggins had a specific tract of
land at that time, at the proper place,- that is to say, lying in
front of Illinois town, and extending above and below it, -a
reasonable conclusion is, that some place on such tract was referred to by the act of 1821 ; and, thirdly, as the act of 1819
reserved authority in the Legislature to repeal so much of the
law as secured to Wiggins an exclusive ferry right for two
miles on the river front, such reservation could only mean that
rival ferries might be established, at discretion, by the Legislature. Nor can it be assumed, with any claim to a plausible
construction, that the power of removal had no limitation of
time or place, as this would confer a right to remove to the
same landing with a newly established ferry, set up as a rival,
and drive it away; and thus the public convenience would
again be reduced to a single ferry. Now, in view of these
facts and consequences, and applying them to language of an
ambiguous character, and seeking assistance from a settled rule
of construction in case of doubt, and finding that rule of construction -to be, that when two constructiong are equally open
to the court, the one shall be adopted most favorable to the
government, the consequence must be, on this construction,
that Wiggins was confined to the tract of land partly owned by
him when the act of 1821 was passed; and that when the
ferry was removed to other land, lower down the river, it was
an act not within the contract, nor protected by it. This disposes of the first and principal ground of relief sought by the
bill.
Whether Wiggins- or those claiming under him, had the
right after he had established his new ferry, under the act of
1821, to remove it to another place on the tract of land he then
owned, and whether the State of Illinois may not authorize
another ferry on the same tract of land, not interfering with the
operations of the one established by Wiggins, are questions
which the record does not bring before us, and upon which,
therefore, we express no opinion.
A second ground of relief is relied on by the bill, and was
most earnestly and ably urged in argument here, and which it
is incumbent on us to dispose of also.
The first special prayer would seem to conclude an inquiry
into any ground of interference by this court, other than the

SUPREME COURT.
Mills et al. v. St. Clair County et al.

question arising on the acts of 1819 and 1821, standing as a
contract, claimed to have been violated by the act of 1839.
But the bill has also a general prayer; and on this, as well as
upon the special prayer, the Supreme Court of Illinois ordered,
"that it be certified in this case, that there was drawn in question the validity of the statute of the State of Illinois entitled,
'An act to authorize St. Clair county to establish a ferry across
the Mississippi River,' approved March 2, 1839, on the ground
that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States,
and that the decision of the court was in favor of the validity
of said statute" ; from which certificate it is manifest that the
act of 1839 was upheld against each state of facts set forth by
the bill; and if it was apparently repugnant to the Constitution
on either ground assumed, this court has jurisdiction of the
cause; and having jurisdiction, the plaintiffs in error were entitled to be heard. and are entitled to our judgment, on both
grounds presented, and relied on to reverse.
The bill sets forth that gross abuses were imposed on complainants by the act of 1839, and by the commissioners and
their lessee, under the act; that the said three hundred feet include a wider space, and more laud, than is necessary or convenient for a road, and but a small portion of it has been used
and appropriated by the said county of St. Clair to that purpose, leaving a strip on either side to be used by the said
county of St. Clair and its lessees, for private property, for
building lots, and other private purposes; and that that portion
of the said three hundred feet which is not included in said
road, and which is now used for private purposes, or is left to
be thus used, will yield an annual ground rent larger than the
whole amount of the damages assessed as aforesaid for the
whole of said three hundred feet; and furthermore, that only
the condemned land was valued, and no compensation awarded
or tendered for the ferry franchise and landing taken from complainants.
As the bill was demurred to, and the demurrer sustained in
the State courts, aid'in this form the case comes before us, all
charges of abuse and oppression on the part of the authorities
of Illinois are admitted, to the extent alleged; and the question
presented here on these facts is, whether this court has power
to redress'the-injuries complained of, under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789.
The Constitution having declared that no State shall pass any
law impairing the obligation of contracts, it becomes our duty
to inquire whether, the State law, and the acts done under it,
violate a contract. .If. any contract was violated under the

act of 1839, it must have been a grant to land vesting the fee
simple title; and such title complainants exhibit. To the
width of needful roads and ferry-landings, property can undoubtedly be taken, for the purposes of such easements; and
necessarily, the State authorities must decide, (as a general
rule,) how much land the public convenience requires. That
the power may be abused, no one can deny; and that it is
abused, when private property is taken, not for public use, but
to be leased out to private occupants to the end of raising
money, is too plain for reasoning to make it more so. Such
an act is mere evasion, under pretence of an authorized exercise of the eminent domain; and if it be an evasion, it is void,
and may be redressed by an action at law, like any other illegal
trespass, done under assumed authority; as, for instance, a trespass by a younger grantee on land held by an elder patent depending for support on a State law of later date than the first
grant. But it is not an invasion and illegal seizure of private
property on pretence of exercising the right of eminent domain, and which act is an abuse claiming the sanction of a
State law, that gives this court jurisdiction; such law, and the
acts done under it, are not, "the violation of a contract," in
the sense and meaning of the Constitution. it rests with State
legislatures and State courts to protect their citizens from injustice and oppression of this description. The framers of the
Constitution never intended that the legislative and judicial
powers of the general government should extend to munidpal
regulations necessary to the well-being and existence of the
States. Were this court to assume jurisdiction, and re6xamine
and revise State court decisons, on a doubtful construction,
that an interest in land held by patent was a contract, and the
owner entitled to constitutional protection by our decision in
case of abuse and trespass by an oppressive exercise of State
authority, it would follow, that all State laws, special and general, under whose sanction roads, ferries, and bridges are established, would be subject to our supervision. A new source of
jurisdiction would be opened, of endless variety and extent, as,
on this assumption, all such cases could be brought here for fitual
adjudication and settlement; of necessity, we would be called
on to adjudge of fairness and abuse to ascertain whether jdirisdiction existed, and thus to decide the law and facts; in short,
to do that which State courts are constantly doing, in an exercise of jurisdiction over peculiarly local matters; by which
means a vast mass of municipal powers, heretofore supposed
to belong exclusively to State cognizance, would e taken
from the States, and exercised by the general government,

Some of the distinctions stated between bills of reiiew, of reviver, and supplemental

This court, as an appellate court, has the power to allow amendments to be made to
the record before it, although the general practice has -been to remand the case to
the Circuit Court for that purpose.
When a cause is brought before this court on a division in opinion by the judges of
the Circuit Court, the points certified only are before it. The cause should remain
on the docket of the Circuit Court, and at their discretion may be prosecuted.
If the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court be not shown in the proceedings in the case,
its judgment is erroneous, and liable to be reversed ; but it is not an absolute
nullity.
But when an amendment to the record was made by conseftt of counsel in this court,
which amendment set forth the jurisdiction, a mandate containing that amendment
ought to have prevented any subsequent objection to the jurisdiction in the Circuit Court.
A decree for a sale, made with the approbation of counsel filed in court, removes all
preceding technical objections.
Where a party interested consented to the sald of property, afterwards took the
benefit of the insolvent law, and at a subsequent period counsel representing him
filed a consent decree to complete. the sale, the trustee having taken no steps for
two years to connect himself with the proceedings in court, and then having suf- fered fifteen years more to elapse without moilng in the business, it is too late for
such trustee to object to the consent decree.
So, also, the holders of bridge bills, who had no specific lien upon a bridge, must be
considered to have lost their right to impugn the sale ps fraudulent, after so long a
lapse of time.
