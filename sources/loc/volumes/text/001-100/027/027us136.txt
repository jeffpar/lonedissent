SUPREME COURT.

DANIxEL

AND JOSEPH JACSON, PL41NTTS IN 'EREbR I&. JOHN

â€¢TWENTYMlEN.

The Ilth section of the act of 1789, hust 'be construed in connexion-with and
in conformity with the constitution of the United States. By this lattir, the
judicial power does not extend to private suits-in which an alien is a .party,
unless a ciizen be the adverse, party ;- and it is indispensable to aver the citizenship of the defendants, to show, on the record, the jurisdiction of the court.

THIS cause was brought before the Court 'by a writ of
error to the circuit court of the southern circuitof New
York.
The description'of" the parties on the record was "John
Twentyman, a subject of the king of Great Britain vs. Daniel
ahd Joseph Jackson." No citizenship of the defendants being
argued.
The question was whether the circuit court under the
11th section of the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20, sihich gives
jurisdiction, among other cases, "1where'ap alien is a party,"
had jurisdiction of the cause without an assumpsit on the
record-of the citizenship of thi defendants.
Mr Taylor, for the plaintiffs in error;'.argued that th judgment of the circuit 'court snodld be reversed. He cited
Bingham vs. Cabot, S Dall. 282. Hodgison vs. Bqwerbant,
5 CrancA, '303. Sullivan vs. The Folton 'Steam_ Poat. Company, 6 f-heaton, 450.
.The Court were of opinion that the 11th sectiqn of the
act must be construed in connexion 'with and in conformity
to the constitution of the United States. That by the latter,
the judicial power was',not extended to private .suits, in
which an alien is a party, unless a citizen be the adverse
party. :It Wa s indispensable therefore to aver lthe citizenship of -the defendants, in order to show on the record the
jirisdiction of the court.
The omission" so to do was fatal, and according to the
known course of the decisions of the Coirt, ihe judgment of
the ciicit court ,must-be reyersed, for want of juiisdicition.
