plaintiffs' improvement on their machines, is made the measure of his loss. If the plaintiffs, unable to furnish any other
data for a calculation, had proved that the defendants had
made a certain amount of money by putting out the :ffres in
New York, which the plaintiffs would otherwise have made
by use of their invention, he-might with some reason contend
that this was a proper measure.
But if he fails to furnish any evidence of the proper data
for a calculation of his damage, be should not expect that a
jury should work out a result for him by inferences or presumptions founded on such subtile theories.
We therefore direct the case to be remanded- for a venire

ROUTH, APPELLANTS, v. LORENzo N. ENEQUIT, OWNER OF THE
BRIG GoTELAND.
The admiralty jurisdictionof the cour sf

the United States extends to contracts

of charter-party and affieightmenL These are naritime contracts within the
true meaning and construction of the Constitution and act of Congress, and
cognizable ini courts of admirality, by prdcess either in rem or inperonam.
Appellants should not expect this court to reverse a decree of the Circuit Court,
merely upon a doubt created by conflicting testimony.

THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United

States for the southern district of New York.
It was a case in admiralty, arising under the following circumstances:

The brig Gothland, owned by Enequist, was chartered by
Burt, Myrtle, & Co., of Batavia, to proceed to Padung, on the
island of Sumatra, there to receive a quantity of coffee; to return thence to Batavia and complete her c0rg6, 'anddeliver the
same in New York, freight to be-paid by. the as ignees of the
bills of lading on delivery of the cargo.
It was admitted that the bills of lading were assigned .f6r
value to the appellants, composing the firm of G. B. Morewood & Company.

SUPREME COURT.
forewood et al. v. Enequgst.
Enequist first filed a libel in rem against the cargo for the
amount of the freight; but after some proceedings which it is
not necessary to mention, this action was discontinued, and a
libel in personam filed, which is the present case. The respondents alleged that, owing to the neglect of the carrier, the
coffee, black pepper, and cassia, were damaged to the amount
of $4,720.60, which they claimed as a deduction from the
freight. The whole freight claimed was $9,160.56, with interest from April, 1853.
The District. Court referred the case to a commissioner,
who reported that the freight due in September, 1857, was
$11,372.56, for which amount a decree was rendered, with
costs.
The case, being carried to the Circuit Court, was there tried
on the appeal frbm the District Court and on additional evidence taken by the respondents. The decree of the District
Court was affirmed with costs, and the respondents appealed
to this court.
It was submittef on printed arguments by Mr. Dodge and
Mr. Johnson for the appellants, and by Mr. Donohue for the
appellee.
The counsel for the appellants considered that the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States over an action on contract by a libel in personam in admiralty upon a contract of
affreightment was still an open question, and therefore proceeded to argue it. The elaborate arguments against the jurisdiction filed by them, and for it by Mr. Donohue, are omitted
by the reporter, in deference to the opinion of the court.
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.
The ship Gothland, owned by Enequist, the libellant, was
chartered by Burt, Myrtle, & Co., of Batavia, to proceed to
Padung, on the island of Sumatra, there to receive a quantity
of coffee; to return thence to Batavia and complete her cargo,
and deliver the same in New York, freight to be paid by the
assignees of the bills of ladihg on delivery of the cargo. The

libellants' suit is it personam against the consignees or assignees of the cargo, for the amount of freight stipulated in
the charter-party.
The only defence alleged in the answer is, that a portion of
the merchandise delivered was not in good order, and had
been greatly damaged by sweating, caused by want of proper
ventilation on the voyage.
This defence was fully discussed and examined both in the
District and Circuit Court, and a decree was entered for the
libellant in both.
In the argument in this court, the counsel, without aban.
doning the original defence, have expended much learning and
ingenuity in an attempt to demonstrate that a court of admiralty in this country, like those of England, has no jurisdiction
over contracts of charter-party or affreightment. They do
not seem to deny that these are maritime contracts, according
to any correct definition of the terms, but rather require us
to abandon our whole course of decision on this subject, and
return to the fluctuating decisions of English common-law
judges, which, it has been truly said, "are founded on no
uniform principle, and exhibit illiberal jealousy and narrow
prejudice."
The errors of those decisions. have mostly been corrected by
legislation in the country of their origin; they have never been
adopted in this.
We do not feel disposed to be again.drawn into the discussion of the arguments which counsel have reproduced on this
subject. The case of the New.Jersey Steamboat Company v.
the Merchants' Bank of Boston (6 How., 834) was twice
argued (in 1847 and 1848) at very great length. The whole
subject was mosi thorohghly investigated both by counsel and
the court. Everything connected with the history of courts
of admiralty, from the reign of Richard the Second to the
present day-everything which the industry, learning, and
research, of most. able counsel could discover, was brought
to our notice. We then decided that charter-parties and contracts of affreightment are "maritime contracts" within the
true meaning and construction of the Constitution and act of

SUPREMIE COURT.

Congress, and cognizable in courts of admiralty by process
either in rem or in personam.
Lord Tenterden admits that, by the maritime law, "the slhip
is bound to the merchandise and the merchandise to the ship;
and it is a necessary consequence that the contract is as much
a maritime contract as a bottomry or respondentia bond, or
mariners' wages." See Abbot on Shipping. But in England
they cannot have the benefit of this lien or privilege, because
courts of common law cannot enforce a lien in rem, and will
not permit the court of admiralty, to do it. Our District
Courts had exercised this jurisdiction without question till the
case just mentioned came before this court. Since that time
no objection has been raised in this court to the jurisdiction
of courts of admiralty over contracts of affreightment. See
Rich v. Lambert, 12 Howard, 347, &c., &c.
The numerous briefs of argument filed in this case contain
nothing which was not brought to our notice in the former
discussions of this subject, except some remarks on the case
of the People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, (20 How., 401.) It has
been contended that this case has established the doctrine,
that the jurisdiction of our courts of admiralty under the Constitution should be restrained to that which they were permitted to exercise in the Colonies before the Revolution. The
court decided in that case that a contract to build a ship is not
a maritime contract; and though, in countries governed by the
civil law, courts of admiralty may have taken jurisdiction of
such contracts, yet that in this country they are purely local,
and governed by State laws, and should be enforced by their
own tribunals. As a cumulative argument, it was stated that
the act of Congress of 1789 was not intended to conflict with
the rights of the State tribunals to enforce contracts governed
by their own laws, and not strictly of a maritime nature; that
such contracts were thus considered at the time the Constitution was formed, and had never been previously cognizable in
courts of admiralty as within the category of maritime contracts; and that the contest of jurisdiction in that case "was
not so much between rival tribunals as between distinct sovereignties claiming to exercise power over contracts, property,

and personal franchises." The arguments used in stating the
opinion of the court must be referred to the subject before it,
and construed in connection with the question to be decided.
They had no reference'whatever to any former decisions of this
court an the question r.ow (it is hoped for the last time) mooted
before us.
There is much testimony in the record of this case, on the
issue -made by the answer, with the usual discrepancy and
contradiction in matters of opinion. The Iuestion whether
the cargo was injured through the negligence and fault of the
master, or whether the damage to it was,caused by the innate
vice of the cargo and its necessary, exposure on the voyage,
was a very complei one, depending wholly on the opinion of
experts. Where witnesses of proper dkill and experience have
formed their judgment from a personal examination of the
subject of the controversy, their opinions are generally more
worthy of confidence thau those elicited by.hypothetical questiofs, which may or may'not state all the accidents and circumstances necessary to form a correct conclusion.
The decision of this case by the District and Circuit Courts
is supported by the testimonJ7 of numerous witnesses, who
had both .the capacity and experience to judge, and had examined the suject pf the controversy. We see no reason to
dispute the correctness of their judgment, or to enter into a
particular examination of the conflicting testimony in order to
vindicate the correctness of our own. We have frequently
said that appellants should not expect this court to reverse a.
decree of the Circuit Court merely upon a doubt created by
conflicting testimony.
The judgment.of the Circuit Court is affirmed with costs.
