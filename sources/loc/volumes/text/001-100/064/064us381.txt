DECEMBER TERM, 185!.
Zabs-ko v. Cleveland, Columbus, and CinctnnatiRailroad Co. et al.

CHRIstIAN A. ZABRISKIE, APPELLANT, V. THE CLEVELAND, COLUMBUS, AND CiNCiNNATI RAILROAD COMPANY, AND JOHN A.
':BUTLER, AND OTHERS.
In 1851, the Legislature of Ohio passed a general law relating to railway cornpamies, winch empowered them at any time, by means of their subscription to
the capital stock of any other company or otherwise, to aid such other railroad
company, provided no such aid shall be furnished until, at a called meeting
of the stockholders, two-thirds of the stock represented shall have assented
thereto.
In 1852, another act was passed for the creation and regulation of incorporatee
companies in Ohio, re-enacting the above section, and providing further, that
any existing company might accept any of its provisions, and when so ac.
cepted, and a certified copy of their acceptance filed with the Secretary of
State, that portion of their charters inconsistent with the provisions of this ac
shall be repealed.
le Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Company, when they en
dorsed the bonds hereafter mentioned, had not formally complied with eithe:
of these requirements, had neither convoked a meeting of the stockholder,
nor signified their acceptance to the Secretary of State.
In April, 1854, the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Compan3
endorsed a guaranty upon four hundred bonds of one thousand dollars each,
with interest coupons at seven per cent. interest, issued by the Columbus,
Piqua, and Indiana Railroad Company.
A stockholder in the Cleveland, &c., Cbmpany filed a bill to enjoin the directors
from paying the interest upon the bonds winch they had thus guarantied,
upon the ground that these directors had exceeded their legal authority in
making the guaranty. Some of the bondholders came in as defendants with
the corporation.
As between the parties to this suit, the acceptance of the acts of 1851 and 1852
may be inferred from the conduct of the corporators themselves. The corporation have executed the powers and claimed the privileges conferred by
them, and they cannot exonerate themselves from the responsibility by assert
ing that they have not filed the evidence required by the statute to evince
their decision.
Amongst the acts of the corporators was this-that at a meeting of the stockholders of the Cleveland Company, in July, 1854, the endorsement of the bonds
was approved, adopted, and sanctioned, and this resolution has never been
rescinded at any subsequent annual meetings, of which there have been several, at which the complainant was represented. His proxy was also present
at the meeting of July, 1854, but ,declined to vote, whei his vote would have
controlled the action of the meeting.
These negotiable securities have been placed on sale ii the community, accompanied by these resolutions and votes, inviting public confidence, and a cor

poration cannot , by their representations or silence, involve others in onerous
engagements; and then defeat the calculations and claims their own conduct
has superinduced.

THIs was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the northern district of Ouo.
Zabriskie was a citizen of the State of 1ew York, and a
stockholder in the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Company He filed a bill against the company, and obtained an injunction to restrain them from paying any money
in discharge of the interest to become due on four hundred
bonds of the Columbus, Piqua, and Indiana Railroad Company, which said bonds had been endored by the former company conjointly with the Bellefontaine and Indiana RAilroad
Company, and the Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh
Railroad Company Butler, Belknap, and Callender, citizens
of Connecticut, obtained leave to become parties to the suit,
as defendants, upon the allegation that each of them was the
holder of a bond or bonds which had been thus endorsed.
After much testimony was taken, and other proceedings
had, the Circuit Court, in March, 1858, dissolved the injunctiou and dismissed the bill. The complainant appealed to this
court.
It was argued by Mr Otis and Mr Benjamm for the complainant, and by Mr Stanberry and Mr -Ewmgfor the defendants, Mr Ewng being the solicitor for the bondholders.
The history of the case is given in the opinion of the court,
and it will be perceived, by the syllabus prefixed to this report,
how many points were raised in the argument and decided by
the court. The examination of the laws of Ohio was very extensive, too much so to be followed by the reporter. All that
he can do is to state the points made, from which the line of
argument can be easily deduced.

Zabriskie v. Clevdand, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Co. et a.

L Had the directors of the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Company the power to endorse the bonds of
the Columbus, Piqua, and Indiana Railroad Company?
II. Were said bonds and the endorsement thereon void iri
the hands of Neil & Dennison, and of those claiming under
them?.
III. Are the defendants, Butler, Belknap, and Callender,
bona fide holders of said endorsements, without any notice,
actual or constructive, of the circumstances under which the
endorsements were made, or of the want of power on the part
of the directors of the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati
Railroad Company to make the same9
IV Has the complainant fQrfeited his right to the relief
which he seeks by .any neglect on his part?
Upon the first point, the following positions were maintamed.
The company had no powerto endorse under their charter.
They had no power to endorse under the, act of March 30,
1851
First. Because said act had been repealed.
Second. Because the General Assembly intended to repeal
said act.
Third. Because the endorsement was not made for any of
the objects authorized by said act.
Fourth. Because the endorsement was not made with reference to said act of March 3d, 1851, as the source of power, but
with reference to the charter.
Fifth. Because, in making said endorsement, there was no
compliance with the imperative prerequisite conditions of said
act.
Sixth. Because neither the complainant nor any considerable number of the stockholders of said company ever consented to said endorsement , either directly or by implication.
Seventh. Because said-act of March 8d, 1851, is unconstitutional.
Upon the last point, the following brief extract from the
argument of Afr 01s will serve to illustrate his views
A. brief inquiry into the nature and extent of the authority

884

SUPREME COURT.

Zalinskme v. lveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Co. et al.

which the Legislature may lawfully exercise over railroad
companies, and also into the nature and extent of the changes
which the Legislature may make in the charters of such companies, with the consent of the organized bodies respectively,
without any well-founded legal objection on the part or any
individual stockholder, will throw much light upon the particular subject now under consideration, and tend to confirm
the conclusion that the act of March 3d, 1851, was an unconstitutional enactment.
The first branch of this inquiry is noc altogether free from
difficulty But this difficulty does not so much consist in laying down a general rule, as in applying the rule to each par.
ticular case which may arise. It is sufficient, however, foi
the present purpose, to say that grants to railroad companies
are strictly construed, and that the corporations take no rights
from the public beyond what the natural import of the words
used in their acts of incorporation rationally and properly conveys. These grants are never construed to embrace public
rights and duties, nor-can it be presumed that the Legislature
intended to part with the power of accomplishing the very
object for which railroad companies arc created. This
object is the comfort and convenience of the public, and
whatever regulations will tend to secure or promote that object theoLegislature may enact, even though these regulations
may abridge the value of the rights previously granted. It is
upon this ground that railroad compatnes may be lawfully required to fence their roads, construct cattle guards, diminish
the speed of their trains, and generally submit to such police
regulations in respect to the management of their repective
rQads as wvill most effectually secure the safety of the persons
and property transported over the same, and so long as the
Legislature shall confine its action to the due exercise of the
rights granted, no question can arise as to the lawfulness of
such legislation.
The second branch of the inquiry depends upon a very different principle, and although I cannot describe by general
definition all the particular changes which may be made in
the charters of railroad companies, with the consent of such

DECEMBER TERM, 1859.

companies, without any well-founded legal objection on the
part of any individual stockholder, a recurrence to the nature
of these charters will enable us to attain all that certainty in
this particular which the argument demands. A railroad
charter once accepted becomes a contract, and though the
charter is an entirety, it is in fact a two-fold instrument both
in regard to its subject matter and the parties thereto. So far
as the charter relates to the object of the grant, the mode of
carrying the same into execution, or the organs through which
the company may act, it constitutes a contract between the
State and the organized body, and it is competent for the
company, acting in the manner prescribed in its charter, to accept of any amendments touching these subjects which the'
Legislature may propose, even though these amendments are
evidently less beneficial to the company than the original act.
To this contract the individual stockholder is not a party except as a member of the organized body And as it is a fundamental principle of all associations of this kind, that the act
of the majority is the act of all, the organized body will be
bound by the action of the majority, however vehemently a
minority of individual stockholders may dissent therefrom. It
is upon the ground that the contract is one between the State
and the corporation as the sole parties thereto, and not upon
any implied assent, on the part of individual stockholders on
becoming members of the corporation, to such changes as shall
be auxiliary to the object of the grant, that all the stockholders
are bound by such legislation. But so far as the charter relates to the obligation of the company:to expend all its subscriptions solely for the specified purposes of the grant, or, in
other words, in the construction and equipment of its road, or
to the right of each individual stockholder to his ratable share
of the net earnings of the company in the shape of dividends,
or to his right.to vote upon each share of stock owned by him
in the election of a board of directors, it ipa contract between
each individual stockholder and the organized body, made in
pursuance of the authority conferred by the State. To this
contract the State is,
not a party, but the individual stocl=.
holder on the one hand, and all the other stockholders fornuig

the organized body on the other, are the sole parties to he
contract. And although the nature of this contract is such that
it cannot be changed, even by the consent of the parties to it,
without legislative permission, such permission does not confer
upon either party the authority to make such change without
the consent of the other party This contract between the individual stockholder and the corporation is essentially like a
contract of copartnership, and can no more be changed thani
any other private contract without the consent of the parties
thereto.
NVatusch v. Irving et al., Gow on Part., Appendix, 576.
Livingston v. Lynch, 4 Johns. Chy., 573.
Angell and Ames on Cor., secs. 536, 537, 538:
The fact that no individual stockholder can maintain a suit
in regard to his individual rights or interests until after the
company, upon request made, shall have neglected or refused
to protect-the same, does not militate against this view of the
-duality of all such contracts,.for the corporation is the legally
constituted trustee of every individual stockholder, through
which alone he must in the first instance seek redress. There
are no difficulties connected with this question in its relation
to this case except those which have arisen from the illogical
mode of treating it. If the act of March 3d, 1851, was intended to confer upon a majority of the stockholders of the
Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad Company authority to take the money due to the stockholders as dividends,
and to appropriate it to any of .the purposes mentioned in the
iourth section of-said act, against the consent of a single stockholder, though owning but a single share of stock, the enactment transcended the constitutional power of the Legislature,
and was void. The Legislature cannot authorize any number
of the stockholders of. a railroad company, under any pretext
whatever, to seize the money due to a co-stockholder as dividends, and appropriate it to any purpose not specified in its
charter, or to confiscate his property, or compel him to .sell
out his capital stock at, any priee, and abandon the company,
unless such power is reserved in the act of incorporation. The
obligation of the contract, which relates to a single share of

DECEMBER TERM, 1859.

387

Zbnrs ie v. CMwdand, Columbus, and CinctnnatiRailroad Co. et aZ.

the capital stock of a railroad company, can no more be impaired by legislative interference, than the obligation of the
contract which relates to the entire capital stock The protecting power of the Constitution extends to both alike.
As before stated, a railroad charter once accepted becomes
a contract. Until such charter shall be accepted, it is not a
contract; it is nothing more than a proposition, on the part
of the State, to the corporators named ii the act, to enter into
the contract specified therein. It has no binding force until
accepted, and in this respect a charter does not differ at all
from a proposition to enter into a private contract proceeding
from one individual to another. So where a charter has been
accepted, a subsequent amendment is also nothing more than
a proposition to change the original contract in that particular.
If the proposed change relates to the contract between, the
State and the organized body, it must be accepted by the
organized body before .it will have any bpdig force; but-if
the proposed change relates to the contract between the individual stockholder and the organized body, it mist be accepted by both the parties thereto before it will have any
binding force. If the proposed change be clearly beneficial
either to the individual stockholder or to the company, as the
case may be, and be auxiliary to the specified purposes for
which the company was created, the law will presume the
acceptance of such amendment by the~party to be benefited
thereby upon very slight grounds. But if the- proposed
change be not clearly beneficial to the individual stockholder,
or to the company, or if it extends the objects or increases
the liabilities of the company, or enlarges the powers of the
company over the stockholders,. as in the present case, the
acceptance of such amendment, by the party to be affected
thereby, must be clearly made. out by the party seeking to
establish the same. In cases of iAilroad, companies, where a
majority of the stockholders, are residents without the State
and country, as in this case, and are n9t expected to attend,
the meetings of the company, and who have a right to suppose
that the directors will confine themselves to the exercise ot
their legitimate powers, silence on the part-of the stockholders

SUPREME COURT.
Zabnukze v. UCeveland, Columbus, and CincinnatiRailroad Co. et al.

should not be regarded as an assent to, or an acquiescence in,
any changes in the contract between the corporation and the
stockholders affecting their individual interest; but it should
be established by clear affirmative proof that knowledge of
such change, and of its effects upon their interest, was brought
to the stockholders, and with such knowledge they deliber
ately assented thereto. Any rule short of this will expose to
imminent hazard the property invested in the railroads in this
State, and seriously impair the character of our legislation.
The argument upon the other points must be omitted for
want of room. All these points were sustained by Mr Benjamm also.
Mr Eibifig, for the bondholders, made the following points,
namely
1. The guaranty is valid in the hands of the present hold.
ers, independently of the act of March 4th, 1851.
2. The end and aim, the-object and purposes, to be effected
by this contract, were legitimately within the power of the
corporation, under and by virtue of the act of March 3d, 1851.
3. The fourth section -of the act of 1851, and its re-enactment in 1852, so far as it applies to pre-existing corporations,
does not impair the validity of the contract of subscription,
and is not unconstitutional and void.
4. The transaction out of which the guaranty arises comes
within the provisions of the fourth section of the act of March
4th, 1851.
5. The transaction is not void, as contended for by the
opposite counsel, under the fourth section of the act of March
3d, 1851, becauee the directors of the corapany acted in the
matter before they convened the stockholders to vote upon it.
6. The contract has been complied with by the other two
companies, and performance is, in equity, equivalent to consent.
Upon the third point, Mr Ewmg's views were as follows.
But it is contended, on the other side, that the'fourth
section of the acu , f 1851, and its re-enactment In 1852, so far
as it applies to pre-e)Istiug crporations, impairs the validity

of the contract of subscription, and is therefore, as to them,
unconstitutional and void.

compulsory, authorizing this corporation to do an act which

violates the contract of incorporation, or the contract between
corporation and corporators; It has been well adjudged that
the mere extension of privileges by law is not a violation of
the contract of incorporation.
Grey v. the Monongahela N~avigation Company, 2 Watts
and Sug., 169.
The decision in the case of the Hartford and New Haven
Railroad Company v. Croswell, relied on by complainant's
counsel, bears strongly on this case. It involves these propositions
1. That the directors of the original corporation could lawfully accept and exercise the additional powers conferred on
them, and consequently that their acts, in pursuance of such
new powers, were valid. For if not so, the old corporation
remained unchanged, and the stockholder must have paid his
subscription to it.
2. That a stockholder who did not consent to the change
could not, against his will, be held a corporator in the modified corporation.
8. And I have no doubt that such stockholder might, oy
bill in chancery, presented in due time, have enjoined and
prevented the acceptance of- the new power, and the action
under it. But he could not lie by, suffer the directors to
accept the newly-conferred privileges, employ workmen and
build boats, and then enjoin the corporation from paying for
them. That would be this case, to which both of the above
cases are alike opposed in principle, for there are cases, and
this possibly one of them, in which a corporator may enjoin
the corporation from doing an act, or making a contract, not
within its powers at the time of its creation, but brought-within
them by a subsequent law But if he consent to the contract,
or acquiesce in it, until third persons have become involved,
his remedy is gone. It is of that class of cases in which

SUPREME COURT.
Zabrmke v. Clevelnd, Columbus, and Cinc?nnatiRailroad Co. ef al.

equity requires the utmost vigilance and promptitude. The
powers granted by the act of 1851 do not extend to a new
undertaking, but to a more full and perfect means of executing the original purpose of the charter, and it is the business
of the corporators to see that the additional powers are not
exercised to their injury If they neglect this, they, and not
innocent third persons, must suffer the consequence of their
laches.

Jackson v. Lumpkin, 3 Peters, 291.
Mumma v. the Potomac Company, 8 Peters, 286.
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL delivered the opinion of the court
The appellant is a stockholder of the Cleveland, Columbus,
and Cincinnati Railroad Company a corporation existing by
the law of Ohio, ana empowered to construct a railroad from
Cleveland south, and having a cspital of more than $4,800,000
distributed among above nine hundred stockholders: The appellant complains, that this corporation, in April, 1854, ille-gally endorsed a _guaranty upon four hundred bonds of one
thousand dollars each, wfth interest coupons at the rate of seven
per cent. per annum, payable to Elias Fossett or bearer in New
York, in 1869, that had been issued in that month by the
Columbus, Piqua, and Indiana Railroad Company, and which
were also endorsed by the. Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad
Company, and the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad
Company, to the prejudice of the stockholders, and the burden
of the resources of the said Cleveland corporation. The object
of the bill was to obtain a decree to restrain the company, pending the suit, from paying the interest, and upon a declaration
of the illegality of the bonds, to enjoin the corporation from
applying any of its effects to their redemption.
The three defendants are holders of five of the bonds, who
have availed themselves of the invitation of the bill to all their
class to become defendants, and who assert that they are bona
fide holders, and that their securities are valid obligations of

porations originated in n negotiation among their officers, iD

1854, to determine upon a uniform gauge for all their roads,
and to promote intimate connections in their transit operations. The Piqua road and the Indianapolis road were projected to
extend from Columbus to Indianapolis, (one hundred and
eighty-five miles,) and were partially finished at a gauge of four
feet eight and one-half inches, and had agreed to maintain this
gauge for their common interest. At Columbus they were to
connect with roads of the same gauge, leading through Ohio
and Pennsylvania to Philadelphia.
The Cleveland and the Bellefontaine railroads were constructed upon the Ohio gauge, of four feet ten inches, and the companies were interested to detach the other corporations from their
Pennsylvania connection, and to combine them with their own
and other companies, whose roads passed through Cleveland,
along the shores of the lakes into :New York, and connected
there with the railroad and canal communications of that State.
The Piqua road was at this time finished only forty-six miles,
and the company was embarrassed, and their work suspended.
for want of money The Indianapolis company were willing
to hange the gauge of their road to the Ohio pattern, but
were withheld by their -eontract with the Piqua Qompany In
January, 1854, the Piqua Company appointed a committee
from their board of directors to negotiate for money or securities sufficient to complete their road, -and to discharge their
debts,-other than bond debts, and were authorized to prepare
six hundred bonds of one thousand dollars each, of the-usual
-form, to be secured by a mortgage, being the third mortgage
of their franchises and road. They were also empowered todetermine the gauge of the road, and either to maintain their
existing connections, or to consent to the adoption of the Ohio
gauge in conjunction with the Indianapolis Company
This committee opened.their negotiations in Philadelphia,
but -pending these the vice president of the company (Denison) "sounded the inclinations? of the Cleveland Company,
by intimating that if that company would endorse a portion of
the bonds, and take some of the stock of the Piqua Company,
the Pennsylvania connection would be abandoned. Some
assurance having been given by the president of the. Cleveland

Company to him, he, with the financial agent of the company
(Niel) arranged a contract with the committee of the Piqua
Company to purchase the six hundred bonds, to guaranty a
subscription for $50,000 of their stock at par, and to assume
the control of the settlement of all controversies and questions
concerning the gauge of the road. These negotiations were
pending from the first week in February until the 25th of the
month, when the contract was reduced to writing, and the
price to be paid settled at $305,000. On the 7th of March,
1854, Dennison and Niel concluded a contract with the three
corporations, Cleveland, Indianapolis, and Bellefontaine, by
which they consented to the permanent adoption of the Ohio
gauge for the Piqua and Indianapolis roads, and those corporations agreed to guaranty four hundred of the bonds of the
Piqua Company before mentioned, and to subscribe for thirty
thousand dollars of their stock. This contract was reported
shortly after to the boards of the several corporations, and approved, and the bonds were issued and endorsed, and the stock
subscribed for in April, 1854. The tracks of the several roads
were altered to conform to this arrangement shortly after.
The negotiations and contracts of Dennison and Niel were for
their own account and benefit. The testimony is conclusive
of the fact that the members of the Piqua board were ignorant
of the assurances they had received of the disposition of the
Cleveland and other companies to enteranto such engagements.
Dennison had been a director of this company from its organization, but before signing the contract of the 25th February,
with the Piqua Company, he exhibited a written resignation,
and that resignation was entered upon the minutes of the board
before the approval of the contract or the issue of the bonds
to him and his associate.
This transaction was reported to the stockholders of the
endorsing corporations in July, 1854, and accepted by them as
the act of the company The board of directors of the Cleveland Company, on the 16th June, resolved, that there should
be submitted to a vote of the stockholders, at a meeting on the
1st July proximo, four propositions for the aid of othei' roads
desiring to form a connection with that company, under the

4th section of a statute of Ohio, passed 3d March, 1851.
Among these was the endorsement of four hundred bonds of
the Piqua Company Notice was given of this meeting by
advertisement in the daily papers of Cleveland and Columbus,
and a daily paper in New York, but it did not disclose the
object of the meeting. Above eighteen thousand shares of
stock were represented, and the following resolution was
adopted without a dissenting vote
Resolved, "That the endorsement jointly and severally with
the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad Company, and the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad Company, of four hundred thousand dollars of the third mortgage bonds of the Columbus, Piqua, and Indianapolis Railroad Company, by order
of the board, March 6th, 1854, be and the same is approved.
adopted, and sanctioned, by this meeting, as the proper act of
tins company"
But, although there was no dissent in the
vote, there was dissatisfaction openly expressed by the proxy
of the appellant, andof a majority of the stockholders represented at the meeting, and who declined to vote on the resolution. The bonds were offered for sale in the city of New
York in the summer of 1854 and the spring of 1855, under
an uncontradicted representation of their validity through the
votes above mentioned, and were freely purchased at fair
prices. The interest was paid by the Pic~ia Company until
October,'1855, when the instalment due in that month was
discharged by the endorsers in equal proportions. In the
spring of 1856, the Piqua Company having become insolvent,
the appellant served a notice upon the Cleveland Company
not to pay any portion of the principal and interest that might
become due on the bonds, and required them to sue for the
cancellation of their guaranty, and demanded his share of the
profits of the company, without the reservation of any part for
the payment of the bonds, and immediately after filed the bill
in this cause.
He-contends, that the sale by the Piqua Company to Denmson and Niel is void, under a statute of Ohio that prohibits
-any director of a railroad company to purchase, either directly
or indirectly, any shares of the capital stock, or any of the

SUPREME COURT.
Zabrzw v. Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincunnati Railroad Co. ed al.

bonds, notes, or other securities, of any railroad company of
which he may be a director, for less than the par value thereof; and it declares. "That all such stocks, bonds, and notes,
or other securities, that may be purchased by any such directors for less than the par value thereof, shall be null and void."
He insists that the endorsement of the bonds of the Piqua
Company was of no advantage to the Cleveland Company, but
was merely to consummate the success of a speculation of
Dennison and Niel-a speculation reprobated by the law of
Ohio, that the Cleveland Company were not empowered by
their charter to guaranty the contracts of corporations or individuals, that this endorsement was not required for the construction of the road, or in the course of the business of the
company, or to promote an end of the incorporation, and that
none of the acts of the General Assembly of Ohio authorize it.
He denies any efficacy to the vote of the stockholders in
July, 1854, because the notice was insufficient, in the length
of the time and in the failure to disclose the purpose of the
call, that more than one-half of the stock of the company was
not represented, and two-thirds of that present did not vote,
for the want of proper information and counsel on the subject.
That the meeting were ignorant of material facts, they were
not advised of the relations of Dennison and Niel to the Piqua
Company, and their connection with the bonds, when tle vote
was taken, and were deceived as to the coidition of the Piqua
Company He avers that the bondholders are chargeable with
notice of the fact that the endorsement was inade before the
meeting of the stockholders, and by the authority of the di
rectors only
The testimony does not convict the defendants--the bondholders-of complicity in the negotiations or contracts that
preceded the issue of the bonds, nor does any eqnfvocal circumstance appear in their purchase of those securities. 'Itis
proved that it is a common practice for railroad corporations
to make similar arrangements to enlarge their connections
and increase their business. The Cleveland Company had encouraged this practice by precept and exa-aple. In a report
of their board of directors, in January, 1854, the company

DECEMBER TERM, 1859.
Zabrzs'i v. Oleveland, Columbus=, and Cincznnati Railroad Co. et al.

were informed of their establishment of a line of first-class
steamboats between Cleveland and Buffalo, and of their guaranty of the bonds of other companies for three hundred thousand dollars, of subscriptions for stock to the extent of one
hundred thousand dollars, and of promised aid to still another
company They say- "These companies may need additional
assistance, and others proposing to intersect ours may,. by a
moderate loan of money or credit, be enabled to finish their
roads, and establish with us business relations, for the mutual
benefit of both ,parties, while the advances on our part may be
made safe and remunerative. Unless advised of your disapprobation, the board will continue to pursue this policy"
NTo such disapprobation was expressed as to check the board
of directors until the guaranty of these bonds~had been sanc=
tioned, in July, 1854, at a meeting of the stockholders. The
discussion was confined to the circle of the corporation, until
after the failure of the Piqua Company to pay P. seco d instalment ofinteredt. Then the appellant filed this bill.
The frame of the bill implies that this contract exceeds the
power of- the corporation, and cannot be confirmed against a
dissenting stockholder. His authority to file such a bill is
supported upon this ground alone. Dodge v. Walsey, 18

the requisite securities, and are required to exhibit annually a
clear and distinct statement of their affairs to a meeting of the
stockholders. In the year 1851 a general law relating to railway companies empowered them "at any time, by means of
their subscription to the capital stock of any other company,
or otherwnse, to aid such company in the construction of its
railroad, for the purpose of forming a connection of said lastmentioned road with the road owned by the company furnishing such aid, * * * and empowered any two or more
railroad companies whose lines are so connected to enter into
any arrangement for their common benefit, consistent with
and calculated to promote the objects for which they were
created Provided, that no such aid shall be furnished nor
any * * * arrangement perfected until a meeting of the
stockholders of each of said companies shall have been called
by the directors thereof, at such time and place and in such
manner as they shall designate, and the holders of at least
two-thirds of the stock of such company represented at such
meeting in person or by proxy, and voting thereat, shall have
assented thereto."
This section was re-enacted in the following year, in a general act for "the creation and regulation of incorporated companies in Ohio," which last act provides that "any existing
company might accept any of its provisions, and when so accepted, and a certified copy of their acceptance filed with the
Secretary of State. that portion of their charters inconsistent
with the provisions of this act shall be repealed." Curwen s

R is contended, that neither of these acts was accepted by
the Cleveland Company, that the act of 1852 superseded that
of 1851, and that the former could be accepted and become
obligatory upon the company only in the mode it prescribed.
Both of these are general acts, and were designed to enlarge
the faculties of these corporations, so as to promote their
utility, and to enable them to accomplish with more convenience the-objects of their incorporation. This act of 1851
does not divest any estate of the company or make such .i
radical change in their constitution as to authorize the mern-

hers to say that its adoption without their consent is a dissolution of the'body But for an intimation in an opinion of the
Supreme Court of Ohio (Chapman & Hlarkness v. M. R. and
L. E. R. R. Co., 6- Ohio R., N. S., 119) to the contrary, we
should have been inclined to adopt the conclusion that the
act of March, 1851, might be operative without the specific or
formalassent of the corporations to which it refers, and was
not superseded by the act of 1852, as to pre-existing corporations. Everhart v. P and U C. 1R. I. Co., 28 Penn. R., 840,

The jurisprudence of Ohio is averse to the repeal of statutes
by implication, and in the instance of two affirmative statutes,
one is not to be construed to repeal the other by implication,
unless they can be reconciled by no mode of interpretation.
Cass v. Dillon, 1 Ohio R., N. S., 607
The learned compiler -ofthe laws of Ohio retains the act of
1851 as valid, in respect to the corporations then existing.
But as between the parties on this record, the acceptance of
those acts may be inferred from the conduct of the corporators
themselves. The corporation have executed the powers and
claimed the privileges conferred by them, and they cannot
exonerate themselves from the responsibility, by asserting
that they have not filed the evidence required- by the statute
to evince their decision. The observations of Lord St.
Leonards in the House of Lords, (Bargate v. Shortridge, 5 H.
L. Ca., 297,) in reference to the effect of the conduct of a
board of directors as determining the liability of a corporation,
are applicable to this corporation, under the facts of this case.
"It does appear to me," he "says, "that if, by a course of
action, the directors of a company neglect precautions which
they ought to attend to, and thereby lead third persons to deal
together as upon real transactions, and to embark money or
credit in a concern of this sqrt, these directors cannot, after
five or six years have elapsed, turn round, and themselves
raise the objection that they have not taken thcse precautions,
and that the shareholders ought to have inquired and ascertained the matter * * * The way, therefore, in which I

propose to put it to yourlordships, in point of law, as this'.
the question is not whether that irregularity can be considered
as unimportant, or as being different in equity from what it is
in law, but the question simply is, whether, by that continued
course of dealing, the directors have not bound themselves to
such an extent that they cannot be heard in a court of justice
to set up, with a view to defeat the rights of the parties with
whom they have been dealing, that particular clause enjoining
them to do an act which they themselves have neglected to
do."
This principle does not impugn the doctrine that a corporation cannot vary from the object of -its creation, and that persons dealing with a company must take notice of whatever is
contained in the law of their organization. This doctrine has
been constantly affirmed in this court, and has been engrafted
upon the common law of Ohio. Pearce v. M. and I. R. R. Co.,
21 How., 441, Strauss v. Eagle Ins. Co., 5 Ohio, N. S., 59.
But the principle includes those cases in which a corporation
acts within the range of its general authority, but fails to corn-plywith some formality or regulation which it should not have
neglectedbut which it-has chosen to disregard.
The ingtances already cited of the course of dealing of this
corporation, and others of a similar nature, of which there is
evidence in the record, sufficiently attest that the corporation
accepted the acts of 1851 and 1852- as valid grants of power,
and it would be manifestly unjust to allow it to repudiate the
contracts which it has made, because their acceptance of these
grants has not begn clothed in an authentic form. The Supreme Court of Ohio have recognised the obligation of corporators to be prompt and vigilant in the exposure of illegality
or abuse in the employment of their corporate powers, and
have denied assistance to those who have waited till .the evil
has been done, and the interest of innocent parties has become
involved. Chapman v. Mad River R. R. Co., 6 Ohio, N. S.,
119, The State v. Van Horne, 7 Ohio, N. S., 327
We conclude, that the validity of the contract of the Cleveland corporation, under the circumstances, mast be determined on the assumption that it was authorized to exert the

power conferred in the fourth section of the act of March,
1851, and 24th section of the act of May, 1852.
In deciding upon the validity of this contract, we deem it
unimportant to settle whether Denmson was a director of the
Piqua Company the 25th February, 1854, when he signed the
contract with the committee of the Piqua board of directors,
or whether that contract was affected by its ratification by the
board after his resignation was entered upon the minutes, or
by the Atibsequent consummation of the contract, in the reciprocal transfer of the securities and payment of the consideration, or whether, as matter of law, the bonds of the Piqua
Company, commercial in their form, payable to another party,
and issued after his resignation, are null and void.
The contract of the guarantors endorsing the bonds is a distinct contract, and may impose an obligation upon them independently of the Piqua Company In the absence of a personal incapacity of Dennison to deal with his principal- the
issue of the bonds by the directors of the Piqua Company is
an ordinary act of administration, akid bonds in such form, it
is admitted, "challenge -confidence wherever they go." We
perceive no illegality in their delegation to them of the power
to determine whether the Ohio or Pennsylvaia gauge should
be adopted, or their sale of the privilege to adjust the controversies and questions relating to it. Their adoption of the
Ohio gauge was .a solution of all the difficulties, it enabled
the Indianapolis Company to adopt it, it superinduced the
resulting consequence of running cunnections among the four
corporations, it secured profits to the guarantors, it imposed
the burden of relaying their track upon the Piqua Company.
Their contract to adopt this gauge and to form the corresponding connections is a valuable consideration, and the Piqua
Company have fulfilled the engagements that Deniisoi and
Niel were authorized to stipulate on their behalf. There is
testimony that the bargain was a hard one for the guarantors,
and argument that it was probably an unjust one, and possibly
fraudulent in reference to the stockholders of the .Cleveland
Company But the bill is framed, not to obtain relief from
error or fraud in the administration of the powers of the com-

pany by their trustees, but against the exercise of powers that
did not belong to the corporation, and which the body could
not confirm, except by a unanimous vote. Foss v. Harbottle,
2 How., 461, 2 Phil. Ch. R., 740
We proceed to consider 16f the effect of the sanction given
to the arrangements of the Cleveland Company, through Dennison and Niel, with the Piqua Company, by the vote of the
meeting in July, 1854. It is objected that the notice of this
meeting was insufficient, and that, unprepared as the corporators were, the proxy appointed by the non-resident stockholders was overpowered by the heat and passion of the directors and their adherents. There is some force in the ,omplaint that this meeting was not conducted with a due respect
for the social rights of a portion of the stockholders. But the
tlime, place, and manner of the meeting were appointed by the
directors, as the act of 1851 permits. The proxy of the ap
pellant was there, exhibited his instructions, discussed the
propositions submitted, and declined to vote, when his vote
would hav~e-ntrolled the action of the meeting. Since that
time, several annual meetings have been held, at which the
appellant was represented. The circumstances of the contract
and its effects have been developed, and yet the resolution
sanctioning this contract has not been rescinded. It may be
that among tlie stockholders, Ind within the corporation, the
cause of this procrastination and hesitancy to act upon the
subject may be estimated properly But we are to regard the
conduct of the corporation from an -external position. The
community at large must form theirjrudgment of it from the
acts and resolutions adopted by the authorities of the corporation and the meeting of the stockholders, and by their acqui.
escence in them. These negotiable securities have been placed
on sale in the community, accompanied by these resolutions
and votes, inviting public confidence. Theylave circulated
without an effbrt on the part of the corporation or corporators to restrain them, or to disabuse those who were influenced
by these apparently official acts. Men have invested their
money on the assurance they have affordec.

careful adherence to truth in their dealings with mankind;
and cannot, by their representations or silence, involve others
in onerous engagements, and then defeat the calculations and
claims their own conduct had superinduced. The opinion of
the court is, that the injunction granted upon the bill of the
appellant wad improvidently granted, and that he -is not entitled to the relief he has sought; and that the decree of the
Circuit Court dissolving the injunction and dismissing the
bill is correct, and must be affirmed.
THE ORIENT MUTUAL INSURANOE COMPANY, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,
V. JOHN S. WRIGHT, USE OF AAXWELL, WRIGHT% & COMPANY.
An open or running policy of insurance upon L coffee laden or to be laden on
board the good vessel or vessels from Rio Janeiro to any port in the United
States, to add an additional premium if by vessels lower than A 2, or by for.
eign vessels," contained also the following clause, viz: "Having been paid the
consideration for this insurince by the assured or his assigns, at and after
the rate of one and one-half per cent., the premiums on risks to be fixed at
the time of endorsement, and such clauses to apply as the company may
insert, as the risks are successively reported."
"
This is different from an ordinary running policy, in which the rate of premium
to be paid is ascertained and inserted in the body of the policy at its execu.
tion, and in which species of-policy the contract becomes complete, and the
policy attaches upon the goods from the time they are laden on board the
vessel, as soon as the ship is declared or reported, provided the shipment
comes within the description in the policy.
The rules explained which govern this class of policies.
But in the policy in question there is something more to be done, in, order to
make the contract complete, than merely to declare the ship. The assured
must pay or secure the additional premium, which the underwriter has reserved the right to fix at the time of the declaration of the risk in, case the
,vessel rates lower than A 2.
Unless the assured paid or secured this additional premium fixed by the underwriter, the contract of insurance, in respect to the particular shipment, did
not become complete or binding.
Hence, the instruction of the court below was erroneous, which held that the
contract was complete and binding as soon as the vessel was reported; and
that, if the parties could not agree as to the additional premium, the question
was one for the courts to settle.
The parties stipulated that the additional premium should be fixed when the
risk was made known.
The cases upon this point cited.
