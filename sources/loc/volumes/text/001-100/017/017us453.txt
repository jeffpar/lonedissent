ORR v. HODGSON etux. et al.
-Bill for rescinding a contract for the sale of lands, on the ground of
defect of title, dismissed with costs.
An alien may take an estate in lands by the act of the parties, as by
purchase ; but he cannot take by the act of the law,. as by descent.
Where a person dies, leaving issue, who are aliens, the latter are not
deemed his heirs in law ; but the estate descends to the next of kin
who have an inheritable blood, in'the same manner as if no such
alien issue were in existence.
The 6th article of the treaty of peace between the United States and
Great Britain, of 1783, completely protected the titles, of British
subjects to lands in the U. S. which would have been liable to forfeiture, by escheat, for the defect of alienage. That articlewas
not meant to be confined to confiscations jure belli.
The 9th article of the treaty between the U. S. and G. B., of 1794,
applies to the title of the parties, whatever it is, and gives it the same
legal validity as if the parties were citizens. It is not necessary
that they should show an actual possession or seizin, but only that
the title was in them at the time the treaty was made.
The 9th article of the treaty of 1794 did not mean to include any other
persons than such as were British subjects or citizens of the U. S.

from the Circuit Court for the District
of Columbia.
The appellant filed his bill in equity in the Court
below, stating, that, on the 10th day of January,
1816, he purchased of the defendants, William
Hoegson, and Portia, his wife, and John Hopkins,
and Cornelia, his wife, a tract of land called Archer's
Hope, situate, in the County of James' City, in the
St-ate of Virginia, for the sum of 5,000 dollars, and
gave his bond to the said I-Iodgson and Hopkins for

the payment of the said purchase money.

That, at

the time of the purchase, the defendants affirmed to

the plaintif that they were seized in right of the

said Portia and Cornelia, of a good, sure, and indefeasible estate of inheritance, in fee simple, in the
said tract of land, and had full power and lawful
authority to convey the same, and, in consequence of
such affirmation, the plaintiff made the purchase, and
gave his bond, as aforesaid. And further stating,
that he had since discovered that the defendants had
no title to -the said lands, but that the title thereto
was either vested in the children of the Countess
Barziza, or that the Commonwealth of Virginia was
entitled to them by escheat. That Colonel Philip
Ludwell, a native of the said Commonwealth, being
seized in fee of the said lands, had. twq daughters,
Hannah and Lucy, born of the same mother, in Virginia. That, some years before the year 1767, he
removed with his family, including his said two
daughters, to England, where he died, in the year
1761, having, by his last will, devised all his estates
to' his said two daughters, and appointed as their
guardians, Peter Paradise, John Paradise of the city
of London, and William Dampier. That, Hannah,
one- of the -said daughters, married William Lee, a
native of Virginia, and died, leaving issue, two daughters the said defendants, Portia Hodgson and Cornelia Hopkins, who are citizens of Virginia, residing.
in the District of Columbia. ;That Lucy Ludwell,
the other daughter abovementioned, during her infancy, to wit, in May, 1769, at the city of London,

That the said Countess Barziza died intestate, in

plaintiff to be cancelled, the same having been obtained by misrepresentation or through mistake without any consideration valuable in law, and at the

Feb. 18th.

Mr. Justice SToR Y delivered the opinion of the warch 1ta.
Court, The whole merits of this cause rest upon
the question, whether the defendants, Portia Hodgson, and Cornelia Hopkins, took an estate in fee simple, in one moiety of the land stated in the bill, by
descent, as nieces"and heirs of Lucy Paradise, widow
of John Paradise, upon her death in 1814. If they
did, then the contract for the sale of the land to the'
plaintiff ought to be fulfilled; if.not,, then-the contract ought to be rescinded.
Two objections are urged'against the title. First,
that Lucy Paradise, at the time of her death, was a
British subject, and so not capable of passing the land
in question by descent ; secondly, if so entitled, yet,
upon her death, the land escheated to the commonwealth of Virginia, for want of heirs legally entitled
to take the same by descent.
It appears, that Lucy Paradise took her moiety of
the estate in question by d'evise from her father, Philip Ludwell, who was a native of Virginia, where,
also, his daughter Lucy was born. Sometime.' before the year 1767, he removed with his family, including this daughter, to England* where he died iia

1767. In 1769, this daughter was married in Eng7
land to John Paradise, (a British subject,) by whom
e
she had issue a daughter, Lucy, wh was born in
England, about 17-0, and who, afterwards, in 1787,.
in England, married Count Barziza, a Venetian subject, by whom she had two sons, one born in Venice
in lielruary, 1789, and the other in Venice, in August, 1796, both of whom are now living.' The
C6ttess Barziza died in Venice, in August, 1800,
leaving no other issue except her twvo sons, and neither she, nor her husband, nor her sons, were ever in
the United States. In the year 1787, John Paradise
came with his wife to Virginia, and returned with
her to England in the year 1789, where he 'died in
1796.' After the death of her husband, Lucy Para-.
dise treated the land in controversy as her own, exercising acts of ownership, over it; and about the year
1805, returned to Virginia, where she died intestate, in
,possession of the land, in 1814, leaving no issue but
her two grandsons, the children of the Countess
Barziza, and the defendants Portia and Cornelia,
her nieces, who would be her heirs at law if no such
issue were living.

prevent the estate from desconding to the nieces who
have a legal capacity to take, because, strictly speaking, they are not heirs. The law is certainly otherwise., Where a person dies, leavingZDissue, who are
aliens, the latter are not deemed his heirs in law, for
they have no inheritable blood, and the estate de-

scends to the next of kin, who have an inheritable
blood, in the same manner as if no such alien issue

hereafter considered. And this brings us to the other
question in the cause, whether Lucy Paradise, under
the circumstances of the case, had such an estate,
in the land, as could by law pass by descent to her
heirs.
There is no question that she took an estate in
fee simple by devise from her father; but it is
supposed, that although born in Virginia, by her removal to England, with her father, before, and remaining there until long after, the American revolution, she must be considered as electing to remain a,

under such circumstances, a seizure of the estate by
the government, upon an inquest of office, tor the supposed forfeiture, would have been a confiscation of the
property in the sense in which that term is used in the
treaty. When the 6th article of the treaty declared,
"that no future confiscation should be made," it
could not mean to confine the operation of the language to confiscations jure belli; for the treaty itself

inviolable. The fifth article of the treaty also*materially illustrates and confirms this construction. It
is there agreed, that Congress shall recommend to the
State legislatures to provide for the restitution of all
estates of British subjects, &c. which had been confiscated. Yet, why restore such estates, if, eo instanti,
they were forfeitable on account of alienage ? This
Subject has been heretofore before us, and although
no opinion was then pronounced, it was most deliberately considered. We do not now profess to go
at large into the reasoning upon which our present
opinion is founded. It would requite more leisure
than is eonsistent with other imperious duties; and
we must, therefore, content ourselves with stating, that
the doctrine here asserted is the decided judgment
of the Court.

be regarded as aliens. It does not appear, by
the bill in this case, that Lucy Paradise was in the
actual possession or seisin of' the land at the time of
the treaty. Nor is it necessary, because the treaty
applies to the title, whatever it is, and gives it the
same legal validity as if the parties were citizens."
But although it does not directly appear by the bill
what the title of Lucy Paradise was, at the time of
the treaty ; yet, as the title is asserted in her, both
before and after the treaty, and there is no allegation
of any intermediate transfer, it must be presumed in
this suit, that She never parted with her title. It follows, that in this view also, her title was Completely
confirmed, free from the taint of alienage; and, that
by the express terms of the treaty, it might lawfully
pass to her heirs.
And here it becomes material to ascertain whether
the treaty of 1794, under the description of heirs, meant
to include any other persons than such as were Bri-

was not to include any other persons. Itcannot be presumed, that the treaty stipulated for benefits to any
persons who were aliens to both governments. Such a
construction would give to this class of cases privileges
and immunities far beyond those of the natives of
either country; and it would also materially interfere with -the public policy common to both. We
have, therefore, no hesitation to reject any interpretation which would give to persons, aliens to both

We have not thought it necessary to go, into an
examination of the articles for a marriage settlement
entered into between Lucy Paradise and John Paradise, on their marriage, for two reasons : first, the
articles were merely executory, and, being entered
into by Mrs. Paradise when under age, and not afterwards ratified: by her, they were not binding upon
her; secondly, if they were binding, yet, inasmuch
as the only persons in whose favour they could now
be executed, are aliens incapable of holding.the estate
