RICHAID WALDEN AND OTHERS, HEIRS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF
AMIlBROSE WALDEN, DECEASED, .APPELLANTS, v. THOmAS BODLEY'S
HEIRS AND REPRESENTATIVES, ROBERT PoGum's HEIRS AND RErEESENTATIVES, AND OTHERS.
SAME v. SAME.
This court having sent a mandate to a Circuit Court to put a party into possession
of certain lands which were the'subject of an ejectment suit, it was right in the
Circuit Court not to extend the possession further than the land originally recovered in ejectmenti although other lands were afterwards drawn into the controversy.
Where a defendant in ejectment aliens the property in dispute whilst the proceedings
are pending, a possession by the vendee will not justify a plea of the statute of
limitations, This court having issued an order, after the expiration of the demise,
that the Circuit Court should place the plaintiff in possession, such an order proceeded on principles governing a court of equity, and the Circuit Court was
uounr1 to conform to it.
THESE two cases were brought up by appeal, from the
Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kentucky.
The canes were exceedingly complicated, and cannot be understood without a reference to the following plat.

JANUARY

TERM, 1850.

Walden et al. w. Bodley's Heirs et al.

The history and facts of the case are given so much in detail in the opinion of the court, that it is unnecessary to do
more than refer the reader to that opinion, as delivered by Nr.
Justice Catron.
It was argued by 31'r. Underwood for the appellants, and
Mr. 0. S. Morehead for the appellees. The only question
was, whether or not the Circuit Court had properly executed
the mandate of this court, and the arguments of the counsel
are noticed with sufficient clearness in the opinion of the court,
3s well as the facts in the case.
Mr. Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
These two cases were appeals from the Circuit Court of the
United States fo.r the District of Kentucky, sitting as a court of.
equity. They were in fact one case, and will be treated as
such.
The question was, whether the Circuit Court had properly
executed the mandate of this court issued after the decision in

36

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

a cause between the same parties at January term, 1840, and
reported in 14 Peters, 156. The judgment of this court in the
ejectment suit between Walden's lessee and Craig's heirs, involving the same title, settled the questions raised therein, and
was final.
The ejectment case will be found in 14 Peters, 147. The
present difficulty arose from the execution of the mandate of
this court in the chancery suit.
In order to give a clear understanding of the nature of the
dispute, it is necessary to refer to the plat, and disembarrass it
of all the locations which are unconnected with the present appeal. After explaining the pretensions of the appellant, it will
become necessary to give an historical narrative of the case in
all its diversified aspects, because the grounds of defence relied
upon by the appellee cannot be understood without such an
explanation. The dispute was of very long standing. The
title of Walden was collaterally brought before this court in
5 Cranch, 191, then directly in 9 Wheaton, 576, 14 Peters, 156,
and now reappears in 9 Howard.
The mandate issued in 1840 will be more fully stated hereafter. At present it is only necessary to say, that-it commanded the Circuit Court to take such further steps in regard to the
putting of Walden in possession of the premises recovered in
the ejectment suits as should be conformable to the decree
hereby affirmed, and to the principles of equity.
The appellant Walden complained that the Circuit Court
had not put him in possession of the tracts of land marked A,
B, and C, which it ought to have done, bounded as follows:A. 1, a, b) 4, 5, 6, 11, 1.

B. 15, 14, 5, 6, 11, 15.
C. 11, 30, 31, 32, 11.
Each of these pieces of land had its separate defence. A
brief explanation of the plat now becomes necessary.
The double lines 23, 24, 25, 26, are the lines of Walden's
entry, as the same were laid down by a surveyor under the
order of this court, and therefore Walden could recover nothing
outside of them.
7, 8, 9, 10, are the lines of his original patent, as laid down
by him.
The dotted lines 1, 2, 3, 9, represent the locator's or Craig's
part. But as these lines include land outside of the entry, they
must be made to conform to it, and therefore assume an irregular figure, running from 1, a, b, d, c, 2, 1.
It will be explained hereafter upon what grounds the defendants claimed to hold A, B, and C on the accompanying plat.

Walden et al: v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

To return to the history of the case.
1780, entry by Walden.
1783, entry by Bodley's grantors.
1785, survey by Walden.
1790, survey by Bodley's grantors.
In March, 1797, Walden brought an action of ejectment for
a tract of land lying on the waters of Johnson's Fork of Licking
River in Mason County. The action was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Kentucky District.
The declaration stated a demise for the term of ten years from
the 15th day of August, 1789.
In March, 1798, Lewis Craig and Jonathan Rose were substituted in place of the casual ejector, confessing lease, entry, and
ouster.
In June, 1800, a speoial case was submitted to the court, ac.companied with a survey. From these documents, it appeared
that a division of the land covered by Walden's patent had been
made in February, 1794; that two thirds of it had been assigned to Walden, and the remaining third to Craig, as assignee
of Simon Kenton, the locator; and that the defendants in .the
ejectment were in possessibn of that part which had been given
to the locator.
The case was submitted to the court upon this agreed state
of facts.
On the 19th of June, 1800, the court gave judgment for
Walden, the plaintiff in ejectment.
In August, 1800, Walden sued out a writ of haberefacias
possessionem upon this judgment. This writ was arrested by
an injunction, and returned unexecuted; and again renewed in
1811, as will be mentioned in chronological order.
In September, 1800, Bodley and others filed a bill upon the
equity side of the court, and obtained an injunction. This
bill is nowhere found upon The record, and its contents cannot
be more partiiularly stated.
In May, 1809, this bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
On the 5th of September, 1811, the execution which had
been taken out by Walden in 1800. was returned, and an6ther
writ of habere facias possessionem issued upon the 14th of
September.
In the latter part of September, 1811, Bodley and others filed
another bill, and obtained a second injunction to stay further
proceedings upon the judgment in ejectment.
At May term, 1812, the injunction was dissolved, on hearing
on bill, answers, depositions, and exhibits, and in April, 1813,
the complainants dismissed their bill.

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

On the 2d of June, 1812, Walden sued out another writ of
habere facias possessionemz, which was superseded, on the 8th
of June, upon two grounds; namely, that no execution ought
to have issued, on account of the lapse of time after the rendition of the judgment, and because the demise laid in the declaration had expired before the judgment was given.
At July term, 1813, the writ was quashed.
In August, 1817, a rule was laid upon the defendants, Craig
and Rose, to show cause why the demise in the declaration
should not be extended.
On the 22d of May, 1819, Walden took out another writ of
haberefaciaspossessionem, which was afterwards quashed by
the court.
At November term; 1821, the rule came up for argument,
when the court overruled the motion to extend the demise.
Walden sued out a vrit of error, and brought this judgment up
to this court to be reviewed. It came up for argument at February term, 1824, and is reported in 9 Wheaton, 576. This
court having expressed its opinion that the motion to extend
the demise ought to have prevailed in the Circuit Court, leave
was granted by the Circuit Court, at the ensuing May term,
to amend the declaration by extending the demise to fifty
years.
In March, 1825, Bodley and Pogue obtained a decree against
Walden in the Fleming Circuit Court of Kentucky (State
court), upon a bill which they had filed against him to prevent
him from proceeding. further in his action of ejectment. The
decree was founded upon the superior equity in the claim of
Bodley and Pogue,- inasmuch as Walden's survey in 1785 interfered with the prior entry of the grantors of Bodley and Pogue,
in 1789.
In 1825, Bodley and Pogue filed a bill in the Circuit Court
of the United States, into which court were removed all the
proceedings of the Fleming Circuit Court just mentioned.
Upon this bill an injunction was granted, prohibiting Walden
from proceeding further under his judgment in ejectment.
Walden answered, and afterwards filed a cross-bill and an
amended cross-bill.
In 1833, the suit was revived by consent, in the names of
the heirs and representatives of Bodley and Pogue, who had
died.
In May, 1835, Thomas Blair, who claimed under Pogue,
filed a petition in the Circuit Court to reverse and annul the
order extending the demise, upon the ground that the order
was surreptitiously obtained and improvidently made.

JANUARY TERM, 18.0.

39

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Hcirs et al.

In May, 1836, the court overruled this motion to annul the
extension of the demise.
On the 18th of November, 1836, Walden sued out a writ of
haberefaeias.possessionemfor a part of the land claimed in the
original ejectment. On the ensuing day, being the 19th of
November, the defendant's counsel moved to quash this writ,
upon the ground, amongst other reasons, that it was irregular
to issue the writ without a previous scire facias, because the
judgment had been obtained twenty years before. On the 21st
of November, the court quashed the writ.
In March, 1837, Walden sued ouit a scirefacias to revive the
judgment. Blair was made a defendant, as tenant in possession.
The defendants demurred to the scirefacias, and also pleaded
nul tiel record. The court gave judgment for the defendants
upon the demurrer and the plea, and 'the case was brought up
to this court by a writ of error. It was decided at January.
term, 1840, and is reported in .14 Peters, 147.
In the mean time, the bill filed in the Circuit Court by Bodley and others, in 1825, had ripened into'a decree. After various proceedings, the Circuit Court, at November term, 1834,
decrced, that Walden had rthe superior equity to all the* land
included within the double black lines, and humbered 23, 24,
25, 26, and that for other lands lying outside of these lines, and
within the lines of his patent, he should execute deeds to the
complainants.
Upon the subject of damage and waste, rents and profits, and
improvements, the court appointed commissioners to go upon
the land arid make assessments.
At May term, 1836, the report of these commissioners was
quashed, and other commissioners appointed.
This decree of the Circuit Court was appealed from by Walden, brought up to this court, and is reported in 14 Peters, 156.
The decree of the court below was affirmed, and the cause returned with the following mandate: "Whereas, lately, in the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of' Kentucky, before you, or some of you, in a
cause between Thomas Bodley's heirs, Robert Pogue's heirs,
and others, complainant, and Ambrose Walden, defendant, the
decree of the said Circuit Court was in favor of the said, complainants, and against the defendant, as by the inspection of the
transcript of the record of the said Circuit Court, which was
brought into the Supreme Court of the United States by virtue
of an appeal, agreeably to the act of Congress in such. case
made and provided, fully"and at large appears. .-And whereas,

40

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

in the present term of January, in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and forty, the said cause came on to
be heard before the said Supreme Court on the said transcript
of the record, and was argued by counsel. On consideration
whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this
court, that the decrees of the said Circuit Court be, and the
same are hereby, affirmed, with the modification that this cause
be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said Circuit Court,
with directions to that court to take such further steps in regard to the improvements, and to the putting of Walden or his
representative in possession of the premises recovered in the
ejectment suits, as shall be conformable to the decree hereby
affirmed, and to the principles of equity.
"You, therefore, are hereby commanded, that such further
proceedings be had in said cause as according to right and justice and the laws of the United States ought to be had, the
said appeal notwithstanding.
" Witness the Honorable Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of
said Supreme Court, the second Monday of January, in the
year of our Lord one ti ousand eight hundred and forty.
"Wk. THos. CARROLL,
Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United States."
Upon the receipt of this mandate, the Circuit Court took
steps to execute it by granting leave to both parties to take depositions, ordering the surveyor to amend his survey, if necessary, and report matters of fact spe~ially.
At November term, 1841, Walden's death was suggested,
and a bill of revivor filed on behalf of his heirs, which included
a prayer. to revive the proceedings in the suit wherein Walden
was defendant, to which the mandate referred, ana also the
proceedings under the cross-bill which bad been filed by Walden. Whereupon, subpcenas were issued to bring fifty-six parties into court, who were the representatives of Bodley, Pogue,
and the other persons whose interests were opposed to Walden.
After another bill of revivor, and another amended bill, and
sundry other proceedings, the cause came before the Circuit
Court for final adjudication at May term, 1847. The court ordered the heirs of Walden to be placed in possession of several
of the pieces of land claimed, but refused to give them those
pieces marked upon the preceding plat with the letters A, B,
and C. An.appeal was taken from this decree by the heirs of
Walden, and the correctness of this refusal by the Circuit Court
was the question brought up by the appeal.
As each one of the tracts A, B, C, had a different defence, it
will be necessary to enumerate them in order.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

41

Walden et al. v. "Bodley's Heirs et al.

A. The jhdgment of the Circuit Court respecting this tract
was as follows, viz.: "It seems to the court that the heirs of Walden are not entitled to obtain, by this proceeding against John N. Proctor, the
possession of the parcel of land designated on the plat of the
survey by the letters and figures 1, a, b, 4, 5, 6, 11, 1; it was
acquired of one of the complainants in the original bill, but at
a time when there was no litigation pending. Jonathan H.
Rose purchased this land in 1814 of Jonathan Rose, then in
possession for upwards of seven years under a junior patent,
and thereupon took possession, and resided upon it until he sold
it to Proctor, the defendant, who resided upon it until about
the time of the commencement of this proceeding, when he
sold it to Kincaid, now in possession. And it seems to the
court that the possession so held by Jonathan H. Rose, and his
successor, Proctor, for upwards of seven years before the original bill in this case was filed, and upwards of twenty years before he was in any wise a party to any litigation concerning the
land, does constitute a bar under the statute of limitations, and
that this part of the case is within the exception of the decree
and mandate of the Supreme CourZ, and that the Waldens are
not, upon the principles of equity, entitled to have the possession of this part of the land; and therefore their bill and proceedings in respect to it are dismissed."
It will be perceived by a reference to the plat, that the whole
of this tract of land lies within both Walden's entry and patent,
and also within what was called the locator's part. This court
in 1840 decided that Walden's title was good to all the land
included within his entry, namely, all included within the
double black lines; and decided also, that Craig's title, claimed
under Kenton, the locator, was not valid. 14 Peters, 162. It
remains to trace the title claimed under the defence of limitations.
The title adverse to Walden's is thus traced by the counsel
for Proctor, the present occupier and claimant.
After the expiration of the demise in said Walden's declarations, namely, in the latter part of the year 1800, as your petitioner is advised, Rose, the tenant in possession, purchased
the land claimed by said Walden from Bodley and Pogue, who
claimed under a patent in the name of Tibbs & Co. for 10,000
acres of land, posterior in date to that of said Walden, and adverse thereto, for which he held the bond of said Bodley and
Pogue for 131 acres, which bond was satisfied by the execution
of a deed, September, 1821.
Between the years 1814 and 1819, and while the said de4*

42

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

mise continued dead, your petitioner believes about the year
1816 or 1817, said Rose sold by executory contract the said
tract of land to his son, Jonathan H. Rose, and delivered the
possession thereof to him; and the said Jonathan H. Rose continued on said land, and was in fact the terre-tenant at the date
of the extension of the demise, namely, the 8th of May, 1824;
and the said Jonathan H. had no notice or knowledge whatever of said extension, but the whole proceeding as to him was
ex parte. And your petitioner states, that, during the year
1826, he purchased by bond of said Jonathan H. Rose, and
took possession of said land in March, 1827; and shortly afterwards received a deed therefor from said Rose, without any
knowledge on his part of the extension of said demise, and
when, as he is advised, the title of said Rose had ripened into
a complete estate.
The said Lewis Craig was not a terre-tenant, but was entered defendant with Rose on account of his sale to said Rose
of the land in contest.
It was upon the 2d of July, 1827, that Jonathan Rose executed a deed, with special warranty, to Jonathan H. Rose;
and on the 22d of February, 1828, Jonathan Rose and Jonathan
H. Rose united in a deed to Proctor. The kabendumr of the
deed was as follows :"To have and to hold the land hereby conveyed, and the appurtenances, unto the said Proctor, his heirs and assigns, for
ever. The said Jonathan Rose only conveying, without warranty, a life estate which he held by virtue of a lease from said
Jonathan H. Roge; and the said Jonathan H. Rose, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, the aforesaid tract
of land and premises unto the said Proctor, his heirs or assigns,
against the claim or claims of all and every person or persons
whatsoever, .so far as to refund the purchase money without
interest in case said land should be lost by a better claim than
the one thereby conveyed, does and will for ever defend by
these presents."
At the time of the last survey, this tract of land appeared
to have passed into the possession of a person by the name of
Kincaid; by what conveyance the record did not show.
B. The judgment of the Circuit Court with regard to the
tract of land mkrked B was as follows: "It se ms to the court that the heirs of Walden are not entitled to btain, by this proceeding against Blair, the possession
ot. the parcel of land in his posseasion, which is designated in
the report of the surveyor by the figures 15, 14, 6, 6; 11, 15,
and as containing fifteen acres, one rood, and seven poles. It

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

43

Walden et al. v. Badley's Heirs et al.

was purchased, and the possession obtained, from one of the
original complainants in the original bill, but there was no suit
pending for it or against it, and its possession cannot be affected by any subsequent litigation between parties out of its possession. Tilton and Huston purchased it in the year 1813 of
Robert. Pogue, then in the possession, with his title under the
junior patent, for upwards of seven years, and thereupon they
took the possession; since which time it has been held in continued pnssession by them and their vendee, and his vendee,
down to Blair, the defendant, now residing upon it; each and
all holding adverse to Walden. And it seems to the court that
this length of adverse possession, upwards of seven years before the original bill, of which this proceeding is the sequel,
was filed, and upwards of twenty years before Blair, or any
other person in possession, became in any wise a party to the
suit, or to any proceedings in respect to it, does constitute a
bar under the statute of limitations, and that this part of the
case is within the exceptions in the mandate, and the bill and
proceedings of the Waldens, in respect to this part of the land,
are dismissed; and this disposes of all the land for which judgments were recovered in the ejectment suits."
The origin of Blair's title to this piece of land is thus stated
by himself in his answer, in 1837, to the cross-bill, amended
cross-bill, and bill of revivor, filed against him and others by
Walden's heirs.
"This respondent has no personal knowledge whatever of the
progress and movement in the various suits referred to, or of
the derivation of Fitzgerald's title; but he is informed, and
charges, that after the expiration of the demises in said Walden's declaration, and before the renewal thereof, that said
Shockey sold the land in contest to Robert Pogue, who claimed
it previously under the patent in the name of Tibbs, &c., for
ten thousand acres, of land, posterior in date to that of Walden,
and adverse thereto; and said Pogue, who purchased in order
to unite the conflicting claims in himself, then took possession
of said land in contest, and continued the possession in himself
until about the year 1814, when he sold the same to Tilton
and Huston, who then entered and held: the possession for two
or three years, and then sold to Hambrick, who continued in
possession until the demise was entered, and until he sold and
delivered the possession of the same to your respondent."
In April, 1813, Pogue gave a bond of conveyance for this
land to Tilton and Huston. In April, 1816, this bond was assigned to Hambrick, who assigned it to Fitzgerald. About the
year 1829, Pogue gave a deed of it to Fitzgerald, and on the

44

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

20th of September, 1832, Fitzgerald conveyed it to Blair by a
deed, the habendum of which was as follows: "To have and to hold the said tract or parcel of land above
described, together with all and singular the privileges and appurtenances thereunto belonging, or in any wise appertaining to
the same, unto the said Thomas Blair, his heirs and assigns,
for ever, and to their only proper use and benefit and behoof.
And the said Benjamin Fitzgerald, for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, doth hereby covenant to and with
the said Thomas Blair, his heirs, executors, and administrators,
that in case the land hereby conveyed shall be taken or lost by
any better or prior claim, that in that event the said Fitzgerald
will refund to him, the said Thomas Blair, the purchase-money
.thereof, without interest."
C. The judgment of the Circuit Court as to the tract of land
marked C was as follows : "The Waldens have not, however, limited their claim in this
proceeding to the boundaries of the four hundred acres of land
which have been given as the limits of the lands recovered in
the actions of ejectment, but have insisted that these judgments were for all the land within the patent of their ancestors,
for 1,333 acres; and that, whether this position be sustained
or not, they are entitled, on the decree and mandate of the Supreme Court, to have themselves put in possession of all the
land within, and common to, the patent and entry of their ancestor, as established by the decree of this court, to which it is
not shown some other person has the superior title; and they
prayed on the hearing for process by which to have such possession delivered to them. Their prayer is overruled, and this
proceeding dismissed as to Blair, and all the other parties, in
respect to all the lands without the boundary of the land covered by the judgments in ejectment, designated on the plat as
first herein stated.
"Itis, however, provided, that neither these orders, nor what
may be done in consequence of them, hall prejudice the rights
of any of the paities, or their representatives, in the abovementioned actions of ejectment, or in the suit in chancery, of
which this proceeding is a continuation, who are not now
properly before the court. It is ordered that an rccount be
taken of the improvements, and of the rents and profits and
damages, of each of the three above-described parcels of land,
of which, acording to the above opinion, the Waldens are to
have the possession. John C. Herndon is appointed the master for this purpose."
It will be perceived by a reference to the mandate of this

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

45

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

court, which is above recited, that the Circuit Court was instructed "to take such further steps in regard to the improvements, and to the putting of Walden or his representative in
possession of the premises recovered in the ejectment suits, as
shall be conformable to the decree hereby affirmed, and to the
principles of equity."
It is necessary to refer to the ejectment suits to see what
premises were recovered.
The original ejectment, brought in 1797, was in very general terms, for 415 acres of land. After the substitution of
Craig and Chapin as defendants, instead of the casual ejector,
the court ordered a survey of the premises according to the
claim and pretensions of the respective parties. The defendants took defence for all the land included within the locator's
part, as will be seen by the following special case and judgment of the court. The letters A, B, C, D are represented in
the plat in this statement by the figures 7, 8, 9, 10, and the
letters E, F, G, C, by the figures, 1, 2, 3, 9.
"And afterwards, to wit, at the June term of the court aforesaid, to wit, on the 19th day of June, A. D. 1800, the following special case was submitted to the court, by consent of the
parties herein, by their attorneys.
"The tract of land marked on the plat by the letters A, B, C,
D, was duly granted to the said Walden, lessor of the plaintiff,
by patent from the Commonwealth of Virginia bearing date
the 20th day of November, 1786.
"The said Walden and Simon Kenton executed the agreement, marked A, respecting the locating of said lands; the said
agreement is made part of this cause.
"The defendants are in possession of that part of the tract
marked on .the plat by the letters E, F, G, C; and claim the
said part of the said tract of land under the agreement A, and
the indorsement thereon, and a division thereof made as certified by the report B; which report and indorsement on said
agreement is also made a part of this case.
"If, upon the whole, the court shall be of opinion that the
legal title to the said part of the said. tiact of land marked on
the plat as aforesaid by the letters E, G, C, F, is in the plaintiff, then judgment to be entered for him; if not, judgment to
be entered for the defendants.
"WILLIAM CLARK, Attorney for Plaintiff.
Trio.s TODD, Attorney for Defendants.
"And the court, having fully considered and understood the
said case, is of opinion, that the legal title to the said part of

46

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodlefs Heirs et al.

the said tract of land marked on the plat E, F, G, C, is in the
plaintiff, and was on the day of filing the declaration in this
suit.
"It is therefore considered by the court, that the plaintiff recover against the said defendants, Lewis Craig and Amzel
Chapin, his term of and in the premises aforesaid, with the appurtenances, yet to come and unexpired, together with his costs
by him in this behalf expended; and the said defendants in
mercy, &c.
"And-on motion of the plaintiff, by his attorney, the United
States writ of habere facias possessionem is awarded him in
this suit, to cause him to have possession of the terms aforesaid, returnable to the next court."
The judgment in ejeetment in favor of Walden did not
therefore include the tract of land marked C, or any land outside of the locator's part, for which only the defendants took
defence.
Thus far, the claim of the heirs of Walden, and the grounds
of defence of the defendants, have been stated as to those parts
of the tract of land which the Circuit Court refused to give to
Walden's heirs.
It remains now to state the proceedings of that court with
respect to'the parts of the tract which were given to those
heirs, and which are designated upon the preceding plat by the
letters, D, E, and F.
The Circuit Court gave, these lands to Walden's heirs upon
certain conditions, which will be mentioned consecutively, and
from this part of the decree Walden's heirs also appealed.
D. The decree of the Circuit Court was as follows: "It therefore seems to the court that, on this proceeding
against Benjamin Umstead, one of the complainants in the
original bill, the heirs of Walden must have awarded to them
the possession of the parcel of land designated, in the report of
the surveyor filed herein at the present term, by the figures 2,
21, 22, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,2, and as containing one
hundred and forty-nine acres, twenty-eight poles, now in his
possession, when he, Umstead, shall have been paid the amount
which the value of the improvements upon the land exceeds
the rents and profits and damages thereof, or it shall be ascertained that there is no such excess on the account to be
taken. It does not appear that Umstead has had the possession
of any other part of the land since the commencement of these
proceedings; and as to the residue of the land in the proceeding, it is dismissed, without prejudice as to the parcel of land
designated on the plat by figures 21, 3, 22, and 21, containing,

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et aL

according to the surveyor's report, fourteen acres, two roods,
and thirty-six poles, sold by Umstead, as represented in 1813,
and now in the possession of the widow of William Craig."
E. The decree of the Circuit Court with respect to this
piece of land was as follows: " It seems to the court that the Waldens will be entitled, on
the proceedings against the defendant, John N. Proctor, to have
the possession of the land designated on the plat by the figures
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 15, and as containing nineteen acres,
three roods, and twenty-eight poles, in his possession about the
time of the commencement of this proceeding', but now in the
posgession of Jeremiah Wells. Proctor was not a party to the
original bill, but he appears to have purchased this parcel of the
land, and to have acquired the possession of it from Sandridge,
one of the complainants in the original bill, pending the suit;
and when the value of the improvements shall have been paid,
or found compensated by the rents, profits, and damages of the
land, according to an account which will be taken, the Waldens
will be entitled to an order for process of possession. It does
not exactly appear when Wells acquired the possession of this
land; but he is no party, and unless his position be such as to
bind him, he shall not be concluded in respect to any right or
claim he may show in respect to the matter to be effected.?
F. The decree of the Circuit Court with respect to this
piece of land *a0 as follows :,'It seems to the court, that the Waldens will be entitled
against the defendant, Thomas Blair, to have the possession of
the land des ignate'd on the plat by the figures 4, 12, 13, 14, 4,
and as containing fourteen acres, three roods, and eight poles.
It is found in the possession of. Blair, claiming to hold it by
purchase from Pogue, one of the original complainants. He
does not show when he made the purchase, or acquired the
possession, and the fair conclusion is, that he obtained the possession pending the litigation. He must, therefore, surrender
it when he shall have been paid the amount which the value
of the improvements exceeds the rents and profits, with the
damages, on the account which will be taken, or it shall appear
that the result of such account.must be against him."
When this cause was here in 1840, it was held that, as Walden had *been decreed to surrender possession,. and make releases of his elder legal title to complainants for so much of
the land in controversy as their better right in equity covered,
the proper condition imposed on complainants by such decree in
their favor was, that, having received their measure of equity,
they were compellable to do equity to the defendants; and

48

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et aL v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

that therefore they should be constrained to surrender possession to Walden's heirs of that part to which their ancestor had
the better title: and as this had not been ordered by the Circuit Court in the decree made in 1834, (then before us on appeal,) it was so ordered by this court in 1840, as a proper addition to the decree made below; and the cause was sent down
to have our mandate executed in this respect. In attempting
to do so, it is insisted on part of Walden's heirs, that the Circuit Court erred to a material extent, and they have prosecuted
their appeal to this court to correct the errors, and we are now
called on to construe and execute our own mandate; beyond
this, we have no power to go, more than the Circuit Court
had. What that court ought to have done, it is our duty to do.
The mandate directed the Circuit Court "to take such further
steps in regard to the improvements, and to the putting of Walden or his representatives in possession of the premises recovered in the ejectment suits, as shall be conformable to the decjees hereby affirmed, and to the principles of equity."
Beyond the land recovered in the ejectment, we have no
power to act under this mandate; nor to those parts of the
land recovered, which were by the decree of 1834 vested in
complainants and divested out of Walden. It follows, that
the parcel on the plat marked C. 11, 30, 31, 32, 11, is not in
the case now before us, it lying outside of the tract recovered
in the ejectment suit; as to this parcel, the Circuit Court adjudged correctly, when executing the mandate, and therefore
the decree is affirmed in this respect.
The parcel as found on the plat marked A. 1, a, b, 4, 5, 6,
11, 1, next presents itself for our consideration. It was occupied by Kincaid, claiming in some form under -John N. Proctor; and the Circuit Court held that Proctor had acquired the
better title thereto, by force of the act of limitations, which
had- barred Walden's right to recover it; and therefore th,
claim on part of Walden's heirs to have possession thereof surrendered to them was rejected. And the inquiry is, Did
.the statute of limitations operate in Proctor's favor ? Jonathan Rose took possession under Lewis Craig. Rose was
sued in ejectment, and recovered against, in 1800. By some
executory contract, Jonathan Rose sold fo Jonathan H. Rose,
before 1817; and the two Roses seem to have held a joint possession, until they sold to Proctor in 1S26. He took possession in 1827, and the two Roses made him a joint deed iii
1828. In May, 1824, the demise in the ejectment suit was extended to fifty years, commencing. mu1789. The suit then
stood as if the demise had been originally laid for fifty years.

JANUARY TERM, 1850.

49

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

Of this step, neither Jonathan Rose nor Jonathan H. Rose
could legally or justly complain. Proctor came in by purchase
in 1827, and Kincaid afterwards. Then the ejectment suit
was in full force against all these parties. Nor is there any
thing in the fact that Jonathan Rose took a deed from Bodley
and Pogue in 1821, seeking shelter under their inferior title.
And this reduce s the inquiry to the question, whether Proctor
and Kincaid were bound by the proceedings against Jonathan
Rose ? Walden had the legal title and right of possession.
The ejectment suit was pending, and Walden delayed and hindered from obtaining the fruits of his judgment by the acts of
Jonathan Rose; of this pending litigation, purchasers from
Rose were bound to take notice; and they were bound as
alienees, yendente lite, by the proceedings in the suit, after
the alienation, as Jonathan Rose was bound. This is the
general rule. Long v. Morton, 2 A. K. Marshall, 40; Hickman v. Dale, 7 Yerger, 149. And so is the rule in equity
likewise. Story's Eq. Pleading, 287. If it were true, that,
when a recovery was had for land, the party in possessioh,
and from whom the land had been recovered, might sell out
and transfer his possession to another, and the latter could notbe reached by a writ of possession, then there could be no end
to litigation, as the land might be transferred on each successive recovery. And to hold that the alienee might avail himself of the act of limitations, and thereby defeat the action, or
its fruits, by execution, if he and his vendor could, by bills of
injunction, or other unjust contrivance, keep the plaintiff out
for seven years, would equally violate the principle, that he
who buys pendente lite must abide the judgment or decree
against his alienor, regardless of the fact whether such purchaser was or was not a party to the suit.
Up to May, 1839, the judgment in ejectment was in full
force against Proctor, Kincaid, and the Roses; then the demise expired. In 1840, this court ordered that Walden's heirs
should be put into possesgion of the land recovered, because the
legal remedy had ceased. That order proceeded on principles
governing a court of equity; that it was a -ecree in effect
against these parties, for the land above described, is our unanimous opinion; and the Circuit Court having held otherwise,
we direct the decree of that court, in this respect, to be reversed, and order that Walden's heirs be put into possession
of the parcel of land marked A. 1, a, b, 4, 5, 6, 11, 1, on the
plat, of which the one here presented is a copy.
The next parcel claimed by Walden's heirs, to which their
claim was rejected by the Circuit Court. is lot B, marked 15,

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodleys Heirs et aL

14, 5, 6, 11, 15, of 15 acres, 1 rood, and 7 poles, and defended
by Thomas Blair. In tracing title of this tract, a material defect exists in the statement made by the Circuit Court. It
was part of the Hambrick tract, and purchased by Robert
Pogue from Abram Shockey after the recovery in ejectment;
at what precise time, does not appear. Blair alleges in his first
answer, that it was sold, by Walden to A. Chapin, and by
Chapin to Pogue; but in a second answer, Blair alleges that
Pogue purchased of Shockey, and that Shockey was then in
possession; "and that said possession was regularly continued
through Pogue, Tilton and Huston, Hambrick, and Fitzgerald
to your respondent, Blair."
The surveyor's return explains the matter as follows: No. 1. CC15, 14,'5, 6, 11, 15. That part of the Hambrick
tract lying within the locator's part, now in the possession of
Thomas Blair, who holds title under Thomas Fitzgerald by deed
in 1832. Tilton and Huston were contractors with Robert
Pogue for this, and the residue of the Hambrick tract they sold
to Hambrick, and he afterwards to Fitzgerald, who obtained a
conveyance from Pogue about the year 1829. Statement of
Thomas Blair. This part of the Hambrick tract contains 15
acres, 1 rood, and 7 poles, by survey."
No. 2. "11, 30, 31, 32, 11. The balance of the Hambrick
tract in the possession of said Blair outside of the locator, said
to contain 30 acres covered in common by Walden's two surveys."
No. 3. CC4, 12, 13, 14, 4. Represents 14 acres, 3 roods, and
8 poles, within the locator, in the possession of said Blair, held
by purchase from Robert Pogue, who'held under Lewis Chapin.
No title or conveyance has yet passed. Statement of said
Blair. This tract has never" had a regular tenant upon it.
Statement of.Jos. Duncan."
This return stands undisputed, and from it the answer of
Blair may be explained. No. 2 (11, 30, 31, 32, 11),is that
parcel of 30 acres lying outside of the land recovered by the
ejectnent, and with which we have no power to interfere, as
already stated, being lot C on the annexed plat.
No. 3 (4, 12, 13, 14, 4), including 14 acres, 3 roods, and 8
poles, is the land derived through Lewis Chapin by Robert
Pogue; and this tract is not in controversy now.
But No. 1, marked B, for 15 acres, 1 rood, and 7 poles, is
land of which Pogue obtained possession from Abram Shockey;
and Pogu-e was a prin 6 ipal party to the bill of injunction staying the judgment at law. In the ejectment, this latter parcel
B was recovered against Shockey; and when the demise was

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

extended, in 1824, the judgment was in full force against him,
and those holding the possession under him. Thus'the matter stood when Blair purchased and took possession in 1833.
From this time upwards to 1839, Blair was subject to be
evicted by a writ of possession, to which Walden, or his heirs,
had an undoubted right; and to lands thus situate-the mandate
of this court extends, for the reasons already stated,,in regard
to the parcel marked A, and defended by Proctor and Kincaid.
It is therefore ordered, that Walden's heirs be put into possession of the parcel marked B, for 15 acres, 1 rood, and 7 poles;
and that the decree of the Circuit Court in regard thereto be
reversed.
And as respects all other parts of the decrees and orders
made by the Circuit Court, in execution of our mandate, we
hold the same to have been proper, in so far as such decrees
and orders awarded possession to Walden's heirs, or rejected
their claim to have possession; -and said decrees and orders are
hereby affirmed, with the modification hereafter stated, as respects the putting of Walden's heirs into immediate possession;
and also as respects the mode of proceeding to recover rents
and profits, or for value of improvements.
And it is further ordered, that this cause be remanded to the
Circuit Court, with directions that Walden's heirs and representatives be put into the possession of all the. parcels of land
awarded to them under the mandate, either by the Circuit
Court or by this court, on or before the 1st of January next;
and it is further ordered, that such possession shall be delivered
to Walden's heirs or representatives, regardless of the fact
whether claim; for improvements or for mesne profits exist
on the one side or the other*; the intention of this court being
to give possession to Walden's heirs and representatives in the
same manner that a writ of habere facias possessionem would
do -when executed, so that they may have the benefit and advantages of their judgment at law.
And it is further ordered, that any party on whom this decree operates, who claims compensation fof improvements made
on the land, or on any parcel thereof, may file his petition before said Circuit Court, setting forth his claim to compensation
for such improvements-, and that said heirs or representatives
of Walden may answer the same, and be allowed to set off'
mesne profits arising because of the possession of the parcel of
land on which said improvements are alleged to have been
made; and that, in deciding on such controversy, said Circuit
Court shall be governed by the rules appertaining to a court
of equity in such like cases.

SUPREME COURT.
Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et a].

And it is further ordered, that the heirs and representatives
of Walden shall have the corresponding right to file their petition against any claimant holding possession, and who has
been a party to this proceeding, or who may hold under such
party by transfer of title made since the date of the mandate
of this court, for any rents and profits that can be equitably
claimed for the occupancy and use of said respective parcels of
land; and to adjudge and decree among the respective parties
as equity may demand. Nor shall cross petitions for value of
improvements, and for mesne profits on the other hand, be required ; but the court may hear the whole matter on petition
and answer, and decree for either side for any balance, after
one demand is set off, in part, against the other, on an account
stated.
And it is further ordered, that the appeal brought here by
said Walden's heirs, to reverse the decree dismissing the crossbill filed, 25th November, 1834, by Ambrose Walden, and the
amendments and other proceedings in said cross-bill, and which
are found in record No. 96 of this court, be dismissed; and that
the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing the same be, and the
same is hereby, affirmed; and that the appellants, the heirs of
Walden, pay the costs of said appeal.
And it is further ordered, that the appellees, John .N. Proctor and Thomas Blair, against whom decrees for lots A and B
have been made, and who are the principal appellees, pay the
costs of the appeal on record No. 95 of this court, containing
the proceedings had before the Circuit Court when executing
our mandate of 1840, and that said Proctor and Blair pay said
costs by moieties; that is, one half thereof each.
And as respects the parcel marked D on the plat tvcompanying this decree, being for forty-nine acres andi twenty-eight
poles, defended by Benjamin Umstead in the Circuit Court,
and which said court adjudged should be surrendered to Walden's heirs, it is ordered and decreed, that said parcel be delivered to Walden's heirs by said Umstead on or before the
1st of January next. And that in other respects said decree
against Umstead be affirmed, except that in proceeding for
improvements he shall be governed by the rules that other de.
fendants are.
And as respects the parcel of fourteen acres, two roods, and
thirty-six poles, represented to be in the possession of the
widowr of William Craig, and designated on the plat by the
figures 21, 3, 22, and 21, it is ordered and adjudged that all
further proceeding under the mandate shall be barred, and no
further steps be allowed as to said parcel, because said widow

53

Walden et al. v. Bodley's Heirs et al.

of William Craig has in no wise been made a party to the proceeding, and it is now too late to bring her before the court.
And as respects the parcel marked E on the plat, containing
nineteen acres, three roods, and twenty-eight poles, designated
by the figures 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 15, defended by John
N. Proctor, and which was adjudged by the Circuit Court to
be by him surrendered to Walden's heirs, it is ordered that said
parcel shall be surrendered accordingly on or before the first
day of January next, and that in this respect said decree is
deemed to be conclusive against Jeremiah Wells and all others
claiming under Proctor; and that, therefore, so much of said
decree as leaves the controversy open to let in Jeremiah Wells
further to litigate be, and the same is hereby, reversed.. Reserving, however, to said Wells the right to come forward, if
he has any interest or claim for the value of improvements, in
the same manner that said Proctor might do, according to the
principles and in the mode above prescribed. This decree is
founded on the fact that Proctor appears to be the owner, and
he defended before the Circuit Court; and nothing appears in
the record to show that Wells has any claim to the land, nor
that he had been in possession for such length of time as to bar
Walden's right to demand possession from him.
And as respects the parcel F on the plat, of fourteen acres,
three roods, and eight poles, designated by the figures 4, 12,
13, 14, 4, defended by Thomas Blair, and which the Circuit
Court ordered him to surrender to Walden's heirs, it is ordered
and decreed that said parcel be surrendered to the heirs of
Walden on or before the 1st of January next; and that so
much of said decree as allows said Blair to retain possession
until the" value of improvements, &c., be taken, be, and the
same is hereby, reversed. But that said Blair shall be allowed
to file his petition, and to seek payment for his improvements,
on the general principles above stated. And. on petitions being
filed for the value of improvements, .service of notice on the
counsel of Walden's heirs shall be sufficient service.
And as to all matters respecting the payment of costs, not
disposed of in the Circuit Court, it is ordered that said court
proceed to take cognizance thereof, and make decrees and orders therein.
Order. No. 96.

Order. No. 95.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Kentucky, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it appears to this court that that part of the decree of the said Circuit Court, in the case between Thomas
Bodley's heirs, Robert Pogue's heirs, and others, complainants,
and Ambrose Walden's heirs, defendants, on a mandate from
this court that the -heirs of Ambrose Walden were not entitled
to obtain, in the proceeding against John N. Proctor, the possession of the parcel of land-designated on the plat of the survey
by the letters and figures 1, a, b, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 1, is erroneous and should be reversed; And also, that that part of said
decree, that the said heirs of Walden were not entitled to obtain in the proceeding against Thomas Blair the possession of.
the parcel of land in his possession, designated in the report of
the surveyor by the figures 15, 14, 5, 6, 11, and 15, containing fifteen acres, one rood, and seven poles, is erroneous, and
should be reversed; and that the residue of the said decree
should be affirmed, with the modifications stated in the opinion
of this court, in this case, at this term. Whereupon, it is now
here ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this court, that the decree of the said Circuit Court in this cause, for the errors aforesaid, apd to the extent thereof, be, and the same is hereby,
reversed and annulled; that the heirs of Ambrose Walden
recover a moiety, or one half, of their costs, on this appeal in
this court, of and from the said John N. Proctor, and the other
moiety, or half; of and from the said Thomas Blair, and that
they .have executions against them severally therefor; and that
this cause be, and the same is hereby, remanded to the said
Circuit Court, with directions to that court to carry into effect
the opinion of this Court (hereto annexed, and made part of
this mandate), and for such further proceedings to be- had
herein as may be in conformity to this opinion, and as to law
and justice may appertain.
