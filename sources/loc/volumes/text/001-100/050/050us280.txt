SUPREME COURT.
Daris v. The Police Jury of Coneordia.

SAMUEL DAvis, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,

v.

THE POLICE JURY OF THE

PARISH OF CONCOrDIA.
The treaty of St. Ildefonso, by which Spain ceded Louisiana to France, became
operative to transfer the sovereignty upon the day of its date, viz. the 1st of October, 1800.
The executive and legislative branches of the government of the United States have
always maintained this position, and this court concurs with them in its correctness.
The preceding case, p. 127, of The United States v. Reynes referred to.
By the laws of nations, all treaties, as well those for cessions of territory as for other
purposes, are binding upon the contracting parties, unless when otherwise provided
in them, from the day they are signed. The ratification of them relates back to
the time of signing.
"Where territory is ceded, the national character continues for commercial purposes,
until actual delivery; but between the time of signing the treaty and the actual
delivery of the territory, the sovereignty of the ceding power jeases, except for
strictly municipal purposes, or such an exercise of it as is necessary to preserve
and enforce the sanctions of its soial condition.
The power to grant land or franchises is one of those attributes of sovereignty which
ceases.
The Spanish Governor of Louisiana had, therefore, no right to grant a perpetual
ferry fianchise on the 19th of February, 1801 ; and, consequently, it is not property which was protected by the treaty between France and the United States.

THIS case was brought up from the Supreme Court of the
State of Louisiana, by a writ of error issued under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act.
As the decision of the court turned upon the single point
when the treaty of St. Ildefonso became operative, so far as
to extinguish the right of the Spanish governor to grant a
perpetual franchise, it is not necessary to give a detailed statement of the facts in this case, nor of the arguments of counsel
upon the points which were not included in the decision of the
court.
The .following summary will sufficiently explain the case.
Davis, the plaintiff in error, filed his petition in the Ninth
District Court of the State of Louisiana, in and for the Parish
of Concordia, on the 7th of February, 1840, in which he sets
fotth, that the Marquis de Casa Calva, then Governor-General
of the Province of Louisiana, on the 19th of February, 1801,
granted to one Thomas Thompson, then of said parish, the
privilege of a ferry at the post of Concordia, in said parish, opposite to the then town, now city, of Natchez, as a privilege to
be attached to the plantation of said Thompson, which he 'then
possessed, in order that from that place he might have and enjoy the exclusive privilege, &c., for reasonable and customary
toll, as it might be established; and on condition that he, the
said Thompson, would clear a certain public road or highway
from the said post of Concordia to the Bayou Cocadelle (Coco-

drillo), in said parish. That Thompson fully performed the
said conditioni, as appears by the certificate of Joseph Vidal, the
commandant at said post of Concordia. That Thompson entered upon the privilege aforesaid, and performed the duties,
and enjoyed the profits of said ferry, until the 16th of October,
1803, when he conveyed to Joseph Vidal all his right, title, and
interest in and to said ferry and said tract of land. That the
tract of land to which the privilege was attached was sold by
ThompsQn to Vidal for the sum of four thousand dollars I when
the land without the ferry would not at the time have been
worth more than eight hundred dollars. That said Vidal entered into possession of said ferry and plantation, and continued
to keep and enjoy the same until the year 1817, when he sold
and delivered the same to petitioner. That petitioner thus became the owner of the said tract of land, and the lawful proprietor of the exclusive privilege of keeping said ferry. That
by the laws, usages, and customs of the Spanish governmentat the date of said grant, said grant operates to the exclusion
of any other ferry, for the distance of one league above and one
league below. That the title of petitioner, acquired from the
Spanish government, has also a prescriptive right, founded on
the possession and enjoyment thereof by himself and vendors
since 1801.
The petitioner then set forth that the Police Jury of the
Parish of Concordia, in April, 1839, established a ferry across
the Mississippi, from the town of Vidalia, in the parish of
Concordia, to the city of Natchez, which conflicted with his
right.
The answer admitted the establishment of the ferry by the
Police Jury, averred their right to do so, and contested the
plaintiff's claim upon grounds which it is not necessary here to
mention. Evidence was taken on both sides.
On the 14th of June, 1841, the Ninth District Court gave
judgment for the defendants.
The case was carried to the Supreme Court of Louisiana,
which, at October term, 1841, reversed the judgment of the
District Court, upon matters of evidence. It is reported in 19
Louisiana Reports, 533.
Upon the second hearing before the Ninth District Court,
judgment was' rendered for the petitioner Davis, which, upon
being again carried to the Supreme Court, was again reversed,
and judgment rendered for the defendants. This last case is
reported in 1 Louis. Ann. Rep. 288.
The petitioner, Davis, sued out a writ of error, and brought
the case up to this court.

SUPREME COURT.
Davis v. The Police Jury of Concordia.

It was argued by Mr. Coxe and Mr. Gilpin, for the plaintiff
in error, and Mr. Jones, for the defendant in error.

The counsel for the plaintiff in error contended, 1. The plaintiff contends that the grant under which he
claims originated in a contract by which the exclusive privilege of keeping a ferry in front of his plantation was given to
Thomas Thompson, in consideration for making a road, which
he did make.
2. That the words con exclusion, in the grant, mean that
the sovereign or -his agents shall not establish another ferry
"ithin a reasonable distance of his own.
3. That the ferry attempted to be established at Vidalia by
the defendant is on the same line of travel, and in the immediAte vicinity of his grant; and, if it goes into operation, the
obligation of the contract which he holds will be impaired, and
his benefit greatly diminished, contrary to the true intent and
meaning of the grant.
Recognizing the supervising authority- of this court, and
yielding to the supposed expositior. of law by this tribunal, the
Supreme Court of Louisiana decided that the words con exclusion were susceptible of an interpretation different from that
given to them by complainant's counsel; and therefore it was
incumbent, on that court to give to that expression this narrow
and restricted meaning. On the part of the plaintiff in error, it
will be contended th t this court erred.
This case, on the same pleadings, has been twice before the
Supreme Court of Louisiana; on the first occasion, reported in
19 Louisiana- 533, it cam e up on bill of exception taken on the
trial on sundry rulings of the District Court as to the admission
or rejection of testimony. The plaintiff's title was, however,
then. exhibited, as it now is, and sustained by the same documentary evidence which is now produced. The validity of
this title was then denied by defendant, as it now is, and was
then at issue. Yet, throuihout the entire argument of counsel, and the opinion of the court, no doubt is breathed as to the
extent of the privilege embraced in the grant. The cause was
remanded, with instructions to the District Court as to the
competency of testimony alone.
. On the second trial, the District Court did conform to these
directions, and a verdict was renddred for the plaintiff.
On a second appeal to the Supreme Court, every point which
was decided in the District 'Court directly was affirmed; but a
new point was gratuitously taken by that court, on which its.
decision was adverse to plaintiff; and this point is that which

is alone presented on this'writ of error. -1 Louisiana Ann. Rep.
288-292.
The Louisiana court appeared to think this case closed, by
the Charles River Bridge case, in 11 Peters, 423, and understood it as asserting, C1 that, if any other meaning can be given
to a grant besides that which would surrender for ever a franchise, and a part o f the sovereign power, that meaning must be
preferred." We contend that the language and, meaning of
this court in the case cited have been misunderstood; and that
no such doctrine ought to govern the present case.
We shall further contend, 1. That the mere grant of a ferry privilege across the Mississippi, by competent authority, implies, ex vi termini, an exclusion of all other ferry rights, not only by private unlicensed individuals, but operates to exclude the sovereign from making a
similar grant, or one which will conflict with it, and impair or
destroy its value to another.
2. That the grant in this case, con exclusion, is such an express recognition of such exclusive right.
3. That this is a case of express contract, by which, for a
valuable consideration, Thompson became the purchaser of an
exclusive ferry privilege.
4. That the uninteriupted and uncontested right thus
claimed, having been exercised and enjoyed by himself, and
those under whom he claims title, for a period of thirty-eight
years, furnished the most conclusive evidence of title against
defendauts.
The authorities relied upon to sustain these positions are
those referred to in the cases already cited from the Louisiana
Reports, and 11 Peters; with the opinion of this court, pronounced -during the present term, in the Ilinois Ferry case. confirming the views here taken of the Charles River Bridge

SUPREME COURT.
Davis v. The Police Jury of Concordia.

The second point made by M'r. Jones, for the defendant in
error, was as follows II. The grant in question, whatever the nature or extent of
the interest intended to be conveyed by it, never, for an'instant,
had any validity, as against the United States or the State of
Louisiana.
1st. Because it was not one of those complete and consummate grants, the validity, force, and effect of- which were left
by Congress to be determined by the general principles and
rules of international law, but was executory in its nature, as
being dependent, for its consummate force and effect, upon the
performance of a condition by the grantee, and therefore within
the purview of the laws of the United States making it necess ry for all but consummate grants to pass through the regular
process to confirmation by Congress, or to adjudication under
the authority of Congress. (Laws of United States and judgments of this court in execution of them, hereinafter cited to
other points, and passim.)
2d. Because the treaty of St. Ildefonso, as between the parties to it, operated from its date; and instantly transferred to
France all the rights of municipal sovereignty and eminent
domain then appertaining to the territorial sovereign; which
Spain 'was bound to transmit undiminished and intact to
France. During the time that Spain occupied the province,
between the date of the treaty (1st October, 1800) and the delivery of the province over to France (30th November, 1803),
the possession and the dominion, remaining with her, were
held in trust for France. The authority resulting from such
possession and dominion was limited to the ordinary acts of
local administration, the preservation of order and the due
execution of the laws, and extended not even to the granting
away of royal demesnes or crown lands, far less to the irrevocable alienation of any portion of the eminent domain, or to
the diminution of any of the rights of ultimate sovereignty
tfien enjoyed by the territorial sovereign.
Even the United States are held to have taken the dominion
of all the territories ceded to them, including whate- er was
ceded either by particular States or by France, under a strict
trust for the new States intended to be carved out of si ch territories; and, as such trustees, bound to transmit all the rights
of municipal sovereignty and eminent domain unimpaired to
the new States; and were therefore incompetent to grant away
from the new States any navigable waters, or the soils under
them, or the shores, or, in short, any land below the ordinary
high-water mark. Pollard v. Hogan, 3 How. 221 et seg.

JANTtARY TERM. 1850.

285

Davis v. The Police Jury of Conco dia.

But all question of the disabling effect of the treaty of- St.
Ildefonso, fromf its date, upon Spanish authority to grant, or in
any way to diminish, either the crown lands or any rights of
territorial sovereignty, was completely clrsed in three months
after the delivery of Louisiana to the Unitd States, by anact
of Congress positively repudiating all Spanish grants made after the 1st of October, 1800, with an exception of actual settlers before that date; and this court, conforming to the rule
so repeatedly laid down in its own adjudications, which binds
the 'judicial department to follow the lead of the political department of the government in the practical construction, assertion, and execution of all such national rights as are acquired,
and of all such national obligations as are incurred, by treaty
stipulation, has repeatedly adjudged Spanish grants to be void,
because made after that date. Act of Congress, 26th March,
1804, erecting Louisiana into two territories, 2 Stat. at Large,
283; Foster and Ejam v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253; Garcia v; Lee,.
12 Pet. 515; Pollard v. Kibbe, 14 Pet. 63.
If, therefore, the grant now in question be taken as going to
vest a perpetual and irrevocable franchise in the grantee, it
bound neitler France nor the United States. The utmost extent of jurisdiction then remaining in any Spanish authority
over ferries, was to license and regulate them; so as that the
term of no license should go beyond the duration of the temporary possession and dominion held by Spain.
Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
There is enough upon the record of this case to give this'
court jurisdiction, but not enough to give the appellant the relief for which he has brought it here.
His complaint is, that the application of the law of Louisiana
for the establishment of ferries (2 Mart. Dig. 142, 3 Mart. Dig.
292) to a ferry franchise claimed by him, from Concordia to
Natchez, is an invasion upon a right of property secured by the
third article of the treaty between the United States and the
Republic of France, ceding Louisiana to the former; and that
it impairs the obligation of a contract, which was entered into
between the Marquis de Casa Calvo and one Thomas Thompson,
on the 19th of February, 1801, granting to Thompson a ferry
at the post of Concordia to Natchez, as a privilege to be attached
to his plantation, on condition that Thompson would clear a
public road from Concordia to the Bayou Cocodrillo. The appellant claims the franchise and land to which it was attached,
as a purchaser of both from Joseph Vidal, who bought from
Thompson the grantee, on the 16th of October, 1803. It is

further said, that by the law, usages, and cistoms of Spain, it,
Louisiana, at the date of the gxant, no other ferry could be established within a league above or below its locality. The
interference with the franchise is said to be the establishment
of another ferry by the Police Jury -of Concordia, from the town
of Vidalia, in that .arish, to the city of Natchez. The validity
of this proceeding is called in question, on the ground, as we
have already said, of its being contrary to a treaty and the
Constitution of the United.States. Both having been decided
by the highest court in Louisiana against the rights claimed,
the cause is before us, under the provisions of the twenty-fifth
section
of the Judiciary Act.of 1789..
In support
of the appellant's case; his counsel urge, 1st.
That the grant of a ferry privilege across the Mississippi, by
competent authority, implies, ex vi termini, an exclusion
of all other ferry rights, not only by private, unlicensed individuals, but operates to exclude the sovereign from making'a
similar grant to another, which will conflict with it, or impair
or destroy its value. 2d. That the grant in this case, con exclusion, is an express recognition of such exclusive right. 3d.
That this is a case of express contract, by which, for a valuable
consideration, Thompson became a purchaser of an exclusive
ferry privilege. 4th. That the-uninterrupted right thus claimed,
having been exercised and enjoyed by the appellant, and those
under whom hb claims, for thirty-eight years, is conclusive evidence of title against the defendants.
We have placed the point in the case upon which the jurisdiction of this court attaches in near connection with the points
just read, to show that three of them are not regxaminable by
this court, however they may have been adjudicated by the
court below,
I The first, second, and fourth points involve questions of what
the sovereign may do, or not do, in granting a second ferry
franchise which impairs the value of one previously granted;
also, whether the words con exclusion, in thT grant to Thompson, mean an exclusive and perpetual ferry franchise ; and,
lastly, whether its long use by Thompson and those claiming
from him is, or is not, conclusive proof of the franchise, and
that they.may claim it prescriptively. All of these are questions depending upon the provincial laws of Louisiana, when
-belonging either to France or Spain; upon its territorial law
afterwards, when, it became a part of the United States; and
upon such laws as may have been passed and continue to be in
force in the State of Louisiana. ,Neither of them involves the
validity of z treaty or statute of, nor an authority exercised

under, the United States; nor the validity of a statute or an
authority exercised under a State, on the ground of being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United
States; nor do they, or either of them, draw in question the
construction of any clause of the Constitution, or of a treaty or,
statute of, or commission held under, the United States.
What we have to decide in this case is, whether or not the
franchise of a ferry given *by the Marquis de Casa Calvo to
Thompson is a property protected by the treaty by 'which
Louisiana was ceded to the United States, or a contract bought
by Thompson for a valuable consideration, which has been impaired by the action of the Police Jury of Concordia, under the
laws of Louisiana.
Now, in our view of the case, it matters not what merits
Thompson may have had in getting his privilege of a ferry;
whether he made, or did not make, the road from the post of
Concordia to Cocodrillo; or how long he and those claiming
under him have had the use of the privilege; or what were the
powers of the Governor of Louisiana to grant such a franchise,
or to what extent other officers, acting temporarily as governors,
could exercise the powers of sovereignty, delegated to one who
was so by commission; or what were the usages in Louisiana,
before it was ceded to the United States, in respect to ferry
raits and the use of them, -if the sovereignty of Spain in
ouisiana had been parted with when the Marquis de Casa
Calvo gave this ferry right to Thompson. Had the Marquis,
at the time it was done, supposing him to have been exercising the plenary power of a Governor of Louisiana, any
official faculty to delegate to a subject of the king of Spain,
as a franchise, a portion of the king's royal privilege or prrogative ?
The contract must be tested, as all others are, whether they
are national or private, by the competency of the parties to
make it. If that does not exist, nothing can be claimed under
it,'except such equities as may have arisen to either from the
conduct of one or the other of them in the transaction.
The transaction in this case is, that the Marquis de Casa
Calvo, Governor-General of the Province of Louisiana, granted,
to one Thomas Thompson, on the 19th of February, 1801, a
*ferry at the post of Con cordia, opposite to the town of Natchez,
as a privilege to be attached to the plantation he possessed, "in
order that from that place,, with exclusive privilege, he may
carry on the ferry across the river, demanding and receiving
only the prices most equitable and customary which may be
established with the accord of the commandant of the post of

Concordia,"- "que se fixavan con acuerdo del dicho cornmandante."
Four months before this privilege was given to Thompson,
on the 1st of October, 1800, the treaty of St. Ildefonso was
made, by which Spain retroceded to France the Province of
Louisiana. The terms and conditions of that treaty we will
speak of presently, as far as it may be necessary to do so, after
we have shown the views taken by the different departments
of the government of the United States of the obligations of it,
when they began, and when the full sovereignty of Spain
ceased over Louisiana.
Each of them has said officially, that the sovereignty of the
king of Spain for granting lands in Louisiana ceased with the
signatures of the treaty of St. Ildefonso, on the 1st of October,
1800. Within a year after the cession of Louisiana, Congress,
having learned that concessions for lands had been made by the
Governors of Louisiana, between the 1st of October, 1800, and
the 30th of April, 1803, the date of our treaty with France,
passed an act declaring all such concessions void, and of no
effect in law or equity.
This act was passed coincidently with what had been the
declaration of the executive department of the government.
This court has said the same in several cases. In the case of
the United States v. Joseph Reynes, decided at this term, it has
been reaffirmed, with a mbre extended examination than had
been made before of the treaty of St. Ildefonso, that also between the French Republic and the king of Spain, signed in
Madrid on the 21st of March, 1801, with the order of Barcelona
for the delivery of Louisiana to France in execution of both
treaties, and of the treaty between France and the United States
in connection with the actual delivery of the Province to the
United States, on the 20th of December, 1803, by Laussat, the
commissioner of the French government appointed for that purpose. The treaty of St. Ildefonso may be found in 2 White's
New Rec. 516; that of Madrid of the 21st-of March, 1801, in
2 Martin's Treaties Sup. 329, and in 2 White, 501 ; the royal
order given at Barcelona, and the proceeding thereon, in 2
White's Recop., from 190 to 196 inclusive; the treaty between
France and the United States, 2 White's Recop. 196 ; and the
act of delivery by France to the United States, 2 White's Recop., from 225 to 228 inclusive.
In Reynes's case, the judgment of the District Court affirm.
ing his grant was reversed, on the ground that the treaty between France and the United States gave to the latter all the
rights acquired byi Franice by the treaty of St. Ildefouiso, and

JANUARY

Davis v. The Police Jury of Concordia.

that the political sovereignty of the king of Spain in Louisiana
to grant lands ceased with the date of it, on the 1st of October,
1800.
We will now show, that the decision in that case accords
with the received usages of nations in respect to rights acquired
under treaties; that it is sustained by all that we now know
of what were the relations between France and Spain at the
time of the event, and the motives of the two governments for
entering into the treaty of St. Ildefonso.
All treaties, as well those for cessions of territory as for other
purposes, are binding upon the contracting parties, unless when
otherwise provided in them, from the day they are signed.
The ratification of them relates back to the time of signing.
Yattel, B. 4, c. 2, see. 22; Mart. Summary, B. 8, c. 7, see. 5.
It is true, that, in a treaty for the cession of territory, its
national character continues, for all commercial purposes; but
full sovereignty, for the exercise of it, does not pass to the nation to which it is transferred until actual delivery. But it is
also true, that the exercise of sovereignty by the ceding country ceases, except for strictly municipal purposes, especially for
granting lands. 'And for the same reason in both cases ; - because, after the treaty is made, there is not in either the union
of possession and the right to the territory which must concur
to give plenum dominium ei utile. To give that, there must
be the jus in rem and the jus in re, or what is called in the
common law of England the juris et seisince conjunctio. "This
general law of property applies to the right of territory no less
than to other rights, and all writers upon the law of nations
concur, that the practice and conventional law of nations have
been conformable to this principle," Puffendorf par Barbeyrac,
lib. 4, c. 9, sec. 8, note 2.
In this case, after the treaty was made, and until Louisiana
was delivered to France, its possession continued in Spain.The right to the territory, though in France, was imperfect
until ratified, but absolute by ratification from the date of the
treaty. Such was the manifest intention, from the promise and
engagement of his Catholic Majesty, ia-te third article of the
treaty ; -conditional upon the execution of the stipulations of
the treaty relative to the Duke of Parma; but becoming retro-.
actively absolute from the tinie of the signature of the treaty,
as soon as these conditions were performed, or when others for
the same end were substituted by thb contracting parties.
The disability of Prance, or her refusal to perform the conditions for which the retrocession was to be made, would have
released the king ofSpain from his p romise and engagement to

make it. It may also be, that the conditions were to be performed by France in the time mentioned in the first article,
and that Spain was to keep possession of the territory as a security for that performance. But in either case, our conclusions
that the rights of France attached, and that the sovereignty of
Spain ceased from the signature of the treaty, would not be
weakened; as the Republic of France and his Catholic Majesty
entered into another treaty on the 21st of March, 1801, to-determine in a positive manner what states were to be given to
the infant Duke of Parma, as an equivalent for the Duchy of
Parma. In which it is also declared, that this second treaty
had its origin in that in which the king cedes to France the
possession of Louisianar. And further, that the contracting
parties agree to carry into effect the articles of that treaty, and
that, while the difficulties with regard to them are in process of
arrangement, the present treaty shall not destroy the rights of
either party under the first treaty. And if, as has been said,
possession was meant to be held by Spain, as a security for the
fulfilment of the treaty by France, until the time when the delivery was to be made, that purpose must be considered as exclusive of any larger intent. The order given by Spain for the delivery of the territory to France precludes all inquiry about the
performance of the stipulations of the treaties by either of the
contracting parties. Its terms, as is said in Reynes's case, acknowledge that the right of France to the territory ceded was
complete, and that the sovereignty of Spain over it ceased with
the signature of the treaty of St. Ildefonso.
This view of the subject is confirmed by the subsequent
conduct of Spain. When her relations with France had become less amicable than they had been, and it was rumored
that France was negotiating a sale of Louisiana to the United
States. the Secretary of State of Spain, Don Pedro Cevallos,
wrote to our Minister, Mr. Charles Pinckney, remonstrating
against the proceedings of France in disposing of Louisiana.
He declared, also, if the United States bought it, that it would
be an absolute nullitkr, as France had formally and positively
engaged not to sell it. No other complaint was then or afterwards made in respect to the right of France to Louisiana, or
when those rights began. 2 White's Recop. 546. Of course,
as 'there was nothing of the kind in the treaty, the remonstrance was disregarded, and the purchase was made.
There will be found also, in the order given for the delivery
of Louisiana to France, a further confirmation that the king
of Spain had not his former sovereignty over it after the treaty
of St. Ildefonso was signed, and that his ministers did not th.ink
he had in the interval until the delivery was made.

JA14UARY TERM, 1850.

291

DaTis v. The Police Juiy of Concordia.

The order-does not vary, except as to the thing to be done,
from the usual formula -for sucl" a' purpose. It is in fact a copy
of the order which-was given by France when Louisiana was
ceded to Spain in 1762. That had' bepn preceded by others
like it for more than- a hundred years, when the monarchs of
Europe ceded to each other by treaty distant territories, either
in India or America. This which we are now considering
must have the same meaning which international usages have
uniformly given to the whole of them.
There is always, in such an order, a commendation of the
inhabitants, their interests generally, and of their possessions or
property, perfect and inchoate, to the kind consideration of
their new monarch, in the sense in which, presumptively,, they
would have been treated by the ceding sovereign. The JlAnguage of it is hope, - not right, or the assertion of power. If
it was not so, the order for delivery might impose larger obligations upon the nation who receives the territory than the treaty
does. The relations as to the value and suitableness bf the ceded territory for the purposes of colonization might be changed.
Instead of having lands for gratuitous distribution to new colonists, or upon such terms of purchase as the policy of a n~w
sovereign might make desiralde, that policy might be controlled
by grants after the treaty for a cession has been signed.. Indeed,
before the signature of a treaty, but after negotiations have begun for a cession of territory, grants of land canfiot be made in
it without being subject to confirmation by the -sovereign to
whom the transfer shall be made. The inceptive equity of
grants made by the governors of remote territories, who do not
know that i cession of it has been made, or that negotiations
have been begun for such an end, may be recommended to the
kind consideration of the sovereign who receives the transfer;
but no more can be claimed. When, then, the king of Spain
gave his order at Barcelona for the delivery of Louisiana to
France, and said, in royal terms, "meanwhile we hope" that
all grants of property, of whatsoever denomination, made by
my governors may be confirmed, although not confirmed by
myself, he admits that he had not the sovereignty to confirm
them; that hehJad no power to do then what he might have
done before the treaty, and what he ought fo have done if he
had power afterwards to confirm them, - that which, in fairness
to his former subjects and to his own honor, it may be presumed
he would' have done, but from being conscious that the power
to confirm such grants had been transferred to France. Such
orders for the delivery of ceded territories, though usual, are
not always given, whether there is or is not a provision in lhe

treaty for it to be done, Without them, however, treaties
could not be consummated in already settled territories, with a
due regard to the respective right§ of the contracting parties, or
with the peaceable transference meant by them. They prevent
violence, are the best proof of a change of national character,
preserve the commercial rights of the inhabitants, give to
them in the eyes of all the world the new rights and relations
they may have acquired, and establish, in the most notorious
way it can be done, that the ceded territory has become a part
of another dominion, partaking with it all those relations which
nations can have with each other in commerce, in peace, and
in war,
Sir William Scott,.in his opinion in the case of the Fama, 5
Robinson's Admiralty Reports, - given as early as February,
1804, upon the treaty of St. Ildefonso, retroceding Louisiana
to France, (though the reporter cites it as of the date of the
previous treaty of St. Ildefonso of 1796,)- coincides with our
views respecting sovereignty over a ceded territory, and the
commercial character, in which a people of a distant settlement
are placed, by a treaty of the state to which they belong, and
by which they are stipulated to be transferred to another
power, before the delivery of the territory has been made. The Fama sailed from New Orleans in April, 1803, for
Havre de Grace, with Spanish property on board. She was
taken on the way by a British cruiser, and her cargo libelled, it
being alleged to be enemy's or French property only upon the
ground that Louisiana had been ceded by Spain to France before the Fama sailed. The points stated in the words of Sir
William Scott are, whether the treaty did not in itself confer
full sovereignty and right of dominion to France, and whether
the inhabitants were not so ceded by that treaty as to become
immediacely French subjects. The cause was fully argued on
both sides by as able counsel as were in that day or since in the
admiralty courts of England. The cargo was restored to the
Spanish claimant, on the ground that the national character of a
place agreed to be suirendered by treaty, but not actually delivered, continues as it was under the character of the ceding
country.
He cites, in support of his conclusion, the treaty signed at
Breda, on the 21st of July, 1667, between Louis the Fourteenth
and Charles the Sec'ond, in which Nova Scotia was ceded to
France; and the treaty of 1762, by which Louisiana was
ceded by France to Spain. He might have found in the proceedings under the first, before the order for delivery was
given, a confirmation of his conclusion, in the orders and

passes which were given to merchant ships before the treaty
was ratified. Such passes were given to renew at once the navigation and commerce provided for in the fourth article of that
treaty, and that French vessels might trade with Nova Scotia
as a dominion of France before it was surrendered. His whole
argument, too, for his conclusion shows that, when he says,
" until a delivery has been made, the former sovereignty must
remain," he did not mean sovereignty in the sense of the supreme power to govern and to dispose of the lands in a ceded
territory, or for the exercise 'of any sovereign power in it
other than that sovereignty which was necessary to preserve
and enforce the sanctions of its social condition, and which
would protect its inhabitants in all of their existing national relations, conventional or otherwise, whatever they rfight be, until
.they were actually surrendered.
When delivery has been
made, these relations cease for the future from the time it has
been done, and those of the nation receiving 'the territory begin. That such was the extent and limait of Sir William
Scott's use of the words "'sovereignty must remain," is clear
from the concluding words upon that point in the case. They
are, -- " I am of opinion, therefore, that on all the several
groinds of reason or practice and judicial recognition, until possession was actually taken, the inhabitans of New Orleans continued under the former sovereignty of Spain." And when previously speaking of what passes full sovereignty in territory acquired by treaty, his test of union 'f possession and right to
constitute full sovereignty excludes the idea of its entire continuance in a government which, having had both, had parted
with its ril1hd to another, with a concomitant obligation to deliver the possession. In fact, the full sovereignty in such a
case is not in one or the other of the contracting parties, but in
both, for either to do whatever is essential to the preservation
of the ability of each to consummate their contract, according
to its terms.
Of course, what we have just sdid respecting sovereignty in
cessions of territory is meant to be understood of treaties
signed by plenipotentiaries having full powers to do so, and
which have been afterwards ratified; and not bf those conventions entered into and signed conditionally sub sPe rati, by a
minister not furnished with orders to execute it absolutely.
Such was the treaty of Fontainebleau" executed on the 3d of
November, 1762, for the cession of Louisiana to Spain, which
is cited in the opinion of Sir William Scott in the case of the
Fama. In such a case nothing passes until acceptance of it by
the king to whom the cession has been offered. And not

then, when it is as was the case in that instance; tWe cession
of Louisiana having been promised by preliminary articles
only, which.were to be followed by a convention stipulating
the measures, and the time to be fixed by common accord ,for
the execution of the first.
We have 'thus shown, that the conclusion to which this
court came in Reynes's case respecting grants of land in Louisiana, after the treaty of St. Ildefonso had been signed, is in
harmony with the usages and law of nations. They would
have required it, if the documents attending the transaction had
not led to the same result. It has been shown before, that the"
legislation of Congress would not permit a different conclusion.
The executive department of the government has uniformly
acted under the same impression.
Finally, all of our proceedings respecting Louisiana have
been done upon the principle, that the law of nations does not
recognize in a nation ceding a territory the continuance of
supreme power over it after the treaty has been. signed, or any
other exercise of sovere'gnt-y than that which is necessary for
social order and for commercial purposes, and to keep the cession in an unaltered value, until a delivery of it has been 'made.
Such being the extent of sovereignty under such circumstances, is not the grant of a perpetual ferry franchise attached to
land as much prohibited as a grant of land?
We cannot distinguish between them, as to the source from
which they can only be made. They are only distinguishable
from each other in this, that one of them is exclusively for the
grantee, and. the other for the use of the public, with a compensatory right of toll attached. If a ferry franchise could be
given in such a case, every other franchise' might be. When
the extent of Spanish royal prerogative in respect to franchises
is considered, and especially such as the king of Spain could
give in his foreign dominions under the Roman civil law,
without any modification of it in the Partidas, it will not be
forgotten, that natural persons and bodies corporate might
have been invested with monopolizing privileges and; exemptions, both on the land and the water,--that charters could
have been given to places, with licenses and exemptiogs which
might have interfered seriously with the policy and institu-'
tions of a state coming into the possession of ceded territory.
We will not mention them in detail. Enough Aas been said
to show, that, if such a sovereignty could be exercised .after a
treaty has been signed, it would be a power to change materially the relations which the people of a ceded territory had
to each other; and to establish between, them and a new soy-

ereign a different condition than had been contemplated when
they were transferred.
Such being the law of this case, we must say that the appellant, under the privilege of a ferry right given by the Marquis de Casa Calvq, had no property in it secured by the third
article of the treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the
United States, and that no contract arose from it, the obligation of which has been impaired either by the legislation of
Louisiana, or the action of the Police Jury of Concordia, under it.
We will remark further, that nothing can be inferred from
what we have said in favor of the validity of any franchise
relating to the navigation of the Mississippi, if any such was
granted whilst Louisiana was a province either of France or
Spain.
We will not enter minutely into the history of the retrocession of Louisiana to France, or into that attending our acquisition of it. There is much in both to confirm the views we
have expressed concerning national rights arising under treaties
signed, and afterwards ratified. We have now, too, other
sources of information, contemporary with the transation,
-which disclose more fully than was known until within a few
years the policy of the First Consul in acquiring Louisiana.
Stimulgted by the European desire for colonies, and to counteract the impressions which might be made upon his popularity,
and the glory he had given to France, if Egypt should be lost
and St. Domingo should become valueless from the revolt of
its slaves, he determined to avail himself of his power to gratify
the wishes of the king and queen of Spain, by makirig the infant Duke of Parma a king in and over a part of Italy, with all
royal rights and honors, and to get Louisiana in return. He
meant to make it a permanent colony of France. He negotiated, as the treaties show, for an absolute retrocession of its
people and territory, without other limitation than that which
the law of nations secured to the former. It was to belong to
France as it had been, when the generous weakness of Louis
the Fifteenth, without either cause or consideration, ceded it to
Spain. On the other hand, that portion of Italy which was to
be given for it was to be an unconditional transfer of people
and territory, which, in the event of the failure of the issue of
its new king, were to become absolutely a part of the Spanish
monarchy. Neither contemplated any thing else, or that Spain
should exercise a-complete dominion in Louisiana, after having
signed a treaty to cede it. There is not in the diplomacy of
nations a more absolute surrender of dominion, than was made

by the king of Spain in the treaty of St. Ildefonso of October,
1800.
From that time until the treaty of Amiens was made, and
afterwards, when it was foreseen it would be but a short truce,
and would be followed by wars of longer duration, and greater
changes in the condition of European nations than had been
made in the wars of the ten preceding years, the First Consul,
amidst all of his grand contemplations, did not lose sight for a
moment of the colonization of Louisiana. Troops were embarked to take possession of it. Plans were made to colonize
it exclusively with Frenchmen. He saw what might become
our pressure upon it from the West, and to guard against the
chances of war, which were then in this hemisphere in favor
of England, it was to have been in its beginning a military"
colony under a leader of marked character and renown. France
looked for commercial advantages from it, and a commanding
war position over the Gulf of Mexico. It was hoped, too, that
it would give to France, in the foreseen wars of Europe, favorable influences over the United States. That such a power as
France, between the United States and Mexico, would check
us in our career in that direction, and would give to France the
control of Mexico, and the continuance of her control over
Spain itself. It was not in the order of Providence, that such
intentions should be accomplished. The First Consul foresaw
a war, in which all the resources of France would be wanted,
and all that could be gathered from every source. The war
came sooner than he anticipated, or meant that it should. It
deprived him of all certain ability to take possession, or to retain Louisiana if he had done so. The navy of England was
in his way. With his usual decision, and in opposition to his
counsellors, he determined to sell Louisiana to the United
States,; when we were then only negotiating for such a part of
it as would secure to us the transit of our Western produce to
the ocean. Our ministers, with promptitude never to be forgotten, without orders or powers from home to do so, secured
the prize by the treaty of the 30th of April, 1803.

The laws of M3issippi limit the liability of the sureties in the official bond of a
sheriff to the amount of the penalty.
Mhere the surety had been compelled to pay the whole amount of his bond before a
third party recovered judgment, the surety ought to have been relieved against an
excution by this third party.
Not having been allowed to plead puis darreincontinuance, and protect himself in this
way by showing that he had paid the fall amount of his bond, the surety ought to
have been relieved in equity where he bad filed a bill for relief.

States for the Southern District of Mississippi. It arose from a
former case in this court, McNutt v. Bland et al., reported in 2
Howard, 9.
'The facts were these.
On the 6th of November, 1837, Richard J. Bland was elected
sheriff of the County of Claiborne, in the State of Mississippi,
for the term of two years, prescribed in the constitiation of that
State.
On the 10th of November, 1837, Richard J. Bland, Benjamin
G. Humphreys, and John Grissom, all bf that county and State,
exbcuted a penal bond, in the sum of $ 15,000, to Ch4rles
Lynch, Governor 6f the State, conditioned for the faithful execution by Bland of the duties of his office.
On the 30th of December, 1837, a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum was issued, at the suit of Leggett, Smith, and Lawrence, on a judgment obtained by them, as they allege, in the
Circuit Court of the United States for Mississippi, against George
W. McNider, for $ 3,910.78, on the 17th of November, 1837;
and the said writ was placed in the hands of the Marshal of
the United States for Mississippi, who took McNider into custody by virtue thereof, and delivered him for safe-keeping to
Bland, as the sheriff of Claiborne County.
