THE UNIoN INSURANCE COMPANY.

Insurance on a vessel and freight "at and from Tenerifflo to the Havanna, and at and from thence to New-York, with liberty to stop at
,Matanzas," with a representation that the vessel was It to stop at
Matanias to know if there were aiy men of war off the Havarna."
The vessel sailed on the voyage insured, and put into Matanzas to
avoid British cruizers, who were then off the Havanna, and were in
the practice of capturing neutral vessels, trading from one Spanish
port to another. While at Matanzas she unladed her cargo, under
an order from the Spanish authorities; and afterwards proceeded toHavanna, whence she sailed on her voyage for New-York, and was afterwards lost , by the perils of the seas. It was proved that the stopping and delay at the Havanna was necessary to avoid capture, that
no delay was occasioned by discharging the cargo, and that the 1Ilsk
was not increased, but diminished.
Held, that the order of the Spanish government was obtained under
such circumstances as took from it the character of a vis major imposed upon the master, and was, therefore, no exclise for discharging
the cargo ; but that the stopping and delay at Matanzas were per.
mitted by the policy, and that the unlading the cargo was not adeviation. This case distinguished from that of the Maryland Imn&o.

the port of, Havanna, and who were then in the practice of capturing American vessels sailing from one
Spanish port to another. On the 6th of July, as soon
as the passage was clear, she proceeded o the Havanna, whence, on the 14th of July, she sailed on her voyage to New-York. On the 28th of that month she
foundered at sea, and was totally lost. The action
was for the insurance on the vessel and freight from
the Havanna. The underwriters gave in evidence,,that
while at Matanzas she unladed her cargo, and insisted
that this was a deviation, by which they were discharged, To repel this evidence, the plaintiffs showed that
the stopping and delay at Matanzas were necessary to
avoid capture, and, therefore, allowed by the policy;
that no delay was occasioned by discharging the cargo;
that the risk was not increased, but diminished by it;
and that an order from the Spanish government had
made this act necessary.
The court instructed the jury, that unlading the
cargo at Matanzas was a deviation which discharged
the underwriters, unless it was rendered necessary by
the order of the Spanish government at the Havanna.
That in this case the order did not justify such unlading, and that the underwriters were, consequently,
d'scharged. Under these directions the jury found
a veidict for the defendants. The plaintiff having

don from the Spanish government, which being a
vis major, excused the master. That in this case the
risk was not increasedbut diminished, by stopping at Matanzas. Neither party"is at liberty to vary the risk;
but this rule applies to cases where the change may.produce some inconvenience to .th iusurer, not where it
does actually produce it merely. Unnecessary deviation always discharges the underwriters, because it
may increase the risk. But here the policy permitted
the stopping and delay at Matanzas; and die risk not
only could not be increased, but was actually diminished by discharging the cargo, and proceeding with the
vessel close along the shore to the Havanna. This
doctrine is not impugned, in the Maryland Insurance
Company v. Le Roy et al.a That case went on the
ground of variation from the terms of the policy. The

Mr. Winder, and Mr. jones, contra, argued, that the
proceedings of the Spahish authorities were a mere
permission, which the party might ise or not at his
pleasure, and not an imperious mandate which he was
compelled to obey. It is an elementary principle of insurance law, that whether the deviation increase the
risk or not, it discharges the underwriters.a The case
of the Maiyland Insurance Company v. Le Roy etal. illustrates the rule, and the jury there found that taking
on board the jackasses did not increase the risk. Discharging the cargo at a place where permission is only
given to touch, is a deviation,b It is immaterial whether the risk be increased, or diminished, or remaib the
same in quantum. In Raine v. Bell, the jury found
that the vessel would have otherwise been necessarily
detained while she was taking in the cargo; and that
case proves nothing more than that, while so detained,
the master, inay take in cargo, but not break bulk.
Staying to unlade increases the risk; but taking cargo
on board, while necessarily detained, does not increase
or alter the risk.

Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion Feb., T
of the court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as
follows:
At the trial the cause seems to have turned princi- pally on the necessity to unlade the cargo at Mantanzas produced by the order of the Spanish government
at the Havanna. As this court concurs with the circuit
judge in the opinion that this order was obtained under
circumstances which take from it the character of a
force imposed on the master, and compelling him to
discharge his cargo, and is, therefore, no excuse for
such discharge, it will be unnecessary farther to notice
that part of the case. The question to be considered
is, that part of the opinion which declares that unlading
the cargo at Matanzas, although it occasioned no delar
and did, not increase, but diminish the risk, was a deviation which discharged the underwriters.

If, however, the case has been otherwise decided, especially in this court, those decisions must be respected.

Raine v. Bell, and this case, the court can perceive no
essential difference.
In the supreme court of Pennsylvania, (Kingston v.
Gerard, 4 Dal. 274.) a similar question occurred, and it
was there held, that unlading and selling part of her
cargo by a captured vessel during her detention, would
not avoid the policy.
But it is contended, that this point has been settled in Thiscae
ditinuihedthis court, in the case of the Maryland Insurance Corn- fromte
pany against Le Roy and others. In that case, a liber-rylandIns.Co,
v. Le Roy at
ty was reser ved in the policy "to touch at the Cape deat. 7 crunh,

Verd Islands for the purchase of stock, such as hogs, .
goats, and poultry, and faking in water." The vessel
stopped at Fago, one of the Cape de Verd Islands, and
took in four bullocks and four Jackasses, besides water and other provisions, unstowed the dry goods, and
broke open. two bales, and took 40 pieces out of each,
for trade. The vessel remained at the island from'the
7th to the 24th of May, although the usual delay at
those islands for taking in stock and water, when the
weather is good, is from two to three days. The weather was good during this delay; and the bullocks and
jackasses encumbered the deck of the vessel, more than
small stock would have done. The court left it to the

perfectly clear, that the case of the Maryland
It -is
Insurance Company v. Le Roy and others, differs inaterially from this. In that case, articles were taken on
board xihich encumbered the deck of the vessel, and
which were not'within the liberty reserqed in the policy. In that case too, the insured trade 1, and the delay
was considerable and unnecessary ; the risk, if not increased, might be, and certainly was varied. The
judge, therefcre, ought not to have left it to the jury
on the single point of increase of risk by taking in the
jackasses. Although the risk might not be thereby increased, the unauthorised delay and unauthorised trading during that delay, connected with taking on board
unautborised articles, discharged the underwriters according to the settled principles of law ; and the court
does not say in that case that these circumstancR- were
immaterial or without influence. The court does not

Judgment reversed.
a In the case of Urquhart v.
Barnard, it was held by the
English court of C. B. that if
a ship has liberty, to touch at
a port, it is no deviation to
take in merchandize during
her allowed stay there., if she
does by means thereof exceed
the period allowed for her remaining there. And that if
liberty be given to touch at a
port, the contract not defining
for what purpose, but a communication having been made
to the underwriter, that the
ship was to touch for a ptrpose of trade, it shall be intended as a liberty to touch
