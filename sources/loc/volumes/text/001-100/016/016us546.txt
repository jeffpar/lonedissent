The libel then prays, that the defendants, as the owners of the Scourge, may be decreed to pay to the
libellants the damages respectively sustained by them
by the illegal conduct of the said boat's crew, with al,
other charges and expenses thereb 'incurred, and losses th'erefrom accruing, and for such other relief as mxy
be suited to the case.
The defendants, by their answer and plea, admit
that they were, at the time mentioned in the libel, the
owners of the Scourge, which was regularly rommissioned as a private arned vessel "Zuring the late war;
and that whilst cruising on the high seas, she met with
the said Haytian schooner; 'but they do nt't admit tbpt
the -plundering, outrages, and other unlawlul aqts
mentioned in the libe.l, were committed as therein
bharged; they do, howelver, admit, that the said schoo

were committed by some of the said crew; but they. deny their responsibility therefor, especially as the- sw

-Samuel C. Lathrop, captain 'of marines on board

are of opinion that they are bound to repair all the real
injuries a'nd personal wrongs sustained by the libellants, but they. are not bound to the extent of vindictive damages. While the government of the country
shall choose to authorize the employment of privateers
in its public wavrs, with the knowledge that such endployment cannot be exeinpt from occasional irregularities and improper conduct, it connoi be the duty of
courts of justice to defeat the policy of the government,
by burthening the service'with a responsibility beyond
what justice requires, with a responsibility for unliquidated damages, resting in mere discretion, an& intended t6 punish offenders.
As the respondents have not appealed from the decree of the circuit court, that decree, so far as it allows

necessity occasioned by stress of weather, and the

The next item is 2,127 dollars and 60 cents. for The item for

of the costs of court. The evidence upon this ,headjected.
is not very satisfactory in its details. It is assei ted
that the vessel was seized for the want of papers, but
whether as prize of war, or to enforce a municipal
forfeiture, is not distinctly stated ; and no copy of the
proceedings of the court is produced to c'ear up a
single doubt or obscurity. Nor does it appear, whether the com~promise was made before or after the libel
was filed; and it. is admitted that it was made-without
taking the' advice of counsel, upon tle mere opinion
of a merchant at Antigua, who supposed that a condemnation would certainly ,ensue. Upon what legal grounds this opinion could be reasonably entertained, it is extremely difficult to perceive. Assuming
that the vessel and cargo were seized as prize of war,
it cannot for a moment be admitted, that the mere
want of papers could afford a just cause of condem-,
nation.
It might be a circumstance, of suspicion;
but explained (as it must have been) by the preparatory examinations of the officers and crew, andby
the fact of a'voluntary arrival, it is difficult td suppose that there could be any judicial hesitation in
immediately acquitting the propErty. And the farthest that any prize court could, by the utmost
straining,' be presumed to go, would be to order farther pxoof of the proprietary interest. It would be

reasonable. The utmost extent of loss to which the
owner was liable, was the payment of the costs and
expenses of bringing the pioperty to adjudication ; and
for such costs and expenses, as far as they were incur'
red and paid, the owner is now entitled to receive a
Aecompense. In this respect, the decree-of the circuit
court ought to be amended.
The item for the supercargo's commission was also

The sum of 41 dollars was (probably by mistake)
deducted by the circuit court from the expenses at An
tigua. This sum is to be reinstated.
To the decree of the circuit court there are, consequently, to be added the following sums :
