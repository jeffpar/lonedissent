APPEAL

,.

Mr. Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion Feb. 24th.
of the court In this case the libel alleges that the
goods in question were exported from Bordeaux in
Fiance, and entered at the office of the collector of the
customs at New Orleans, and that they were invoiced at
a less sum than the actual cost thereof at the place of
exportation, with design to evade the duties thereon,
contrary to the provisions of the 66th section of the
collection law of 1799, ch. 128. It appears in the case,
that the goods were oliginally shipped from Liverpool,
and were landed at Bordeaux. All question as to continuity of voyage, and as to whether Liverpool or Bordeaux ought to be deemed the place of exportation, is
out of the case, because the information charges the
goods to have been exported from Bofdeaux. Upon
the evidence, it appears that the goods were invoiced
at sixty or seventy per cent. below the price in NewOrleans; which it is supposed was at least-as high as
the price -would have been in Liverpool: But it also appears that goods of this kind, at the time of their exportation from Bordeaux, were depreciated in value to
an equal degree: And it is proved that the samegoods
were offered to a 'witness at 50 per cent. below their
cost at Liverpool. The court is, therefore, not satisfied that the goods were .invoiced below their true vilue
at Bordeaux, with a design to evade the lawful duties;

ERROR to the circuit court of the district of South
Carolina.

of the State of New York, to which the defendant below pleait il debet, and the plaintiff below demurred.
The circuit court rendered a judgment for the plaintiff
below, and thereupon the cause was brought by writ of
error to this court.
Peb. 141h.

Mr. Hopkinson, for the plaintiff in error, suggested,
that if, under any possible circumstances, the plea of
nil debet could be a good bar to the action, a general
