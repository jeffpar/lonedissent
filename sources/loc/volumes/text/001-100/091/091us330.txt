The best evidence of this is to be found in the fact that he
claims in this action to recover more than $15,000 for alleged
loss of profits, while he has actually expended in preparation to
meet his obligations only $1,256.75.
The estimate of the number of hides as made in the contracts
does not create an obligation on the part of the United States
to deliver that number. That estimate was undoubtedly intended as a representation of the probable number of cattle
that would be delivered to the Indians. In point of fact, the
number actually delivered was very much less. Neither party
could determine how many would be reserved by the Commissioner for the use of the Indians. Therefore, necessarily, when
the contract was made, the number specified could not have
been understood to be a guaranteed number. If that number
or its approximation was not guaranteed, none was. It follows
as a consequence that this claimant has no right of action. He
took his risk, and insured himself in his anticipated large profits
if his venture proved a success.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.

SHEPLEY ET AL. V. COWANQ ET AL.
1. Whenever, in the disposition of the public lands, any action is required to be
taken by an officer of the land department, all proceedings tending to defeat
such action are impliedly inhibited. Accordingly, where an act of Congress
of 1812 directed a survey to be made of the out-boundary line of the village
of Carondelet, in the State of Missouri, so as to include the commons
claimed by its inhabitants, and a survey made did not embrace all the lands
thus claimed, the lands omitted were reserved from sale until the approval
of the survey by the land department, and the validity of the claim to the
omitted lands was thus determined.
2. Where a State seeks to select lands as a part of the grant to it by the eighth
section of the act of Congress of Sept. 4, 1841, and a settler seeks to
acquire a right of pre-emption to the same lands, the party taking the first
initiatory step, if the same is followed up to patent, acquires the better
right to tie premises. The patent relates back to the date of tie initiatory
act, and cuts off all intervening claimants.
8. The eighth section of the act of Sept. 4, 1841, in authorizing the State to
make selections of land, does not interfere with the operation of the other
provisions of that act regulating the system of settlement and pre-emption.
The two modes of acquiring title to land from the United States are not in

Oct. 1875.]

SHEPLEY ET AL. V. COWAN ET AL.

conflict with each other. Both are to have full operation, that one controlling in a particular case under which the first initiatory step was had.
4. Whilst, according to previous decisions of this court, no vested right in the
public lands as against the United Stales is acquired until all the prerequisites
for the acquisition of the title have been complied with, parties may, as
against each other, acquire a right to be preferred in the purchase or other
acquisition of the land, when the United States have determined to sell or
donate the property. In all such cases, the first in time in the commencement of proceedings for the acquisition of the title, when the same are regularly followed up, is deemed to be the first in right.
5. Where a party has settled upon public land with a view to acquire a right of
pre-emption, the land being open to settlement, his right thus initiated is
not prejudiced by a refusal of the local land-officers to receive his proofs of
settlement, upon an erroneous opinion that the land is reserved from sale.
6. The rulings of the land department on disputed questions of fact, made in a
contested case as to the settlement and improvements of a pre-emption
claimant, are not open to review by the courts when collaterally assailed.
7. The officers of the land department are specially designated by law to receive,
consider, and pass upon proofs presented with respect to settlements upon
the public lands, with a view to secure rights of pre-emption. If they errin
the construction of the law applicable to any case, or if fraud is practised
upon them, or they themselves are chargeable with fraudulent practices,
their rulings may be reviewed and annulled by the courts when a controversy arises between private parties founded upon their decisions. But, for
mere errors of judgment upon the weight of evidence in a contested case
before them, the only remedy is by appeal from one officer to another of
the department, and perhaps, under special circumstances, to the President.

The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

error.
.Mr. Jtfontgomery Blair and Mr. Britton A. Hill, contra.
MR. JusTICE FiELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit in equity, brought, according to the practice
obtaining in Missouri, to settle the conflicting claims of the
parties, arising from their respective patents, to a fractional
section of land comprising thirty-seven acres and two-fifths of
an acre, situated in that State. The plaintiffs assert title to
the premises under a patent issued to William M. McPherson by the governor of the State, bearing date on the 27th of
February, 1850, purporting to be for lands selected under the
eighth section of the act of Congress of Sept. 4, 1841, entitled
"An act to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the publio

[Sup. Ct.

lands, and to grant pre-emption rights" (5 Stat. 453); and the
defendants claim title to the" premises under a patent of the
United States, bearing date on the 21st of July, 1866, issued to
the heirs of Thomas Chartrand upon an alleged pre-emption
right acquired by a settlement of their ancestor.
The eighth section of the act of Sept. 4, 1841, declared that
there should be granted to each State specified in its first
section - and among them was the State of Missouri- five hundred thousand acres of land for purposes of internal improvement, the selection of the land in the several States to be made
within their respective limits, in such manner as the legislatures
thereof should direct, but in parcels conformably to sectional
divisions and subdivisions of the public surveys, and of not
less than three hundred and twenty acres in each, from any
public land except such as was or might be reserved from sale
by any law of Congress or proclamation of the President.
Several acts were passed by the legislature of Missouri for
the selection and disposition of the land thus granted. One
of them, passed on the 10th of March, 1849 (Laws of Missouri
of 1849, p. 64), authorized the governor of the State to dispose,
at private sale, of so much of the land as then remained to be
selected, and to issue to the purchasers certificates empowering
them to locate the quantity purchased, in conformity with the
act of Congress. The purchasers were to inform the governor
of the lands selected, and he was to notify the Secretary of the
Treasury that the selections were made for the State; and, if
approved by the secretary, patents were to issue to the purchasers.
Where the land selected in any instance contained less than
three hundred and twenty acres, the governor was required,
upon the request of the purchaser and upon payment for the
full amount, to relinquish the surplus to the United States.
Of the certificates thus issued, one was held by William M.
McPherson; and under it a selection was made by him of the
premises in controversy. Of this selection the governor of the
State informed the Secretary of the Treasury on the 15th of
December, 1849, and requested his approval of it; at the same
time relinquishing to the United States the surplus between
the amount selected and three hundred and twenty acres. At

Oct. 1875.]

SHEPLEY ET AL. V. COWAN ET AL.

that time the supervision of the land-office had been transferred from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Secretary of
the Interior, whose department was created in March of that
year. The selection of McPherson was accordingly brought
to the latter's attention, and was approved by him on the 17th
of January following; subject, however, to any rights which
may have existed at the time the selection was made known
to the land-officers by the agent of the State. On the 27th of
Febiuary following, a patent of the State of Missouri for the
premises was issued to McPherson by the governor. Upon the
title thus conferred the plaintiffs repose, and ask judgment in
their favor.
In considering the validity of this title, the first question for
solution is, whether the premises were then open to selection
by the State; for whether the eighth section of the act of
1841 be construed as conferring a grant in prcesenti, operating
to vest the title in the State upon the selection of the land
pursuant to its directions, notwithstanding the words of grant
used are in the future tense, -in that respect resembling the
grant of the State of North Carolina to General Greene, which
was the subject of consideration by this court in the case of
Rutherford v. Greene's Heirs, reported in the 2d of Wheaton, or whether the section be considered as giving only the promise
of a grant, and therefore requiring further legislation, or further action in some form of the government, to vest the title
of the land selected in the State, as held, or rather implied,
by the decision in the case of Poley v. Harrison,reported in
the 15th of Howard, the same result must follow if the land
were not at the time open to selection. If not thus open, the
whole proceeding on the part of McPherson and the governor
of the State to appropriate the land was ineffectual for any
puilnose. That the land was not thus open, we think there
is no doubt. The land was then claimed as part of the
commons of Carondelet. The villages of St. Louis and Carondelet, on the acquisition of Louisiana in 1808 and for many
years previously, claimed as commons certain lands adjoining
their respective settlements. Those of St. Louis extended
south of the village of that name, those of Carondelet to the
north of its village; and a well-known line was generally recog-

SHEPLEY ET AL.

V.

COWAN ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

nized as the boundary separating the commons of the two villages. That line commenced on the bank of the Mississippi
at what is known as Sugar-loaf Mound, about four miles south
of the settlement of St. Louis, and two miles north of that of
Carondelet, and ran westerly to the common fields of Caron delet. It was contended, in the controversy which subsequently arose between the cities of St. Louis and Carondelet,
that this line bad been surveyed and marked by Soulard, a
Spanish surveyor, previous to 1800, by order of the lieutenantgovernor of the upper province of Louisiana. Be that as it
may, it is clear that from the acquisition of the country until
June 13, 1812, the land south of this line was claimed and
used by the inhabitants of Carondelet as within their commons. On that day Congress passed an act confirming to the
inhabitants of these villages their claims to their common
lands. 2 Stat. 748. The act was a present operative grant
of all the interest of the United States in the property used
by the inhabitants of the villages as their commons; but it
did not refer to the line mentioned, or designate any boundary
of the commons, but left that to be established by proof of previous possession and use. The act at the same time made it
the duty of the deputy-surveyor of the territory to survey the
out-boundary lines of the villages so as to include the commons
respectively belonging to them, and make out plats of the surveys, and transmit them to the surveyor-general, by whom
copies were to be forwarded to the Commissioner of the General Land-Office and the recorder of land-titles. No survey
appears to have been made, as here directed, of the out-boundary line of the village of Carondelet, until the year 1816; but
its inhabitants claimed under the act the ownership and title
of the land as part of their commons, up to the line mentioned
on the north, as the same had been claimed and used by them
previously. In 1816 or 1817, Elias Rector, a deputy-surveyor,
under instructions from his superior, made a survey of the commons, running the upper line about a mile below the line
alleged to have been established by Soulard. Some years afterwards (in 1834), another deputy-surveyor, by the name of
Joseph C. Brown, was ordered by the surveyor-general to
retrace and mark anew the lines of this survey, and connect

them with the surveys of adjoining public lands and private
claims. This was accordingly -done by him; and it would
seem by various proceedings of the authorities of Carondelet
that the survey thus retraced was at one time acquiesced in
by them as a determination of the boundaries of their commons. They had a copy of it framed for the benefit of the
town, and they introduced it in several suits with different
parties as evidence of the extent of their claim. But at
another time they denied the correctness of its northern line,
which they insisted should be coincident with that alleged to
have been run by Soulard. When St. Louis, in 1836, proceeded to subdivide her commons into lots down to the line
of the survey, they gave notice, through a committee, that the
lands below the alleged Soulard line were claimed as part of
their commons; and, in 1855, Carondelet entered a suit against
St. Louis for the possession of those lands. In the mean time,
the matter remained undetermined in the land department at
Washington until the 28d of February of that year. During
this period, the Commissioner of the General Land-Office repeatedly informed the local land-officers that the tract was
reserved from sale because it was claimed as part of the Carondelet commons, and on that ground their refusal to receive
proofs of settlement from parties seeking to acquire a right of
pre-emption was approved; and appropriate entries stating such
reservation were made in the books of those officers. At one
time (January, 1852) the Secretary of the Interior decided to
have a new survey of the commons, and gave orders to that
effect. The surveyor-general for Missouri having asked instructions as to the manner of the survey, and stating that, in
his opinion, the new survey should include the land in controversy, the secretary then in office, the successor of the one who
had ordered a new survey, re-examined the whole subject, and
recalled the direction for a new survey made by his predecessor,
and held that as the surveys of 1816 and 1834 had been executed by competent authority and approved, and were for years
acquiesced in by the inhabitants of Carondelet, both they and
the government of the -United States were estopped and concluded by them; and that, in consequence, the survey of 1816,
as retraced in 1834, should be sustained, excluding therefrom

SHEPLEY ET AL. V.

[Sup. Ct.

a tract which had been reserved for a military post. This was
the final determination of the boundaries of the Carondelet
commons by that department of the government to which the
supervision of surveys of public grants was intrusted. A few
days before this determination was announced, the suit mentioned, of the city of Carondelet against the city of St. Louis,
was commenced to obtain possession of the lands below the
Soulard line, over a portion of which the St. Louis commons
had been extended. That suit was finally disposed of by the
judgment of this court in March, 1862, affirming that of the
Supreme Court of the State, to the effect that both the government and Carondelet were concluded by the surveys stated.
The act of 1812 contemplated that the out-boundary line of
the village would be surveyed so as to include the commons
claimed, in accordance with the possession of the inhabitants
previous to 1803, and not arbitrarily, according to the caprice
of the surveyor; and any line run by him was subject, like all
other surveys of public grants, to the supervision and approval
of the land department at Washington. Until surveyed, and
the survey was thus approved, the land claimed by Carondelet
was, by force of the act requiring the survey and the establishment of the boundaries, necessarily reserved from sale. It was
thus reserved to be appropriated in satisfaction of the claim, if
that should be ultimately sustained. Whenever in the disposition of the public lands any action is required to be taken by
an officer of the land department, all proceedings tending to
defeat such action are impliedly inhibited. The allowance of
selections by the States, or of pre-emptions by individuals, of
lands which might be included within grants to others, might
interfere, and in many instances would interfere, with the accomplishment of the purposes of the government. A sale is as
much prohibited by a law of Congress, when to allow it would
defeat the object of that law, as though the inhibition were in
direct terms declared. The general rule of the land department is, and from the commencement of the government has
been, to hold as excluded from sale or pre-emption lands which
might, in the execution of the laws of Congress, fall within
grants to others; and therefore, in this case, until it was decided by the final determination of the Secretary of the Inte-

rior or of the Supreme Court of the United States whether
the northern line of the commons was that run, as alleged,
by Soulard previous to 1800, or that retraced by Brown in
1834, the land between those lines, embracing the premises
in controversy, was legally reserved from sale, and, consequently, from any selection by the State as part of its five
hundred thousand acres granted by the act of Sept. 4, 1841.
But there is another view of this case which is equally fatal
to the claim of the plaintiffs. If the land outside of the survey as retraced by Brown in 1834 could be deemed public land,
open to selection by the State of Missouri from the time the
survey was returned to the land-office in St. Louis, it was
equally open from that date to settlement, and consequent preemption by settlers. The same limitation which was imposed
by law upon settlement was imposed by law upon the selection
of the State. In either case the land must have been surveyed,
and thus offered for sale or settlement. The party who takes
the initiatory step in such cases, if followed up to patent, is
deemed to have acquired the better right as against others to
the premises. The patent which is afterwards issued relates
back to the date of the initiatory act, and cuts off all intervening
claimants. Thus the patent upon a State selection takes effect
as of the time when the selection is made and reported to the
land-office; and the patent upon a pre-emption settlement takes
effect from the time of the settlement as disclosed in the declaratory statement or proofs of the settler to the register of the
local land-office. The action of the State and of the settler
must, of course, in some way be brought officially to the notice
of the officers of the government having in their custody the
records and other evidences of title to the property of the Unitid
States before their respective claims to priority of right can be
recognized. But it was not intended by the eighth section of
the act of 1841, in authorizing the State to make selections of
land, to interfere with the operation of the other provisionb
of that act regulating the system of settlement and preemption. The two modes of acquiring title to land from the
United States were not in conliict with each other. Both were
to have full operation, that one controlling in a particular case
under which the first initiatory step was had.

[Sup. Ct.

Nor is there any thing in this view in conflict with the doctrines announced in Prisbiev. TVlhitney, 9 Wall. 187, and the
Yosemite Valley Case, 15 id. 77. In those cases the court
only decided that a party, by mere settlement upon the public
lands, with the intention to obtain a title to the same under the
pre-emption laws, did not thereby acquire such a vested interest
in the premises as to deprive Congress of the power to dispose
of the property; that, notwithstanding the settlement, Congress
could reserve the lands for sale whenever they might be needed
for public uses, as for arsenals, fortifications, light-houses, hospitals, custom-houses, court-houses, or other public purposes for
which real property is required by the government; that the
settlement, even when accompanied with an improvement of
the property, did not confer upon the settler any right in the
land as against the United States, or impair in any respect the
power of Congress to dispose of the land in any way it might
deem proper; that the power of regulation and disposition conferred upon Congress by the Constitution only ceased when all
the preliminary acts prescribed by law for the acquisition of
the title, including the payment of the price of the land, had
been performed by the settler. When these prerequisites were
complied with, the settler for the first time acquired a vested
interest in the premises, of which he could not be subsequently
deprived. He was then entitled to a certificate oi entry from
the local land-officers, and ultimately to a patent of the United
States. Until such payment and entry, the acts of Congress
gave to the settler only a privilege of pre-emption in case the
lands were offered for sale in the usual manner; that is, the
privilege to purchase them in that event in preference to others.
But whilst, according to these decisions, no vested right as
against the United States is acquired until all the prerequisites
for the acquisition of the title have been complied with, parties
may, as against each other, acquire a right to be preferred in
the purchase or other acquisition of the land, when the United
States have determined to sell or donate the property. In all
such cases, the first in time in the commencement of proceedings
for the acquisition of the title, when the same are regularly
followed up, is deemed to be the first in right. So in this case,
Chartrand, the ancestor, by his previous settlement in 1835

upon the premises in controversy, and residence with his family,
and application to prove his settlement and enter the land, obtained a better right to the premises, under the law then
existing, than that acquired by McPherson by his subsequent
State selection in 1849. His right thus initiated could not be
prejudiced by the refusal of the local officers to receive his proofs
upon the declaration that the land was then reserved, if, in point
of fact, the reservation had then ceased. The reservation was
asserted, as already mentioned, on the ground that the land was
then claimed as a part of the commons of Carondelet. So soon
as the claim was held to be invalid to this extent by the decision
of this court in March, 1862, the heirs of Chartrand presented
anew their claim to pre-emption, founded upon the settlement of
their ancestor. The act of Congress of March 3, 1853, 10 Stat.
244, provided that any settler who had settled or might thereafter settle on lands previously reserved on account of claims
under French, Spanish, or other grants, which had been or
should thereafter be declared invalid by the Supreme Court of
the United States, should be entitled to all the rights of preemption granted by the act of Sept. 4, 1841, after the lands
were released from reservation, in the same manner as if no
reservation had existed. With the decision declaring thb invalidity of the claim to the land in controversy, all obstacles
previously interposed to the presentation of the claim of the
heirs of Chartrand, and the proofs to establish it, were removed.
According to the decisions in _Frisbie v. Whitney and the Yosemite Valley Case, Congress might then have withdrawn the
land from settlement and pre-emption, and granted it directly to
the State of Missouri, or reserved it from sale for public purposes, and no vested right in Chartrand or his heirs as against
the United States would have been invaded by its action; but,
having allowed by its subsisting legislation the acquisition of a
right of preference as against others to the earliest settler or
his heirs, the way was free to the prosecution of the claim of
the heirs.
If the matter were open for our consideration, we might perhaps doubt as to the sufficiency of the proofs presented by the
heirs of Chatrand to the officers of the land department to
establish a right of pre-emption by virtue of the settlement and

SHEPLEY ET AL. V. COWAN ET AL.

[Sup. Ct.

proceedings of their ancestor, or by virtue of their own settlement. Those proofs were, however, considered sufficient by
the register of the local land-office, by the Commissioner of the
General Land-Office on appeal from the register, and by the
Secretary of the Interior on appeal from the commissioner.
There is no evidence of any fraud or imposition practised upon
%hem,or that they erred in the construction of any law applitble to the case. It is only contended that they erred in their
ductions from the proofs presented; and for errors of that
kind, where the parties interested had notice of the proceedings
before the land department, and were permitted to contest the
same, as in the present case, the courts can furnish no remedy.
The officers of the land department are specially designated by
law to receive, consider, and pass upon proofs presented with
respect to settlements upon the public lands, with a view to
secure rights of pre-emption. If they err in the construction
of the law applicable to any case, or if fraud is practised upon
them, or they themselves are chargeable with fraudulent practices, their rulings may be reviewed and annulled by the courts
when a controversy arises between private parties founded
upon their decisions; but, for mere errors of judgment upon
the weight of evidence in a contested case before them, the
only remedy is by appeal from one officer to another of the de
partment, and perhaps, under special circumstances, to the
President. It may also be, and probably is, true that the courts
may furnish, in proper cases, relief to a party where new evidence is discovered, which, if possessed and presented at the
time, would have changed the action of the land-officers; but,
except in such cases, the ruling of the department on disputed
questions of fact made in a contested case must be taken, when
that ruling is collaterally assailed, as conclusive.
In this case, therefore, we cannot inquire into the correctness
of the ruling of the land department upon the evidence presented of the settlement of Chartrand, the ancestor, or of his
heirs. It follows that the patent issued by the United States,
taking effect as of the date of such settlement, overrides the
patent of the State of Missouri to McPherson, even admitting,
that, but for the settlement, the land would have been open to
