UNITED STATES v. NORTON.
A motion to advance a criminal cause made on behalf of the United States must
state the facts in such manner that the court may judge whether tle government will be embarrassed in the administration of its affairs by delay.

THIs case came up on a certificate of division between the
judges of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.
111r. Attorney- aeneralPierrepont,for the United States, submitted a motion to advance the cause.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
This is a criminal case. The motion to advance is made on
behalf of the United States, upon the representation of the
Postmaster-General, in substance, that the questions in dispute
will embarrass the operations of the government while they
remain unsettled. As our rule has but recently gone into
operation, we will, in this case, accept this statement as sufficient, and grant the motion. Hereafter, motions to advance
upon this ground must state the facts in such manner that we
may judge whether the government will be embarrassed in the
administration of its affairs by delay. In the present crowded
state of the docket, it is our duty to see that cases are not unnecessarily brought forward to the prejudice of others.
The ease may be set down for argument on the fifteenth day of
MTarch.
