THE UNITED STATES, AT RELATION OF AARON GOODRICH,
PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. JAMES GUTHRIE, SECRETARY OF THE
TREASURY.
The circuit court of the United States for the District of Columbia, had not the
power to issue a writ of mranhnas, commanding the secretary of the treasury to
pay a judge of the territory of Minnesota his salary, for the unexpired term of his
office, from which he had been removed by the President of the United States.
No court has the power to command the withdrawal of money from the treasury of
the United States, to pay any individual claim whatever.
A mandamus can issue only in cases where the act to be done is merely ministerial,
and with regard to which nothing like judgment or discretion, in the performance
of his duties, is left to the officer.
The question, whether or not the President has power to remove a territorial judge,
argued, but not decided in the present case.

Tis
case was brought up, by writ of error, from the circuit
court of the United States for the District of Columbia, holden
in and for the county of Washington.
The facts were these On the 19th March, 1849, the President appointed, by and
with the advice and consent of the senate, A. Goodrich, to be
chief justice of the supreme court of the Territory of Minnesota, for four years, which appointment was accepted.
On 21st of October, 1851, the President of the United States
thought proper to remove
rI. Goodrich, and to appoint Jerome
Fuller to the office; of which removal Mlr. Goodrich was
informed by an official letter from the department of state,
dated 22d October, 1851, and received by him on 30th November, 1851, as stated by him.

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

285

The United States v. Guthrie.

Mr. Goodrich denied the power of the President to remove
him from office during the term of four years, and claimed his
salary from and after his removal. The accounting officers of
the treasury paid him his salary up to 30th November, 1851,
and refused to pay beyond that day.
Mr. Goodrich moved the circuit court of the United State's
for the District of Columbia and county of Washington, for a
rule upon the secretary of the treasury, to show cause why a
mandamus should not -issue, to compel the payment of the.
salary to Mr. Goodrichi up to 19th March, 1853, when the term
named in his ecmmission expired. The court refused to grant
the rule.
From this refusal, Mr. Goodrich brought the case up to this
court, by writ of error.
It was argued by Mr. Lawrence, for the plaintiff in error, and
by .Mr. Cushing, (attorney-general,) for the defendant.
Mr. Lawrence cnutended: 1. That the President had not the power to remove the
relator, during the four years from his appointment.
2. That the mandamus prayed for was the* appropriatp
remedy.
The argument of Tlr. Lawrence will be given as a reply to
M1r. Cushing.
Mr. Cushing argued: 1. The power of removal; 2. The propriety of the mandamus.
1. As to the power of removal.
The statute creating the supreme court for the territory of
Minnesota was approved 3d. March, 1849; to be found in
9 Stats. at Large, 406; ch. 121, § 9.
The power of appointing the justices of this territorial court
is vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent
of the senate, (by § 11.)

behavior, but, expressly limits it to
The commission to Mr. Goodrich follows the statute, and is
limited to four years from the day of the date, 19th larch,
1851.
By the constitution of the United States some offices are for
a term of years, and some are during good behavior, which, in
contemplation of law, is for life. The President and Vice-President are elected for four years, senators for six, and members
of the house of representatives for two years. Judges, both of
the supreme and inferior courts of the United States, are to be

appointed for life or during good behavior; for life and for and
during good behavior being synonymous in law. But all civil
officers, whether holding for years or for life, " shall be removed
from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors." The house
of representatives have the sole power of impeachment; the
senate have the sole power to try all impeachmnents.
Such being the theory of the constitution of the United
States, the question arose at the first session of the first congress under the constitution, as to the President's power of
removal ol all officers whose tenure of office was not, by the
constitution itself, declared to be during good behavior.
That important question was discussed by men of eminent
learning and patriotism, composing the first congress under the
federal constitution. The opinions of the distinguished men
who then composed the house of representatives, have been
reported, (4 Elliott's Debates, Part II. 141-208.) The senate
then sat with closed doors, so that the debates in that house are
not reported.
The debate upon the President's power of removal from office
arose upon the bill for establishing the executive department,
denominated the department of foreign affairs. This power of
removal from office, in all its aspects- and bearings und1er the
constitution, was discussed in the house of representatives, until
the subject was exhausted. The power of the President to
remove all officers, who, by the constitution it3elf, wdre not
declared to hold their offices during good behavior, was sustained by both houses; they concurred in passing an act constituting the department of foreign affairs, which was approved
by President Washington, on 27th July, 1789, in the 2d section
of which the President's power of removal is acknowledged,
Stats. at Large, 29, -ch. 4, § 2.)
So likewise in the act constituting the war department, approved 7th August, 1789, (same volume, p. 50, ch. 7, § 2.) So
also in the act constituting the department of treasury, approved 2_d September, 1789, (same volume, p. 67, ch. 12, § 7.)
So likewise in the act constituting the -navy department, approved by President Adams, 30th April, 1798, (same volume, p.
554, ch. 35, § 1.) And also in "An act to establish the postoffice of the United States," approved 2d March, 1799, (same
volume, p. 733, ch. 43, § 1.) And in the act establishing the
home department, approved 3d March, 1849, (vol. 9, p. 395, ch.
108, § 1,) it is enacted, that the secretary of the interior shall be
appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent
of the senate, "who shall hold his office by the same tenure
0 0 0 as the secretaries of the other executive departments.

DECEMBER TERMtI,

1854.

287

The United States v. Guthrie.

It appears from the published debates in the house of repreentatives, (in the year 1789, before alluded to,) that the principal
difference of opinion between the members of that house, was,
whether the power of removal from office belonged to the
President alone, or to the President and senate. By some it
whs thought that, as the advice and consent of the senate was
necessary to the appointment, it should also be necessary to the
removal. But it was answered, that the senate had no power
to nominate, to appoint, or to- commission; that the power to
nominate, to appoint, and to commission, was with the President; that after the senate had advised and consented to a
nomination, the President could decline to grant a commission,
and nominate another for the office; that the senate had no
means to compel the appointment, or the retainer in office, of
any particular person, where the - office was within the gift
of the President; that appointment and removal were_ strictly
executive powers, by and under the constitution; that the constitution vested the executive power in the President; that the
legislative power and the executive power could not be blended
any further than was expressly permitted by the constitution;
and, finally, that if the senate were to be consulted, - and, in
case of recess, to be convened,- the remedy would be too
dilatory and incomplete, and the proper responsibility of the
President would be dissipated.
The construction of the constitution, as concurred in by the
two houses of the first congress, and approved by President
Washington, resolved these points
1. That in a republican government public offices are created
for the benefit of the people; that the officer does not hold a
private estate and property in the office, and when the officer
is unfit, for any cause whatever, he ought to be displaced, and
another appointed for the benefit of the people and their security; or, if the office itself be found, upon experience, to be
unnecessary, it should be abolished.
2. That the constitution contains the power of removal,
otherwise the declaration that the judges should hold their
offices during good behavior would have been unnecessary and
tautologous.. - The express declaration that the judges shall
hold their offices during good behavior, necessarily implies that
the other officers shall 4ot hold during good behavior, but at
will, durante bene plzito.
3. That the power of removal from office is incident to the
power of appointment.
4. That the power of impeachment was a compulsory mode
of getting rid of officers guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors,
the favoritism of the executive notwithstanding.
-

288

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guthrie.

5. That impeachment was not, and ought not to be, the only
mode of removing officers; for whilst a mere intention to commit a high crime or misdemeanor is not a ground of impeach.
ment, yet a fixed design in an officer to commit a misdemeanor
in his office ought to be hindered from consummation by a
timqly removal. Moreover, there are various causes, short of
the crimes and misdemeanors upon which impeachment may
be grounded, which are sufficient to loosen the confidence of
the President -and the community in the officer; and, therefore,
good reasons why he shouldbe removed, such as insanity, incompetency, inattention, bad -Iabits, or ill-fame.
6. That the duty imposed by the constitution on the President, to "take care that the laws be faithfully executed," absolutely requires that he should have the power of removing
unfit, negligent, disobedient, or faithless officers; that without
the power of removal, the President would be without the
means of performing the duty of causing the laws to be faithfully executed; and if he had not the means, he could .not be
justly held responsible for his failure.
8. That, if impeachment was the only mode by which improper officers could be removed, the remedy,, in by far -&e
greatest number 6f instances, would be inadequate, too slow,
too expensive, and the government be impracticable, inefficient,
and incompetent to the purposes and ends for which it was
instituted.
9. That, in so far as the executive power of removing all
officers not holding by the constitution during good behavior
had been conferred on the President by the constitution, such
his constitutional power could not be impaired by the legislature ; nothing but an amendment to the constitution could take
it from him.
(Mr. Cushing then argued that this construction of the
constitution had been sustained by this court, and referred to
the case of ex pare Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259. He then contended that territorial judges were not judges within the
third article of the constitution; but that they came within
the clause giving to congress power to dispose of and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other
property of the United States; and, also, within the 18th paragraph of the 8th section of article 1st, giving to congress the
power to make all laws hat may be necessary and proper, &c.,
&c.; and then proceeded): It seems to be well settled, not only by the action of congress,
but by the decisions of the supreme court of the United States,
and otherwise, that the various persons appointed to judicial
functions by the President of the United States are distinguished

into two great classes, so far as xegards the present question,namely, the judges of constitutional courts, and those of legisla-"
tive courts.
Constitutional courts -are such as are intended by the pioyis,;.
ions of the third article of the constitution. The judges of "
cla~ss, by the express terms of the conistitution, hold their offies
during good behavior. .It compiehends the judges of the supreme court, and of the various judicial circuits and districts,
into which the United States are subdivided.
Legislative courts are such as congrqss establishes, not under
the third article of the constitution, but either in virtue of the
general right of limited sovereignty which exists in the government, or of" some specific power in the constitution other thanthat above cited. Thus it has been adjudged that the jurisdiction, with which the courts of the territories are invested, is not
a part of the judicial power which is defined in the third article
of the constitution, but is conferred by congress, in the execution
of those general powers which that body possesses over the terri.
tories of the United States. American Insurance "Co. v. Canter,
1 Pet. 511, 546. See also State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling
Bridge Co. 13 How. 518, 563. In accordance with which doctrine, it is held that the judges of the territorial courts are not
subject to impeachment and trial before the senate of the United
States,- (Vir. Grunqy's opinion, 1st February, 1839,) and are
subject to removal from office at the discretion of the President
of. the United States. Mr. Crittenden's opinion, 23d January,
1851.
The action of congress, as already intimated, has been in
accordance with these views of the constitution. In many cases
it hasgiven to the judges of the territories a tenure of four years,
subject, of course, to removal by the President, (Louisiana,
2 Stats. at Large, 284; Arkansas, 3 lb. 495; Florida, 3 1b.657;
Iowa, 5 Tb. 238; Minnesota, 9 b. 406 ; New Mexico, 9 1b.449;
Utah, 9 lb. 465,) though in one case at least it has been a
tenure by good behavior. Wisconsin, 5 Stats. at Large, 13.
In the older cases, reference was made to the ordinance of
July 13, 1787, one of the earliest acts of congress;'that of August
7,1789, having for its object to adapt the ptovisions of that ordi-.
nance to the constifation; and the same power of appointment
and removal was thereby given to the President as had previously belonged to the United States in congress assembled.
Northwest Territory,. 1 St ts. at Large, 52; Illinois, 2 lb. 614;
Indiana, 2 Tb. 59; Mississippi, 1 lb. 550.
On the face of things, this might seem to have been a tenur6
by good behavior, because such is the language of the ordinance
of 1787; but as, by the constitution of the confederation, all the
VOL. XVII.

powers of the government were vested in the congress, that body
decided the question of good behavior for itself, and had the
power of removal upon its own estimation of what constituted
misbehavior; and that precise power was, by the act of 1789,
conferred on the President of the United States. In all these
acts, at any rate, it has been assumed that the tenure was not
that of the constitution, as provided by it for the depositaries of
the proper judicial power of the United States, it being, on the
contrary, either the general tenure of ordinary officers, or else
such definite tenure as in the particular case congress might sce
fit to prescribe; in doing which, congress obviously recognized
the fact that it was not a judicial tenure by virtue of the constitution.
(Mr. CGshirg then enumerated a long list of acts passed by
congress in conformity with the above views, and then proceeded : -)
From the year 1804 to this time, during a period of fifty
years, we have the concurring opinions and acts of eight congresses and seven Presidents of the United States, that the
judges of the courts of the territorial governments are not within
the third article of the constitution, declaring that the judges
therein referred to-shall hold their offices during good behavior;
but that the territorial judges may, rightfuly, and without any
violation of the constitution, be appointed to hold their offices
for four years only.
The supreme court of the United States have also concurred
in that construction of the constitution.
In the case of The American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet.
511, 546, the court decided that these territorial courts "are not
constitutiong courts, in which the judicial power conferred by
the constitution on the general government can be deposited.
0 0 0 0 They are legislative courts, created in virtue of the
general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or
in virtue of that clause which enables congress to mike all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to
the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in
the third article of the constitution, but is conferred by congress
in the execution of those general powers which that body possesses over the territories of the United States. ' * ' 0 In
legislating for them (the teiritories) congress exercises the combined powers of the general and of a state government"
Under the government of the United States there are no common law offices, no offices whose tenures depend upon ancient
usage.
AUl offices under the government of the United States are

DECEMBER TERMS 1854.

291

The United States v. Guthrie.

created, either by the law of nations, such as ambassadors and
other public ministers, or by the constitution and the statutes.
As to ambassadors and other public ministers, the usage of nations determines the tenure of their commissions to be at the
will of the appointing power.
If the heads of the executive departments could hold their
offices for life, against the will of the President, and in despite
of the differences of opinion between him and them as to public
measures, policy, and principles, the power of the President
would be feeble, incapable of causing the laws to be faithfully
executed. There would have been but little use in limiting the
term for which the President is elected to four years, if the heads
of the exeoutive departments, when once appointed, held their
offices for life. A President elected for the term of four years,
surrounded by heads of the departments holding their offices for
life, removable only by impeachment for, and conviction of,
high crimes and misdemeanors, would be a chief in name only,
but not in power, not justly responsible to the people if the laws
were not faithfully executed. To elect a President for the term
of four years, while the heads of the executive departments must
be appointed for life, would show a want of adaptation of the
parts. to each other, a senseless combination of desfructive'inconsistencie6, an absurd incongruity.
The constitution has avoided such conflision. Where.it has
intended that officers shall hold their offices during good behavior, it has so declared; and in so selecting particular classes
of offices to be holden during good behavior, it hvs virtually
announced that the others shall be removable at the will of the
appointing power. The usage of the government, the construction of the constitution from its beginning, the concurrent opinions or all the departments of the government, has been so. The
decisions of the supreme court, before cited, (1 Pet. 511, and 13
Tb. 230,) seem to be conclusive against the claim of the plaintiff,
Goodrich.
The general rule, "that an office is held 'at the will of either
party; unless a different tenure is expressed in the appointment,
or is implied by the nature of the office, or results from ancient
usage," is stated by the supreme court of the United States, ex
parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 260, and references are there given to the
judicial decisions of state tribunals, fortifying that construction
of the constitution of the United States.
All public officers, -whether for life, or for a term of years, or
at will, are subject to an.implied condition, that the officer, shall
well behave. But the condition, that the officer bene se gesserit
does npt give an officer appointed for a term of years, a tenure
quandiu se bene gesserit. A condition of good behatvior, and a

292

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guthrie.

tenure during good behavior, are distinct things. The condition
for good behavior is necessarily implied, and adheres to every
officer. The tenure during good behavior belongs only to those
officers in whose commissions that tenure is expressed.
Officers who are neither by the constitution, nor by the law
creating the offices, directed to be commissioned during good
behavior, hold their offices at the will of' the appointing power.
Such is the established doctrine as to the tenure of offices under
the government of the United States, settled by the concurrent
opinions of the legislative, the executive, and the judicial
departments, by cqntemporaneous construction, by long and
general usage of all the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the government.
2. Had the circuit court for-the District of Columbia the power
to grant a mandamus in this case against, the secretary of the
treasury ?
It devolves upon the party demanding the exercise of a power
to show that it exists. The English cases cited and relied upon
have no applicabPity, because the United States courts are not
clothed with the same powers as the King's Bench. 'While
that court exercises all power, except where specially limited,
the United States courts can only exercise such as are specially
conferred. States often confer very plenary powers upon their
high tribunals. Congress has been sparing in conferring them
upon national tribunals. It has nowhere conferred what is now
claimed. No authority has been given to institute suits against
the government while this proceeding, in effect, commences one,
tries it, gives judgment, and awards executionwithout appearance
or the intervention of a jury to settle facts. It seeks to reverse
the decision of the accounting officers, and to compel the secretary to violate the law, by forcibly taking from the treasurer and
paying out, without conforming to the provisions of the statutes.
Before Goodrich's account is settled by the accounting officers,
the secretary cannot issue his warrant on the treasurer for the
amount claimed; and, without such warrant, the treasurer could
not pay. The secretary cannot compel the comptroller to allow
the account, nor the treasurer to pay without a warrant properly
signed, certified, and recorded. To accomplish his object, Goodrich should have made the auditor, comptroller, secretary, treasurer,
and register parties, so as to compel each to perform his respective
duty under the acts of congress. In stating accounts of judges,
the accounting officers rely upon evidence from the proper department, as to who is commissioned, and are not at liberty to dispute it. In this case, the appropriations had been applied in
paying those who had the usual commissions. All these officers, except the register and treasurer, must exercise their

DECEMBER TERM,

discretion and judgment, and are responsible to the President
for their proper exercise. No case can be found where it has
been held that a judicial tribunal can control either, or compel
either to act contrary to his best judgment.
The 14th section of the judiciary act of 1789, 1 Stats. at
Large, 81, clothes the United States courts with power to issue
writs necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions,
but for no other purpose. In Smith v. Jackson, i Paine, 453,
455, T.HoraPsON, J., held that this power must be strictly followed,

and that the ciicuit court had not the superintending authority
of the King's Bench in England. The same principle was
established in MlcIntyre v. Wood, 7 Cranch, 504, the court refusing to compel a register of a land-office to perform a specific
duty. In this case it was stated, by Jonxsox, J., that the circuit,
court could not compel a collector of customs to grant a clearance. This principle was sustained and affirmed in McClung
v. Silliman, 6 Wheaton, 59S; 1 Kent, Com. 322; Bovier, L.
D. 7, title manzdamus; and McElrath v. McIntyre, 1 Law Rep.
N. L. 399.
It has been repeatedly held that a madamus cannot be
granted to compel the perfornance of an executive act, as this
most clearly is. Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 497; 1 Blond,
186, 189, 584; Bordley v. Lloyd, 1 H. and IcIlI 27; Runkle v.
Winemiller, 4 lb. 429; Wittions v. Cadman, G. and J. 184;
Elliott v. The Levy Court, 1 H. and McI- 559; Brashears v.
Mason, 6 Hawk. 92-102.
In Kendall's case, it was held that where a mere ministerial
act was involved, under an express statute, a monaamts could
issue, but not when judgment or discretion were to be exercised
in determining upon a matter of fagt or of law. In the present
case, the treasury officers passed upon the questions, whether
Goodrich was in office, and whether there was inoney appropriated to pay him. This court cannot, on this application, review
their decision. If.it could do so, it might do the same in every
case of contested action by the executive departments, which
would bring the whole government under the control of the
judiciary. Such a result would be at war with fundamental
principles of our institutions, and destroy their harmony and
usefulness. There is no authority for making the United States
a party defendant in a suit, except when conferred by statute..
The common law of Maryland *does not confer any such
power, nor is it found in any statute. The present proceeding
is, in substance and effect, a suit against the United States, and
intended as such. Its object is to assert a private right against
it, and compel payment out of the treasury; and it is, therefore,
unauthorized. McKim v. Odum, 3 Bland's Ch. R. 420- 423,

294

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guthrie.

424. Opinion of Attorney General 507- 510, 1066,1103,1303,
1425.
The treasury cannot be reached by compulsory proceedings
against its officer. A prosecution against him must be personal, and can affect him only, and cannot affect the property of the government; for a suit against him, the property of
the United States cannot be controlled. The court cannot
compel him to take its property and confer it upon another.
The property of a principal can never be taken in a suit against
the custodian or agent. If this could be done, a court could
compel A to take the property of B, and deliver it to C, to pay
a debt due from B to C. The power now set up has never been
vested in any judicial tribunal, nor lawfully exercised by one.
If sustained, it would enable the judiciary to control the operations of the treasury, and render the government powerless,
even in time of war, by directing its application.
The argument of Mr.Lawrence, in reply, was in substance
as follows :-

Two questions arise in this case, both of which are of great
importance: First, whether the President had power to remove
the relator, during the four years for which he was appointed;
and, secondly, if he had not, whether a mandamus is proper
for the purpose, and under the circumstances stated in the
petition.
I shall endeavor to maintain that the President, in this instance,
had not the power of removal. If we take the literal terms of
the law constituting the judges of Minnesota, they are peremptory and unmistakable. They " shall hold their offices for the
period of four years." If we refer to the commission .of the
relator, it pursues the very words of the law. The acceptance
of 'the office was upon the terms and conditions of the act of
congress and of the commission. Were there nothing then but
the act of congress involved in this case, it would be a waste
of words to argue that upon the language of that act the relator was entitled to hold his office for the entire term of four
years, subject only to the power of impeachment:
But the attorney-general contends that, no matter what may
be the construction of the act of congress, the executive power
is lodged in the President, by the constitution, -and that the
power of removal, being incident to the power of appointment,
which is an executive power, is itself therefore an executive
po' er, and consequently cannot be taken from the President, in
any case, by congress, and thiat the territorial judges not being
judges the tenure of whose office is defined by the constitution,
they were within the control of executive power; and that such
has been the construction of all departments of the government
from the beginning.

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

295

The United States v. Guthrie.

Now, sir, I maintain the- direct contrary of this doctrine. I
insist that congress has th6 power to define the tenure of any
office not defined and fixed by the constitution, and that this is
a matter of philosophical and political necessity arising from
the very nature of legislative functions. And that as to the
power of removal in the case of judicial officers, the executive,
legislative, and judicial construction has been against it
But before proceeding to the exact question involved, I wish
to notice the case of the American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1
Pet. 540, which has been made the groundwork of the supposed
power of removal in the case of territorial judges.

Now, all that the court decide in that case is, that the judges
of the territorial courts of Florida were not

"

constitutional

jadges," that is, that they were not judges of-those courts to
which the judicial power spoken of in the constitution was
committed, for if they had been they would have held their
office "during good behavior; " but. that they were legislatiVe
judges, created by virtue of the power given to congress to
make all needful regulations for the territory of the United

States.
But what countenance does this decision give to the power
of removal by the President? All that decision affirms is, that
territorial judges do not derive their existence from the constitution; if they did, they would necessariy hold their office during
good behavior, and congress could not limit or abridge their
term of office. In other words, if they are the judges designated
in the constitution, they hold their office during good behavior,
in spite of congress or the executive, because the constitution,
the instrument of their'existence, says so. But where in this
decision is found any warrant for holding that a legislative judge,
shall not hold his office during the 'term of four years, when the
act of congress, the instrument of his existence, says he shall
so hold'. The judges in either case are just hat the instrument
to which they owe their origin makes them in the one case,
during good behavior; in the other, during four years. And
it is no more within the power of iny third party to remove the
incumbent in the one case than in the other. In each case, the
President, by and-with the advice of the senate, has the power
of appointment. In each ease the power of appointment lihving been executed, the President is-.ftti his officio, the constitution in the one case, and the act of congress in the other,
clothing these officers with their respective powers, qualities,
and immunities.
There is another idea.which has been rather hinted than

expressed, that the judges of the territorial courts -are mere
executive officers, created under -the clause of the cnmtitution

which gives power to congress to. make rules respecting the
territory of the United States, and are thexefore not within the
saving influence which protects judicial officers. As I have not
seen this doctrine in the works of any respectable writer, or
heard it from the lips of any respectable speaker, I will only
say that if their character were not to be pronounced from the
nature of their functions, but from the character of the body to
which that power is committed, and from which they derive
their existence, then they are legislative officers, and not executive
officers, because it is to congress and not to the President, that
the power of making rules respecting the territory of the United
States has been committed.
I now come to the main question in the case. Can congress
create ai office and define the tenure thereof ? By the constitution all the legislative power of the federal government is
committed to congress, and by the last clause of the 8th section
of article 1, all the residuay or discretionary power of the general
government is also lodged in congress. The legislative is the
only -creative element in our government, and precedes in logical
succession as well as in actual experience the action of the
other departments, inasmuch as they only act upon that which
the legislative power has brought into existence. The functions
of the legislature are originative, those of the judiciary expository, and those of the President executory. The one gives
birth to that which the other expounds and explains, and the
third, when understood and explained, carries into effect. To
create an office, then, is in its nature a legislative function.
And to define and fix the tenure of an office which is in the
process of creation, is also in its nature a legislative function.
And of course it would be comprehended in the grant of "1all the
legislative power," unless expressly withheld, or impliedly denied
by the grant of some directly repugnant power to some other
department. And it is insisted by the attorney-general that the
grant of the executive power to the President is thus repugnant
to the power in congress to ,fix the tenure of an office.
But what is eiecutive power with reference to the government
of the United States ? It is not executive power in the abstract.
It is not the executive power of the Emperor of Morocco or the
Sultan of Turkey, but it is such executive power as rises out
of the constitution and laws of the United States. It is exactly
the power, in any given case, of carrying the particular law, as
it stands, into execution. In the instance of the judges of the
United States courts, the constitution having fixed the tenure,
the executive power consists in the power of appointment without the power of removal. So, too, where the legislatures from
great motive, of public policy, creates an office with a fixed and

determinate tenure, the executive power, as to that law, consists
in the power of appointment only, without the power of removai.
And this is the necessary result of the very structure of our
government. The sovereignty of the United States is an'unit.
The government of the United States is one government. The
departments are but functionaries of that government; not hostile to each other, but co~rdinate ; separate, but not antagonistical.
"When, therefore, either of the departments acts in its legitimate
sphere, it is the sovereignty.of the United States which acts
through its appropriate functionary. If congress pass an act, it
is the act of the government of the United States, by its appropriate organ. If the judiciary expound a statute, it- is the
exposition by the government through its peculiar organ, of its
own enactment. But the attorney-general says that he does
not recognize this "unitarian gbvernment;" that he looks into
the constitution of the United States,- and discovers only three
distinct and separate departments. Beyond that he does not
look.
This view of the case imposes upon me the inquiry, what is
a constitution? Is it the government, or is it the organic law
by which the government acts? Is it any thing else than a
charter, in which are laid down the functions, the powers, and
the duties of the mere organs or instrunents of the government?
In a pure democracy, a consitution is an absurdity. In an
absolute despotism, a constitution is an absurdity. Because, in
either case, the power which acts is absolute, and being the only
power which can make the constitution, it can disobey it or
annul it, and there.is nothing beyond it to impose on it the
necessity of obedience to its own rules. It is only in a representative government that a constitution properly finds a place.
It is only where the sovereign power does not immediately govern, but acts through others who represent that sovereign power,
that a constitution becomes necessaryin order to define how
far and in what the sovereign power is committed to such agents
or representatives. In so far as-the power is given to them,.their
acts are the acts of the sovereignty, but no further. There is
still a power behind the constitution~which, as it made it, can
also unmake it. And, sir, there is a sovereignty behind the constitution of the United States-a power which, as it made, can
unmake that. It is that sovereignty, that power, which is represented, not constituted, by the different departments as laid down
in the constitution. When, therefore, the congress passes an act
within its prescribed sphere, it is the soverignty of the United
States which passes that act by its appropriate department.
And so with the other branches of the government. I. repeat,
then, that the sovereignty of the United States is an uni and

that the different departments are but different organs of one
and the same government. And when "the executive power"
is committed to the President, it is, in any given case, only that
power which is necessary in order to carry the particular law
into execution. And instead of the grant of the executive power
being a limit to, or abridgment of, the legislative power, the
former is only a consequence or result of the latter, it being only
the power of carrying the law which the legislature has made, and
as it has made it, into execution. And such has been the construction practically. The great debate in 1789 has been misapprehended by the attorney-general, and by others before him. The
question involved in that debate was not whether the President
had the power of removing an officer, the tenure of whose office
was fixed by law; but whether he had such power when the
law was silent as to the tenure. The debate arose upon the
necessity of inserting the words, " to be removable by the President," &c., and it was argued that the power of removal was
incident to the power of appointment, where no statutory limitation existed, and that therefore it was unnecessary to insert those
words. But it was nowhere intimated that when the law fixed
the tenure the President could remove; or that congress, whenever public policy should require, could not effectually fix the
tenure of an office which it could create. On the contrary, it
was distinctly asserted by many, and treated as a concessum by
all, that congress could make the tenure what it pleased. The
debate, too, had reference to a purely executive office, and much
of it was spent upon the question, whether, if the power of removal was incident to that of appointment, the President and
senate, and not the President alone, should remove. And the
main argument for the President's power was his responsibility
for the acts of purely executive officers, who were his agents,an argument which could not extend to judicial officers. I
humbly sflibmit, then, that this great debate, instead of being a
foundation for the doctrine set up by the attorney-general, when
rightly understood, only goes to the. extent that an executive
officer, whose term of office is not limited by law, holds at the
pleasure of the President. And from that time to this, the executive construction has been that territorial judges could not be
removed, and they iave been treated as exempt from the President's power.
The legislative construction nas been the same. There has
been one uniform current of legislative acts, in which the tenure
of the territorial judges has been fixed. And it is not unworthy
of consideration that the very.congress of 1789, in about one
month after the debate I have referred to, gave their legislative
exposition sf. the power of congress to fix the tenure of office,

when they enacted, in the act passed to adapt the ordinance of
1787 to the constitution of the United States, that in all cases
where, under the ordinance, the congress had had the power of
removal, the President should thereafter have that power. 1 Stats.
at Large, 53. Now, the ordinance had limited the tenure of the
judges to good behavior, and of course the above act, therefore,
conferred no power on the President to remove them. And for
fifty years, through successive enactments, this policy as to judicial officers, has been followed by congress, and has been sanctioned -by the public sentiment in its favor.
The judicial construction has been the same. As long ago
as the case of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cra. 154, it was decided
that where the tenure of an office was fixed, the President had
no power over the officer. In that case, justices of the peace
were appointed by the President under the act of congress of
1801, by which act they were to hold their offices for five years.
The couirt decided that Marbury-, when once appointed, had a
right to the office for the five years prescribed by law, independent of the executive. The case is exactly analogous to the
present. In both, the tenure was fied, for a term of years, by
an act of congress. But how does the attorney-general deal
with this decision? Why, forsooth, he says it is an obiter dictum, not necessary to the decision of the case. But, sir, I maintain that it was in no just sense an obiter dictum. It was the very
case itself. It was ably argued, and solemnly considered and
decided by the whole court. But more than this, it has stood
unreversed for more than fifty years, and has, by reiterated reference and recognition, become embalmed in the jurisprudence of
the country. It has been woven into the very fabric of our
state and federal authority, and you might as well tear the woof
from the warp as to wrest this case from its place in the unwritten law of this land. And, -moreover, this court has again
recognized the same principle, in the case of Hennen, 13 Pet.
258,259. And I conclude, then, that not only is it philosophically
true that the legislative, which is the only creative, originative
department of the government, has th6 power to define and fix
that which it creates, and that the executive power is only the
United States executing that which the United States, by ita
congress, has enacted; but that, in relation to judicial officers, the
united construction of all the departments has rested in the
same conclusion.
IL The second question is, whether a mandamus is the
proper remedy?
If it is not, theft the relator, although illegally deprived of his
office and its emoluments, is utterly -ithout remedy; and not
.onIy may the executive officers of the government deprive an

individual of his rights, but may, in the very act, violate both
the constitution and the laws of the United States, and yet
this wrong cannot be remedied. For even an impeachment
does not restore the individual to his rights.
The fact, then, that the relator is without any other legal
remedy, is of itself good ground for a mandamus where the
right is clear. Tappan on Mandamus, pp. 5, 9, 10.
It is no objection that the mandamus is to compel the payment of money, if there are no other means of compulsion. 3
Nev. and Perry, 280; 8 Ad. and Ellis, 176; 4 Barn. and Ad.
360; 6 Bing. 668.
In the present case the act was purely ministerial; not a particle-of discretion was to be exercised. By the 11th section of
the act of congress, (9 Stats. at Large, 407,) each judge was to
receive an annual salary of $1,800, to be paid quarterly, at the
treasury of the United States. An appropriation has in each year
been made'for the payment of these judges. See 9 Stats. at
Large, 532, 611. The salary was fixed by law, the time of payment fixed, the place of payment fixed, and the money lay in
the treasury appropriated for that payment. Could there be a
more absolutely ministerial act or duty than that of the secretary in making the payment? See the case of Kendall, 12 Pet.
612, 613.
But the attorney-general says that the secretary of the treasury was, in this instance, to exercise judgment and discretion
in looking into the act, and determining its meaning. But
this is no more than saying that the act was addressed to a
being with intellectual faculties. For if no act can be ministerial merely because it requires to be understood in order to be
performed, then no act of a rational being can ever be ministerial. The true question is, not whether it requires judgment,
discernment, or any other intellectual quality, in order to understand what is to be done by the requirements of 4he statute,
but whether the officer has any discretion to exercise between
doing, and not doing, what the statute commands. If the
statute is imperative, there is no room for judgment as to the
performance of the act which the statute requires, however
much of judgment, in another sense, or of understanding may
be requisite in arriving at the meaning of the law. True legal
discretion is a discretion to do or not to do, according as the
judgment of the officer may decide; and that discretion can
never be exercised when the statute has peremptorily ordered a
thing to be done.
This case is clearly distinguishable from Paulding v. Decatur,
14 Pet 497, and Brashear v. Mason, 6 How. 92.
In each Pf those cases there was a fair case for discretion to

be exercised, both in regard to the real meaning of congress,
and, also, in regard to the fund out of which the money was to
be paid. Nor is this but an indirect mode of suing the government, which it is forbidden to do directly. This proceeding is
neither to establish a claim by the judgment of a court, nor to
enforce against the government the payment of a claim.
The government has, by its proper legislative department,
the only department which in this particular province represents the government, declared that the judges of the Minnesota territory shall, receive a certain salary, to be paid
quarterly at the treasury. It is the secretary of the treasury,
and not the government of the United States, that refuses to
pay; and the mandamus is to command him, not as the representative of the government to make this payment, but as the
mere officer on whom devolves the duty of executing this law,
which the government, by its legislature, has passed, to do what
the law specifically requires.

Mr. Justice DANIEL delivered the opinion of the court.
This case comes before us upon a writ of error to the circuit
court of the United States for the District of Columbia and
county of Washington. It originated in the denial, by th;
court above mentioned, of a writ of mandamus, by which the
secretary of the treasury should be ordered to pay to the relator
a sum of money claimed by th3 latter as a portion of the
salary due to him as chief justice of the territory of Min
nesota.
The facts which constituted the grounds of the application,
few and simple in their character, were these: That on the 19th of Mdrch, 1849, the relator had, with the
advice and consent of the senate, been commissioned, by President Taylor, chief justice of the supreme court of the territory
of Minnesota, to which office there had been annexed (by the
act of congress organizing the territorial government) a compensation or salary of eighteen hundred dollars per annum,
payable quarter-yearly. That the tenure of the appointment
was, by the language both of the act of congress, and of the
commission of the relator, declared to be for the -term and
duration of four years from the date of the commission. That
the relator, having accepted his commission was, afterwards,
namely, on 22d of October, 1851, informed by J. J. Crittenden, acting secretary of state, that the President had thought
it proper to remove him from office, and to substitute in his
place Jerome Fuller.
That the relator, insisting upon the tenure of his office according to the literal terms of the commission, preferred a

claim before the first auditor of the treasury for the sum of
$2,343, as compensation, from the period of his dismission,
up to the expiration of four years from the date of his appointment.
That the first auditor having rejected the claim in these words:
"That Aaron Goodrich is not entitled to the salary claimed by
him," an appeal was taken by the relator to the comptroller of
the treasury, by whom the decision of the first auditor was sustained, and by whom, in adjudging, it is remarked, that " There
can be only one chief justice of the supreme court in the territory; and the President of the United States having thought
proper to remove Chief Justice Goodrich, and having nominated, and, by and with the consent of the senate, appointed
Jerome Fuller chief justice, in the room and stead of the said
Chief Justice Goodrich, he, that is, the comptroller, was bound
to consider the said removal and appointment as legal." And in
consideration of the facts and the law, his decision was, that
the United States were not indebted to the said Aaron Goodrich, as chief justice of the supreme court of the territory of
Minnesota, and that the decision of the first auditor in the
premises was confirmed and established.
Upon the foundation of the facts above recited, and in opposition to the decisions of the auditor and comptroller, and with
the view of coercing the allowance, by the secretary of the
treasury, of the claim preferred 1Vy the relator, the application,
which has been refused by the circuit court, was made.
In considering this case, it may be remarked, at the threshold,
that it exhibits the anomalous predicament of a prosecution by
and in the name of the United States, adversary to the United
States and to their authority; for it must be admitted that the
secretary of the treasury can have no relation whatever, and is
clothed with no powers and sustains no obligation incident to
the present controversy, except as he is the representative of the
United States, or the guardian or custodian of their interests,
committed to his charge.
In their discussion of this cause, the counsel on either side
have deemed themselves called upon to take a more extensive
range of inquiry, than is that by which we consider this controversy to be properly limited. They have supposed that, in the
regular line of this controversy, and, therefore, in its correct
adjudication, were involved, necessarily, the tenure and character of the judicial power, as created either by the constitution
or by the legislation of congress; as likewise the powers of the
executive department, in the exercise of its constitutional functions, to control or influence the judicial power; and in their
examination, by the counsel, of these deeply-important topics,

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

much of research and ingenuity has been. evinced. But, within
what we conceive to be the correct apprehension of this cause,
neither of those important topics is embraced; and although,
when regularly and directly presented for consideration, the
responsibility of passing upon them can no more be avoided
than can the adjudication of any minor subject of- judicial cognizance, yet their very importance furnishes a cogent reason
why any unauthorized proceeding, in reference to them, should
be cautiously avoided; why there should be no attempt to affect
them by proceedings extrajudicial in their character, and such
as would deprive of binding authority the action of the court,
in matters even of trivial concernment.
The true question presented for our consideration here, relates
neither to the tenure of the judicial office, as created and defined
by the constitution or by acts of.congress, nor to the powers and
functions of the President, as vested with the executive power
of the government.
The only legitimate inquiry for our determination upon the
case before us is this: Whether, under the organization of the
federal government, *or by any known principle of law, there
can be asserted a power in the circuit court of the United States
for the .District of Columbia, or in this court, to command the
withdrawal of a sum or sums of money frora the treasury of
the United States, to be applied in satisfaction of disputed or
controverted clailais against the United States ? This is the
question, the very question presented for our determination;
statement would seem to carry with it the most
and its sim
startling considerations - nay, its unavoidable negation, 'unless
this should be prevented by some positive and controlling command; for it would occur, a priori, to every mind, that a
treasury, not fenced round or shielded by fixed and established
modes and rules of administration, but which could be subjected to- any number or description of demands, asserted and
sustained through the undefined and undefinable discretion of
the courts, would constitute a feeble and inadequate provision
for the great and inevitable necessities of the nation. The
government under such a regime, or, rather, under such an
absence of all rule, would, if practicable at all, be administered
not by the great departments ordained by the constitution and
laws, and guided by the modes therein prescribed, but by the
uncertain, and perhaps contradictory action of the courts, in
the enforcement of their views of private interests.
But the question proper for consideration here has not been
left for its solution upon theoretical reasoning merely. It has
already been authoritatively determined.
The power of the courts of the United States to command

304

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guthrie.

the performance of any duty., by either of the principal executive departments, or such as is incumbent upon any executive
officer of the government, has been strongly contested in this
court; and, in so far as that power may be supposed to have
been conceded, the concession h6s been restricted by qualifications, which would seem to limit it to acts or proceedings by
the officer, not implied in the several and inherent functions or
duties incident to his office; acts of a character rather extraneous, and required of the individual rather than of the functionary.
Thus it has been ruled, that the only acts to which the power
of the courts, by mandamus, extends, are such as are purely
ministerial, and with regard to which nothing like judgment or
discretion, in the performance of his duties, is left to the officer; but that, wherever the right of judgment or decision
exists in him, it is he, and not the courts, who can regulate its
exercise.
These are the doctrines expressly nled by this court, in the
case of Kendall v. Stockton, 12 Pet. 524; in that of Decatur v.
Paulding, 14 Pet. 497; and in the more recent case of Brashear
v. Mason, 6 How. 92; principles regarded as fundamental and
essential, and apart from which the administration of the government would be impracticable. These principles, just stated,
are clearly conclusive upon the case before us. The secretary
of the treasury is inhibited from directing the payment of
moneys not specifically appropriated by law. Claims against
the treasury of the United States, like the present, are, according to the organization of that department, to be examined by
the first auditor; from this officer they pass, either under his
approva or by appeal from him, to the comptroller; and from
the latter they are carried before the secretary of the treasury,
without whose approbai 6n they cannot be paid, and who cannot, even by the cci aurring opinions of the inferior officers of
the department, be deprived of his own judgment upon the
justice or legality of demands upon public money confided to
his care. Opposed to the claim under consideration, we have
the decisions of three different functionaries; to each of whom
has been assigned, by law, the power and the duty of judging
of its justice and legality. By what process of reasoning, then,
the authority to make those decisions, or those decisions themselves, can be reconciled or identified with the performance of
acts merely ministerial, we are unable to conceive; and unless
so identified, or there could have been shown some power in
the-circuit court competent to the repealing of the legislation
by congress, in the organization of the treasury department competent, too, to the annulling of the explicit rulings of this

court in the cases hereinbefore cited-the circuit court could
have no jurisdiction to entertain the application for a writ of
mandamus in this instance. As 'no such powe has been shown,
nor, in our opinion, could have been. shown, or ever had existence, the decision of the circuit dourt, overruling the application,
is approved and affirmed.
Mr. Justice McLEAN dissented. Mr. Justice CURTIS filed
a separate opinion; in which Mr. Justice NELSON, Mr. Justice GRIER, and Mr. Justice CAMPBELL concurred.
Mr. Justice CURTIS.
I assent to the judgment of the couft in this case, upon the
ground that a writ of mandamus to the secretary of. the treasury
is not a l(gal remedy, to try the title of the relator to the office
claimed by him; and that, until that title has been legally tried
and determined, he can take no step to compel the payment of
the salary attached by law to that office. I desire to be understood as expressing no opinion upon any other question argued
by the counsel in this case.
Mr..Justice NELSON, Mr. Justice GRIER, and Mr. Justice
CAMPBELL concurred in this opinion.
Mr. Justice McLEAN..
As this case involves important principlks, and as I differ from
the opinion of the court, I shall state my views.
The first inquiry that naturally arises in the case is, whether
'the President. hd power to make the removal complained of ?
This is not the object of the mandamus applied for, but it is,
incide'ital to it.
The 2d section of the 2d article of the constitution provides:
"That the President shall have power, by and with the advice
and consent of the senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public
ministers and consuls, judges of the supreme court and all
other oflcers of the United States, whose appointments are not
herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by
law.)
In his argument, the attorney-general says: "That the power
of the President was discussed and settled by congress, in the
commencement of the federal government; that the power of
the President to remove all officers, who, by the constitution
itself, were not declared to hold their offices during good behavior, was sustained by both houses; and that this power was
recognized in the establishment of the department for foreign
affairs,"

806

SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. Guthrie.

In the 2d section of the act referred to it was provided:
When the principal officer of the department should be removed, the chief clerk, during the vacancy, shall have custody
of the records of the department And a similar provision is
contained in the other acts to establish the principal departments of the government. The heads of these departments
constituted the cabinet of the President; and, as they were not
only his advisers, but discharged their duties under his direction, there was a peculiar propriety that their offices should be
held at the will of the executive.
There was great contrariety of opinion in congress on this
power. With the experience we now have, in regard to its exercise, there is great doubt whether the most enlightened statesmen would not come to a different conclusion.
The attorney-general calls this a constitutional power. There
is no such power given in the constitution. It is presumed to
be in the President, from the power of appointment. This presumption, I think,, is unwise and illogical. The reasoning is:
the President and senate appoint to office; therefore, ihe President may remove from office. Now, the argument would be
legitimate, if the power to remove were inferred to be the same
that appoints.
It was supposed that the exercise of this power by the President, was necessary for the efficient discharge of executive
duties. That to consult the senate in making removals, the
same as in making appointments, would be too tardy for the
cortection of abuses. By a temporary appointment the public
service is now provided for ih case of death, and the same provision could be made where immediate removals are necessary.
The senate,,when called to fill the vacancy, would pass upon
the demerits of the late incumbent.
This, I have never doubted, was the true construction of the
constitution, and I am able to say it was the opinion of the late
supreme court, with Marshall at its head.
The -numbers of the Federalist though written before the constitution was adopted, have been considered as among its ablest
expositors. Publius, in one of his numbers, says, "It has been
mentioned as one of the advantages to be expected from the
codperation of the senate, in the business of appointments, that
it would contribute to the stability of the administration. The
consent of that body would be necessary'to displace as well as
appoint. A change of the chief magistrate, therefore, would not
occasion so violent or so great a revolution in the. offices of the
government, as might be expected if he were the sole disposer
of offices: where a man in any station has given satisfactory
evidence of his fitness for it, a new President would be restrained

from attempting a change in favor of a person more agreeable
to him, by the apprehension that the discountenance of- the
senate might frustrate the attempt, and bring some degree of
discredit upon himself. Those who can best estimate the value
of a steady administration, will be most disposed to prize a provision which connects the official existence of public men, with
the approbation or disapprobation of that body which, from the
greater permanency of its own composition, will in all probability be less subject to inconstancy than any other member of
the body."
In this discussion, in congress Mr. Madison, one of the ablest
and most enlightened statesnien of which our country can
boast, considered the removal from office was an executive
power, and that congress could not restrict its exercise. He
also considered the power of appointment an executive power,
and that, had not the constitution so provided, the concurrent
action of the senate could not have been required by act of congress in making appointments. If this were admitted, it would
not give strength to the argument in favor of the exercise of the
power-by the President.
If the power to remove from office be inferred from the power
to appoint, both the elements of the appointing power are necessarily included. The constitution has declared' wvhat shall be
the executive power to' appoint, and by consequence, the same
power should be exercised in a removal. But this power of
removal has been, perhaps, too long established and exercised
t6 be now questioned. The voluntary action of the senate and
the 'President, would be necessary to change the practice ; and as
this would require the relinquishment of a power by one of the
parties, to be exercised in conjunction with the other, it can
scarce'y be expected.
The Attorney-general says, that "the construction of the constitution concurred in by the two houses of the first congress
and approved by President Washington, resolved, among others,
the following point "That in a republican government, public offices are created
for the benefit of the people; that the officer does not hold a
private estate and property in the office, and when the officer is
unfit, for any cause whatever, he ought to be displaced, and
another appointed for the benefit of the people and their security;
or if the office itself be found, upon experience, to be unnecessary, it should be abolished." The soundness of the policy expressed in this resolution, must be adinitted by every intelligent
individual who understands and appreciates our system of
government; and if the power had been exercised under the
limitations expressed in the- resolution, it would have had a'

the truth of this a reference may be made to the history of the
earlier administrations.
But this power of removal from office by the President, was
neither exercised nor supposed to apply until recently, to the
judicial office.
In the establishment of the territories, the "Northwestern,"
Indiana," "Illinois," " IVississippi," " Michigan," and " Wisconsin," it was provided that the judges should hold their offices
during good behavior, The governor, secretary, and the other
officers of these territories were appointed, under the law, for a
term of years, " u nless sooner removed."
By the act of congress of August, 1789, to provide for the
government of these territories, certain changes were made in
the ordinance of 1787, to adapt it to the constitution of the
United States. It was provided that the President shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent-of the senate,
shall appoint, all officers which by the said ordinance were to
have been appointed by the United States in congress assembled; and all officers so appointed shall be commissioned by
him; and all cases where the United States, "in congress
assembled, might, by the said ordinance, revoke any commission or remove from any office, the Yresident is hereby declared
to have the same power of revocation and removal."
In the territories of "New Orleans," "Florida," " Iowa," "Oregon," "Washington," "Utah," " New Mexico," " Minnesota,"
" Nebraska," and" Kansas," the judges were appointed for four
years; and the governor and all other officers of the territories
were appointed for a term of years, "unless sooner removed."
In the " Missouri" and " Arkansas" territories only, were the
judges appointed for four years, "if not sooner removed."
In the constitution, no express provision was made for the
government of territories. This, no doubt, was deemed unneccessary, as the ordinance of 1787, which was passed before the
constitution was adopted, provided for the government of all
the territory then claimed by the United States.
Territorial judges are said not to be appointed under the constitution, but by virtue of an act of congress. In the American
Insurance Company v. Canter, 1 Pet. 46, Chief Justice Marshall
said: " The judges of the superior courts of Florida held their
offices for four years. These courts, then, are not constitutional
courts, in which the judicial power, conferred by the constitution on the general government, can be deposited." But all the
judges of the territories, from 1787 to 1804, were appointed for
good behavior, so that the term of service was not 4 safe criterion by which to determine the character of territorial judges.

DECEMBER TE*RM,

1854.

The United States v. Guthrie.

It is admitted that the judges of the supreme court cannot
be appointed for a less period than good behavior; and the
same may be said of the district judges.
The power under which the territorial governments is organized, is a matter of some controversy. In the case above cited,
Chief Justice Marshall said: "Florida continues to be 'territory
of the United States, governed by virtue of that clause in the
constitution which empowers congress to make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States." This is the prevailing view
of those who have examined the subject. But the chief justice
proceeds: "Perhaps the power of governing a territory belonging
to the United States, which has not, by becoming a State,
acquired the means of self-government, may result necessarily
from the facts that it is not within the jurisdiction of any particular State, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the
United States. These facts exist in every territorial government,
but it does not show the source of the power, unless by the
doctrine of necessity, which does not seem to be a legitimate
foundation for a civil government under our system. The
chief justice further says: " The right to govern may be the
inevitable consequence of the right to acquire territory." There
is no special power given in the constitution to acquire territory.
This does not seem to have been .within the view of the framers
of the government; and the right -was much contested in the
acquisition of Louisiana, when the power was first exercised.
It seems to me that the power to govern a territory'is a necessary consequence of the power given "to make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States."

No one doubts the power of

congress to sell the public lands beyond the limits of any State;
and this renders necessary the organization of a governnent for
the protection of the persons and property of the purchasers.
This is an implied power, but it necessarily results from the
power to sell the Public lands.
It is difficult to say that any power can be exercised by congress, which is not derived from the constitution. Without
that instrument, it is as powerless as any other association of
men. The laws of the Union protect our coifnerce wherever
the flag of the country may float, and, insome instances, our
own citizens may be made responsible for acts done in foreign
seas and countries; but this is the exercise of powers given by
the constitution. Under the legislative power of congress, territorial governmen'ts are organized, and their functionaries are
appointed by the President and senate. Their laws enmanate
from congress, or are passed by a territorial legislature, subject

to the approval of congress. The government of the territory
is a government of the United States; and although its courts
do not exercise the judicial power to -the same extent as the
other courts of the United States, still, they are courts of the
United States, and exercise such judicial powers as are conferred
on them by law.
It is argued that, as the President is bound to see the laws
faithfully executed, the power to remove unfaithful or incompetent officers is necessary. This may be admitted to be a
legitimate argument, as commonly applied to executive officers.
My own view is, that-the power to see that the laws are faithfully executed, applies chiefly to the giving effect to the decisions
of the courts when resisted by physical force. But however
strongly this may refer to the political officers of the government,
how can it apply to the judicial office?
In the nature of his office, the President must superintend
the executive department of the government. But the judiciary
constitutes a co6rdinate branch of the government, over which
t'he-President has no superintendence, and can exercise no control. So far from this department being subject to the executive,
t may be called to pass on the legality of his acts. The
President, like all the other officers of the government, is subject
to the law, and cannot violate it with impunity. He is responsible for the infraction of private rights, and before a territorial
court, the same as before the other courts of the Union. In no
just and proper sense can the President be required to see
that the judicial power shall be carried out, except as controlling
the physical power of the Union.
The effects of the control of the judicial, by the executive
power, are seen in the history of England, during the reign of
the Stuarts. The most insupportable tyranny and. corruption
were realized under this paramount power. of the executive
government. It has always been the corrupting power of all
free government This, in a great degree, arises from the extent
of its powers and patronage. And in the formation of our
government great care was taken to place the judicial power on
an independent basis. Being without patronage, and discharging the most onerous and delicate duties, nothing but a high
and an impartial discharge of its functions can sustain it.
Whenever any portion of the judicial power shall become
subject to the executive, there will be an end of its independence and purity. It will become the register of executive decrees
and of a party policy. What could create a deeper degradation than to see any branch of the judiciary, which stands
between the executive power and the rights of the citizen,
become the mere instrument of that power.

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

The United States v. Guthrie.

There can be little or no difficulty in coming to a correct
conclusion 6n this important question, by an examination of
the acts of congress creating the tenure of the judicial office
in the territories. In the seven territories first enumerated, the
judges were appointed during good beha-ior; the other officers
were appointed for a term of years, "if not sooner removedY"
In ten territories the law authorized the appointment of judges
for the term of four years, and the other officers, for a term of
years, "if not sooner removed." WVhether in the above acts the
judicial tenure was fixed for good behavior or a term of years,
no one call fail to see the difference in regard to the tenure of
the judges, and of the other officers. The judges were appointed
absolutely for good behavior, or a term of years, whilst the other
officers were appointed for a term of years, "unless sooner removed." By the terms of the appointment the political officers,
such as the governor, secretary, marshal, &c., were removable,
but the judges,were not. In this respect these appointments
9tand in contrast, and show the unmistakable intention of
congress.
It is true that for the territories of Missouri, and Arkansas,
the judges were appointed for the term of four Years, "unless
sooner removed." This language was first used for the .Missouri
territory, and as the Arkansas territory was taken from Missouri,
the same language was incorporated into the organic law of
Arkansas. These two territories out of the nineteen above
named, would imply the power to remove the judges. But
whether this language was the result of accident or design, it
cannot authorize the construction of the law establishing the
other territories, among which the territory of Minnesota is
included, as though the power of removal applied to them. The
words used will not allow. this ebnstruction, especially when
taken in connection with the words in the same acts in relation
to the appointment of officers in the territories, other than the
judges.
This view is greatly strengthened by the usage of the government. There have been, it is believed, but two judges of ierritories removed, and those recently, since the organization of the
Union. -ind we may rely on the early practice of the government, to show its true theory, in the exercise of federal powers.
The great principles of our system were ihen understood and
adhered to, and our safest axioms are found in this part of our
history.
It is said the act of 1789, which modified the ordinance of
1787, so as to adapt it to the conititution. gave the same power
to the Presideht, iii regard to appointments and removals which,
under the confederation, was exercised by congress. This is*

true, but it can apply only to those officers which, under the
confederation, were removable by congress. Under the ordinance, as above stated, the judges were appointed during good
behavior, while all the other officers were appointed for a term
*of years, "unless sooner removed."
If congress have the power to create the territorial courts,
of which no one doubts, it has the power to fix the tenure of
office. This being done, the President has no more power to
remove a territorial judge, than he has to repeal a law. The
duties of a judge of a territory are discharged as independently,
and as free from executive control, as are the duties of a judge
of this court. This territorial judicial power was intended to be
a check upon the executive power. And it would be inconsistent with the principles of our government, for the judges to be
subject to removal by the executive.
This is a great question, although it can only effect, as now
maintained, the territorial bench. And I regret that, from the
want of jurisdiction, in the opinion of my brethren, they are not
reqiured to express an opinion as to the power asserted.
The other question in the case is, whether the remedy by
mandamus is appropriate and legal. In the case of Kendall v.
the United States, 12 Pet. 608, which, in my judgment, is not
distinguishable from this, the question was settled.
In that.case, under a special act of congress, a matter of controversy between William B. Stokes et al. and the postmastergeneral, was referred to a commissioner, to examine the account
and report any balance he might find due to the relators, from
the post-office department; and the postmaster-general was
required to pay such balance, by entering a credit on the. books
of the department.
The duties of the commissioner were performed, and he
reported in favor of the relators, $161.563.89, all of which
.sum was credited by the postmaster-general, except the sum of
$39,462.43, which he refused to place to the credit of the

prayed the circuit court of the District of Colufiibia to award
a mandamus, directed to the postmaster-general, commanding
him to enter the credit.
A peremptory mandamus was issued by the circuit court,
which decision was brought before this court by a writ of error.
All the members of this court held, that it was a proper case
for mandamus, as the duty imposed was ministerial and positive, there being no other adequate remedy. Three only of the
judges dissented, on the ground that the circuit court of the
District of Columbia had not power to issue the writ; but the
other six judges held, that it was not only a case for a mandamus, bt that the circuit court had the power to issue it.

DF-CEMBER TERM, 1854.

Guthrie.

The credit was required to be entered on the books of the
auditor of the post-office department, whose duties were performed under the treasury department. But as the accounts
were ' examined in the post-office department, the credit was
required to be entered by the postmaster-general on the books
of the auditor. It was known that an order of the postmastergeneral, requiring the credit to be entered, would be obeyed by
the auditor.
In the case before us, the salary of the judge was fixed by
law, and payable at the treasury department, where application for payment has -been frequently made by the relator, and
refused by the secretary of the treasury. It is shown that an
appropriation of the salary was made by act of congress, and
in such a case the payment is a mifiisterial act, and the secretary has no discretion to withhold it. This -would notfbe controverted, it is supposed, if the judge, who demanded pay.
ment, had remained in office. If, in such case, the secretary
may, at his discretion, refuse to pay the salaries of officers, he
might suspend the action of the government. The duty to pay
is enjoined on the secretary by law; it is a ministerial duty, in
which he can exercise no discretion, the appropriation having
been made by law.
By the act of 2d September, 1789, the secretary of the
treasury is recuired, to " grant all warrants for moneys to be
issued from the treasury in pursuance of appropriations by
law." And, in the same act, the treasurer is requiied to "receive and keep the moneys of the United States, and to disburse
-the same upon warrants drawn by the secretary of the treasury,
countersigned by the comptroller, recorded by the register, and
not otherwise."
These are all ministerial duties, performed
under the secretary of the treasury. The money having been
appropriated by law for the salary of the judge, the sedretary
was bound to pay it.
The justification for the non-payment by the secretary is,
that the relator had been removed from office by the President,
and that, by the President and senate, his successor had been
appointed, who, having efitered upon'the discharge of his
duties, was entitled to the salary, and to whom it had been
paid.
If the act of removal by the President was unauthorized, this
can affbrd no justification for withholding the salary. It is admitted that, by mandamus, no act of an executive officer can
be examined, which invades the exercise of his judgment or
discretion. The payment of the salary, being a mere ministerial duty,. positively enjoined by law, is subject to no such
objection. But, may not the objection apply to the removal of

the judge? If such a power were within the exercise of the
discretion of the President, it would be conclusive. But if the
act be without authority and against law, it is void; and such
was the act complained of. The President could exercise no
discretion on the subject; the removal was beyond his power,
and the act being void, it cannot be considered as the exercise
of an executive discretion. The judgment and discretion
which may not be interfered with, by mandamus, must be in
the discharge of executive duties. These do not come within
the judicial power. But an unlawful, and consequently void
act, by the President, by which an injury is done to an individual, cannot be covered by executive discretion. And in
this case the question is incidental to the object of the mandaius, which is to require the secretary to perform a ministerial
duty. The removal of the judge is set up by the secretary as
a reason why the relator has not been paid; and if the act
of removal be void, it fails to justify the refusal to pay.
The case of Decatur v. Paulding, 14 Pet. 513, is altogether
different from the one under consideration. In the opinion of
the court in that case, the chief justice showed that it was
materially distinguishable from Kendall's case.
It would be difficult to imagine a clearer case for mandamus
than the one before us, in my judgment; and I think it should
be issued. If the salary has been paid to the new judge, it has
been illegally paid, and that is no reason why it should not
be paid to the rightful claimant.
We have nothing to do with the conduct of the judge, nor
had the President. The judge was liable to be impeached and
removed from office, in that form.
