EDWARD AL WEST,

.PLAINTIFF IN ERROR,

V.

JOSEPH COCHRA.n.*

The act of congress passed on the 3d of March, 1807, (2 Stats. dt Large, 441,) ap.

pointing commissioners to adjudicate land claims against the United States, requirec
that where titles to tracts of land, which had not-been previously surveyed, were
confirmed by the board, they should be sifrveyed under the directions of the surveyor-general. When a certificate and plat should be filed in the proper office, a

-patent certificate was to issue, vhich should entitle the claimant to a patent from

the United States.
Therefore, where conflicting locations were claimed of two concessions granted by the
lieutenant-governor of Upper Louisiana, and no survey satisfactory to the publik.
officers was made until 1852, when a patent was issued in conformity with a survey
directed by the secretary of the interior, this patent was conclusive, in a court of
law, ' the location to which the party was entitled.

He could ilot, in an action of ejectment, sustain a claim that his patent ought to have

had a different location, upon the ground that the confirmation by the commissioners conferred a perfect title to different land from that covered by the patent.

THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from the circuit
court of the United States for the district of Missouri.
It was an action of ejectment, brought by West a citizen of
the State of Illinois, against Cochran, a citizen of Missouri, for
all that tract or parcel of land situated in the city and county of
St. Louis, in said district, and which tract or parcel of land is
described as follows: L6t number one hundred and three, (103,)
in block number three hundred and twenty-one, as the said lot
is laid down and numbered on the map of the said city, and is
bounded on the east by Second-street beginning at the southMr. JusTICE WxAxnE, having been indisposed, did not sit in this cause.

west side of Second-street, eighty feet, more or less, from Chambers-street; thence westwardly on a line parallel with Chambersstreet, one hundred and fifty feet to an alley; thence northwardly eighty feet to Chambers-street; thence east-vardly along
the south side of Chambers-street one hundred and fifty feet, to
the place of beginning.
West claimed under the reservation made by Brazeau in his
deed to Labeaume, and under the confirmation of Brazeau's
title by the board of commissioners on the 22d of September,
1810.
Pochran claimed under a similar confirmation of the same
date to La Beaume. The patent for Brazeau's claim did not
include the land in dispute, whilst the patent for Labeaume's
claim did include it; and the question was, whether West, claiming under Brazeau's title, could show that the patent had been
erroneously located, and could claim under the confirmation.
The circuit court decided against West, and he brought the
case up to this court by a writ of error. The case is particularly
stated in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by Mr. Blair and Mrh. Ewig, for the plaintiff
in error, and by Mr. Hill and fr. CustiVg, (attorney-general,)
for the defendant in error.
The following notice of the point upon which the decision of
the court turned, is taken from the brief of IMr. Ewing, one
of the counsel for the plaintiff in error: The court, on the trial of this cause below, instructed the jury
that these surveys and patents were conclusive as to both the
parties; that neither of them was at liberty to reject and set up
a claim against .them, or otherwise than under them. To this
the plaintiff excepted.
We claim that the court erred in this instruction, and on this
arises the first and most important question in the case.
Brazeau claims under a confirmation by the United States
commissioners, pursuant to the act of March 3, 1807. Now, if
that confirmation passes the legal title, or if it creates an equity
or inchbate legal title to the land confirmed, the instruction of
the court was wrong, and the judgment must be reversed; and
we contend1. That the confirmation passes the absolute legal title; and
though a patent may issue, it is merely evidence of a title already
complete under the law. 2 Stats. at Large, 441, ยง 4.
The operative words of the statute are: " Which decision of
the commissioners, when in favor of the claimant, shall be final
against the United States, any act of congress to the contrary
notwithstanding."

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

405

West v. Cochran.

Here the claimant had an imperfect title. The United States
confirms it by her commissioners, and declares that this award
of confirmation shall be final dgainst her.
It seems to have been the intent, that the confirmation by the
conunissioners in this case should stand in the place of a confirmation by congress, under the act of 1805, ch. 26, (2-Stats. at
Large, 324.)
The act of 1805 provides, (section 5,) that such "decisions
shall be laid before congress in the manher hereinafter directed,
and be subject to their determination thereon."
The act of 1807 does not submit the case to the action of
congress, but declares that the decision of .the commissioners,
when in favor of tile claimant, "shall be final against time United
States."
The confirmation is complete, in the one case, with the action
of congress on each particular claim; in the other, by the action
of the commissioners without the action of congress. In both
cases a patent is to issue; but in. one of these cases the legal
title passes without the patent. Doe v. Eslava, 9 How. 446, 447-;
Stoddard v.Chambers, 2 lb. 307.
Why does it not pass in time other? The confirmation is
complete, the act of the commissioners final. Why does not the
legal title pass?
There can be no reason of policy or convenience against it,
which does not apply equally to confirmations by congress;
there is no technical difficulty, for the United States can as well
pass titles by the act of commissioners as by the act of the President; by an entry in the books of commissioners, returned to and
recorded in.the general land-office, as by a patent so recorded.
The reasons of policy are, indeed, against a- distinction between the two classes of cases, that the legal title should pass
at once to the individual in the one case, and remain in the
United States in the other.
It is exceedingly inconvenient in practice to treat *titlesderived
from the sovereign as equities. There is no ordinary process by
which a perfect title can be compelled, and the claimant is made
a suitor to a ministerial or executive officer, and in cases of con-.
test such officer may greatly influence, if lie cannot control, time
judicial determination of the rights of parties litigant.
It is entirely -within the competence of congress to -pass title
by other modes than by patent, and by other ofiicers than those
of the general land-office. In this case, confusion is guarded
against by the required report of the commissioners. On that,
the general land-office must issue a patent, if req ired, precisely
as they must in cases confirmed by direct act of congress, and
'for the same purpose. No more discretion is left it intile one
case than in the other.

SUPR'EME
West v.

COURT.

Cochran.

There is a dictum in Burgess v. Gray, 16 How. 63, opposed
to our view on this point, which we respectfully ask the court to
reconsider. The point to which the dictum applies, does not
necessarily arise in the case. But if we are wrong as to the
effect of the confirmation, and if the actual legal title have not
passed to us, we may, under the statutes of Missouri, adopted
in practice by the circuit court, maintain our action of ejectment
under the confirmation.
We sue at law, instead of suing in equity, and have the same
relief in the one forum as in the other; and this suit was brought
when neither party had a patent; and even if Labeaume had
obtained a patent, we suppose a patent issued to him of our
lands, to which he had no color of right, would be void as
against us.
Now, whether our title be perfect or inchoate, such as it is, it
is "final" against the United States. It is conclusive and absolute, - subject to no conditions or contingencies. The land
confirmed to Brazeau belongs to him; the United States could
not take it from him, nor transfer it, in title, to another. The
only question is as to locality. That may be agreed upon between the officers of the government and the claimant, and the
agreement attested by the issuing and acceptance of a patent.
But in case of controversy, the question, as to existing title, is
not for the executive department, but for the courts. This was
practically denied by the instructions. The court charged the
jury that the surveys and patents made by order of the secretary
were conclusive, as well in the case in which the patent was
refused as that in which ifwas accepted.
AR.B. A. Hill made the following points upon the propositions considered by the court: 1. The act of the 3d of March 1807, under which Brazeau's
representative claims title, through a confirmation by the first
board of commissioners, did not proprio vip-ore, vest the title in
Brazeau ; it was subject to the action (f congress, and to the
condition of survey. Section 5 of the act of Marnh 2, 1805, ยง3,
of the act of February 28, 1806, and ยงยง 6 and 8 of the said act
of 1807, require reports of the board of commissioners, to the
secretary of the treasury, and he was required to report the
same to congress. These reports were to contain a description
of each tract confirmed. ยง 6 of 1807. Congress never confirmed the reports made by the said board; for the reason that no
description of the land confirmed was contained in the reports.
See State Papers, Public Lands, vol. 2, p. 560. The reports
were therefore to be perfected into grants of the fee, in accordance with other provisions of the act of 1807; there being no
words of present grant in the said act.

DECEMBER TERM1, 1854.
West v. Cochran.

2. By section 6 of said act of 1807, the title -old pass by a
survey madg6 by the United States and a patent; and section 7
authorized a patent to issue upon a recorded Spanish survey.
These are the only mreans by which a title. coild pass under
said act of 1807. The fee remained in the United States until
the performance of the said conditions; and congres-'so construed the said acts of 1805, 1806, and 1507, by expressly excepting the confirmation by the first board of commissioners
from the operation of the act of 13th of June, 1312, whieh passed
an absolute title by words of present grant, to certain claims
possessed in Spanish times.
3. Brazeau's confirmation never having been confirmed by
congress, and his tract never having been surveyed by the Spanish government, was subject to the condition f Aurvey by the
United States; which was the necessary foundation for a patent; and until that survey was made and the patent issued, the
title did not pass. This is the form of the rant. It was a
grant to be located by the United States, and no land was granted to him until the location. The survey by the United States
was, therefore, a necessary part of the grant. It was so under the
Spanish lav. The orders of O'Reily and Morales, in force when
Brazeau's Spanish grant was made, required a Spanish survey
by the proper officer, as the condition upon which the grant was
to be made. The analogy between the Spanish law and the act
of 1807 is complete. The one provides for an approved 'survey
to be annexed to and to form a part'of the grant; the other for
a patent certificate to be issued upon an approved survey, as the
foundation for a patent.
4. The United States acted in the capacity- of a sovereign in
the granting of lands claimed before the board under the said
act of 1807. The claimants had no standing in court. They
were required to procure a grant from the United States to perfect the title. The only right or title that plaintiff' can claim,
must be derived under the act of 1807. If it operate as a grant,
it can only so operate in pursuance of the conditions aniexed
to it.
5. The said act is peremptory. It provides that a survey shall
be made by the United States, if a Spanish one is not already
made and recorded; that a plat thereof shall be made: that a
patent certificate shall issue thereon, and a patent. -The title
was to pass in accordance with these forms. This construction
is in accordance with the manifest intent of the statute. The
United States had purchased a vast territory, portions of which,
along the rivers and in the mineral regibns, were covered by private claims and settlement rights, not perfected into /rants under the Spanish government. The treaty with France, by which

408

SUPREME COURT.
West v. Cochran.

it was acquired, imposed the obligation upon us to protect the
inhabitants of the territory in the enjoyment of their property.
To do this it was necessary to ascertain the extent of that property. Where Spanish surveys were not made, official surveys
by the United States were the means necessary to accomplish
that object. The United States was in debt, and this newlyacquired domain was held in trust for the people, and the lands
were to be used for sale and settlement. The public lands could
not be subdivided and sold until the private claims were settled
and located. The lawful power was vested in the United States
to accomplish these objects, and the act of 1807 was designed
to do so. The spirit and intent of the law is to separate the
private claims fr-om the public domain; but this has not been
accomplished unless the United States reserved the power to
survey the unsurveyed confirmations made by the old board, and
fix their locality. It is for these reasons that this court has held
that a confirmation by said board did not vest the legal title.
Burgess v. Gray, 16 How..63; 7 Pet. 85, 93; 2 How. 374;
16 lb. 500, 1; 4 Pet. 342; 10 How. 373. If the legal title
vested by the inherent force of the act, as it did under the
act of 13th June, 1812, it could not be devested by a survey;
but there was no title vested by the act of 1807 until a patent
issued upon an approved survey. The United States survey
for Brazeau is therefore conclusive, and the plaintiff cannpt claim
title to any land not embraced within it, and the land in controversy not being included within the survey of his confirmation,
he cannot recover.
i\Ir: Justice CATRON delivered the opinion of the court.
To uiderstand the application of the instruction given to the
jury which controlled the verdict in this case, a minute statement of the facts is necessary.
On the 1st June, 1794, Joseph Brazeau, by petition, requested the Lt. Governor of Upper Louisiana to grant to him a t-act
of land near to the then village of St. Louis, "situated beyond
the foot of the mound called the Grange de Terre, four arpens
in width, which are to extend from the steep bank or beach of
the _Mississippi in the W.'- S. W. by about twenty arpens in
depth, that shall begin at the foot of the hill where stands the
Grange de Terre, ascending in a N. N. W. corse to the vicinity of the Stony Creek, so that the said tract hereby asked for be
bounded on the east by the bank of the Mississippi, on the other
side in part by the king's domain, and in part by land reunited
to the said domain."
The grant was made by the governor in the following terms:
"We do certify to have put Joseph Brazeau in possession of

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.

409

West v. Cochran.

the parcel of land designated in his petition, of four arpens by
twenty deep, which shall extend in a N. N. W. course from the
foot of the hill where stands the Grange de Terre, ascending to
the vicinity of the Stony Creek, bounded on one side by the
bank of the Mississippi, and on the opposite side by lands not
conceded or reunited to his Majesty's domain, and at the two
ends bounded on the N. N. W. by the vicinity of the Rocky
Creek, and at the other, in the S. S. E., shall be bounded by the
land granted to the free mulattress Esther." This concession
was made June 10, 1794.
On the 25th of the same month, the governor amended his
former concession, in which he declares that the four arpens
front by twenty deep, "shall begin beyond the mound called La
Grange de Terre, extending N. N. W. to the vicinity of the
Rocky Branch, bounded on one side by the banks of the Mississippi River, and on the opposite side by lands reunited to the
king's domain, through which lands passes this present concession, of which one end is to be bounded by the concession of
the free mulattress Esther."
The application of Esther above referred to, was made October 2, 1793. She petitioned for a piece of land lying on the
borders of the Mississippi; the northern- portion of the concession to be situate between the small mound called the Grange
de Terre and the beach of the Mississippi, having at its two extremities four arpens front, that shall bear about from E. N. E.
to W. S. W., by twenty arpens in extent or depth, that shall
run from about N. N. W. to S. S. E.
On the 3d October, 1793, the governor granted the land to
Esther, in the terms of her petition, with this addition: That
the land should descend the river, and be limited on three
sides by the king's domain, and on the other side by the bank
of the Mississippi, as shown by the plat on the back of the concession. This plat was a rude sketch, affording no material aid
in locating the land.
On the 5th of October, 1793, the governor certifies that he
had in person put Esther in possession of the land granted, the
locality of which he again describes, in th6 terms as above set
forth, except that he declares that the eastern boundary on the
river shall be limited by the edge of the beach.
Esther's concession was not surveyed by the Spanish authorities.
On the 9th of lay, 1798, Joseph Brazeau sold to Louis Labeaume part of the land granted to Brazeau in June, 1794,
reserving for himself four arpens to be taken at the foot of the
mound on the south part of the concession; Brazeau selling
only sixteen arpens in depth to Labeaume, who accepted the

sale with this reservation. In 1799,. Labeaume applied to the
governor to enlarge his tract acquired from Brazeau. "He asks
that you will be pleased to grant him 360 arpens of land, including the land which he the petitioner bought of Mi.Brazeau;
that is, twenty arpens in depth from the Mississippi in ascending
the Rocky Branch,lVest 1 S. by sixteen arpens in front along the
Mississippi, to be taken from the descending road into the
creek; which is the same front of the petitioner's land, the
angle (triangle) formed by the perpendicular from the road to
the river by the creek, and by the river shall complete, or about,
the tract asked for."
-In February, 1799, the governor granted the land to Labeaume,
with the boundaries asked for, and ordered that Soulard, the
surveyor, should put Labeaume into possession, and execute a
survey to serve the interested party, to obtain a complete title
from the governor-general, which was wished for by the petitioner.
On the 20th March, 1799,.Soulard proceeded to survey the
land granted to Labeaume, from which the larger quantity of
374 arpens was found to be within the boundaries described in
Labeaume's petition. The survey was regularly certified, April
10, 1799, and accompanied by a figurative plat.
The line marks of this survey have been retraced in the survey
recently made by the United States, and the patent to Labeaume or his legal representatives, of the .2.5th of March, 1852,
is founded on it. But it is insisted that the survey includes the
sixteen arpens reserved by Brazeau in his deed of May, 1798,
to Labeaume ; and on the existence of this fact the title of the
plaintiff in the present controversy depends, as the land
demanded lies -within the bounds of the patent. Labeaume
filed his title papers with the recorder of land titles, to be registered in February, 1806; and in his notice of claim, the
tract partly in dispute is thus described: " Louis Labeaume,
374 arpens of land, conceded in part to Joseph Brazeau, the-20th
June, 1794, and the other part -to Louis Labeaume, the 15th
February, 1779, settled and cultivated since both these dates."
On the 3d of September, 1806, the board of commissioners
appointed to adjudicate claims to lands under the act of 1805,
passed on Labeaume's claim. The clerk of the board gives a
description of it in these terms: "Louis Labeaume claiming
374 arpens of land situate on'the Mississippi, a distance of about
two miles- from the town of St. Louis, produces a concession
(duly registered) from Zenon Trudeau, for four by twenty arpens, dated the 20th June, 1798, (25th June, 1794,) granted td
one Joseph Brazeau, and .another concession from said Zenon
Trudeau to claimant, for the said 374 arpens, including the said

reserving to himself four arpens in superficieยง L spid certificate
dated the 12th May, 1798."
.
This entry is so confused as-t be unmeaning without reference to the title papers of record. .The board at- that time
rejected the claim because the concession had not been duly
registered.
On the 22d September, 1810, the:boardaconfirmed the claim
in the following terms: "-Louis Labeaume claims three hun'dred and seventy-four arpens of land. See book No. 1, page
517. The board confirm to Louis Labegume, tiee..hundred
and fifty-six arpens, and four.arpens to Joseph Brazeau, and order
that the same be surveyed agreeably to a concession from Zenon
Trudeau to Louis Labeaume, and, as respects the four arpens,
agreeably to a reserve made in a sale from Joseph Brazeau
to said Louis Labeaume, recorded in book C., page 339, in
the recorder's office."
On the 14th of June, 1811, the board ordered 'both tracts to
be surveyed at the expense of the United States, and to this
end gave the following certificates to the parties respectively:--

"Commnissioners' Certificate-No. 982, rne '14; 1811.
"We, the undersigned commissioners for adjusting the titles
to lands in the territory of Louisiana, have decided that Louis
Labeaume, original -claimant, is entitled to a patent under the

respecting claims to land in the territories of Orleans and Louisiana,' passed the third day of March, one thousand eight

hundred and thirty-nine of the recorder's office."
"By virtue of a concession, or order of survey, from Zenon
Trudeau, lieutenant-governor."
Signed by the commissioners.
Owing partly to a contest between the parties in this cause,
before the department of public lands, the surveys were not
executed and finally settled so that patents could be issued
thereon, till the 26th of February, 1852; and the patents for
both tracts were issued on-the 26th of March following: that
to Labeaume, or his legal representatives, embracing the land
in Soulard's survey; and the survey and patent made for
Joseph Brazeau, or his legal representatives, are located on
the southern boundary of Labeaume's tract. This suit had
been brought in the circuit court before the surveys were approved, or a patent issued to either party.
The representatives of Brazeau have refused to receive the
patent issued to them, and protest- against the binding force of
the survey; insisting that the confirmation by the commissioners conferred a perfect title for different land from that covered
by the patent. On -this state of facts, the circuit court instructed the jury as follows: "We have been engaged in this cause for the last fifteen
days, endeavoring to ascertain the fact whether the tract of
land confirmed to Louis Labeaume, according to Soulard's
survey of 1799, embraces the sixteen arpens confirmed to
Joseph Brazeau. Brazeau got :a concession for twenty arpens
in front on the Mississippi by four arpens back, and sold the
northern sixteen arpens front to Labeaume, reserving four by
four, or sixteen arpens, at the southern end of the tract granted
by the concession. In 1799, Labeaume got his tract enlarged
by an additional concession, including the sixteen arpens front
purchased from Brazeau. This latter concession was surveyed
by Soulard, the proper Spanish surveyor, in 1799, and the
survey was recorded." In 1810, the board of commissioners confirmed the grant to
Labeaume. according to Soulard's survey.
This being the
effect of the confirmation; at the same time that the board
confirmed Labeaume's claim, including the sixteen arpens front,
the claim of Brazeau was also confirmed, and a survey in each
ca.se was ordered by the board.
"Re ently, the survevs of these tracts were made according to

the precise instructions as -totheir boundaries, coming from the
general land-office at Washington, and pursuant to the order
of the secretaty of the interior; and on these surveys patents
have issued, one to the legal representatives of Labeaume, and
the other to the legal representatives of Brazeau; which tracts adjoin each other, on the southern boundary of Labeaume's tract,
as described in the'patent; and one question is, vhether the plaintiff to this suit can claim land elsewhere than that described in his
patent; in other words, whether he can abandon the land surveyed for him, and granted by patent, and go further north and
recover land there which never had been surveyed in conformity
to the concession. We are of opinion that the United States
reserved the power to locate,.by survey, the land confirmed to
Brazeau, and by such survey to separate it from the public
lands, and from the lands claimed by others, and to issue a
patent therefor, as was done in this instance; that this reserved
power was vested in the executive department, whose acts in
this instance bound Brazeau, and those claiming under him;
nor can they extend their claim and recover land beyond the
boundaries described in the patent to Brazeau .or his legal
representatives. The jury are further informed,* that all instructions heretofore given inconsistent with the foregoing are
withdrawn from their consideration; this instruction having been
given at the request of the jury, because they could not agree
according to the instructions heretofore given them by the court."
To the giving of which instruction to the jury, the plaintiff,
by his counsel, at the time duly excepted. A verdict was of
course returned for the defendant.
To comprehend the scope of the foregoing instruction to the
jury, we must consider the condition of claims to land derived
from France and Spain, before the United States acquired
Louisiana; with but few exceptions they were possessed and
cultivated in the upper province, at the date of the treaty, by
virtue of concessions from lieutenant-governors and commandants of posts,'in which no definite boundaries were prescribed
by the concessions themselves, but thc surveyor-general of the
province was instructed to measure the land, and mark out the
boundaries, and to put the interested party into possession. As
a general rule, a survey was required befoe possession was
given. Often, however, and probably in most instances, no
survey had in fact been made when the United States acquired
the country, in 1803; and of this unsurveyed class wat the concession to Joseph Brazeau. As these unlocated claims were
usually surrounded in part by public lands, and in other part by
the vague and unlocated claims of others, it became necessary
that definite boundaries should be established by legal surveys,

so that the limits of the public domain might be known, aond
private adjoining owners be exempt from disturbance and
litigation.
It has often been held by this court that the judicial tribunals, in the ordinary administration of justice, had no jurisdiction or power to deal with these incipient claims, either as to
fixing boundaries by survey, or for any other purpose; but that
claimants were compelled to rely upon congress, on which
power was conferred by the constitution to dispose of, and
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory
and property of the United States. Among these needful
regulations was that of providing that these unlocated claims
should be surveyed by lawful authority; a consideration that
has occupied a prominent place in. the legislation of congress
from an early day.
The act of March 3, 1807, ยง 4, was the first that gave a
board of commissioners power to adjudicate claims against the
United States, and conclude the government as to the question
of right in thi claimant. The judgments of the board on all
claims for less. than a league square were to a large. degree judicial, but as their powers and duties depended on the acts of
1805,1806, and w.ore especially on that of 1807, when they confirmed Brazeau's claim, we must ascertain from these laws
whether more was to be done to conclude the United States as
to any definite and distinct tract of land.
By the 6th section of the act of 1807, the commissioners
were bound to transmit to the secretary of the treasury, and to
the surveyor-general of the district where the land lay,.transcripts
of their final decisions, made in favor of each claimant, and
were required to deliver to him a certificate stating the circumstances of the case, and that he was entitled to a patent for the
tract therein designated; which certificate was to be filed with
the recorder, if the land lay in the district of Louisiana, and
with the register of the land-office, when the land lay in the
Orleans territory.
In all cases where tracts of land were granted by the board,
which had not been previously surveyed, the 7th s6ction of the
act of 1807 declared that they siould be surveyed under the
directions of the surveyor-general; and that he should transmit
general and particular plats of the tracts thus surveyed, to the
proper register or recorder. and also transmit copies to the secretary of the treasury. The certificate and plat being filed with
the register or recorder, he was thereupon required to issue a
patent certificate in favor of the claimant, which, being transmitted to the secretary of the treasury, entitled the party to a
patent in like manner as patents were issue& on lands sold by
the United States.

DECEMBER TERM, 1854.
West v.

415

CQchran.

By the act of April 29, 1816, a surveyor-general was appointed for the territories of Illinois and Missouri, with general
powers to survey the public lands into sections;" and also to
survey all lands confirmed by acts of congress, and to perform
the duties imposed on his -predecessor; the principal deputy for
Missouri territory, whose duty it was to survey the claims confirmed by commissioners, in all cases where they had not been
previously surveyed according to law.'
The commissioners having given Brazeau a certificate -that
he was entitled to a patent, according' to -his confirmation, pursuant thereto, several surveys were. made by deputy surveyors,
under instructions from the surveyor-general, but they were
rejected as improper and unlawful, either by him, or at.the
general land-office. Finally, in March, 1852, as above stated,
the claim was surveyed according to the instructiofs of the
secretary of the interior, and a patent issued.cn!forming to this
survey.......

The circuit court charged the jury, in-substance,, that in this
case of confirmation by the board sitting at St. Louis, in 1810,
the claim being relocated and vague, power was reserved to
the United States to locate the tract by survey.

It was competent for congress to take up these- titles or
rights, and act on them either by legislating directly that.-each
claimant should be -confirmed, and have a perfect title to his
actual possession lawfully acquired unde: France or Spain,
without ascertaining, in the act of confirmation, or .by. any
special means nrovided therein, the boundis ofclaimps confimed.
But it was also competent for congress to provide, that beforea
title should be given to any possessor, the exact -limits of his
possession, and the title which the United States was to give,
should be defined, ai- that this should be done by such agencies, and in such manner as might be fixed by congress. ,This.
is in entire -accordance with the provisions of the treaty, which
guarantees to the inhabitants the rights of property secured to
them; but it-was not intended to provide for the particular
modes and instrumentalities by which such rights should be
ascertained and enforced-these being left to the nation to
whose powers they were confided; so that the question is, what
has congress -deemed expedient? Now the policy which .is so
obvious, and which has been acted on by the United States
ever since they began to exercise power over the public lands,*
namely, to give defined limits to grants, may well be supposed
to have actuated congress in 1807. The provisions of that act
clearly show, that although congress intended that the commissioners should adjudge the existence of gdod titles to lands held

under French and Spanish possessors, yet they did not intend
that a final legal title, as against the United States, should be
made to vague grants, until their bounds had been ascertained
by the means there designated, and the particular tract defined
by survey.
Congress might have said, as was done in case of the St
Louis town lots and out-lots, by the act of 1812, that each man
should own what he had lawfully possessed under the former
government; and if congress had done so, then the question
would have been, in this instance, a matter of fact, to be tried
by a jiury, as to what the plaintiff did formerly possess, and
consequently own. But congress having said, by the act of
1807, that he shall be confirmed in what shall be designated by
a survey made, under the authority of the United States9
according to -the direction of the board of commissioners, and
such direction to survey being a condition which the judgment
of confirmation carried along with it, until the survey was
made, the plaintiff's title attached to no land, nor could a court
of justice ascertain its boundaries, as this power was reserved
to the executive department of the federal government; it follows that the legal representative of Brazeau, who brings suit,
had no title at the time it was brought that would support an
action of ejectment.
It is ordered that the judgment of the circuit court be affirmed.
Mr. Justice McLEAN. In this case I do not dissent, as it
is the understanding of the judges that the equity of the case
remains open for investigation.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the circuit court of the United States for the
district of Missouri, and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this
court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause
be and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs.
