PHOEBE .NNE.

RROR from the Circuit Cou rt for the Diftri& of Soutb
Carolina.

The Phebe Anne, a Britih veffel, had been captured by a
French privateer, and fent into'Charleioon. The Britijb Coful filed a Libel, claiming reftitution of the prize, upon a fuggeflion, that the privateer had been illegally out-fitted, or h,1
illegally augmented her force, within the United States. On
the proofs, it appeared, that the privateer had originally entered the port of Charleflon, armed and commilioned for war;_
that fie had there taken out her guns, mafts, and fails, which,
remained on fhore, till the general repairs of the veffel were
completed, when they were again put on board, with the fame
force, or thereabouts ; and that, on a fubfequent cruize, the
prize in queflion was taken. The decpees in the Diftri& and
Circuit Courts were both in favor of the captors 5 and on the
return of the record into this court, .Reed, having pointed
out the additional repairs, argued, generally, on the, impolicy
and inconveniency of fuffering privateers to equip in. our
ports.
ELSWORTH,

Chief 7uice. Suggeftions of policy and

conveniency cannot be confidered in the judicial determination of a queflion of right: the Treaty with France,whatever
that is, muft have its effed. By the I 9 th article, it jÂ§ declared, that French veffels, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, may, on any urgent neceffty, enter our
ports, and be fupplied with all things needful for repairs, In
the prefent cafe, the privateer only underwent a repair ; and
the mere re-placement of her force cannot be a material augmentation; even if an augmentation of force could be deemed
(which we do not decide) a fufflcient caufe for reftitution.
By THE COURT: 'Let the decree of the

Circuit Court be

affirmed.
