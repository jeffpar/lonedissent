will confent on the principles recognized in i Str, 419.
to remain refponfi-ble for -furrendering the Defendant, within
four days after the feflfins of Congrefs, provided that time is
alowed to make the furrender.
E. Tilgbman and RdJ1, the Plaintiffs counfel, having con4
fidered the propofition, for allowing further time to make the
furrender, agreed to it;. and THE COURT declared their approbation of the compromifei as affording a,good precedent for future cafes 9 f a fimilar kind,
Tilghnan then acknowledged, that he thought the privilege
of Congrefs extended to arrefts on judicial, as well as mefnej

' 2.. On the birth of a child, the hufband becomes only tenant

441. pl. 14- 3 inil. 19. And the hardfhip of the cafe cannot be overlooked ; for, as the attainder deprives the child of
all rights of property, derived through the guilty father, it
ought not, furely to work a difinheritance, likewife, as to the
eftate of an innocent mother.
For the Defendant, it was anfwered, that whether the fubjed was confidered on -general principles and authorities; or on
the pofitive provifions of the A& of Affembly ; a tenant by
the curtefy initiate poffeffes fuch an intere} in the wife's
cfate, as is forfeitable upon an attainder for treafon.
it.On general principles and authorities. It feems a.fArange
pofition, that the attainder of a traitor fhould, during his natura!
life, accelerate a defcent, to his child. But if the traitor had an
eftate in the premifes, itcannot defcend, it muff be forfeited during the continuance of fuch eftate; for all his cj/ates are forfeited. 4 BI. C. 374" 2 Wood. Le17. 504. The queftion is, therefore, fimply, whether a tenant by the curtefy initiate has any
/flate in the premifes, of which his wife is feized ? Before
iffue, his intereft is, indeed, merely in profpe&, a contingency,
an expedation, a poffibility: but after iffue " he begins te
have a permanent intereff in the lands;" and nothing but his
own natural death can defeat it. 2 BL Corn. 126. The contin gency has then happened, which, by the a& of the law,
makes him as much tenant for life, as if he were tenant for
life in reverfion, or remainder, per formam doni. The diftindt
ufe of the words, initiateand confummate, muff not be regarded as creating a contingency, but as defcriptive of a peculiar
effate. While the wife lives, even before the birth of iffue,
the hufband is feized of the land in fee in her right; and, after
the birth of iffue, during her life, he cannot have a better eftate;
though his title to an eltate, upon her death, is commenced, or
;nitrate. Hence his effate by the curtefy is called confunmrate
on the death of the wife, in relation to the new and independent
form by which he holds it ; the feizen being then feparate, that
was before joint. Co. Litt. 67. a. But, furely, when a man
acquires a right to exercife adts of ownerfhip, that the bare
1eizen in right of his -wife, would not authorife, he muft be
'confidered' as pffeffed'of fomc eftate. Thus, we find, that a
tenant by the cuttefy initiate acquires the right to do:homage
to the Lord alone. , Litt. f 9. Go. Litt., 3o. 67. 2 B. Corn.

forfeiture, the di&urm in Godb.2 3. is firongly in favor of the
Defendant,if properly explained, for, forfeiture on attainder
for treafon is always to the Crown ; 4 B?. C, 3,6. 381. and
that there-fhould be a forfeiture merely to difcharge the fatier's
lien upon the eftate, in favor of his children, is abfurd.
During the coverture, the whole eftate is forfeited ; and if the
hufband dies firfi, the eftate is as much difcharged by that event,
as it can be byhis attainder, But the analogy between the cafe
of curtefy, and the -cafe of dower, will aflif, in fupplying the
defe& of pofitive authority, Dower is forfeitable at common
law ; and yet dower depends on the fame contingency of furvivorfhip as curtefy, I H. P. C. 253. 359. 2 Bl.C. 130. i,
The feizen of the hufband gives an inchoate right to dower; as the birth of heritable iffue gives a curtefy initiate.:

urge'd, in anfwer, that the law does not caft an eftate upon him,

tion, by a condition, or by a purchafe, in the legal fenfe, diftin-,

In Co. Litt. 67. a. the curtefy is confidered as vefed(, liable
to be defeated by the death of the huflland, happening before
the death of the wi(e ; but when the hufband is regarded by
that authority as more than tenant for life, with a'power t4,

by the curtefy is a future eflate. Litt. f 35. and in fome refpe6ls the afertion is true : yet, it is equally crue, that in other

It is contended, however, that the forfkiture itfelf pre~vents
the guilty perfbn from being tenant by' thecurtefy; i Ba.

principle, that his title vells in the crown. In that'cafe, too,
if no office is foilnd, the eftate 'vould return to the 'hufliafid on'
a pardon; and even if ano'flice be'found, a pardon with words
of reftitution would. reffore it to him, provided no intereft
