JOHN STUART, JOSEPH STUART, JAMES STUART, AND WILLIAM
H. SCOTT, PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, V. HUGH M.AXWELL.

The twentieth section of the Tariff Act of 1842 provides, that on all articles manufactured from two or more materials, the duty shall bl,assessed at the highest rates
at which any of its component parts may be chargeable. (5 Stat. at L. 566.)
This section was not repealed by the general clause in the Tariff Act of 1846, by
which all acts, and parts of acts, repugnant to the r.rovisions of that act, (1846,)

were repealed.
Consequently, where goods were entered as being manufactures of linen and cotton,
it was proper to impose upon them a duty of twenty-live per cent. ad valores, such
being the duty imposed upon cotton articles, in Schedule D, by the Tariff Act of
1846. (9 Stat. at L.46.)

THIS case was brought up by writ of error, from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York.
The plaint.'. in error, who were plaintiffs below, sued the
collector to recover moneys for duties, paid under protest, alleged to have been overcharged at the port of New York, in
July, 1849. Verdict and judgment for defendant.
The plaintiffs made entry at the custom-house of goods as
being "manufactures of linen and cotton." The appraisers reported them to be manufactures of cotton and flax.
Upon such goods cbllector Maxwell charged duties at the
rate of 25 per cent. ad valorem,.according 1:othe 20th section of
the act of 30th August, 1842, which enacted, " ......
And
on all articles manufactured from two or more materials, the
duty shall be assessed at the highest rates at which any of its
component parts may be chargeable." 5 Stat. at Large, by
Little & Brown, p. 566, chap. 270.
The collector applied this 20th section to Schedule D, of the
act of 30th July, 1846; (9 Stat. at Large, by Little & Brown, p. 46,
chap. 74,) by which a duty of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem
was imposed on "cotton laces, cotton insertings, cotton trimming laces, cotton laces and braias ......
.; manufactures
composed wholly of cotton, not otherwise provided for;" being
so instructed by.the acting Secretry of the Treasury, by circular
of May 8th, 1848.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

151

Stuart et al. v. Maxwell.

The plaintiffs, in their protest, contended, "that under existing laws, said goods are liable to a duty of twenty per cent. as
a non-enumerated article," ......
"under the 30th section
of the tariff of 30th of July, 1846," dated 25th July, 1849, and
8th January, 1850.
The plaintiffs proved by witnesses, that the goods entered at
the customs in schedule A, were reported by the appraisers as
manufactures of cotton and flax; that he paid the duties thereon
at the rate of twenty-five per cent. ad valorern; that they
were manufactures composed of cotton and flax; "that the
proportion of flax in the goods varies considerably, being in
some about ahalf, in others about a third or a fourth; but that
the flax is the material of chief value in the goods; that the
appraisers' report of the goods as 'Imanufactures of flax and
cotton,' means that the fabrics were composed of linen and
eotton combined. None of them. were manufactures of cottn'
or flax alone."
The plaintiffs' counsel prayed the court to instruct, "that if
the jury shall find from the evidence that the goods in question
were manufactures of 'linen and cotton combined,' and not
'manufactures composed wholly of cotton,' then that duty was
exacted at the rate of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem, when
the goods were subject only to twenty per cent. ad valoren, as
a non-enumerated article, under the 3d section of the tariff of
1846." That instruction the court refused:
And charged the jury, that if they believe the goods in question are manafactures of flax and cotton combined, then, inasmuch as the 20th section of the tariff of 1842, directs that "on
all 'articles from two or more materials the duty shall be assessed
at the highest rate at which any of its component parts may be
chargeable, the goods in question are subject to the same charge
as articles enumerated under schedule D, as if manufactures
composed wholly of cotton not otherwise provided for, and that
they are therefore not articles subject to the duty of twenty per
cent. only under 3d section of the tariff of 184."
To the refusal to 'charge as moved by plaintiffs, and to the
charge as given to the jury, the plaintiffs excepted.
Upon this exception the case came up to this court.
It was argued by Mr. ohn S. 11c Cuilok, for the plaintiffs in
error, and by Mr. Cushin., (Attorney-General,) for the defendant.

11r. .11cCule/7 filed a voluminous brief, from which the reporter can only make an extract, and selects that point upon
which the decision of the court appeared chiefly to turn, namely
the 4th point in the brief; and upon this point he is obliged

to omit the arguments and illustrations under the heads B

and C
The points made by Mr. McCullok, were the following:
The Court erred in refusing to rule, as prayed by the plaintiffs, that the gbods being "manufactures of cotton and linen
combined," and not "manufactures composed wholly of cotton,"
were subject to only twenty per cent. ai valorein, as "nonenumerated articles," under section 3d of the tariff of 1846;
and also in charging the jury that "the goods were liable to
twenty-five per cent. duty under schedule D, as if they were
manufactures composed wholly of cotton, l)ecause the 20th section of the tariff of 1842 directed that in all articles manufactured from two or more materials, the duty shall be assessed
at the 'highest rate at which any of the component parts may
be chargeable," for the following reasons, 1:o wit:
1st. The tariff of 1846, by its first section, substitutes the
rates of duty thereby assessed upon the rnerchs ndise specifically
enumerated in its schedules from A to H, in lieu of the duties
theretofore imposed by all previous laws oa the articles therein
enumerated, and on such articles as were then exempt from duty.
2d. The tariff of 1846 specially enumerates, in its schedule I,
all articles that should be exempt from duty.
. 3d. All articles not specially enumerated in the schedules
from A to I of the Tariff of 1846, pay a duty of twenty per
cent. only, and'no raore.
4th. The provisions of the 20th section, tariff of 1842, which
require that "on all articles manufactured from two or more
materials, the duty shall be assessed at- the highest rates at
which any of its component parts may be chargeable," are
inconsistent with and repugnant to, - (a.) The object and policy
of the tariff of 1846; (b.) The provisions of section 1 and
schedules D and E of the tariff of 1846; (z.) The 3d section of
the tariff of 1846.
5th. But the 20th section of the Tariff of 1842 is not merely a
principle or rule of construction, and it -cannot, when applied
to the act of 1846, bring any article not specially named within
any of the schedules from A to I, of 1846: nor take any article
out of 'the provision of section 3, which imposes twenty per
cent. on all articles not enumerated in said act of 1846.
(a.) The object and policy of the act of 1946 do not permit the
20th sect. of the tariff of 1842 to operate on t4e 3d sect. of 1846.
The act of 1841, c. 24, (5 L. U. S. 463, 464,) is the first act
in which this clause occurs; and the act of 1841 had for its
object the carrying out of the policy of the Compromise Act of
1833 c. 5*5, (4 L. U; S. 629,) and by its first section provides,
that "on articles then (11th Sept. 1841) exempt from duty," or

DECEIMBER TERTN,

153

Stuart et al. v. Maxwell.

"then paying less than twenty per cent. ad valorern," there
should be levied and paid (after the 30th Sept. 1841) a duty
of t enty per cent. ad valorem," except on the articles thereby
exempted by name, &c. Then by its 2d section, 1841, c. 24,
directs, "That on every enumerated article, similar in material,
quality, texture, or use, to any enumerated article chargeable
with duty, there shall be levied the same rate of duty which
is levied on the enumerated article which it most resembles,
&e.; and if it resembles equally two or more enumerated
articles on which different rates of duty are now chargeable,
there shall be levied the same rate of duty as is chargeable. on
the articles which it resembles, paying the highest duty; and
on all articles manufactured from two or more materials, the
duty shall be assessed at the highest rates at which any of its
cOwponent parts may be chargeable;" this is followed by two
provisos, namely: 1st. That if a duty higher than twenty per
cert,. shall be levied under .the section, it shall not affect the
disposition of the proceeds of the public lands. 2d. That no
higher rate than twenty per cent. shall be charged on any unmanufactured article.
The act of 1841 does not profess to change the object of the
Compromise Act, but aims at the levying of an uniform rate of
twenty per cent. ad valorem, which was the uniform rate which
the biennial reductions under the Compromise Act intended to
effect. See 1833, c. 5, 4 L. U. S. 629.
The 20th section of tariff 1842, is identical in words with the
act of 1841, ยง 2, except that the "now" and the two provisos
are dropped.
The terms, "non-enumeratect articles," used in the act of
1841, then mean "articles" not specially named in the tariffs
of 1 32, July 14th, and 1833, c. 55.
The sazae terms, "non-enumerated articles," used in ยง 20,
tariff of 1842, have necessarily relation to ยง 10 of the act of 1842,
which declares-" That on all articles not herein enumerated
or provided for, there shall be levied, collected, and paid a duty
of twenty per cent. ad valorem." The act of 1842, c. 270, by
its sections from 1 to 9, inclusive, had substituted the duties
therein specified on the articles thereby enumerated in lieu of
the rates theretofore existing; and by its sections 10 and 20, prescribed twenty per cent. for articles not specially named or enumerated in said act, with the direction, that if higher duties could
be exacted by reason of the material, texture, quality, use or
fabric of articles not enumerated in said act, such higher rates
of duty should be taken.
The words of the 20th section are in the present tense. They
are (' the same rate of duty which is levied and charged," and the

terms ,therein of "may be chargeable," can only kelate to the
charging by said act, because: 1st, it repealed all other rates
theretofore laid, ยงยง 1 and 26; and 2d, all revenue acts in fixing rates of duty speak of the rates established in said acts,
or.in former acts; and 3d, to make provisions prospective rules
for finding rates, express words of future efficacy must be employed. See Mills v. St. Clair Co. et al. 8 How. 569; Amer.
Fur Co. v. U. S.2 Peters, 3.58.
And in ยง 20 of tariff of 1842, no prospective words to control
the rates that might thereafter be levied exist.
There never were any rules established by acts of Congress,
nor by judicial decisiohs, by -which it was laid down as a principl "that if any article were composed cf two or more materials itshould,'to favor commerce, be rated according to that.
component which was subject to the lowest rate of duty." The
whole of the tariff Acts of the United Stales proceed upon this
plan - 1st, enumerating the articles subjected to given rates of
duty; 2d, enumerating those exempted; and 3d, fixing an uniform rate or rates on articles not specially enumerated.
The courts have as uniformly held, that the only rules for
finding the rates of duty were to look for the article: "1st.
Among those named by species or -class. 2d. Among those
exempted. And 3d. If not there found, it was non-enumerated."
Such have been the decisionjs in Elliott v. S.wartwout, 10 Pet. 137;
Hardy v. Hoyt, 13 Pet. 292. The rules have been by the courts
recognized to be these: 1st. The commercial name or class is
to govern, bnd if the article belong equally well to two classes,
the- lowest tax shall be taken, (ex. flax-seed and linseed, schedules E and G, tariff, 1846.) 2d. That E. slight difference in
the make of the article shall not e: clude it from its class. See
Hall v. Hoyt, Ex. Doe. No. 49, 26th Cong. sect. 18, p.'33 ; Elliott
v.-Swartwout, 10 Pet. 137; 4 Cranch, 1; 6 Cranch, 284.
13d. That an article must have its entire fabric composed of
hemp or flax to fall within the description of a manufacture of
flax or hemp. See Hoyt v. Haight, Ex. Doc. No.49, 26th Cong.
sect. 1, p. 36.
4th. That an article composed of two materials,'such as hemp
-and flax, if manufacturers of hemp or flax be not specially enumerated as a class, is a non-enumerated arf'cle. See Hoyt v.
Haight, Ex. Doe. No. 49, 26th Cong. sect. 1, p.36.
5th. That if.
an article is not, at the .time of the passage of
the Tariff Act, known bythe name or class used in the tariff,
then it is- a non-enumerated article; and the use to which it may
be put makes no difference. See Curtis v. Martin, 3 How. 106,
- article, Cotton Bagging.
I A comparison of the rates of duty assessed by the tariff of

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.
Stuart et al. v. Maxwell.

1842, ,ith those assessed by the tariff of 1846, has been authentically made, and is contained in Ex. Senate Doe. No. 227, 29
Cong. I S. pp. 78 to 100. And by an attentive examination of
that document, it will be perceived that in the tariffs from 1789 to
1816 the rates were laid very uniformly; that from 1816 t6 1833
they gradually increased; that the tariff of 1842 is the most discriminative in favor of American manufactures, and laid higher
duties than any other tariff of the United States.
The act of 1846, then, from this comparison, merits the title
which it bears, namely, "An act reducing the duty on imports
and for other purposes." The object and design of the" act of
1846 was, then,
1st. to reduce the duties on imports.
2d. Thereby to increase the revenue, in view of he 1exican
war, &c.
3d. To specify all articles by name, and subject them to duty
thereby; to exempt some few from duty, and to provide an
uniform rate for all not enumerated.
The title of a revenue act guides in its interpretation. Strad
ling-v. Morgan, Plow. 203; King v. Cartwright, 4 T. R. 490;
The King v. G. Marks, et al. 3 East, 160; Rex v. Inhabitants
of Gwenop, 3 T. R. 133.
So the preamble is also a guide to the interpretation of such
an act. Salkeld v. Johnson, 1 Hare, 207; Emanuel v. Constable, 3 Russ. 436; Foster v. Banbury, 3 Sim. 40; U. S. v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610; State v. Stephenson, 2 Bail. 334; Burgett
v. Burgett, 1 Ham. 469.
Looking back over the statute-book at the act of 1841, it was
evidently framed upon the idea of the Compromise Act of 1833,
and its second section enacts the rules of similitude and highest
duty paying the component only with reference to articles
which were then not enumerated by the then existing tariff
acts.
And the act of 1842 was intended to levy the highest possible
rates on all manufactures, with the view of protecting domestic
manufactures, and hence it enacted by section 20 that similitude
and highest duty paying component, as by that act assessed,
should be graftedupon the 10th section,which assessedtwentyper
cent. ad valoren "on all articles not therein enumerated or provided for." This ig conclusively shown when the 10th and 20th
sections are read as one section, according to the rule that requires one clause to be read with other clauses, in order to determine the' sense of the words used. Crespigny v. Wittenoom,

SUPREME COURT.
Stuart et al. v. Maxwell.

rJr.Cushing, (Attorney-General,) conte:aded that there was
no error in the instructions of the Circuit Court.
Linen is itself a manufacture, a thing made by art, a cloth
made of flax or 'hemp, not a material for manufacture. The
entry made by the plaintiffs at the custom-house of their goods,
as "manufactures of linen and cotton," was an absurd description, a vulgarity which could not change the materials of which
the goods were manufactured, a stratagem which could not
elude the revenue laws, nor stop the ofcial appraisers from
reporting the truth, that the goods so entered, were manufactures of cotton and flax. So the appraisers reported, so the
plaintiff's own witnesses proved.
The 20th section of the act of 30th Augustf, 1842, is in force.
It is not repealed by the act of 30th July. 1846.
The 11th section of the act of 30th July, 1846, enacts, " That
all acts and parts of acts repugnant to the provisions of this act
be, and the same are, hereby repealed." There is nothin-g in
this act of 1846 repugnant to the provisions of the 20th section
of the act of 30th August, 1842. They can stand together with
consistency.
In Wood v. United States, 16 Peters, 362, 363, this court
stated the rule, that, "It is not sufficient to establish that subsequent laws cover some, or even all of the cases provided for by
it; for they may be merely affirmative, or cumulative, or auxiliary. But there must be a positive repLgnancy between the
provisions of the new law and those of. the old, and even then
the. old law is repealed by implication only, ,pro tanto, to the
extent of the repugnancy. And it may be added, that, in the
interpretation of all laws -for the collection of revenue, whose
provisions are often very complicated and numerous, to guard
against frauds by importers, it would be a strong ground to
assert that the main provisions of any &uch laws sedulously
introduced to meet the case of a palpable fraud, should be
deemed repealed, merely because in subsequent laws, other
powers and authorities are given to custom-house officers, and
other modes of proceeding are allowed to be had by them, bebefore the goods have passed from their custody, in order to
ascertain whether there has been any fraud attempted upon the
government. The more natural, if not the necessary inference
in all such cases is, that the legislature intend the new laws to
be auxiliary to and in aid of the purposes of the old law, even
-whensome of the cases provided for may be equally within the
reach of each. There certainly, under such circumstances,
ought to be a manifest total repugnancy in the provisions to
lead to the conclusion that the latter laws abrogated, and were
designed to abrogate, the former."

DECEMBER TERM,

tuart et al. r,. Maxwell.

The law does not favor repeals by implication; nor is it to
be allowed, unless the repugnancy be quite plain; and although
the acts be seemingly repugnant, yet they should, if possible,
have such construction that the latter may not be a repeal of
the former by implication. Bac. Abr. Stat. D; Foster's Case,
11 Coke, 63; Veston's Case, 1 Dyer, 347; Snell v. Bridgewater
Cotton Gin Man. Co. 24 Pick. 296, 298; Dwanrris on Statutes,
ed. 1848, p. 531, 533; Smith's Commentaries, ch. 19.
"A later statute on a given subject, not repealing an earlier
one in terms, is not to be taken as a repeal by implication,
unless it is plainly repugnant to the former, or unless it fully
embraces the whole subject-matter." Per Shaw, C. J., Goddard
v. Barton, 20 Pick. 407, 410.
"Acts la p6Lri Tateria are to be taken together as one law,
and are to be so construed, that every provision in them may,
if possible, stand. Courts, therefore, should be scrupulous how
they give sanction to supposed repeals by implication." Per
Wilde, J., Haynes v. Jenks, 2 Pick. 172, 176.
Therefore, it seems clear, that the 20th section of the act of
1842) is in force.
"The correct rule of interpretation is, that if divers statutes
relate to the same thing, they ought all to be taken into consideration in construing any one of them, and it is an established rule of law, that all acts in part materia are to be taken
together, as if they were one law." United States, v. Freeman,
3 Howard, 564; Ailesbury v. Pattison, 1 Doug. 30; Rex v. Lox
dale and others, 1 Burr. 447; Bac. Abr. Statute I, pi. 21, 22,
23, 24.
From these authorities, the 20th section of the act of 1842,
and the act of 1846, July 30th, relating to duties on imports,
"-are to be taken together, as if they were one law." By the
law, a duty of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem is imposed on
goods mentioned in schedule D, which comprises manufactures
of cotton; and a duty of twenty per cent. ad valorern is imposed
on goods mentioned in schedule E, which comprises manufactures of flax, and manufactures of hemp. But the goods entered
by the plaintiff at the custom house, which are the subjects of
this suit, were manufactures composed of cotton and flax, partly
of the one material and partly of the other. None of them
were composed wholly of flax, nor wholly of cotton,.but compounded of both, Therefore, by the said 20th section, the
duties upon such articles, manufactured from, the two materials
of cotton and flax were chargeable with the duty "assessed at
the highest rates at which any of its component parts may be
chargeable."
The 3d section of the act of 1846, (Vol. 9, p. 46, chap. 74,)
VOL. XVI.

SUPREMTE COURT.
Stuart et al. v. Maxwell.

which imposes " On all goods, wares aiad merchandise, imported from foreigf countries, and not specially provided for in
this act, a duty of twenty per centum ad valorem," must be
understood as comprehending only such articles, whether simple
or compound, manufactured or not maniifactured, as are not of
any of the materials charged.with duties by the act of 1846.
If that.3d section be not so limited, and the said 20th section
of the act of 1842 be not applied to all articles, manufactured
from two or more of the materials charged with duty in the
several schedules of the act of 1846, then the rates of duty above
twenty per cent. may, in a great variety of "atticles, be evaded
and reduced to twenty per cent. by manufacturers, entered
under new names, composed of two or more materials, one or
more of them chargeable with a duty of one hundred, or of
forty, or of thirty, or of twenty-five per cent. ad valorem, and
mixed -with a material or materials chargeable with the lower
rates of duty.
It is the necessary and proper understanding of this 3d section, that it be confined and limited as above mentioned, and
that the 20th section of the act of 1842 be applied to all articles
manufactured f. om two or more articles chargeable with duty.
If the decision-of the Circuit Court in this case is not sustained,
we may expect a swarm, of entries to b2 made at the custom
houses, of manufactures under new names, in evasion of the
duties above the rate of twenty per cent. ad valorern intended
by the act, of 1846. This suit to recove r back duties above
twenty per cent. ad valorem upon goods manufactured of cotton
and flax, entered at the custom house as "manufactures of
linen and cotton," and subject only to a duty of twenty per
cent., as nondescripts in the several schedr "s.A, B, C, D, E, F,
and G, is the beginning of a stratagem to -elude the revenue
laws, which, if successful, may be continued and accompanied
by others of the kind.
Mr. Justice CURTIS delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintifs in error brought their action in the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Southern District of New
York, against, the defendant, who was formerly collector of the
customs for the port of New Ybrk,-to recover moneys alleged
to have been illegally exacted as duties. The plaintiffs entered
at the custom house certain goods as "manufactures of linen
knd cotton," and claimed .to- have them admitted on Payment
of the duty of twenty per cent. levied on unenumerated articles
under the 3d section of the Tariff Act of 1.846. 'The defendant
insisted that the 20th section of the Tariff Act of 1842 was in
force, and that by force of it these goods, being manufactured

partly of cotton, must be assessed twenty-five per cent., that
being the duty imposed by the act of 1846 upon manufactures of cotton not otherwise pi'ovided for. If these articles
are, for the purpose of fixing the amount of duty, deemed by
law to be manufactures of cotton, it is not denied that the .duty
was rightly assessed. And whether they are to be so reckoned and treated, depends upon the question whether the 20th
section of the act of 1842 was repealed by the Tariff Act of
1846.
That 20th section is as follows: " That there shall be levied, collected and paid on each and every non-enumerated
article which bears a similitude either in material, quality, texture, or the use to which it may be applied, to any enumerated
article chargeable with duty, the same rate of duty which is
levied and charged on the enumerated article which it most resembles in any of the particulars before mentioned; and if any
non-enumerated article equally resembles two or more enumerated articles on which different rates of duty are ihargeable,
there shall be levied, collected, and paid on such non-enumerated
article the same rate of duty as is chargeable on the article it
resembles paying the highest rate of duty; and on all articles
manufactured from two or more materials, the duty shall be
assessed at the highest rates at which any of its component
parts may be chargeable."
This section is a reenactment of the 2d section of the Tariff
Act of 1841. 5 Stat. at Large, 464.
The repealing clause in the act of 1846, is, "that all acts
and parts of acts repugnant to the provisions of this act be, and
the same are hereby, repealed." It is alleged by the plaintiffs
that repugnance exists between the 20th section of the act of
1842 and the act of 1846. The argument is, that the act of
1846 divides all imports-.into three classes; first, those specified'
which are to be free of duty; second, those specified which are
required to pay different but specific rates of duty; third, those
not specially provided for in the act, which are required to pay
a duty of twenty per cent. ad valoren; that a manhfacture of
'cotton and flax not being included, nominatim, among the imports which are to be exempted from, or subject to, duty, is
necessarily embraced within the class of non-enumerated articles, and so are liable to a duty of twenty per cent. only; and
that this argument is strengthened by the fact that, in Schedule.
D, manufactures composed wholly of cotton are taxed tventyfive per cent.; and thit if it had been intended-to tax manufactares composed partly of cotton and partly of flax with a duty
of twenty-five per cent., they would have been specifically mentioned in this schedule; and 'that it is not admissible, under an

act which, in terms, levies a tax of only twenty per cent. upon
all imports not specially provided for, to kvy a tax of twentyfive per cent. upon an import not named or described in the act
as liable to that rate of duty.
The force of this argument is admitted. It is drawn from
sound principles of interpretation. But on a careful consideration of this case, we are of opinion that it ought not to prevail
in the construction of this law.
The act of 1846 is a revenue law of the United States, and
must be construed with reference to acts in. arimateria,of which
it forms only one part. This observance of a settled principle
for the construction of statutes is absolutely necessary in the
present state of the legislation of Congress on the subject of
revenue. Without it, the public revenue could not be collected,
and inextricable embarrassments and difficulties must constantly
occur. We are obliged to look at the whole existing system,
and consider the nature of the subject-matter of the enactment
under consideration, in its relations to tha system, in order to
pronounce with safety upon its repugnancy to, or consistency
with, any particular act of Congress.
In the first place, then, it must be observed, that the 20th
section of the act of 1842 does not impose any particular rate
of duty upon imports. It was designed to afford rules to guide
those employed in the collection of the revenue, in certain cases
likely to occur, not within the letter, but within the real intent
and meaning of the laws imposing duties and thus to prevent
evasions of those laws. Manufacturing ingenuity and sldll have
become very great; and diversities may be expected to be made
in fabrics adapted to the same rules, and designed to take the
same places as those specifically described by some distinctive,
marks, for the mere purpose of escaping from the duty imposed
thereon. And it would probably be impossible for Congress by
legislation to keep pace with the results of these efforts of interested ingenuity. To obviate, in part at least, the necessity
of attempting to do so, this section was enacted.
It does not seem to be any more repugnant to the provisions
of the act of 1846 than the great number and variety of provisions of the revenue laws, whose object was to cause the revenue to be regularly and uniformly .collected without evasion or
escape. If this act of 1846 had in terms enacted the 20th section of the act of 1842, its provisions would riot thereby have
been rendered repugnant or conflicting. This section would
then only have afforded a rule by which it could be determined
that certain articles did- substantially belong to and were to be
reckoned as coming under a particular schedule. This is apparent, not only from a consideration of -he subject-matter of the

20th section, when compared with the act'of 1846, but from
the fact that this 20th section actually made part of an act
whose subject-matter, and the outline of whose provisions, were
the sam6 as those of the act of 1846. The act of 1842 levied
duties on certain imports specifically named. It declared certain other articles, also specifically named, to be exempt from
duty, and it provided that a duty of twenty per cent. ad valorem
should be levied on all articles not therein provided for. Yet
this 20th section made a consistent part of that act. The
26th section of the act of 1842 provides, "that the laws existing on first day of June, 1842, shall extend to and be in
force for the collection of the duties imposed by this act on
goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the United States,
and for the recovery, collection, distribution, and remission of
all fines, penalties and forfeitures, and for the allowance of the
drawbacks by this act authorized, as fully and effectually as if
every regulation, restriction, penalty, forfeiture, provision, clause,
matter, and thing in the said laws contained had been inserted
in and re~nacted by this act."
The act of 1846 contains no corresponding provision. So
that unless we construe the act of 1846 substantially as an
amendment of the act of 1842, merely altering its provisions so
far as the latter enactment is inconsistent with the former, the
entire instrumentalities for the collection of the revenue under
the act of 1846 would be wanting, and the duties which it
requires to be paid could not be collected. It is quite apparent,
therefore, that a great number and variety of provisions designed
to protect the rcLenue against, mistakes, evasions, and frauds,
and to guard against doubts and questions, and to secure uniformity of rates in its collection, owe their present operation
upon the duties levied by the law -of 1846, to the vitality given
to them by the law of 1842, and must be considered now to bd
the law because the act of 1842 made them, in effect, a part of
its enactments, and because the act of 1846 does not interfere
with that enactment by which they were made so. And it must
be further observed, that these provisions of the 20th section of
the act of 1842 are of the same nature as those thus left in
force under the 26th section cf the act of 1842, having been
designed to remove doubts, to promote uniformity, and to check
evasions and frauds.
There is nothing, therefore, in the general scope of the act
of 1846 repugnant to the rules prescribed in this 20th section
of the act of 1842. Is there in its particular phraseology?
It is strongly urged that there is; that the terms of the 3d
sectin are wholly inconsistent with the attempt to bring any
article under either of the schedules, by operation of any law

outside of the act of 1846. That this 2d section enacts, in
clear terms, that a duty of twenty per cent. ad valoren shall be
levied on all goods "4not specially provided for in this act;" and
that to levy a higher rate of duty, by force of a provision of
some other act, is directly in conflict with the express words of
the law. It must be admitted there is great force in this
argument. It has received due consideration, and the result is,
that in our opinion it is not decisive. In the first place it may
be justly said, that if the act of 1846 has specially provided for
manufactures of cotton, and has at the same time left in force
a rule of law which enacts that all manufactures of which cotton is a component part shall be deemed to be manufactures
of cotton, if not otherwise provided for, it has, in effect, provided for the latter. By providing for the principal thing, it has
provided for all other things which the law declares to be the
same. It is only upon this ground that sheer and manifest
evasions can be reached. Suppose an article is designedly
made to serve the uses and take the place of, some article described, but some trifling and colorable change is made in the
fabric or some of its incidents. It "is new in the market. No
man can say he }as ever seen it before, or known it under any
commercial name. But it is substantially like a known article
which is provided for. The law of 1842 then declares that it is
to be deemed the same, and to be charged accordingly; that
the act of 1846 has provided for it under 1;he name of what it
resembles. Besides, if the words "provided for in this act"
were to have the restricted interpretation contended for, a like
interpretation must be given to the same words in other revenue
laws, and the most prejudicial consequences would follow; such
consequences as clearly show it was not the intention of Congress to have these words so interpreted.
Thus the 26th 'section of the act of 1842, already cited, adopts
existing laws for the collection of duties "imposed by this act,"
for the collection of penalties and remission. of forfeitures, and
the allowance of drawbacks" "by this act authorized." Yet, as
has already been said, it is by force of this adoption that the
duties and penalties under the act of 1846 are collected. It is
manifest that the structure of the revenue systen of the United
States is not iuch as to admit of this exact anct rigid interpretation; that the real intention of the leilature cannot thus
be reached. ' The true interpretation we consider to be this:
the 26th section of the act of 1842 having r&nacted the then
existing laws, and applied them :to the collection of duties
levied by that act, when Congress, by the act of 1846, merely
changed the rates of duty, without legislaiing concerning their
icoliection, the laws in force on that subject are to be applied;

and this application is not restrained by the fact, that, when
reenacted by the act of 1842, they were declared to be so for
the purpose of collecting the duties by that act imposed. The
new duties merely take the place of the old, and are to be acted
on by existing laws as the former duties were acted on; and
among these existing laws is that which affords a rule of denomination, so to speak; which determines under whatdesignation in certain cases a manufacture shall come, and how it shall
be ranked; when this has been determined, the act of 1846
levies the duty.
It is tirged, that in the act of 1846, special provision is made
for certain manufactures composed partly of cotton, and that
this shows no general rule was in operation imposing a particular rate of duty on articles made partly of cotton. But
that this would not be a safe inference is evident from the fact
that the act of 1842 imposes the same rate of duty on manufactures of wool and of manufactures of which wool is a component part, worsted, and worsted and silk, cotton, or of which
cotton shall be a component part; yet this act of 1842
contained the section now under consideration. It may be
observed, also, that schedule D, in the act of 1846, after manufactures composed wholly of cotton, goes on to specify cotton
laces, cotton insertings, trimming laces, and braids, &c.
It would not be safe for the court to draw any inference from
the apparent tautology of those parts of a revenue law describing the subjects of duty. In most cases, the terms used being
addressed to merchants, are to be understood in their mercantile sense, the ascertainment of which is matter of fact, depending on evidence; and that which may seem merely taL.
tologous might turn out to be truly descriptive of different
subjects.
On the whole, our opinion is, that there is nto necessary repugnance between the act of 1846 and the 20th seetion of
the act of 1842, and consequently the former did not rtpeal
the latter, and the duty in question was rightly assessed. The
judgment of the Circuit Court is therefore affirmed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
