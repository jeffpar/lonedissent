The

UNITED STATES v. DAVID BOWERS

and

HENRY MATHEWS.

CERTIFIcATE.-This eause came on to be heard

on the transcript of the record of the Circuit Court
of the United States, for the District of Georgia,
and on the questions on which the Judges of that
Court were divided in opinion, and was argued by
counsel. On consideration whereof, this Court is
of opinion, 1. That the act of the 30th of April,
1790, entitled, &c. section 8th, does extend to piracy committed by the crew of a foreign vessel on
a vessel exclusively owned by persons not citizens
of the United States, in the case of these prisoners,
in which it appears that the crew assumed the character of pirates, whereby they lost all claim to national character or protection.
2. That the 8th section of the act of the 30th of
April, 1790, entitled, &c. has not been repealed by the
8th section of the act of March 3, 1819, entitled, &c.
