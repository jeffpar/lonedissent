of
the Circuit Court of
of
the
record
the transcript
the United States for the District of Georgia, and

On consideration whereof, this Court is of opinion,
as to the first and second questions stated by said
Circuit Court, that it was not necessary the indictment should charge the prisoner as a citizen of the
United States, nor the crime as committed on board
an American'vessel, inasmuch as it charges it to have
been committed from on board an American vessel,
by a mariner sailing on board an American vessel.
And as to the third question, That the act of the
30th of April, 1790, is not virtually repealed by the act
of the 3d of March, 1819, entitled, " an act to protect the commerce of the United States, and punish
the crime of piracy."
