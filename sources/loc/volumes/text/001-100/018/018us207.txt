Previous to the year 1775, H. S. of Virginia, cohabited with A. W.,
and had by her the appellants, whom be recognized as his children.
In July, 1775, he niade his will, which was duly proved after his
.deceasb, in which he described them as the children of himself, and
of his wife A., and devised the whole of his property to them and
their mother. In June, 1776, he was appointed a colonel in the
Virginia line, upon the continental establishment, and died in the
service, havingin July, 1776, intermarried with the mother, and died
leaving her pregnant 'with a child, who was afterwards born, and.
naned R. S. After the death of H. S., and the birth of his posthumous son, a warrant for a tract of military lands was granted by the
State of Virginia to the posthumous son, B. S., who died in 1796, in
his minority, without wife or children, and without having located or
disposed ofthe warrant. His mother also died before 1796. Held,
that the children of f. S. were not entitled to the lands, as devisees
under his will, under the act of Assembly; nor did the will so far
_ operate, as to render them capable of taking under the act, as being
named his legal representatives in the will.
The appellants were not legitimated by the marriage of H. S. with
their mother, and his recognition of them as his children,.under the
19th sectioa of the act of descents of Virginia, of 1785, which took
effectoil the istof..Ianuary, 1787.
The appellants were not, as illegitimate children of H. S. and A. W.,
capable of inhdriting from R. S. under the act of descents of Virginia

from the Circuit Court of Ohio. This
was a suit in Chancery, and the case upon the facts

as his children.

In July, 1775, he made his will,

in which he described the appellants as the children

of himself, and of his wife Ann, and devised the

whole of his property to them, and to their mother.
In July, 1776, he intermarried with the said Ann
Whaley, and died the succeeding month, leaving her
pregnant with a child, which was afterwards born,
and was named Richard. The will was duly proved
after the death of the testator. In June, 1776, the
testator was appointed a colonel in the Virginia line,
upon continental establishment, and died in the service. After his death, and the birth of Richard, a
warrant for 6,666 and two-thirds acres of military
lands, was granted by the State of Virginid to the
said Richard, who died in the year 1796, in his minority, without wife or children, and without having
located or disposed of the above warrant. His mother also died before the year 1796. The defendant
claimed the land in controversy under John Stephenson, the elder paternal uncle of Richard; and the
appellants having filed their bill in the Court below
to recover the premises in question, the same was
dismissed, and the cause was brought by appeal to
this Court.

Mr. Brush, for the appellants, stated, that the appellants insisted, that, as representatives of their father, Hugh, the warrant in question ought to have issued to them. All the laws of Virginia, granting
military land bounties, were passed after the death of
Hugh Stephenson. The act which extends the
bounty to those who had died before any bounty was

tives, is used purposely not to exclude the heir, but to
embrace others than the legal heir, under the then
existing laws. It never could be intended to give a
bounty to elder brothers and uncles, who might be in
arms against the country; but to the immediate objects of the soldier's attention and care, whom, by
his will, he had appointed to represent him, or to
that class of relatives, among whom personal property was distributed by the statute of distributions;
certainly more just and liberal in its provisions, than
the feidal course of descents, by which real estate
was cast on the eldest male relative in a collateral
line. But, waving this point, thd complainants maaintain that they are heirs at law of Richard Stephenson. And thy maintain this upon -two grounds.
First. By the Virginia .law, regulating the course of
descents, passed in 1785, they were legitimated:
Second. By the same law, as bastards, they were
made capable of inheriting to their deceased brother,
on the part of the mother.
1. The ancestor of Richard never had any interest
-inthe subject that constitutes the estate. It is a gratuity given to his representative, who most clearly
took as a purchaser, and the estate he held, upon his
decease, passed to his heirs generally, without refererecto the channelthrcagh which he derived'it. The
estate originated under the laws of Virginia. The
parties resided in Virginia, until the establishment of

the State of Kentucky, where Richard died. Th
descent was cast, either under the laws of Virginia,
or Kentucky; and, in this respect, they are the same.
The act of 1785, provides, that "1 where a man
having by a woman one or more children, shall afterwards intermarry with such woman, such child or
children, if recognized by him, shall thereby be legitihnated." In the case of Rice v. IEfford,a and in
the case of Sleighs and Strider, cited by Judge Tucker, and given in a note,b it is decided, that this act
includes cases of births and marriages, antecedent to
its passage. This is its plain and natural interpretation. It was meant, as the Judges say, " to protect
and provide for "-the innocent offspring of indiscreet
parents, who had already made all the atonement in
their power for their misconduct, by-putting the children, whom the father recognized as his own, on the
samefooting as if born in lawful wedlock." It meant
to put them on the samefqoting, not only as it iespected their father's estate, butin relation to the estates of each other, and the estates of all their kindred. In both the cases above cited, the father died
after the act of 1786 took effect; and, in that point,
the present case is to be distinguished from them. It
would appear, from the case of Rice v. Efford, that
the Chancellor considered it a material point, that
the recognition of the illegitimate children took place
after the act of 178.5 was in operation. And Judge
Roane expressly says, that the interpretation adopted, "applies to cases only, where the father has died

posterior to the passage of the act." This observation of Judge Roane may properly be termed an Stevenson's
Heirs
obiter dictum. The case before him did not require
that point to be decided ; and, we conceive, that the Sullivant.
dictum is demonstrably incorrect, as is also the intimation of the Chancellor. The object of the act
was to " protect and provide for the children," by
giving them a complete capacity of inheritance. To
give them this title, the law requires two facts; the
marriage, and the recognition by the father. But, it
is said, that although the law embraces the case of an
anterior marriage,the recognition must be subsequent.
Why this distinction ? The grammatical construetion of the sentence does not require it. The terms,
" shall afterwards intermarry," are correctly referred
to the birth of the children, not the date of the act.
In relation to the marriage and the recognition, the
statute speaks froro the same time. The whole structure of the sentence necessarily connects them. The
active participle, ".having," in reference to the birth
of the children, and the passive participle, 4 recognized," in relation to their acknowledgment, are the
only terms which could properly be used to describe
both anterior and subsequent cases with reasonable
precision. Surely it would be a strange construetion, by which the active particijile is made to embrace both the past and future, while the passive participle, in the game sentence, is confined lo future
cases only! This can only be done by interpolating
the word hereafter, so as to make that part of the
sentence read, " such child or children, if HEREAFTER
recognized by him." The object of the statute does

CASES IN THE SUPREME COURT

212

not require, but absolutely forbids such interpolation.
It was designed, as the Court say, in the case of
Svon's
Stones v. Keeling6 to establish the most liberal and
Heirs
sull ant. extensive rules of succession to estates, "in favour
of all, in whose favour the intestate himself, had he
made a will, might have been supposed to be influenced." It operates solely upon the children, and it
must have been designed to operate equally upon all
in the same situation, whether the acknowledgment
was made before or after the passing of the act. The
dictum of Judge Roane, evidently grew out of an
argument suggested by himself, that the interpretation adopted by the Court, might be considered au
invasion of private right. We see no difficulty
on this ground; but if there were any, it is not
remedied by applying the act to cases only where
the father died posterior to its passage.
The possible interest which children have in the
father's property, during his lifetime, is not of that
absolute character which the legislature cannot control. If it were, every change of the law of descents, would be an invasion of the rights of expectants under the existing law. A descent cast
by the death of an intestate, cannot be disturbed by
subsequent laws; but that is no reason why the legislature should not change the law, or give to individuals new capacities of inheritance. The security of existing rights remains inviolable, notwithstanding this is often done. By the death of H. Stephenson, before the act of 1785, his property passed

to his legitimate child. If, under that act, the ap
pellants were legitimated, in 1787, they, thereby,
could not prejudice the rights of Richard. Their
new capacity was altogether prospective. From
that day, they enjoyed a character to inherit rights
which might thereafter accrue; and, in relation to
thosetights, we do not see what bearing the time of
their father's death has upon the question. In the
case of Sleighs v. Strider, W. Hall devised land to
his son, R. Hall, for life ; and after to..bis eldest son
and his heirs forever: but if no male issue, to his
eldest daughter and her heirs. Richard Hall had an
illegitimate son. born in 1776: in 1778 he married
the mother, and recognised the son till his death, in
1796. He had also daughters after the marriage.
It was determined that the son was legitimated, by
the act of 1785, and entitled under the devise from his
grandfather. It would seem, -from the dictum of
Judge Roane, that if Richard Hall had died before
the 1st of January, 1787, the grandson never could
have been legitimated. Whether he could or not,
the eldest daughter must have taken. But suppose
that the grandson had lived until 1788, and, in the
lifetime of his father, had died leaving issue: would
such issue, or the eldest daughter of Richard, have
taken under the devise ? We maintain that the issue
of the deceased son would have taken: from which
we infer that the time of death is immaterial. The
interpretation of the Virginia Courts can only be
made rational and intelligible by rejecting the limitations suggested by the Chancellor and Judge

Roane, and applying the statute to all persons within
z without reference to the tiine-of
its literal meaning,
the recognition, or the death of the father. By'thij
course, the new capacity, in all, will take date from
the 1st of January, 1787, and will confer rights from
that day only; as in cases that have arisen since the
statute, the legitimate rights of the children- born
before marriage, all take date from the marriage,
without any reference to the time of recognition, or
the death of the father.
2. We insist that the appellants, being the bastard
brothers and sisters of Richard on the part of the
mother, are his heirs at law. The law of 1785
contains this provision: "Bastards also shall be
capable of inheriting and transmitting inheritance,
on the part of the mother, in like manner as if lawfully begotten of such mother." In adopting a rule
for the interpretation of this provision, we insist, in
the language of the court, in the case of Stones v.
Keeling," that "the act relates to the disposition of
property only; and proceeds to show who shall be
admitted to share the property of a person dying intestate, notwithstanding any former legal bar to a
succession thereto; and in that light the law ought
to receive the most liberal construction ; it being
evidently the design of the legislature, to establish
the most liberal and extensive rules of succession to
estates, in favour of all, in whose favour the intestate
himself, had he made a will, might have been supposed to be influenced." It gives to bastards a fill

OiJQ.Pf this, can the terms of the law be satisfied.
It is said, however, that the terms of the law are sohivant.
fully satisfied when it is extended to inheritance direct, between the bastard and the mother; thus excluding collateral descents between bastards altogether. This doctrine is founded upon an entirely erroneous rule of construction.. It is assumed that the
statute. being an innovation upon the common law,
must be construed strictly, and extended only so far
as the letter absolutely requires. The Virginia
Courts, in the cases referred to, have adopted a different rule; and a rule more consonant to reason and
justice, and to ouir free and equal principles of government. The incapacities of bastards grew out
of the feudal system, and originated in the dispositions of the feudal lords to multiply escheat s and
forfeitures. Most undoubtedly it was the intention
of the Virginia legislature, to cut up the whole system root and branch. If bastards cannot inherit from
a legitimate brother, they cannot inherit from each
other. Neither can they inherit from, or transmit
inheritance to, uncles, grandfathers, or any collateral relative whatever. By the same rule, legitimate
brqthers and sisters cannot inherit from bastards, or
their descendants. And if this be the case, who
can say that bastards are capable of inheriting "1and
transmitting inheritance, on the part of the mother,
in like manner as if they had been lawfully begotten
of such mother.."

ed to be admitted on the other side, that Richard
Stephenson took by purchase from the State, and
that Hugh never had an interest in the subject, legal
or equitable, which he could devise, or which could
pass from him in a course of descents If this be so,
it would certainly follow, that upon the death of
Richard, under age and without issue, after having
survived his mother, the estate passed from him to
his heirs general, according to the letter of the act
directing the course of descents, as the appellants'
counsel contend, and without reference to the channel through which he obtained it. But we shall insist, that according to the equity of the 5th section
of the act of descents, the land passed to the fraternal kindred.
One of the laws of Virginia on the subject of land
bounties refers to them, as having been "promised
by ordinance of Convention." This circumstance
made a search for that ordinance necessary. There
were three sessions of a Convention held in the year
1775. By an act of the last, the Convention of 1776
was regularly elected. The present controversy has
had the effect of collecting the journals of both Conventions. They are now, for the first time, published. A perusal of them will show, that the Conventions,
although they provided for raising troops, never made
a promise of land bounty to any description of the public forces. Indeed, until they declared the State inde182.

inthe acts of the first regular General

enacted after the death of Hugh Stevenson. The
practice of giving bounties in land was followed up
by the acts of October, 1778, c. 45, May, 1779,
C. 6., and the manner of carrying them into grant
was provided for by the acts of May, 1779, c. 18.
and of October 1779, c. 21. But these laws having omitted to provide for the heirs of those who
were, or should be, lost in the service, two others
were passed. By the first a promise was made to
the officers and soldiers, then living, in these words :
"and when any officer, soldier, or sailor, shall have
fallen, or died in the service, his heirs or legal representatives shall be entitled to, and receive, the same
quantity of land as would have bpen due to such
officer, soldier or sailor, respectively, had he been

(comprehending the case of H Stevenson:) "lThat

the service, before the bounty in lands promised by
this or anyformer act, shall be entitled to demaud
and receive the same in like manner as the officer
himself might have done if living. It is observable,
that the latter act only respects the heir of an officer
who had fallen before any lpnd bounty was promised

to any person ; whereas the former is an encouragement held out to the living officer, soldier, and sailor,
&c. By the latter act, itis evident that the bounty conHeirs
SYiant, ferred by it was not given to those who died before
any bounty was provided; nor to the legal representatives of those, on account of whose services the
same was given, as such. The bounty is directly
-given to the legal representative for the loss of an ancestor ; and is so much as the father would have been
entitled to had he lived or fallen in the ,service) &c.
Here, if the heir took quasi heir, the debts of his
ancestor might sweep the gift away. The difference between pay and bounty cannot well be overlo6ked. The first is a vested estate, and, as such,
subject to debts and legacies. Bounties to the widow or heir, are in the nature of compensation, or
of gratuities for a loss, and are taken directly from
the hand that gives. Hugh Stevenson had not,
at the time of his death, even a promise of the
bounty in question, nor of any other bounty. His
services entitled him to his pay and subsistence
alone.
It is difficult to comprehend what is meant by the
opposite counsel, when he speaks of those " whom
by his will he had appointed to represent him, or to
that class of relations among whom personal property was distributed by the statute of distributions."
As to the statute of distributi6ns, it is enough to say,
that then, as well as now, it no more embraced a
bastard than the feudal law of descents. And as to
the terms " appointed by his will to represent him,"
if they mean any thing, they mean the persons to

question ? Real estate in Virginia was never devisable at the common law. In 1776, the English sullivant.
statute of wills was in force. Under that statute,
those only who were seised, could devise. The construction of that statute was the same in England
and Virginia. Those lands only, which the testator had at the time of making his will, could be devised. The Virginia statute of wills empowers a
party to devise such estates, real or personal, as the
party hath, "1or at the time of his death shall have,"
&c. This statute passed in 1785, and began its operation on the 1st of January, 1787. It is, then, obvious that the appellants cannot claim as devisees,
neither at the common law, nor under the English
statute of wills ; nor even under the Virginia statute
of wills, if it had been then in force; because neither at the time of making his will, nor at the time
of his death, had the testator any interest in the premises.
2. The appellaiits claim as heirs at law to Richard, under the 19th and 18th sections of the act directing the cause of descents. The 19th section is
in these words: "Where a man having, by a woman, one or more children, shall afterwards intermarry with such woman, such child or children, if
recognized by him, shall be thereby legitimated." The
issue also in marriages deemed null in law, shall,
nevertheless, be legitimate. And the 18th section is
in these words: "In making title by descent, it
shall be no bar to a party that any ancestor through

mother, in like manner as if lawfully begotten of

an alien. Bastards also shall be capable of inherit-

such mother."
In the construction of statutes no authority need
be quoted for the following rules of interpretation.
1 st. All the acts passed at any one session of a legislative body are to be taken together as one act.
2d. Consequently, the same words or phrases, as
often as they occur, are to be construed to have the
same meaning when that can be given them without
gross violation of the sense. 3d. The acts of the
same session, made in pari materia, are to be taken
together as one act. The marriago act, the act of
descents, the statute of wills and distributions, and
the act respecting dower, were made in pari materia.
Marriage is the source of all legitimate birth, and,
as such, the cause of dower, of descents, and of
distributions. These laws have extraordinary claims
io be considered as one statute. They were compiled at the same time, by the same committee,
composed of the ablest lawyers and civilians of their
country-enacted at the same session of the sa~ie
legislative body, in the same year, (1785 ;) and,
lastly, all went into operation at the same time, on
the Ist of January, 1789. They will be fouAd to
contain a complete code for the government of domestic relations, without any contradictions or discrepancies. These four statutes contain 164 sections; in almost every one of which the future verb
shall occurs, and in all of which, with the exception

OF THE UNITED STATES.

of the 7th section of the marriage act, (which confirms past irregular marriages,) its future operation
cannot be disputed, nor never has been disputed.
With the rules of construction'already stated, and
this view of the four tatutes, we will proceed to
show, that the appellaints' construction of tile 19th
section is incorrect. And this, 1st, on principle,
and, Mly, on authority. First. The rules of construction entitle us to give to the verb shall, in this
section, the same meaning intended whenever it occurs in any of the statutes. If the legislature had
intended to confer legitimacy on those recognized before the 1st of July, 1787, they certainly would have
left us nothing for construction. They would not
have been less cautious than in the preceding section
they had shown themselves on a less important subjec; "is or hath been an alien," &e. Again ; it is
the obvious policy of a just legislature, that this act
should operate prospectively, not retrospectively.
Words which might bear both constructions, ought
to be expounded according to that policy; to give a
statute a retroactive effect without evident necessity,
is inconsistent with this policy. To give to this act
an operation upon past births and marriages, is to
carry the liberality of construction far indeed. But
to cause it to operate on the past recognitions of the
father who is dead, before the commencement of the
statute Itself, would be unjustifiable. The principle
of the law is, that after marriage, the father, if he
pleases, may render his children legitimate. Legitimation, in this view, is the effect of the father's
agreement; an effect of which he must be sensible

22i

Ses'

22

to make it his act. It is easy to conceive of cases
stevenon's in which a father, willing to soothe his wife, and
Heirs
make the best of his case, might be brought to say
V.
Sutivant. that her children, born before their marriage, were
his, at a time when such acknowledgment would
have no legal effect whatever; but who, with the
provisions of this statute before him, would make
such an acknowledgment; an acknowledgment which
would make the child his heir, and pledge him to
the mother and the world to provide for it as such.
To construe the act as having a retrospective effect
on past recognitions, would, therefore, be against
the general policy of legislation; contrary, often, to
the wish of a deceased individual; and might be productive of much injury to private rights.
But, it is said, that the possible interest which
children have in the property of their father in his
life time, is not of that absolute character which the
legislature cannot control. This is admitted, and the
statute of descents is an exercise of such a control. But
the new rule of descents created by that act, is known
to the prop: ietor in his life time, and if that pleases him
not, the statute of wills, of the same date, is placed in
his hands, and enables him to control the act of descents. Again ; it is a maxim that nemo est heres
viventis. In life, the relation of father and child
exists between legitimates, but not between illegitimates. The relation of ancestor and heir, presumptive or expectant, may exist while the former is still
living. But the legal relation of ancestor and heir
never does exist until the death of the father. The
moment the eyes of the father are closed in death, is

appellants.
To examine the 19th section upon authority. The
cases of Rice et al. v. Efford et'al.a and of Stones
v. Keeling, and Hughes v. Strikerb are all that bear
upon the subject. The only question which seemed
to create much difficulty in those cases was, whether
births and marriages, before the act, were-embraced
by it? and the decisions are, that such births and
marriages are embraced, where the children, -torn
before wedlock, had been recognized by the father,
after the 1st of January, 1787. But this is said to
be nothing more than an obiter dictum of Judge
Roane. But we regard it as the reasoning of the
Court, given by the only Judge who gave any reason
forthedecision. A decision, that marriages and births,
before the act, are embrace'd by its provisions, be"
cause the recognition took place after the act was in
force, is plainly a decision, that, but for the subsequent recognition, prior marriages and births could
not be considered as within the act. These cases
furnish good authority for applying the 7th section
of the marriage act, to marriages contracted before,
but existing on the 1st of January, 1787; and for
substituting the words " hath been," in the act of
descents respecting aliens, for the words 11 shallhave
been." If this be correct, both those provisions will
accord with the residue of the acts containing them,

and with the act concerning dower; and the statute

wills and distributions. The* operation of all,
will then be prospective.
The statute of descents shows, that wherever, ia
adopting the civil law, its fiamers meant to exceed or
fall short of its provisions, they have done so in explicit terms. By the civil law, the marriage of the
parents legitimated the children previously born,
without the father's recognition.a This legitimation
was the subject of the famous proceeding at the parliament of Merton. The ecclesiastics there demanded, that the marriage of the parent should legitimate
the ,children; to which the barons returned their
memorable answer: "Nolumus leges Angliwe mutari. The common lawyers of England, therefore,
would not agree to adopt the civil law in this particular. But the common lawyers of Virginia, who
compiled the act of 1785, determined to adopt the civil
law in this particular, sub modo ; that the marriage
of the parents should legitimate the children, provided the father should afterwards recognize them. It
is contended, on the other side, that this recognition
is nothing more than statutory eviden'ce of the fact,
which might be otherwise proved, and is not of itself
a substantive provision. If this argument be correct,
-then by the common and civil law a bastard must
-always have been the heir of his natural father, provided the identity of that natural father could be
proved. But as we know that the mother, both by

witness to establish the fact of the father's identity, and
yet never resorted to for the purpose of making her
child heir to the father, we have a right to conclude,
that the recognition required by the statute, is something more than mere evidence of the fact;
3. The appellants claim as heirs of Richard Stevenson, under the 18th section, and in support of
this claim they contend, that the terms, "inheriting
or transmitting inheritance on the part of the mother,
in like manner as if they had been lawfully begotten
of such mother," confer a capacity to inherit and
transmit inheritance in the ascending as well as descending line, and also from and among collaterals.
Their doctrine amounts plainly to this : that by the
true construction of the second member of the 18th
section, bastards are made the legitimate children of
their mothers, at least Qpr the purposes of inheritance.
In expounding the statute of descents, it has been
justly remarked by Judge Tucker, that the framers
of it were eminent sages of the law, and complete
masters of its technical terms. This being the case,
it would be reasonableto look for the same technical
language, in all cases where the same thing was intended. When in the 19th section of the act of descents, and also in the marriage act, they remove from
certain classes of bastards all the disabilities under
which they laboured, they employ that legal term
which conveys their meaning clearly, and leaves nothing for construction. They say they shall be "legitimate," not that they shall be capable of inheriting
it on the part of their mothers %nd fathers ;" leaving

The consequences of

their legitimacy fbllows. They have father and niother, sisters and brothers, uncles and aunts, with an
universal capacity of inheriting and transmitting
inheritance. The 18th section immediately preceding, if it had been intended to make bastard children
the legitimate offspring of their mothers, would have

followedthe same language, and would have left nothing to interpretation. That section would have
read thus: " In making title by descent, it shall be
no bar to a party, that any ancestor through whom
he derives his descent from the intestate, is, or hath
been an alien or a bastard. Bastards also shall be
considered in law as the legitimate children of their
mother." The 19th section,' like the marriage act,
gives no new capacities to bastards as such.

They

make certain persons of that description legitimate,
and the capacities of legitimacy follow of course.
They inherit to both parents, aot as bastards, but as
their legitimate offspring.
The second proposition of this argument is, that
all the disabilities of bastardy are of feudal origin.
With us it is of Saxon origin. The term bastard
being derived from a Saxon word, importing a bad,
or base, original. The disabilities of bastardy are
the same under the civil as under the common law,
and in all ages and nations.a He has no ancestor;

law. But by the civil law he can inherit his mother's estate.a She is, therefore, the propositus of
the civil law. Collaterals descended from a male
relative are by the civil law termed agnati; those'descdnded from a female relative cognatib In a note
to Cooper's Justinian, which I take to be from the
pen of Sir Henry Spelman, it is said that illegitimate children can have no agnati-Quia neque
gentem neque familian habent. If for this reason they can have no agnati, it follows that they
can-have no cognati; and this is the reason of Jusfinian's broad proposition, that.bastards can have no
collaterals ; which is our doctrine in this case.
It is admitted that the 18th section does not give
legitimacy except specially for inheritance ; that is,
it removes that incapacity, and no other : finding and
leaving them bastards. Now, there are no other disabilities except the incapacity to inherit or to hold a
church dignity-d And since these dignities do not exist
in the United States, if it had been the intention of the
legislature to place the bastard on the footing of a
lawful child of his mother, for the purposes of inheritance, and thus to admit him among collaterals in
her line, it is inconceivable why they should not have

said at once, that bastards shall be considered in law
the legitimate children of their mother. Instead of
which, they have used a technical term, exparte materna ; which in the civil law is constantly opposed
to this other term, ex linea materna. Ihe first importing a capacity of lineal inheritance; the other,
that, and collateral inheritance also. Neither by the
common nor civil law could she inherit to her child,
even chattels ; she is not mother for inheritable purposes by either code; and the 18th section has given
ber no inheritable blood of her child. Being incapable of inheriting herself, she cannot give inheritance
to a legitimate child by the civil law; because, by
one of its canons, the child can never succeed by representation or succession, where the paren.t could
not.
. So far, therefore, is the assertion, that the heritable
disabilities of bastardy are of feudal origin, from being correct, that they were known and enforced
from time immemorial in all nations; were known
and enforced in England, before the Norman sat foot
there. The Ecclesiastics at Merton did not demand of the king that bastards should inherit even
to their mother. They simply demanded, that by
the intermarriage of their parents they should become legitimate; which was refused.
But it is contended by the appellants' counsel, that
the words,

'.

in like manner as if lawfully begotten

of such mother," apply as well to collateral as lineal
inheritance. But what is that which a bastard has
capacity to do, " in like manner as if lawfully begotten of his mother ?" The answer is in the words of

the statute, "of inheriting and transmitting inheritance on the part ofhis inother."
But, we insist, that although Richard Stevenson,

Heirs

the son, took by purchase from the State; yet he

SuUivant,

took quasi heir, to hold as such to the use of his
male ancestry,- under the equity of the 5th section of
the act of descents : "1Provided, nevertheless, that

where an infant shall die without issue, having title
to any real estate of inheritance derived by purchase
or descent from the father ; neither the mother of

such infant, or any issue which she may have by any
person other than the father of such infant, shall
succeed to, or enjoy the same, or any part thereof,
if there be living any brother or sister of such infant
on the part of the father, or any brother or sister of
the father, or any lineal descendant - of either of
them." The principle of this section is, that the
estate which came from a male ancestor, shall return
to his stock. The principle of the 6th section, immediately following it, is the same; that the estate
which came from a female ancestor, shall return to
her stock. It is admitted, that the case of Richard
Stevenson is not within the letter of the 5th section; but is it not within the equity of it ? The
estate came not from the father by descent, or by
gift; but in equity we may pursue the consideration
of the grant, and have a right to inquire, whether
that consideration was furnished in common, by the
paternal and maternal kindred; and, therefore, ought
to pass to both lines. The consideration of the grant
to Richard Stevenson, is his father's military serVice, and his death in that service. Loss is a valuq-

ble consideration for a grant, and the grant ought, in
consequence, to be made to the heir of the family

suffering the loss. A military bounty is in the nature of compensation for a loss, or of a gratuity for
services. It is intended to supply to a family, as tlr
as the liberality of the country can supply the place
of a lost member. They are intended to avail the
heir in his pecuniary concerns to the extent to which
it is supposable his father's labour might have availed him had he lived. In this view, therefore, the
bounty, given by law to the heir, is, in equity, a paternal estate, and should descend and pass to tile
paternal kindred, in exclusion of the maternal.
The Attorney- General, on the same side, contended, that the appellants were not entitled, either as
legal representatives of Hugh, or as heirs of Richard
Stevenson.
1. The appellants were not the legal representatives of Hugh Stevenson; for legal representatives
are those whom the law appoints to stand in a man's
place, and such was not the case of the appellants.
The law recognized no connexion between them
and Hugh Stevenson.
But, it is objected, that the father had made them
his legal representatives by his will. This admits of
various answers: but one is sufficient, that the will
was a nullity; it was revoked by the subsequent

Stevenson; for, being natural children, there was

no common blood between them.
It is again objected, that they were legitimated by
the 19th section of the law of descents. But this
clause has received a judicial exposition by the highest Court of the State, in which the law was passed,
and is now the settled law of that land. In the cases
of Rich v. Efford,a and Sleighs v. Strider,' the Court
of Appeals of Virginia decided, that the act applied to
cases of prior births and marriages; but, that to
give it an application, the father must have been in
life after the passage of the act. In this case, the
father had died more than ten years before the act
took effect, and, consequently, the case at bar is not
within its operation. But, it is said, that the Court
of Appeals were right in extending the law to cases
of births and marriages antecedent to the act; but
they were demonstrably wrong in declaring, that the
act applied to cases only in which the father had
died posterior to the act. To which we-answer, that
the precedent cannot be divided ; if it is to have the
authority of a precedent, it'must be taken altogether;
it cannot be entitled to the authority of a precedent
so far as it favours the opposite side, and be open to
dispute so far as it destroys their position. It has
been the settled law of Virginia, since the year

lows the disturbance of a rule of property which
has been so long settled; and that this argument ab
inconvenienti, was of great weight in the estimation
of the Court of Appeals itself, may be seen from the
proposition to reconsider the decision of that Court
in the celelrated case of Tomlinson and Delland.
The original decision in that case, which subjected
the succession to personal property, to the feudal
principle, which, in relation to lands, respected the
blood of the first purchaser, had been made in 1801.
It having produced great excitement in the State,
and being very generally disapproved, a reconsideration was most strenuously pressed in 1810, nine
years only after the original decree; but a majority of
the Court was of the opinion, that the inconvenience
of overthrowing what was already considered as a
settled rule of property, was too great to be encountered, even if the decision were erroneous at first. It is
true, that they thought the decision called for by the
stern language of the law; but from one of the Judges
this opinion was wrung with such manifest reluctance,
that it was believed he would have come to a different result had the question been res integra. Here
the rule having been settled, the Court will say how
far it ought now to be considered as the settled law
of the State.
If, however, these precedents be open to question
at all, they are open throughout; and if the Court of

Appeals erred at all, it was not in limiting the operation of the law to cases in which the father has died
since the act took effect, but in extending it to cases
of births and marriages which happened anterior to
the passage of the law. This law took effect on
the 1st of January, 1787. The births, the marriage,
the recognition, and the death of the father, had all
occurred in, and prior to August, 1776. Had the
legislature of Virginia the right to pass a retrospective law? The Court of Appeals said not, in the
cases of Turner v. Turner's executgrs,0 Elliott v. Ly:
ell,band the Commonwealth v. Hewitt." Even where
it has been attempted to apply a new remedy to preexisting rights, it is said the language must be irresistibly clear, or the Court will not give it such retrospective operation.
Does the language of this act clearly intend to
operate on pre-existing facts? on pre-existing marriages and births ? We contend that it does not. In
the case of the Commonwealth v. Hewitt, before
cited, Judge Roane, in resisting the retroactive effect
of the law, founds himself, in a great measure, on
the general nature of laws, as prospective, and on the
time assumed by the act itself for the commencement
of its operation, from and after the passing thereof.
Both considerations concur here, with this farther
,circumstance in favour of this law, that while it has
(in the original act) the usual clause, " This' act
shall commence in force from and after the passing
thereof," a subsequent and distirt law was passed

Si11jvant. first clause is, " be it enacted by the general assembly, that henceforth, when any person having title,
&c." According to settled rules of construction,
therefore, the force of this expression, henceforth,
runs through every subsequent clause. The 19th
section under consideration ought to be read thus:
"Be it enacted that, HENCEFORTH, [that is, after
the Ist of January, 1787,] where a man, having by
a woman, ne or more children, shall, afterwards,
intermarry with such woman, such child or children, if recognized by him, shall thereby be legitimated." Is this language so irresistibly retrospective,
in relation to the date of the law, that the Court is
constrained to give it that construction ? Is it not,
on the contrary, so obviously future and prospective,
that it requires subtility and violence to wrest it to a
retrospective meaning? The verbs which indicate
the acts that are to produce the effect of legitimation;
are in the future tense. It is insisted, therefore, that
the clause has no application to any case, but to one
in which all the fatts on which it is to operate, shall
happen after its passage; the birth of the children,-.
the marriage, and the recognition. It Is true, that in
speakiag of the children, the present participle is
used, "having one or more children."* But the present tense of this participle relates, not to the time
of passing the act,'hut to the time of the marriage,
" having,": at the time of the marriage, ", one or more
children." This is not a new use of the present tense;

in relation to the action with which it stands connected, though future, in relation to the time of speaking.
So the present participle here is present in refer.

the legislature had said, " wherever, hereafter, a

and shall, afterwards,intermarry with her," &c. It
is only by this construction which considers both the
birth and marriage as fut tre, that the word " afterwards," used in the act, acquires a grammatical sense,

and the adverb of time, afterwards, added to the verb,
does not perform its appropriate function of adding
a new quality to the verb. It is a useless clog, therefore, on the sense, because its tendency is to obscure,
and not to illustrate the sense. Whereas, the construction for which we contend, (by considering both facts
as posterior to the act, but the marriage as being posterior to the birth,) gives the word, afterwards, force
and-significancy; it then performs the office of arranging the order of the two future events. In this point
we differ from the Court of Appeals of Virginia, and
insist, that the liberality which would apply this act
retrospectively, to previous births and marriages, is a
liberality which looks beyond the judicial sphere, and
belongs only to the legislature. What is the argument on which the Court of Appeals (and the opposite counsel, after them) ground themselves in extending this act to antecedent births and marriages? "I see no difficulty," says Judge Roane,
in Rice v. Efford,a "except what arises from the
words, shall afterwards intermarry, which might
seem to import only marriages to be celebrated
in future: that word, afterwards, however, is rather
to be referred to the birth of the children, than
the passage of the act; and no good reason could
possibly have existed with the legislature for varying
the construction of a section, embracing two descriptions of cases standing on a similar foundation." The counsel for the appellants, seizing this

force of this future verb requires that the marriage

word henceforth, and in the commencement. That
the force of this word runs through the whole aet;
and that, used in the clause under consideration, it
would render the retrospective construction of that
clause absurd. In the passage cited, Judge Roane

different question from whether they have actually
done so. The first is purely e legislative question;
the last purely a judicial question, and the only question in the case for the Court.
But it is said, the appellants do not seek to give the
act a retrospective effect; they say that the act, front
the time it took effect, clothed the !appellants with a
new capacity of inheritance, not in relation to rights
previously vested, but in relation to inheritances which
might thereafter fall. Let it be-admitted that their position is such; let it also be admitted, that the legislature had the right to clothe them with such new capacity in relation to future inheritances. But the question still remains, have they done so : is it to persons
in their predicament that this new capacity of inheritance is extended ? We have endeapoured to show
that it is not : whether the Court look to the exposition of the statute by the tribunals of the State,
or whether they look to the construction of the statute, perse. The Court of Appeals of Virginia, while
they admit the application of this statute to antecedent births and marriages, decide that the law applies
to cases only where the father has died posterior to
the passage of the statute. ,The reasoning on which
the Court ground this distinction is not fully developed

equal force both to the marriage and the recogni- Su 'nt.
tion, and corroborates the construction drawn from the
language of the law, that both those facts should be
posterior to the act. It is this: the statute attaches
new legal consequences to the act of marrying a woman by whom the man had, previously, had children;
and to the act of recognizing such children. Make
the law prospective in those particulars, and the citi.
zens for whose goverinent it was intended, have it
in their choice, by performing those acts thereafter,
to incur those consequences or not. But attach those
consequences to a past marriage and recognition, and
you change the legal character of a past transaction
by an cxpostfacto law. By a subsequent law you
attach consequences to an act which did not belong
to it when it was performed. It is precisely for this
reason that ex post facto laws are prohibited; because consequences are attached to an act which did
not belong to them at the time; and which, consequently, could not have entered into his consideration of the question, whether he would commit it or
not. You surprise him by a new case, on which his
judgment was never called to pass, and when it is too
late to retract the step and avoid the new consequences.
S. The next ground taken by the claimants is, that
if they were not legitimated by the 19th section of
the law of descents, they were made capable of inheriting from Richard by the 18th section of that

only gives to the natural children the faculty of inheriting immediately from the mother, and of transmitting such inheritance to their posterity. The legislature has not said, that natural children shall be
considered as lawfully born of their mother for all
the purposes of inheritance pointed out by the act.
It has given them two capacities of inheritance only;
the capacity to inherit on the part of the mother;
and the capacity of transmitting inheritances on the
part of the mother. These capacities, it is true, they
are to enjoy, in like manner "1as if they had been

must arise 'under the first capacity, that of inheriting
on the part of their mother. What is the meaning
of this expression, on the part of their mother ? The
counsel on the other side contends, that it means
firom or through the mother; that it connects the
bastard with the ancestral line of the mother, and
through her, collaterally, with all who are of her
blood. On the other hand, we insist, that the capacity does not go beyond an .inheritancefrom the mother, and the transmission of that inheritance lineally
and collaterally among their descendants; or, in
other words, to make the mother the head of a new
family. The expression "1on the part of the mother," does not carry the mind beyond the mother,
unless connected with words of more extensive significance, such as, ancestors on the part of the mother, or descendants on the part of the mother; and
here it would be the supplemental words which
would produce the effect, not the words, "on the part

furnishes an opposite inference.

The expressions,

scents. It is the only instance in which they do occur, and there they are indisputably synonymous
with "of" and "from" any brother or sister of such
infant on the part of thefather, and so vice versa.
It is said, that this provision places the natural children on the footing of legitimate children to all the
purposes of inheritance. But, we would ask, does
it enable the mother toinheritfrom them ? Does it
enable the mother's ancestors or collateral relations
so to inherit? The provision is, that the natural
children may inheritfrom the mother. But where is
the provision that the mother may inherit from them,
or that her relations may inherit from them ? It is
not to be found; the legislature did not look upwards beyond the mother. It was not their object to
force her natural issue upon a family which she had
dishonoured and offended by bringing them into the
world. That they should have connected them with
her was just and proper; she could not complain.
But to have connected them with a family from which
she had probably been expelled on account of her
infamy, and to have given them a capacity to inherit
the estates of that family, would not have been quite
so just or reasonable. We contend, that thelegislature
have not done it; but that the capacity to transmit applies only to inheritances descending from the mother,
and from each other. Again; ifthe expression, "on the
part of the mother," is of the extent contended for,

then thecapacity-to inherkion the part of the mother,
is a power to take inheritancesfrom, or through her,
in right off'her. But the inheritance claimed is not
of this description; it is a direct inheritancefrom a
mother, which, both at the common law, and under
the statute, is not an *inheritance on the part of"the

not come in her right. So say. the Court in ihe case

The civilians held, that "1this legitimation is a pri.vilege or incident inseparably annexed to the marriage, so that, though bQth ,the children and parents
should wave it, the children would, nevertheless, be
legitimate." The foundation of this doctrine is thus
explained: "Ratio est quia matrimonium subsequens
ex fictione legis retrahitur ad tempus susceptionis i
berorum ut legitimati habeantur legitime suscepti
(i. e.) post contractum"a
If legitimacy is an incident inseparably annexed
to the marriage, it must be the marriage, and not the
agreement of the father, that legitimates the child.
But tlhere can be no such legitimacy without the
agreement or recognition of the father. Agreement
and recognition are not synonymous terms. Recognition implies no more than a simple admission of a
fact; it is in the nature of evidence. Agreement
supposes an assent or compact, from which certain
consequences result, made with a view to those consequences. Recognition refers to something past.
Agreement implies. a transaction from which some
effect is to follow. The provision under consideration consists of an enumeration of facts, and a
declaration- of legal consequences resulting from
those facts.- The facts are, having children by a
'woman, and afterwards marrying her. Upon such
a case the statute operates, and declares the
children legitimate. But the effect follows only

the legal proof of the facts ; and this the statute has
defined. There must be a recognition by the father;
and this is considered a third fact. Though as a
fact it must exist; yet its .existence is only necessary

to establish the first fact; that the husband of the
mother is,. inrverity, the father of the child. No legal consequences can result, until facts are established by proof. We insist, that the terms ",if recognized by him," are'inserted for the single purpose of
defining the proof upon which the material facts
should be established, and are to be regarded only as
prescribing a rule of evidence for the particular case,
Had the legislature -intended this recognition. as one
fact, a principal condition upon which the legitimacy was to be founded, they could easily have connected it with the other facts, so as to have left no
doubt about it. 'The act would have read thus:
"Where a man, having by a woman one or more
children, shall afterwards intermarry with such woman, AND recognize such child or children, they shall
thereby be legitimated." As the wordsnow Stand
in the sentence, they are of very different import.
The two principal facts are first enumerated ;then
proceeding to declare the result, the.mode of proof is
set down, as it were, in a parenthesis, hypothetically,
and indefinite asto time- As much as to say, "when
the father and mother intermarry, if, supose that,
allow that the father recognized the children, they
shall be legitimate." If the recognition of the father
is a principal fact; if the legitimacy is the consequence
of that recognition, the child,ould only be legitimate
from the time of the recognition. This would in-

troduce endless confusion and litigatibn. The rights
of parties would always depend upon the time the
father signified his assent, or declared his agreement.
This never was the doctrine of the civil law. Some
referred the legitimation to the birth, others to the
time of marriage; but all dated, it from the one or
the other of these periods. But as legitimation could
not exist until the celebration of the marriage, we
hold that it must commence at that time, and from
that- time confer rights upon the parties. A recognition before marriage is within the letter of the act.
It supplies evidence as conclusive of the fact to be
established, as if made" after the marriage. Constantine, who introduced this provision into the civil law,
0 is supposed to have intended it as an encouragement to those who had children born in concubinage,
to marry the mother of such offspring.""G But i
our case, the recognition is in fact subsequent to the
marriage.. The will speaks only from the death of
the testator, and is, therefore, a recognition by him at
the time of his death. :The appellants were born
illegitimate. Their father recognized them as his
children. While illegitimate, he declares their mother his wife. He afterwards marries her, and continues to recognize them as his children. He dies.
Then comes an act of the Ieg'islature, the special object of which is, " to protect and provide for the innocent offspring of indiscreet parents, who had already made all the atonement in their power for their
misconduct, by putting the children Whom the father

ready cited are decisive in our favour. It is settled,
that-the act extends to cases of birth and marriage
before its passage ; and it is perfectly clear, that the
enacting part of the act is prospective. The parties
upon whom it is acknowledged to operate, could
claim no rights, but those-which accrued after the
first -of January 1787. It was at that period, and
not before, that their new capacity commenced. We
have shown, that this interpretation of the act interferes with no vested right: And we have shown how
interests in possession may be affected, upon the
principle decided in the Virginia Court of Appeals.
In the view we take of the case, the deathof the
father, before the passage of the act,.is a circumstance of no importance. .It is upon the children,
and. not upon the father, that the act operates. It
attaches upon existing cases, and gives a character
to transactions already,past. Were he alive, he could
not recal the birth, the marriage, or the recognition.
A solemn disavowal of.the children could not restrain
the operation of the law;, for we have shown, that
legitimation results from the facts, and not from the
inclination or pleasure of the father.
The common law rules of succession, both as. to
real and personal estate, were exceedingly narrow
and-illiberal. Where those rules have been enlarged
by statute, Courts have always given the act a liberal interpretation in favour of the persons let irt.

Thus the English statute of distributions was con-

Stevenson's strued to extend to cases of intestacy that happened

before its passage, where administration was granted
Sullivant. afterwards.a No vested right was disturbed by this
interpretation, though it allowed the act a retrospective operation. So in our case, though legitimated
by a law subsequent to their birth, the appellants
claim a new capacity, only in regard to inheritances
that may fall after their legitimacy takes effect. The
appellants do not seek to make themselves heirs to
their father Hugh. They claim that, upon the death
of their b'rother Richard, in 1796, they were his heirs
at law: In making title by descent from a brother,
the father is not noticed at the common law. The
descent is held to be immediate between brothers.
So, by the laws of Virginia and Kentucky, where
the father and mother are both dead, the descent is
cast directly to the brothers and sisters. If this position could at any time have been doubted, it is now
settled by the decision of this Court in the case of
Barnitz's Lessee v. Casey.'
But if the appellants were not legitimated by the
19th section of the act, they claim that they are entitled, as bastards, under the 18th section. When it
is admitted that the act changes the condition of bastards, the extent of that change must be ascertained.
By determining the class of cases included, it can
be best decided what cases are excluded. The Court
are called upon for the first time to put a construction upon this part of the act; and we hold, that
it will not be correct to say, that bastards cannot inHeirs

foundatiohi for the exceptions and limitations set up
by the respondent.
We admit distinctly, that the appellants must take

as bastards, or they cannot take at all. They are
"Iclothed with all the attributes and disabilities of
bastards, except the capacity of inheritance, specially
conferred on them, and conferred on them too as
bastards." What were the disabilities of bastards
at the time the act was passed ? They could not inherit.. In matters of succession and inheritance, they
had no mother, and consequently could have no other
relative., gt except on the single subject of inheritance, the laws recognised and regarded them as
standing in the same relation to their kindred as if
born in we4lock. In contracting marriage, bastards
werp, held to be relations, and prohibited from marrying within the Levitical degrees. In the case of

a prohibition, to stay procee.dings in the Spiritual
Court against Haines, for .mnarying the bastard

And the Court said it had

child of a woman relative. Here the law expressly
recognizes the collateral kindred between the uncle
and his bastard niece. Bastsrds are within the marriage act, which requires the consent of parents or
guardians to the marriage of persons within age.' In

act of 1785 has effected a change in their condition ;
and from the day it took effect, they were in law,
and for the purposes of succession to estates, his brothers and sisters of the -half blood. Had Richard
left brothers and sisters of the whole blood, the 15th
section of the act would expressly embrace their case.
There -was no occasion to make express provision
for the succession of bastards, either in the law of
descents, or in Judge Tucker's table, because the
general provision-for the half blood included their
case. This is clearly the mode of succession contemplated. They shall inherit in like manner as if

callaterals.
The common law disabilities of bastards are, like
the canons of descent, of feudal origin : for it must
be remembered that this disability relates entirely to
inheritance. Escheats are the fruits and consequences, as Blackstone says, of feudal tenure resulting from the frequent extinction of heritable blood,
according to the feudal tenure of inheritance. A
bastard, being the son of nobody, could have no
heritable blood, consequently none of the blood of
the first purchaser. The feudal doctrine of carrying
the estate through the blood of the first purchaser,
inevitably excluded inheritance among bastards. In
this sense' the disability of bastards was the consequence of feudal policy, and totally inconsistent
with the liberal andi equitablecanons of descent, introduced by the act of 1785. The preference of
the iale ascending line, preserved by the statute of
1786, is not founded upon feudal doctrines. The
inheritance is directed first to the father ; not because
he is the most worthy of blood, but because he is
the head of the family, who can best dispose of the
estate among his surviving children: ,And upon this
same principle the grandfather is preferred to the
grandmothers and aunts. This is no prefetence of
the male ancestors ; but simply a preference of the
husband or father, if in existence, to the wife or
children of the same person; and the principle of

The principle of extinguishing the inheritable blood,
applied to each case. The first was cut up by the
constitution of Virginia. The act of 1785 laid the
axe to the root of the other two. Not by authorizing aliens to hold lands, or by legitimating bastards.
In the one case it permits a citizen, claiming by descent, to trace his relation to an intestate through an
alien. In the other, it confers a capacity of inheritable blood upon bastards. The object of both provisions is the same: to enable the kindred of the intestate to 'obtain the property he left, instead of rapaciously seiziig it for the government. The act
is clearly remedial, and should be construed liberally
in furtherance of the object of the legislature, conformable to the opinions of the Virginia Courts already quoted.

coincides, that Hugh Stephenson, though the meritoious cause of the grant of this land, never took any
interest therein, but that the right to the same vested
in his son Richard, to whom the warrants issued, as

construction of the latter law. The opinion of the
Court, therefore, is founded on this law.
The appellants object to the decree of the Court

described them as the legal representatives of Hugh
Stephenson, for whose benefit the grant was intended; and then, they would have taken exclusively
under the act, by force of such legislative description, and not under, or in virtue of the description
in the will. It is not likely that the expression, "legal representatives," in the act, was meant to apply
to devisees of deceased officers and soldiers for whom
the bounty was intended, if they had lived, because,
at the time this law was passed, there could not be a
devisor of those lands under the general law. It is
more probable that they were intended to provide
for the case of a person who may have purchased
the right of the officer or soldier to such bounty as
the legislature might grant to him.

having by a woman one or more children, shall afterwards intermarry with such woman, such child or
children, if recognized by him, shall be thereby legitimated."
There can be no doubt but that the section applied
to bastards in esse, at the time the law came into
operation, as well as to such as might thereafter be
born. But it is contended by the counsel for the
appellants, that the section is, in every other respect,
prospective, not only as to the fact of legitimation,
but as to the two circumstances of marriage and recognition, which entitle the bastard to the benefits
of the law; and, consequently, that to bring a case
within the operation of this section, both the marriage and recognition must take place after the Ist of
January, 1787. On the other side, it is admitted,
that the privilege of legitimation is not conferred
upon a bastard prior to the above period; but it is
insisted, that, as to the marriage and recognition, the
law should be construed as well retrospectively as
prospectively.
. In the case of Rice v. Efford, decided in the Court
of Appeals of Virginia,a the marriage took place
priorto the 1st of January, 1787, but the father recognized his illegitimate children, and died, after
that period. The whole Court seem to have been
of opinion, that the word 11 afterwards" referred not
to a time subsequent to the 1st of January, 1787,
but to the birth of the children, and, therefore, that

It is contended by the.counsel for the appellants,
that since, in the above case, the father recognized
the children subsequent to the 1st of January, 1787,
this opinion of Judge Roane as to the tinie of the
recognition, was unnecessarily advanced, and is,
therefore, entitled to no higher respect than what is
due to a mere obiter dictum. Be this as it may, it
is the uncontradicted opinion of a learned Judge
upon the construction of a law of his own State;
and is noticed by this Court, not upon the ground of
its being considered in that State as of conclusive
authority, but because it strongly fortifies the'opinion
which this Court entertains upon the point decided;
which is, that, however the construction may he as
to the inception of the right, it is clearly prospective
as it relates to the consummation of it. And this
prospective operation being given to the act, by requiring the most important condition upon which
the privilege of legitimation is to be conferred, to be
performed after the law came into operation,.it is
less material whether the marriage was celebrated
before, or after that period. To renler the past recognition of the father effectual to give inheritable
,blood to his children,- who were then illegitimate,
and incapable of taking the estate by descent, either

which this question arises, is as follows: 1 In making title by descent, it shall be no bar to a party

Bastards also shall be capable of inheriting or of

In the construction of this section, it isnever to be

common law subjects them, as such, except those
from which the section itself exempts them.' Though
illegitimate, they may inherit and transmit inheritance, on the part of the mother, in like manner as if
they had been lawfully begotten of the mother. What
is the legal exposition of these expressions ? We
understand it to be, that they shall have a capacity to
take real property by descent immediately or through
their mother in the ascending line; and transmit the
same to their line as descendants, in like manner as

these respects, quasi legitimate, they are, nevertheless, in all* others -bastards, and as such, they have,

a The history of the respective disabilities and rights of ille.
gitimate children, in different ages and nations, is a subject of
curious speculation. The most ancient people of whose laws
and political institutions we have any accurate knowledge are
the Jews. They appur to make little or no distinction between their legitibate and illegitimate offspring. So, also, the
Greeks, in the heroic ages, seem to have regarded them 2s
in every respect equal: but at a subsequent epoch they were.
stigmatized with various marks of unfavourable distinction.
Among the Athenians, the offspring of parents who hail con-.
tracted marriages, which though valid by the law of nations,
were contrary to the policy and the positive institutions of
the state, were considered as illegitimate; and all bastards
were not only deemed incapable of inheriting from either of
their parents, but excluded from public honours and offices,
Thus, the citiand regarded as aliens to the commonwealth.
zen who married a foreign woman at once degraded and denationalized his offspring.a The severity of this law was however occasionally -mitigated from motives of policy ; and when
the ranks of the citizens of a Grecian republic became thinned
by wars and proscriptions, they were filled up again from this
disfranchised class. (Arst. Politic. 1. 3. c. 3. Id. 1. 6. c. 4.)
The Roman law distinguished between the offspring of that
concubinage which it tolerated as an inferior species of marriage, and " the spurious brood of adultery, prostitution, and incest." (Gibbon's Decl. + Fall, 4-c. c. 44. s. 1.) The former
were termed naturales; and the latter, spurii, adulterini, inces.
tuosi, nefarii, or sacrilegi,according as they were respectively
the fruit of prostitution, of incest between persons in the direct line of consanguinity, or related ih remoter degrees, and

of the civilians,

classes of persons who could not lawfully be concubines, either
in respect to the infamy of their characters, st meretrices; or in
respect to their rank in life, ut ingenue et illustres ; or in respect to their condition as married women, or nuns professed,
or as within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity. ((,uvres

de D'.Aguesseau, ubi supra.)

Although bastards were not. deprived of any civil rights by
the Roman law, and "the outcasts of every family were adopted without reproach as the children of the state," yet they
were excluded in the early ages of the republic from all .claim
to the property of their deceased parents. As the law of the
XII Tables only called to the succession the agnates, or the per.
sons connected by a line of males of the same gens or "fimily ;

Cod. Thcodo. L. 1. De natural. filiis.) Be this as it may,
it is certain that the Emperor. Valentinian, A. D. 371, permitted
the bastard children of fathers, who had also legitimate offspring,
to acquire either by donation or will, one-twelfth part of the paternal property; and in case the father had no legitimate children, or surviving parents, he might dispose in the same manner
of one-fourth of his estate in favour of his illegitimate children.
(Cod. Theodos. 1. 1. De natural. liberis.) Justinian again permitzed those who had both legitimate and illegitimate children to give
or bequeath one-twelfth part of their property to the latter ; and
in case they had no legitimate children, to make the same disposition of a moiety of their estate. (01ovell. 18. c. 5. PothierPandect. in Nov. Ordin. Redact. tomn. 2. p. 55.) He afterwards
permitted them, in case they had no legitimate children, nor fatler or mother, "quibus necessitas est legis relinquere partem
proprim substantim competentem," to leave the whole of their
property to their illegitimate offspring ; and in case their father
or mother survived, the whole, except what the parents were
entitled to by law. (Novell. 89. c. 12.) Justinian also established, for the first time in the Roman jurisprudence, the
principle of giving to illegitimate children a legal'claim to a
portion of their fathers's property by inheritance ab intestato,
by providing, that in case the father died intestate, leaving
neither wife nor legitimate offspring, his natural children and
their mother should be entitled to one-sixth part of his estate.
(cEuvres de D'Aguesseau, tom. 7. 389.) This, however, must be
understood strictly of the children born in concubinage, such
as the Roman law recognized this domestic relation ; and not
9f " the spurious brood of adultery, prostitution, and incest,
to whom, (according to Gibbon,) Justinian reluctantly granted
the necessary aliments of life :" but from whom it would, in
fact, appear that he inhumanly withheld even this provision.

that this provision for the necessary support of illegitimate
children was confined to those termed naturales. (lb.)
The stern contempt of the early Roman legislators for the
female *ex .a~d entirely excluded the cognates from the rights
of inheritance, "as strangers and aliens." This necessarily
prevented even legitimate children from succeeding to their
mother ; and it is not, therefore, surprising that bastards could
claim no part of the maternal estate. When the rigour of this
principle was relaxed by the equitable interference of the prmtor, his edict called indiscriminately to the succession both the
legitimate and illegitimate chidrp of the motheT. ((Euvres de
Nov. 'Ordin.
D'JAguesseau, tom. 7. p. 391. Pothier.Pandect. iln
Redc. torn. 2. p. 557.) This rule was subsequently confirmed
by the Tertullian and Orphitian senatus consulta, and .continued
the law of the empire ever afterwards, except that Justinian
engrafted into it an exception unfavourable to the illegitimate
,children of noble women, mulieres illustrx. (Lb.)
The Roman law had provided various modes by which has.
tards might he legitimated. 1. The first was by a subsequent
marriage of the father and mother; a mode of l.egitimation first
established by Constantine. 2. Per oblatioaezu curiw, a mode
introduced by Theodosius and Valentinian, which was when the
parent consecrated his child to the service of a city. But this
only had the effect of legitimating the children - in regard to
tlieirfather. .Tbey had no right to inheritfror collaterals, and
even their claim to inherit from their father was confined to
his property within the city to yrhose service they were deyated. 3. Adoption alone was declared by the emperor Anastasis to be sufficient to legitimate the natural children of the

and Justinian. 4. By the last will of the flither, confirmed by

cognition of the father ; as if the father designated one of his
natural children as his child in any public or private instrument i this had the effect of legitimating the child thus ac-

knowledged, and all his brothers and sisters by the same mother, upon a legal presumption, that a marriage might have
been contracted between the parents. In all these cases, except
the 2d, the children thus legitimated were in all respects placed
upon the same footing as if born in lawful wedlock. (Euvres
de D'Jlguesseau, tom. 7. p. 393. and seq. Potler, Pandect. in
Xbov. Ord. Redact. toin. 1.p. '27.)
It should be added, that none of these modes of legitimation
could apply to the offspring of criminal commerce, ex damnato
coitu ; since they all suppose that the children are born of a
concubine with whom the father might lawfully intermarry.
(Euvres de D'Aguesseau, ubi supra.)
By the Roman law if a bastard left legitimate children, they
became his heirs precisely as if he himself had been legitimate. But if he died, without having been himself legitimated,
and without children, his succession was determined by the
riole of reciprocity, and his father and mother, &c.succeeded
ts him, precisely as he would have succeeded to them. If he
had been legitimated while living, his succession was regulated
in the same manner with that of persons born in lawful wedlock. (I.p. 399.)
By the Canon law, the subject of bastardy was, in general,
regulated in the same manner as by the Civil law. But though
bastards were capable by the latter of aspiring to all the honours and offices of the State, the former refused them the same
privileges in respect to the dignities of the -church. The canonists also aimed to exclude them entirely from the succession
of their father or mother, but allowed all indiscriminately a
right to claim the necessary aliments of life, After legitima!ion in any of the modes provided by the civil law, such as a

regulate the rights and disabilities of illegitimate children in
the same manner as they are determined by the civil and common law. But the Gothic monarchies of Europe adopted from
the earliest times a legislation on this subject, in many respects
different from that of imperial and papal Rome. Thus, in all
the provinces of France, where the droit coutoutnier, or unwritten law, prevailed, bastards were incapable of inheriting ab
intestato, except the property of their legitimate children, and
the reciprocal right of the husband and wife to succeed to each
other according to the title of the civil law, unde vir et uzor.
This'was the universal law of the kingdom, with the exception
of the peculiar customs of a few provinces, and the pays du
droit ecrit, where the Roman law constituted the municipal
code. (Ferriere. Dict. Mot. Bastard. (Euvres de D'.guesseau,
tom. 7. pp. 403. 430. 448.)
They were, also, with the exception of certain local cus:
toms, incapable of taking by devise from their parents, except
des donations moderies pourleur alimens et entretiens. (Ferriere.
Dict. ubi supra. (Euvres de D'.Aguesseau, tom. 7. p. 431.)
The king was the heir of all bastards dying without legitimate children, or without having disposed of their property
by donation inter vivos, or last will and testament, in the same
manner as he inherited the estates of aubains, or aliens, dying
in the kingdom. (lb.) Of the various modes of legitimation
known to the civil law, that of France adopted only two,
1. that by a subsequent marriage of the parents, and 2. by au*thority of the prince. (Euvr. de D'Aguesseau, tom. 7.p. 437.
The bastard who was legitimated by the subsequent marriage
of his parents, was placed upon the same footing as if born in
*lawful wedlock, as to personal rights, and those of property;
but he who was legitimated by authority of the prince, par
lettre du prince, although capable of aspiring to civil honours
and offices, was incapable of inheriting, or transmitting proper-

ty by inheritance. (Id. p. 462.) Such was the law of France
the revolution ; but it was greatly modified by the compilers of the new civil code, who retained but one mode of
legititation, that by a subsequent marriage and recognition of
the parents. (Code-.j'apoL~on, art. 331, 332, 333.) Illegiti-

mate children, legally recognized as such, are entitled, in case
their father shall have left legitimate descendants, to one third
of the portion to which they would have been entitled had
they been legitimate; in case the former shall have left no descendants, but only kindred in the ascending line, or brothers
or sisters, to a moiety of the same; and in case the parents
shall have left neither descendants, nor kindred in the ascending line, nor brothers or sisters, to three fourths of the same
portion. (lb. art. 757.) They have a right to the whole of
their parents' property where the latter shall have left no kindred within the degrees of succession. (lb. art. '758.) Their
descendants are entitled to the same.rigbts, jule representationis.
(lb. art. 759.) But bastards are not entitled in any case to
succeed'to the relations of their parents; (lb. art. 756.) and
none of these provisions are applicable to bastards, the fruit of
incestuous or adulterous intercourse, who are only entitled to
necessary aliments. (lb. art. 762, 763, 764.) The proper y
of bastards leaving no posterity, is inherited by the parents
who shall have recognized them. (lb. art. 765.) And-in case
the -arents are deceased, the property received from them, is
inherited by the legitimate brothers and sisters of the bastard;
and all his other property by bis illegitimate brothers and sisters, or their descendants. (lb. art. 766.)
By the law of Scotland, the king succeeds as ltimus hmres,
to the estates of bastards, and they cannot dispose of their property by will, unless to their lawful issue, without letters of
legitimation. But these letters do not enable the bastard to
succeed to his natural father, to the exclusion of lawful heirs ;
for the king cannot, by any prerogative, cut off the private -right
of third parties. But he may, by a specia 6lause in the -letters of legitimation, renounce his right -to the bastard's succession, in lavour of him who wopld have been the bastard's heir
