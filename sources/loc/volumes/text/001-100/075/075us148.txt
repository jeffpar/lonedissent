llINSO0N v. LOTT.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.
NOTE.

At the same time with the preceding case was decided
another from the same court, much like it in general principle; the case of
HINSON V. LOTT.
1. The principal of the preceding decision affirmed and applied to a case,
where, although the mode of collecting the tax on the article made in the
State was different from the mode of collecting the tax on the articles
brought from another State into it, yet the amount paid was, in fact, the
same on the same article in whatever State made.
2. The effect of the act being such as just described, it was held to institute
no legislation which discriminated against the products of sister States,
but merely to subject them to the same rate of taxation which similar
articles paid that were manufactured within the State; and accordingly
that it was not an attempt to regulate commerce, but an appropriate and
legitimate exercise of the taxing power of the States.

THE case was this: With the same provisions of the Constitution as are quoted in the last case in force (supra,p. 123)
the State of Alabama passed a statute, approved February
22d, 1866, which, by its 13th section, enacted:
"Before it shall be lawful for any dealer or dealers in spirituous
liquors to offer any such liquors for sale within the limits of this
State, such dealer or dealers introducing any such liquors into the
State for sale shall first pay the tax-collector of the county into
-which such liquors are introduced, a tax of fifty cents per gallon
upon each and every gallon thereof."
Two subsequent sections, the 14th and 15th, provided the
mode of enforcing the collection of the tax thus imposed.
Previous sections of the statute, it ought to be mentioned,
laid a tax of fifty cents per gallon on all whiskey and all
brandy from fruits mam fac lured in the State, and in order to
collect this tax, enacted that every distiller should take out
a license and make regular returns of the amount of distilled
spirits manufactured by him. On this he was to pay the
fifty cents per gallon.
With this statute in force, Iinson, a merchant of Mobile,
filed a bill against the tax-collector for the city of Mobile,
and State of Alabama, in which he set forth that he had

on hand five barrels of whiskey consigned to him by one
Dexter, of the State of Ohio, to be sold on account of the
latter in the State of Alabama, and that he had five other
barrels, purchased by himself in the State of Louisiana, and
that he had brandy and wine imported from abroad (upon
which he had paid the import duties laid by the United
States, at the custom-house at Mobile), all of which liquors
he now held and was offering for sale in the same packages
in which they were imported, and not otherwise; that the
tax-collector was about to enforce the collection of State and
county taxes on the said liquors, for which he set up the
authority of the 13th, 14th and 15th sections of the already
quoted act of the Alabama legislature, Hinson insisted that
this act was void as being in conflict with the Constitution
of the United States, and prayed an injunction. The defendant demurred.
On final hearing, in the Supreme Court of Alabama, that
court gave an elaborate opinion. Referring to the clause
of the Constitution, which says, that "Congress shall have
power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among
the several States," it admitted that opinions were to be
found in the reports of the Federal courts that the power
was exclusive; but that the better opinions were otherwise;
and while, if Congress exercised this power, all conflicting
legislation would give way, yet, subject to the superior power
in Congress, the States might legislate. It proceeded:
"There is no act of Congress with which a State tax upon
liquor, introduced from other States, can interfere, and, therefore,
it is permissible for the State to impose a tax upon the sale of
liquor introduced from another State. Such a tax is not only
constitutional, but it is obviously just and proper, for a tax to the
same extent is imposed upon liquor manufactured in the State.
"It is admitted that the law under consideration is broad
enough to apply to liquors imported from foreign countries, but

it is void only so far as itis in collision with the a6ts of Congress
on that subject."
Accordingly, the relief prayed was granted .as to all but
the State tax, and relief as to that was granted as to goods

imported from abroad, but the State tax of fifty cents per
gallon on the whiskey of Dexter, of Ohio, and that purchased
by plaintiff in Louisiana was held to be valid.
The case was now here for review. And was argued (like
the last one, though being after it, less fully) by Mr.J. A. Campbell,
for the plaintiff in error, and by M.1r. P. Phillips, contra: little
reference being made to other sections of the statute than
the 13th.
Mr. Campbell contended that this 13th section of the act
in question was a plain violation of the Constitution ; as well
of that provision of it which says that "no State shall levy
any imposts on imports," as of that other which declares
"that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the
immunities and privileges of citizens of the several States."
Moreover, the State act regulated inter-state commerce.
Mr. Justice MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
In the argument of this case no reference has been made
to any other section than the 13th of the statute in question.
If this section stood alone in the legislation of Alabama
on the subject of taxing liquors, the effect of it would be
that all such liquors brought into the State from other States
and offered for sale, whether in the original casks by which
they came into the State or by retail in smaller quantities,
would be subject to a heavy tax, while the same class of
liquors manufactured in the State would escape the tax. It
is obvious that the right to impose any such discriminating
tax, if it exist at all, cannot be limited in amount, and that
a tax under the same authority can as readily be laid which
would amount to an absolute prohibition to sell liquors introduced from without while the privilege would remain unobstructed in regard to articles made in the State. If this can be
done in reference to liquors, it can be done with reference to
all the products of a sister State, and in this mode one State
can establish a complete system of non-intercourse in her
commercial relations with all the other States of the Union.

18HINSON
V. LOTT.
Opinion of the court.

mediately preceding, that the constitutional provision against
taxing imports by the States does not extend to articles
brought from a sister State. But if this were otherwise,
and we could hold that as to such articles the rule laid down
in Brozon v. Mar-yland, concerning foreign imports, applied,
it would prevent but a very little of the evil which we have
described; for, under the decision in that case, it is only
while the goods so imported were held in the original unbroken condition in which they came into the State, and in
the hands of the first importer, that they would be protected
from State taxation.: As soon as they passed out of his
hands into use, or were offered for sale among the community at large, they would be liable to a tax which might
render theik use or sale impossible.
But while the case has been argued here with a principal
reference to the supposed prohibition against taxing imports,
it is to be seen from the opinion of the Supreme Court of
Alabama delivered in this case, that the clause of the Constitution which gives to Congress the right to regulate commerce among the States, was supposed to present a serious
objection to the validity of the Alabama statute. Nor can
it be doubted that a tax which so seriously affects the interchange of commodities betw6eu the States as to essentially
impede or seriously interfere with it, is a regulation of commerce. And it is also true, as conceded in that opinion, that
Congress has the same right to regulate commerce among
the States that it has to regulate commerce with foreign
nations, and that whenever it exercises that power, all conflicting State laws must give way, and that if Congress had
made any regulation covering the matter in question we need
inquire no further.
That court seems to have relieved itself of the objection
by holding that the tax imposed by the State of Alabama
was an exercise of the concurrent right of regulating commerce remaining with the States until some regulation on
the subject had been made by Congress. But, assuming
the tax to be, as we have supposed, a discriminating tax,
levied exclusively upon the products of sister States; and

HINSON v. LOTT.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

looking to the consequences which the exercise of this power
may produce if it be once conceded, amounting, as we have
seen, to a total abolition of all commercial intercourse between the States, under the cloak of the taxing power, we
are not prepared to admit that a State can exercise such a
power, though Congress may have failed to act on the subject
in any manner whatever.
The question of the nature of the power to regulate commerce and how far that power is exclusively vested in Congress, has always been a difficult one, and has seldom been
construed in this court with unanimity. In the very latest
case on this subject, Crandall v. NAevada,* the Chief Justice
and Mr. Justice Clifford held that a tax on persons passing
through the State by 'railroads or other public conveyances
was forbidden to the States by that provision of the Constitution proprio vigore, and in the absence of any legislation by
Congress on the subject; while a majority of the court, preferring to place the invalidity of the tax on other grounds,
merely expressed their inability, on a review of the cases
previously decided, to take that view of the question. But
in that case the opinion of the court in Cooley v. The Port
Wardens was approved, which holds that there is a class of
legislation of a general nature, affecting the commercial interests of all the States, which, from its essential character, is
National, and which must, so far as it affects these interests,
belong exclusively to the Federal government.
The tax in the case before us, if it were of the character
we have suggested, discriminating adversely to the products
of all the other States in favor of those of Alabama, and
involving a principle which might lead to actual commercial
non-intercourse, would, in our opinion, belong to that class
of legislation and be forbidden by the clause of the Constitution just mentioned.
But a careful examination of that statute shows that it is
not obnoxious to this objection. A tax is imposed by the
previous sections of the same act of fifty cents per gallon on

Syllabus.

all whiskey and all brandy from fruits manufactured in the
State. In order to collect this tax, every distiller is compelled
to take out a license and to make regular returns of the
amount of distilled spirits manufactured by him. On this
he pays fifty cents per gallon. So that when we come in the
light of these earlier sections of the act, to examine the 13th,
14th, and 15th sections, it is found that no greater tax is laid
on liquors brought into the State than on those manufactured
within it. And it is clear that whereas collecting the tax of
the distiller was supposed to be the most expedient mode of
securing its payment, as to liquors manufactured within the
State, the tax on those who sold liquors brought in from
other States was only the complementary provision necessary to make the tax equal on all liquors sold in the State.
As the effect of the act is such as we have described, and it
institutes no legislation which discriminates against the products of sister States, but merely subjects them to the same
rate of taxation which similar articles pay that are manufactured within the State, we do not see in it an attempt to
regulate commerce, but an appropriate and legitimate exercise of the taxing power of the States.
