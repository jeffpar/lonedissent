UNION PACIFIC) RAILROAD COMPANY V. UNITED STATES.
CENTRAL PACIFIC RAILROA.D CoinA.Y v. GALLATiN.
1. So far as it establishes in the treasury of the United States a sinking-fund,
the act of Congress approved May 7, 1878 (20 Stat. 56), entitled "An Act
to alter and amend the act entitled 'An Act to aid in the construction of a
railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean,
and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military,
and other purposes,' approved July 1, 1862, and also to alter and amend the
act of Congress approved July 2, 1864, in amendment of said first-named
act," is not unconstitutional.
2. The debt of tihe respective companies therein named to the United States is
not paid by depositing and investing the fund in the manner prescribed by
that act
3. Retaining in the fund the one-half of the earnings for services rendered to the
government by the respective companies, which, by the act of July 2, 1864
(13 Stat. 356), was to be paid, does not release the government from such
payment. Although kept in the treasury, the fund is owned by them, and
they will be entitled to the securities whereof it consists which remain
undisposed of when the debts chargeable upon it shall be paid. Under the
circumstances, such retaining is, in law, a payment to them.
4. The establishment of the fund is a reasonable regulation of the admninistration of the affairs of the companies, promotive alike of the interests of the
public and of the corporators, and is warranted under the authority which
Congress has, by way of amendment, to change or modify the rights, privileges, and immunities granted by it.
5. The right of amendment, alteration, or repeal reserved by Congress in said acts
of 1862 and 1864 considered.
6. The legislation of Congress in relation to the Central Pacific Railroad Company and the Western Pacific Railroad Company - the latter now by consolidation a part of the former -considered, and held, 1. That, to the extent
of the powers, rights, privileges, and immunities thereby granted, Congress
retains the right of amendment, and by exercising it may, in a manner not
inconsistent with tile original charter granted by California, as modified
by the act of that State passed in 1864, accepting what had been done by
Congress, regulate the administration of the affairs of the company in
reference to tlte debts created by it under authority of such legislation.
2. That the establishment of tIme sinking-fund by the act of May 7, 1878
(supra), does not conflict with any thing in said charter.

2. That the amount and value of said service so rendered
by the claimant for the defendant, as stated in proposition

payment of bonds issued by the United States to said company, or to the interest thereon, and against the retention of
said one-half by the United States on any account whatever.
5. That on the fourth day of November, 1878, the proper

isprosecuted.
The court adjudged that the petition be dismissed, and the
.company thereupon appealed.
Gallatin, a stockholder of the Central Pacific Railroad Company, filed his bill against it and the persons constituting its
board of directors, to compel them to comply with the requirements of the said act of May 7, 1878. He alleges that the
board has threatened to disregard them, and that, Aug. 27,
1878, it declared a dividend of one per cent upon the capital
stock of the company payable out of the earnings accumulated
since June 80, 1878, although the company was then in default in respect of the payment of five per cent of the net earnings as required by the said act; that one of the consequences
of its conduct, if persisted in, will be a forfeiture of the company's property and franchises, to his irreparable injury. He
prays for an injunction to restrain the directors from paying
*adividend while the company is in default in respect to any
of the terms, requirements, or provisions of said act, and from
doing any other or further thing whatever in the premises in

on their declining to answer, the court passed a decree in
conformity with the prayer of the bill. They thereupon
appealed.

"An Act to aid in carrying out the Pacific Railroadand Telegraph
Act of Congress and other matters relating thereto.
"The people of the State of California, represented in Senate
and Assembly, do enact as follows: "SECT. 1. Whereas, by the provisions of an act of Congress, entitled ' An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph
line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to
the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other
purposes, approved July 1, 1862,' the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California is authorized to construct a railroad and telegraph line in the State of California, and in the Territories lying
east of said State towards the Missouri River; therefore, to enable
the said company more fully and completely to comply with and
perform the provisions and conditions of said act of Congress, the
said company, their successors and assigns, are hereby authorized
and empowered, and the right, power, and privilege is hereby
granted to, conferred upon, and vested in them to construct, maintain, and operate the said railroad and telegraph line not only in the
State of California, but also in the said Territories lying east of and
between said State and the Missouri River, with such branches and
extensions of said railroad and telegraph line, or either of them, as
said company may deem necessary or proper; and also the right
of way for said railroad and telegraph line over any lands belonging
to this State, and on, over, and along any streets, roads, highways,
rivers, streams, waters, and watercourses, but the same to be so
constructed as not to obstruct or destroy the passage or navigation

of the same; and also the right to condemn and appropriate to the
use of said company such private property, rights, privileges, and
franchises as may be proper, necessary, or convenient for the purposes of said railroad and telegraph, the compensation therefor to
be ascertained and paid under and by special proceedings, as prescribed in the act providing for the incorporation of railroad companies, approved March 20, 1861, and the acts supplementary and
amendatory thereof; said company to be subject to all the laws of
this State concerning railroad and telegraph lines, except that messages and property of the United States, of this State, and of the
said company, shall have priority of transportation and transmission

laws inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this act, or the

"SCT. 2. This act shall take effect and be in force from and

The State of Nevada, March 9, 1866 (the Territory of that
name having in the mean time become a State), passed, mutatis

State for 1866, e. 112.
The cases were heard at the same time.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WAITB delivered the opinion of the
court.
The single question presented by the case of the Union Pacific Railroad Company is as to the constitutionality of that
part of the act of May 7, 1878, which establishes in the treasury of the United States a sinking-fund. The -validity of the
rest of the act is not necessarily involved.
It is our duty, when required in the regular course of Judicial proceedings, to declare an act of Congress void if not within
the legislative power of the United States; but this declaration
should never be made except in a clear case. Every possible
presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this
continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt.
One branch of- the government cannot encroach on the domain
of another without danger. The safety of our institutions
depends in no small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule.
The United States cannot any more than a State interfere
with private rights, except for legitimate governmental purposes.
They are not included within the constitutional prohibition
which prevents States from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts, but equally with the States they are prohib-

ited from depriving persons or corporations of property without
due process of law. They cannot legislate back to themselves,
without making compensation, the lands they have given this
corporation to aid in the construction of its railroad. Neither
can they by legislation compel the corporation to discharge its
obligations in respect to the subsidy bonds otherwise than
according to the terms of the contract already made in that
connection. The United States are as much bound by their
contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had
been a State or a niunicipality or a citizen. No change can be
made in the title created by the grant of the lands, or in the
contract for the subsidy bonds, without the consent of the
corporation. All this is indisputable.
The contract of the company in respect to the subsidy bonds
is to pay both principal and interest when the principal matures, unless the debt is sooner discharged by the application
of one-half the compensation for transportation and other services rendered for the government, and the five per cent of net
earnings as specified in the charter. This was decided in
Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 91 U. S. 72.
The precise point to be determined now is, whether a statute
which requires the company in the management of its affairs
to set aside a portion of its currefit income as a sinking-fund
to meet this and other mortgage debts when they mature,
deprives the company of its property without due process of
law, or in any other way improperly interferes with vested
rights.
This corporation is a creature of the United States. It is a
private corporation created for public purposes, and its property is to a large extent devoted to public uses. It is, therefore, subject to legislative control so far as its business affects
the public interests. Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Bailroad
Co. v. Iowa, 94 U. S. 155.
It is unnecessary to decide what power Congress would have
had over the charter if the right of amendment had not been
reserved; for, as we think, that reservation has been made.
In the act of 1862, sect. 18, it was accompanied by an explan-

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

atory statement showing that this had been done "the better to accomplish the object of this act, namely, to promote
the public interest and welfare by the construction of said
railroad and telegraph line, and keeping the same in working
order, and to secure to the government at all times (but
especially in time of war) the use and benefits of the same for
postal, military, and other purposes," and by an injunction
that it should be used with "due regard for the rights of said
companies." In the act of 1864, however, there is nothing
except the simple words (sect. 22) " that Congress may at any
time alter, amend, and repeal this act." Taking both acts
together, and giving the explanatory statement in that of 1862
all the effect it can be entitled to, we are of the opinion that
Congress not only retains, but has given special notice of its
intention to retain, full and complete power to make such
alterations and amendments of the charter as come within the
just scope of legislative power. That this power has a limit,
no one can doubt. All agree that it cannot be used to take
away property already acquired under the operation of the
charter, or to deprive the corporation of the fruits actually
reduced to possession of contracts lawfully made ; but, as was
said by this court, through Mr. Justice Clifford, in Miller v.
The State (15 Wall. 498), "it may safely be affirmed that
the reserved power may be exercised, and to almost any extent,
to carry into effect the original purposes of the grant, or to
secure the due administration of its affairs, so as to protect the
rights of stockholders and of creditors, and for the proper disposition of its assets; " and again, in .Holyoke Uompany v. Lyman (id. 519), "to protect the rights of the public and of the
corporators, or to promote the due administration of the affairs
of the corporation." Mr. Justice Field, also speaking for the
court, was even more explicit when, in Tomlinson, v. Jessul)
(id. 459), he said, "the reservation affects the entire relation
between the State and the corporation, and places under legislative control all rights, privileges, and immunities derived by
its charter directly from the State;" and again, as late as Railroad Company v. Maine (96 U. S. 510), "by the reservation
. . . the State retained the power to alter it [the charter] in
all particulars constituting the grant to the new company,

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND CASES.

formed under it, of corporate rights, privileges, and immuini:
ties." Mr. Justice Swayne, in Shields v. Ohio (95 U. S. 324),
says, by way of limitation, " The alterations must be reasonable; they must be made in good faith, and be consistent with
-the object and scope of the act of incorporation. Sheer oppression and wrong cannot be inflicted under the guise of amendment or alteration." The rules as here laid down are fully
sustained by authority. Further citations are unnecessary.
Giving full effect to the principles which have thus been
authoritatively stated, we think it safe to say, that whatever,
rules Congress might have prescribed in the original charter
for the government of the corporation in the administration
of its affairs, it retained the power to establish by amendment.
In so doing it cannot undo what has already been done, and
it cannot unmake contracts that have already been made, but
it may provide for what shall be done in the future, and may
direct what preparation shall be made for the due performance
of contracts already entered into. It might originally have
prohibited the borrowing of money on mortgage, or it might
have said that no bonded debt should be created without ample
provision by sinking-fund to meet it at maturity. Not having
done so at first, it cannot now by direct legislation vacate
mortgages already made under the powers originally granted,
nor release debts already contracted. A prohibition now
against contracting debts will not avoid debts already incurred.
An amendment making it unlawful to issue bonds payable at
a distant day, without at the same time establishing a fund for.
their ultimate redemption, will not invalidate a bond already
out. All such legislation will be confined in its operation to
the future.
Legislative control of the administration of the affairs of a
corporation may, however, very properly include regulations
by which suitable provision will be secured in advance for the
payment of existing debts when they fall due. If a State under
its reserved power of charter amendment were to provide that
no dividends should be paid to stockholders from current earnings until some reasonable amount had been set apart to meet
maturing obligations, we think it would not be seriously contended that such legislation was unconstitutional, either because,

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Slip. Ct.

it impaired the obligations of the charter contract or deprived
the corporation of its property without due process of law.
Take the case of an insurance company dividing its unearned
premiums among its stockholders without laying by any thing
to meet losses, would any one doubt the power of the State'
under its reserved right of amendment to prohibit such dividends until a suitable fund had been established to meet losses
from outstanding risks? Clearly not, we think, and for the
obvious reason that while stockholders are entitled to receive
all dividends that may-legitimately be declared and paid out
of the current net income, their claims on the property of the
corporation are always subordinate to those of creditors. The
property of a corporation constitutes the fund from which its
debts are to be paid, and if the officers improperly attempt to
divert this fund from its legitimate uses, justice requires that
they should in some way be restrained. A court of equity
would do this, if called upon in an appropriate manner; and it
needs no argument to show that a legislative regulation which
-requires no more of the corporation than a court would compel
it to do without legislation is not unreasonable.
Such a regulation, instead of being destructive in its character, would be eminently conservative. Railroads are a peculiar species of property, and railroad corporations are in some
respects peculiar corporations. A large amount of money is
required for construction and equipment, and this to a great extent is represented by a funded debt, which, as well as the
capital stock, is sought after for investment, and is distributed
widely among large numbers of persons. Almost as a matter
of necessity it is difficult to secure any concert of action among
the different classes of creditors and stockholders, and consequently all are compelled to trust in a great degree to the
management of the corporation by those who are elected as
officers, without much, if any, opportunity for personal supervision. The interest of the stockholders, who, as 'a rule, alone
have the power to select the managers, is not unfrequently
antagonistic to those of the debt-holders, and it therefore is
especially proper that the government, whose creature the corporation is, should exercise its general powers of supervision
and do all it reasonably may to protect investments in the

Oct. 1878.]

bonds and stock from loss through improvident management.
No better case can be found for illustration than is presented
by the history of this corporation. Without undertaking in
any manner to cast censure upon those by whose matchless
energy this great road was built and, as if by magic, put into
operation, it is a fact which cannot be deniedi that, when the
road was in a condition to be run, its bonds and stocks represented vastly more than the actual cost of the labor and material which went into its construction. Great undertakings
like this, whose future is it the time uncertain, requiring as
they do large amounts of money to carry them on, seem to
mqke it necessary that extraordinary inducements should be
held out to capitalists to enter upon them, since a failure is
almost sure to involve those who make the venture in financial
ruin. It is not, however, the past with which we are now to
deal, but rather the present and the future. We are not sitting in judgment upon the history of this corporation, but upon
its present condition. We now know that when the road
was completed its funded debt alone was as follows: First mortgage, $27,232,000, subsidy bonds, $27,236,512, all maturing
thirty years after date, and that the average time of its maturity
is during the year 1897. In addition to this are now the sinking-fund bonds, the land-grant bonds,'and the Omaha-bridge
bonds, amounting to at least $20,000,000 more. The interest
on the first mortgage and all other classes, of bonds, except the
subsidy bonds, will undoubtedly be met as it falls due; but on
the subsidy bonds, as has already been seen, no interest is
payable, except out of the half of the earnings for government
service and the five per cent of net earnings, until the maturity
of the principal. Thus far, as we have had occasion to observe
in the various suits which have come before us during the past
few years, involving an inquiry into these matters, the payments from these sources have fallen very far short of keeping
down the accruing interest, and according to present appearances it is not probably too much to say that when the debt is
due there will be as much owing the United States for interest
paid as for principal. There -will then become due from this
company, in less than twenty years from this date, in the neigh-

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

borhood of *$80,000,000, secured by the first and subsidy mort:
gages. In addition to this are the capital stock, representing
$36,000,000 more, and the funded debt inferior in its lien to
that of the subsidy bonds. All these different classes of securities have become favorites in the market for investments, and
they are widely scattered at home and abroad. They have
taken to a certain extent the place of the public funds as investments. With the exception of the land-grant, which is
first devoted to the payment of the land-grant bonds, but little
if any thing except the earnings of the company can be depended
on to meet these obligations when they mature. The company
has been in the receipt of large earnings since the completion of
its road, and, after paying the interest on its own bonds'at
maturity, has been dividing the remainder, or a very considerable portion of it, from time to time among its stockholders,
without laying by any thing to meet the enormous debt which,
considering the amount, is so soon to become due. It is easy to
see that in this way the stockholders of the present time are
receiving in the shape of dividends that which those of the
future may be compelled to lose. It is hardly to be presumed
that this great weight of pecuniary obligation can be removed
without interfering with dividends hereafter, unless at once
some preparation is made by sinking-fund or otherwise to prevent it. Under these circumstances, the stockholders of to-day
have no property right to dividends which shall absorb all the
net earnings after paying debts already due. The current
earnings belong to the corporation, and the stockholders, as
such, have no right to them as against the just demands of
creditors.
The United States occupy towards this corporation a twofold relation, - that of sovereign and that of creditor. United
States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 98 U. S. 569. Their
rights as sovereign are not crippled because they are creditors,
and their privileges as creditors are not enlarged by the charter
becanse of their sovereignty. They cannot, as creditors, demand
payment of what is due them before the time limited by the
contract. Neither can they, as sovereign or creditors, require
the company to pay the other debts it owes before they mature.
But out of regard to the rights of the subsequent lienholders

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND CASES.

and stockholders, it is not only their right, but their duty, as
sovereign to see to it that the current stockholders do not, in the
administration of the affairs of the corporation, appropriate to
their own use that which in equity belongs to others. A legislative regulation which does no more than require them to submit to their just contribution towards the payment of a bonded
debt cannot in any sense be said to deprive them of their property without due process of law.
The question still remains, whether the particular provision
of this statute now under consideration comes within this rule.
It establishes a sinking-fund for the payment of debts when
they mature, but does not pay the debts. The original contracts of loan are not changed. They remain as they were
before, and are only to be met at maturity. All that has been
done is to make it the duty of the company to lay by a portion
of its current net income to meet its debts when they do fall
due. In this way the current stockholders are prevented to
some extent from depleting the treasury for their own benefit,
at the expense of those who are to come after them. This is
no more for the benefit of the creditors than it is for the corporation itself. It tends to give permanency to the value of the
stock and bonds, and is in the direct interest of a faithful administration of affairs. It simply compels the managers for the
time being to do what they ought to do voluntarily. The fund
to be created is not so much for the security of the creditors as
the ultimate protection of the public and the corporators.
To our minds it is a matter of no consequence that the Secretary of the Treasury is made the sinking-fund agent and the
treasury of the United States the depository, or that the investment is to be made in the public funds of the United States.
This does not make the deposit a payment of the debt due the
United States. The duty of the manager of every sinking-fund
is to seek some safe investment for the moneys as they accumulate in his hands, so that when required they may be promptly
available. Certainly no objection can be made to the security
of this investment. In fact, we do not understand that complaint is made in this particular. The objection is to the creation of the fund and not to the investment, if that investment
is not in law a payment.

SINKiNG-FUND CASES.

[SUP? Gt.

Neither is it a fatal objection that the half of the earnings
for services rendered the government, which by the act of 1864
was to be paid to the companies, is put into this fund. The
government is not released from the payment. While the
money is retained, it is only that it may be put into the fund,
which, although kept in the treasury, is owned by the company.
When the debts are paid, the securities into which the moneys
have been converted that remain undisposed of must be handed
over to the corporation. Under the circumstances, the retaining of the money in the treasury as part of the sinking-fund is
in law a payment to the company.
Not to pursue this branch of the inquiry any further, it is
sufficient now to say that we think the legislation complained
of may be sustained on the ground that it is a reasonable regulation of the administration of the affairs of the corporation,
and promotive of the interests of the public and the corporators. It takes nothing from the corporation or the stockholders
which actually belongs to them. It oppresses no one, and inflicts no wrong. It simply gives further assurance of the continued solvency and prosperity of a corporation in which the
public are so largely interested, and adds another guaranty to
the permanent and lasting value of its vast amount of securities.
The legislation is also warranted under the authority by way
of amendment to change or modify the rights, privileges, and
immunities granted by the charter. The right of the stockholders to a division of the earnings of the corporation is a
privilege derived from the charter. When the charter and its
amendments first became laws, and the work on the road was
undertaken, it was by no means sure that the enterprise would
prove a financial success. No statutory restraint was then put
upon the power of declaring dividends. It was not certain that
the stock would ever find a place on the list of marketable
seckirities, or that there would be any bonds subsequent in lien
to that of the United States which could need legislative or
otiher protection. Hence, all this was left unprovided for in
the charter and its amendments as originally granted, and the
reservation of the power of amendment inserted so as to enable
the government to accommodate its legislation to the require-

ments of the public and the corporation as they should be developed in the future. Now it is known that the stock of the
company has found its way to the markets of the world; that
large issues of bonds have been made beyond what was originally contemplated, and that the company has gone on for
years dividing its earnings without any regard to its increasing
debt, or to the protection of those whose rights may be endan.
gered if this practice is permitted to continue. For this reason
Congress has interfered, and, under its reserved power, limited
the privilege of declaring dividends on current earnings, so as
to confine the stockholders .to what is left after suitable provision has been made for the protection of creditors and stockholders against the disastrous consequences of a constantly
increasing debt. As this increase cannot be kept down by
payment unless voluntarily made by the corporation, the next
best thing has been done, that is to say, a fund safely invested,
which increases as the debt increases, has been established and
set apart to meet the debt when the time comes that payment
can be required.
The only material difference between the Central Pacific
Company and the Union Pacific lies in the fact that in the
case of the Central Pacific the special franchises, as well as
the land and subsidy bonds, were granted by the United
States to a corporation formed and organized under the laws
of California, while in that of the Union Pacific Congress
created the corporation to which the grants were made. The
California corporation was organized under a State law with
an authorized capital of $8,500,000, to build a road from the
city of Sacramento to the eastern boundary of the State, a
distance of about one hundred and fifteen miles. Under the
operation of its California charter, it. could only borrow money
to an amount not exceeding the capital stock, and must pro.
vide a sinking-fund for the ultimate redemption of the bonds.
Hittell's Cal. Laws, 1850-64, sect. 840. No power was granted
to build any road outside the State, or in the State except
between the termini named. By the act of 1862, Congress
granted this corporation the right to build a road from San
Francisco, or the navigable waters of the Sacramento River,
to the eastern boundary of the State, and from there through

corporation voluntarily submitted itself to such legislative control by Congress as was reserved under the power of amendment.
No objection has ever been made by the State to this action
by Congress. On the contrary, the State, by implication at
least, has given its assent to what was done, for in 1864 it
passed "An Act to aid in carrying out the provisions of the
Pacific railroad and telegraph act of Congress," and thereby
confirmed and vested in the company "all the rights, privileges,
franchises, power, and authority conferred upon, granted to, or
-vested in said company by said act of Congress," and repealed
"all laws or parts of laws inconsistent or in conflict with . . .
the rights and privileges herein (therein) granted." Hittell's
Laws, sect. 4798; Acts of 1863-64, 471. Inasmuch as by the
Constitution of California then in force (art. 4, sect. 31) corporations, except for municipal purposes, could not be created
by special act, but must be formed under general laws, the
legal effect of this act is probably little more than a legislative
recognition by the State of what had been done by the United
States with one of the State corporations.
In so doing, the State but carried out its original policy in
reference to the same subject-matter, for as early as May 1,
1852, an act was passed reciting " that the interests of this
State, as well as those of the whole Union, require the immediate action of the government of the United States, for the
construction of a national thoroughfare connecting the naviga-

ble waters of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, for the purposes
of national safety, in the event of war, and to promote the
highest commercial interests of the Republic," and granting
the right of way through the State to the United States for
the purpose of constructing such a road. Hittell's Laws, sect.
4791; Acts of 1852, 150. In 1859 (Acts of 1859, 391), a resolution was passed calling a convention "to consider the refusal
of Congress to take efficient measures for the construction of a
railroad from the Atlantic States to the Pacific, and to adopt
measures whereby the building of said railroad can be accomplished;" and at the same session of the legislature a memorial
was prepared asking Congress to pass a law authorizing the
construction of such a road, and asking also a grant of lands to
aid in the construction of railroads in the State. Acts of 1859,
395. Nothing was done, however, by Congress until the Rebellion, which at once called the attention of all who were
interested in the preservation of the Union to the immense
practical importance of such a road for military purposes, and
then, as soon as a plan could be matured and the necessary
forms of legislation gone through with, the act of July 1, 1862,
was passed. But this was not enough to interest capitalists in
the undertaking, and although the legislature of California
during the year.1863 passed several acts intended to hold out
further inducements, but little was accomplished until the
amendatory act of Congress in 1864, which, besides authorizing the first mortgage, and changing in some important particulars the conditions on which the subsidy bonds were to be
issued, conferred additional powers on the corporation, some of
which, such as the right of eminent domain in the Territories,
the State could not grant, and others, such as the right of issuing first-mortgage bonds without a sinking-fund, and in excess
of the capital stock, it had seen fit to withhold. This act also
reserved to Congress full power of amendment, and was promptly
accepted by the corporation. With this addition of corporate
powers and pecuniary resources the work was pushed forward
to completion with unexampled energy. But for the corporate
powers and financial aid granted by Congress it is not probable
that the road would have been built. The first-mortgage
bonded debt was created without a sinking-fund, and the road

in the Territories built under the authority of Congress, assented
to and ratified by the State.
The Western Pacific Company, now, by consolidation, a part
of the Central Pacific Company, was also organized, Dec. 13,
1862 (Acts of 1863, 81), under the general railroad law of
California, with power to construct a road from a point on the
San Francisco and San Jos6 Raihoad, at or near San Jos6, to
Sacramento, and there connect with the road of the Central
Pacific Company. Afterwards the Central Pacific Company
assigned to this corporation its rights, under the act of Congress,
to construct the road between San Jos6 and Sacramento; and
this assignment was ratified by Congress, "with all the privileges and benefits of the several acts of Congress relating
thereto, and subject to all the conditions thereof." 13 Stat.
504. By the same act further privileges were granted by
the United States both to the Central Pacific and Western
Pacific Companies, in respect to their issue of first-mortgage
bonds.
Under this legislation, we are of the opinion that, to the
extent of the powers, rights, privileges, and immunities granted
these corporations by the United States, Congress retains the
right of amendment, and that in this way it may regulate the
administration of the affairs of the company in reference to
the debts created under its own authority, in a manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of the original State charter,
as modified by the State Aid Act of 1864, accepting what had
been done by Congress. This is as far as it is necessary to go
now. It will be time enough to consider what more may be
done when the necessity arises. As yet, the State has not attempted to interfere with the action of Congress. All complaint
thus far has come from the corporation itself, which, to secure
the government aid, accepted all the conditions that were attached to the grants, including the reservation of'power to
amend.
It is clear that the establishment of a sinking-fund by the
act of 1878 is not at all in conflict with any thing contained in
the original State charter, for by that charter no such debt
could be created without provision for such a fund. This part
of the act of 1878 is, therefore, in the exact line of the policy

of the State, and does 'no more than place the company again,
to some extent, under obligations from which ithad been released by congressional legislation. So, too, the reservation of
the power of amendment by Congress is equally consistent with
the settled policy of the State; for not only the State charter,
in terms, makes such a reservation in favor of the State, but
the Constitution expressly provides that all laws for the creation
of corporations "may be altered from time to time, or repealed."
Art. 4, sect. 31.
It is not necessary now to inquire whether, in ascertaining
the net earnings of the company for the purpose of fixing the
amount of the annual contributions to the sinking-fund, the
earnings of all the roads owned by the present corporation are
to be taken into the account, or only of those in aid of which
the land-grants were made and the subsidy bonds issued. The
question here is only as to the power of Congress to establish
the fund at all. If disputes should ever arise as to the manner of stating the accounts, they can be settled at some future
time.

MR. JUSTICE STRONG. In my opinion, the act of Congress
of May 7, 1878, is plainly transgressive of legislative power.
As was said by Mr. Hamilton in his celebrated communication
to the Senate of Jan. 20, 1795, "when a government enters
into a contract with an individual, it deposes, as to the matter
of the contract,'its constitutional authority, and exchanges the
character of legislator for that of a moral agent, with the same
rights and obligations as an individual. Its promises may be
justly considered as excepted out of its power to legislate'
unless in aid of them. It is in theory impossible to reconcile
the idea of a promise which obliges, with a power to make a
law which can vary the effect of it." 3 Hamilton's Works,
518, 519. Opinions similar to this have often found expression in judicial decisions, even in those of this court. If this

SINKING-FUND

[Sup. Ct

be sound doctrine, it is as much beyond the power of a legislature, under any pretence, to alter a contract into which the
government has entered with a private individual, as it is for
any other party to a contract to change its terms without the
consent of the person contracting with him. As to its contract the government in all its departments has laid aside its
sovereignty, and it stands on the same footing with private
con tractors.
The contracts of the government with the Union Pacific
Railroad Company and with the Central Pacific, which the
act of Congress of 1878 has in view, were not made by the act
of 1862, the act chartering the former company, nor by the
amending act of 1864. They were made after those acts
had been accepted by the companies, and after their chartered
rights had been completely acquired. There was no agreement of the companies to repay the loan of government bonds
made to them, until the bonds were issued and delivered. The
companies were under no obligation to accept the loan and
assume the liability resulting from its acceptance. The contracts, therefore, are no part of the charter of the Union Pacific Company, and no part of the acts of 1862 or 1864. They
are subsequent to those acts and independent of them. It is
true Congress authorized the loan. It made the companies
offers to lend upon certain conditions; and when those offerp
and conditions were subsequently accepted, the contracts of
loan were made. Not until then. Before that time there was
nothing but an unaccepted offer.
What, then, was the contract when it was made? The
government lent its bonds, and, in consideration of the loan,
each company assumed five obligations: 1st, to pay the bonds
at their maturity, that is, at the expiration of thirty years ;
2d, to keep the railroad and telegraph line in repair and use;
3d, to furnish transmission of despatches and transportation
for the government at reasonable rates, allowing it a preference
for such purposes ; 4th, to apply to the payment of the bonds
and interest half the compensation due to it from the government for services rendered, until the whole amount of the loan
is fully paid; and, 5th, after the completion of the railroad, to
apply to the payment of the bonds at least five per cent annu-

ally of its net earnings. The lender required and the borrower
undertook nothing more.
It is manifest that by this contract the government acquired
a vested right to payment at the time and in the mode specified, as well as to preference of transportation and transmission
of despatches; and the company acquired a vested right to
retain the consideration given for its assumption, - that is, a
vested right to withhold payment until by the terms of the
contract payment became due. The contract implied an agreement not to call for payment or additional security before that
time. I cannot conceive of any rational doubt of this. There
is no technicality about vested rights. Most of them grow out
of contracts, and, no matter how they arise, they are all equally
sacred, equally beyond the reach of legislative interference.
A vested right of action is property in the same sense in which
rights to tangible things are, and is equally protected. Whether
it springs from contract or from other rules of the common
law, it is not competent for the legislature to take it away. If
we look at what must have been the understanding of all parties to these contracts of loan, the rights created and vested
under them cannot be in doubt. The government sought to
induce private adventurers to construct a railroad and telegraph
line to the Pacific Ocean, - a work which necessarily required
.years and immense expenditures for its accomplishment. A
loan, repayable on call or within a short time, would have been
no inducement. Had it been dreamed that a call could have
been made at any time thereafter designated by Congress, it is
inconceivable that the loan proffered would have been accepted.
It would have furnished no reliable basis for an attempt to
build the road. The parties could not so have understood the
bargain. The bonds were required to be paid by the companies only at their maturity, except so far as half-payment
for governmental service, and five per cent of the net earnings,
after the completion of the road, might pay. The contract,
therefore, means exactly wbat it would have meant had it contained the express stipulation: "The United States shall not
require payment of the amount of the bonds, or any part
thereof (except half-compensation for services, and five per
cent of net earnings), until the expiration of thirty years from

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Slip. CIL

their issue to the company, or date, nor shall additional security be required, beyond the lien reserved." Such was the
contract. It was not one of the franchises granted in the
charter of the Union Pacific or the Central Pacific, but it was
a business transaction, differing in nothing, except parties,
from what it would have been if it had been made between
two private individuals. It is true Congress authorized the
loan on the terms upon which it was made; but, as I have
said, the contract was not made by the act of Congress, or
with Congress. It was a subsequent transaction, and the
United States became a party to it, not in its sovereign character, but as a civil corporation, as said by Mr. Hamilton,
with the same rights and obligations as a private person, and
no more.
Now, what has been attempted by the act of May 7, 1878?
That act was passed with sole reference to this contract, and
all its provisions have in view the imposition of additional
obligations upon the railroad company. It does not purport to
be a repeal of the charter. Its leading purpose is to take control of the property of the debtor, and sequester it for the security of a debt, which, by the terms of the contract, is not due
and payable for years to come. I shall not go over all its provisions. It will be sufficient to notice some of the more prominent ones, which, if they are ruled to be operative, greatly
change the contract which the parties made when the bonds
were delivered and accepted, when the contract was closed,
and which impose new and oppressive obligations upon the
debtor.
By the contract only one-half the compensation for services
rendered to the government was required to be applied to the
payment of the bonds, but by this act the whole amount of the
compensation which may from time to time be due for services
rendered to the government is directed to be retained by the
United States, and, at the same time, the obligation to render
those services is continued. By the third, section of the act a
sinking-fund is established in the treasury of the United States,
that is, in the treasury of the creditor; and the fourth section
enacts that there shall be carried into that fund, on the first day
of February in each year,the one-half of the compensation above

Ot. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND OASES.

named, not applied in liquidation of interest. By the contract
the debtor was bound to pay only five per cent of its net earnings, after the completion of the road, annually to the creditor;
but this act requires thd debtor to pay into the creditor's treassury, to the credit of the sinking-fund, twenty-five per cent of
its whole net earnings, on the 1st of February in each year.
The act further directs that the sinking-fund thus created
shall, with its accumulations, be invested in bonds of the
United States, and at the maturity of the bonds loaned to the
debtor be applied to the payment and satisfaction thereof,
and of all interest paid by the United States. There are other
provisions of this act intended to enforce compliance with
these newly added obligations imposed upon the debtor, as also
provisions that the sinking-fund shall be held for the benefit,
protection, and security of other lien-creditors of the debtor.
But I deem it unnecessary to mention them in detail. Those
which I have mentioned are enough for the present case. No one
can deny that they materially change the contract of loan and
borrowing previously existing between the government and the
railroad companies, and change it at the will of the creditor
alone. Nor can it be denied that they impose upon the debtors
new and onerous burdens that they never agreed to assume.
Practically, they enforce payment of the debt before, by the
terms of the contract, it is due. The act seizes the half-compensation, which the government agreed should not be retained,
and covers it into the treasury, appropriating it to the payment
of the debt. For nothing else can it be used. The act also
requires payment into the treasury of twenty-five per cent of
the net earnings of the company, instead of five per cent only,
as stipulated when the contract was made. It is true it does
not make immediate application of the sums thus withheld and
demanded to the extinguishment of the debt. It declares that
they shall be applied to the payment of the debt and interest
"at the maturity of the bonds." But this is a distinction
without a difference, obviously made to evade what it was
known could not lawfully be done. An immediate application
might as well have been directed. It would probably be better
for the debtor if the application were immediately made. The
money is taken from the debtor, withdrawn entirely from the

[Sup. Ct.

debtor's control and use, and put into the treasury of the creditor, and there left to the mere agreement of the creditor to
apply it to payment. I apprehend no plain man of common
sense will hesitate to conclude that this is exacting payment
before the debt is due. If A. borrows from B. $1,000, and gives
his note therefor, payable at the expiration of five years, and
at the end of one year the lender demands that there be placed
in his hands by the debtor a sum of money to meet the note
when it shall fall due, it will hardly be contended that would
not be requiring payment before the debtor was bound to pay.
And if such a demand could be enforced, it would be at the
expense of the contract. What more is the present case ?
And were it conceded the act of 1878 does not attempt to
enforce the payment before the maturity of the debt, the concession would be of little worth, for it will not be questioned
that it attempts to enforce giving additional security for payment beyond that stipulated for in the contract. That is no
less a material alteration of the contract, a serious addition to
it. The plain truth is, the assertion of such a power is claiming the right to disregard the contract entirely, and substitute
for it a different one, without the consent of the debtor. If the
United States -can exact now one-quarter of the net earnings of
each of these companies, and place it in their treasury, they
can, by the same power, and with the same reason, exact the
whole of the earnings, or any other property equal to the
amount of the debt. Was any such thing contemplated by
the parties when the contract was made?
Now, where is the power of Congress to add new terms to
any contract made with the United States, or made between
any two private individuals? Where is the power to annul
vested rights ? It is certainly not to be found in the Constitution. True, the provision that no State shall pass any law
impairing the obligation of contracts applies only to State legislation. For such legislation the prohibition was necessary; for
State legislatures have all legislative power which is not expressly denied to them. But no necessity existed for imposing
such a limitation on the power of Congress. As Mr. Hamilton
said in the eighty-fourth number of the Federalist, "Why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to

SINKING-FUND CASES.

do?" Congress has no power except such as has been expressly
granted to it, or such as is necessary or proper for carrying
into execution the powers specified, and those vested by the
Constitution in the government, or some department or odfficer
thereof. I search in vain for any express or implied grant of
power to add new terms to any existing contracts made by or
with the government, or any grant of power to destroy vested
rights. No power has been given to Congress to lessen the
obligations of a contract between private parties by direct
legislation, except by the enactment of uniform laws on the
subject of bankruptcy. Even a bankrupt law cannot be enacted applicable only to single corporations or single debtors.
To be constitutional, it must be uniform throughout the United
States. I admit that in the exercise of some of the powers
granted, Congress may enact laws that indirectly affect existing contracts and lessen their obligation, but I deny that it
can by any direct action, otherwise than by a bankrupt law,
even relieve a debtor to a private party from any duty he has
assumed by his contract. Much less can it change the stipulations of the contract and impose additional liabilities upon
a contractor with the government. Such an exercise of power
would be making a contract for parties to which they never
assented. In all the history of congressional legislation before
the act of 1878, such a power was never attempted to be
exercised.
And not only is such legislative authority not conferred
upon Congress by the Constitution, but it is, in effect, expressly
denied. The fifth amendment contains restrictions taken, in
substance, from Magna Charta. Among them are the' provisions that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken
for public use without just compensation. These are restrictions upon legislative as well as executive power. What is
due process of law is well understood. It is law in regular
course of administration through courts of justice. Coke, 2
Inst. 272; Murray's Lessee v. The Hoboken Land and Improvenent Co., 18 How. 272. "The terms ' the law of the land,' said
Chief Justice Ruffin (Hoke v. Harderson,4 Dev. (N. C.) 1),
do not mean merely an act of the General Assembly. If they

did, every restriction upon legislative authority would be at
once abrogated, and private property would be at the mercy
of the legislature." p. 15. Yet the act of 1878 does attempt
by its own force, and without any judicial action, not only
to change a contract and increase its obligations, but also to
deprive the railroad companies of their property. What is
property? What is the common understanding of the term?
It is, in reference to its subject, whatever a person can possess
and enjoy by right, and the person who has that right has the
property. The subject may be corporeal or incorporeal. A
right in action is as completely property as is a title to land.
A very large portion of the property of the country consists in
rights attendant upon contract. The right of a promisee to
demand payment when the note falls due is a right of property;
and equally so is the right of the promisor to hold, as against
his promisee, the consideration for the promise until the time
stipulated in the note for payment. The promisee has no right
to enforce payment, or to enforce giving security for it, if none
was promised in the contract. Such a right is no portion of
his property, and it can be enforced only at the expense of a
clear right of the promisor. On the other hand, the promisor
has a right to exemption from liability to give such security.
It is incident to his contract. Indeed, it may be said that
whatever rights are created by contract, or held under it, if
they relate to property, are themselves, in a very just sense,
property, and as such are protected by the fifth amendment to
the Constitution.
I notice another consideration which, to my mind, is not
without weight. It may, I think, well be doubted whether
the act of 1878 is even an attempted exercise of legislative
power. A statute undertaking to take the property of A. and
transfer it to B. is not legislation. It would not be a law. It
would be a decree or sentence, the right to declare which, if it
exists at all, is in the Judicial Department of the government.
The act of Congress is little, if any, more. It does not purport to be a general law. It does not apply to all corporations
or to all debtors of the government. It singles out two corporations, debtors of the government, by name, and prescribes
for them as debtors new duties to their creditor. It thus at-

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND CASES.

tempts to perform the functions of a court. This, I cannot but
think, is outside of legislative action and power.
I turn now to the arguments by which the constitutionality
of the act of Congress has been attempted to be supported. It
is said that, though Congress cannot directly abrogate contracts, or impair their obligation, it may indirectly, by the
exercise of other powers granted to it. This I have conceded,
but I deny that an acknowledged power can be exerted solely
for the purpose of effecting indirectly an unconstitutional end
which the legislature cannot directly attempt to reach. If the
purpose were declared in the act, I think no court would hesitate to pronounce the act void. In Hoke v. farderson,to which
I have referred, Chief Justice Ruffin, when considering at
length an argument that a legislature could purposely do indirectly what it could not do directly, used this strong language: "The argument is unsound in this, that it supposes
(what cannot be admitted as a suppositiofi) the legislature
will, designedly and wilfully, violate the Constitution, in utter
disregard of their oaths and duty. To do indirectly in the
abused exercise of an acknowledged power, not given for, but
perverted for that purpose, that which is expressly forbidden
to be done directly, is a gross and wicked infraction of the
Constitution."
It is unnecessary, however, to enlarge upon this, for the
effect wrought upon the contracts of these two companies is a
direct effect, - a direct alteration of the obligation assumed by
the debtors, and not an incidental result of legislation upon some
other subject over which Congress has a right to legislate. It
is too plain to admit of any doubt that the sole object of the
act of 1878 was to enforce giving new and additional security
for the payment of the subsidy bonds at their maturity. All
its provisions aim directly at that, and the new terms thereby
added to the contract have that end solely in view.
In further attempted support of the validity of the act, it
has been denied that it does change the contract, because it
does not require the application of the additional payments to
the satisfaction of the debt before its maturity. I have, perhaps, said enough upon this subject. The argument can hardly
be seriously made. The act does compel the debtors to surren-

SINKING-FUND OASES.

[Sup. Ct.

der possession of their property to the creditor before the time
when, by the terms of the contract, they were under obligation to part with it. The debtors are no longer permitted to
hold and use one-half the compensation due presently from the
governmept for services rendered, and are no longer at liberty
to use all their net income or earnings, except five per cent, at
their discretion. One quarter of their net earnings they are
compelled to surrender to the creditor. Thus the creditor becomes the custodian of the debtors' property, and acquires a
right to hold and manage it as if it were his own. It is absurd
to say this is not practically a radical change in the relations
between the parties established by the contract. And. it is
equally impossible to maintain that it is not depriving the
debtors of their property without due process of law.
I turn now to what has been most relied upon in support
of the validity of the act. I refer to the clauses in the acts of
1862 and 1864, reserving the right to repeal, amend, or alter.
There are two such, - one in the act of 1862, and one in that
of 1864. That in the latter act is the broadest, and it is as
follows: "Congress may at any time alter, amend, or repeal
this act." The power thus reserved is one over the act itself,
not over any thing that may have lawfully been done under the
act, before its repeal or alteration. It is only by great confusion of things essentially distinct that this power can be construed as applicable to a contract made after the corporation
came into existence. Besides, the act of 1878 does not attempt
to repeal, or alter or amend, the acts of 1862 and 1864. It
changes no franchise granted by those acts, nor does it interfere
-with its exercise. It interferes only with the fruits of the franchise. The right to possess and enjoy the income of the company is not a franchise. It is an incident of the ownership of
the company's property, though the property may be accumuhated by the use of the franchise. Concede that Congress has
power to regulate the tolls on the railroad, or in some other
mode to restrict the use of the franchise, and thus lessen the
income, yet the income, whether large or small when made,
is the company's property, and, like other property, protected
against being taken without due process of law. Or suppose
the acts of 1862 and 1864 were repealed, and thus all the fran-

CASES.

chises granted by them were taken away, the property of the
company would remain, and the income thereof, though .greatly
decreased, would be the property of the stockholders. Nobody
denies that. Is the lesser greater than the whole ? I repeat,
therefore, the act of 1878 is no exercise of the reserved power
to alter, amend, or repeal the acts of 1862 and 1864. It is no
attempt to make any such repeal or amendment. It is at most
an attempt to seize the fruits of the franchise after they shall
have become the vested property of the corporations. It is
an attempt to sequester the income of the property owned by
them. As well might the government attempt to seize and
put into its treasury the rents, issues, and profits of the lands
granted to them by the third and fourth sections of the act of
1862, and call that an amendment of the act. There is no
distinction to be made between the profits of the road and
telegraph line and the rents of the lands. None has been attempted.
But if the act of 1878 could be considered an alteration or
amendment of the acts of 1862 and 1864, the question would
still remain, what was the extent of the power reserved by
those acts. I mean the power to alter, amend, or repeal them.
All the cases agree that such a reserved power is not without
limits. I think its limits may be stated generally thus: It
must be exercised, when exerted at all, so as to do no injustice
to those to whom the franchise has been granted. Certainly
the reservation cannot mean a right to take away the franchise,
in whole or in part, and yet hold the grantee to the performance of the duties assumed, - the consideration given for the
grant. Nor can it mean to continue in the legislative power
which the legislature never possessed, and which it is constitutionally incapable of exercising. A partial definition of the
limits of the reserved power may be found in Commonwealth
v. Essex Company (13 Gray (Mass.), 239), where Chief Justice
Shaw (speaking of the reserved power to alter, amend, or repeal
a charter), said: "It seems to us this power must have some
limit, though it is difficult to define it. Suppose authority has
been given by law to a railroad corporation to purchase a lot
of land and hold it for purposes connected with its business,
and they. purchase such lot from a third person, could the legis-

[Sup. Ct.

lature prohibit the company from holding it? If so, in whom
would it vest? Or could the legislature direct it to revert to
the grantor or escheat to the public? Or how otherwise?
Suppose a manufacturing company, incorporated, is authorized
to construct a dam and flow a tract of meadow, and the owners
claim gross damages, which are assessed and paid, can the legislature afterwards alter the act of incorporation so as to give to
such meadow owners future annual damages? Perhaps from
these extreme cases, for extreme cases are allowable to test a
legal principle, the rule to be extracted is this: that where,
under a power in a charter, rights have been acquired and become vested, no amendment or alteration of the charter can
take away the property or rights which have become vested
under a legitimate exercise of the powers granted." p. 253.
This rule has been recognized ever since. Vide Sage v. Dillard,
15 B. Mlon. (Ky.) 349. It has been adopted by this court. In
Miller v. Te State (15 Wall. 478), it was said by Mr. Justice
Clifford: "Power to legislate founded upon such a reservation
in a charter of a private corporation is certainly not without
limits, and it may well be admitted that it cannot be exercised
to take away or destroy rights acquired by such a charter, and
which, by a legitimate use of the powers granted, have become
vested in the corporation." To the same effect is Holyoke Compani v. Lyman, id. 500. If this limitation be admitted, it is
impossible to see how a reserved power to alter, amend, or
repeal an act granting a private charter can include a right to
change the stipulations of a contract made under that charter,
or to sequester for any purpose the property of the company
acquired while the charter remains unrepealed and unaltered.
If the acts of 1862 and 1864 were repealed, would not the contract of loan remain unaffected thereby ? Can a legislature
that offers a contract on certain terms change those terms after
they have been accepted and after the contract has been perfected ? Yet that is what the act of 1878 attempts to do. A
principal who has authorized his agent to make a contract for
him may revoke or restrict the agency before any contract is
made, but he is bound by a contract made during the continuance of the agent's powers, if those powers were not transgressed in making it. He cannot afterwards repudiate its

SINKING-FUND CASES.

terms or add to them. I see no essential difference between
such a case and the present. I cannot confound an alteration
of the acts of 1862 and 1864 with an alteration of a subsequent
commercial contract authorized by those acts, and made between the United States and companies chartered by them.
My conviction, therefore, is, that the act of 1878 cannot be
defended as a legitimate exercise of the powers reserved to
Congress.
I need not say it cannot rest upon what is generally denominated the visitatorial power of the government over its own
corporations, though it is upon this power the opinion of the
majority of the court largely relies. That power is applicable
only to eleemosynary corporations, such as colleges, schools, and
hospitals, and the visitation is always through the medium of
courts of justice. It is judicial and not legislative. 2 Kent,
Com., Lect. 23, sect. 4. To claim, therefore, that, by virtue
of that power, a private business corporation can be compelled
by legislative action to establish a sinking-fund for the payment
of its debts, and deposit it in the treasury -of its creditor, is
totally inadmissible.
There are, undoubtedly, many cases to be found in which it
has been decided that, by virtue of such a reservation as that
contained in the acts of 1862 and 1864, a legislature may make
new regulations, to some extent, of the action of corporations
created by it, -such
as prescribing a new measure of tolls,
increasing the capital of insurance companies, repealing an exemption from taxation, and the like. So, without the reservations, some new regulations may be prescribed in the exercise of
the police power. They are all regulations of the franchise or
of its use,- not invasions of rights or property acquired under
the franchise subsequently to its grant; and not one of them
under the practice of amendment or rightful regulation has
undertaken to change or vary any contract the corporation bad
made, or to control possession of property acquired. The act
of 1878 is, I believe, the first assertion of any such force in the
reservation. It is a very grave and dangerous assertion. It
is especially dangerous in these days of attempted repudiation,
when the good faith of the government is above all price. If
it can be maintained, the government is no longer bound by

SINKING-FUND

OASES.

[Sup. Ct.

any commercial contract into which it may enter with these
corporations, though it holds them bound. I cannot assent to
any such doctrine; and upon the whole, in my opinion, the
act of 1878 is not only unauthorized by any power existing
in Congress, but it is an infraction of the prohibition I have
pointed out, contained in the fifth amendment of the Constitution.
Most of what I have said is applicable to each of the cases,
-that of the Union Pacific and that of the Central. There
are some other considerations peculiar in the case of the Central Pacific, which is a corporation of the State of California,
and was such in 1862. These I leave for consideration by my
brethren who unite with me in dissent.
MIR. JUSTIcE BRADLEY. I am unable to concur in the judgment of the court in these cases, and will very briefly state the
grounds of my dissent.
I think that Congress had no power to pass the act of May
7, 1878, either as it regards the Union Pacific or the Central
Pacific Railroad Company. The power of Congress, even over
those subjects upon which it has the right to legislate, is not
despotic, but is subject to certain constitutional limitations.
One of these is, that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; another is, that
private property shall not be taken for public use without just
compensation; and a third is, that the judicial power of the
United States is vested in the supreme and inferior courts, and
not in Congress. It seems to me that the law in question is
violative of all these restrictions,- of their spirit at least, if
not of their letter; and a law which violates the spirit of the
Constitution is as much unconstitutional as one that violates
its letter. For example, although the Constitution declares only
that private property shall not be taken for public use without
just compensation, and does not expressly declare that it shall
not be taken for private use without compensation, or, in other
words, does not declare that the property of one person shall
not be taken from him and given to another without compensation, yet no one can reasonably doubt that a law which should
do this would be unconstitutional, because the prohibition to do

it is'within the spirit of the prohibition that is given, it being
the greater enormity of the two.
The contract between the Union and Central Pacific Railroad Companies and the government was an executed contract,
and a definite one. It was in efiect this: that the government
should loan the companies certain moneys, and that the companies should have a certain period of time to repay the amount,
the loan resting on the security of the companies' works. Congress, by the law in question, without any change of circumstances, and against the protest of the companies, declares that
the money shall be paid at an earlier day, and that the contract
shall be changed pro tanto. This is the substance and effect
of the law. Calling the money paid a sinking-fund makes no
substantial difference. The pretence or excuse for the law is
that the stipulated security is not good. Congress takes up
the question, ex parte, discusses and decides it, passes judgment,
and proposes to issue execution, and to subject the companies
to heavy penalties if they do not comply. That is the plain
English of the law. In view of the limitations referred to, has
Congress the power to do this? In my judgment it has not.
The law virtually deprives the companies of their property without due process of law; takes it for public use without compensation; and operates as an exercise by Congress of the judicial
power of the government.
That it is a plain and flat violation of the contract there can
be no reasonable doubt. But it is said that Congress is not
subject to any inhibition against passing laws impairing the
validity of contracts. This is "true; and the reason why the inhibition to that effect was imposed upon the States and not
upon Congress evidently was, that the power to pass bankrupt
laws should be exclusively vested in Congress, in order that the
bankruptcy system might be uniform throughout the United
States. When the States exercised the power, they often did
it in such a manner as to favor their own citizens at the expense of the citizens of other States and of foreign countries.
It was deemed expedient, therefore, to take the power from
the States so far as it might involve the impairing the validity
of contracts. State bankrupt laws, since the Constitution went
into effect, have only been sustained when operating prospec-

SINKING-FUND

CASES.

[Su'p. Ct.

tively upon contracts, and then only in the absence of a national
law. The inhibition referred to undoubtedly had its origin in
these considerations. It fully explains the fact that no such
inhibition was laid upon the national legislature; and the absence of such an inhibition, therefore, furnishes no ground of
argument in favor of the proposition that Congress may pass
arbitrary and despotic laws with regard to contracts any more
than with regard to any other subject-matter of legislation.
The limitations already quoted exist in their full force, and
apply to that subject as well as to all others. They embody
the essential principles of Magna Charta, and are especially
binding upon the legislative department of the government.
Under the English Constitution, notwithstanding the theoretical omnipotence of Parliament, such a law as the one in
question would not be tolerated for a moment. The famous
denunciation that "it would cut every Englishman to the bone,"
would be promptly reiterated.
It will not do to say that the violation of the contract by
the law in question is not a taking of property. In the first
place, it is literally a taking of property. It compels the companies to pay over to the government, or its agents, money to
which the government is not entitled. That it will be entitled
by the contract to a like amount at some future time does not
matter. Time is a part of the contract. To coerce a delivery
of the money is to coerce without right a delivery of that which
is not the property of the government, but the property of the
companies. It is needless to refer to the importance to the companies of the time which the contract gives. If it be alleged
that the security of the government requires this to be done
in consequence of waste or dissipation by the companies of the
mortgage security, that is a question to be decided by judicial
investigation with opportunity of defence. A prejudgment of
the question by the Legislative Department is a usurpation
of the judicial power.
But if it were not, as it is, an actual or physical taking of
property, - if it were merely the subversion of the contract
and the substitution of another contract in its place, it would
be a taking of property within the spirit of the constitutional
provisions. A contract is property. To destroy it wholly or

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND OASES.

to destroy it partially is to take it; and to do this by arbitrary
legislative action is to do it without due process of law.
The case bears no analogy to the laws which were passed in
time of war and public necessity, making treasury notes of the
government a legal tender. The power to pass those laws was
found in other parts of the Constitution: in the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, to regulate the
value of money, to raise and support armies, to suppress insurrections, and to pass all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the general powers of the government. "My
views on that subject were fully expressed in the Legal-Tender
Cases, reported in 11 Wallace, and I have yet seen no reason
to modify them. The legal-tender laws may have indirectly
affected contracts, but did not abrogate them. The case before
us is totally different. It is a direct abrogation of a contract,
and that, too, of a contract of the government itself, -a repudiation of its own contract.
Nor does tihe case in hand bear any analogy to what are
familiarly known as the Granger Cases, reported in 94 U. S.
under the names of Munn v. Illinois, &c. The inquiry there
was as to the extent of the police power in cases where the
public interest is affected; and we held that when an employment or business becomes a matter of such public interest and
importance as to create a common charge or burden upon the
citizen; in other words, when it becomes a practical monopoly,
to which the citizen is compelled to resort, and by means of
which a tribute can be exacted from the community, it is
subject to regulation by the legislative power. It is obvious
that the present case does not belong to that category. It is
an individual case of private contract between the companies
and the government. It is a question of dollars and cents, and
terms and conditions, in a particular case. To call the law an
exercise of the police power wouldbe a misuse of terms.
Great stress, however, is laid upon the reservation in the charter of the right to amend, alter, or repeal the act.
As a matter of fact, the reservation referred to really has no
office in an act of Congress; for Congress is not subject, as the
States are, to the inhibition against passing any law impairinig
the obligation of contracts. It has become so much the custom

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

to insert it in all charters at the present day, that its original
intent and purpose are sometimes forgotten. Since, however,
it is contained in the charter of the Union Pacific Railroad
Company, it is proper that its meaning and effect should be
adverted to.
It seems to me that this clause has been greatly misunderstood. It is a sort of proviso peculiar to American legislation,
growing out of the decision in the -Dartmouth College Case. Mr.
Justice Story, in his opinion in that case (4Wheat. 675), says:
" When a private eleemosynary corporation is thus created by
the charter of the crown, it is subject to no other control on the
part of the crown than what is expressly or impliedly reserved
by the charter itself. Unless a power be reserved for this purpose, the crown cannot in virtue of its prerogative, without the
consent of the corporation, alter or amend the charter, or divest
the corporation of any of its franchises." This hint, that such
a reservation would authorize an alteration or amendment to
be made in a charter, has been freely availed of by legislatures
and constitutional conventions in order to be freed from the
constitutional restriction against impairing the validity of contracts, so far as it applied to charters of incorporation. The
application of that restriction to such charters, by construing
them to be contracts within the meaning of the Constitution,
was a surprise to many statesmen and jurists of the country.
Chief Justice Marshall, indeed, in his opinion in that case,
says: "It is more than possible that the preservation of rights
of this description was not particularly in the view of the
framers of the Constitution, when the clause under consideration was introduced into the instrument." p. 644. Probably
in view of this somewhat unexpected application of the clause,
operating as it did to deprive the States of nearly all legislative
control over corporations of their own creation, the courts have
given liberal construction to the reservation of power to alter,
amend, and repeal a charter; and have sustained some acts of
legislation made under such a reservation which are a least
questionable.
In my judgment, the reservation is to be interpreted as placing the State legislature back on the same platform of power
and control over the charter containing it as it would have

Oct. 1878.]

SINKn=G-FUND CASES.

occupied had the constitutional restriction about contracts never
existed; and I think the reservation effects nothing more. It
certainly cannot be interpreted as reserving a right to violate a
contract at will. No legislature ever reserved such a right in
any contract. Legislatures often reserve the right to terminate
a continuous contract at will; but never to violate a contract,
or change its terms without the consent of the other party.
The reserved power in question is simply that of legislation, to alter, amend, or repeal a charter. This is very different from
the power to violate, or to alter the terms of a contract at will.
A reservation of power to violate a contract, or alter it, or impair its obligation, would be repugnant to the contract itself,
and void. A proviso repugnant to the granting part of a deed,
or to the enacting part of a statute, is void. Interpreted as a
reservation of the right to legislate, the reserved power is sustainable on sound principles; but interpreted as the reservation
of a right to violate an executed contract, it is not sustainable.
The question then comes back to the extent of the power to
legislate. But that is a restricted power, - restricted by other
constitutional provisions, to which reference has already been
made. Certainly the legislature cannot in a charter of incorporation, or in any other law, reserve to itself any greater power of
legislation than the Constitution itself concedes to it. It seems
to me clear, therefore, that the power reserved cannot authorize
a flat abrogation of the contract by Congress, because, as before
shown, such an abrogation would be a violation of those clauses
which inhibit the taking of property without process of law
and without compensation.
It may be said that by reason of the reserved power to alter
and repeal a charter, this court has sustained legislative acts
imposing taxes from which the corporation by the charter was
exempted. This is true. But the imposition of taxes is preeminently an act of legislation. Its temporary suspension,
conceded in a charter, is a suspension of the legislative power
pro tanto. Being such, a reservation of the right to legislate,
or, which is the same thing, to alter, amend, or repeal the charter, necessarily includes, the right to resume the power of taxation. The same observations apply to the regulation of fares
and freights; for this is a branch of the police power, appli-

[Sup. Ct.

cable to all cases which involve a common charge upon the
people.
I conclude, therefore, that the power reserved to alter, amend,
and repeal the charter of the Union Pacific Railroad Company
is not sufficient to authorize the passage of the law in question.
I will only add, further, that the initiation of this species of
legislation by Congress is well calculated to excite alarm. It
has the effect of announcing to the world, and giving it to be
understood, that this government does not consider itself bound
by its engagements. It sets the example of repudiation of government obligations. It strikes a blow at the public credit.
It asserts the principle that might makes right. It saps the
foundations of public morality. Perhaps, however, these are
considerations more properly to be addressed to the legislative
discretion. But when forced upon the attention by what, in my
judgment, is an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power,
they have a more than ordinary weight and significance.
MNIR. JUSTICE FIELD. I also dissent from the judgment of
the court in these cases.
The decision will, in my opinion, tend to create insecurity
in the title to corporate property in the country. It, in effect,
determines that the general government, in its dealings with
the Pacific Railroad Companies, is under no legal obligation to
fulfil its contracts, and that whether it shall do so is a question
of policy and not of duty. It also seems to me to recognize
the right of the government to appropriate by legislative decree
the earnings of those companies, without judicial inquiry and
determination as to its claim to such earnings, thus sanctioning
the exercise of judicial functions in its own cases. And in respect to the Central Pacific Company it asserts a supremacy of
the Federal over the State government in the control of the corporation which, in my judgment, is subversive of the rights of
the State. I therefore am constrained to add some suggestions
to those presented by my associates, Justices Strong and Bradley. In what I have to say I shall confine myself chiefly to the
case of the Central Pacific Company. That company is a State
corporation, and is the successor of a corporation of the same
name, created before the railroad acts of Congress were passed,

Oct.1878.]

ASES.'

and of four other corporations organized under the laws of the
State. No sovereign attributes possessed by the general government were exercised in calling into existence the original
company, or any of the companies with which it is now consolidated. They all derived their powers and capacities from
the State, and held them at its will.
The relation of the general government to the Pacific companies is twofold: that of sovereign in its own territory and
that of contractor. As sovereign, its power extends to the enforcement of such acts and regulations by the companies as will
insure, in the management of their roads, and conduct of their
officers in its territory, the safety, convenience, and comfort of
the public. It can exercise such control in its territory over
all common carriers of passengers and property. As a contractor it is bound by its engagements equally with a private
individual; it cannot be relieved from them by any assertion
of its sovereign authority.
Its relation to the original Central Pacific Company, and to
the present company as its successor, in the construction and
equipment of its road, and its use for public purposes, was and
is that of a contractor; and the rights and obligations of both
are to be measured, as in the case of similar relations between
other parties, by the terms and conditions of the contract.
By the first section of the original railroad act of Congress,
passed in July, 1862, certain persons therein designated were
created a corporation by the name of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and authorized to construct and operate a continuous railroad and telegraph line from a designated point on
the one hundredth meridian of longitude west from Greenwich
to the western boundary of Nevada Territory, and were invested
with the powers, privileges, and immunities necessary for that
purpose, and with such as are usually conferred upon corporations.
By subsequent provisions of the act and the amendatory act
of 1864, three grants were made to the company thus created:
a grant of a right of way over the public lands of the United
States for the road and telegraph line; a grant of ten alternate
sections of land on each side of the road, to aid in its construction and that of the telegraph line; and a grant of a certain

SINKING-FUND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

number of subsidy bonds of the United States, each in the sum
of $1,000 payable in thirty years, with semi-annual interest,
-patents
for the lands and the bonds to be issued as each
twenty consecutive miles of the road and telegraph should be
completed. These grants were made upon certain conditions
as to the completion of the road and telegraph line, their construction and use by the government, and their pledge as security for the ultimate payment of the bonds. They were the
considerations offered by the government to the company for
the work which it undertook.
By the act which thus incorporated the Union Pacific Company, and made the grants mentioned, the United States proposed to the Central Pacific that it should construct in like
manner a railroad and a telegraph line through the State of
California from a, point near the Pacific coast to its eastern
boundary, upon the same terms and conditions, and after completing them across the State, to continue their construction
through the Territories of the United States until they should
meet and connect with the road and telegraph line of the
Union Pacific.
They, in effect, said to the company, that if it would construct a railroad and a telegraph line from the Pacific Ocean
eastward to a connection with the Union Pacific, - the road to
be in all respects one of first class, - and keep them in repair,
so that they could be used at all times by any department of
the government for the transmission of despatches and the
transportation of mails, troops, munitions of war, supplies, and
public stores, at reasonable rates of compensation, not exceeding such as were charged private persons for similar services,
and allow the government at all times the preference in the use
of the road and telegraph, - they would grant the company a
right of way over the public lands for the construction of the
road and telegraph line, and grant to it ten alternate sections of
land on each side of the road, and give it their bonds, each for
the sum of $1,000, payable thirty years after date, with semiannual interest, such bonds to be issued at the rate of sixteen,
thirty-two, or forty-eight the mile, according to the character
of the country over which the road should be constructed; and
would issue patents for the lands, and the subsidy bonds, as

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND

OASES.

each tventy consecutive miles of the road and telegraph should
be completed in the manner prescribed; it being agreed that the
company should pay the bonds as they should mature, and that
for the security of their payment they should constitute a second mortgage upon the whole line of the road and telegraph,
and that one-half of the compensation earned for services to
the government, and, after the completion of the road, five per
cent of its net earnings should be retained and applied to the
payment of the bonds; and also, that the company should complete the road by the 1st of July, 1876, and keep it in repair and
use thereafter, or upon failure to do so, that the government
might take possession of the road and complete it, or keep it
in repair and use as the case might be. And they further, in
effect, said that if these terms and conditions were satisfactory,
the company should file its written acceptance thereof with the
Secretary of the Interior, within six months thereafter ; and
that thereupon there should be a contract between them.
This proposition of the government the Central Pacific accepted, and filed its acceptance as required; and thereupon
the provisions of the act became a contract between it and the
United States, as complete and perfect as could be made by the
most formal instrument. The United States thus came under
obligation to the company to make the grants and issue the bonds
stipulated, upon the construction of the road and telegraph line
in the manner prescribed. The corporate capacity of the company in no respect affected the nature of the contract, or made it
in any particular different from what it would have been had a
natural person been, one of the parties. The company was not
a creature of the United States, and Congress could neither
add to nor subtract from its corporate powers. The exercise
of the right of eminent domain allowed in the Territories was
not the exercise of a corporate power. That right belongs to
the sovereign authority, and whoever exercises it does so as the
agent of that sovereignty. Nor was its character as a State
institution changed by the fact that it was permitted by Congress to extend its road through the territory of the United
States. This permission was no more than the license which
is usually extended by positive agreement, or by comity in the
absence of such agreement, by one State to the corporations of
VOL. Ix.

[Sup. Or.

another State, to do business and own property in its jurisdiction. Such license is not the source of the corporate powers
exercised. Insurance companies, express companies, and, indeed, companies organized for almost every kind of business,
are, by comity, permitted throughout the United States, and
generally throughout the civilized world, to do business, make
contracts, and exercise their corporate powers in a jurisdiction
where, in a strict legal sense, they have no corporate existence.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company, for example, to take
an illustration mentioned by counsel, is a corporation created
under the laws of the State of New York, and, like the Central
Pacific, has been subsidized by the United States. Its ships
visit Central America, California, Japan, and China, and in all
these places it leases or owns wharves, and makes and enforces
contracts necessary to the transaction of its business, yet no
one has ever pretended or suggested that it derived any of
its corporate powers from the United States, or from the authorities of any of the places named. By consent of those
authorities, expressed in terms, or implied in what is understood as their comity, it exercises powers derived solely from
the State of New York.
When, therefore, Congress assented to the extension into the
territory of the United States of the road which the Central
Pacific was authorized by its charter to construct in California,
it was deemed important for the company to obtain also the
consent and authority of the State to act without its limits and
assume responsibilities not originally contemplated. Accordingly, in 1864, the legislature of the State, at its second session
after the adoption of the original railroad act of Congress, in
order to enable the company to comply with its provisions
and conditions, authorized the company to construct, maintain, and operate the road in the territory lying east of the
State, and invested it with the rights, privileges, and powers
granted by the act of Congress, with the reservation, however,
that the company should be subject to all the laws of the State
concerning railroad and telegraph lines, except that messages
and property of the United States, of the State, and of the
company should have priority of transmission and transportation. The extent of the power which was thus reserved we

shall hereafter consider. It is sufficient at present to observe
that it was as ample and complete as it is possible for one sovereignty to exert over institutions of its own creation, and that
its exercise is incompatible with the control asserted by the law
of Congress of 1878, which has given rise to the present suit.
The Central Pacific Company having accepted, as already
stated, the conditions proffered by Congress, proceeded at once
to the execution of its contract. In the face of great obstacles, doubts, and uncertainties, its directors commenced and
prosecuted the work, and within a period several years less
than that prescribed, its telegraph line and road were completed, the latter with all the appurtenances of a first-class
road, and were accepted by the government. Patents for the
land granted and the subsidy bonds mentioned were accordingly
issued to the company. Since then the road and telegraph line
have been kept in repair and use, and the government has enjoyed all the privileges in the transmission of despatches over
the telegraph, and in the transportation of mails, troops, munitions of war, supplies, and public stores over the road, which
were stipulated. There has been no failure on the part of the
company to comply with its engagements, nor is any complaint
of delinquency or neglect in its action made by the government. The road is more valuable now than on the day of its
completion; -it has been improved in its rails; bridges, cars,
depots, turnouts, machine-shops, and all other appurtenances.
Its earnings have been constantly increasing, and it constitutes
to-day a far better security to the United States for the ultimate payment of the subsidy bonds than at any period since
its completion, and to the government it has caused, with the
connecting road of the Union Pacific, an immense saving of
expense. The records of the different departments show an
annual saving, as compared with previous expenditures, in the
item of transportation alone of the mails, troops, and public
stores, of $5,000,000, aggregating at this day over $50,000,000.
Whilst the company was thus complying in all respects with
its engagements, the act of May 7, 1878, was passed, altering
in essential particulars the contract of the company, and greatly
increasing its obligations. By the contract, only one-half of
the compensation for transportation for the government is to

SINKING-FUND

[Sup. Or.

be retained and applied towards the payment of the bonds.
By the act of 1878, the whole of such compensation is to be
retained and thus applied. By the contract, five per cent only
of the net earnings of the road are to be paid to the United
States to be applied upon the subsidy bonds. By the act of
1878, twenty-five per cent of the net earnings are to be thus
paid and applied. By the contract, the only security which
the government had for its subsidy bonds was a second mortgage on the road and its appurtenances and telegraph line; and
the company was allowed to give a first mortgage as 'security
for its own bonds, issued for an equal amount. By the act of
1878, additional security is required for the ultimate payment
of its own bonds, and the subsidy bonds of the United States,
by the creation of what is termed a sinking-fund; that is, by
compelling the company to deposit $1,200,000 a year in the
treasury of the United States, to be held for such payment, or
so much thereof as may be necessary to make the five per cent
net earnings, the whole sum earned as compensation for services, and sufficient in addition to make the whole reach twentyfive per cent of the net earnings.
It is not material, in the view I take of the subject, whether
the deposit of this large sum in the treasury of the creditor be
termed a payment, or something else. It is the exaction from
the company of money for which the original contract did not
stipulate, which constitutes the objectionable feature of the act
of 1878. The act thus makes a great change in the liabilities
of the company. Its purpose, however, disguised, is to coerce
the payment of money years in advance of the time prescribed
by the contract. That such legislation is beyond the power
of Congress I cannot entertain a doubt. The clauses of the
original acts reserving a right to Congress to alter or amend
them do not, in my judgment, justify the legislation. The
power reserved under these clauses is declared to be for a specific purpose. The language in the act of 1862 is as follows:
"And the better to accomplish the object of this act, to promote the public interest and welfare by the construction of
said railroad and telegraph line, and keeping the same in working order, and to secure to the government at all times (but
particularly in time of war) the use and benefits of the same

OASES.

for postal, military, and other purposes, Congress may at any
time-having due regard for the rights of said companies
named herein- add to, alter, amend, or repeal this act."
Sect. 18. The language of the amendatory act of 1864 is
more general: "That Congress may at any time alter, amend,
or repeal this act." The two acts are to be read together;
they deal with the same subject; and are to be treated as if
passed at the same time. Prescott v. Railroad Company, 16
Wall. 608. The limitations, therefore, imposed upon the exercise of the power of alteration and amendment in the act of
1862 must be held to apply to the power reserved in the act
of 1864. They are not repealed, either expressly or impliedly,
by any thing in the latter act. If this be so, the legislation of
1878 can find no support in the clauses. The conditions upon
which the reserved power could be exercised under them did:
not then exist. The road and telegraph had years before been
constructed, and always kept in working order; and the government has at all times been secured in their use and benefits
for postal, military, and other purposes.
But if the reserved power of alteration and amendment be
considered as freed from the limitations designated, it cannot
be exerted to affect the contract so far as it has been executed,
or the rights vested under it. When the road was completed
in the manner prescribed and accepted, the company became
entitled as of right to the land and subsidy bonds stipulated.
The title to the land was perfect on the issue of the patents;
the title to the bonds vested on their delivery. Any alteration
of the acts under the reservation clauses, or their repeal, could
not revoke the title to the land or recall the bonds or change
the right of the company to either. So far as these are concerned the contract was, long before the act of 1878, an executed and closed transaction, and they were as much beyond
the reach of the government as any other property vested in
private proprietorship. The right to hold the subsidy bonds
for the period at which they are to run without paying or
advancing 'money on them before their maturity, except as
originally provided, or furnishing other security than that
originally stipulated, was, on their delivery, as perfect as the
right to hold the title to the land patented unincumbered by

SINKING-Fi UND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

future liens of the government. Any alteration or amendment could only operate for the future and affect subsequent
acts of the company: it could have no operation upon that
which had already been done and vested.
There have been much discussion and great difference of
opinion on many points as to the meaning and effect of a similar reservation in statutes of the States, but on the point that
it does not authorize any interference with vested rights all
the authorities concur. Such was the language of Chief Justice Shaw in the case cited from the Supreme Court of Massachusetts; and such is the language of Mr. Justice Clifford in
the cases cited from this court. And such must be the case, or
there would be no safety in dealing with the government
where such a clause is inserted in its legislation. It could
undo at pleasure every thing done under its authority, and
despoil of their property those who had trusted to its faith.
Commonwealth v. Essex Company, 13 Gray (Mass.), 239; Miller
v. The State, 15 Wall. 478; Holyolce Company v. Lyman, id. 500.
See also Shields v. Ohio, 95 U. S. 319, and Sage v. Dillard,
15 B. Mon. (Ky.) 349.
The object of a reservation of this kind in acts of incorporation is to insure to the government control over corporate
franchises, rights, and privileges which, in its sovereign or
legislative capacity, it may call into existence, not to interfere
with contracts which the corporation created by it may make.
Such is the purport of our language in Tomlinson v. Jessup,
where we state the object of the reservation to be "to prevent
a grant of corporate rights and privileges in a form which will
preclude legislative interference with their exercise, if the public interest should at any time require such interference," and
that "the reservation affects the entire relation between the
State and corporation, and places under legislative control all
rights, privileges, and immunities derived by its charter directly
from the State." 15 Wall. 454. The same thing we repeated,
with greater distinctness, in Railroad Company v. Mfaine,
where we said that by the reservation the State retained the
power to alter the act incorporating the company, in all particulars constitutingthe grant to it of corporate rights,privileges,
and immunities; and that " the existence of the corporation,

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND CASES.

and its franchises and immunities, derived directly from the
State, were thus kept under its control." But we added, that
"rights and interests acquired by the company, not constituting
a part of the contract of incorporation,stand upon a. different
footing." 96 U. S. 499.
Now, there was no grant by the United States to the Central Pacific Company of corporate rights, privileges, and
immunities. No attribute of sovereignty was exercised by
them in its creation. It took its life, and all its attributes and
capacities, from the State. Whatever powers, rights, and
privileges it acquired from the United States it took under its
contract with them, and not otherwise. The relation between
the parties being that of contractors, the rights and obligations
of both, as already stated, are to be measured by the terms and
conditions of the contract. And when the government of the
United States entered into that contract, it laid aside its
sovereignty and put itself on terms of equality with its contractor. It was then but a civil corporation, as incapable as
the Central Pacific of releasing itself from its obligations, or of
finally determining their extent and character. It coula not,
as justly observed by one of the counsel who argued this. case,
" release itself and hold the other party to the contract. It
could not change its obligations and hold its rights unchanged.
It cannot bind itself as a civil corporation,and loose itself by
its sovereign legislative power." This principle is aptly expressed by the great conservative statesman, Alexander Hamilton, inhis report to Congress on the public credit, in 1795:
"When a government," he observes, " enters into a contract
with an individual, it deposes, as to the matter of the contract,
its constitutional authority, and exchanges the character of
legislator for that of a moral agent, with the same rights and
obligations as an individual. Its promises may be justly considered out of its power to legislate,.unless in aid of them. It
is, in theory, impossible to reconcile the two ideas of a promise
which obliges with a power to zace a law which can vary the
effect of it." Hamilton's Works, vol. iii. pp. 518, 519.
When, therefore, the government of the United States
entered into the contract with the Central Pacific, it could no
more than a private corporation or a private individual finally

SINKING-FI ND CASES.

[Sup. Ct.

construe and determine the extent of the company's rights and
liabilities. If it had cause of complaint against the company,
it could not undertake itself, by legislative decree, to redress
the grievance, but was compelled to seek redress as all other
civil corporations are compelled, through the judicial tribunals.
If the company was wasting its property, of which no allegation is made, or impairing the security of the government, the
remedy by suit was ample. To declare that one of two contracting parties is entitled, under the contract between them,
to the payment of a greater sum than is admitted to be payable, or to other or greater security than that given, is not a
legislative function. It is judicial action ; it is the exercise of
judicial power, - and all such power, with respect to any transaction arising under the laws of the United States, is vested by
the Constitution in the courts of the country.
In the case of The Commonwealth v. The Proprietorsof New
Bedford Bridge, a corporation of Massachusetts, the Supreme
Court of that State, speaking with reference to a contract
between the parties, uses this language: "Each has equal
rights and privileges under it, and neither can interpret its
terms authoritatively so as to control and bind the rights of
the other. The Commonwealth has no more authority to construe the charter than the corporation. By becoming a party
to a contract with its citizens the government divests itself of
its sovereignty in respect to the terms and conditions of the
contract and its construction and interpretation, and stands in
the same position as a private individual. If it were otherwise, the rights of parties contracting with the government
would be held at the caprice of the sovereign, and exposed to
all the risks arising from the corrupt or ill-judged use of misguided power. The interpretation and construction of contracts when drawn in question belong exclusively to the judicial
department of the government. The legislature has no more
pow6r to construe their own contracts with their citizens than
those which individuals make with each other. They can do
neither without exercising judicial powers which would be
contrary to the elementary principles of our government, as
set forth in the Declaration of Rights." 2 Gray, 350.
In that case the charter of the corporation authorized the

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND OASES.

building of a toll-bridge across a navigable river, with two
suitable draws at least thirty feet wide. A subsequent act
required draws to be made of a greater width; but the court
held that the question whether the draws already made were
suitable, and constructed so as not unreasonably or unnecessarily to obstruct or impede public navigation, was not a question to be determined by the legislature, or by the corporation,
but by the courts. It was a question which could not be
authoritatively determined by either party so as to control and
bind the other. "Like all other matters involving a controversy concerning public duty and private rights," said the
court, "it is to be adjusted and settled in the regular tribunals,
where questions of law and fact are adjudicated on fixed and
established principles, and according to the forms and usages
best adapted to secure the impartial administration of justice."
In the case at bar, the government, by the act of 1878, under-:
takes to decide authoritatively what the obligations of the
Central Pacific are, and in effect declares that if the directors
of the company do not respect its construction, and obey its
mandates, founded upon such construction, they shall be subject to fine and imprisonment.
The distinction between a judicial and a legislative act is
well defined. The one determines what the law is, and what
the rights of parties are, with reference to transactions already
had; the other prescribes what the law shall be in future cases
arising under it. Wherever an act-undertakes to determine a
question of right or obligation, or of property, as the foundation
upon which it proceeds, such act is to that extent a judicial
one, and not the proper exercise of legislative functions. Thus
an act of the legislature of Illinois authorizing the sale of the
lands of an intestate, to raise a specific sum, to pay certain
parties their claims against the estate of the deceased for
moneys advanced and liabilities incurred, was held unconstitutional, on the ground that it involved a judicial determination
that the estate was indebted to those parties for the moneys
advanced and liabilities incurred. The ascertainment of indebtedness from one party to another, and a direction for its
payment, the court considered to be judicial acts which could
not be performed by the legislature. 3 Scam. 238. So also

[Sup. Ct.

an act of the legislature of Tennessee authorizing a guardian
of infant heirs to sell certain lands of which their ancestor
died seised, and directing the proceeds to be applied to the payment of the ancestor's debts, was, on similar grounds, held to
be unconstitutional.
Jones v. Perry, 10 Yerg. (Tenn.) 59.
Tested by the principle thus illustrated, the act of 1878 must
be held in many ways to transcend the legislative power of
Congress.
I cannot assent to the doctrine which would ascribe to the
Federal government a sovereign right to treat as it may choose
corporations with which it deals, and would exempt it from
that great law of morality which should bind all governments,
as it binds all individuals, to do justice and keep faith. Because
it was deemed important, on the adoption of the Constitution,
in the light of what was known as tender laws, appraisement
laws, stay laws, and instalment laws of the States, which Story
says had prostrated all private credit and all private morals,
to insert a clause prohibiting the States from passing any law
impairing the obligation of contracts, and no clause prohibiting
the Federal government from like legislation is found, it is
argued that no such prohibition exists.
"It is true," as I had occasion to observe in another case,
"there is no provision in the Constitution forbidding in express
terms such legislation. And it is also true that there are express powers delegated to Congress, the execution of which
necessarily operates to impair the obligation of contracts. It
was the object of the framers of that instrument to create a
national government, competent to represent the entire country
in its relations with foreign nations, and to accomplish by its
legislation measures of common interest to all the people, which
the several States in their independent capacities were incapable of effecting, or if capable, the execution of which would be
attended with great difficulty and embarrassment. They therefore clothed Congress with all the powers essential to the successful accomplishment of these ends, and carefully withheld
the grant of all other powers. Some of the powers granted,
from their very nature, interfere in their execution with contracts of parties. Thus war suspends intercourse and commerce
between citizens or subjects of belligerent nations ; it renders

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND OASES.

during its continuance the performance of contracts previously
made, unlawful. These incidental consequences were contemplated in the grant of the war power. So the regulation of
commerce and the imposition of duties may so affect the prices
of articles imported or manufactured as to essentially alter the
value of previous contracts respecting them; but this incidental
consequence was seen in the grant of the power over commerce
and duties. There can be no valid objection to laws passed in
execution of express powers, that consequences like these follow
incidentally from their execution. But it is otherwise when
such consequences do not follow incidentally, but are directly
enacted."
"The only express authority for any legislation affecting the
obligation of contracts is found in the power to establish a
uniform system of bankruptcy, the direct object of which is to
release insolvent debtors from their contracts upon the surrender of their property."
12 Wall. 663. From this express
grant in the case of bankrupts the inference is deducible, that
there was no general power to interfere with contracts. If
such general power existed, there could have been no occasion
for the delegation of an express power in the case of bankrupts.
The argument for the general power from the absence of a
special prohibition proceeds upon a misconception of the nature
of the Federal government as one of limited powers. It can
exercise only such powers as are specifically granted or are
necessarily implied. All other powers, not prohibited to the
States, are reserved to them or to the people. As I said in
the case referred to, the doctrine that where a power is not expressly forbidden it may be exercised, would change the whole
character of our government. According to the great commentators on the Constitution, and the opinions of the. great
jurists, who have studied and interpreted its meaning, the true
doctrine is, that where a power is not in terms granted, and is
not necessary or proper for the exercise of a power thus granted,
it does not exist. It would not be pretended, for example, had
there been no amendments to the Constitution as originally
adopted, that Congress could have passed a law respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,
or abridging the freedom of speech, or the right of the. people

[-Sup. t

to assemble and petition for a redress of grievances. The
amendments prohibiting the exercise of any such power were
adopted in the language of the preamble accompanying them,
when presented to the States, "in order to prevent misconception or abuse" of the powers of the Constitution.
Independent of these views, there are many considerations
which lead to the conclusion that the power to impair contracts, by direct action to that end, does not exist with the
general government. In the first place, one of the objects of
the Constitution, expressed in its preamble, was the establishment of justice, and what that meant in its relations to contracts is not left, as was justly said by the late Chief Justice,
in iHepburn v. Griswold, to inference or conjecture.

As he

observes, at the time the Constitution was undergoing discussion in the convention, the Congress of the Confederation was
engaged in framing the ordinance for the government of the
Northwestern Territory, in which certain articles of compact
were established between the people of the original States and
the people of the Territory, for the purpose, as expressed in the
instrument, of extending the fundamental principles of civil
and religious liberty, upon which the States, their laws and
constitutions, were erected. By that ordinance it was declared, that, in the just preservation of rights and property,
"no law ought ever to be made, or have force in the said Territory, that shall, in any manner, interfere with or affect private
contracts or engagements bona fide and without fraud previously
formed." The same provision, adds the Chief Justice, found
more condensed expression in the prohibition upon the States
against impairing the obligation of contracts, which has ever
been recognized as an efficient safeguard against injustice; and
though the prohibition is not applied in terms to the government of the United States, he expressed the opinion, speaking
for himself and the majority of the court at the time, that it
was clear "that those who framed and those who adopted the
Constitution intended that the spirit of this prohibition should
pervade the entire body of legislation, and that the justice
which the Constitution was ordained to establish was not
thought by them to be compatible with legislation of an opposite tendency." 8 Wall. 623.

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND CASES.

Similar views are found expressed in the opinions of other
judges of this court. In Calder v. Bull, which was here in
1798, Mr. Justice Chase said, that there were acts which the
Federal and State legislatures could not do without exceeding
their authority, and among them he mentioned a law which
punished a citizen for an innocent act; a law that destroyed
or impaired the lawful private contracts of citizens; a law
that made a man judge in his own case; and a law that took
the property from A. and gave it to B. "It is against all
reason and justice," he added, "for a people to intrust a legislature with such powers, and therefore it cannot be presumed
that they have done it. They may command what is right
and prohibit what is wrong; but they cannot change innocence
into guilt, or punish innocence as a crime, or violate the right
of an antecedent lawful private contract, or the right of private
property. To maintain that a Federal or State legislature
possesses such powers if they had not been expressly restrained,
would, in my opinion, be a political heresy altogether inadmissible in all free republican governments." 3 Dall. 388.
In Ogden v. Saunders, which was before this court in 1827,
Mr. Justice Thompson, referring to the clauses of the Constitution prohibiting the State from passing a bill of attainder, an
ex post facto law, or a law impaifing the obligation of contracts,
said: "Neither provision can strictly be considered as introducing any new principle, but only for greater security and
safety to incorporate into this charter provisions admitted by
all to be among the first principles of our government. No
State court would, I presume, sanction and enforce an ex post
facto law, if no such prohibition was contained in the Constitution of the United States; so, neither would retrospective
laws, taking away vested rights, be enforced. Such laws are
repugnant to those fundamental principles upon which every
just system of laws is founded."
.n the Federalist, Mr. Madison declared that laws impairing
the obligation of contracts were contrary to the first principles
of the social compact and to every principle of sound legislation;
and in the Dartmouth College Case Mr. Webster contended
that acts, which were there held to impair the obligation of
contracts, were not the exercise of a power properly legislative,

SINKINGm-FUND CASES.

[Sup. Ot.

as their object and effect was to take away vested rights.

"To

justify the taking away of vested rights," he said, "there must
be a forfeiture, to adjudge upon and declare which is the proper
province of the judiciary." Surely the Constitution would
have failed to establish justice had it allowed the exercise of
such a dangerous power to the Congress of the United States.
In the second place, legislation impairing the obligation of
contracts impinges upon the provision of the Constitution
which declares that no one shall be deprived of his property
without due process of law; and that means by law in its regular course of administration through the courts of justice.
Contracts are property, and a large portion of the vealth of
the country exists in that form. Whatever impairs their value
diminishes, therefore, the property of the owner; and if thatbe
effected by direct legislative action operating upon the contract,
forbidding its enforcement or transfer, or otherwise restricting
its use, the owner is as much deprived of his property without
due process of law as if the contract were impounded, or the
value it represents were in terms wholly or partially confiscated.
In the case at bar the contract with the Central Pacific is,
as I have said, changed in essential particulars. The company
is compelled to accept it in its changed form, and by legislative
decree, without the intervention of the courts, that is, without
due process of law, to pay out of its earnings each year to its
contractors, the United States, or deposit with them, a sum
that may amount to $1,200,000, and this, twenty years before
the debt to which it is to be applied becomes due and payable
by the company. If this taking of the earnings of the company
and keeping them from its use during these twenty years to
come is not depriving the company of its property, it would be
difficult to give any meaning to the provision of the Constitution. It will only be necessary hereafter to give to the seizure
of another's property or earnings a new name, - to call it the
creation of a sinking-fund, or the providing against the possible
to get rid of the
wastefulness or improvidence of the owner,constitutional restraint. To my mind the evasion of that
clause, the frittering away of all sense and meaning to it, are
insuperable objections to the legislation of Congress. Where
contracts are impaired, or when operating against the govern-

Oct. 1878.]

SINKING-FUND OASES.

ment are sought to be evaded and avoided by legislation, a
blow is given to the security of all property. If the government will not keep its faith, little better can be expected from
the citizen. -If contracts are not observed, no property will in
the end be respected; and all history shows that rights of persons are unsafe where property is insecure. Protection to one
goes with protection to the other; and there can be neither
prosperity nor progress where this foundation of all just govern ient is unsettled. "The moment," said the elder Adams,
"the idea is admitted into society that property is not as sacred
as the laws of God, and that there is not a force of law and
public justice to protect it, anarchy and tyranny commence."
I am aware of the opinion which prevails generally that the
Pacific railroad corporations have, by their accumulation of
wealth, and the numbers in their employ, become so powerful
as to be disturbing and dangerous influences in the legislation
of the country; and that they should, therefore, be brought by
stringent measures into subjection to the State. This may be
true; I do not say that it is not; but if it is, it furnishes no
justification for the repudiation or evasion of the contracts
made with them by the government. The law that protects
the wealth of the most powerful, protects also the earnings of
the most humble; and the law which would confiscate the
property of the one would in the end take the earnings of the
other.
There are many other objections to the act of Congress besides those I have mentioned, each to my mind convincing;
but why add to what has already been said? If the reasons
given will not convince, neither would any others which could
be presented. I will, therefore, refer only to the interference
of the law with the rights of the State of California.
The Central Pacific being a State corporation, the law creating it is, by the Constitution of California, subject to alteration,
amendment, and repeal by its legislature at any time, - a power
which the legislature can neither abdicate nor transfer. In its
assent given to the company to extend its road into the territory
of the United States, - the general government having authorized the extension, - the legislature reserved the same control
which it possesses over other railroad and telegraph companies

SINKING-FUND OASES.

[Sup. Or.

created by it. That control under the new constitution goes,
as is claimed, to the extent of regulating the fares and freights
of the company, thus limiting its income or earnings; and of
supervising all its business, even to the keeping of its accounts,
making disobedience of its directors to the regulations established for its management punishable by fine and imprisonment;
and the legislature may impose the additional penalty of a forfeiture of the franchises and privileges of the company. The
law in existence when the corporation was created, and still in
force, requires the creation of a sinking-fund by the company
to meet its bonds, and under it large sums have been accumulated for that purpose, and still further sums must be raised.
In a word, the law of the State undertakes to control and manage the corporation, in all particulars required for the service,
convenience, and protection of the public; and can there be a
doubt in the mind of any one that over its own creations the
State has, within its own territory, as against the United States,
the superior authority? Yet the power asserted by the general
government in the passage of the act of 1878 would justify
legislation affecting all the affairs of the company, both in the
State and in the Territories of the United States. It could
treble the amount of the sum to be annually deposited in the
sinking-fund; it could command the immediate deposit of the
entire amount of the ultimate indebtedness; it could change
the order of the liens held by the government and the firstmortgage bondholders; it could extend the lien of the government beyond the property to the entire income of the company,
and, in fact, does so by the act in question (sect. 9) ; it could
require the transportation for the government to be made without compensation; and it could subject the company to burdens
which, if anticipated at the time, would have prevented the
construction of the road. A power thus vast, once admitted to
exist, might be exerted to control the entire affairs of the company, in direct conflict with the legislation of the State ; its
exercise would be a mere matter of legislative discretion in
Congress. Yet it is clear that both governments cannot control and manage the company in the same territory, subjecting
its directors to fine and imprisonment for disobeying their
regulations. Under the Constitution the management of local

affairs is left chiefly to the States, and it never entered into
the conception of its framers that under it the creations of the
States could be taken from their control. Certain it is that
over no subject is it more important for their interests that
they should retain the management and direction than over
corporations brought into existence by them. The decision of
the majority goes a great way - further, it appears to me,
than any heretofore made by the court -to
weaken the authority of the States, in this respect, as against the will of
Congress. According to my understanding of its scope and
reach, the United States have only to make a contract with a
State corporation, and a loan to it, to oust the jurisdiction of
the State, and place the corporation under their direction. It
would seem plain that if legislation, taking institutions of the
State from its control, can be sustained by this court, the government will drift from the limited and well-guarded system
established by our fathers into a centralized and consolidated
government.
