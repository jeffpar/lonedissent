R.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

UNION PAciFio RAmRoAD COMNPANY V. UNITED STATES.
1. The act entitled "An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph
line from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes,"
approved July 1,1862 (12 Stat. 489), after providing for the issue of patents
for land and of bonds to the Union Pacific Railroad Company and other
companies from time to time, as successive sections of their respective roads
should be completed, requires the companies to perform all government
transportation of mails, troops, &c., and to credit the compensation therefor on the government loan; and then adds, that "after said road is completed, until said bonds and interest are paid, at least five per centum of
the net earnings of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment
thereof." Held, 1. That the liability of the Union Pacific Railroad Company to make this payment accrued when it reported, and the President of
the United States accepted, its road as completed, for the purpose of issuing the bonds, though the acceptance was provisional, and security was
required that all deficiencies in construction should be supplied. 2. That
the company having obtained the bonds and agreed in regard to the security, is estopped from denying that the road was then completed.
2. The "earnings" of the road include all the receipts arising from the company's
operations as a railroad company, but not those from the public lands
granted, nor fictitious receipts for the transportation of its own property.
"Net earnings," within the meaning of the law, are ascertained by deducting
fr;u the gross earnings all the ordinary expenses of organization and of
operating the road, and expenditures made bona fide in improvements, and
paid out of earnings, and not by the issue of bonds or stock; but not deducting interest paid on any of the bonded debt of the company.
3. Thejgovernment bonds issued to the company were declared to be a first lien
on the road and property; the act of July 2, 1864 (13 id. 356), authorized
the company to issue an equal amount of first-mortgage bonds, to have
priority over the government bonds. Held, that this priority authorized the
payment of the interest accruing on these first-mortgage bonds out of the
net earnings of the road, in preference to the five per centum payable to
the government, which is only demandable out of the excess in each year.
APPEAL

from the Court of Claims.

This is a suit by the Union Pacific Railroad Company to
recover compensation for services rendered to the United States
prior to 1874, and during a portion of that year 1874, and the
whole of the year 1875. A counter-claim is set up for five per
cent of the net earnings of the company, under the provision
of the sixth section of the act of July 1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489),
that "after the said road is completed, until said bonds and
interest are paid, at least five per centum of the net earn-

UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

ings of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment
thereof." The United States alleges that the road was completed on the 6th of November, 1869, and that since that time a
large amount of net earnings has been realized by the company,
which it has failed to pay or apply to the said bonds. The
company denies this, and alleges that its road was not finished
until Oct. 1,1874, and that it has not realized any net earnings
in any year, since either the 6th of November, 1869, or the 1st
of October, 1874 ; and denies that it was its duty to pay to the
United States annually any money whatever, as and for five
per cent upon its net earnings, to be applied in the manner
aforesaid.
The Court of Claims decided that the road was completed on
the 6th of November, 1869, and that the company did, after
that period, annually realize net earnings to a large amount,
for the six years from Nov. 6, 1869, to Nov. 6, 1875, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $28,052,045.67; and that
five per cent thereof, to wit, the sum of $1,402,602.28, was
payable to the government; whilst one-half of the compensation due for the services rendered by the company to the government, for the period covered by the petition, amounted to
only $593,627.10; and, therefore, that the government was
entitled to recover from the company the difference between
these two sums, amounting to the sum of $808,975.18. From
this judgment the company appealed.
So much of the eighteenth finding by the Court of Claims
as is referred to and commented on in the opinion of the court

That was a

suit brought in the Court of Claims, by the company, to recover
one-half of the compensation due to it for services rendered to
the government between the dates of February, 1871, and February, 1874, against which claim the United States set up a
counter-claim for the interest which it had paid on the subsidy
bonds advanced to the company. This court held that, by the
terms of the acts of Congress granting said subsidies, the company was not required to pay the interest on said bonds until
the maturity of the principal thereof; and therefore the counter-claim of the government was overruled. The present case
arises upon a like suit brought by the company in the Court of
Claims for the recovery of one-half of the compensation due to
it for services rendered to the government during the remainder
of the year'1874 and the whole of the year 1875, including
certain services performed prior to 1874, not included in the
first suit.
The general history of the legislation of Congress in reference
to the Union Pacific Railroad Company and the associated enterprises, and of the policy of the government respecting the
same, is fully stated in our opinion in the former case, and need
not be repeated here. We shall only advert to the several acts,
and to the proceedings and negotiations which have taken place
between the parties, so far as may be necessary to an understanding of the specific questions which are raised in this suit.
The facts are fully set forth by the Court of Claims in its findings. Three principal questions are raised by the acts of Congress and the facts found by the court, which it is necessary for
us to determine.
_irst, When was the road completed?
Secondly, What is included in net earnings?
Thirdly, How and under what conditions are they to be paid?
I. First, as to the completion of the road.
In one sense, a railroad is never completed. There is never,
or hardly ever, a time when something more cannot be done,
and is not done, to render the most perfect road more complete
than it was before. This fact is well exemplified by the history
of the early railroads of the country. At first, many of them
were constructed with a fiat rail, or iron bar, laid on wooden

408

UNION PACIFIC T.R. CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

string-pieces, resulting in what was known, in former times, as
snake-heads- the bars becoming loose, and curving up in such
a manner as to be caught by the cars, and forced through the
floors amongst the passengers. Then came the T rail; and
finally the H rail, which itself passed through many successive
improvements. Finally, steel rails in the place of iron rails
have been adopted as the most perfect, durable, safe, and economical rails on extensive lines of road. Bridges were first
made of wood, then of stone, then of stone and iron. Grades
originally crossed, and, in most cases, do still cross, highways
and other roads on the same level. The most improved plan is
to have them, by means of bridges, pass over, or under, intersecting roads. A single track is all that is deemed necessary to
begin with; but now, no railroad of any pretensions is considered perfect until it has at least a double track. Depots and
station-houses are at first mere sheds, which are deemed sufficient to answer the purpose of business. These are succeeded,
as the means of the company admit, by commodious station and
freight houses, of permanent and ornamental structure. And
so the process of improvement goes on; so that it is often a
nice question to determine what is meant by a complete, firstclass railroad; and if a question of right or obligation between
parties depends upon the completion of such a structure, courts
are obliged to spell out, from the circumstances of the case, and
the language and acts of the parties, what they mean when they
use such terms.
In the present case, we have for our guidance several clauses
in the charter of the Union Pacific Railroad Company (the act
of 1862), in which the terms referred to are used, as well as
the acts of the parties in reference thereto. One of these
clauses is in the fourth section of the act, which contains an
engagement on the part of the government to grant certain
sections of land to the company on the completion of a certain
number of miles of its road. The third section having granted
to the company every alternate section of the public land, designated by odd numbers, to the amount of five alternate sections
per mile on each side of the railroad, on the line thereof, and
within the limits of ten miles, not otherwise disposed of by the
United States, the fourth section proceeds as follows :-

UNION PACIFIC

UNITED STA[TES.

"SECT. 4. That whenever said company shall have completed

forty consecutive miles of any portion of said railroad and telegraph
line, ready for the service contemplated by this act, and supplied
-with all necessary drains, culverts, viaducts, crossings, sidings,
bridges, turnouts, watering-places, depots, equipments, furniture, and
all other appurtenances of a first-class railroad, the rails and all
the other iron used in the construction and equipment of said road
to be American manufacture of the best quality, the President of
the United States shall appoint three commissioners to examine the
same and report to him in relation thereto; and if it shall appear
to him that forty consecutive miles of said railroad and .telegraph
line have been completed and equipped in all respects as required
by this act, then, upon certificate of said commissioners to that
effect, patents shall issue conveying the right and title to said lands
to said company, on each side of the road as far as the same is completed, to the amount aforesaid; and patents shall in like manner
issue as each forty miles of said railroad and telegraph line are completed, upon certificate of said commissioners. . . . Provided,however, that no such commissioners shall be appointed by the President
of the United States unless there shall be presented to him a statement, verified on oath by the president of said company, that such
forty miles have been completed in the manner required by this act,
and setting forth with certainty the points where such forty miles
begin and where the same end, which oath shall be taken before a
judge of a court of record."
By tie act of 1864 (13 Stat. 356), the amount and extent
'of the grant is doubled.
Again, by the fifth section of the act of 1862 it is enacted as
follows

-

5. That, for the purposes herein mentioned, the Secretary
of the Treasury shall, upon the certificate in writing of said commissioners of the completion and equipment of forty consecutive
miles of said railroad and telegraph, in accordance with the provisions of this act, issue to said company bonds of the United States
of 81,000 each, payable in thirty years after date, bearing six per cen" SECT.

per mile for each section of forty miles, and to secure the repayment
to the United States, as hereinafter provided, of the amount of said
bonds so issued and delivered to said company, together with all
-interest thereon which shall have been paid by the United States,

the issue of said bonds and delivery to the company shall ipso facto

telegraph, together with the rolling-stock, fixtures, and property of
every kind and description, and in consideration of which said bonds
may be issued."
By the eleventh section the amount of bonds granted was
to be $48,000 per mile for one hundred and fifty miles through
the Rocky Mountains, and for the same distance including the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, and $32,000 per mile between those
points; and by the act of 1864 the completed sections were
reduced to twenty miles instead of forty.
By the sixth section of the act it is further enacted as follows: "SECT. 6. That the grants aforesaid are made upon condition
that said company shall pay said bonds at maturity, and shall keel)
said railroad and telegraph line in repair and use, and shall at all
times transmit despatches over said telegraph line, and transport
mails, troops and munitions of war, supplies and public stores, upon
said railroad for the government whenever required to do so by any
department thereof, and that the government shall at all times have
the preference in the use of the same for all the purposes aforesaid
(at fair and reasonable rates of compensation, not to exceed the
amounts paid by private parties for the same kind of service), and
all compensation for services rendered for the government shall be
applied to the payment of said bonds and interest until the whole
amount is fully paid. Said company may also pay the United States,
wholly or in part, in the same or other bonds, treasury notes, or other
evidences of debt against the United States, to be allowed at par,
and after said road is completed, until said bonds and interest are
paid,at leastfive per centurn of the net earnings of said road shall
also be annually applied to the payment thereof."
Reading these sections together, it seems hardly possible to
conceive that the word "complet e d," in the last clause of the
sixth section, has any other or different meaning from that
which it has in the fourth and fifth sections; or that the five
per cent of the net earnings should not be demandable by the
government as soon as the whole line was completed in the
same manner in which any forty [or twenty] miles was to be
completed in order to entitle the company to bonds. This con-

elusion is so obvious and self-evident that it hardly needs a word
of argument to maintain it.
Now, the findings of fact show that the company began to
claim the subsidy of lands and bonds for completed sections of
the railroad and telegraph line in June, 1866; and from that
time forward made similar successive applications nearly or
quite every month, tendering the affidavit of the president of
the company as to the completion of the several sections, as required by the act. The first of these affidavits was made on
the 25th of June, 1866, and was in the words following: "John A. Dix, being duly sworn, deposeth and saith, that he is
president of the Union Pacific Railroad Company, and in pursuance
of the requirements of sect. 4 of the act of Congress approved July
1, 1862, entitled ' An Act to aid in the construction of the railroad
and telegraph line from the Missouri! River to the Pacific Ocean,'
&c., he now states, under oath, that one hundred and five consecutive miles of said railroad,, beginning at Omaha and ending at a
point one hundred and five miles westward thereof, on the line designated by the maps of said company on file in the Department of
the Interior, have been completed and equipped in all respects as
required by the act referred to, as he is informed by the engineer
charged with the construction of said line, and as he verily believes
to be true; and he further states, under oath, that one hundred and
five miles of telegraph have been completed for the said one hundred
and five consecutive miles, as lie is also advised by the engineer in
charge.

The last affidavit, relating to the completion of the last section of the road (and indeed extending some fifty miles beyond
the point of division finally agreed upon between the Union
and Central Pacific Railroad Companies), was made on the
18th of May, 1869, afd was in the words following: "Oliver Ames, being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that he is

beginning at the initial point on section 10, opposite western boundary of the State of Iowa, as fixed by the President of the United

the line designated by the maps of said company on file in the Department of the Interior, that have been completed and equipped

"Sworn to, May 13, 1869."
The Court of Claims finds as a matter of fact that " on
the 10th of May, 1869, the last rail of the claimants road was
laid, and about a week afterwards the road was opened over the
entire length to public use for the transportation of passengers
and freight, and for the service of the government; and this
service was from that time forward performed continuously."
It further found that on the 23d of December, 1865, the
President of the United States, under the authority of sect. 4
of the said act of July 1, 1862, appointed commissioners to examine and report upon the first section of forty miles of said
road; and some time prior to April 30, 1866, he appointed
other commissioners to examine and report upon the second
section of twenty-five miles of said road; and after the making
of each of the foregoing affidavits, he appointed other commissioners to examine the sections of the road as successively completed, and report to him in relation thereto. The reports of
the commissioners so appointed were made in the first instance
to the Secretary of the Interior, who transmitted them to the
President, who approved the recommendations of the Secretary
of the Interior by writing his approval thereon. The following
is the first letter of the said secretary, with the President's indorsement thereon : "DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORi,

Territory of Nebraska. The company authorized to build this road
having, as shown in the report of the commissioners, obligated itself
to remedy, within a reasonable time, the deficiencies in the construction of said section, I respectfully recommend that the same be accepted, and proper steps be ordered for the issue of the bonds and
land-grants due the company agreeably to law.

"The within recommendations of the Secretary of the Interior are

Similar reports were made by the Secretary of the Interior,
as the successive sections were completed and reported on by
the commissioners, down to and including the ninth day of February, 1869, and were severally approved by the President;
and the company received the subsidy bonds of the government
in accordance therewith.
As it appeared by the reports of some of the commissioners
that the several sections of road were not, and could not, under
the circumstances be, fully completed up to the ultimate standard of a first-class railroad, though they might be, and actually
were, completed, section by section, so as to admit of transportation and travel over the same, the railroad company, on the
12th of February, 1869, being thereto required by the Attorney-General of the United States, as a guaranty for the ultimate
full completion and equipment of the road, executed an agreement of the last-mentioned date to deposit in the Treasury
Department their own first-mortgage bonds (which by the act
of July 2, 1864, they had been authorized to issue, and which
were to be preferred to the lien of the United States) to the
amount of $3,000,000, to be held by the government -as security
for the completion of the road according to the provisions of
the statutes in that behalf, and until the President, on a proper
examination of the same, should be satisfied that it was so corn-

pleted. At the same time, the company also agreed, by way
of further security, to leave their land-grants with the government, without taking out patents for the same, until the President should be satisfied as aforesaid, - or pro tanto to such
extent as he might not be satisfied.
On the 10th of April, 1869, a joint resolution was passed by
Congress, by which, amongst other things, it was declared that
the common terminus of the Union Pacific and the Central
Pacific railroads should be at or near Ogden. And that the
President was thereby authorized to appoint a board of eminent
citizens, not exceeding five in number, to examine and report
upon the condition of the two roads (the Union Pacific and the
Central Pacific), and what sum, if any, would be required to
complete each of them. And the President was further authorized and required to withhold from them an amount of subsidy
bonds sufficient to secure the full completion of the roads as
first-class roads, or to receive an equal amount of the first-mortgage bonds of the companies. A board of five eminent citizens
was appointed under this resolution in the month of August
following.
In the mean time, two additional reports were made by the
Secretary of the Interior to the President, one on the 27th of
May, 1869, and the other on the 15th of July, 1869, in each
case recommending the acceptance of the sections referred to
therein, and also recommending the issue of bonds therefor, in
accordance with the agreement aforesaid, to the effect that the
company should deposit its first-mortgage bonds with the Secretary of the Treasury to such amount as might be deemed necessary to secure the ultimate completion of the road.
The last of these reports, with the President's indorsement
thereon, is in the words following, to wit: "1DEPA TMXT OF THE INTERIOR,

Pacific Railroad Company, commencing on the road of said company at the 1,000th mile-post west from Omaha and terminating at
the 1,085-pe6 mile-post.
"The majority of said commissioners, in their report, represent
the said section of 85,ph miles ready for present service, and completed and equipped as a first-class railroad, and that the telegraph

It is found by the Court of Claims that on the 22d of July,
1869, in partial performance of this last order of the President,
$640,000 of subsidy bonds were issued to the company,.being.

416

[Sup. Ct.

the subsidy for the section of twenty miles extending from the
1,000th to the 1,020th mile from Omaha, the subsidy bonds on
all the previous sections having been received by the company
before that time.
As before stated, in August, 1869, the President, in accordance with the joint resolution of April 10, 1869, appointed a
board of five eminent citizens, to examine and report upon the
condition of the road, and what sum would be required to complete it as a first-class railroad. This board made a detailed
examination, and on the 30th of October, 1869, made an
elaborate report, specifying a number of particular things at
various points, such as ballasting, embankment, masonry, trestle-work, &c., which required perfecting to put the road in
first-class condition ; estimating the aggregate expense of such
improvements on the whole line from Omaha to Ogden at
81,586,100. They conclude their report as follows: " This
great line, the value of which to the country is inestimable,

and in which every citizen should feel a pride, has been built in
about half the time allowed by Congress, and is now a good and
reliable means of communication between Omaha and Sacramento, well equipped, and fully prepared to carry passengers
and freight with safety and despatch, comparing in this respect
favorably with a majority of the first-class roads in the United
States."
This report being made and accepted, on the 3d of November,
1869, the Secretary of the Interior issued directions to the
Commissioner of the General Land-Office to commence patenting lands to the companies, and to issue patents for one half of
the lands which they were to receive, -the
patents for the
other half to be suspended until further directions, in addition
to the bonds retained, as security for the completion of the
roads in the matters reported deficient or not up to the standard by the said committee.
Up to the 6th of November, 1869, the point at which the
Union Pacific and Central Pacific roads should meet was not
settled; but assuming that the former would go no further
west than Ogden, 1,033-%8W miles from Omaha, the Secretary
of the Treasury on that day ordered that bonds at the rate of
$32,000 per mile for the distance of 13-i% rmiles from the

Oct. 1878.]

417

1,020th mile-post to Ogden should be issued, but ordered that
the register of the treasury should hold $323,488 thereof as
security for the over-issue of first-mortgage bonds by the company, and deliver the balance to it. The reason of withholding these bonds was, that the company, having been authorized
by the act of July 2, 1864, supplementary to its charter, to
issue the same amount of first-mortgage bonds as it was entitled
to receive from the government, and which was accorded a
priority over the lien of the government bonds, and having
actually constructed the road fifty-three miles west of Ogden,
had issued a larger amount of its own bonds than the amount
of subsidy to which it was entitled as the point of division
between its road and that of the Central Pacific was finally
settled. By a subsequent .arrangement with the Central
Pacific Railroad Company, the point of junction between the
two roads was fixed at a point five miles west of Ogden,
which entitled the Union Pacific Company to bonds for such
five additional miles, amounting to $160,000, which it received
in July, 1870, making the total amount of subsidy bonds which
it was entitled to, and did receive, the sum of $27,285,760.
It thus appears that prior to the sixth day of November,
1869, the entire road of the company had, in separate sections,
been reported by it, under the oath of its president, as being
completed and furnished as a first-class railroad, in accordance
with the requirements of the act, and that upon the strength
of these representations, and the corresponding reports of the
commissioners appointed to examine the several sections, it had
been accepted by the President; and that the company, with
the exception of the last $160,000 of bonds, the claim to which
arose from a mutual arrangement between the two companies,
bad received its entire subsidy of government bonds; and had
received an order for the issuing of patents for its grant of
public lands to the extent of one half thereof ; the patents for
the other half being suspended, by virtue of the agreement
made in April, 1869, as security for the more perfect completion of certain parts of the work.
It is urged that the acceptance of the road by the President
up to this period was only provisional, and not final. We
cannot perceive that this makes any difference. It was an
VOL. IX.

27

418

UNION PACIFIC R.R. CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

acceptance by which the company was enabled to receive its
subsidy of government bonds; and was sought by it in order
that it might obtain them.
It seems to us unnecessary to look further, or to review the
subsequent proceedings which took place between the President and the company, in reference to the fulfilment of the
conditions by the latter, on which the issue of the patents for
the remaining lands depended. It appears that another commission was appointed to examine the road in 1874, and that,
on their report, the President was satisfied that all the imperfections, as a security for the removal of which any patents
had been suspended, -were removed. The company insists that
this was the period which should be taken for the completion
of the road in reference to the payment of five per cent of its
net earnings, - a period five years after it had reported the
last section completed according to the act of Congress, and
after the President, by virtue of the agreement aforesaid, had
consented to accept it as completed for the purpose of enabling
the company to draw its subsidy of government bonds, and after
it had received said bonds.
Can a stronger case of estoppel than this well be presented ?
The plea that the government still retained a portion of the
public lands which the company was to receive, as security for
the supply of certain deficiencies in the road, cannot avail to
diminish the strength of the estoppel. This was done by the
voluntary agreement of the company itself. And as, by making this concession, it succeeded in obtaining the formal acceptance of its road for the sake of the benefit to accrue therefrom,
to wit, the procurement of the subsidy bonds, the company
ought to be willing to bear the burden of such acceptance, to
wit, the payment annually of five per cent of the net earnings
of the road on account of the bonds. It would be -an unfair
construction of the acts of the parties under the law, to hold
that the road was completed for one purpose and not for the
other. We think, therefore, that the Court of Claims was
right in deciding that the road was completed on the sixth day
of November, 1869, so far as the duty of the company to
account for five per cent of its net earnings is concerned.
II. The question next arising is, What are the "net earn-

Oct. 1878.]

UNION PACIFIC

R.R.

0o. V. UNITED STATES.

419

ings" for five per cent of which the company became liable to
account, and in what manner are they payable?
In the first place, they are the "net earnings of the road;"
that is, the net earnings of the road as a railroad, including the
telegraph. They have nothing to do with the income or profits
of the company as a holder of public lands. The proceeds of
this source of income are no part of the earnings of the road.
These earnings, however, must be regarded as embracing all
the earnings and income derived by the company from the railroad proper, and all the appendages and appurteriances thereof,
including its ferry and bridge at Omaha, its cars, and all its
property and apparatus legitimately connected with its railroad.
In the present case, but little difficulty is presented in determining what are the proper earnings of the road, except in
one particular. The company insists that the compensation
accruing to it for services performed for the government, under
the sixth section of the act of 1862, should not be estimated
amongst the earnings of the road, in taking an account of net
earnings upon which to calculate the five per cent in question.
That compensation is not receivable by the company,- does
not come into its hands,- at least was not receivable by it
according to the act of 1862, but was directed by the sixth section to be applied to the payment of the subsidy bonds. After
giving this direction, the section proceeds to add, that after the
road is completed, " until said bonds and interest are paid, five
per centum of the net earnings of said road shall also be annually applied to the payment thereof." It is contended that the
net earnings here referred to are intended to be exclusive of
said compensation for government service, no part of which the
company was to receive. It must be admitted that there is
some force in this view. But the majority of the court is of
opinion that the plain letter of the statute cannot be thus varied
by construction. The compensation accruing by means of services performed for the government is unquestionably earnings
of the road and telegraph; and as there are no words in the act
which go to show any intention to except this portion of earnings from the other earnings of the road in estimating the
amount of net earnings, the conclusion arrived at is, that no

420

UNION PACIFIC R.R. CO. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

such exception can be made. The fact that by a subsequent
law the company is allowed to receive in money one-half of the
compensation referred to, removes to a great extent the practical difficulties that have been suggested in this behalf.
There is another item in the table of earnings set forth in the
eighteenth finding of the Court of Claims which may require
consideration. We refer to the seventh item, entitled " company freight." If this means freight for the transportation of
the company's own property over its own road, it ought not to
be put down'as a receipt, unless the same amount is also embraced amongst the expenses on the other side of the account.
How this fact may be we have not before us the means of
knowing. The evidence which the Court of Claims has in its
possession will enable it to determine this matter. We merely
decide that if the item appears only as a receipt or earning,
and is of the character we have supposed, it ought to be excluded from the account.
Having considered the question of receipts or earnings, the
next thing in order is the expenditures which are properly
chargeable against the gross earning in order to arrive at the
"net earnings," as this expression is to be understood within
the meaning of the act. As a general proposition, net earnings
are the excess of the gross earnings over the expenditures defrayed in producing them, aside from, and exclusive of, the
expenditure of capital laid out in constructing and equipping
the works themselves. It may often be difficult to draw a precise line between expenditures for construction, and the ordinary expenses incident to operating and maintaining the road
and works of a railroad company. Theoretically, the expenses
chargeable to earnings include the general expenses of keeping
up the organization of the company, and all expenses incurred
in operating the works and keeping them in good condition and
repair; whilst expenses chargeable to capital include those
which are incurred in the original construction of the works,
and in the subsequent enlargement and improvement thereof.
With regard to the last-mentioned class of expenditures, however, namely, those which are incurred in enlarging and improving the works, a difference of practice prevails amongst
railroad companies. Some charge to construction account every

Oct. 1878.]

UNION PACIFIC

CO. V. UNITED STATES.

421

item of expense, and every part and portion of every item, which
goes to make the road, or any of its appurtenances or equipments,
better than they weie before; whilst others charge to ordinary
expense account, and against earnings, whatever is taken for
these purposes from the earnings, and is not raised upon bonds
or issues of stock. The latter method is deemed the most conservative and beneficial for the company, and operates as a
restraint against injudicious dividends and the accumulation of
a heavy indebtedness. The temptation is, to make expenses
appear as small as possible, so as to have a large apparent surplus to divide. But it is not regarded as the wisest and most prudent method. The question is one of policy, which is usually
left to the discretion of the directors. There is but little
danger that any board will cause a very large or undue portion
of their earnings to be absorbed in permanent improvements.
The practice will only extend to those which may be required
from time to time by the gradual increase of the company's
traffic, the despatch of business, the public accommodation,
and the general permanency and completeness of the.works.
When any important improvement is needed, such as an additional tract, or any other matter which involves a large outlay
of money, the owners of the road will hardly forego the entire
suspension of dividends in order to raise the requisite funds for
those purposes; but will rather take the ordinary course of
issuing bonds or additional stock. But for making all ordinary
improvements, as well as repairs, it is better for the stockholders, and all those who are interested in the prosperity of
the enterprise, that a portion of the earnings should be employed. We think that the true interest of the government,
in this case, is the same as that of the stockholders; and will
be subserved by encouraging a liberal application of the earnings to the improvement of the works. It is better for the
ultimate security of the government in reference to the payment of its loan, as well as for the service which it may require
in the transportation of its property and mails, that a hundred
dollars should be spent in improving the works, than that it
should receive five dollars towards the payment of its subsidy.
If the five per cent of net earnings, demandable from the company, amounted to a new indebtedness, not due before, like a

422

UNION PACIFIC

R.R. Co. v.

UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

rent accruing upon a lease, a more rigid rule might be insisted
on. But it is not so; the amount of the indebtedness is fixed
and unchangeable. The amount of the five per cent and its
receipt at one time or another is simply a question of earlier
or later payment of a debt already fixed in amount. If the
employment of any earnings of the road in making improvements lessens the amount of net earnings, the government
loses nothing thereby. The only result is, that a less amount
is presently paid on its debt; whilst the general security for
the whole debt is largely increased.
We are disposed to agree, therefore, with the judge who delivered the concurring opinion in the court below, that the twentyseventh item of expenditure, as stated in the table of expenses
in the eighteenth finding, entitled " expenditures for station
buildings, shops, &c.," is a charge that may properly be made
against earnings, since, as the fact is, such expenditures were
actually paid therefrom, and were not carried to capital account.
Should the company ever attempt to make a stock or bond
dividend in consideration of such expenditure, the government
would be entitled to demand its due proportion thereof by way
of payment on account of its debt. But as long as such expenditures are fairly and in good faith charged to account of
earnings, we see no good reason for disallowing the charge.
Of course, the allowance of this item will supersede the deduction of fifteen per cent from the seventh item of earnings ;
which item, however, is subject to the observations that have
already been made upon it.
Expenses of the same kind as those included in item 27,
which are contained in other items, and were disallowed by
the Court of Claims, are to be allowed in like manner as those
in item 27, including the expenses for issuing bonds.
We agree with the Court of Claims in its rejection of the
expenditures contained in items 17 to 30 in the table referred
to, excepting item 27. All payments of interest on the bonded
indebtedness of the company should be charged to capital
interest account, and not to current expenditures. Though
payable out of earnings before any dividend can be made to
stockholders, they cannot be deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the " net earnings" of the road, as that term is to be

Oct. 1878.]

UNION PACIFIC IR.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

428

understood in the sixth section of the act. The bonded debt
incurred for the purpose of construction and equipment is but
another form of capital, analogous to preferred stock; and the
interest accruing thereon is in the nature of a dividend on such
capital. It has nothing to do with, and cannot affect, the
amount of the net earnings of the road.
So the expenses of land and town-lot departments, and taxes
on lands and town lots, are expenses properly belonging to the
land department of the company's property. They are entirely
distinct from its expenses as a railroad company; and form
no proper charge, in the accounts, against the earnings of the
road.
The other items disallowed by the court require no particular remark. Their irrelevancy in the account of net earnings
is obvious.
III. We have still to consider the manner in which, and the
conditions subject to which, the five per cent of net earnings
is payable and demandable.
We have seen that by the fifth section of the act of 1862
the issue to the company of the subsidy bonds was to constitute a first mortgage on the whole line of the railroad and
telegraph, together with the rolling-stock, fixtures, and property of every kind and description, [and] in consideration of
which said bonds should be issued. By the act of July 2,
1864, this priority of the government claim was relinquished
in favor of a certain amount of first-mortgage bonds which, by
that act, the company was authorized to issue. The provision
referred to is contained in the tenth section of the act of 1864,
which is as follows: "SECT. 10. And be it further enacted, that sect. 5 of said act
[of July 1, 1862] be so modified and amended that the Union
Pacific Railroad Company, the Central Pacific Railroad Company,
and any other company authorized to participate in the construction of said road, may, on the completion of each section of said
road, as provided in this act and the act to which this act is an
amendment, issue their first-mortgage bonds on their respective
railroad and telegraph lines to an amount not exceeding the
amount of the bonds of the United States, and of even tenor and
date, time of maturity, rate and character of interest, with the

424

[Sup. Ct.

bonds authorized to be issued to said railroad companies respectively.
And the lien of the United States bonds shall be subordinate to
that of the bonds of any or either of said companies hereby authorized to be issued on their respective roads, property, and equipments, except as to the provisions of the sixth section of the act to
which this act is an amendment, relating to the transmission of despatches and the transportation of mails, troops, munitions of war,
supplies, and public stores for the government of the United States."
It is found by the Court of Claims that the Union Pacific
Railroad Company did issue its first-mortgage bonds as authorized by this section, and to the full amount allowed thereby.
The company contends that the interest of these bonds, if not
its other interest, should be charged as an expenditure against
the earnings of the road in taking an account of its net earnings, which would reduce the net earnings of each year by
the amount of said interest. We have already expressed an
opinion that this claim cannot be sustained. The interest on
these bonds do not, any more than the interest of any other
bonds of the company, form any proper portion of the expenditures of the road to be considered in estimating the net earnings mentioned in sect. 6 of the act of 1862.
But whilst we decide against the company on this point, we
are clearly of opinion that the annual interest accruing on
these particular bonds are to be first paid out of the net earnings, before the government can demand its five per cent
thereof. We conceive this to be the legitimate effect of the
concession by the government of its priority. It can hardly
be pretended that, notwithstanding this concession, the five
per cent to be applied in payment of the government bonds
is to be first paid. It seems to us an absurdity to 'say that
these bonds are entitled to a priority, but that the government must be first paid. This would be to grant a priority,
and, in the same breath, to take it back again. It will not
do to say that both must be paid, if there is not enough to
pay both. It is a question between two parties having a claim
against a common fund, and one of them having a priority over
the other.
It may, perhaps, be urged that the first-mortgage bondholders have no lien on the net earnings. But it has the same lien

UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

425

that the government has. Both liens, are coextensive with the
whole property of the company, so far at least as relates to the
railroad and telegraph lines and their equipment and all propeity appurtenant thereto. There is a direction, it is true, that
if the company makes net earnings, it shall pay five per cent
thereof on its debt to the government. But that direction was
contained in the act of 1862; the authority to issue the firstmortgage bonds, and the concession of priority thereto, was
given two years afterwards, and is the controlling enactment.
It cannot be supposed, after this transaction, that the company
is bound to pay the government first, and to allow the interest
on the first-mortgage bonds to go unpaid, or, in order to pay
it, to go out in the money market and make a new loan. Such
could never have been the intention of the law. Not to pay
the interest on the first mortgage would expose the road and
works to be seized and sold, - a result, certainly, that could
not be to the interest of the government, -when we consider
that its entire debt is postponed to the first mortgage, and
would be liable to be lost by such a proceeding. Borrowing
money to pay the interest (if it could be borrowed) would only
be to put off the evil day.
The interest accruing on the first mortgage is as much payable out of the net earnings as the five per cent payable to
government is. It is the proper fund out of which to pay both;
and if but one can be paid, the former has the precedence; or
else the whole government debt might be paid to the exclusion
of the first mortgage, which is admitted to have the priority.
Such a result would be manifestly absurd.
The truth is, that the provision for paying five per cent
of the net earnings on the subsidy debt was a provision for
payment out of a particular fund. If by voluntary agreement
on the part of the government a portion of that fund is appropriated to another purpose (which we think it is), then the
government is entitled to go against the balance only. The
provision created no new obligation or indebtedness, but only
entitled the government to anticipate part payment of a fixed
indebtedness out of a particular fund, if there should be such
a fund. If the fund should not arise, or should be exhausted
by claims to which the government gave priority over its own

426

UNION PACIFIc R.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

claim, there would clearly be nothing for the government to
demand.
It is not like the case of two mortgages, one prior to the
other, and both having claims for interest coming due. In
such case, if both claims are not paid, the one which is not
paid becomes a cause of action, and may be put in suit. Here,
the claim of the government is on the fund alone. If that is
exhausted by its own consent, no cause of action arises. There
is simply nothing left of the fund to which it has a right to
resort.
The government, however, may contend that if there is not
a sufficient surplus of net earnings in one year to pay the five
per cent due for that year, it may be carried over to a succeeding year, and taken out of the surplus thereof. We do not
think that this position is more tenable than the other. Each
year is to stand by itself. If there is a deficit in any year instead of net earnings, such deficit cannot be carried over into
the next year's accounts by the company; and if there are net
earnings which are absorbed by the interest due on the first
mortgage, the claim of five per cent cannot be carried over into
the next year by the government. The one is no more a debt
than the other is a credit. The statute makes the application
an annual one. If the year produqes net earnings sufficient
for the purpose, the government gets its five per cent; if it
does not produce sufficient, the government does not get its
five per cent; and there the account ends for that year. It
was never intended that this account should be carried on from
one year to another.
This seems to us to be the fair and reasonable construction
of the statutes, and one that does no injustice to either of the
parties. The object of Congress in all of them was to extend
a liberal hand in aid of the enterprise which the company undertook to carry out, and not to exact, in addition to the amount
of service which the company was required to perform, the
payment of any part of its loan before maturity, except a small
portion of the net earnings of the road which the company
would be presumed to have in its hands. So far as these were
otherwise disposed of by the government's own consent, the
application to its debt must be regarded as intended to be
waived.

The fact that by the ninth section of the act of March 3,
1871 (16 Stat. 525), the Secretary of the Treasury is required
to pay over in money to the companies one-half of the compensation for the services performed by them for the United
States, has no bearing on the question now under consideration.
The statutes out of which this question arises were all passed
long before, and are to be construed as if the act of 1871 had
never been passed.
We may add, in conclusion, that Congress, by the act passed
May 7, 1878 (20 Stat. 56), supplementary to the acts of 1862
and 1864, has expressly directed that, in estimating the net
earnings of the roads, the interest of the first-mortgage bonds,
as well as the current expenses, is to be deducted from the
gross earnings. Whilst this enactment cannot be -invoked as
furnishing any decisive rule for the construction of the statutes
under review, it at least shows that Congress deems the interest
of said first-mortgage bonds as fairly entitled to priority of
payment out of the earnings of the road, before the payment
of any portion thereof on the government debt. We think,
therefore, that we are justified in supposing that our conclusion
is in harmony with the views of the legislature, as to the justice
and right of the case.
The conclusions to which we have come on the whole case
will require the following modifications of the decree appealed
from: -

First,In estimating the amount of gross earnings, no deduction will be made from the earnings included in items 7 or 12,
as set forth in the table contained in the eighteenth finding of
the Court of Claims, unless it be found that item 7, entitled
"company freight," is for transporting the company's own
property on its road, and is not balanced by being also contained
among the expenditures. If this be the case, then the whole
of item 7 should be struck out.
Secondly, In estimating the amount of expenditures to be
deducted from gross earnings, the claimant should be credited
with the expenditures contained in item 27 of the table of expenditures, and the other expenses which are disallowed by the
Court of Claims, except items 17 to 26 inclusive, and items 28,
29, and 30, which are properly disallowed.

[Sup. Ct.

Thirdly, If with these modifications it should be found that
the net earnings, in any one year, were not more than sufficient
to pay the interest on the first-mortgage bonds accruing in said
year, then the company will not be decreed to pay any portion
of the said five per cent of net earnings for that year. But
if the net earnings were more than sufficient to pay said interest, the excess will be subject, as far as it. will go, to the payment of said five per cent; but the company will not be decreed
to pay any more than said excess.
The decree will be reversed with instructions to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion; and it is
So ordered.

with whom concurred MR.

JUSTICE

dissenting.
I concur with the majority of the court in holding that the
railroad was completed, within the meaning of the sixth section
of the act of 1862, on the sixth day of November, 1869. I concur also in the definition of "net earnings," as the term was
used in that section. But the majority now express the opinion
that if the net earnings in any one year are not more than sufficient to pay the interest on the first-mortgage bonds of the
company in that year, the United States is not entitled to any
portion of five per c6nt of those earnings for that year, though,
if they are more than sufficient to pay that interest, the excess or surplus is subject, so far as it will go, to the payment
of the five per cent. This is substantially holding that the
claim of the government to the annual payment of five per cent
of the company's net earnings, after the completion of the road,
is postponed to the annual interest on the first-mortgage bonds.
To this I cannot assent. It is, I think, based upon an entire
misconstruction of the acts of Congress which gave existence to
the company, and to which alone we can look for the contract
between it and the government. A very few words will indicate my opinion, and show the reasons upon which it rests.
By the fifth section of the act of 1862, the Secretary of the
Treasury was required to issue to the company bonds of the
United States to an amount therein specified. The bonds were
to be issued as a loan, and the section provided as follows:
HARLAgN,

UNION PACIFIC

R.R. Co.

v. UNITED STATES.

429

"And to secure the repayment to the United States, as hereinafter provided, of the amount of said bonds so issued and delivered to said company, together with all interest thereon
which shall have been paid by the United States, the issue of
said bonds and delivery to the company shall, ipso facto, constitute a first mortgage on the whole line of the railroad and telegraph, together with the rolling-stock, fixtures, and property
of every kind and description, and in consideration of which
said bonds maybe issued." This clause describes the lien, and
the only lien, reserved by the United States. It covers the
railroad and telegraph, the rolling-stock and fixtures, and property of every kind and description. It does not cover income
from the property, either gross receipts or net receipts derived
from its use, while it remains in the possession of the company
and before any forfeiture for breach of the conditions of the
mortgage. A mortgage of a property is a very different thing
from a mortgage of its income. The mortgagor, so long as be
remains in possession, or until actual entry by the mortgagee,
may receive the rents and profits to his own use, and is not
accountable for them to the mortgagee. Fitchburg Cotton lVanufactory Corporationv. Hlelven et al., 15 Mass. 268; Boston Bank
v. Reed et al., 8 Pick. (Mass.) 459. Indeed, it is clear law that
a mortgagee has no specific lien upon the rents and profits of
mortgaged premises until condition broken. The Bank of
Ogdensburghv. Arnold and Others, 5 Paige (N. Y.), 38. I think
it very apparent that in the reservation of the lien Congress
did not intend to interfere with or assert rights over the earnings of the railroad, or to prevent their appropriation to the
general uses of the company. They were not intended to be
covered by the lien, or embraced within it. And I am confirmed in this belief by the fact that, immediately following the
clause in the fifth section describing the lien, a right was reserved to the United States to take possession of the road on
failure of the company to redeem the bonds loaned.
Assuming that I am correct in this, I pass to the sixth section of the act, which makes no reference to the lien, though
it imposes duties upon the company. It enacts that the grants
aforesaid are made upon condition that said company shall pay
said bonds at maturity, and shall keep said railroad and tele-

430

UNION PACIFIC

[Sup. Ct.

graph in repair and use, shall transmit despatches at all times
over said telegraph line, and transport mails, troops, &c., for
the government when required, giving to the government the
preference in the use of the road and line for all the purposes
aforesaid. The section then declares that all compensation
(subsequently changed to one-half thereof) for services rendered for the government shall be applied to the payment of
the bonds and interest, so as aforesaid named, until the whole
amount is fully paid. Then follows the clause which the
United States is seeking in this action to enforce. It is as follows: "And after said road is completed, until said bonds and
interest are paid, at least five per centum of the net earnings of
said road shall also be annually applied to the payment thereof."
The grants referred to in this section, and declared to be conditional, are probably those of the right of way and alternate
sections of land given previously in the preceding sections.
They can hardly refer to the loan of bonds. This, however, is
not very material. While it is true that the section refers to
payment of the debt due to the United States, it contains no
allusion to the lien for the security of the debt reserved in the
fifth section. And it can hardly be pretended that performance
of the duties thereby imposed upon the company is secured by
the statutory mortgage. The mortgage is not a security for
having the road and telegraph kept in order, nor for the transmission of despatches, or the transportation for the government,
nor for priority of use by the government, nor for the application to the payment of the bonds of half the compensation for
services to the government. Nor is it any more a security for
the required payment of a percentage of the net earnings.
These duties are secured by the condition attached to the land
grants, and by the implied assumption of the company. They
are entirely collateral to the obligation and lien of the mortgage. They are not a part of it. It is no uncommon thing
that a creditor has several securities for one debt. He may
have a bond and a mortgage to secure its payment; he may
have also a promissory note, or an assignment of stock. Nobody
would claim that in such a case the note and the assignment
are included in the lien of the mortgage.
Having thus shown, as I think, what the lien of the govern-

Oct. 1878.]

UNION PACIFIC

v. UNITED STATES.

431

ment was, what it covered, and what it did not, I pass to the
tenth section of the amending act of 1864, by which, as construed by a majority of the court, the claim of the United
States to a percentage annually of the net earnings of the road,
is postponed to the rights of what is called the first mortgage of
the company. That section authorized the company, and other
companies, to issue their first-mortgage bonds on the roads and
telegraph lines to an amount not exceeding the bonds of the
United States, and of even tenor and date, time of maturity,
rate and character of interest, with the bonds authorized to be
issued to them. It then declared thus: "And the lien of the
United States shall be subordinate to that of the bonds of any
or either of said companies hereby authorized to be issued on
their respective roads, property, and equipments, except as to
the provisions of the sixth section of the act to which this act
is an amendment, relating to the transmission of despatches,
and the transportation of mails, troops, munitions of war,
supplies, and public stores for the government of the United
States."
The first mortgage thus authorized was less comprehensive
than the statutory mortgage of the United States. It did not
include the lands of the company, nor any of its property,
except the road and the telegraph line. It certainly did not
include the earnings of the company. What, then, was subordinated to it? I think nothing but the lien of the United
States bonds, - that lien which was reserved in the fifth section
of the act of 1862. This is the express language of the section.
Whatever right to the railroad and telegraph line the United
States had by virtue of its mortgage, that right was postponed
to the mortgage bonds authorized by this tenth section, and
issued under it. Nothing else was postponed. Subordination
of the lien of the United States to the company's first mortgage
could not have the effect of enlarging the operation and scope
of that mortgage and bringing additional subjects within it.
Surely it did not make the mortgage a lien upon any other
property than that which the company was authorized to mortgage. It did not make it a lien, either prior or subsequent,
upon the lands of the company, or the income or earnings of
its road. And as I think I have shown the duty of the com-

432

UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co. V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

pany to apply annually five per cent of its net earnings, after
the completion of its road, to the payment of its debt to the
United States, was collateral to its other obligations, - a cumulative duty, not embraced in the lien or mortgage reserved by
the United States in the fifth section of the act of 1862, - it
cannot be affected by the tenth section of the act of 1864.
Whatever else was postponed, it was not.
It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the exception from the subordinating clause of those provisions of
the sixth section of the act of 1862, relating to the transmission of despatches, and the transportation of mails, troops,
munitions of war, supplies, and public stores for the government of the United States, implies that the other provisions
of that section, or at least the five per cent provision, were
intended to be subordinated to the lien of the first-mortgage
company bonds. This supposed implication is the principal
reason urged in support of the position taken by a majority of
the court. It is, however, in my judgment, entirely unfounded.
The purpose of the exception appears to me to be very plain.
As I have noticed, the section authorized the company to issue
their first-mortgage bonds upon the railroad and the telegraph
line, and enacted that the lien of the United States bonds should
be subordinate to the company's first-mortgage bonds. Subordinate, clearly, only in its effect upon that which was covered
by the company's mortgage, namely, the road and the telegraph line. But if the company's mortgage was permitted to
be without exception the paramount lien upon the road and
telegraph line, the right secured to the United States by the
sixth section of the act of 1862 to the transmission of despatches, and transportation of the mails, &c., might be totally
destroyed by a foreclosure of the mortgage and a sale under it.
To guard against this possibility was evidently the sole purpose of the exception, and its necessity is manifest. I repeat,
if the company's authorized mortgage on the railroad and the
telegraph line were permitted to be, without restriction, a
paramount lien, the preferential right secured to the United
States by the conditions of the sixth section of the act of 1862
- the right to the transmission of despatches and transportation of mails, stores, munitions of war, &c., in preference to

Oct. 1878.]

UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co. v. UNITED STATES.

433

others - would have been at the mercy of the company's
mortgagees. That right of priority Congress was not willing to
endanger. The exception was introduced to avert the danger
of its loss. Congress, in effect, said to the company, " Though
we agree that your mortgage shall be the first lien upon the
road and the telegraph line, yet no foreclosure of it, no taking
possession under it, and no sale shall interfere with the right
of the United States to the transmission of despatches and to
transportation in preference to all others." To save that right
the exception was necessary. It had reference solely to the
operation of the company's mortgage upon the road, upon
which a preferential right to transportation had been -reserved,
and to the telegraph line, along which government despatches
were first to be carried. I cannot believe it had any other
purpose or intent, much less that it was intended to operate as
a grant, or to postpone the other rights assured to the United
States in the sixth section. The implication that every duty
in that section imposed upon the company, except the one
expressly mentioned, was intended to be subordinated to the
lien of the company's bonds is too unreasonable to be accepted,
and it will not be claimed. Yet such must be the extent of
the implication, if the exception means what the majority of
the court think it means. If the duty of the company to apply
to the payment of its bonds a percentage of its net earnings
annually after the completion of its road is postponed to the
rights of the first-mortgage bondholders, so is the duty to apply
one-half the compensation for services rendered for the government, and so is the duty to keep the railroad and telegraph
line in repair, by parity of reason. Those rights of the government and the right to the percentage of the earnings stand
alike. They are all reserved by the tenth section of the act of
1864.
My conclusion, therefore, is that nothing in the tenth section
of the act of 1864 postpones the right of the government to
recover five per cent of the net earnings of the road before any
thing is deducted from those earnings for either principal or
interest of the first-mortgage bonds of the company.
It may be that the construction of the acts of Congress for
which I contend, if adopted by the court, would not increase

Certain bonds of a railroad company in Louisiana, promising to pay to the
bearer either X225 sterling in London, or $1,000 in New York or in New
Orleans, declared that the president of the company was authorized to fix
by his indorsement the place of payment. On their back were printed the
following words: "I hereby agree that the within bond and the interest
coupons thereto attached shall be payable in -.
" The blank for the
place of payment was not filled. The bonds were never issued by the company, but were seized and carried off during the late war. They, and the
past-due coupons thereto attached, were purchased in New York for a very
small consideration. Held, 1. That, in the absence of the required indorsement, the uncertainty of the amount payable is a defect which deprives the
bonds of the character of negotiability. 2. That the purchaser was affected
with notice of their invalidity, and does not sustain the position of a bonafide
holder without notice.
