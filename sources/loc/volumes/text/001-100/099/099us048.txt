[Sup. Ct.

PLATT v. UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY.
1. By the third section of the act of Congress approved July 1, 1862 (12 Stat.
489), incorporating the Union Pacific Railroad Company, lands were
granted to the company "for the purpose of aiding in the construction
of the railroad and telegraph line, and to secure the safe and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war, and public stores thereon,"
and it was enacted that all such lands "not sold or disposed of" by the
company before the expiration of three years after the completion of the
entire road should be subject to settlement and pre-emption, like other
lands. Upon a consideration of this and other provisions of the act and
of the amendatory act of July 2, 1864 (13 id. 356),--Held, 1. That these
provisions should be so construed as to effect their primary object, which
was to furnish aid in and during the construction of the road, and that it
cannot be controlled or defeated by the secondary and subordinate purpose
of opening to settlement and pre-emption such of the lands as should not
be sold or disposed of within the designated period. 2. That the words
"or disposed of" are not redundant, nor are they synonymous with "sold,"
but they contemplate a use of the lands granted different from the sale of
them, and that a mortgage of them is such a use. 3. That the mortgage
of them executed by the company April 16, 1867, for the purpose of raising
money necessary to continue and complete the construction of the road,
disposed of them within the meaning of the act, and was authorized thereby.
4. That the mortgage was an hypothecation of the fee, and not merely of
an estate determinable at the expiration of three years from the completion
of the road, and the debt it was given to secure not having matured, the
lands are not subject to pre-emption. Sed qu'ere, whether the remnants that
may be unsold when the mortgage debt shall be paid will not then be subject to pre-emption.
2. In construing a statute, aid may be derived from attention to the state of
things as it appeared to the legislature when the statute was enacted.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Nebraska.
This was a bill in equity filed Sept. 28, 1878, by William H.
Platt, to enjoin the Union Pacific Railroad Company from
prosecuting an action of ejeetment which it brought against
him the twenty-third day of that month, for the recovery of
a certain quarter-section of land situate in the county of Hall
and State of Nebraska, whereof he was in possession, claiming
the equitable title thereto. The company answered. The case
was heard upon the pleadings, and the bill dismissed. Platt
appealed here.
Platt entered upon the land in the year 1874, and thereafter

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT v. UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co.

remained in possession. He made improvements thereon, and
performed all the conditions which entitled him, as a qualified pre-emptor, to a preference right of purchase, if the land
were subject to pre-emption. He duly filed, Sept. 21, 1878,
his declaratory statement, made the requisite proofs before
the proper officers, paid the receiver of the local land-office
$200, being at the rate of $1.25 per acre, and took a receipt
therefor.
The land is part of an odd-numbered section, situate within
ten miles of the road of the company, and is included in the
grant made by the act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri River to the Pacific
Ocean, &c., approved July 1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489), and the
amendatory act of July 2, 1864 (13 Stat. 356). The company
accepted the grant, located the route of its road and filed a
map thereof within the requisite time, and, in order to raise
the means necessary to continue and complete the work on its
road which was then constructing, issued, April 16, 1867, its
coupon bonds to the amount of $10,400,000, payable twenty
days after the date thereof, with semi-annual interest. To
secure the payment of them it executed and duly acknowledged a certain indenture of that same date, covering the
granted lands, which it caused to be recorded in said Hall
County before July 1, 1872. The United States issued a
patent, bearing date March 26, 1875, to the c6mpany for the
granted lands not theretofore conveyed to it.
The company refused to accept the money so paid by Platt
to the receiver of the land-office.
The bill and answer set up different dates when the road was
completed; the first alleging it to be before July, 1869, and
the latter Nov. 14, 1874, when it was finally accepted by the
government.
The act of 1862 provides as follows:
"SECT. 3. And be it further enacted, that there be and is hereby
granted to the said company, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of said railroad and telegraph line, and to secure the safe
and speedy transportation of the mails, troops, munitions of war,
and public stores thereon, every alternate section of public land,
designated by odd numbers, to the amount of five alternate sections

per mile on each side of said railroad, on the line thereof, and within
the limits of ten miles on each side of said road, not sold, reserved,
or otherwise disposed of by the United States, and to which a preemption or homestead claim may not have attached, at the time the
line of said road is definitely fixed: -Provided, that all mineral
lands shall be excepted from the operation of this act; but where
the same shall contain timber, the timber thereon is hereby granted
to said company. And all such lands so granted by this section
which shall not be sold or disposed of by said company within
three years after the entire road shall have been completed, shall
be subject to settlement and pre-emption like other lands, at a price
not exceeding $1.25 per acre to be paid to said company.
"SECT. 4. And be it further enacted, that whenever said company
shall have completed forty consecutive miles of any portion of said
railroad and telegraph line ready for the service contemplated by
this act, and supplied with all necessary drains, culverts, viaducts,
crossings, sidings, bridges, turnouts, watering-places, depots, equipments, furniture, and all other appurtenances of a first-class railroad, - the rails and all the other iron used in the construction and
equipment of said road to be American manufacture of the best
quality, - the President of the United States shall appoint three
commissioners to examine the same and report to him in relation
thereto; and if it shall appear to him that forty cosecutive miles
of said railroad and telegraph line have been completed and
equipped in all respects as required by this act, then, upon certificate of said commissioners to that effect, patents shall issue
conveying the right and title to said lands to said company, on
each side of the road, as far as the same is completed, to the amount
aforesaid; and patents shall in like manner issue as each forty miles
of said railroad and telegraph line are completed upon certificate of
said commissioners'. .
The amendatory act changes the number of sections per mile
granted by the third section of the original act from "five " to
"ten," and the limits of the grant from "ten " to "twenty,"
miles on each side of the road; and declares the company to
be entitled to patents, upon the construction and acceptance
of each "twenty" consecutive miles of road.
The act of 1862 provides that upon the completion of forty
consecutive miles (changed to twenty by the act of 1864) of
said road, bonds of the United States of $1,000 each, bearing

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC

six per cent semi-annual interest, due at thirty years from date,
shall be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury to the company,
to the amount of sixteen bonds per mile (a larger amount per
mile being allowed between certain designated points); and
that " to secure the repayment to the United States, as hereinafter provided, of the amount of the said bonds so issued and
delivered to said company, together with all interest thereon
which shall have been paid by the United States, the issue of
said bonds and delivery to the company shall ipso facto constitute a first mortgage on the whole line of the railroad and
telegraph, together with the rolling-stock, fixtures, and property of every kind and description, and in consideration of
which said bonds may be issued; and on the refusal or failure
of said company to redeem said bonds or any part of them
when required so to do by the Secretary of the Treasury, in
accordance with the provisions of this act, the said road, with
all the rights, functions, immunities, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, and also all lands granted to the said company
by the United States which at the time of said default shall
remain in the ownership of the said company, may be taken
possession of by the Secretary of the Treasury for the use and
benefit of the United States: Provided, this section shall not
apply to that part of any road now constructed."
The tenth section of the act of 1864 provides that sect. 5
of the act of 1862 "be so modified and amended that the Union
Pacific Railroad Company, the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and any other company authorized to participate in
the construction of said road, may, on the completion of each
section of said road, as provided in this act and the act to
which this act is an amendment, issue their first-mortgage
bonds on their respective railroad and telegraph lines to an
amount not exceeding the amount of the bonds of the United
States, and of even tenor and date, time of maturity, rate and
character of interest, with the bonds authorized to be issued
to said railroad companies respectively. And the lien of the
United States bonds shall be subordinate to that of the bonds
of any or either of said companies hereby authorized to be
issued on their respective roads, property, and equipments,
except as to the provisions of the sixth section of the act to

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC

R.R. Co.

[Sup. Ct.

which this act is an amendment, relating to the transmission
of despatches and the transportation of mails, troops, munitions
of 'war, supplies, and public stores for the government of the
United States. And said section is further amended by striking out the word 'forty' and inserting in lieu thereof the words
'on each and every section of not less than twenty.'"
The indenture executed by the company to secure its bonds
conveys in fee to trustees, upon certain trusts, terms, and conditions, the lands granted to it by the acts of Congress. One
condition is, "that if the said party of the first part shall well
and truly pay, or cause to be paid, to the holders of the said
bonds, and every of them, the principal sums of money therein
mentioned, according to the tenor thereof, with the interest
thereon, at the times and in the manner hereinbefore provided,
according to the true intent and meaning of these presents,
then and from thenceforth this indenture and the estate hereby
granted shall cease and determine, and all the right, title, and
interest in any and all property hereby conveyed to the parties
of the second part, not then disposed of under the powers hereby
conferred, shall revert to and vest in the said party of the first
part."
It further provides that the lands shall be under the management and control of the company, to be by it sold or contracted to be sold for such prices and on such terms of payment
as shall be mutually agreed upon by the company and the trustees; that the trustees shall, upon payment of the purchasemoney of the several tracts which may be sold, receive and
apply the same, and the proceeds of all sales made by them
of lands so conveyed to them, to the sole and exclusive purpose
of the payment of the said coupon bonds, until the same and
the whole thereof shall be fully paid and satisfied, and thereafter to reconvey to the company the residue of said lands
remaining unsold; that in default of the payment of either
the interest or principal of the said coupon bonds, according
to the tenor and effect thereof, for the period of six months
after demand at the place of payment, the trustees are authorized to enter into and take possession of the lands and
foreclose the indenture; that in case of such default for the
period of one year, then the principal sum of said bonds is to

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co.

become due and payable, and the said trustees are authorized
to take possession of the lands, foreclose said indenture by
selling, at public Auction in the city of Omaha or New York,
the lands, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay and
discharge said coupon bonds, or so many thereof as are then
outstanding and unpaid; and that in case of any sale upon
any such foreclosure, or at any public auction, the trustees are
empowered to make, execute, and deliver a conveyance of the
lands so sold, which shall convey to the purchaser all the rights
and privileges of the company in and to the property so sold,
to the same extent as the company shall have previously enjoyed and held the same.
The indenture further declares "that all the provisions of
said acts of Congress, so far as they are applicable, are hereby
made, and shall be deemed and taken to be, a part of this
instrument, and the said provisions in all that concerns the
sale and disposal of the said lands hereby conveyed to the
parties of the second part are to be observed and strictly and
faithfully carried out and fulfilled."
The company has made no sale or disposition of the land in
controversy otherwise than by said indenture, and bonds to the
amount of $7,000,000 are still outstanding.
ir. James Lowndes for the appellant.
The Attorney -General for the United States.
The controlling question is, Had the United States the right
to sell, in accordance with the provisions of the pre-emption
laws and at the minimum price, the tract of land involved in
this controversy ? In disposing of it, it is not important to
determine at which of the dates alleged by the respective
parties the road was completed, as, at the time of the appellant's entry, more than three years had elapsed from the
date claimed by the company as that when the road was
accepted.
No sale or disposition of the land within the meaning of the
act has been made by the company. It may be that "dispose
of" has not such an exact and universally accepted technical
meaning as "sell," "exchange," "mortgage."
It popularly
signifies "to sell." Webster's definition is, "to exercise finally
one's power of control over; to pass over into the control of

PLATT V. UNION PAciCIC

R.1. Co.

[Sup. Ct.

some one else; to alienate; to bestow; to part with; to get
rid of." Worcester's is, "p ut out of possession of."
Every one of these definitions points to a transfer of title and
ownership as the essential signification of the word. Its usual
technical meaning is "to sell." A general devise with power
to dispose of carries the fee. 2 Redf. Wills, 334, note. A
devise with power of disposition gives power to convey the
fee. Lyon v. Harsh, 116 Mass. 232; Ellston v. Schilling, 42
N. Y. 79.
It was not the effect nor the intent of the indenture to transfer the title or the ownership of the lands. Its effect must
be determined by the law of the State where the lands are
situated (United States v. Crosby, 7 Cranch, 115; Clark v.
Graham, 6 Wheat. 577; McGoon v. Scales, 9 Wall. 23); and
in deciding upon it this court conforms to the decisions of the
State court. Hinde v. Fattier, 5 Pet. 398.
The statutes of Nebraska enact that "in the absence of stipulations to the contrary the mortgagor of real estate retains
the legal title and right of possession thereof" (Gen. Stat.
1873, sect. 55, p. 881); and not only her courts, but those of
the respective States where the granted lands lie, hold that a
mortgage conveys no title or right of possession. It merely
creates a lien to be enforced by action. Kyger v. Byley,
2 Neb. 20; Chick v. Willetts, 2 Kan. 384; Waterson v. Devoe,
18 id. 223; Drace v. Boot, 2 Col. 685; Tyman v. Kelly,
1 Nev. 179; Johnson v. Sherman, 15 Cal. 287; Goodnow v.
.Ewer, 16 id. 461; Dutton v. TWarschauer, 21 id. 609.
The indenture, so far from stipulating that the legal title
and right of possession shall not remain in the company, provides that the latter shall have the exclusive control of the
lands, and full power and authority to make contracts for the
sale of them at such prices as it and the trustees may agree
upon. It thus appears that nothing but a lien on the lands
was created, which is not a jus ad reem, but simply a charge
upon them, binding them with no greater force and effect than
an ordinary judgment, or an assessment against them for taxes.
The company concedes the non-transfer of them. It alleges,
in the action of ejectment, that it is the owner, seised in fee
of the tract in question and entitled to the possession thereof.

In ascertaining the meaning of the act subjecting the lands to
pre-emption, on the failure of the company to sell or dispose of
them within a specific period, we may recur to the history of
the times, to the surrounding circumstances, the preceding legislation touching the public domain, and to the apprehended
mischief which Congress sought to avert. Rhode Island v.
Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 723; Maryland v. Bailroad Company, 22 Wall. 105; United States v. Union Pacific Railroad
Co,, 91 U. S. 72.
These have been considered by this court in Railway Company v. Prescott,16 Wall. 609, and the case shows that the
construction for which the company now contends would, if
practically carried out, defeat the settled policy of the government, and exclude from pre-emption an immense body of
lands, the settlement of which Congress designed to facilitate
and expedite.
If creating the lien on the lands is disposing of them, then
the company has complied with the requirement of Congress.
The extinguishment of the lien by the payment of the debt
would not render them subject to settlement under the preemption laws.
Counsel may insist that our construction does not give effect
The word does not necessarily imply that the terms
to "or."
between which it is found are alternatives. Worcester remarks
that there is no word in the language of more equivocal import.
It is often used to connect equivalent expressions. Such is the
case here.
The indenture, by providing that the provisions of the act
in all that concerns the sale and disposal of the land shall be
deemed and taken as a part of the instrument, stipulates, if
our construction be correct, that the lands shall, at a given
time, be subject to pre-emption at $1.25 per acre. This can
work no hardship as the avails of the sales would be paid to
the company, and the holders of the bonds purchased them
with knowledge of the conditions of the grant.
Platt has met the requirements of the pre-emption laws,
and has a complete equitable right to the land. .risbie v.
Whitney, 9 Wall. 187; Hutchings v. Low, 15 id. 77; Shepley

530. He is, therefore, entitled to relief. The failure of the
company to sell within the appointed time vested the legal
title to the lands in the United States, or if this court holds
that such title still abides in the company, then the latter
holds it as the trustee of parties entitled to pre-emption under
the acts of Congress, and those acts can be executed only by
the officers of the government.
Mifr. Sidney Bartlett and Hr. Samuel Shellabarger,contra.
Mn. JUsTICE STR ONG delivered the opinion of the court.

If it be conceded that the complainant has complied with all
the conditions prescribed by the acts of Congress for the acquisition by a pre-emptioner of an equitable title to a portion of
the public lands, the question still remains, whether the land
which he claims was open to pre-emption when his settlement
was made. It is confessedly a part of the lands which the
United States granted to the Union Pacific Railroad Company
by the act of July 1, 1862. 12 Stat. 489.
The third section 3 of the act contains words of present grant,
but the fourth section enacted that on the completion of each
successive forty miles of the railroad and telegraph line, patents
should be issued, "conveying the right and title to said lands
to said company, on each side of the road, as far as the same is
completed, to the amount aforesaid." The seventh section
required the road and telegraph to be completed before the
first day of July, 1874. The amending act of July 2, 1864
(13 Stat. 356), enlarged the grant, but made no change in its
terms; and the Secretary of the Interior, as directed by the act,
withdrew the lands within fifteen miles of the designated route
of the road from pre-emption, private entry, and sale.
Such was the grant. The railroad and telegraph line were
entirely completed before July 1, 1874 (if not in 1869), and
patents for all the lands granted were directed to be issued to
the company in November of that year. By force of the grant,
however, and by the definite fixing of the route of the road,
and the filing the map thereof in the Interior Department, as
required by law, together with the completion of the road westward and beyond the tract claimed by the complainant, the
1 Supra, p. 49.

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co.

title to that tract had become vested in the company before
April 16, 1867. On that day the company, for the purpose of
raising money necessary to continue and complete the construction of their road, issued their coupon bonds for the sum
in the aggregate of $10,400,000, bearing seven per cent interest,
and payable in twenty years from their date. On the same
day, for the purpose of securing the payment of the bonds, the
company executed a mortgage or deed of trust to trustees of
all and several the several sections of land granted to them by
the said acts of Congress, including the tract claimed by the
complainant. The instrument, we think, though in form a
deed of trust, was substantially a mortgage. It was delivered
to the trustees, and duly recorded. The bonds were sold in
different markets to bona fide purchasers, and they are now
outstanding, about $7,000,000 still remaining unsatisfied. All
this was before the entire road was completed, and before the
first step was taken by the complainant to obtain his pre-emption right.
In view of these facts, we are to determine whether the mortgage was a disposition of the lands granted to the company
within the meaning of the last clause of sect. 2 of the act of
1862. If it was, the tract of land claimed by the complainant was not open to settlement and pre-emption when he entered
thereon, nor has it been at any time since. That clause declared that "all the lands granted by the section, which shall
not be sold or disposed of by said company within three years
after the entire road shall have been completed, shall be subject
to settlement and pre-emption," &c. Was the mortgage a sale
or disposition of the lands as understood by Congress? That
the company had power to mortgage the lands admits of no
reasonable doubt. It may be conceded that a railroad company
has not power either to sell or mortgage its franchise, -or perhaps the road which it has been chartered to build, without
express legislative authority, and this has in some cases been
decided. The reason is that such a sale or mortgage tends to
defeat the purposes the legislature had in view in the grant of
the charter. The adventurers who obtain the charter and who
accept it undertake to construct and maintain the public work.
Their undertaking is the consideration of the grant, and with-

PLATT V. UNION PACIFI

R.R. Co.

[Sup. Ot.

out legislative consent they cannot throw off the obligation
they have assumed. But the reason is inapplicable to a sale or
mortgage of property which is not a part of the road and in no
way connected with its use. Parting with such property or
incumbering it in no degree interferes with the performance of
the duties of the company to the public. Railroad companies
are not usually empowered to hold lands other than those
needed for roadway and stations, or water privileges. But
when they are authorized to acquire and hold lands separate
from their roads, the authority must include the ordinary incidents of ownership,- the right to sell or to mortgage. Especially is this so when, as in the present case, the lands have
been granted to the company by the legislature that granted
the charter, without any restriction of their use.
Assuming, therefore, as we must, and as has been tacitly
conceded in the argument, that the company had the power to
make the mortgage of 1867, we need not stop to inquire whether
it was a sale or a partial sale. In some of the States, as well
as in England, a mortgage is practically, as well as in form, a
sale. It passes the legal title to the mortgagee. The more
general modern doctrine in this country is, we admit, that it
creates merely a lien, without any transmission of title. But
if not a sale, was the mortgage made by the company defendant
in this case not a disposition of the lands granted to it by Congress? This question is not to be answered by reference to
definitions given in the dictionaries. What did Congress mean
in the act of 1862 ? That something else than sale, either total
or partial, was intended we are required by all the rules of construction to conclude. Congress is not to be presumed to have
used words for no purpose. If it was intended that only lands
which had been sold before three years had expired after the
entire completion of the railroad should be exempted from preemption, the words "or disposed of" were entirely superfluous.
But the admitted rules of statutory construction declare that
a legislature is presumed to have used no superfluous words.
Courts are to accord a meaning, if possible, to every word in a
statute. In Commonwealth v. Alger (7 Cush. (Mass.) 5a-89),
it was said that in putting a construction upon any statute
every part must be regarded, and it must be so expounded, if

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC R.R. Co.

practicable, as to give some effect to every part of it. So, in
-Peoplev. Burns (5 Mich. 114), it was held that some meaning,
if possible, must be given to every word in a statute, and that
where a given construction would make a word redundant, it
-was reason for rejecting it. To the same effect is Dearborn and
Others v. Inhabitantsof Brookline (97 Mass. 466) ; and in Gates
v. Salmon (35 Cal. 576) it was ruled that no words are to be
treated as surplusage or as repetition. The phrase "or disposed
of" must, therefore, have some distinctive meaning, some meaning beyond the word "sold." What that is may be seen very
plainly when the whole act of 1862 is examined. We are
seeking for the intention of Congress, and to discover that we
may look at the paramount object which Congress had in view,
as well as the means by which it proposed to accomplish that
object. Congress addressed itself to the work of securing a
railroad from the Missouri River to the western boundary of
the Territory of Nevada, and thence to the Pacific Ocean. The
work was vast, beyond the reach of private capital or enterprise. It could be accomplished only by the bestowal upon a
corporation of very large governmental aid. The proposed
road ran over mountains and through what was known to be
an uninhabited desert, for more than a thousand miles. The
lands through which it must pass were supposed to be almost
worthless, and quite unsalable, until they should be made, by
the construction of a railroad, accessible to settlers and to Eastern markets. The construction of a railroad through such a
region was most uninviting to private capitalists. To induce
them to embark in the enterprise was the overshadowing motive
that dictated the act of 1862. This is apparent in almost every
line of the act. For this reason the grants of land were made,
the rights of way and of taking materials were given, and the
subsidy bonds were loaned, to be repaid only at the expiration
of thirty years, with interest payable only at the expiration of
that period. Even this was not enough. No association and
no persons were found willing, with all this proffered assistance,
to undertake the construction of the road. But so earnest was
Congress to induce the corporators to attempt the work, that
in 1864 additional aid was proffered, the grant of lands was
doubled, and new privileges were conferred. We do not now

60

PLATT V. UNION PAOIFIC R.R. Co.

[Sup. Ct.

attempt to portray the earnestness - tbe all-absorbing earnestness - with which Congress sought to secure the construction
of the road by private enterprise. It was well exhibited in
United States v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. (91 U. S. 72), to
which we refer. Suffice it to say, the purpose of Congress, above
all others, was to obtain the construction of the railroad by the
corporation it created to undertake the work. For that alone
the subsidy bonds were given. Only for that the grants of
land were made. All was intended to give the utmost possible
assistance to the stupendous and unparalleled enterprise. We
do not say that other incidental considerations were not kept
in mind, but what we do assert as plainly manifest in the legislation is, that the paramount intention of Congress was to give
such assistance to the company as to induce them to build the
road. Every other consideration was subordinate to that.
All will concede that in construing the act of 1862 we are to
look at the state of things then existing, and in the light then
appearing seek for the purposes and objects of Congress in using
the language it did. And we are to give such construction to
that language, if possible, as will carry out the congressional
intentions. For what particular purpose, then, was the grant of
lands made? The statute itself answers, "for the purpose of
aiding in the construction of the railroad and telegraph line,"
and securing governmental transportation, &c. The lands were
granted to be used in furtherance of such construction. But Congress and the grantees must have known that, when granted,
the lands were of little worth. They were then unsalable at
any price. Their value was wholly prospective, dependent upon
the construction of the road. Purchasers could not have been
reasonably expected, certainly few, for immediate settlement.
The obvious mode, therefore, of using the lands for the construction of the road (not for paying debts incurred in the construction, but for immediate need as the construction was progressing)
was to hypothecate them as security for a loan. Many persons
might be willing to advance money on the faith of the prospective value of the lands, if the railroad was built, who would not
be willing to buy when it was doubtful whether the company
would ever be able to raise the money necessary to build the
road and thus render the lands salable. Congress must have

Oct. 1878.]

PLATT V. UNION PACIFIC

R.R. Co.

61

been blind, indeed, if it did not foresee this, and intend to
authorize the use of the lands to raise money by mortgage for
tlhe object it had so much at heart. This, we think, was what
was intended by the phrase "or disposed of," as distinguished
from " sold." Some of the lands might be sold as the work
was progressing, and others could be used in aid of the construction only by pledging them to persons who might be willing to
advance money on the faith of their prospective value. But
whether sold or used as a security for money loaned to advance
the construction of the road, they were equally employed for
the purpose for which they were granted. The words "disposed of" are undeniably apt words to indicate a transfer by
mortgage. If land be conveyed to A. to enable him to raise
money for a particular purpose, nobody would doubt that a
mortgage would be a disposition of the land for that purpose;
and the grant made by the third section of the act of 1862 was
obviously made, as we have suggested, with the intent of giving present assistance to the company in the construction of
the road. It was not intended to be available only after the
company had raised all the money necessary for the work.
Then the time of need for the purpose mentioned would have
gone by. The act declares it to have been "to aid in the construction of the road," not to reimburse expenditures made in
the construction. Hence it must have been intended that the
company might use or dispose of the land in some other way
than by a sale. But in what other way? Not by gift; for that
would not have been in aid of the construction, and the grant
was intended for that. Nor by leases. They could have
brought little money. And no other mode of disposition except by mortgage has been suggested which could furnish the
requisite aid for building the road. No other is conceivable.
The conclusion would seem, therefore, to be almost inevitable,
that Congress, when speaking of a disposition of the lands
other than a sale, contemplated making them available for
the purposes of the grant by mortgage.
And if so, it is hard to believe that only a limited interest in
the lands was allowed to be hypothecated. Twelve years were
designated as the period within which the road was required to
be completed, and lands not sold or disposed of within three

years thereafter were to be open to pre-emption. Mforeover,
under the provisions of the act, the title to the lands could be
perfected in the company only as the work of construction
advanced; that is, as each section of forty miles was completed. The company might not become entitled to some
until July 1, 1874. If, therefore, a mortgage could only bind
the lands unsold until the expiration of three years after that
date, it would have been an hypothecation for a term of years,
and as to some of the lands, for a term of only three years.
Was that the aid proffered by Congress to stimulate and render possible the completion of an enterprise in which it felt so
deep an interest? If so, it was a barren gift. Looking at the
character of the lands and their remoteness from settlements,
it must have been evident enough that money could not have
been raised on the credit of such a mortgage. The power of
disposition given for the express purpose of enabling the company to raise money for the construction of the road, by such
an interpretation of the act is made of no value. The interpretation, therefore, defeats the manifest intention of Congress,
and for that reason it cannot be accepted.
If it be suggested, as it has been on behalf of the complainant, that the mortgage contains a provision that has some bearing upon the extent of its lien, it may be well here to notice
that provision. The instrument purports to convey to the
trustees a fee, and not a limited estate, and it requires in all
sales that may be made under it the conveyance of a fee. It
contains, however, the following clause: "It is hereby declared
by the parties to this indenture that all the provisions of the
said acts of Congress [referring to the acts of 1862 and 1864],
so far as they are applicable, are hereby made and shall be
deemed and taken to be a part of this instrument, and the said
provisions in all that concerns the sale and disposal of the said
lands hereby conveyed to the parties of the second part are
to be observed and strictly and faithfully carried out and fulfilled."
What are thus stipulated to be observed and strictly and faithfully to be carried out and fulfilled are the provisions of the acts
in all that concerns the sale and disposal of the lands. They
are matters to be carried out and strictly fulfilled, -duties

to be performed by the company, and duties which concern the
sale or disposal of the lands. Carrying out and performing a
provision implies action, and the provision must, therefore, be
one relating to action. But the acts of Congress contain no
provision respecting the sale or disposal of the lands that requires action, that is, something to be carried out and fulfilled,
except the implied duty of devoting the proceeds of sales or
dispositions strictly and faithfully to aid in the construction of
the road.
The provision that at the expiration of three years from the
completion of the road the unsold or undisposed-of lands should
be open to pre-emption, was in its nature not one to be "strictly
and faithfully carried out and fulfilled " by the company. The
right to pre-emption of. whatever might be left for pre-emption
was a matter with which the company had nothing to do, - in
relation to which they had no duties to perform, and only a
right to the price paid by the pre-emptor. The clause of the
mortgage referred to seems, therefore, to have been intended
only as a stipulation on the part of the company that whatever
money was raised on the mortgage should be strictly and faithfully applied in furtherance of the purpose for which the grant
of the lands was made; namely, to aid in the construction of
the railroad. Thus understod, it was a valuable stipulation for
the mortgagees. It added to their security; for the value of the
lands depended principally upon the application by the company of all its means to the completion of the work.
On the other hand, if an hypothecation of the lands in fee
was within the power to "dispose of" them, as we have endeavored to show, and if the granting part of the mortgage
made, standing by itself, did hypothecate a fee, it is hard to
believe the parties intended by the stipulations referred to to
restrict the exercise of the power to the grant of an estate for
years, a limitation alike injurious to the mortgagors and the
mortgagees. We think, therefore, nothing in the stipulation
is repugnant to the granting part of the mortgage which purported an hypothecation of the entire fee.
There is always a tendency to construe statutes in the light
in which they appear when the construction is given. It is
easy to be wise after we see the results of experience. We

[Sup. Ct.

may now think it quite possible the lands could all have been
sold before July 1, 1877. The unforeseen success of the enterprise and the unprecedented rush of emigration along the line
of the railroad have shed new light upon the value of the
grants made to the company. But in endeavoring to ascertain
what the Congress of 1862 intended, we must, as far as possible, place ourselves in the light that Congress enjoyed, look at
things as they appeared to it, and discover its purpose from the
language used in connection with the attending circumstances.
Guided by this rule of construction, as well as by others universally recognized, we have been led unhesitatingly to the
conclusion that the deed of trust or mortgage executed by this
company in 1867 was a disposition of the lands granted by the
third section of the act of 1862, within the meaning of that
act.
We do not say that any mortgage, however small, or manifestly made to evade a bona fide execution of the purposes for
which the grants were made, or made to defeat the policy of
the government which encourages the sale of public lands to
private settlers, and guards against the accumulation of large
bodies in single hands, would be a disposal as understood by
Congress. It may be conceded it would not be, for it would
be in conflict with the avowed object of the grant. The present
is no such case. By the pleadings it appears that the mortgage
of 1867 was made "for the purpose of raising money necessary
to continue and complete the construction of the railroad, in
accordance with the act of Congress." Nor are we now called
upon to decide whether the lands covered by the mortgage
will not be open for pre-emption, if they shall remain unsold
after the mortgage shall be extinguished. That question is not
now before us.
The principal objection urged against the interpretation we
have given to the words "sold or disposed of" is, that it is
repugnant to the governmental policy of guarding against
monopolies of public lands by large corporations or single individuals. It must be admitted that Congress had that policy in
view when it declared that the lands not sold or disposed of
within three years after the entire road should be completed
should be subject to settlement and pre-emption, at a price not

exceeding $1.25 per acre. But this policy was manifestly subordinated to the higher object of having the road constructed,
and constructed with the aid of the land grant. No limitation
was set to the quantity of land which the company might sell
to single associations, or single persons. It was left at liberty
to sell, if it could, to any land association or private purchaser,
the entire body of the lands or any lesser quantity, regardless
of the general legislative policy. It was allowed to sell or dispose of the grant at its pleasure, for the purpose of raising
money to aid in the road construction, provided thus raising
the money was done within the limited period. With that
power no pre-emptor was authorized to interfere. Whatever
contingent rights he had were postponed and subordinated
to it. If, as we think it manifest, the leading primary policy
of the act was to place the lands in the hands of the company,
to be used for the completion of the road, as this work progressed, any secondary policy the government may also have
had in view ought not to be allowed to embarrass or defeat
that which was primary. It is evident Congress thought there
might be remnants of the grant, not used in aid of the construction of the road, either because other resources of the company
might prove sufficient, or because it might be found impossible
to dispose of them in time to furnish such aid, and those remnants it undertook to open to settlement and pre-emption.
This appears to us to have been what was intended, and all
that was intended. The construction gives full effect alike to
the paramount and the subordinate purposes of the act. Each
has its own field of operation. The construction contended
for by the appellant restricts the power of disposition, denies
the authority of the company to utilize, except partially, for the
purposes of the grant, the land granted, and might have impaired and possibly defeated the leading purpose of the grant.
It subjects the paramount to the subordinate, and postpones the
primary object to the secondary. On the other hand, utilizing
the lands, by raising money upon them through a mortgage,
or, in other words, disposing of them by mortgage, did not
defeat the policy of opening the remnants not used to preemption.
Thus construing the last clause of the third section of the

act, in connection with all the other provisions made by Congress, endeavoring to give effect to every part, and regarding
the spirit as well as the letter, we are constrained to hold that
the mortgage of 1867 was a disposition of the lands mortgaged
within the meaning of the statute, and, consequently, that the
tract of land claimed by the complainant was not open to preemption when he undertook to pre-empt it. He has, therefore,
no equitable title to it.
-Decreeaffirmed.
BRADLEY, with whom concurred AIR. JUSTICE
and MR. JusTcE MIILLER, dissenting.
I dissent from the judgment of the court in this case. In
the third section of the original charter, after granting to the
company five alternate sections of public land on each side of
its line of railroad, to aid in the construction thereof, it was
provided that all lands so granted, which should not be sold or
disposed of by the company within three years after the entire
road should have been completed, should be subject to settlement and pre-emption, like other lands, at a price not exceeding $1.25 per acre, to be paid to the company. The appellant,
after the three years had expired, settled upon the land in
question and claimed pre-emption of the same; and offered to
the company the price specified in the statute. The latter refused to receive the money or to recognize his right, alleging
that it had disposed of the lands in 1867 by executing a mortgage for its entire land grant to secure a loan of $7,000,000.
The question is, whether such mortgage is a sale or disposition of the lands within the meaning of the proviso of the
third section. I think it is not. In my judgment, Congress
had in view such a sale and disposition of the lands as would
secure a settlement thereof. The object was to encourage a
speedy settlement of the country along the line of the road;
and hence it was provided, if the company did not so dispose
of them, they should be open to settlers, at the usual prices,
reserving to the company, however, the right to receive the
purchase-money for the same. If the company, by one sweeping deed of trust, or mortgage, could cover the whole domain
as with a blanket, and thus prevent a settlement thereon until

the lands, by advance of prices, would be out of the reach of
actual settlers desirous of occupying and improving them, it
seems to 'me it would entirely defeat the objects of the act.
It is said, however, that if the company could not mortgage
the lands they could not make use of them in aid of the construction of the road, the purpose for which they were expressly granted. I do not think this result would by any
means follow. The fourth section provides for granting to the
company patents for a proportionate part of the lands, for
every forty miles of railroad which should be completed. As
fast, therefore, as the successive forty-mile sections should be
completed, it was contemplated by the act that the company
should have control of the lands to that extent. This would
constantly subject to their use large tracts, which, if disposed
of, according to the intent of Congress, would have effected a
rapid settlement of the adjacent country in all portions of the
route which were adapted to cultivation.
The criticism that the words "sold or disposed of" mean
something more than "sold," and can only mean a mortgage
of the lands, I do not conceive to be just, but rather as sticking
in the bark. Reading the whole act together, I think the only
fair construction is that which is above suggested.
The objectiqn that the right of pre-emption contended for
would have prevented the company from giving a mortgage at
all is not tenable. The mortgagees take the mortgage subject
to the provisions of the act. It contains a proviso to this express effect. The lands were mortgaged cum onere, and the
mortgagees, if so stipulated, would be entitled to the purchasemoney receivable from settlers. This view of the subject
would effectuate justice between all the parties, preserve the
true construction of the act, and carry out the policy of
Congress.
In view of these considerations, I think that the decree
should be reversed, and that the appellant, the complainant
below, should be declared to be equitably entitled to the land
in question.
