which he cannot be required to make. As well might he be
decreed to satisfy the appellant's demand by money, as by the
service sought to be enforced. Both belong to the lien-holders,
and neither can thus be diverted.
The appellant can, therefore, have no locus standi in a court
of equity.
Both these objections appear by its own showing. It was,
therefore, competent and proper for the court below, sua sponte,
to dismiss the bill for the want of equity upon its face. Brown

GODDEN V. KMIDELL.
In cases of concurrent jurisdiction, courts of equity consider themselves bound
by the statutes of limitation which govern courts of law ; in many other cases
they act upon the analogy of the limitations at law; but even where there
is no such statute governing the case, a defence founded upon the lapse of
time and the staleness of the claim is available in equity where there has
been gross laches in prosecuting the claim, or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights.

from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
*The case was argued by Mr. James i. Johnstonand Mr. John
Scott for the appellant, and by JRKr. Calderon Carlisle and Mr.
George T. Appleby for the appellee.
APPEAL

MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Statutes of limitation form part of the legislation of every
government, and are everywhere regarded as conducive and
even necessary to the peace and repose of society. When they
are addressed to courts of equity as well as to courts of law, as
they seem to be in controversies of concurrent jurisdiction, they
are equally obligatory in both forums as a means of promoting
uniformity of decision.
Stale claims are never favored in equity, and where gross laches
is shown and unexplained acquiescence in the operation of an
adverse right, courts of equity frequently treat the lapse of time,

[Sup. Ct.

even for a shorter period than the one specified in the Statute
of Limitations, as a presumptive bar to the claim. Stearns v.
Page, 7 How. 819; Badger v. Badger, 2 Cliff. 154.
Time, it is said, is no bar to an established trust, which may
be true in cases of concealed fraud, provided the injured party
is not guilty of undue laches subsequent to its discovery. Circumstances of the kind form an exception to the rule; but the
rule still is, that when a party has been guilty of such laches in
prosecuting his equitable remedy as would bar him if his title
was solely at law, he will be barred in equity, from a wise consideration of the paramount importance of quieting titles.
lichaud v. Girod, 4 How. 561.
It appears that the complainants are, or claim to be, creditors
of Edwin Walker, deceased, and that they instituted the present suit in behalf of themselves and other creditors of the deceased to recover a moiety of certain real and personal property,
together with the rents aid profits of the same, which, as they
allege, belonged to their creditor in his lifetime and at the time
of his decease. They allege that their creditor owned and held
the property described in the bill of complaint in common with
one Abram F. Kimmell, of the city of Washington, since deceased, with whom he was carrying on the livery-stable business, under the firm name of Walker & Kimmell, the said
property being used for the purposes of said business; that the
said Walker being largely indebted to the complainants, their
testators and intestates, as well as other parties, dissolved partnership with said Kimmel and conveyed all his real and personal estate, after payment of all partnership debts, to one
Voltaire Willett, by deed dated Oct. 8, 1857, in trust to pay
off the complainants, their testators and intestates, with the
proceeds thereof, the remainder to be paid over to the grantor,
hig heirs and assigns. Possession of the property at the time
was in the junior partner; and the complainants allege that he
continued in the possession thereof up to the day of his death,
holding the same and applying the proceeds thereof to his own
use, without accounting for the rents and profits, either to the
grantor, the trustee, or to the creditors, and that since his death
the property has been in the possession of his widow and children, who have appropriated the same to their own use, and that

Oct. 1878.]

GODDEN V. KIMMIELL.

they utterly deny all right of the complainants to any part or
interest in the same.
Sufficient appears from the preceding statement to show what
the circumstances were on the first day of February, 1871, when
the present bill of complaint was filed against the respondents
in the subordinate court. They are Mary A. Kimmell, administratrix of Abram F. Kimmell, deceased, his four children, the
heirs of the deceased trustee, and the administrator of the deceased senior partner, who, as alleged, was the debtor of the
complainants.
Service was made; and the respondents appeared and filed
answers, setting up several defences, the most material of which
are contained in the answer of the widow and children of the
deceased junior partner. They deny all the material allegations of the bill of complaint, to the effect following: 1. That the complainants or either of them are creditors of
the deceased senior partner of the firm, or that the senior
partner of the firm was ever the owner of the real estate
described in the bill of complaint, or that he 'ever owned or
possessed. any personal property, or that the deceased junior
partner ever had in his possession any personal property which
belonged either to the deceased senior partner or to the firm.
2. They admit the death of the trustee, but they aver that
they are not informed and cannot state whether he ever did
any thing in discharge of the trusts created by the said deed,
and they also admit that the trustee and the deceased junior
partner made the alleged conveyance to the brother-in-law of
the latter, but they aver that it was made in good faith, and
that the moiety of the consideration belonging to the senior
partner was appropriated to pay his just debt, as fully explained
in the answer.
3. They also allege as a defence that the debtor of the complainants left Washington in the year 1846 ; that he went to
Richmond and entered into business there with a new partner;
that he there contracted large debts for which he was liable;
that in the latter Part of 1857 he conveyed to his new partner
a large amount of real and personal property to pay all his
debts, including those set up by the complainants; that all these
claims were fully satisfied and extinguished either by payment

GODDEN V.

IhMMELL.

[Sup. Ct.

in money or by the acceptance of other securities; and that the
supposed debtor of the complainants, at the time of the dissolution of the partnership here, before he went to Richmond,
relinquished all interest in the future earnings of the concern,
and that the partnership as between the parties was dissolved,
though they admit that no formal notice of the dissolution was
published.
4. They also admit that besides the real estate there was at
the time on hand a large stock of horses, vehicles, and other
property, all of which was taken by the junior partner; but
they aver that the junior partner from time to time made payments and advances to the retired partner exceeding in amount
the value of his interest in the assets of the partnership, as estimated by himself ; and they aver that no formal settlement of
accounts ever took place, but they allege that if one could be
made, which, as they state, it would be difficult and expensive
to accomplish, it would be found that the estate of the debtor
of the complainants is largely indebted to the estate of the
junior partner.
Finally, they set up as defence to the suit that the claims
are stale demands, and of a character that courts of equity will
not countenance, because, as they allege, it would now be inequitable and unjust that the complainants should be permitted
to enforce an account from the respondents, after having slept
upon their rights, if any they have, for so long a time and until
all the parties to the transaction are dead.
By consent the cause was referred to an auditor, with instructions to ascertain and report what amount, if any, was due to
the respective complainants, and to ascertain and state the
partnership accounts and the character of the partnership property at the date of the trust-deed, and the disposition made of
the rents and profits by the respondents. Hearing was had
beforq the auditor, and he made the report set forth in the
transcript.
Testimony was taken by the complainants prior to the order
of reference, and they took further testimony before the examiner subsequent to the appointment of the auditor. By his
report it appears that two schedules were attached to the deed
of trust, one of which purported to be a list of drafts, notes, and

Oct. 1878.]

GODDEN V. KIMMELL.

bonds due to a third person, and the other to be a list of debts
due by the debtor to the complainants. Among other things,
the deed recited that the said debtor, independently of his indebtedness to the firm of which he was a member, owed a large
amount to the persons named in the two schedules, and that he
desired, after paying all the firm debts, to secure pro rata the
debts in the first schedule, and if sufficient was left after that,
to pay in full the debts in the second schedule.
It appears that the deed was duly executed, and that the
grantor conveyed to the trustee, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns for ever, all of his right, title, and interest
in and to the real and personal property, debts, effects, credits,
and assets of every kind whatever and in any manner belonging
to the firm, subject to the debts and liabilities of the firm and
to the right of the junior partner in winding up and paying off
the same, the true intent and meaning of the instrument being
only to convey the interest of the senior partner after all the
liabilities of the firm have been discharged. Matters of the
kind being fully explained, the auditor proceeds to report that
he has not stated the claims of the respective complainants; and
he gives the reasons for the omission, which appear to be satisfactory, as the report shows that the complainants did not furnish the means to enable him to comply with that direction,
except perhaps in the single instance fully set forth in the
report.
Directions were also given by the decretal order that the
auditor should state the partnership accounts, which he also
failed to do, for the satisfactory reason, as he states, that no
testimony or other material was furnished by the parties to
enable him to perform the required service. Another direction of the decretal order was to state the amount of the property belonging to the firm at the date of the trust-deed. For
a compliance with that order, so far as the real estate is concerned, the auditor refers to the deeds introduced in evidence
before the examiner, and in respect to the personal property
he states that there was no evidence given to show what, if
any, belonged to the partnership at that date.
Lots numbered 16, 17, and the west. half of 18, in the square
numbered 491, were included in the trust-deed. On the 16th

GODDEN V. KIMMELL.

[Sup. Ct.

of November, 1858, the junior partner and his wife, the trustee
of the senior partner joining with them, conveyed the west
half of lot 18 and part of lot 17 to the trustee of the sister-inlaw of the first-named grantor, in respect to which the auditor
reports that the deed conveying the same refers to the prior
deed of trust given by the senior partner, and he states that
the recitals of the deed specify the purpose for which it was
executed, and show that the firm owed the cestui que trust the
sum of $2,000 money loaned, and that the property was conveyed to her for the sum of $5,000, one-half of which went to
pay that debt and interest, and the other moiety was paid or
secured to the junior partner of the firm.
Six years later the grantee in the deed reconveyed the same
to her brother-in-law for five dollars, as expressed in the consideration of the deed. Complainants charge in the bill of
complaint that the junior partner fraudulently procured the
conveyance to be made in order to secure the title to himself;
but the respondents in 'their answer deny all fraud and bad
faith in the premises, and the auditor reports that no testimony
was given touching the conveyance. Instead of that, he states,
in response to that charge, that while the circumstances attending the conveyance may be well calculated to cast suspicion
upon it, he finds nothing in the case to warrant him in pronouncing it fraudulent and void.
Where the answer of the respondent is responsive to the
bill it is evidence in his favor, and is conclusive, unless disproved by more than one witness. Story, Eq. Plead. (7th ed.),
sect. 875 a; Daniel v. Mitchel, 1 Story, 188.
Two witnesses, or one witness with confirmatory circumstances, are required to outweigh an answer asserting a fact
responsive to the bill, the reason for the rule being that when
the complainant calls upon the respondent to answer an allegation he admits the answer, if duly filed, to be evidence, and
if it is testimony, it is equal to the testimony of any other
witness; and as the complainant cannot prevail nmless the
balance of proof is in his favor, he must have circumstances
in addition to his single witness, else he fails to establish the
affirmative of the issue. Clark's "Jxrecutorsv. Van Beimsdyk,
9 Cranch, 153; Hughes v. Blake, 6 Wheat. 453.

GODDEN V. KIMfELL.

Chancery courts invariably hold, where the answer is responsive to the bill and positively denies the matters charged,
and the denial has respect to a transaction within the knowledge of the respondent, the answer is evidence in his favor;
and unless it is overcome by the testimony of two credible
witnesses, or of one witness corroborated by other facts and
circumstances which give it greater weight than the answer,
it is conclusive, so that the court will neither make a decree
nor send the case to trial, but will simply dismiss the bill.
Badger v. Badger, supra.
Only one witness was examined before the auditor as to
the rents and profits received by the respondents, and the
report of the auditor states that the annual rental value of
the property, excluding that charged to have been firaudulently conveyed, was only $938, and if that be excluded, then
the real estate consists only of lot 16 in square 491, with the
improvements.
Ten exceptions to the auditor's report were filed by the
complainants, alleging for error that he did not report their
respective claims as liens against the property in controversy.
Pursuant to the order of the court the parties were heard upon
the auditor's report and the exceptions thereto, and the court
entered a decree that the bill of complaint be dismissed, from
which decree the complainants appealed to the general term,
where the decree of the subordinate court was affirmed.
Proceedings in the court below being ended, the complainants appealed to this court, and filed the following assignment
of errors: 1. That the court erred in not entering a decree
cancelling and setting aside as fraudulent the said conveyance
to the sister-in-law of the junior partner. 2. That the court
erred in not entering a decree that the real estate transferred
to the trustee of their debtor should be sold and distributed
to his creditors. 3. That the court erred in not entering a
decree that the administratrix of the junior partner should
account and pay to the trustee to be duly appointed so much
of the personal assets of the firm included in the trust-deed
as were held by her intestate in his lifetime. 4. That the
court erred in dismissing the bill of complaint. 5. That
the court erred in not entering a decree that the representa-

GODDEN V. KIMMELL.

[Sup. Ct.

tives of the deceased junior partner should account for the
rents and profits of the real estate conveyed to the trustee up
to the date of the decree in this cause.
That the partnership existed is not denied; and the proof
is clear that the senior partner left Washington in 1846, and
that he went to Richmond and there formed a new partnership, and engaged largely in business for twenty years before
his death. As before remarked, the right of the complainants,
if any, to prosecute the suit sprang from the trust-deed dated
Oct. 8, 1857, and executed by their alleged debtor to his trustee
.for the purpose of paying his debts, including what he owed to
the complainants. Annexed as the deed is to the bill of complaint, it may properly be referred to as an exhibit, from which
it appears that their debtor and the intestate of the first-named
respondent were "engaged as partners in the city of Washington, and in the progress of the business acquired real and
personal estate, including horses, carriages, buggies, sulkies,
and other property," and that they held claims against various
persons, and that the senior partner was independently indebted to the persons named in the schedules appended to
the deed; that he conveyed all his right, title, and interest in
the real and personal property, debts, effects, credits, and assets
of the firm to the grantee of the trust-deed for the described
purposes, subject to the debts and liabilities of the firm, and
the right of the junior partner in winding up and paying off
the same.
There is no averment in the bill that any interest in the
partnership property was ever collected by the trustee, or that
he could have made any such collection, nor is it averred that
any of the complainants are judgment creditors.
Fourteen years elapsed from the date of the deed to the
filing of the bill, and throughout that period none of the complainants during the lifetime of the partners and trustee or
any of them, took any step whatever to ascertain or enforce
their rights, if any they had, under that trust-deed. Nothing
appears to show that the trustee ever took any beneficial title
whatever to the real property. Beyond doubt, he took the
legal title by the words of the deed; but there is no proof
to show that he ever acquired the possession or the right of

Oct. 1878.]

GODDEN V. KIMMELL.

possession, it appearing by the deed that the right of possession was secured to the junior partner, for the purpose of
winding up the partnership.
Concede that the grantor might have joined the trustee in
a suit for an account on his own motion or at the suggestion
of the trustee or creditors, still the answer to that suggestion,
if made, is that he did not do so; and now the grantee, the
trustee, and the junior partner all being dead, unless there can
first be an account of the partnership property, the complainants can obtain no relief, as there is nothing on which a decree
in their favor could operate for their benefit. They do not
allege that there was ever any settlement of the partnership
affairs, nor do they in terms pray in the bill for an account of
the partnership assets. By consent an auditor was appointed
to ascertain and state the partnership accounts, but he characterizes the proceedings in the cause as involved in obscurity,
and the testimony "as incomplete, vague, and indefinite," and
reports that there is only one instance in which the amount
due to any one of the complainants has been proven with any
reasonable degree of certainty. Except the prayer that the
administratrix and heirs of the junior partner account with
and pay over to the complainants the rents and profits of the
estate conveyed to the trustee, the bill of complaint contains
nothing which can possibly be construed as a prayer for an
account of the assets of the partnership.
Four lots, to wit, 16, 17, 18, and 19, the complainants claim
were held and used as partnership property;- but the answer of
the principal respondents denies that claim, and avers that the
firm never owned any of the real estate mentioned, except lot
16 and parts of lots 17 and 18; and the auditor reports that,
excluding the property conveyed to the other trustee, the assets
consist only of lot 16 with the improvements on the same, and
that there is not a particle of testimony to prove that the conveyance to the other trustee was fraudulent. Attempt is made
to set aside that conveyance without making either the trustee
or cestui que trust parties to the bill, though it is said by the
complainants that they are both alive, of which, however, there
is no proof in the record.
Exceptions to the auditor's report were taken by the comVOL. Ix.

plainants because he did not report as liens against the property
described in the cause the claims of each and every complainant,
when his report shows that the evidence given did not enable
him, except in one instance, to ascertain the amount of the
claims, which was much less than the minimum of jurisdiction.
For fourteen years the complainants slept upon their rights,
and there is not a single allegation in the bill nor a particle of
proof introduced in their behalf to excuse their manifest laches
in not seeking an account until all the parties in interest have
departed this life.
Equity courts in cases of concurrent jurisdiction usually consider themselves bound by the Statute of Limitations which
govern courts of law in like cases, and this rather in obedience
to the Statute of Limitations than by analogy.
Wagner v.
Baird, 7 How. 234. In many other cases they act upon the
analogy of the statutory limitations at law, as where a legal
title would in ejectment be barred by twenty years' adverse
possession courts of equity will act upon the like limitation, and
apply it to all cases of relief sought upon equitable titles or
claims touching real estate. Moore v. Greene, 2 Curt. C. C.
202; 2 Story, Eq. Jur. (8th ed.) 520; _arnum v. Brooke,
9 Pick. (Mass.) 243.
Support to those propositions is found everywhere; but there
is a defence peculiar to courts of equity founded on lapse of
time and the staleness of the claim where no Statute of Limitations governs the case. Such courts in such cases often act
upon their own inherent doctrine of discouraging for the peace
of society antiquated demands by refusing to interfere where
there has been gross laches in prosecuting the claim, or long
acquiescence in the assertion of adverse rights. Badger v.
Badger, szmpra; Roberts v. Tanstall, 4 Hare, 269; Stearns v.
Page, supra.
Authorities to support that proposition are numerous and
decisive, nor is it necessary to look beyond the decisions of this
court for the purpose. Lapse of time, said Mr. Justice Thompson, and the death of the parties to the deed have always been
considered in a court of chancery entitled to great weight and
almost controlling circumstances in cases where the controversy
grows out of stale transactions. Jenkins v. Pye, 12 Pet. 241;

Oct. 1878.]

OODDEN

V. KIMMELL.

Beckford v. Wade, 17 Ves. 96; Humbert v. Rector, 7 Paige
(N. Y.), 193.
Few cases can be found more nearly analogous to the case
before the court than the one in which the controversy had its
origin in this district. It had respect to a deed of trust executed to secure certain creditors named in the schedule annexed
to the deed. Enough appears to show that the deed was filed
by the trustee himself within twenty years, and that the subordinate court decreed that the amount of debts enumerated in
the schedule should be paid. Appeal from that decree was
taken to this court, and Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in disposing
of the case and reversing the decree, remarked as follows:
" We do not found our judgment upon the presumption of payment. For it is not merely on the presumption of payment,
or in analogy to the Statute of Limitations, that a court of chancery refuses to lend its aid to stale demands. There must be
conscience, good faith, and reasonable diligence to call into
action the powers of the court. In matters of account, where
they are not barred by the Statute of Limitations, courts of
equity refuse to interfere after considerable lapse of time, from
considerations of public policy and from the difficulty of doing
entire justice when the original transactions have become obscured by time and the evidence may be lost." McKnight v.
Taylor, 1 How. 168.
Corresponding views were expressed by Mr. Justice Story
prior to tha'.time, and the Chief Justice referred to the same
as having settled the doctrine of the court upon the subject.
Piatt v. Vattier, 9 Pet. 416; Smith v. Clay, Amb. 645.
Courts of equity, acting on their own inherent doctrine of
discouraging for the peace of society antiquated demands, refuse
to interfere in attempts to establish a stale trust, except where
th6 trust is clearly established, or where the facts have been
fraudulently and successfully concealed by the trustee from the
knowledge of the cestui que trust. Relief in such cases may be
sought; but the rule is that the cestui que trust should set forth
in the bill specifically what were the impediments to an earlier
prosecution of the claim, and how he or she came to be so long
ignorant of their alleged rights, and the means used by the
respondent to keep him or her in ignorance, and how he or she

GODDEN V. KIDIMELL.

[Sup. Ct.

first came to the knowledge of their rights. Badger v. Badger,
2 Wall. 87; White v. Parnther,1 Knapp, C. C. 227.
When a party appeals to the conscience of the Chancellor in
support of a claim, says Mr. Justice Field, where there has
been laches in prosecuting it or long acquiescence in the assertion of adverse right, he should set forth in his bill specifically
what were the impediments to an earlier prosecution of the
claim; and if he does not, the Chancellor may justly refuse to
consider his case on his own showing, without inquiring whether
there is a demurrer or any formal plea of the Statute of Limitations contained in the answer. Marsh v. Whitmore, 21 Wall.
185.
Laches and neglect, says Mr. Justice Swayne, are invariably
discountenanced in equity, and therefore there has always been
a limitation of suits in such courts from the beginning of their
jurisdiction. Limitations of the kind are dictated by experience and are founded on a salutary policy, as the lapse of time
carries with it the memory and life of witnesses, the muniments
of evidence, and the other means of judicial proof. Brown v.
County of Buena Vista, 95 U. S. 161.
Difficulties often arise in controversies of the kind in getting
at the truth so as to administer justice with any thing like reasonable certainty. That the parties to the original transaction
have long since deceased is shown from the proofs in the case,
and it is not improbable that many or all of their clerks and
agents may be inaccessible as witnesses, for the same or some
other reason, or if alive and their attendance as witnesses may
be secured, they may not be able to remember any thing about
the transactions.
Viewed in the light of these authorities and suggestions, the
court is of the opinion that the last defence set up in the respondents' answer is fully maintained, and that there is no error
in the record.
Decree affirmed.
