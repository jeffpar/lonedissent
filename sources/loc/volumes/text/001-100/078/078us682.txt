LEGAL TENDER CASES.

IN these cases (Knox v. Lee and -Parkerv. Davis), two questions were some time since directed to be argued, namely:
1st. Is the act of Congress known as the Legal Tender Act
constitutional as to contracts made before its passage ? 2d.
Is it valid as applicable to transactions since its passage?
The questions were accordingly argued by Mr. Akerman,
Attorney-General, in the affirmative, and by Mr. Clarkson N.
.Potteron the other side; and, having been considered by THE
COURT, both were adjudged in the affirmative, and judgments entered accordingly.
The CHIEF JUSTICE, with Associate Justices NELSO-N, CLIFFORD, and FIELD, dissented from the majority
of the court, upon both propositions and the result, holding
that the act of Congress, so far as applicable to contracts
made before its passage, was repugnant to the Constitution
and void; and also, that it was repugnant to the Constitution and void, so far as applicable to contracts made since
its passage.
No opinion of the court nor any reasons for dissent were
now given. It was stated, however, that they would be read
hereafter, before the close of the term. The case, along
with a few others crowded for want of space from this
volume, will be reported in a subsequent one.
