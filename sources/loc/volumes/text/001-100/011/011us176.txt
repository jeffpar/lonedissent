cause.

There is, some testimony xebpecting some alterca-

tions~or jealousies between Faw and some of the arbi-

ters at a corporation election, but they were too trivial
'to be worthy- of notice, and as they occurred about the
time of the submission, and before the arbiters proceeded on the lusiness, it is supposed that they would have
induced Faw, had he thought them of any importance,
to make some effort to prevent an award.
Upon a view of the whole case, the Court is of opinion that the Plaintiff in the Court below has not show4
sufficient matter'to set aside the judgment at law, and
doth therefore direct that the decree of the Circuit
Court be reversed and annuled.

James Garrard, the Governor,-and sealed with the seal
of the said commonwealth of Kentucky, and in all respects, finally completed and issued to them the said
Darby and Hughes, and entered of record in the land

that the said land was patented to the said Darby and
Hughes, by the procurement and pretences of the said
James as aforesaid, without the Plaintiff's having ever
in any manner authorized, contracted, or consented,
that the same should be patented in the name of any
other person or persons whatsoever, other than himself.-And the Plaintiff produceth here in Court, a copy
of the-said patent, &c.
And whereas, afterwards, on the 13th of Mhrch, 1806,

To tlxe 3d and Ith pleas to the Ist.count, there -was,

After the jury had retired to consider of their verdict they returned into Court and requested the Court
to determine whether a verdict for the Plaintiff would
give to the Defendant all the right and interest of the
Plaintiff and his heirs inthe patent of land in the decla,
ration mentioned, and the Court instructed them that if
the Plaintiff should recover a judgment in this case, he
would be thereby barred in equity from setting aside

the-jtry that a recovery in this suit would bar the

M06RE.

I. The Plaintiff had no right to discontinue~as to the
first Count, after issue, Cre. Jac. 35, 316. The oyer being once prayed and grauted, the agreement and memorandum were spread upon the record, aind the Defendant had a~right to avail himself of it in all his pleas.
The Defendant had a right to show that the title of the
Plaintiff to those lands was never worth 2,0001, and
therefore he was never entitled to any thing more than
tie 3001. which Darby had paid him--consequently the
obtaining a patent in the name of Darhy and Hughes,
could be no injury to the Plaintiff; and if the Plaintiff
did promise to pay the 1001. it was a promisewithout
consideration. This was the real substantial defence in
the cause. In order'to entitle the Plaintiff to recover,
he must not only prove that the Defendant did a wrong
action, but that it didr an injury to the Plaintiff. 1.
Bat. Ab. 50. 6. .Aod. ,A.
2. As to the plea of the statute of frauds. By the act
of assembly of Virginia, p. p. 15, which' is like that of
Kentucky, it is enacted that no action shall be brought,
whereby to charge any person upon -any contract. for
the sale of lands, tenements, or hereditaments, unless
tije promse or agreement upon which such action shall
he brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall
be in writing, and signed by the pa y to be charged
therewith, or some other person by him 'thereunto lawfully authorized.

The contract set forth in ebch count of the declaration is a contractfor the sale of land. It is a contract
whereby the Plamitiff was to part with all his title to the
land, and it is immaterial whether that title was legal
,or equitable.
The first count states expressly, that the Plaintiff
"prolmised to quit all claim to the tract of land," and the
Defendant promisgd to pay 700 1.
The 2d count also states, th& the Defendant was to
paythe 7001. as compensahon frirthe injury and loss of the
land, and the Plaintiff agreed to accept it 66 m full of all

FEBRTARY TEIM. 1812.

187

claims and demans for the said land and forthe injury
aforesaxd."
The 3d. count slays, that a conversation was had concerning a compensation for the loss, and a liquidation of
the damages, sustained by the Platntijj by reason of the
misconduct and wrongdoing of the Defendant, and of tl&
vesting them, the said Darby and Hughes, with the legal'
title to the said land, and it was agreed sn consideration
of the, premises, that the Defendhnt should pay to the
Plaintiff 7001. in fdll satisfiction of the Plaintiffs claims
as aforesaid; Pnd the Plaintiff agreed, upon such ptLyment being made, to quit claim to the Defendant all the
Plaintiffs claims for compensation, &c. arising from the
wrong Aoig and misconduct of the Defendant in the
premises " andfrom the -vestingthe said Darby and Hughes
i"-with, the legal title to tie said land."
The %mcount. states that the Defendant agreei, iI
consideration of thejust clms of the Plaintiffto be com.
pensated for the danmage and injury aris g from the
misconduct of the Defendant in the premises, and in
consiuerationof the Defendants having procured a patent
to be issued to hiam and Darbyfor 'Ihe land,,that he, the
Defendant, would pay the Plaintiff another sum of
7001, &'.
Thus the quit-claim of the Plaintiffs title to the land
is the consideration of eviry promise in the declaration,
and if the Plaintiff had no title, or if no title was to.pass
from the Plaintiff, by the contract, it was uudum pactum.
3. If this was not a contractfor the sale of the Platntiff's title to the land, a judgment for hn in this suit
could not have barred the Plaintiff from setting aside
time patent in equity. There seems to have been an _aconsistency in the opinions of the Court below. If the
agreement extinguished the Plaintiffs equitable title,
then it was an agreement for the sale of land, and
ought to have been in writing. If it did not extinguish
the Plaintiff's equitable title, then it could not bar him
from setting aside the patent.

of any authority from Moore to Hughes to make this
transfer, but it was (lone by the latter vith a full knowledge that it waq contrary to the Plaintiff's intention. It
was of, itselfan injury to the Plaintiff for which he was
entitled to redress. It was actionable per se.
But suppose that a judgment for the. Plaintiff in this
case should prevent' him from setting aside the patent,
yet it does not follow that it is a case within the statute
of frauds. Contracts executed are not within that statute. If there be a verbal agreement for the sale of land,
and the vendor executes is part of the agreement by
conveying to the purchaser the legal title; which he accepts, and receives the possession and the title papers,
it is not necessary that the vendor should have a promnise in writing from the purchaser, in order to compel
him to pay for it-a Court of Chancery would decree
him to execute the contract.
The Plaintiffs subsequent ratification of the act of the
Defendant, was equivolent to his previous assent. The
ccontract then was executed on the part of Moore. The
Defendant had all his title-and the possession-and the
title papers. No further act was necessary on the part
of the Planif _ff.

M.ARcH 7th....JII tlw Judges beingiresent,

MARs ixu , Ch. J. delivered thp opinion of the Court
as follows
Much of the seemnigintricacy of this cause will dis-.
appear, if we extricate the questions made by the pleadings before the Court, from others which might greatly
embarrass and perplex it.
The -declaration contains four counts. T1he first recites an original contract between Cleon Moore and
John Darby, for the sale of certain lands, lying in Kentucky and proceeds to recount in detail those transaction's on which the action was founded. The other
counts state, in different terms, the several assumpsits,
which they allege to have been made.
The Defendants crave oyer of the written contract,
stated in.the first count, and file several pleas to that
0 It isuiqderstood that'the opinion of the Court below was g-ounded'on
the idea that thisease was to be governed by the pnneiples relative to implied
trusts'which are not within the statute of frauds. Darby &..H]ighes having
obtained the legal estate without the assent of the Plantf, were. to be
considered as holdingit in trust to secure to him the payment of7001. in ease
the land should turn out to be worth 20001. This was an smpid.-trustjresulting from the circumstances ofthe case, and- which would cease-to exist
upon payment ot the 7001. Upon the Plaintiff's receiving payment of that
sam, his equitable title would cease. It would not be transferred to the Defendant; but would lie extinguished. lithe 7001. mentioned in the declara,
tion were tobe considered as the compensation for the injury done in deprivin; the Plaintiffof his legal security for 7001. to be paid upon a contingency,
itis evident that that injury could not have exceeded 7001. And whether it
were to be paid ms compensation for that injury,-or as thsum which would.
be due upon the happening of the contingency, it would equally destroy ther
implied trust. And as an implied trust can be raised without writing, so, it
v~a thought, it could bi extinguisbed wthout writing.

count.. They then, without repeating the oyer, file'si-

milar pleas to the remaining counts. After taking issue on some of the pleas, and demurring to others, the
Plaintiff below discontinues his first count:

By the counsel for Hughes, this has been considered
as error. But the Court can perceive no reason for
this opinion. After this discontinuance, the parties are
in precisely the same situation, as if. all the issues both
of law and fact which were joined upon that count, had
been decided in favor of the Defendant below. Such decision could not, in point of law, have affected the rights
of the parties under the issues joined on the remaining
counts, and consquently the discontinuance upon that.
count must* leave those rights unimpaired. 'Whether
this count remain in the declaration, or be stricken out
of it, the right of the Plaintiff in the Circuit Court, to
recover on the other counts, will he precisely the same.
The examination of this right must be conducted on the
same principles as if the declaration had never contain,
ed the first count.
By the Plaintiff in error it is contended, that the oyer,
which was prayed of the written contract alleged in the
first count, spreads that contract on the record, and
makes it a part of all his subsequent pleas. This is
certainly true with reApect to all his subsequent pleas
to that count, but not with respect to his pleas to the
other counts. Different counts allege different contracts, and different assuippsits. It is upon this idea
alone, that a verdict can be rendered for the Plaintiff,
on one count, and for the Defendant on another. Now
-the over of one contract cannot be the oyer of another
contract, and cannot spread upon the record a contract
supposed to be. totally distinct from that which was read.
Tife discontinuance of the first count produces no change
in this -spect, in the condition -of the parties. Had it
remained, it could have had no influence on the other
counts, nor could the pyer of the written contract it
stated have transferred that contract to the other counts.
The second count states, that Uleon moore was owner and proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey for
hp4s lying in Kentucky, for which he was entitled to a
patet from the government 6f that State, and that

FEBRUARY TERM 18i.
James Hughes, without authority, transferred that plat HUGHus

patent for the said lanwas issued to the said Darby &
Hughes to the great injury of the said Moore. Thatafterwards the said Hughes promised to pay to the said
Moore, " the sum of seven hundred pounds for the said
injury, and loss of the said land assigned as aforesaid,
the said. Plaintiff at the same time, agreed to .the said
terms, and to accept of the said compensation in full of
all claims and demands for the said and and for the injury aforesaid."
T'o this count, the Defendant pleaded several pleas,
one of which was, that neither the promise nor any. memorandum thereof was made in writing. To this plea
the Plaintiff demurred, and the Cburt sustaifed the demurrer.
'The correctness of this decision depends entirely on
the application of the statute of frauds to the contract
stated in the declaration.
Cleon Moore is averred to' have been the proprietor of
a plat and certificate of survey on which Hughes &
Darby obtained a, patent by using his name without authority. This tortious act did not'divest Moore of his
equitable title. Thi land, in equity, was his. Did he
part with this title by the contract state~im the declaration ? The answer must, m the opinion of the whole
Court, be in the affirmative. "c He agreed to accept of
the said compensation in full of all claims and demands
for the said iqnd, and for-the injury aforesaid. This,
to sell his equitable title to the
.greenment
then, was an
land for the sum -of -seven hundred pounds. The Court
can perceive no-distinction between the sale of landkto
which a man -has only an equitable title, and a-sale,-of
land to which lie has. a legal title. They/are. equal.l
'within the statute.
It is, therefore, the unanimous opinion of this Court,
that the judgment upon the dqinurxer to this plea, ought
to have been ni favor of the, Defendant. below. Th'is
plea being a complete bar to the second count. it.is unnecessaiy to consider the other pleas.

zx.ns
Thethird count states the. title of leon Moore, and
V.
the injury-sustained by him to the same- effect with the
moowg. second count. It then states a conversation between
the parties, "c concerning a compensation -for the loss,.
"sand a liquidation of the damages sustained-by the said
".CleQn, by reason of the misconduct and wrong doing
6 of the said James in the premises, and of the vesting
," them, the said Darby & Hughes, with the legal title to
, the said land as aforesaid, and it was then and there
"1agreed by the said James, on his part, in considerade ion of the premises,-and of the just claims of the said
" Cleon, for.compensation and damages as aforesaid,
"that the said James should pay to the said Cleon, in
i satisfiaction for the same, the sum of 7001." &c. " And
"sthe said Cleon then and there agreed, on. his part, to
" accept of the said seven hundred pounds in full com"6pensation of his just claims as aforesaid," and, upon
the same being secured, &c. to release and quit claim
to the sald James, all his, the said Cleon's, claims and demands whatsoever, -for compensation, redress or danages-arising from the wrong doing and misconduct- of
the said James in the premises, and from the vesting the
said Darby & Hughes, with the legal title to the said
land as aforesaid.
To this counf also, the statute of frauds was pleaded
in bar. The Plaintiff be'low demurred to the plea, and
the Defendant joined in demurrer.
Upon the true construction e the contractstated in this
count, there was some contrariety of opinion among the
judges. It is, however, the opimon, of the majority
that the contract must be understood to import a, sale of
land, -and that the sum of money stipulated to be paid,
was, ii contemplation of the parties, to extinguish the ti;.
te of the said Cleon MAoore.
The conversation was " concerning a compensation
"6for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained
"sby the said Cleon," not only " by reason of the mis" conduct of the said Hughes, but also.' hy reason "1of
"5the vesting them, the said Darby & Hughes, with the
"legal title to the said land." ",And it was then
" agreed, in consideratiou of the just claims, of the said
" Cleon, for comensation and damages, that the said

6 James, should pay the said Cleon, in satisfacti6n fo r ssss
- the same, the sum of 70o.' To the majority of the
-.
Court, it seems, that a compensation foi the loss of the moosE;
title to the land must be understood to be a comensatioii -.
for the land itself, and ihat the receipt of this money by.
Cleon Moore, would not only have barred an action for
damages, but a suit iii equityfor the title.
If this opinion be correct, then the contract is substantiallyfor the sale of lanil, and, to be valid, ought to have
been in writing.

On this plea also.the demurrer ought

to have been overruled.

The fotrth count states the injury more in detail, than
is done in either the second or- third counts. It states
the claim of CIwn Moore to be compexisated for the loss
sustained byJiis land being granted without his consent
to Hughes and Darby. A conversation was then held,
and ",propositions -for a compromise were made, touch&
Ing the compensation and indemnification of,.him, the
said Cleon," "cand it was then and there agred by tho
"ssaid James, in consideration of the just claims of the
",said Cleon, to be compensated for the damage and
" njury for the misconduct of the said James in the prec mises, and in consideration of the said James having
"procured and obtained a patent to be conpleted and
" issued to the said James, and the raid John Darby, as
"last aforesaid, for the said land," that he, the said
James, would well and truly pay the said Cleon, one
other sum of 7001. This the " said Cleon agreed to
" accept in satisfaction of his just claims to compensa" tion arising from the- causes and considerations last
"aforesaid."
The compensation here offered and accepted, is.
for
the injury sustained by Cleon Moore, in consequence of
thegrant of his land, by the state of Kentucky, to
Ijughies and Daby. It seems to the Court, that this
compensation was in lieu of the patent itself, and must
have been intended to extinguzsh his right to that patent.
It is difficult to suppose an intention, in this case, to receive a full compensation for the loss of a title, and yet
to retain the right to that title. The majority of the
Court is of opiniont-hat, under the contractas stated in
ths count aloj the,payment of tb' Moey AÂ£gree to be

HuQE- s paid, would have extinmashed the right of Cleon Moore
to, the land in question, and that this CONTRACT likewise
V

It is unnecessary to examine other points wuch were
made in the cause. The .udgment of the Circuit Couift
