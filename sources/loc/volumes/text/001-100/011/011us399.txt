ordinary cases. This ,subject was considered in the
quoted case decided between these same parties in February, 1810. It is there laid down, and on reflection we
are confirmed in the opinion, that in the capacity of an
individual of the body corporate the Defendants are
bound by the by-law of the society as far as is consistent with the nature of its institutibn.
This case is within the 4th section of the 8th article
of those by-laws, and therefore the judgment below

The premises were struck off toL the Defendant, as
the highest bidder, at the price of 4,00 dollars ; -whereupon the auctionecr;m the presence of the- Defendant,
signed a certificate, at the foot of the articles of 'gale, declaring him to be the purchaser at that price.
An attorney was employed to draw a deed of bargain
and sale, and received instructions for that purpose,
both fi:om the Plaintiffs and Defendant, the draft of
the deed, with blanks for the date and the name of the
grantee, was presented toOihe Defendant, and left with
him for inspection, after examining it, he returned it to
the attorney, requesting him to insert his, the Defendants, name in the proper blanks, which he accordingly
did. Tins draught of the deed recited .the title of the
Plaintiffs, and that tile Defendant; being the highest
bidder, had purchased the premises at the sum of s,000
dollars, which he had secured to be pAid to the Plaintiff',
according to the terms of sale.
The breach ofthe agrgement alleged in the declaration,
was, that the Defendant had failed to give his promissory
notes within the 30 days, or at any time afterwards.
Th Court below decided that the Plaintiffs ,could
maintain no action up-on the contract, without first resorting to,a re-sale and ascertaning the deficit.

2. That the draught of the deed (as to its collateral

There was no argument for the Defendant in error.
.Marcli3d....LIVINGsToN, J. delivered the opinion of
the Court as follows
If there ever existed a valid agreement between these
parties in relation to the house in question, on which
the Court gives no opinion, the terms of it must be
sought for in the articles exhibited by the auctioneer, at
the time of sale. Of these, two only bear on this case.
These were,-", that the purchaser should secure the purh'chase money with interest by his promissory notes,
ccwith two approved mndorsers, payable in 6 and 12
cc months"-and" thatthe purchaser should be allowed
, thirty days to comply with these terms, at which
"time, in case of compliance, he was to receiye a good
"and complete title to the propertv, and on failing to
"comply within the thirty days, the property was then
J- to her e-sold on account of thefirst purchaser"
The Plaintiffs offered no evidence of any re-sale, or
of any deficiency ariging thereon, but contended, that
tihe remedy by a re-sale was merely cumulative, and
did not take away the right of action against the Defendant, for his violation of the contract.-Such is not
the opinion of this Court. The vendee, by the terms of
sale. had an option of taking the estate after it was bid
off to him, and in case of refusal, of having.it sold again
