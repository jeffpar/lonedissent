BAR ON

.
PETIT

This is a writ of ,error to a jadgmeit of the Cigcuit BAY&mw;
Court of Virguna, rendered upon a boxd given -by the
Plaintiffs iii error with condition for the delivery, at a
certai time and place, of property seized by the marshal to satisfy an execution which had issued from the
same Court. Th'e condition not having .been complied
with, thins judgment was rendered upon motion andnotice thereof duly served upon the obligors in the bond,
agreeably to the laws of Virginia.
It is not pretended that thre is any intrinsic error
in this judgment to'warrant its reversal, bujt it is contended that the reversal of the original judgment, upon
winch the proceedings in this record took place, requires necessarily the ieversat of this judgmenf. The
general doctrine is undeniably so, but the application
of'it to this caseis not admitted. That the judgment
in this record is dpendent upon some other judgment
xLapparent from the bond which recites a prior execution and seizure, by the marshal, of the property mentioned in the condition, for the purpose. of satisfying itX
but it does not appear, judicially to the Court that thd
recited execution issued upon the identical judgmuint
which has been reversed. The-only difficulty which the
Court has felt has been to devise some proper mode in
this, a" well as in all similar cases which may hereafter
arise, to connect with the origtnal reversed judgment
that which is asserted to be dpendent upon it.
A certiorariupon a suggestion of diminution would'
not answer the purposei as the proceedings in the original suit form no part of those in the subsequent suit:
the only foundation -of winch are, the bond and notice.
Neither does it appear. regular for tiis Court to receive
as evidence of the dependency of the latter upon the
former judgment, the certificate of the clerk of the Circuit Court.
The Court has thought it best to direct a special
writ to be framed applicable to cases of this nature, to
be directed to the clerk of the Court in wihich the judginents were rendered, to certify under the seal. of the

." 14 this case, ther Court from the novelty of the practice necessary to be adopted, will not permit the Plaintiff in error to suffer in consequence of his not having
applied sooner for a writ of certiorari, but will now direct the same to issue. In future the party must take
the consequences of his neglect, if lie should fail to have
the execution, certified in time.
Jtarch 16th.... WAs HNGTo, J. The Court has examined the execution which has been sent up by certioran, and is satisfied that the judgment on which it issued is that which was reversed at the last term. The
.judgment, therefore, on the forthcommg bond must be
reversed also.
