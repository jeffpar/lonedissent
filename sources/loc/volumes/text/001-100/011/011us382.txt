It is the.opinion of this Court that there is no error
in the decree of the Circuit Court for the county- of
Alexandria in determining that the Plaintiff, Susanna,
was entitled to dower in the estate of her late husband,
Lewis Hipkmns, deceased, but that there is error in not
requiring her to elect between her dower and the provision.iade for her in the will of her late husband, and
in not decreeing profits on the same. This Court doth
therefore reverse and annul the said decree, and doth

remand the cause to the said Circuit Court with instructions to reform the said decree according to the directions hereito contained.

The Aurora cleared out from Liverpool on the lith .

New Orleans. between the 2d and the 20th of Februarv, 1811.

JOSEPH R. INGERSOL,fI'

.ppeliant.

Here was no intent to violate the law. The vessel
cleared out before the proclamation was known in Liverpool, and a knowledge of that fact is not brought
home to' her. But if.it had beeni it was impossible for
her to know whether Great Britain would not, before
the 2d of February, revoke her obnoxious orders in
council, so that the law would never come into operation, even if the President could, by proclamation,
call it into existence. And the law, if it should take
effect, was not to go into operation until ,, the 20th of
May next." When was the 20th of May next? If the
law was revived by the proclamation, it could not be revived -until the 2d of February, 1811. It was to be
considered as being re-enacted on that day The 20th
of May next, therefore meant to the 20th of May, 18I1.
The words of the act of May ist, 1810, are, "cshall
"cfrom and after the expiration of three months from the
"date of the proclamation aforesaid, be revived, and
",have full force and effect." The provision that it
should begin to operate on the 20th of May next, was
as much a part of the law as any other of its provisions.
It was the intention of the legislature, that some warning should be given to the citizens of the United States,
so that they might by possibility avoid forfeiture under
it. But if that _provision 4e not adopted as well as the
others, it was impossible to avoid the penalties of the
law, for until the 2d of February, it would at all events
be lawful to import, and until after that day it would be
impossiblto know that Great Britain -had not revoked
her edicts, so that if the law was to take effect- on that

This could not have been the intention of the Iegislature. Eftfct ought, if possible, to be given to the words,
after the 20th of fayj ext, and the most matured construction is that the legislature meant the 20th of May
next following the day, when the act should become absolute,, by the happening of the contingency on wheh
its existence was to depen(. A contrary -construction
would attribute to the legislature the most flagrant injustice ; that of punishing a man under a law of which
it was inpos4ible he should have had a knowledgb.
Whoever heard of a conditional penal law, the condition. of 'uhich was to be decided by the party, and
wich it was impossible for him to decide until after
the law became absolute ? The President was not authorized to decide it. Every man was to ascertain the
fact for himself.
liut Congress could not transfer the legislative power to the President. To make the revival of a law depend upon the President's proclamation, is to give to
that proclamation the force of a law. Congress meant
to reserve to themselves thepower of ascertaining when
ths condition should have been performed. Tls is to
be inferked from the act of Makch 2d, 1811,by whidh
it is enacted, that until Great Britain shall so revoke
her edicts, &c. and until that fact shall be proclanned
by the President, the enumerated sections of the act 61
March Ist, 1809, tnterdicting, 4-c. s6 shall have full force,
and be (i. e. shall be) immediately carried into effect."
These expressions strongly imply that those sections of
the act were not already in full force, and had n0t bpem
carried into effect.

of May, 1809, which had passed when the law of May

The legislature meant to .revive the law as it existed on the day of its expiration. The words after iie

,were as inoperative as if they llad been expunged from

This is an appeal from a decision of the district Court,
of Orleans, on a libel.preferred against the goods in
question, under the non-intercourse acts of March 1st,
1809, and May Ist, 1810.
These goods were claimed by .Robert Burnside, a
citizen of Oleans, as his property, and the material
questions in the cause are,

March 2d1811.

CARGO
2d. Was the act of ist March, 1809, revived by the
or ERIG President's proclamation at all, and if revived, did it
vu&oBA commence its operation on the 2d February, or on the
v.
20th May following, the time of issuing that proclaXT.STAT.S. mation.

On the quiestion of fact, the Court are of opinion, that
the evidence is not sufficient to prove the property American. The national character of the property the
Claimant might easily have established by his correspondence, and the examination of witnesses inEurope.
No such evidence is resorted to. The bill of lading
alone is resorted to, on which it is said to be shipped on
account of a citizen of the United States, and consigned to Burnside., but the name of the owner is not inserted. Here again the defect of evidence may have
been supplied by evidence who this citizen was, but no
such evidence is adduced.
In the examination of the two clerks of John Rason
& Co. of Liverplool, it is simply stated, that these goods
were shipped by John Richardson, of Liverpool, but on
whose account they do not state, nor does it appear that
they were examined to that point.
Upon the whole, we are of opinion, that the absence
of proof which might so easily have been supplied, Will
authorize a conclusion, that the property was not American.
On the second point, we cansee no sufficient reason,
why the legislature should not exercise its discretion
in reviving the act of March Ist, 1809, either expressly
or conditionally, as their judgment should'direct. The
19th section of that act declaring that it should continue
in force to a certain time, and no longer, could not restrict their power of extending its operation, without
limitation upon the occurrence of any subsequent combination of events.
On the question when the operation of the Ith section of the act should commence, we are of opinion that
y rev iVng an act, the legislature must be understood
to give it, from the time of its revival, precisely t1at
force and effect which it had' at the moment when it ex-

Some objections have been made to the sufficiency of
the libel, because it does not negative the fact of Amenrican property. But on that subject, we are of opinion,
that in no case can it be necessary to state in a libel,
any fact which constitutes the defence of the Claimant,
or a ground of exception of the operation of the law on
which the libel is founded.
