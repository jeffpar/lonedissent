FEBRUARY TERM i413.
The Court did not act on this motion, and, of course, sv.z~u &
the points do not appear, so as to enable tis Court to
urrcHtake notice of them.
AWAN
The Defendants (it was said) would not agree to any
arrangement by which the legal merits of the cause, as
they appeared below, might come into discussion here.
PNxqNBY, .Attorney Gentral.forPlantiffs in error,
Contended that the verdict was imperfect, contradic
tory and void, and did not warrantithe judgment pro-.
nounced upon it, nor any other judgment. 23 Vin. 397,
pl. 10. It is neither a general nor a special verdict.
HARPER, contra,

Admitted that it was in form an irregular proceed=
Ing, but he was instructed to insist on the .judgmeit.
It is a general verdict for the Defendants: and by
consent of parties it was referred to the Court; -and if
they should be of opinion that the verdict should not
ptand, they were to award a venre de novo. It was -the
negligence of time Plaintiffs in not having the facts, or
the points and'consent, stated on the record.
It is evident that what was done was by conseif.
The Plaintiffs do not appear to.'have wished to brin;
the case here, but were at the time contented to rely
on the opinion of the Court' below.
A sRsALL, Ch. .T. The case is*too plain for argu.
ment. The jury did not intend to find a general verdict, but to submit the points of law to theÂ°Court. If
the law' had been for the Plaintiffs the Court could only
have awariled a -venire de novo. The facts ought to
mq.ve appeared, so that the judgment might have been
either reversed or affirmed upon the meirits.

Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.
