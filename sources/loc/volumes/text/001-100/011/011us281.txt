The orler of the. Court, settling the account is adudicud, not a jainisterial act.
Had the Orphan's Court power. to settle and adjlst
the account?
By the act, of assembly of Maryland, of February,
1777, c. 8, which wAs in force At the time these letters
of administration were granted, the Orphaii's Courts
had all the jurisdiction and authority which the com1mussary general had before.
By the act of 1715, c. 39. sect. 2, the commissary
general was to proceed according to the laws of Eng3

By the 40th section, the prerogative Court (winch was

v.

By the act of I718, c 5, the person entitled to the
residue of an estate may, after 12 months from the date
of the letters of administration, sue ;,fop such residuary
"part as shall appear to be due by such accounts as
"shall then be made up."
This jurisdiction over accounts appears also in the
practice of the commissary's Court, as stated in the
deputy commnissary's guzde, p. 45 to 49, which shows, also
that the settlement of the account by that Court was always holden to be conclusive upon the County Courts.
In the appendix p. 198, ig the form of a spucial commission to pass an account. It appears also that all
the vouchers are to be surrendered and filed upon
passing the account. This shows that it must be conclusive, for nothing could be more unjust than to oblige
A-man to be always ready to account and to support
his account, after taking from him all his vouchers.
DUvALL, J.

The account was pnly binding upon the representatives of the estate, the dfitributees, and they might still
open it in the general Court. But the creditors are
no parties'to the settlement of the account, and cannot
bo bound by it.
There can be no .doubt tlhat the judgment against the
administratrix, the inventory and two first accounts
were conclusive evidence of a devastavzt.
fAusnALL, Ch. J. HL
believe that is the law throughout the United States.
The Court is unanimously of opinion that the settlement ofthe account by the Orphan's Court is notcoaclusive evidence for theefendant upon the issue joined.
