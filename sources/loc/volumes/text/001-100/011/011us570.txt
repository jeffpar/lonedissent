v.
That proclamation is not set forh in the libel, so that
the act done does hot appear by the libel to be contrary U.STATES.
to law. The libel ought to have stated that France
had before the 2d of March, 1811, so revoked her edicts
as that they ceased to violate the neutral commerce of
the United States, and that the president had declared
it by his proclamation. This is not like the revival or
continuance of %law by a law, but when the revival of
a law is to depend upon a matter of fact, the libel ought
to state'the fact, that the Court may judicially know
whether the law be revived or not.,
This Court has decided at this term that

the act of March 1, 1809, was in force in February,

C. Lun. If that point has been 'decided it was when
I was not-present, and shall forbear to make any further observations, but if it had not been decided, I
should have adduced the new evidence communicated to
congress by the late documents to show that in March,
1811, the Berlin and Milan decrees were not repealed,
and that the repeal did not take place till the 28tl of
April.
JOHNSON, J. That point was considered in the case
of the .urora. (Alnte p. 382.)
JON.Es, contra,

The cases of the Iloppet and the .urora have settled
all the points in this case. except the omission to state
in the libel, the president's proclamation. The Court
can take notice of the law, and therefore can notice the
proclamation authorized by that law.

Then as to the objections to the form of the

libel. This is not a case in which the Appellant could
plead 7iot gulty, and put the United States upon the
proof of every thing alleged. But lie is to put in his
