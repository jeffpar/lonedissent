v'"
WIL.IAMS

MAusALL, Ch. . The writ of error is to the original decree, which did not aw#Ard this writ. of habere
facids. It was awarded by a subsequent order of tli6
Court, to which no writ of error issued.

it, the habere faezas was issued in conformity with the
practice in that state, as admitted by the counsel on
both sides in the Court below. It was ordered as a matt~r of course, and no objection was made. If this motion should prevail, it will make the writ of error operate as a sutpersedeas, contrary to the intention of the
act of Congress.
