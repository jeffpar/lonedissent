It appearsi then, both from the libel and claim, that a AcTIvB
V.
part of the cargo did " belong, bona fide, to a person
other than the master, owner or mariners of the ship U.sTATES.
or vessel." This part of the cargo comes completely
within that part of the description which relates to .the
ownership of the property But the goods on board
being liable to no duty, the duties could not have been
previously paid or secured..
'li'e ourt considers this section as manifesting a
clear intention in the legislature to exempt from forfeiture.a cargo not belonging to the owner, master or
mariners, provided that cargo was not liable to duties.
Whether thins condition was produced by a previous
paynent of duties, orby a perfect exemption from duties, must be immaterial. Duties cannot be paid or sesured, according to law, on goods not liable, by law, to
duty. The legislature must be.uuderstood, when saying cc upon winch the duties have been previously paid
or secured according to law," to mean, "cupon wnch
the duties, if anuy, have been previously paid," &c.
It is "theopinion of the court, that the sentence of the
Circuit Court be reversed as to so much of tfie cargo of
the sloop Active as'is claimed as the property of
Gates, and be affirmed as to the vessel and ,the residue
of the cargo.
And it is directed to be certified that therb was
probable cause of seizure.
