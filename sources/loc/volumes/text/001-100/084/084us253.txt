TYLER V. MAGWIRE.

Syllabus.

title to the land in controversy is in the appellee, and thatthere is no error in the record.
DECREE AFFIRMED IN EACH CASE.

NOTE.
WARNER V. JOY.
No. 327.

THE decree in this case (like the preceding one, an appeal
from the District of Kansas) was also affirmed; Mr. Justice
CLIFFORD (who delivered the judgment of the court) observing,

that it was clear that such a decree must be given, on an application of the principles adopted and the reasons given in the
case just decided; as the pleadings were substantially the same
ad in it, and there vas a stipulation of the parties that the court
might take and determine the demurrer- filed upon the agreements made in that case and without further argument.
So, too, judgment was here affirmed on a w'it of error (No.
328) to the same district, in a suit of ejectment by Toy against
Warner for these same lands, where judgment had been given
in favor of Joy; Air. Justice CLIFFORD, who delivered the judgment of the court, saying that the questions presened for decision were "in all respects the same as those presented and
decided in Holden v. Joy;" and that "the court, without hesitation, decides that theititle of the plaintiff is complete, and that
he is entitled to judgment for the recovery of the possession of
the premises in controversy."

TYLER V. MAGWIRE.
The Supreme Court of the State of Missouri, on appeal, dismissed a peti-

tion which sought to have the title to lands held by the defendant, under
a patent from the United States, divested, and vested in the complainant.
From this decree of dismissal a writ of error brought up the case under
the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, the complainant claiming
the land under a former patent from the United States.
