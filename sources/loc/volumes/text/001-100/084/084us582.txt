Statement of the case.

THE MERRITT.
1. A vessel built in the British Province of Canada, but owned wholly by
citizens of the United States, cannot under the Registry Act of 1702
(1 Stat. at Large, 287) be a vessel of the United States; nor can she be
a foreign vessel truly and wholly belonging to citizens of Canada or of
Great Britain. If, therefore, such a vessel be engaged in tran-porting
the products of Canada into ports of the United States, she may be forfeited under the act of March 1st, 1817 (3 Stat. at Large, 351), which
enacts, under penalty of forfeiture, that "no goods, wares, or merchandise
shall be imported into the United States from any foreign port or place, except
in vessels of the United States, or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly
belong to the citizens or subjcts of that country of which the goods are the
growth, production, or manufacture."
2. Nor, assuming that neither Great Britain nor the Dominion of Canada
have adopted "a similar regulation," could the vessel, in the absence of
all doculnents, such as establish nationality, be taken to be a British or
Canadian vessel, and so held to fall within the prbviso to the above
quoted enactment, which provides, "that this regulation shall not extend to
the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted, and which shall not
adopt, a similar regulation."

APPE AL from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of

Wisconsin ; the case being thus:
By a statute of 1792,* it is enacted that no ships but those
which have been registered in the manner therein prescribed, shall be denominated or deemed vessels of the
United States, entitled to the benefits or privileges -ipportaining to such ships. Great Britain has a similar regulation, fixing what are to be regarded as British vessels.
By ai act of March 1st, 1817,t it is enacted,
"SETIo1N 1. That after the 30th day of September next, no
goods, wares, or merchandise shall be imported intg the United
States from any foreign port or place, except in vessels of the
United States, or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly
belong to the citizens or subjects of that country of which the
goods are the growth, production, or nanufaiture; or from
which such goods, wares,- or merchandise can only be, or most
.usually are, first shipped for transportation.

Argument for the claimant.

"Provided, nevertheless, That this regulation shall not extend
to the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted, and
which shall not adopt, a similar regulation."
A subsequent section of the latter act enacts that the vessel and cargo coming into the United States, in violation of
those provisions, shall be forfeited.
In this condition of things-as appeared by the libel, information,'and answer:hereafter mentioned-the bark Merritt, built in the province of Canada and within.the dominion
of Great Britain, but wholly owned by citizens of the United
States, was employed in transporting coal and iron, products
of the said province of Canada, friom the-port of Kingston,
in the province named, into the port of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States.
Hereupon, a libel and information waa filed in behalf of the
United States alleging the facts above stated. One lurray,
owner of the vessel, interposed as claimant, and not denying
the allegations, answered, that at the time of the importations on account of which the proceedings were taken,
neither the imperial government of Great Britain nor the
Dominion of Canada* had adopted any "similar regulation"
to that contained in the abov&-quoted act of 1817; and that,
therefore, the case was taken out of the statute by the pi'oviso
to it. This answer was excepted to as irrelevant; that is to
say was, in effect, demurred to; and the exception or demurrer being sustained by the court below, on an appeal
from the District Court, the case was now brought here by
Murray for review. The vessel had exhibited no papers.

" This averment as to the Dominion of Canada was made, of course, under
the supposition that the act of 8O Victoria, chapter 3 (2 Law Reports
Statutes, 91, p. 21), which, it was said, gives to the Parliament of Canada
'(subject to a power of veto in the Crown) exclusive regulation in IIthe regulation of trade and commerce," and "1in navigation and shipping," might
have made it a " country" within the meaning of the enacting clause of the
act of 1817. As the vessel showed no papers from any source the point was
unimportant.

Argument for the United States.

be to bring her within the regulations of the act of 1817she was either British or Canadian, it matters not which.
As such, she would not be liable, falling within the proviso
to section one, "that this regulation shall not e~tend to the
vessel of any foreign nation which has not adopted and which shall
not adopt a similar regulation."
The act of 1817 was intended to retaliate upon Great
Britain her unfriendly legislation on the subject of it, commencing with her act of 12th Charles II,"for th6 encouraging and increasing shipping and navigation," and continued
by numerous subsequent enactments, all of which were supposed to have been reserved in force by the convention between the United States and Great Britain of July 3d, 1815.*
.Wecould show, we think, if it would aid us, the unqualified
repeal by Parliament, long prior to the alleged offence, of

all its legislation on the subject. Our. allegation of fact is,
that there was no regulation by either Great Britain or
Canada "similar" to that of our act of 1817; that, on the
contrary, American vessels were freed and absolved from all
such restraints. This averment, however, stands admitted
by the exception.
2d. If the Merritt was not a foreign vessel, that is to say,
a vessel to which no distinct nationality could be assigned,
then she has been guilty of -no infraction of .the law. If bythe act of transfer from British to American citizens, she
was utterly denationalized, and became a mere rover of the
sea, without country, then she is not within the act of Congress. The act was not directed against such possible class
of ships. Itwas not the mischief intended to be cured. We
must have new legislation to forfeit a vessel thus circumstanced.

Opinion of the court.

a similar policy, does not cover the vessel seized here, which
has no national character whatever. The Merritt is not
American;* nor is it British,t nor Canadian. She must,
therefore, be a foreign vessel within the meaning of the act.
Mr. Justice RUNT delivered the opiniQn of the court.
The first section of the act of 1817 prohibits the importatioa of any goods or wares from any foreign port into the
United States, except in two cases:
1st. They.may be imported in vessels of the United States;
or,

2d. In such- foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to
the citizens or subjects of the country of which the goods
are the production, or from which they are most usually
first shipped for transportation.
The claimant's auswer does not bring him within either
of these classes.
1. The 24erritt is not a vessel of the United States. The
information alleged-it was not denied-and that is all that
the case contains upon the subject,-that the Merritt was the
property of citizens of the United States, and that she was
a foreign-built vessel. That she was owned by citizens of
the United States did not make her a vessel of the United
States. By the statute of 1792 only ships which have been
registered in the manner therein prescribed shall be den ominated or deemed vessels of the United States, entitled to the
benefits or privileges appertaining to such ships. There is
no allegation that the Merritt had been so registered. Indeed, she could not have been under the provisions of the
act last referred to.
2. The cargo of the Merritt was iron and lumber, the production of the British provinces of Canada, while her owners
were citizens of the United States. She did not, thereforej
come within the second description of the statute of 1817,
-"See act of 1792, cl. 1, 1 Stat. at Large, 287; 1 Parsons on Shipping, 28.
Abbott on Shipping, 79, and (since) 17 and 18 Vict., c. 104; 18 and 19
Vict., a. 91; 25 and.-26 Vict., c. 63.

t

Syllabus.

as.a foreign vessel truly and wholly belonging to citizens of
the country of which the cargo was the growth or production. On the contrary, it is conceded by the pleadings that
her owners were American citizens. The Merritt, therefore, falls Within the prohibition of the act, and is liable to
forfeiture. She was neither a vessel of the United States
nor a fbreign vessel, wholly belonging to citizens of the
country of. Wdhich her cargo was the production.
But the claimant seeks the benefit of the proviso of the
act, viz.: "That this regulation shall not extend to the vessels of any foreign nation which has not adopted, and shall
not adopt,'a similar regulation." He.alleges that neither
the kingdom of Great Britain nor the province of Canada
has adopted similar regulations.
The case does not show that the Merritt has any of the
evidences of being aBritish ship. She produces no register,
or. certificate, or document of any kind to entitle her to
make that claim. The fact that she is foreign-built does not
pr6ve it. Proof even that she was built in Great Britain
would not estblish it. Pirates and rovers may issue from
the most peaceful and most friendty ports. The documents
a vessel carries furnish the only evidence of her nationality.*
Of these the M'erritt is entirely destitute, so far as the case
shows. ""lhere is-nothing, therefore, to bring her within the
terms of the proviso.
