accident, or by mistake, without fault on his part,'the defendant has been deprived of the opportunity to make his

JUDGM.NT AFFIRMED.

SMITHs v. SHOEMAKEj.
1. In an action ofejectment, a letter of the plaintiff's grantor, written to the
ancestor of the defendant, is.not competent evidence to show that the ancestor entered'into possession under the license of the plaintiff-s grantor,
without some evidence that such letter was received or acted on about
the time of such entry by the ancestor.
2. L.general objeetibn that such letter is a declaration of the grantor of his
own rights was sufficient.
3. If, in the appellate court, the party introducing such a letter relies on
any special circumstances as an exception to the rule (as that it was part
of the 2esgestw), that eircumstance must appear in the bill of exceptions
or by the record in some other manner. The admission will be held to
be erroneous unless this appears.
4. There being no extrinsic evidence that the letter was ever received or
acted on by the ancestor, the date found in the letter, though near the
time of entry, is not sufficient evidence of that fact to justify its admission. The important fact being its receipt by the defendant's ancestor,
at a particular time, cannot be established by the date found in the
letter for the purpose of admitting the letter. The date would thus
p~rove the letter, and the letter prove the date, without evidence that
either was true.
5. Wfien it is argued here that an error in the court below worked no injury
to the party complaining, the fact that it worked no injury must be
made to appear beyond question. If it is oiily to be seen by a mere
preponderance of evidence, and the error is substantiated, the judgment must be reversed.

Beal, in trust for a certain Kilty Smith during life, and oi
his death for his son John Chandler Smith. After the (late
of this deed, Kilty Smith had another soi, to wit, Hamilton
Smith, the father of the defendants. On the trial, the plaintif; Shoemaker, having shown title in the above-named John
Chandler Smith, completed his title by showing a conveyance from the said John Chandler Smith to himself, dated
June 20th, 1868.
The bill of exceptions now thus stated the case as made
by the defendants:
"The defendants, then, to maintain the issues upon their part
introduced parol evidence, tending to show that Hamilton Smith
. . . entered into the possession of the premises in controversy

in the year 1845, with his family, claiming title thereto through
a parol gift of the property from his father, John Kilty Smith';that he continued to reside thereon with his family until his
death in 1857; that his children, the pyesent defendants, Caroline and Mary, were born upon the said premises; . . . tldatCaroline was born in December, 1845, and'-ary in.October,
1847; that the said Hamilton during such occupancy always
claimed to own the said premises as aforesaid; that after his
death his children continued in the uninterrupted possession
thereof continuously, claiming the absolute ownership of -said
property as heirs-at-4aw and representatives of their deceased
father, which possession was by residence, use., and occupatiu,
and with fixed inclosures,-from the entry of the said Hamilton,
in 1845, till thq presefit time."
The plaintiff then; without giving any account of when it was
written, or'where it had come from, or how he came possessed of
the letter, in order to show that the possession of the defendants was not 2dverse to the title of John Chandler Smith,
but was held under Mim, and was by license or permission
from him, offered in evidence a letter thus:

.The defendant objected to the reception of the letter in
evidence.

letter of those under whom he claims title, to show under whom
the defendants or their ancestor went into possession of the

The defendants then introduced evidence tending to prove
that Hamilton Smith was a man of infirm capacity for business, of a nervous temperament, and easily frightened, and
dependent upon others for the transactioil of any important
business; that in his lifetime he paid the taxes on the property, the receipts for which, with other papers, were'taken
by John Chandler Smith; that he handed over to the said
John, to take care of and receive the interest on, bonsls to
the amount of $20,000, which his father had given to him.
* The court having charged the jury (among numerous
other things), that twenty years of open, notorious, visible,
continuous possession of inclosed property, under claim of
title, against all the world, would, of itself, as a general rule,
amount to a valid title; yet, that4f the defendants had obtained their possession in subservience to or under the plaintiff, they would not be allowed afterwards to set up a claim
to the property by means of their possession, and the jury
having found for the plaintif, and, judgment having been
entered accordingly, the case-was now here on exception to
the admission.of the letter purporting to have been written
September 10th, 1845, and given supra, on page 631. Errors

had been taken to it.

made by parol to a third person having no privity with the
defendants or those under whom they claim.* The effect
of its admission was simply to mislead the jury, and when
taken in connection with the instruction, that "if the defendants have obtained their possession in subservience to,
or under the plaintiff, they are not allowed afterwards to set
up a claim to the property by means of their possession,"
was conclusive of the whole case against the defendants.
Merrik, contra:
M r.BT..
The defendant objected below to the reception of the letter
for seven different 'easons, all specific in character. No one
.of these' reasons is the one now urged before the court, to
wit, in effect that the letter was not written at the time
whet it bears date, and that it was not received by Hamilton
Smith. Is not the objection which was actually taken, to
wit, that "there was nothing to show the letter was in response to any letter written by Hamilton Smith, or that Hamilton Smith ever replied to it" an implied admission that he
had received it. Would any such specific, acute, far-fetched,
and not very satisfdctory objections as those two have been
made, if it had been possible to make with truth the one
natural and conclusive objectioil, that no such letter had
ever been really written in 1845 to Hamilton Smith, or at
least that le had never received any such letter? an objection which would have rendered both these two reasons and
indeed all the others-no one of the whole seven being
sound even if the letter had been inadmissible-superfluous.
Suppose that I claim a house as owner. Years afterwards

saying that, he were to say, "That letter was not in response
to anything I wrote to you," and "I never replied to that
letter," would he not make a clear though implied admission
that he had received the letter? Independently of this, it
being necessary that the court should satisfy itself of any
fact oi which the admissibility of the letter depenlded,* it is
to be presumed that proof of such necessary- fact was made
to the judge trying the case.
The letter being thus proved to have been received, the
date of the letter, September 10th, 1845, is prima facie evidence of the time when it was written.t Moreover, the letter
is part of the res gesit under which Hamilton Smith obtained his possession.
Finally, if it was error in the court to admit the letter, it
was not such-an error as will warrant a reversal in this case;
because the admissions of Hamilton Smith, in his letters of
1856 (supra, pages 633, 634), to the effect that he held under
and by permission of John Chandler Smith; was conclusive
against the adversary character of the possession set up as
the defence against the admitted record title, and required
the jury to find for the plaintiff.$£

Mr. Justice MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
The admission of the letter having at its head, as a date,
"September 10th, 1845," was objected to, and an exception
taken, on the ground, among others, that the plaintiff could
not introduce his own declaration, or that of those under
whom he claimed, to show that the ancestor of the defendants
had entered under the person making the declaration. 'Other
and more specific grounds of objection were taken, but it is
not necessary to mention them here, for it is certainly a

SMITHS V. SHOEMAKER.

Opinion of the court.

sound principle of evidence that such a declaration as this,
.whether oral or in writing, is inadmissible, unless some exception to the general rule be shown. And this disposes of
one of the drguments against the validity of the exception,
namely, that while seven distinct objections are stated in the
bill of exceptions, none of them are sound, though the letter
may really have been inadmissible. We are of opinion that
the one above mentioned is sufficient, unless the record
shows some matter which would obviate it.
The objection is supposed to be removed by treating the
letter as a part of the transaction by which Hamilton Smith
obtained possession of the property, and thus coming within
the rule of exceptional evidence admitted as part of the res
gestIe.
But the difficulty is that there is no evidence that the
letter was a part of that transaction. The precise time when
Hamilton Smith took possession is not stated, save that it
was in 1845, and after the 28th of May. .Thedate found in
the letter itself is relied on to show that it was written about
the time possession was taken, Mnd perhaps, if the other
essential requisites were proveni the time would be near
enough to let it go to the jury. But it is obvious that, as
the date is only proved by the letter, the fact that the letter
was written and received, must be proved before the date
can be used to justify the admission of the letter. Many
authorities are cited to show that, while the date found in
an instrument may be disputed or disproved by other evidence, it is prirni facie to be taken as the true date. All
these cases, however, have reference to the case of an instrument which has been admitted in evidence on other and
sufficient ground, and where the. true date has become important on some other issue than the admission of the letter.
It is a most vicious example of reasoning in a circle, to admit the letter to prove the time when it was written, and
assume this to be the real date for the purpose .of admitting
the letter.
Another objection is, that there is nothing in the record
to show that the letter was delivered to Hamilton- Smith, or

SMITHS V.

[Sup. CL

Opinion of the court.

was ever in his possession or acted upon by him. It is not
shown how the plaintiff came into possession of it, or from
what source it was produced by his counsel at the time of
the trial. It would violate nothing found in the 'record to
suppose that the letter was written and delivered to the plaintiff by its supposed author on the same day it was read in evideuce. When a party seeks to justify in a court of review
the admission of such ex pare declarations of himself or his
vendor, against the objection of the other side, he must
show by the record some circumstance which would obviate
the manifest soundness of the objection.
It is said, however, that, conceding the letter to have been
improperly admitted, there is enough found in the rec6rd to
show that the verdict was right, if it had been excluded, and,
therefore, its admission worked the defendants no prejudice.
Two letters from Hamilton Smith to his brother are relied on to show his admission, as late as 1856, that he held
under that brother, and acknowledged his superior title.
And it must be conceded that they have a strong tendency to
estab ish that.proposition. -'Butthey are not conclusive; and,
'in the face of the statement that the defendants introduced
parol evidence tending to show that Hamilton Smith entered
under a parol gift of his father, it is impossible to say the
letter worked no prejudice. "This parol evidence is not given
in the bill of exception, and may have beeni very strong. It
is possible, nay, probable, that the jury, balancing between
the weight of the parol evidence on one side and the letters
* of Hamilton Smith on the other, may have rested their verdict on this letter, as the best evidence of what really occurred at the time possession was taken. The jury might
very well have said that, if this letter was written and received about the time the possession was taken-written by
*the man who had title to the land to the party about to enter
into possession-they would presume that the latter entered
on the premises under the permission given in the letter,
while they might disregard the improvident admissions of a
weak-minded and dependent man made to his brother ten
or twelve years later.

DANIEL V.

WHARTENBY.

Statement of the-case.

We repeat the doctrine of this court laid down in Deery v.
aj,* that while it is a sound principle that no judgment
should be reversed on error when the error complained of
worked no injury to the party against whom the ruling was
made, it must appear so clear as to be beyoind doubt that the
error did not and could not have prejudiced the right of the
party. The case must be such that this court is not called
on to decide upon the preponderauce of evidence that the
verdict was right, notwithstanding the error complained of.
Other errors are assigned as to the charge of the court,
but, as no exception was taken to that charge, it cannot be
considered; nor do we deem the errors alleged as growing
out of the prayers -asked and refused likely to occur again,
even if they are fairly presented by the record now.
For the error in admitting the letter objected to the judgment is reversed and the case remanded for
NEW TRIAL.

Mr. Justice DAVIS was absent at the argument.

A testator gave his estate, both real and personal, to his son, R. T., "during
his natural life, and after his death to his issue, by him lawfully begotten
of his body, to such issue, their heirs and assigns forever." In case
R. T. should die without lawful issue, then, in that case, he devised the
estate to his own widow and two sisters, "during the natural life of
each of them, and to the survivor of them," and after the death of all
of them to J. W., his heirs and asigns forever; with some provisions
in case of the death of J. W. during the life of the widow and sisters.
Held that the rule in Shelly's Case did not apply, and that the estate in

such issue, and in default of such issue remainder for life to his widow
