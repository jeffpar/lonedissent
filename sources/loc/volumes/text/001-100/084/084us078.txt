HlARWOOD V. RAILROAD COMPANY.

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

the compensation allowed was insufficient, and the assistant
quartermaster, on the 19th of December of that year, made
a settlement with the clairant and increased the allowance

'to $145 'per day, and the finding of the Court of Claims
shows that the account made out in that way was received
and receipted by the claimant "as in full of the above account," being the account made .out in that way for the ser-

vices of the steamer.
Enough appears to satisfy the court that the charter-pary
was superseded, and that the claim was in fact for a quantum
meruit, and as such that it was the proper subject of compromise within the principle adopted and applied in the case of
.Masonv. United States, decided at the present term.* Prior
to the adjustment the sum" allowed was $140 per day, but
that allowance was not satisfactory to the claimant, and the
assistant quartermaster, as matter of compromise, agreed to
add $5 per day in addition to that allowance, and the claimant having accepted the offer, received the money, and executed a discharge in full of the claim, cannot prosecute a
suit in the Court of Claims for what he voluntarily relinquished in the compromise.
Parties may adjust their own disputes, and when they do
so voluntarily and understandingly, no appeal lies to the
courts to review their mutual decision.

from the District Court for the District of Indiana.
Harwood, March, and several other persons, representing
that they were stockholders in the Cincinnati and Chicago
Railroad, "a corporation now disorganized and unable to
sue," filed, on the 25th of -December, 1865, a bill in the court
below against the Air-Liue Railroad Company, one Brandt,
and several additional pers6ns, to vacate a decree rendered
in the same court in the early part of the year 1860, in a
suit by George Carlisle as trustee of a second mortgage on
the road for the benefit of a certain second issue iSf bonds,
against the said Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad 'ompany.
The suit of Carlisle had been for the foreclosure of the said
mortgage upon the road, given to secure the second mortgage bonds; and, in form at least, had been regular. The
bill in the present case alleged fraud and collusion in that
suit between Carlisle and his confederates and certain other
persons, wh6 were lessees of the road and in its possession,
and who had agreed to pay the interest on its mortgages.
It alleged that by the concurrence of these several parties
the road had been allowed to lose credit, and that the payment of interest on its second mortgage bonds was wilfully
neglected in order that the property might be sold; that
this arrangement had been carried out, and that the road
had been sold and purchased in by the conspirators for
about $25,000, when it was really worth about $2,000,000
above a first mortgage of the same sum to which it was subject; and that the stockholders in the original road were
injured by this collusive and fraudulent sale.
The bill prayed that the said alleged collusive and fraudulent sale might be set aside, the complainants and their costockholders remitted to their original rights in the former
corporation, and permitted to redeem the road from the first
mortgage, still upon it.
Carlisle was not made a party defendant to this bill.

Opinion of the court.

By way of showing why their bill was not earlier brought,
the complainants alleged that they knew the road was leased
out of the power of the company, as they supposed, until
1862, and that they knew that it had been sold as above set
forth, except that they were entirely ignorant of the fraudulent acts, arrangements, and combiuations by which the sale
was brought about and executed; that they trusted in their
officers and supposed that all was fairly done; that on the
sale the corporation ceased practically to exist, and that the
officers industriously concealed from the stockholders the
frauds perpetrated, and that these last had no organ to act
in the premises; that in 1865 they learned from divers
sources (the war having previously directed attention from
the matter), that frauds had been perpetrated, but that they
did not learn particulars; that the stockholders were scattered in several States, and had to be consulted and measures
taken to raise men and money to investigate the transactions; that this was done as expeditiously as disorganized
arid scattered stockholders could do it, and agents be employed to investigate facts and counsel be consulted.
The defendants demurred. The demurrer was sustained
by the court below, and on appeal here the question now
was upon the correctness of its said judgment.
Mr. T. A. Hfendricks, for the appellant; Messrs. McDonald,
Roache, and Walker, contra.
Mr. Justice HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
We are of opinion that the judgment must be affirmed,
for two reasons:
1. Mr. Carlisle, the plaintiff in the suit in which the decree is sought to be vacated, is not a party to this proceeding. In the former suit all the forms of law, at least, were
complied with. The parties having interests which it was
sought to foreclose were made parties, a decree was taken
in the ordinary form that they be foreclosed and that the
property be sold. A sale was had. finder which the Present
defendants claim title. This was done' up6n the prayer o

HIARWOOD V. RAILROAD COMPANY.
Opinion of the court.

Mr. Carlisle, by his authority, and upon his procurement.
Third parties now come into court and ask that all these
proceedings, completed according to the forms of.law, and
sanctioned by the decree of, the court, taken at the request
of Mr. Carlisle and for which he is responsible, be vacated
and declared fraudulent and void. This is sought to be
done without his knowledge, and no opportunityis given to
him to sustain his decree or to rebut the alleged fraud, and
no reason or excuse is given why he is not made a party.
This is against authority and principle. No case is cited to
justify it, and it is believed that none can be found. The
judgments of courts of record would be scarcely worth obtaining if they could be thus lightly thrown aside. The absence of the plaintiff in the original suit is a fatal defect.*
2. We are of the opinion also that there has been too
great delay in initiating this suit, and that no sufficient excuse is given for it. The sale was made five years befcire
the commencement of this suit, and it is fairly to be inferred
from the bill that the plaintiffi were aware of the proceedings as they progressed. Their knowledge of the mortgage
sale is expressly admitted. The allegation of ignorance is,
in general terms, of the fraudulent acts and arrangements.
They do not allege when they acquired the knowledge, nor
give a satisfactory reason why it was not sooner obtained.
For aught that appears they have slept upon their knowledge
for several years. Without reference to any statute of limitations, the courts have adopted the principle that the delay
which will defeat a recovery must depeihd upon the particular circumstancees of each case. This case does not show a
sufficient degree of diligence to justify the overthrow of a
decree of foreclosure, under which new rights and interests

must necessarily have arisen.t
