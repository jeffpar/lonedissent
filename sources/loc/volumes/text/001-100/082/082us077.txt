to duty; but by the act of IMfarch 2d, 1867, these articles were
expressly exempted, and we think it would be too narrow a
construction to say that the castings were liable, the articles
themselves being exempt. This disposes of the first exception.
We think, as respects the second one, that there is no error
in the charge prejudicial to the defendants. Taxes illegally
assessed and paid may always be recovered back, if Vhe collector
understands from the payer that the taxes are regarded as illegal
and that suit will be instituted to compel the refunding of them.
The third exception is to the instruction, that if the jury
found for the plaintiff they might add interest. This was not
contested upon the argument, and we think it clearly correct.
The ground for the refusal to allow interest is the presumption
that the government is always ready and willing to pay its
ordinary debts. Where an illegal tax has been collected, the
citizen who has paid it, and has been obliged to bring suit
against the collector, is, we think, entitled to interest in the
event of recovery, from the time of the illegal exaction.

in case any of their lands are thrown open for sale the privilege to purchase them in limited quantities, at fixed prices, shall be first given to
parties who have settled upon and improved them. The legislation thus
adopted for the benefit of settlers was not intended to deprive Congress

ERRoR to the Supretne Court of California; the case being
thus:
On the 30th of June, 1864, Congress passed an act,* granting to the State of California the cleft, or gorge, in the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, situated in the county of Mariposa in
that State, known as the Yosemite Valley, with its branches
and spurs, in estimated length fifteen miles, and in width
one mile, with the stipulation that the State should accept
the grant upon the express condition that the premises
should be held for public use, resort, and recreation, and
should be inalienable for all time, except that leases for portions of the premises for periods not exceeding ten years
might be made, the income derived therefrom to be expended in the preservation and improvement of the premises, or the roads leading thereto. The act provided that
the boundaries of the grant should be established, at the
cost of the State, by the Surveyor-General of the United
States for California, whose official plat, when affirmed by
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, should constitute the evidence of the locus, extent, and limits of the
cleft, or gorge; and that the premises should be managed
by the governor of the State, with eight other commission* 13 Stat. at Large, 325.

ers to be appointed by him, who should receive no compensation for their services.
By the same act Congress also granted to the State the
tract of land embracing the grove of mammoth trees in
Mariposa, known as "the Mariposa Big Tree Grove," the
grant to be accepted upon similar conditions as the grant of
the Yosemite Valley, and the premises to be held for like
public use, resort, and recreation, and to be also inalienable
for all time, but with the same privilege as to leases.
At the first session of the legislature of California, subsequently held, an act was passed by which the State accepted
the grant thus made of the Yosemite Valley and Big Tree
Grove, upon "the conditions, reservations, and stipulations"
contained in the act of Congress, and the governor and eight
commissioners, who had previously been appointed by him
during the recess of the legislature, were constituted a board
of commissioners, "with full power to manage and administer the grant made, and the trust created by the act of
Congress," and to make rules and regulations for the government, improvement, and preservation of the premises.
The act also provided for the appointment by the commissioners of a guardian of the premises, and made it a penal
offence in any one to commit wilfully any trespass thereon,
to cut down or girdle the trees, to deface or injure the natural objects, to fire the wood or grass, or to destroy or injure
any bridge or structure thereon, or other improvement.
On the 19th of May, 1864, six weeks previous to the passage of the act of Congress making the grant to the State,
Hutchings entered the valley of the Yosemite and settled
upon lands therein, with the intention, according to his
declarations, and the findings of the court, to acquire the
title to the same under the pre-emption laws of the United
States. There were then on the premises a house, outhouses,
and a fence inclosing about three acres. These improvements Hutchings purchased of the previous occupant, and
he had ever since resided upon the premises, and had improved and cultivated them. The valley at the time was
unsurveyed, and no other acts than the settlement thus

made and continued had ever been done by him to acquire
the title, unless soliciting the State and Congress to recognize his claim can be called such acts. At the time of his
settlement, iutchings was possessed of all the qualifications
required of settlers under the pre-emption laws of the United
States.
The principal one of these laws, and the one to which all
subsequent acts refer, is the act of September 4th, 1841,*
entitled "An act to appropriate the proceeds of the sales of
the public lands, and to grant pre-emption rights." The
tenth section of this act provides that any person of the
class designated therein, who shall make a settlement upon
the public lands, to which the Indian title has been extinguished, and which has been previously surveyed, and shall inhabit and improve the same, and shall erect a dwelling
.thereon, shall be authorized to enter with the register of the
proper la'nd office, by legal subdivisions, one quarter section
of land, to include the residence or"the claimant, upon paying to the United States the minimum price of said land, subject to certain specified exceptions, among which is that no
lands included in any reservation by any treaty, law, or
proclamation of the President, or reserved for salines, or for
the support of schools, or for other purposes, shall be liable
to entry. By other sections various provisions are enacted
for the determination of conflicting claims, and the preservation of proofs of settlement and improvement. When all
the prerequisites are complied with, and the claimant has
paid the price of the land, he is entitled to a certificate of
entry from the register and receiver, and after a reasonable
time to enable the land officers to ascertain whether there
are any superior claims, and whether the claimant has complied, in all respects, with the law, he is entitled to a patent
of the United States.t

and for other purposes,"* all the public lands of the
United States in California, whether surveyed or unsurreyed, are
made, with certain exceptions, subject to the above act of
September 4th, 1841, "with all the exceptions, conditions,
and limitations therein," with a proviso that when unsulveyed lands are claimed by pre-emption notice of the claim
shall be filed within three months after the return of the
plats of surveys to the land offices, and proof and payment
shall be made prior to the day appointed by the President's
proclamation for the commencement of the sale including
such lands; the entry of such claims to be made by legal subdivisions according to the United States survey; and also
that settlement on unsurveyed lands shall be authorized only
where the settlement is made within one year after the passage of the act. This last limitation was subsequently extended by act of Congress two years from March 1st, 1854.t
In some of the States and Territories, by acts of Congress,
settlements are authorized on unsurveyed lands, and by the
7th section of the act of May 30th, 1862, "to reduce the expenses of the survey and sale of the public lands of the
United States,"I this privilege was extended to California.
Under this last act, Hutchings conceived that he had a
right to settle upon the unsurveyed lands of the United
States in the Yosemite Valley, and by the above acts of
1841 and 1853 could acquire and had acquired such a vested
interest in the premises, to the extent of one hundred and
sixty acres, that the United States could not transfer their
title to the State, or dedicate the land to any public use. He
therefore refused to surrender the possession to the commissioners appointed by the State. The defendant also refused to take a lease from the commissioners, though offered
to him at a mere nominal rate for ten years. They accordingly, in November, 1867, brought the present action, alleing in their complaint that the State was owner in fee of the
premises, and that they were entitled to the possession as
commissioners of the State.

THE YOSEMITE VALLEY CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the settler.

Pending the action, and on the 20th of February, 1868,
the legislature of California passed an act granting to the
defendant and one Lamon, each, one hundred and sixty acres
of land in the Yosemite Valley; the part granted to the defendant containing his improvements and the premises in
controversy. The second section of the act provided that
the act should take effect from and after its ratification by
Congress. It had never been thus ratified. A bill to ratify
it passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the
Senate.
The District Court of the State, in which the action was
commenced, adjudged that the defendant was right in his
view of his interest, and accordingly gave judgment in his
favor. The Supreme Court of the State reversed the judgment, and ordered judgment for the possession of the premises in favor of the commissioners. The defendant now
brought the case here for review.
Mr. G. T. Julian,for the plaintiff in error:
The question is, whether Congress, in granting the valley
to the State of California, could divest the right of Hutchings
under the pre-emption laws? In other words, had Hlutchings
such a vested right or interest, that Congress could not divest
it by the grant of it to another party ?
The case of Lytle v. The State of Arkansas* is in point.
There Cloyes, the pre-emptor, selected his claim under the
act of Congress of May 29th, 1830, authorizing and regulating
pre-emptions. A later act, dated June 15th, 1832, granted
to the Territory of Arkansas one thousand acres for a courthouse and jail at Little Rock, including the tract claimed.
Before this grant the pre-emption right of Cloyes had accrued
under the act of 1830, and he had proved his right, and done
everything he could do to perfect it. The court says:
"By this grant to Arkansas, Congress could not have intended
to impair vested rights. The grants of the one thousand acres

Argument for the settler.
and of the other tracts must be so construed as not to interfere
with the pre-emption of Cloyes."
This case is referred to in the case of Barnardv. Ashley.*
The court says:
"In Lytle's case we declared that the occupant was wrongfully deprived of his lawful rights of entry under the pre-emption
laws, and the title set up under the selection of the governor
of Arkansas was decreed to Cloyes, the claimant: this court
holding his claim to the land to have been a legal right by virtue
of the occupancy and cultivation, subject to be defeated only by
a failure to perform the conditions of making proof and tendering the purchase-money."
This, it will be seen, deals with the right of pre-emption
as "a legal right, by virtue of the occupancy and cultivation"
of the pre-emptor, "subject to be defeated only by a failure
to perform the conditions of making proof and tendering the
purchase-money."
The court adds:
"The claim of pre-emption is not that shadowy thing which
by some it is considered to be. Until sanctioned by law it has
no existence as a substantive right; but when covered by the
law, it becomes a legal right, subject to be defeated only by a
failure to perform the conditions annexed to it."
If this is true of Oloyes, it must be equally true of Hutchings, and he can only lose his claim "by a failure to perform
the conditions annexed to it," when those conditions shall
be tendered for his performance. In giving the opinion in
Lylle v. The State of Arkansas, the court says:
"The adventurous pioneer, who is found in advance of our
settlements, encounters many hardships, and not unfrequently
dangers from savage incursions. He is generally poor, and it is
fit that his enterprise should be rewarded by the privilege of
purchasing the favorite spot selected by him, not to exceed one
hundred and sixty acres. That this is the national feeling, is
shown by the course of legislation for many years."
* 18 Howard, 43.

84

THE YOSEMITE VALLEY CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the settler.

This expresses the spirit and policy of the pre-emption
laws, as they have been understood by the whole country
till quite recently. The pioneer settler has been treated as
the favorite of the law. The court says further:
"It is a well-established principle, that when an individual,
in the prosecution of a right, does everything which the law
requires him to do, and he fails to attain his right by the misconduct or neglect of a public officer, the law will protect him.
In this case the pre-emptive right of Cloyes having been proved,
and an'offer to pay the money for the land claimed by him, under
the act of 1830, nothing more could be done by him, and nothing
more could be required of him under that act. And subsequently,
when he paid the money to the receiver, under subsequent acts,

the surveys being returned, he could do nothing more than offer
to enter the land, which the register would not permit him to do.
This claim of pre-emption stands before us in a light not less favorable than it would hdve stood if Oloyes or his representatives
had been permitted by the land officers to do what, in this respect, was offered to be done."
Cloyes was held excused, on the ground that he had done
everything in his power to perfbet his claim. Hatchings
did the same. Cloyes had gone further in complying with
the conditions of title than Hutchings has done, but each
went as far as he could, and neither was in default. The
good faith of the government is involved in both cases.
There is no justice in the argument that the pre-emptor,
after having made valuable improvements, and expended his
money thereon, and complied with all the conditions of title
which were within his power, may nevertheless be driven
from his possession, his improvements confiscated, and the
land conveyed to another, with notice of all the facts, who
can hold it discharged from all the equities of the preemptor.
It is conceded on all hands, that if a pre-emptor, in addition to the other acts required of him, has paid for the land,
he has acquired a vested right -to it, and the government is
bound to give him the title; but this concession yields the
whole case. If the government is bound by its good faith

THE YOSEMITE VALLEY

CASE.

Argument for the settler.

to protect the settler at one stage of his claim, and as to one
condition of title, it is bound to protect him at all stages,
and as to every condition. The condition of final payment
is no more vital or sacred, either to the settler or the government, than any of those which precede it. In the language already quoted, "it is fit that his enterprise should
be rewarded by the privilege of purchasing the favorite spot
selected by him, not to exceed one hundred and sixty
acres;" but of what value is this "privilege," if the settler
holds it at the mere will of the government, which may cut
it off at any moment? And what must be thought of a government which holds its individual citizens to perfect good
faith, by compelling them to perform their engagements,
and yet violates its own faith to the settler, that he should
have a home on its lands on specified conditions, with which
he is ready and willing to comply? Nor is this question
answered by saying that the settler has the option to abandon
his pre-emption at any time, and that the government, therefbre, should be equally free. The option of the pre-emptor
is properly given by the law; for if he abandons his claim,
the land, with the improvements made upon it, reverts to
the government, which loses nothing. The transaction has
been likened to a contract for the sale of lands, in which the
owner retains the title as security for the purchase-money.
On the other hand, if the settler, after spending his money
and his time in improving his pre-emption, and making for
himself a home, as in the present case, is driven away by
the government, without any default on his part, he loses all
unjustly, and is without remedy.
This case of Lytle v. T/e State of Arkansas deserves particular regard, not only because the principles laid down in
it settle the case under consideration in favor of Hutchings,
but because it sustains the true land policy of the nation, as
universally understood, till within a very recent period.
The counsel ou the other side will rely on Prisbie v.
Whitaey;* the only authority of any Federal court which

can be cited in favor of the doctrine now set up as to the
rights of settlers under the pre-emption laws. The case is
in the face of the explicit language of the court in the case
of Lytle v. The State of Arkansas, of which, however, it takes
no notice. It is against the current of authorities on the
question in the Federal courts, and against the whole spirit
and policy of our land laws. It refers to the different sections of the pre-emption act of 1841, but takes no notice of
the judicial constructions of the act in favor of the rights of
the settler under that act. It cites in support of the points
affirmed sundry opinions of attorneys-general and decisions of State courts, which at best are not binding and conclusive authorities in this court; while it fails to discuss or
scarcely to refer to the strong cases decided in the Federal
courts in favor of an opposite interpretation of the right of
pre-emption.
The facts also of the case of Whitney v. Frisbie are peculiar.; and the claim of Hutchings cannot be held as conclusively settled adversely, to our view, by that single case.
r. B L. Goold, contra.
Mr. Justice FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the
opinion of the court, as follows:
The simple question presented for determination is whether
a party, by mere settlement upon lands of the United States,
with a declared intention to obtain a title to the same under
the pre-emption laws, does thereby acquire such a vested interest in the premises as to deprive Congress of the power
to divest it by a grant to another party. If such be the effect
of mere settlement, with a view to pre-emption, upon the
power of Congress to grant the lands occupied to another
party, it must operate equally to deprive Congress of the
power to reserve such lands from sale for public uses of the
United States, though needed for arsenals, fortifications,
lighthouses, hospitals, custom-houses, court-bouses, or fbr
any other of the numerous public purposes for which property is used by the government. It would require very clear

87

Opinion of the court.

language in the acts of Congress before any intention thus
to place the public lands of the United States beyond its
control by mere settlement of a party, with a declared intention to purchase, could be attributed to its legislation.
The question here presented was before this court, and
was carefully considered, in the case of Frisbie v. Whitney,
reported in the 9th of Wallace. And it was there held that
under the pre-emption laws mere occupation and improvement of any portion of the public lands of the United States,
with a view to pre-emption, do not confer upon the settler
any right in the land occupied, as against the United States, or
impair in any respect the power of Congress to dispose of
the land in any way it may deem proper; and that the power
of regulation and disposition, conferred upon Congress by
the Constitution, only ceases when all the preliminary acts
prescribed by those laws for the acquisition of the title, includiig the payment of the price of the land, have been performed by the settler. When these prerequisites have been
complied with, the settler for the first time acquires a vested
interest in the premises occupied by him, of which he cannot be subsequently deprived. He is then entitled to a certificate of entry from the local land officers, and 'ultimately
to a patent for the land from the United States. Until such
payment and entry the acts of Congress give to the settler
only a privilege of pre-emption in case the lands are offered
for sale in the usual manner; that is, the privilege to purchase them in that event in preference to others. The
United States by those acts enter into no contract with the
settler, and incur no obligation to any one that the land
occupied by him shall ever be put up for sale. They simply
declare that in case any of their lands are thrown open for
sale the privilege to purchase them in limited quantities, at
fixed prices, shall be first given to parties who have settled
upon and improved them. The legislation thus adopted for
the benefit of settlers was not intended to deprive Congress
of the power to make any other disposition of the lands before they are offered for sale, or to appropriate them to any
public use.

THE YoSEMIITE VALLEY CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

The decision in Frisbie v. Whitney was pronounced by a
unanimous court, and subsequent reflection has satisfied us
of its entire soundness. The construction there given to
the pre-emption laws is, as there stated, in accordance with
the construction uniformly given by that department of the
government, to which the administration of the land laws is
confided, and by the chief law officers of the government to
whom that department has applied for advice on the subject.
It is the only construction which preserves a wise control in
the government over the public lands, and prevents a general spoliation of them under the pretence of intended settlement and pre-emption. The settler being under no obligation to continue his settlement and acquire the title, would
find the doctrine advanced by the defendant, if it could be
maintained, that he was possessed by his settlement of an
interest beyond the control of the government, a convenient
protection fbr any trespass and waste, in the destruction of
timber or removal of ores, which he might think proper to
commit during his occupation of the premises.
The argument of the defendant's counsel, and his criticism
upon the decision in Frisbiev. Whitney are founded upon a
misapprehension of the language used in some previous
opinions of this court, and particularly of language used in
the opinion in the case of Lytle v. The State of Arkansas.*
This last case and the language there used did not escape
the attention of the court in the consideration of Frisbie v.
Whitney. That and other cases, in which the equitable
rights of persons claiming under the pre-emption laws had
been protected against the legal title acquired by others in
disregard of their rights, were cited by counsel and commented upon on the argument, as asserting principles inconsistent with the construction of those laws given by the
court. But the court, without examining in the opinion the
cases cited in detail, stated that in nearly all of them the
party, whose equitable right was protected, had acquired a
vested right by action of the land officers, and payment and

Opinion of the court.

acceptance of the price of the land, which those officers had
disregarded; and that in the other cases the successful party
had established his legal right of preference of purchase
over others under existing law; and that in these particulars those cases were widely different from that of Frisbie
v. Whitney.
But inasmuch as counsel of the defendant,* who appeared
also as one of the counsel in this last case, again urges upon
our attention the case of Lytle v. Arkansas, and contends
with much earnestness that it sustains principles in conflict
with those expressed in Frisbie v. Whitney, and also settles
the case at bar in favor of the defendant, we are induced to
state at some length what that case was, and what it actually
decided. In that case a pre-emptioner by the name of
Cloyes claimed a right to make an entry of certain lands
under the act of Congress of May 29th, 1830. That act
gave t o every occupant of the public lands prior to its date,
who had cultivated any part thereof in the year 1829, a right
to enter at the minimum price, by legal subdivisions, any
number of acres not exceeding one hundred and sixty, including his improvements, provided the land was not reserved for the use of the United States, or either of the
several States. It required, before any entries could be
made, that proof of settlement or improvement by the
claimant should be made to the satisfaction of the register
and receiver of the land district, pursuant to rules prescribed
by the Commissioner of the General Land Ofice. Under
rules thus prescribed proof was made of the cultivation and
improvement of Cloyes which was satisfactory to the register
and receiver, and payment of the price was offered by him.
Those officers held that he was entitled to enter one of
the fractional sections claimed, the one upon which his
improvement was made and not the others, and issued a certificate to him to that effect. The plats of the township
Mr. Julian's name was printed as one of the counsel to the brief filed
for the defendant in Frisbie v. Whitney, though his name is not given in the
report of the case in 9th Wallace, he not having participated in the oral argument.-ItEP.

90

THE YOSEMITE VALLEY CASE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

where the land was situated not having been furnished by
the surveyor-general, as required, the formal entry with the
register could not be made, but in lieu thereof, under instructions of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
proof identifying the land claimed was allowed to be filed.
The act of 1830 expired in one year, and the public surveys
of the land were not completed until December, 1833, and
were not returned to the land office until the beginning of
1834. Cloyes had thus done all that he could do to perfect
his right to the title of the United States under a law which
opened the land for sale in limited quantities, at specified
prices, to its occupants and cultivators.
Subsequently, in July, 1832, Congress passed an act giving
to parties entitled to pre-emption under the act of 1830 one
year from the time when the township plats should be returned, to enter the lands. Under this act the heirs of Cloyes,
he having died, made payment to the receiver for the fractional section to which his pre-emption claim was allowed in
1830, as already stated, and also for tho fractionalsections to
which his claim was rejected, and applied to the register to
enter them, but that officer refused to allow the entry. The
court held that, so far as the fractional quarter section to
which the claim was allowed by the register and receiver in
1830 was concerned, the refusal did not affect the right of
the claimant. And it is with respect to the inability of Cloyes
to make the entry in 1830 fir want of the township plats
which the surveyor-general had failed to return, and the
refusal of the register to allow the entry subsequently under
the act of 1832, that the language cited by counsel was used
by the court; namely, that, "It is a well-established principle
that when an individual, in the prosecution of a right, does
everything which the law requires him to do, and he fails to
attain his right by the misconduct or neglect of a public
officer, the law will protect him. In this case the pre-emption
right of Cloyes having been proved, and an offer to pay the
money for the land claimed by him, under the act of 1830,
nothing more could be done by him, and nothing more could
be required of him under that act. And subsequently, when

Opinion of the court.

he paid the money to the receiver, under subsequent acts,
the surveys being returned, he could do nothing more than
to offer to enter the land, which the register would not permit
him to do. This claim for pre-emption stands before us in
a light not less favorable than it would if Cloyes or his representatives had been permitted by the land officers to do
what in this respect was offered to be done."
There is no question about the correctness of the doctrine
here announced; it is only a familiar principle which is stated,
that where one offers to do everything upon which the acquisition of a right depends, and is prevented by fault of the
other side, his right shall not be lost by his failure.
The principle only applies where, by law or contract, the
acquisition of a right is made dependent upon the performance of certain specified act5. There can be no such thing
as the acquisition of a right of pre-emption, that is of a right
to be preferred in the purchase of property of the United
States, until such property is open for sale. In the case from
Arkansas the law of 1830 authorized the entry and sale of
the land to the occupants and cultivators; it prescribed certain things to be done to entitle them to purchase; these
things were done, or would have been done by Cloyes if the
officers of the government, appointed to aid in their performance, had not failed in their duty. The hindrance to the
complete performance of everything required of the claimant
could not impair his rights. And it was immediately after
affirming the validity of his claim, notwithstanding this hindrance, that the court used the language upon which so much
stress is placed by the defendant's counsel, to the effect that
a claim of pre-emption is not a "shadowy right," but when
covered by the law is a legal right, subject to be defeated
only by a failure to perform the conditions annexed to it.
This language was undoubtedly correct as applied to the
claim of Cloyes, as then situated, which gave occasion to-it,
and it is in a general sense correct as applied to every claim
of pre-emption. Such claim, it must be remembered, is only
a claim to be preferred in the purchase of lands of the United
States in limited quantities, at fixed prices, when the lands

Opinion of the court.

are offered for sale in the usual manner. When one has acquired this claim by complying with the conditions of the
law for its acquisition he has a legal right to be thus preferred,
when the sale is made, as against others asserting a similar
right under the law, which the court will enforce in proper
cases. But the claim of pre-emption, as already said, can
never arise when the law does not provide for a sale of the
property. Until thus sanctioned by the law the claim, as
stated by the court in that case, has no existence as a substantive right.
There is nothing in the case of the defendant which is at
all analogous to that of Cloyes. Here the land occupied by
the defendant was never offered for sale, but was excluded
from any possible sale by appropriation to perpetual public
use, resort, and recreation. NTthing was therefore required
or could be required of the defendant for the acquisition of
the title, and nothing could be, orwas done by him to that end.
In the case from Arkansas, the right of Cloyes had been
defeated by the failure of the executive officers to perform
their duty under the law, he having complied fully with its
provisions, except so far as he was prevented by such failur~e,
and having thus acquired a right to the title of the government. In the present case no default on the part of the executive officers is alleged or pretended. The ground of
complaint is that the defendant could not acquire the title
under the pre-emption laws, because Congress had granted
the land to the State and thus withdrawn it from sale. In
the one case it is the action of the executive officers which
is the ground of complaint; in the other it is the action of
Congress.
The court cannot assume, and then found a decree upon
the truth of the assumption, that the defendant would have
complied with the provisions of the pre-enmption laws, had
Congress never made the grant. Nor could it make any
such assumption, even if it were held that those laws surrendered unconditionally the entire public lands to settlers,
instead of allowing to them the privilege of pre-emptibii provided the lands are offered for sale in the usual manner.

Dee. 1872.]

THE

YOSEMITE VALLEY CASE.
Opinion of the court.

In June, 1832, Congress passed an act granting to the Territory of Arkansas one thousand acres of land contiguous to
and adjoining the town of Little Rock, for the erection of a
court-house and jail. The grant was not of any specific tract,
but only of a specified quantity to be selected by the governor.
Previous to the selection by him and previous to the grant,
Cloyes had acquired a right, as already stated, to the title of
the government. This was a vested right, and the court very
properly held that Congress, in making the grant to Arkansas, did not intend to impair vested rights, and that the grant
must be so construed as not to interfere with the pre-emption
of Cloyes. No other ruling would have been consistent with
settled principles. Had the lands in the Yosemite Valley
been open for sale, and had Hutchings acquired a right to
the title of the United States.by complying with all the conditions upon which the acquisition of that title depended before the grant to the State, his position would have some
analogy to that of Cloyes. His right to the title would then
have been a vested right, and the grant to the State would
have been construed so as not to interfere with his pre-emption. But his declarations as to what he would have done
had the land not been withdrawn by Congress from the
operation of the pre-emption laws, are unavailing for any
purpose.
The case of Lytle v. Arkansas is confessedly the strongest
case which counsel can cite in support of the anomalous
views advanced by him. It is manifest from the statement
we have made of the facts of that case, that neither the case
itself nor the language used in the opinion of the court, when
considered in connection with the facts, give the slightest
countenance to those views; but that the decision of the
court and the doctrines expressed in the opinion, are in entire harmony with the principles announced in .risbie v.
Whitney. The whole difficulty in the argument of the defendant's counsel arises from his confounding the distinction
made in all the cases, whenever necessary for their decision,
between the acquisition by the settler of a legal r qht to the
land occupied by him as against the owner, the United States;

CANAL COMPANY v. HILL.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

and the -acquisition by him of a legal right as against other
parties to be preferred in its purchase, when the United States
have determined to sell. It seems to us little less than absurd
to say that a settler or any other person by acquiring a right
to be preferred in the purchase of property, provided a sale
is made by the owner, thereby acquires a right to compel
the owner to sell, or such an interest in the property as to
deprive the owner of the power to control its disposition.
The act of California, of February, 1868, attempting to
grant the premises in controversy to the defendant is, by its
own terms, inoperative until ratified by Congress. No such
ratification has ever been made, and it is not believed that
Congress will ever sanction such a perversion of the trust
solemnly accepted by the State.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

CANAL COMPANY V. HILL.
1. To ascertain the intent of the parties is the fundamental rule in the construction of agreements. When the substantial thing which they have
in view can be gathered from the whole instrument, it will control mere
formal provisions, which are intended only as a means of attaining the
substance.
2. The state of things and surrounding -circumstances in which an agreement is made will be looked at as a means of throwing liqht upon its
meaning, especially for the purpose of ascertaining what is its true subject-matter.
3. A grant of a right to draw from a canal so much water as will pass
through an aperture of given size and given position in the side of the
canal is substantially a grant of a right to take a certain quantity of
water in bulk or weight. What that quantity is may be ascertained
from the character and depth of the canal, the circumstances under
which the water is to be drawn, and the state of things existing at the
time the grant is made.
4. The grantee will be entitled to draw this quantity even though it may be
necessary to have the aperture enlarged, if it can be done without injury
to the grantor.
