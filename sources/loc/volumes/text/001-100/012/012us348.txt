accompanied by two letters dated the 15th and 16th of
July, signed William Graham and brothers, the first
addressed to Messrs. Johh Graham & Co. and the lst
to Messra. Peter Grahani' & Co. The letter to John

The letter to Peter Graham_& Co. is also a general
letter on the subject of their trade. It contains the
following passage respecting the shipments by the Frances: , We have shipped by Frances a few goods well
" selected-we could not get almost any cluster seeds."
The Circuit Judge directed the cause- to stand for
further proof.
It appears from the affidavit of John Graham, that
in the month of January, in the year 1809, he entered
ihito a limited partnership with his brothers, William
Graham and Peter Graham, who, as well as himself,
are naturalized citizens of the United States. The business was to be conducted at New York by himself.

deptanent, together with the management of !h. inercantile concerits of the firms co)mp,)sd as aforesaid,

and the commissifn busitivss. were the principal if not
the s,.de business of William Graham and brothers at
Glasgow. Thac, from the intimate knowlede they possess,:d of each othrs aflairs. and in conseqn-.unce of tt~eir
connexion as brothers, the (jistinction between his firm
and his priva.e character was not v,1ways preserved. It
was the less attended to, because the affairs of the company ann his individual concerns were frequently the
subjects o, the same looter, and it became the miore usual
to address him by the style of the firm, because there

are several othei

persons of the same name in New

,York.
le adds, that in making shil)nrncs on the sole
account of the deponent, William Graham has been in
the habit of asso'ting the whole into invoices of small
quantties, calculated to suit the generality of pur,'hasers in the New York market, and also tlhat the goods in
any one of the said invoices niight be sold entire, or transshipped to Philadelphia or any other market, with the
original invoi . acompanying the same, as such original in-oice would inspire more cbnfidence in the buyers. This circuinstance occasioned the lists of property
,hiipled by the Frances, and one of them to be addressed
to Peter Graham and Co. He swears in the m,)st positive and prtcise terms, thlat the prop-rty is entirely his
own, and was purchased with his private fluds in the
hands of William Graham.
William Black deposes, that he has been long and intimately acqiuainted with John Graham, who is a man
of fortutne and character, and has been in the habit of
transacting much of his own business in the said Graham's counting house: That, from his knowledge of the
affairs of the said Graham, he verily believes that the
said Graham, both before aid since the war, has been
in the habit of doing business on 'As private account,
and has received many sliipmentg in which neithr of
his brothers were interestpd. lie has been concerned
with the deponent as part owner of vessels in wich the
deponent beli.vs that. neither William nor Peter Graham.ield any share.

John Graham has been in the habit of transacting busi
ness on his own account, with the knowledge of his
partniers, and has frequently comlsigned his separate

goods to Peter Graham & Co.
William N. Steele, clerk of Peter Graham, deposes
to the same facts; and founids his belief that Peter Graham had. no interest in the goods shipped by the Frances, on his ktiowledge of the business of the house.
Wiiliam Grabam states in detail, with great explicitness, the circumstances narrated in the affidavits of
John Graham and of William Hill, his principal clerk,
and avers most solemnly that tme goods shiplicd by the
Frances were the sole property of John Graham.
The Court below directed restitution of two thirds
of tie. cargo, as- bein. the property of John and JPeter
Graham, and condemned one thi d, a-s being the prperty
of William Graham. From this sentence of condenmalion .ohn Graham has appealed ; and from so much of
the sentence as directs a restitution of one third as the
property of Peter Graham, the captors have appealed.
It is certainly a rule in prize Courts dictated by g{:od
sense. and calculated to promote the purposes of justice,
that letters accompanying the cargo, written in good
faith, in the prosecution of a fair and honie t business,
s1ouhl( have great influence in ascertaining the. real
proprietors of it. The Ittters on board the Frances
are of this description. They are such as would be
written if the goods were really the property of' the
company; but such as could scarcel have been written
if tl.goods were the s:de 1)roperty of John Graham.
Had tley been his sole property, it must have happened
that son.e expression would have b1ien found in the letters indicating the fact. Men who write carelessly a'id
without design. may imot Ie very explicit ; but it rarely
happens that they entirely conceal the truth. There
,%ill be some allusion to it.
If the goods were the sale properly of John Graham,

The affidavits produced on the ,z'dr for further
proof, are too positive to be disr.garded without consi(lerable relu'tance and hesitation. Th re are, however,
certain riles of (.vidence, the autiorith of which is ad'.
initted in all'Coui't-. One of dhese iÂ§. that if a writteu
paper be re'frrrd to, which paper is in the l)oNer of the.
party, it ought to be produced. The affidavits of William Graham and of N il tam Hill slate ,-xpressly that
lett.rs had been received from Jolm Graham, directinlg
the (lisp .sitioni ofcargoes shipIed from A3neri:a on his
own acount, and ordering the procee!s to be invested
in Britisha ina-anuactures, also on his own account, so
soon as the Briish orders in council should be rep, aled.
Why are nt these letters l)roduced ? It is ifl)ssbhe notr
toperceive their necessity. Mr. Jihn Grahanm s have
copied these letters into his letter book. Why has he
not furnished some eviden, e of this fact. His letters
must have been answered by William Graham moro
explicitly than in that which was fund on board the
Frances. Why is n,) one of those letters produiced ? It
is imp,,ssible to account for the fact that no one of these
letters is an exhibit in the cause. The Cout feels itself
bound, judging on this evidence according to the ruals
of law, to consider the goods as the property of the
company. But it is urged, on the part of the Claimant,
that if permitted to give further proof, lie will prlduce
the correspondence and.such other proof as %'ill he entirely saiisfactory to the Court. Several ,ircnn,:stanres
exist iii this cause to induce the Court to allow sfill
further time for the production of such further evidence
as may place the transaction be,,ond any doubt. The
cause is ordered to stand for firther proof,
