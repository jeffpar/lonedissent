To ascertain the national character of the Claimant
further proof was ordered by the Court beiow, calling
upon l:in to show hov. long, after his naturalization., lie
resided in the United States, before lie went to Great
Britain ; how long he had since resided in the United

Upon the production of this further proof, it appeared
that the property was vested in the Claimant at the time
of its being shipped ; that he was a native (f Great Britain ; that he emigrated to the United States in 1793 ;
was naturalized in 1798 ; having, in the interim, returned to his native country on mercantile business in

ti'ned to Glasgow in the same year, where lie carried

on the bu'iuess of the partnership under the firm of
Colin Gillespie & Co.; that he remained there until
the partnership was dissolved, and until the 2d of July,
1813 ; on which day he left the eneiny's country, and
arrived in the United States with his family. in October, 1815 ; that le kept house at Glasgow, and built a
ware-house there, which lie still owns. and kept his
counting house therein. He formed a deterininalion to
return to the Unitel States, as lie deposes, on being
informed of the declaration of war by the United States
against Great Britain, wiich took place on the 18th of
June, 181s. anl was known in England about the 20th
of July following, but was prevented, by his engagements and commercial concerns, from carrying that
intention into effect ,:ntil the period above mentioned,
still leaving some of his affairs unarranged.
Upon this evidence, the property was condemned in
the Circuit Court ; and an appeal was taken. by ie
Claimant, to this Court, where the cause was argued
by JoNEs. HtrERu, and DuXTEr, for the Claimant;
and rINKNEY for the captors.
Jox.Es, ffr the Claimant.

The goods in question were purchased early in .3uly,
181. they wor,: shipped on the ith of that r:rnuth. at
which time the declaratifan of war was not known in
England. It does not .pp-ar that th' Claimant shipped
any other goods than thosv in (question. Iii lcs than
a y 'ar after he had received information of the war, lie
returned to the United States with his family, thereby
g'ving unequivocal evidenre of the quo animo of his residence in Great Britain. In such a case, even the property of a neutral would be protected; afortiori, ought
the property of one of our own citizens to receive protection. -Cases of this kind are analogous to cases of
confiscation. If there be any particular period at which

FEBRUARY TERM 18A.
we can consider this property as assuming a hostile Tn
character, it must be that, at which it would have lbeen FRANCES,

tel, B. 3, see. 63.
This ease may be considered 'n another point of view,
viz : whether the case of a naturalized citizen returning to his native country, and carrying on trade. as in
present case, is distinguishable in its consequences,
tit.
in the event of war, from that of a native citizen going
to a foreign country and engaging in trade. We coutend that it is not. One authority, and one only, seems
to favor tle distinction ; and that is the case of La Virginia. 5 Rob. 99. But in that case. it does not appear
that the Am*irican character of Mr. Lapierre was acquired by naturalization. It might and very probably
did depend on donicil alone. We contend that a person
naturalized in this country, is as much a citizen of the
Uinited States, to all the intents, and purposes of th6
preseut case, as a native. The naturalization law of
the United Stateg requires of the applicant for the privileges of naturalization, unqualified abjuration of allegianc,, to his folrmer sovereign. The law of England
on the subject goes to an equal extent. Naturalized
and native subjects are looked upon as the same, to all
legal purposes. 4 Cranch, 321. Dawson'sLessee v.
Godfrey.
A denizen may be made such for life or in tail; "bit
one cannot be naturalized either with limitatiofi, for
life or in tail, or upon condition; for that is against flib
absolutenesq, purity and indebility of natufal Alegiance." Co. Lit. 129, (a.) 2 Domat, 376.

If, according to the doctrine of perpetual allegiance,
on the return of a naturalized citizen to Iis native
country, his former duties return, and his duties to his
adopted country still continue, under what contradictory obligations would he be placed. This was lord Hale's
doctrine, but it is now done away. Foster's Crown Law,
185, sec. 1.

SUPREME COURT U. S.
THE
XMANCES,

It has been decided in England, in the case of Jfarryat
V. Wilion, I Bos. and Pud. 430, that a natural born sub-

(GXLLu-:S- jVCt of that country admitted a citizen of the United
riEs States of America, either before or after the declaration

HARnPER, same side,
Asked whether the Court, in the case of the Rapid,
had decided the question ai to the difference b(eteen
the British acts concerning letters of marque, prizes
and prize goods, which authorize the, capture of the
property of inhabitaits in hostile countries (and on
which the British admiralty decisions are founded.) and
the act of congress declaring war, which only gives a
right to capture the property of British subjects.
Jonnsoi, J. said the Court had fully considered that
point and decided it in the case of the Rapid.
PINKNEY, for

the captors.

We contend that the property even of a nathre American citizen domiriled in an enemy country at tle time
of the capture of such property, is liable to condemnation
as prize of war; and, a fortiori the property of a naturakzed American citizen, a native of the enemy country, tnder like circumstances ; which isthe case before
the Court, and which will be first considered.
It has been contended on the other side, that a person naturalized in the, United States is as much a citizen of this country as a native, and that he continues to
be so, though he return to his native country and there
engage in trade. It has been argued that, in order to
become an American citizen, he must abjure his allegiance to his former government, that, consequently,
though he should return to his native countiy, lie can
no longer be considered as under the protection of that
government: that his new allegiance to the United
States continues, and that our'government is bound to
protect him: that he is therefore to be considered in the

EBRUARY TERM i8s4same light as a native'citizen, and that his property is
equally to be plotected in case of war.
That a person so abjuring his native allegiance cannot claim protection from his former government, while
he cbntinues in the country of his adoption, is admitted ;
but we contend that if lie voluntarily, returns within the
sphere of his original allegiance, lie is as much a subject ot his former government as if he haj never emigrated ; that the reciprocal duties of allegiance and
protection, on the respective parts of the subject and
the sovereign, are revived: lie is no longer a citizen
of the United States. The two allegiances are ificoinpatible, we admit; the naturalization law of the United
States clearly goes upon this idea; but-in case of the
party's return to his native country, it is the old allegiance which must prevail, and not the new, as is contended by the Claimant. By his return, lie has, in fact,
consented to resume his former alle!giance: for lie must
be presumed to have known the laws of his country, and
that those laws would impose upon him his ol dutivs in
case of his return. He is now, as sir W. Scott would
call him. a redintgqrated subject of his native country,
and is liable to all his fl'omer obligations. He is now
bound actively to support the government to which lie
has returned. In cas.' of war, lie may be compelled to
take up arms against the country he has a lopted ; to
pay taxes for the support of the war. &c. and this, not
by arbitrary power, but of right. Tiehiese obligations,
it will be recollected, we -ontend are the eI'tct of a
-voluntary!return. We do not mean to say that if a naturalized citizen should enter the army of the United
St atos and be captured by the nation to which lie lormerly belonged, during a war between the two countries,
lie would, on being carried to his native country as a
prisoner, incur those obligations. Bit in the case now
before the Court, the return of Gillespie, the Claimant,
to England, was entirely voluntary. Without regardl.
therefore, to the question of domicil, Gilhopie was, according to the doctrine for which we have been contending, politically an enemy of the United States, at the
time of the capture of the Frances. If lie was not an
enemy, I should be glad to know who can be considered ai such. If he is not hostis, who has every hostile
duty upon him, I am at a loss to know who is.

BOYER,
MASTER.

Thk counsel for the Claimanf has cited lord Coke in
support of his doctrine of naturalization, but does not
seem to have considered that, according to that author,
a British subject can never become a citizen of any
other'. country.
The case of'iarfryatv-. filson has al.5obeencited. That
case is perhaps entitled' to some consideration but
even there, the Court had. at first, decided against Collet. and it was only upon the r, quest of the American
minister (Mr. King) that they consented to re-consider
the c ase, when they finally decided in his favor.
2. If Gillespie was politically an enemy, at the time
of the capture, the doctrine or commercial domicil is
wholly immaterial in the preseht case. But as the Court
may not view the sulject in the same light as we do,
a few remarks on the latter point may not be unnecessary.'
We lay it down then, as an indisputed position, that
the character of captured goods is decided by the commercial domicil of te'owner at the time of capture.
And we contend that Gillespie had a commercial domicil in Great Britain,. at the time of the capture of the
goods in question. It does not appear that lie had, in
any manner, put himself in motion-in iti,,re, to return before the capture. All the evidence showing his
intention to return, arose after that event. A hostile
character, therefore, attached to the property, if not to
the owner.
This is not a case of withdrawing funds : it is a case
of trade originating before the war, and continued after
the war. Besides, the rule of withdrawal appliei only
to cases where the domicil of the party is not in the
enemy country, though his trade is carried on and his
property situated there. See Coopinan's case, cited in
the Vigilantla, I Bob. 12, 11. Escot's case, cited in the

We might admit, perhaps, that by a return to his native country in time of war, lie must he considered as

incompatible with those lie owed to this country. He
assumed only that tenporary allegiance to the governmeat of Great Britain, which every other strauger in
that country owed. Upon the breaking out of the war,
perhaps new duties might arise mncoisistent with hi
duties as an Ameri,'an citizen. Yet, in that case, a reasonable time ought to be allowed him to remove ; and
