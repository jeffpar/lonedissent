The cause was heirtl in tie Circuit Court upon the
bill, anwers, depositions and other proofs. The Court
decreed tlhe bill to be dismissed with costs; from which
decree an appeal was taken to this Court.
TAYLOn,for the .1ppelants.
On examination of the evidence exhibited, we are satisfie,l,
that the allegation, that the assignment was, made during the minority of Mary Frazer is not sufficiently supported to have authorized the Circuit Court to have decreed a re-conveyance. But we suppose the Complianants were entitled to relief in some shape for the surplus
lan1 contained within the snrvey ; either by a decree for
the re-conveyance of the surplus. by a p',cuniary compensation for it according to it- present value or by a pecuniary coRipensation according to the price at which the
land was sold, on which interest should be allowed.
No evidence is introduced of the terms of the sale,
'whether by the acre or in gross, except the survey, assignment, power of attorney and receipt before mentioned, from these it plainly appears that the parties contracted on a supposition that the quantity'of land sold
and purchased was 2000 acres.
The surplus of 700 acres (nearly one third of the
w'hole quantity supposed to he sold) cniot be considered as a small one, such as might arise from inaccuracy
ofinstrmentns, &c. and therecore within the contemplation of the parties.
The remote residence of the vendor, who had hut late.
ly attained full age when she sold, precludes the idea of
her having any information of the quantity of land to
which she was entitled, other than that which was deiived from the survey. On her part, therefire, and prohably on the part of the purchaser also, the contract was

made tnder an evident mistake respecting the subject of
sale. "Pm.re is nothing" discoverable, in thr contract or
exhibits from whirh it can be. collected that the sal was
made without resp,)nQibility for the quantity,, the words,
nwre or less, almost universally used to designate such
an intent, are no where to be found.
The case presented is that 9f a contract made under
the itl ta e of inistake, inboth parties, as to a material
and importent part, without fraud or concealment on
eithr side.
Itis supposed that no difference exists between contracts- lor the s.le of lanis, and those of any other description. Tihe s.me principles apply to all. This doe.
trine is reco.nized in the opinion expressed by the
Court of appeals in Kentucky, in the case of Young
aganlst Craig. In delivering that opini,,n the Court
expressre itself as follows: ,,The q jestion in this
case is whether Craig who had sold to Young a tract
of-and" containing in its botindaries a surplus, has
a right to recover such surplus, or incase it cannot be
had, a compensation therefor in money. There is no
novelty or pecliarity in the principles upon which
questions of this s.ort depend. In contracts of this
kind the same good faith- i3 reqtired, and the same
responsibility attaches to its violation, which law and
reason priseribes in every description of contracts. If,
thrwigh frauid or gross and palpable mistake, wore or
less land should be conveycd than was in the contemplation of the seller t)part with. or the purchaser to receive, the inijured paty wo.uld be entitled to relief in
like manner as he wbuld be for an injury produced by
a similar cause in a contract of any other species."
The same opinion also establishes the principle that in
sales in graqs as -.v,ll as in sales by the acre, if the parties have contracted under manifest error as t quantity,
the party injn.ed is entitlel to relief, unless indeed, the
surplus or d,,ivit wAs sjnall, not more than usual in such
cases, and of course supposed to be within the contemplation of the parties. In that case it is true the Comrt

On these principles as applied to this case the Complainants would be entitled to compensation, or the contract Niould be considered as void, unless it was in proof
that the surplus was not unusually gr(ert. and was not

by writers on natural law, it would appear that the error of the parties rather afforded a groun1 for a decree
of compensation than for annulling the contract.

will clearly apppar that the parties contracted under an
opinion that the survey conotined only two thousand
acres, the survey itself specifies that quantity. The

either side to make, a risking bargain.
No eidence appears in the record to shew that military surveys do usually contain swpliis lands, and it is
suppised without such proof the Court cannot take judicial notice of such an allegation.
But if the Court should reco.-nize it. must it not also
be admitted th4t the surplus in this case (one third) is
much more than is usual. The.influence of error on the
contracting parties being proved, it lies on the Defendants to brin. thenselves within the exceptions stated
in the case of Young v. Craig, by the oxhibition of ,atisfaitory evidence on those points, this has not been
done.
If the Complainants are entitled to relief the next
enquiry is, how it sh,,uld be granted. The object or
the parties being a sale and purchase of 2000 acres of
l ld, the contract being made for that quantity only,
could Lewis Craig be conp..lled to receive and pay for
more? Let itbe supposed that be had made an improvident
bargain, that the lands were not worth the price he gave
or that since the sale they had greatly depreciated in
value, Mary Frazer or h,- representatives could, on no
principle or equity, take advantage of hier own error to
rcquire payment for a greater quantity of lands than
had c'niie within the contract, and Le%4is Craig might
reliieve minself by a conveyance of the surplus land.
As Lewis Craig was not exposed to the risk of depreciation in value, on principles of reciprocity Mary Frazer and her representatives should be placed in the same
situation. and should be entitled to a spccifc re-conveyance,
so far as it can be had without affecting the right, of
others. It appears from the proceedings that LeN~is
Craig is still in possesion and the owner of a part of
thi i land. and that Jos.ph Craig who was concerned in
the purchase, holds another part ; so far as these extend,
a specific re-conveyance may be decreed. As to the other

Complainants are entitled to their decree in respect to
the surplus laud, but should not consider the principles
before stated correct, as to the manner in which it shoild
be granted, no alt.'rnative seems to remain but that of
adopting the original price (said to have been 95 pr acre,
and from calculation appearing to have been so,) as the
measure of compensation. The purchasers having had
the use and received the rents and profits of the land
should, as an equivalent, be decreed to pay interest, and an
account should be decreed to ascertain the value of the
paper m iney on the 20th December, 1779, and the interest which has accrued.
The length of time which has been suffered to intervene may perhaps he considered as amounting to a waiver of the Complainants equitable right, and be made an
objection to a decree for 'relief in any shape.

In reply to this the following facts, which appear on
the record, are stated.
That the Defendants soon after their pnrchase removed to'Kentlcky, wher they continued to reside, and
that Mary Frazer and her re-,esentatives always resided in, or near Fredericksburgh, in Virginia.
BLDsoM, for the .qppeY._
Craig purchased Mary Frazer's interest, be it muck
ir be it little. Her interest was all lie purchased, and
all he could obtain. And as evidence of it she assigned
the plat and certiflcate of smuvey, that the patent might
issue to Craig for whateverthe survey contained. There
was no mistake here. f Craig has got more land from
the commnonwealth of Vir.ginia than he ought to bave had,
is Mary Frazer or her representatives to step into the

A Complainant in equity must recover on the strength

If the claim of the Complainants to any part of the laln4

arbitrarily designated bN the surveyor whni lie makes

But as it was clearly the intention of the parties that
the whole -lhould be s,,ld, and as the evidence of the

could, inaly

tle testimon' is clear and satiufactury m3 this point;
and, therefore. there is no preteuim for setting nside the

But it is contended that the Complainants re entitled

& OTHERS %Nithinthe swrvey ; either by a decree for the re-conveyv.
altce of the surplus land ; by a pecuniary compensation
CRAIG Ihr it according to its present value; or by a pecuniary
s&o'i ErS. compensation according to the price at w hich the land
was sold, on which interest should be allowsed.
This argument assumes for its basis, that there existed a mistake as to the thing sold. If there was a
mistake, how did it originate, and NIo is injured thereby ? Was there a inistake? It may be enquired to what
quantity of land was Mary Frazer entitled by vii tue of
the governor's warrant issued in pursuance of the royal
proclamation ? To two thousand acres. How much
did site sell and receive pa3 ment for? r1A o thousand
acres. It would appear front this that she had solo and
received payment for as much land as she was entitled
to. How cones it, that this surplus was included in
the survey ? From tlhe fraud, dsign, ignorance or
negligence of the survey'or. W -ho is defraued or inju& d thcrebj ? The commonwealth of Virginia, and
not Mary Frazer. For -%hat is it asked that comapensation shall be made? For land which, by the fraud,
design, ignorance or negligence of the surveyor, Mary
]Frazer might by possibility have been entitled to. Was

the sale of this survey of a speciflc quantity, at a certain
price per acre? or was it a sale of a specific tract?
The bill alleges it was of the first description ; the answers deny it, and say it was of the latter. There is
no pl'oof to support the allegation in the bill, unless
fr) the sur~e3 , a pow.er of attorney, and the receipt
for the purchasq money, it should be infei.'ed, that as
they relate to 2,000 acres of land, only that quantity
was intended to be included in the sale. But this proof
is conceived to furnish a very opposite conclusion, the.
description,and designation.of the tract of land sold, not
as part of a tract, but an entire tract. The answers,
being supported by the assignment, that it was a sale
of the whole survey, and being also responsive to an allegation as well as to an interrogatory in the bill, must
be taken as true and conclusive. When an assignment
is made of a plat and certificate of survey, the purchaser takes it subject to the risk of its containing a
less quantity than is expressed on its face, and should
it contain more he is intitled to it. In the case of "mng

FEBRUARY TERM 18it.
,v. Craig, decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, voWi.ns
(a copy of which'has'been furnished and relied on by & OTUlIS
each party) the Court say, "there was, particularly
v.
6 in thesales made at an early period of this fouzTry, CRAIG
great liberality of admeasurement frequently allowed &OTiERS.
"by the seller and expected by ihe purchaser. Where
"this was the case, to authorize a conclusion, from the
"surplus contained in the boundaries of a tract, that
"there was a mistake of quantity, the surplus ought to
"be greater than was usual in conveyances made about
'6 the same period."
Now it appears from a statement
in the bill, as well as from the general history of the
country, that it was usual and'customary to make considerable allo%iatice in military surveys; and it is not
showc that the surplus in this is greater than in othey
surveys made about the same time. Again, in thesame
case, the Court proceed, "r it would be obviously im"proper and unjust to lay down any general rule as to
",the rate of surplus that would justify an inference of
, mistake which would deserve correction; each case
't must depend upon its own particular circumstances"whether such an inference would be authorized in the
"present case, were the sale in question per acre and
"not in gross, need not be determined since we are of
â€¢ opinion it is of the latter description." If this reasoning be correct as to conveyances, it will apply with
redoubled force to assignments of plats and certificates
of survey, where the purchaser takes it subject to the
risk of its containing less than it specifies.
Mary Frazer or tiz Complainants can be considere4
in no other view, than mere volunteers mnalafide, and of
course not entitled to the aid of a Court of Equity,
It seems, as a necessary consequence, if the Complainants are not entitled to the sirrplus land, they are not
to compensation in either of the other modes contended
for. Where there is noiight there can be no claim to
compensation sustained.
Decree affirmed with costs.
