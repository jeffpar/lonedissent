Statement of the case.

ties, in cases-like this, is in the nature of a trust.* The jurisdiction of a court of equity to interfeie in all cases involving such an ingredient, is too clear to require any citation of
authorities. It rests upon an elementary principle of equity
jurisprudence.
"The power is reserved to a court of equity to act upon
*a principle often above-mentioned, namely, that whenever
there is a right it ought to be madeefectual."t Where there
is a right which the common law, from any imperfection,
cannot enforce, it is the province and duty of a court of
equity to supply the defectand furnish the remedy.1
The decree is REVERSED. A mandate will.be sent to the
Circuit Court directing that the demurrer be overruled, and
the cause proceeded in according to the principles of equity
and the ru] a of equity practice.

BELOIT V. MORGAN.

1. A judgment in favor of a bondholder upon certain municipal bonds, part
of a larger issue, against the town issuing them, is conclusive on a question of the validity of the issue on a-suit brought by the same creditor
against the same town, on other bonds, another part of the same issue;
the parties being identical, and all objections taken by the town in the
second suit having been open to be taken by it in the former one.
2. A legislative enactment created the city of Beloit, carving it out of territory previously covered by the town of Beloit only. The statute enacted thus:
"All principal and interest upon all bonds which have heretofore been issued by the town of'Beloit, for railroad stock or other purposes, shall be paid
when the same, or any portion of, the same, shall fall due, by the city and
town of Beloit, in the same proportions as if said town ande
city were not dissolved, such proportions to be apportioned," &o.

Held, that this made bonds issued by the town valid, assuming that previously to the act they were not so.

the supervisors of the town of Beloit to subscribe to the cap.
ital stock of a certain railroad company, and to pay for the
same in the bonds of the town, payable at the expiration of
a term named, and with a rate of interest specified.
The supervisors, professing to execute the authority so
conferred) did subscribe to the stock of a certain railroad
company and ipsued bonds; of many of which one Morgan
became the holder, bondfide.
Whether the bonds were issued pursuant to the authority
which the statute gave to the supervisors, soon became a
matter of controversy between the holders of them and the
authorities of Beloit. These last asserted that they were
not so issued, but were made without any legal authority;
were in violation of the act of the legislature, and constituted
a corrupt and usurious contract. They would accordingly
pay nothing on the bonds.
In this state of things the legislature of Wisconsin, in
1856, created the city of Beloit; carving it out of territory
which constituted the former town of Beloit. The charter of
the new city provided thus:
"All principal and interest upon all bonds which have heretofore been issued by the town of Beloit for railroad stock or
other purposes, when the same or any portion thereof shall fall
due, SHALL be paid by the city and town of Beloit in the same
iroportions as if said town and city were not dissolved."
This provision was re-enacted in 1857, in an act amending the charter of the city.
With this act in force, Morgan brought suit at law for the
interest of some of his bonds, against the town of Beloit, and
on the 9th of January, 1861, obtained judgment against it.
He now also brought other suits against the town, on
other of the bonds, not the same specific instruments, of
course, as those on which be had obtained judgment, but
part of the same issue, and a suit on which involved the same
questions as did the suit on those on which he had already
recovered.

eBELOIT v. MOR&Ax.
Opinion of the court.

Thereupon. the town of Beloit filed a bill, the bill below,
in. the Circuit Court for Wisconsin, to enjoin the proceedings
at law, and to compel a surrender of the bond . The'answer'
set up,
1. By way of estoppel, the judgment of 9th January, 1861,
on certain of the bonds, as conclusive of the validity of the
whole issue, and'
2. The act of 1856 and its re-enactment of 1857, and alleged that it was the intention of the legislature to provide
by those acts that the bonds in question should be pAid and
that they were a legislative ratification of the bonds, with
effebt to cure any irregularity or want of authotity.
The court below dismissed the bill. Appeal accordingly.
.Messrs. -Palmerand Ryan, for the appellant;Mr. Carpenter,
contra.
Mr. Justice SWAYINE delivered the opinion-of the court.
The bonds and coupons to which this litigation relates
vere issued under the same statute of Wisconsin, and for
the same purpose, as those involved in the preceding case,
just decided. The object of the bill is to enjoin the appellee
from proceeding in the suits at law which he has instituted
upon a part of thesecurities in his hands; and to have those
and all others belonging to him, delivered up and cancelled.
The court below heard and dismissed the case. It is brought
, here by this appeal for re-examination.
Numerous' objections have been made to the validity of
the bonds.
The argument on both sides has been learned and elaborate. The view which we have taken of the case will render it necessary to consider but two of-the points to which
our attention has been called.
I. On the 9th of January, 1861, the appellee recovered a
judgment at law against the appellant upon another portion
of these securities-though not the same with those in question in this case. The parties were identical, and the title
involved was the same.' All the objections taken in this

case might have been taken in that. The judgment of the
court could have been invoked upon each of them, and if it
were adverse to th6 appellant, he might have brought the
decision here by a writ of error for review. The court had
fall jurisdiction over the parties and the subject. Under
such circumstances, a-judgment is conclusive, not only as to
the res of that case, but as to all further litigation between
same parties touching the same subject-matter, though the
res itself may be different.
An apt illustration of this principle is found in Gardner v.
Buckbee.* Gardner bought a vessel from Buckbee, and
gave two notes for the purchase-money. Buckbee sued him
upon one of the notes in the Marine Court. Gardner set up
as a defence, fraud in the sale and a want of consideration.
A verdict and judgment were rendlered in his favor. In a
suit upon the other note, in the Common Pleas of the City
of New York, the judgment in the Marine Court was held
to be an estoppel upon the subject of fraud iii the sale.
Bouchaud v. Dias,t -Doty v. Brownv?,l and Babcock v. Camp,ยง
are to the same effect and equally cogent. Such has been
the rule of the common law from an early period of its history down to the present time.j But the principle reaches
further. It extends not only to the questions of fact and of
law, which were decided in the former suit, but also to the
grounds of recovery or defence which might have been, but
were not, presented.
In Hewderson v. Henderson,1 the Vice-Chancellor said:
"In trying this question, I believe I state the rule of the
court correctly, that whe'e a given matter becomes the subject of litigation in, and of adjudication by, a court of comtfetent jurisdicticn, the court requires the parties to bring
forward their whole case, and will not, except under special

.BFLOIT V. M6ORGA.

623

Opinion of Phe court:

cifeumstances, permit the same parties to 6pen the same
subject of litigation in respect of a matter which might have
been brought forward as a part of the subject iii contest, but
which was not brought forward, only because they have,
from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted a
part of" their case. The plea of res judicata applies, except
in special cases, not only to the points upon which the court
was required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce
a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to
the subject of liaigation,,and .which the .parties, exercising
reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at ihe
time."
A. pgrty can no more split up defences than indivisible demands, and present them by piecemeal in su6cessive suits
growing out of the same trausaction.* The judgment at
Jaw established conclusively the original validity of the securities described in the bill, and the liability of the town 'to
pay them. Nothing is disclosed in the case which affects
this condition of things.
M. The city of Beloit was chartered by the legislature of
Wisconsin in 1856. It embraces i. part of the territory which
previously belonged to the town of Beloit. In the seventeenth
section of the charter it is enacted that "all principal and
interest upon all bonds which have heretofore been issiued
by the town of Deoit for railroadstock or other purposes, when
the same or any portion thereof shall fall due, shall be paid
by the city and town of Beloit in the same proportions as if
said town and city were not dissolved," &c.
This provision was re-enacted in 1857 in an act amending
the charter of the city. .'o bonds were issued in payment
for railroad stock but those to a part of which this controversy
relates. The language used by the'legislature is clear and
explicit. No gloss can raisea doubt as to its moaning. It
distihictly affirms, and the affirmation is repeated, that the
bonds, shall be paid.
The only point to be considered is the effect of this proSBendernagle

[Sup. CL

Syllabus:

vision. That is not an open question in this court. 'Whenever it has been presented, the ruling has been that, in cases
of bonds issued by municipal corporations, under a statute
upon the subject, ratification by the legislature is in all respects equivalent to original authority, and cures all defects
of power, if such defects existed, and all irregularities in its
execution.* The same principle has been applied in the
courts of the States.t This court has repeatedly recognized
the validity of private and curative statutes, and given them
full effect, where the interests of private individuals were
alone concerned, and were largely involved and affected.1
The earlier and more important of these authorities are so
well known to the profession and are so often referred to,
that it would be waste of time to comment upon them. We
hold this objection also fatal to the appellant's case.
Several other important propositions have been discussed
by the learned counsel for the appellee. They have not been
congidered, and-we express no opinion in regard to them.
DECREE AFFIRMED.

THE BtLFAST.
1. In all cases where a maritime lien arises, the original jurisdiction to en-

force it by a proceeding in rem, is exclusive in the District Courts of
the United States, as provided by the ninth section of the Judiciary
Act of 1789.

2., State legislatures have no authority to create maritime liens; nor can
they confer jurisdiction upon a State court, to enforce such a lien by a
suit or proceeding in rem, as practised in admiralty courts.
3. Upon an ordinary contract of affreightment, th6 lien of the shipper is a
maritime lien; and a proceeding in rem, to enforce it, is within the exGelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wallace, 220; Thomson v. Lee County, 3 Id. 327.
