Syllabus.

The bill claims reductions of the rents for failure of water
from the second of Oetober, 1857, when the title of the de-feudants accrued, down to*the first of May, 1865, when the
last instalments, before the filing of the bill, became due,
amounting in the aggregate to $2649. The rents, during.
the same, period, amounted to a much larger sum. Uonceding the appellant's demand to be correct, he should at
least have tendered payment of the difference between these'
two amounts, and interest, before bringing his bill. In not
alleging that he had done so the bill is fatally defective.
A case is not presented upon which a court of equity,
according to the settled principles of its jurisprudence, is
authorized to interpose. The spirit manifested by the appellant throughout the litigation between the parties, as disclosed by the bill, is not persuasive to such a tribunal to lend
him its aid. ' We think the demurrer was well taken. The
decree of the Circuit Court is
AkFFIRMED

PAYNE V. HOOK.
1. The equity jurisdiction and remedies conferred by the Constitution and
statutes of the United States cannot be limited or restrained by State
legislation, and are uniform throughout the different States of the Union.
Hence the Circuit Court for any district embracing a particular State,will have jurisdiction of an equity proceeding against an administrator
(if according to the received principles of equity a case for eqqitable
relief is stated), notwithstanding that by a ieculiar structure of the
State probate system such a proceeding could not be maintained in any
court of the State.
2. In a bill in equity in the Circuit Court, by one distributee of an intestate's
estate against-an administrator, it is not indispensable that such distributee make the other distributees parties, if the court is able to proceed to a decree, either through a reference to a master or some other
proper way, to do justice to the parties-before it without injury.to absent
parties equally interested.
8. The sureties of an administrator oh his official 'bond may properly be
joined with.him in an equity proceeding for an erroneous and fraudulent administration of the estate byhim,.and where, if a balance should,
be found against the administrator, those sureties would be liable.

Statement of the case.
4. A bill involving but a single matter and affecting all defendants alike is
not multifarious, although it may seek both to open settlements and to
cancel receipts as fraudulent
ANN PAYNE, a citizen of Virginia, exhibited her bill in
the Circuit Court of the United States for Missouri, against
Zadoc Hook, public administrator of Calloway County, in
that State, and his sureties on his official bond, all citizens of
Missouri, to obtain her distributive share in the estate of her
brother, Fielding Curtis, who died intestate, in 1861, and
whose estate was committed to the charge of the public
administrator, by order of the County Court of Calloway
County. It appeared that Curtis never married, and that
his nearest of kin were entitled to distribution of his estate.
The bill, without mentioning of what State they were citizens,
and without making them complainants, set forth the names
of the distributees, brothers or sisters, like the complainant,
of the intestate, or their children. The bill charged gross
misconduct on the part of the administrator; that he had
made false settlements with the Court of Probate; withheld
a true inventory of the property in his hands; used the
money of the estate for his private gain; and obtained from
the claimant, by fraudulent representations, a receipt in full
for her share of the estate, on the payment of a less sum than
she was entitled to receive. The object of the bill was to
obtain relief against these fraudulent proceedings, and to
compel a true account of administration, in order that the
real condition of the estate can be ascertained,'and the 'complainant paid what justly belongs to her. It appeared from
the bill that Hook had not yet made his final settlement.
The defendant demurred generally, and without assigning
any specific grounds for the demurrer. On the argument
of the demurrer below, the demurrer was endeavored to be
supported,
1. Because, in Missouri, exclusive jurisdiction over all
disputes concerning the duties or accounts of administrators,
until final settlement, is given to the local county court,
which is the Court of Probate; and because, as the administration complained of was still in progress in the County

Argument- for the administrator.

'Court of Galloway Cofinty, resort was to be had to that
court to correct the accounts of the administrator, if fraudulent or erroneous.
2. Because the other distributees were not made parties;
an'd so that the case was without proper parties.
3. Because the sureties of the administrator were joined
in tbe proceeding.
4. Because the bill was multifarious.
The court below sustained the demurrer, and the complainant electing to abide by her pleading, the bill was dismissed, and the case brought here by appeal.
"Mr. _Napton; in support of the decree below:
1, It is perfectly settled, in Missouri, .that a court of cbaupery, under its laws, cannot grant the relief asked in this
lcase until the jurisdiction of the Probate Court is exhausted,
or the final settlement of accounts made.* No such settlement was here made'
• The question then is, will the Federal court,, sitting in
Missouri, when called upon to interpret State laws in A case
where the jurisdiction is given solely because of the noncitizenship of one of the parties, give a relief which the
State courts could not?
The chancery jurisdiction of the Federal courts is, wa
concede, the same throughout the Union; and conferred-by
the Judiciary Act and the Constitution.. What is equity
and what is law does not either, with these courts, depend
on the State laws or codes of practice.
But the point is, that upon the very principles of equity
law, borrowed from England and adopted here, this case
ceases to be one of equitable cognizance (or legal-cognizance
either), just as well in the Federal courts as in the State
courts, because of the peculiar structure of the probate sys-.
tern in Missouri, and because the State laws creating that
system, and the adjudged construction of those laws, will
be enforced in this trIbunal just as they would be in a State
tribunal, and not 9verturned or disregarded.

[Sup. Ct

Argument forthe administrator.

If this is not so, we have the anomaly of citizens not of
Missouri, having rights in Missouri and under Missouri laws,
which the citizens of Missouri have not; and we put the
former not only on an equality with the latter, but actually
on a superiority to them. Such a system would be anything else than harmonious. Moreover, it would overturn
the whole system of probate jurisdiction in Missouri, so far
as persons outside of that State are concerned;' for if the
United States courts, when called on to construe the Missouri laws concerning administration, &c., can entertain such
a bill 'as the present, contrary to the received practice in
this State, then creditors' bills, legatees' bills, bills for marslialling assets, &c., which are common in other States and in
England, although unknown in Missouri, would be equally
admissible, and thus our system would be completely overturned.
In Ewing v. City of St. Louis,* the point seems adjudicated :
"1Anon-resident complainant can ask no greater relief in the
courts of the United States than he could obtain were he to
resort to the State courts. If in the latter courts equity would
afford no relief, neither will it in the former."
The exclusive jurisdiction of the Probate Court of Missouri. until a final settlement, is a matter not affecting the
chancery jurisdiction as a mere remedy, but in the nature
of a right. It is, in effect, a species of limitation law, and
so the State tribunals regard it, for there is uothing in the
equity law of Missouri different from the equity law of this
court.
The point thus made is the principal ground of the demurrer. But,
2. The other distributees having been as much interested
as the complainant, would properly have been parties. As
matters now stand, the public administrator is liable to be
harassed by as many suits as there are distributees.

Opinion of the court.

8. The sureties are not liable until their principal fails
to pay. There is then a complete and adequate remedy
against them at law, and on their bond. There is no reason
to make them parties in a proceeding like this, even supposing the claim against the principal well founded,-a matter
denied.
4. The bill is multifarious. It seeks a rescission of a contract, the overhauling of inventories, accounts, &c., correcting of settlements, and for general relief.
Mr. Glover, contr.
Mr. Justice DAVIS delivered the opinion of the court.
Thejurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Missouri to hear
this cause is deiiied, because,.in that State, exclusive jurisdicti6n over all disputes concerning the duties or accounts
of administrators, until final settlement, is givei to the local
county court, which is the Court of Probate; and as the
administration complained of is still in progress in the
County Court of Calloway County, resort must be had to'
that court to correct the errors and frauds in the accounts
of the administrator.
The theory of the position is this: that a Federal court
of chancery, sitting in Missouri, will not enforce demands
against an administrator or executor, if the court of the
State, having general chancery powers, could not enforce
similar demands. In other words, as the complainant, were
she a citizen of Missouri, could obtain a redress of her
grievances only through the local Court of Probate, she has
no better or different rights, because she happens to be a
citizen of Virginia.
If this position could be maintained, an important part of
the jurisdiction conferred on the Federal courts by the Constitution and laws of Congress, would be abrogated. As
the citizen of one State has the constitutional right to sue a
citizen of anothell State in the courts of the United States,
instead of resorting to a State tribunal, of what value would
that right be, if the court in which the suit is instituted

PAYNE V. HOOK.

[Sup. Ck.

Opinion of the court.

could not proceed to judgment, and afford a suitable measure
of redress? The right would be worth nothing to tfe party
entitled to its enjoyment, as it could not produce any beneficial results. But this objection to the jurisdiction of the
Federal tribunals has been heretofore presented to this court,
and overi'uled.
We have repeatedly held "that the jurisdiction of the
courts of the United States over controversies between citizens of different States, cannot be impaired by the laws of
the States, which prescribe the modes of redress in their
courts, or which regulate the distribution of their judicial
power."* If legal remedies are sometimes modified to suit
the changes in the laws of the 'States, and the practice of
their courts, it is not so with equitable. The equity jurisdiction conferred on the Federal courts is the same that the
High Court of Chancery in England possesses; is subject to
neither limitation or restraint by State legislation, and is
unifbrm throughout the different States of the Union.t'
The Circuit Court of the United States for the District
of Missouri, therefore, had jurisdiction to hear and determine this controversy, notwithstanding the peculiar structure of the Missouri probate system, and was bound to
exercise it, if the bill, according to the received principles
of equity, states a case for equitable relief. The absence of
a complete and adequate remedy at law, is the only test of
equity jurisdiction, and the application of this pfinciple to
a particular case must depend on the character of the case,
as disclosed in the pleadings.1
"It is not enough that there is a remedy at law. It must
be plain and adequate, or, in other words, as practical and
efficient to the ends of justice, and its prompt administration,
as the remedy in equity."§

Opinion of the court.

It is very evident that an action at common law, on the
bond of the admin-istrator, would not give to the ormplainant
a practical and efficient remedy for the wrongs which, she
says, she has suffered. A proceeding at law is not flexible
enough to reach the fraudulent conduct of the administrator,
which is the groundwvork of this bill, nor to furnish proper
relief against it. It is, however, well settled that a court of
chancery, as anincident to its power to ,enforce trusts, and
make those holding a fiduciary relation account, has jurisdiction to compel executors and administrators to account
and distribute the assets in their hands. The bill under
review has this, object, and nothing more. It seeks to compel the defendant, Hook, to account and piy over to Mrs.
PNyne her rightful share in the estate of her brother; and
in case he should not do it, to fix the liability of the sureties
on his bond.
But it is said the proper parties for a decree are not before'
the court, as. the bill shows there are other 'distributees besides the complainant. It is undoubtedly true that all.persons
materially interested in the subject-matter of the suit should
be made parties to it; but this rule, like all general rules,
being founded in convenience, will yield, whenever it is
necessary that it should yield, in order to accomplish the
ends of justice. It will yield, if the court is able to proceed
to a decree, and do justice to the parties before it, without
injury to absen persons, equally interested in the litigation,
but who cannot conveniently be xhade parties to the suit.*
The necessity for the relaxation Qf the rule is more especially apparent in the courts of the United States, where,
oftentimes, the enforcement of the rule would oust them of
their jurisdiction, and deprive parties entitled to the interposition of a court of equity of any remedy whatever.t
The priesent case affords an ample illustration -of this
necessity. The complainant sues as one of the next of kin,

and names the other distributees, who have the same common interest, without stating of what particular State they
are citizens. It is fair to presume, in the absence of any
averments to. the contrary, that they are citizens of Missouri. If so, they could not be joined as plaintiffs, for that
would take away the jurisdiction of the court; and why
make them defendants, when the controversy is not with
them, but the administrator and his sureties? It can never
be indispensable to make defendants of those against whom
nothing is alleged and from whoin no relief is asked. A
court of equity adapts its decrees to the necessities of each
case, and should the present suit terminate in a deiree
against the defendants, it is easy to do substantial justice to
all the parties in interest, and prevent a multiplicity of suits,
by allowing the other distributees, either through a refernce. to a master, or by some other proper proceeding, to
come in and share in the benefit of the litigation.*
The next objection which we have to consider is, that the
sureties of the administrator are not proper parties to this
suit. Their liability on the bond in an action at law is not
denied, but it is insisted they cannot be suqd in equity. If
this doctrine were to prevail, a court of chancery, in the
exercise of its power to compel an administrator to account
for the property of his intestate, would be unable to do
complete justice, for if, on settlement of the accounts, a
balance should be found due the estate, the parties in interest, in case the administrator should fail to pay, would
be turned over to a court of law, to renew the litigation with
his sureties. A court of equity does not act in this way. It
disposes ofa case so as to end litigation, not to foster it; to.
diminish suits, not to multiply them. Having power to
determine the liability of the administrator for his misconduct, it necessarily has an equal power, in order to meet the
possible exigency of the administrator's inability to satisfy
the decree, to settle the amount which the sureties on the
bond, in that event, would have to pay.

Besides, it is for the interest of the sureties that they
should be joined in the suit with their principal, as it' enables them to see that the accounts are correctly settled, and
the administrator's liability ixed on a proper basis. If they
were not made parties, considering the nature and extent
of their obligation, they would have just cause of complaint.
It is said the bill is multifarious, but we cannot see any
ground for such an objection.. A bill cannot be said to be
multifarious unless it embraces distinct matters, which do
not affect all the defendants alike. This case involves but
a single matter, and that is the true condition of the estate
of Fielding Curtis, which, when asceftained, wilf determine
the rights of the nextiof kin. In this -investigation all the
defendants are jointly interested. It is true the bill seeks
to open the settlements With the Probate Court as fraudulent, and to cancel the receipt and transfer from the complainant to the administrator, because obtained by false
representations; but the determination of these questions is
necessary to arrive at the proper value of the estate, and in
their determination the sureties are concerned, for 'the very
object of the bond which they gave was to protect the estate
against frauds, which the administrator might commit to its
prejudice.
