erly brought into market.

UNITED STATES V. GAUSSEN.
1. Under the act of March 3d, 1797, enacting that in suits against delinquent
revenue officers, "a transcript from the books and proceedings of the
treasury shall be evidence," it is not necessary that every account with
any individual and all of every account, should be transcribed. An
extract may be given in evidence if not garbled or mutilated-that is to
say, an extract wherein credits are not suppressed, and which does not
confine itself to results, or balances without details, but which is complete in itself-perfect for what it purports to represent-and which gives
both sides of the account as it stands upon the books of the treasury.
2. The court, however, states that "it is not authorized to regulate the manner in which the departments shall keep their books, or to prescribe the
minuteness of detail," and that the statements and details of daily business made by a collector are necessarily condensed when carried to a
ledger account, and the results of many items stated in a briefer form than
that in which they stood on the original entries. And it confines itself
to saying that certain particular transcripts, all much alike, offered in
the ease, and one of which is given by the Reporter at large as an illustration of the whole, were sufficiently minute.
3. The said act of March 3d, 1797, proceeds upon the theory that the officers
of the Government shall make up the account of every revenue officer,
that it shall adjust the same on its books, and that the account thus
stated and adjusted shall stand as and for the sum for which such officer
shall be liable to it. The statement is prima facie evidence only.
A transcript of the accounts rendered by a collector himself (when not
partial or fragmentary), is evidence against the surety on his official
bond.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana:
the case being thus:
.Anact of March 3d, 1797,* enacts:
"SECTIoN 1. That when any revenue officer . ..shall neglect
or refuse to pay into the treasury the sum or balance reported
to be due to the United States upon the adjustment of his ac.

counts, it shall be the duty of the comptroller to institute suit
for the recovery of the same, adding to the sum stated to be
due, on such account, the commissions of the delinquent, which
shall be forfeited in every instance where suit is commenced and
judgment obtained.
"SECTION 2. That in every case of delinquency, where a suit
has been or shall be instituted, a transcript from the books and
proceedings of the treasury, certified by the register and authenticated under the seal of the department, shall be admitted as
evidence, and the court trying the cause shall be thereupon authorized to grant judgment and award execution accordingly.
"SEcTION 4. That in suits between the United States and individuals, no claim for a credit shall be admitted upon trial but
such as shall appear to have been presented to the accounting
officers of the treasury for their examination, and by them disallowed."
This act being in force, the United States sued Gaussen,
executor of Elgee, in the court below, on a bond given in
1845, by Thomas Barrett, as collector of the customs at the
port of New Orleans, in which bond Elgee was a surety.
The declaration filed by the goverunlent referred to a transcript, which was annexed to and made part of it, from the
books of the treasury, containing eight certain quarterly
reports, numbered 5688, &c., of the first auditor, upon the
quarterly accounts of Barrett, as admitted and certified by
the comptroller and commissioner of customs, and "statements of differences" thereon; and also copies of quarterly
accounts current rendered by Barrett, the collector, himself.
Each class of things covered the whole term that Barrett
was in office.
The report of the first auditor and the statement of differences thereon were, as respected the report numbered 5688,
in this form; the reports bearing the other numbers being
in form very similar:

THOMAS BARRETT,
Collector.

Indorsed: "The United States in account current with Thomas

Barrett, from 25th July to 30th September, 1844.

thus:
"I also find that he is entitled

as follows, by

Balance of his account of official emoluments from 1st July, 1844, to 12th October,
$16,529 75"
...........
1815, as per report No. 6771 ......

There was no report No. 6771 in evidence.
The whole of these records (that is to say, reports of the
first auditor, the statement or differences, and the quarterly accounts current of Barrett hilself), were attached
together and certified by one certificate of the. register and

UNITED STATES

v.

GAUSSEN.

[Sup. Ot.

Statement of the case.

by one impression of the seal of the treasury, to be true
copies of the said reports of the first auditor, of the said
statement of differences, and of the said quarterly accounts
current of Barrett.
On the trial the government offered as evidence the copies
of the reports of the First Auditor, numbered respectively
5688, &c., and also of the statements of differences thereon,
"all of said papers," said the bill of exceptions, "being fastened together as a whole and embraced in one certificate;
till of which more fully and at large appears by the said
transcript of said report and adjustment of account filed in
this cause with the plaintiff's petition therein."
The defendant, "while making no objection to the form
or substance of the certificate by which the authenticity of
such transcript was attested," objected to the same on the
grounds"That the act of the 3d of March, 1797, which makes tran.
scripts from the books and proceedings of the treasury evidence,
only applies to public defaulters in terms, and, being in derogation of common right and penal in its character, cannot be extended by construction so as to make such transcripts evidence
against the sureties of such defaulters or the legal representatives of deceased sureties.
"That the said reports, which, together with the quarterly

The court held the objections good, and rejected the evidence.
The government afterwards offered in evidence certified
copies of the several quarterly statements of accounts rendered by Barrett himself to the United States, " w hich said
certified copies aforesaid were and are on file in the suit,
having been filed with the petition and contained in the
said document, marked and already made part of this bill
of exceptions."
This evidence was objected to on the ground that the said
statement was not legal proof of the existence of a debt by
Barrett, did not tend to prove the same, and was not competent evidence thereof, and that the same were fragmentary
and incomplete. This evidence was excluded, and the plaintiff excepted to the ruling.
Verdict and judgment having gone for the defendant, the
government brought the case here.

differences were not admissible in evitlence separately from the
quarterly returns.
Not everything which a treasury officer chooses to write
upon the books of the treasury thereby becomes evidence
under the act of March 3d, 1797. Those matters of which
the treasury officers have official knowledge, and which
upon such knowledge they have recorded in the books of
the treasury, thereby become evidence. But when those
officers ascertain facts by evidence, that evidence becomes
part of their proceedings, and their conclusions, apart from
the evidence upon which they are founded, are not evidence.*
In the present case the auditor's reports contained debits
of large sums received as duties upon imports by the collector at New Orleans-a matter of which the auditor had
no official knowledge-and although annexed to the transcript containing those reports there were copies of the re-

turns containing the evidence on which those debits were
entered against the collector, the attorney for the plaintiff
sought to introduce the auditor's reports without the said
returns. When, for instance, the auditor, in settlement
No. 5688, certified that he had examined the accounts of
Thomas Barrett, collector, &c., and found he was chargeable
with $168,645.76 duties on merchandise to September 30,
and with $2502.24 "duties on railroad iron imported in
1836, but such duties not credited by the collector at that
time," the accounts so examined, as well as the result of
the examination, were part of the proceedings. The report
of the auditor purports to find its facts in the accounts rendered by Barrett, and had it been admitted in evidence the
defendant would have been put to proof that the duties accrued in 1836 had not been received by him within the
period covered by the bond. Whereas, had the accounts
themselves been put in evidence as part of the proceedings,
it would have been found that no such amount was acknowl-

edged therein, and that the " finding" of the first auditor
was without any evidence to support it.

UNITED STATES V.

Argument against the admission.

With each report of the auditor is a "statement of differences," purporting to show in what particulars the amount
stated by the auditor differs from that rendered by the collector. It begins by setting down "the balance due the
United States per his account ending" at such date, and this
balance is increased by the addition of such sums as the
collector has taken credit for, but which the auditor has refused to allow. It is only by comparing this statement with
the original account rendered that the matters of difference
between the parties can be understood. And any paper
which was passed upon by the auditor and is necessary to a
correct understanding of the action of the auditor, is a part
of the proceedings.
For example: In the report already cited, Io. 5688, the
collector is credited with contingent expenses $783.46,* and
in the statement of diflbrences it is stated that $3239.13t have
been disallowed, thus accounting for $4022.59 as if it were
the whole amount charged by the collector; but on looking
at his account (on page 204), it is seen that he has charged
for contingent expenses $4394.65, and the auditor has thus
failed to consider and pass upon ($4394.65 less $4122.69)
$372.06, either by allowance or disallowance.
This example, taken from the bill of exceptions, was
brought to the notice of the court when the transcript was
excluded.
2. The quarterly returns were not admissible in evidence without the auditor's reports.
The defendant is entitled to the benefit of all credits allowed by the accounting officers. But as credits claimed,
if not admitted by the accounting officers, must be proven,
then it follows that to admit the quarterly returns without
the auditor's reports would be to deny the defendant the
benefit of all credits given him at the treasury, and put
him to proof of all the credits anew. This would have been

a great hardship and one which no court would impose, especially if, as stated in the bill of exceptions, the reports
thus omitted contained credits which do not appear in the
quarterly returns, but do appear first in the settlements
made after the collector's death, and which with other settlements the United States declined to offer with the quarterly returns.

3. But if the plaintff had offered in evidence the complete transcript of which they offered parts, it would not have been admissible.
It is on its face fragmentary and imperfect, and it moreover contains items not within the scope of the liability of
surety on whose bond the suit was brought. We assume
that under the act of 1797, which alone makes such a transcript evidence, the transcript must contain, 1st, all the proceedings; 2d, a decision either of allowance or disallowance
of all claims to credit, which have been submitted to the
accounting officers; 3d, debits manifestly and clearly not
within the scope of the account settled and adjusted.
Now in this case,

1. The transcriptwas incomplete.
In one of the settlements isa gross amount brought into
the account as
"Balance of his account of official emoluments from 1st July,
1844, to 12th October, 1845, as per report No. 6771, $16,529.73."*
Such a transcript was rejected in United States v. Paterson.t
A "balance" implies debits and credits, but the report No.
6771, in which they are contained, is not produced; and the
transcript thus on its face is fragientary and imperfect, and
shows that there has been a settlement with the collector
which is not contained in the transcript. It is unimportant
that the unproduced settlement resulted in a credit. There
are debits in it, as appears by the result being a "balance,"
and the mischief is the same whether debits be unjustly
charged, or credits be unjustly withheld.

Opinion of the court.

2. In the instance cited on p. 209, from report No. 5688,
the collector had claimed credit fir largre disbursements on
account of contingent expenses. Portions of these were
allowed in gross, and other portions rejected, and still other
portions are not specially either allowed or rejected.
The act of 1797 declares that no credit, not allowed by
the accounting officer, shall be allowed on the trial, unless
it has been presented to the accounting officer, " and disallowed," or has not been presented by reason of accident or
absence from the United States. It results from this provision that the officer is entitled to the decision or the accounting officers on every item, and this court so ruled in
United Slates v. Jones.*
In these cases where the accounting officers have failed
to account for more than a small part of the difference between the amount charged by the collector and that admitted by the auditor, it is manifest that, in order to obtain
credit for the part rejected, the defendant must prove the
whole, for as he cannot identify the part admitted, if he
prove any amount less than the whole, the part already admitted will be deducted from it, and he will lose the balance.
8. There are debits in the transcript not within the scope
of the liability sought to be enforced. One is seen in the
report No. 5688, where there is a charge of duties on railroad iron imported in 1836, and as we understand the entry,
paid in 1836, but "not credited by the collector at that
time."
A transcript containing such an item is not admissible
in evidence against a surety on a bond dated in 1844.
Xr. C. H. Rill, Assistant Attorney-General, contra.
Mr. Justice HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
The act of March 3d, 1797, proceeds upon the theory that
the officers of the United States shall make up the account
* 8 Peters, 375, 382.

UNITED STATES

v.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

of every revenue officer, that it shall adjust the same on ita
books, and that the account thus stated and adjusted shall
stand as and for the sum for which such officer shall be
liable to the government. This no doubt is subject to co'rection by such competent evidence as may be produced.
In other words, the statement is prime facie evidence only,
not'absolute and conclusive.
In furtherance of this idea it is the duty of the comptroller at once to institute suit for the recovery of the balance
thus found and stated. A second result, and one indispensable to the existence of the theory, is, that the books shall
be evidence of the truth of the amounts thus stated and declared to be due to the United States. The act, therefore,
provides that a transcript from these books and proceedings
szhall be admitted in evidence, and that, thereupon, the court
is authorized to proceed to judgment and execution.
Ini the present case "copies of the report of the first auditor," numbered respectively 5688, &c., and eight in number,
were offered in evidence. The bill of exceptions states that
no objection was made to the manner in which they were
certified.
The suggestion that the act is applicable to a defaulting
principal, and not a surety, is not pressed and need not be
considered.
The objection that the reports were fragmentary and incomplete is not sustained by the fitets. As presented in the
record each report is complete and perfect in itself. Each
report contains all upon the subject during the time that it
purports to represent. In the aggregate they cover the
whole period of Barrett's service. The statute says that a
transcriptfrom the books shall be admitted as evidence. A
transcript or a transcribing is substantially a copy. A copy
from the books, and not of the books, shall be admissible
in evidence. Au extract from the books, a portion of the
books, when authenticated to be a copy, may be given in
evidence. While a garbled statement is not evidence, or a
mutilated statement, wherein the debits shall be presented
and the ci edits suppressed, or perhaps a statement of results

Opinion of the court.

only, it still seems to be clear that it is not necessary that
every account with an individual, and all of every account,
shall be transcribed as a condition of the admissibility of
any one account. The statement presented should be complete in itself, perfect for what it purports to represent, and
give both sides of the account as the same stands upon the
books.*
Nor is the objection that the reports charge Barrett with
gross sums and with balances without giving details, sustained by the facts.
The reports are made up with much particularity, and
give the items on each side of the account. It is not a case
of a certificate of balances merely. We are not authorized,
however, to regulate the manner in which the departments
shall keep their books, or to prescribe the minuteness of the
detail. The items in these reports are manifestly made up
from statements and details of the daily business furnished
by the collector. They are necessarily condensed when carried to a ledger account, and the results of many items or
of some considerable period of time, may be stated in a
briefer form than they stood upon the original entries. The
means of particular information are open to either party.
We see no objection on this ground to the evidence now
presented, and are of the opinion that there was error in its
exclusion.
There was error also in excluding the evidence of the accounts rendered by Barrett, the principal. They seem to
be complete, not partial or fragmentary as alleged, and being
statements made by him to the government in the performance of his official duty, they are evidence against the party
making them not only, but his sureties as well, and against
third persons in privity with him. The authorities place
the rule upon the ground-Ist, that the entries made are
against the interest of the party making them; and 2dy,
that a surety is bound by the acts and declarations of his

JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND A NEW TRIAL ORDERED.

v.

DUNN.

1. Where, after a suit has been properly removed from a State court into
the Circuit Court of the United States, under the act of March 2d, 1867,
which allows such removal, in certain cases specified by it, "at any
time before the final hearing or trial of the suit," the State court still
goes on to adjudicate the case, against the resistance of the party who
got the removal, such action on its part is a usurpation, and the fact
that such a party has contested the suit in such State court, does not,
after a judgment against him, on his bringing the proceedings here for
reversal and direction to proceed no further, constitute a waiver on
his part, of the question of the jurisdiction of the State court to have
tried the case.
2. The language above quoted-" at any time before the final hearing or
trial of the suit"-of the act of Mlarch 2d, 1867, is not of the same import as the language of the act of July 27th, 1866, on the same general
subject-" at any time before the trial or final hearing." On the contrary, the word "final " in the first-mentioned act, must be taken to
Accordapply to the word " trial" as well as to the word "hearing."
ingly, although a removal was made after a trial on merits, a verdict,
a motion for a new trial mado and refused, and a judgment on the verdict, yet it having been so made in a State where by statute the party
could still demand, as of right, a second trial, held, that such first trial
was not a "1final trial" within the meaning of the act of Congress; the
party seeking to remove the case having demanded and having got leave
to have a second trial under the said statute of the State.
