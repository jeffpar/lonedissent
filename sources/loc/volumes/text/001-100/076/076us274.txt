gage, built and completed the saw-mill in the full belief,
induced by the conduct and declarations of the appellant,
that it would be accepted as a compliance with the stipulation indorsed on the second mortgage. Taken as a whole,
the proofs satisfy the court that his conduct and declarations
led them to believe that he was content with the change
made, and that he would readily acquiesce in their doings
when the mill was completed, and, if so, he cannot be heard
to allege or prove the contrary to the prejudice of their
rights.*
Where a person tacitly encourages an act to be done, he
cannot afterwards exercise his legal right in opposition to
such consent, if his conduct or acts of encouragement induced the other party to change his position, so that he will
be pecuniarily prejudiced by the assertion of such adversary
claim.

1. The provision in the seventh amendment of the Constitution of the
United States, which declares that no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United States than according to
the rules of the common law, applies to the facts tried by a jury in a
cause in a State court.
2. So much of the 5th section of the act of Congress of March 3d, 1863, entitled "An act relating to habeas corpus and regulating proceedings in
certain cases," as provides for the removal of a judgment in a State

of the United States for a retrial on the facts and law, is not in pursuance of the Constitution, and is void.

Statement of the case,

imprisonment against Murray and Buckley in the Supreme
Court of the Third District of New York; to which the defendants pleaded the general issue, and pleaded further as
a special defence that the said Murray was marshal of the
Southern District of New York, and the said Buckley his
deputy; and that, as such marshal, he, Murray, was, by
order of the President, on or about the 28th August, 1862,
directed to take the plaintiff into custody; that the said
Buckley, as such deputy, was directed by him, the marshal,
to execute the said order; and that, acting as such deputy,
and in pursuance of his directions, he, Buckley, did, in a
lawful manner, and without force or violence, take the said
Patrie into custody; that during all the time he was in custody he was kept and detained in pursuance of said order
of the President, and not otherwise.
Issue being thus joined, the cause was tried at the Circuit
Court in Greene County, within the third judicial district,
before a jury. The defendants appeared by counsel. No
evidence was given on the trial, on the part of the defendants, in support of the special defence set up as being under
the order of the President. A verdict was rendered for the
plaintiff and judgment was regularly entered upon the verdict on the 8th June, 1864.
In December following a writ of error was issued to the
Supreme Court of the Third District, to remove the cause to
the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. The writ was issued under the 5th section of an act of Congress, passed March 3d, 1863, entitled
"An act relating to Habeas Corpus, and regulating proceedings in certain cases." The 5th section of this act provides
as follows:
"If 'any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, has been or shall
be commenced in any State court, against'any officer, civil or
military,' . . . or 'for any arrest or imprisonment made' .
'at any time during the present rebellion, by virtue or under
color of any authority by or under the President of the United
States,' . . . 'it shall' . . . 'be competent for either party, within
six months after the rendition of a judgment in any such cause,

by writ of error or other process, to remove the same to the
Circuit Court of the United States for that district in which
such judgment shall have been rendered; and the said Circuit
Court shall thereupon proceed to try and determine the facts
and law in such action in the same manner as if the same had
been there originally commenced, the judgment in such case
notwithstanding.'"
The State court refused to make a return to the writ of
error. Thereupon an alternative mandamus was issued by
the Circuit Court of the United States, to which a return
was made setting forth the suit, trial, and judgment already
referred to. To this there was a demurrer and joinder;
and, after due consideration, the demurrer was sustained,
and a judgment for a peremptory mandamus rendered.
From this judgment a writ of error was taken to this court.*
The case was argued on two occasions, and each time with
ability and care. On the first by Mr. A. J. Parker,for the
plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Eoarts, then Attorney-General,
contra ; and at this term, by Mr. Parker again, on one side as
before, and by ir. Hoar, now Attorney- General, with Mr. Field,
Assistant Attorney-General, on the other. On the second occasion the argument was confined to two questions submitted
by the court:
1. Whether or not the act of Congress of March 3d, 1863,
providing for the removal of a cause, after judgment by a
State court, to the Circuit Court of the United States, for a
new trial, is an act in pursuance of the Constitution of the
United States ?
2. Whether or not the provision in the seventh amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which declares
that no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined
The alternative and peremptory mandamus against the Supreme Court
of New York was allowed by consent of the counsel for the defendants, with
a view to present the question raised and decided in the case. The Circuit
Court had refused to issue it against the court, and issued it only against the
clerk. This is stated to prevent the case from being cited as an authority

for the power, and without intending to express any opinion on this subject. S. N.

Opinion of the court.

in any court of the United States than according to the rules
of the common law,'applies to the facts tried by a jury in a
cause in a State court ?
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
This case has received the most deliberate consideration
of the court. As we have arrived at the conclusion that the
seventh amendment, upon its true construction, applies to a
cause tried by a jury in a State court, this opinion will be
confined to considerations involved in the second question
submitted to us for argument at the bar. The decision of
that in the affirmative disposes of the case.
. The seventh amendment is as follows: "In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved; and no
fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any
court of the United States than according to the common
law."
It must be admitted that, according to the construction
uniformly given to the first clause of this amendment, the
suits there mentioned are confined to those in the Federal
courts; and the argument is, perhaps, more than plausible,
which is that the words, " and no fact tried by a jury," mentioned in the second, relate to the trial by jury as provided
for in the previous clause. We have felt the full force of
this argument, and if the two clauses were necessarily to be
construed together, and to be regarded as inseparable, we
think the argument would be conclusive. But this is not
the view that has been taken of it by this court. In Parsons
v. Bedford el al.,* Mr. Justice Story, in delivering the opinion
of the court, referring to this part of the amendment, observed, "that it should be read as a substantial and independent clause;" and that it was "a prohibition to the courts
of the United States to re-examine any facts tried by a jury
in any other manner." The history of the amendment confirms this view.t He further observed that "the only modes

known to the common law to re-examine such facts was the
granting of a new trial by the court where the issue was
tried, or the award of a venire facias de novo, by the appellate court, for some error of law that had intervened in the
proceedings."
Another argument mainly relied upon against this construction is that the ten amendments proposed by Congress,
and adopted by the Stittes, are limitations upon the powers
of the Federal government, and not upon the States; and
we are referred to the cases of Barron v. The Mayor and

City Council of Baltimore;* Lessee of Livingston v. Moore and
others;t Twitchell v. The Commonwealth,. as authorities for the
position. This is admitted, and it follows that the seventh
amendment could not be invoked in a State court to prohibit it from re-examining, on a writ of error, facts that had
been tried, by a jury in the court below. But this would
seem to be the only consequence deducible from these cases
or from the principles they assert. They have no pertinent,
much less authoritative, application to the question in hand.
That question is not whether the limitation in the amendment has any effect as to the powers of an appellate State
court, but what is its effect upon the powers of the Federal
appellate court? Is the limitation confined to cases of writs
of error to the inferior Federal courts, or does it not also
apply to writs of error to State courts in cases involving
Federal questions? The latter is the precise question for
our determination. Now, it will be admitted that the amendment, in terms, makes no such discrimination. They are:
"and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined
in any court of the United States than according to the rules
of the common law." It is admitted that the clause applies
to the appellate powers of the Supreme Court of the United
States in all common law cases coming up from an inferior
Federal court, and also to the Circuit Court in like cases, in
the exercise of its appellate powers. And why not, as it
respects the exercise of these powers in cases of Federal cog7 Peters, 243.

nizance coming up from a State court? The terms of the
amendment are .general, and contain no qualification in respect to the restriction upon the appellate jurisdiction of the
courts, except as to the class of cases, namely, suits at common law, where the trial has been by jury. The natural
inference is that no other was intended. Its language, upon
any reasonable, if not necessary, interpretation, we think,
applies to this entire class, no matter from what court the
case comes, of which cognizance can be taken by the appellate court.
It seems to us also that cases of Federal cognizance, coming up from State courts, are not only within the words, but
are also within the reason and policy of the amendment.
They are cases involving questions arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties, or under
some other Federal authority; and, therefore, are as cornpletely within the exercise of the judicial power of the United
States, as much so as if the cases had been originally brought
in some inferior Federal court. No other cases tried in the
State courts can be brought under the appellate jurisdiction
of this court or any inferior Federal court on which appellate jurisdiction may have been conferred. The case must
be one involving some Federal question, and itis difficult to
perceive any sensible reason for the distinction that is attempted to be made between the re-examination by the appellate court of a case coming up from an inferior Federal,
and one of the class above mentioned coming up from a
State court. In both instances the cases are to be disposed
of by the same system of laws and by the same judicial
tribunal.
Mr. Hamilton, in the 82d number of the Federalist, speak,
ing of the relation that would subsist between the National
and State courts in the instances of concurrent jurisdiction,
observes that the Constitution, in direct terms, gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the enume,
rated cases of Federal cognizance in which it is not to have
an original one, without a single expression to confine its
operations to the inferior Federal courts. The objects of

appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are
alone contemplated. From this circumstqnce, lie observes,
and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to
extend to the State tribunals. "The courts of the latter will,
of course, be National auxiliaries to the execution of the laws
of the Union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to
that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the
principles of National justice and the rules of National decisions."
This idea of calling to the aid of the Federal judiciary the
State tribunals, by leaving to them concurrent jurisdiction
in which Federal questions might be involved, with the right
of appeal to the Supreme Court, will be found to be extensively acted upon in the distribution of the judicial powers
of the United States in the act of 1789, known as the Judiciary Act. Besides the general concurrent jurisdiction in
the Judiciary Act, a striking instance of this is found in the
33d section of the act, which provides "that for any crime
or offence against the United States the offender may, by
any justice or judge of the United States, or by any justice
of the peace or other magistrate of any of the United States
where he may be found, agreeably to the usual mode of process against offenders in such State, and at the expense of
the United States, be arrested and imprisoned, or bailed, as
the case may be, for trial before such court of the United
States as by this act has cognizance of the offence." And a
series of acts were also passed in the earlier sessions of Congress, conferring upon the State and county courts cognizance to hear and determine upon offences, penalties, and
forfeitures, and for the collection of taxes and duties arising
and payable Under the revenue laws, or under a direct tax
or internal duties, and which were continued down till the
State courts refused to entertain jurisdiction of the same.*
The State courts of New York continued to exercise jurisdiction under these acts till as late as 1819.t
The reasons, therefore, for the application of this clause

THE JUSTICES V. MURRAY.
Opinion of the court.

of the seventh amendment to cases coming up for review
from the State courts were as strong as in cases from the
inferior Federal courts, and the history of the amendment
will show that it was the apprehension and alarm in respect
to the appellate jurisdiction of this court over cases tried by
a jury in the State courts that led mainly to its adoption.
The appellate jurisdiction of' this court, after defining its
original jurisdiction, is as follows:
"In all other cases before mentioned the Supreme Court
shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and faet, with
such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress
shall make."
Mr. Hamilton, in the 81st number of the Federalist, after
quoting the provision observes: "The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in
regard to matters of law, but the clamors have been loud
against it as applied to matters of fact. Some well-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the
language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been
induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial
by jury in favor of the civil law mode of trial." And he then
enters into an argument to show that there is no real ground
for alarm or apprehension on the subject, and suggests some
regulations by Congress by which the objections would be
removed. He observes, also, that it would have been impracticable for the Convention to have made an express exception of cases which had been originally tried by a jury,
because in the courts of some of the States all causes were
tried in this mode, and such exception would preclude the
revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper
as where it might be improper. He then suggests that Congress has full power to provide that in appeals to the Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of the facts
where the causes had been tried by a jury according to the
common law mode of proceeding. Now, it is quite clear
that the restrictions upon this appellate power by Congress,
pointed out by Mr. Hamilton for the purpose of quieting the
public mind, had a direct reference to the revision of the

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

judgments of the State courts as well as the inferior Federal,
and what is significant on the subject is, that the amendment submitted in the first session of Congress by Mr. Madison adopts the restriction suggested by Hamilton, and
almost in the same words. We will simply add, there is
nothing in the history of the amendment indicating that it
was intended to be confined to cases coming up for revision
from the inferior Federal courts, but much is there found to
the contrary.*
Our conclusion is, that so much of the 5th section of the
act of Congress, March 3d, 1863, entitled "An act relating
to habeas corpus, and regulating proceedings in certain
cases," as provides for the removal of a judgment in a State
court, and in which the cause was tried by a jury, to the
Circuit Court of the United States for a retrial on the facts
and law, is not in pursuance of the Constitution, and is void.
The judgment of the court below must, therefore, be
REVERSED, the cause remanded with direction to dismiss the
writ of error and all proceedings under it.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS V. WALKER
1. The act of Congress of July 27th, 1831, relinquishesto the State of Missouri the lots, commons, &c., reserved for the use of schools by the act
of June 12th, 1812, and nothing else.
2. The act of 1812 excluded from the reservation which it made, all lots
rightfully claimed by private persons, and the report of the Board of
Commissioners under the act of July 9th, 1832, in favor of such a claim
and its confirmation by Congress, is evidence that it was rightful.
8. The fact that such a claim was barred by the limitation of the act of 1824
did not prove that it was not a rightful claim, nor prevent Congress

from removing that bar, and allowing the claim to be proved and confirmed.
4. Such subsequent confirmation shows that the claim was a rightful one,
when the act of 1812 was passed, and that the lot claimed was not included in the reservation for schools.
