ALVISO V. UNITED STATES.

824

[Sup., Ct.

Opinion of the court.

At most, it can only be. regarded as an allowance of an
appeal at the June Term, 1865, and no citation appears to
have been issued since to the appellees, nor was there any
equivalent notice, nor has there been any waiver.
The appeal must therefore be
DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION.

ALVISO V.

UNITED STATES.

A citation to the adverse party, with due return or waiver by general aplearance, or otherwise, is indispensable to jurisdiction on appeal.
ON motion to dismiss an appeal from the District Court
for Northern California, the GHIEF JUSTICE stated the
ease and gave the opinion of the court.
The final decree in the District Court was rendered on
the 8th September, 1863, and an appeal was allowed, on
motion of the claimant, on the 18th November, 1863. Upon
this appeal no action was taken by the appellarits. On the
23d February, 1864, an appeal was again allowed, and the
record was brought to this court and filed November 11,
1864.
This was in time, but no citation was issued to the adverse party, and there is nothing to show any waiver; and a
citation, with due return, or waiver by general appearance
or otherwise, is indispensable to jurisdiction on appeal.*

The writ, therefore, must be
DISMISSED.
