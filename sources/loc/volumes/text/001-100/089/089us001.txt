DECISIONS
IN

THE

SUIPRIE COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
OCTOBER TERM, 1874.

GILL v. WELLS.
1. An original patent of one Wells, for a bat-body machine, among other
things, minutely described a specific device called a 11chamber" or
tunnel," composed of two side pieces, a bottom piece, and a top piece,
permanently united together, so as to form in fact a single tubular device,
and described minutely the functions which this device performed. A
reissued patent separated this "chamber or tunnel" into its several component parts, called by distinct names, viz., a "1bottom guide," and a
"top guide," and "side guides;" and ascribed independent functions
to each of these parts, and-claimed in succession each of these parts in
combination with other parts of the hat-body machine. At the same
time the description of this composite device, " the chamber or tunnel,"
and its functions as such, which were contained in the original patent,
were omitted entirely from the reissued specification. oBeld, that the reissued patent was invalid, as not being for the same invention as the
original patent.
2. A complete description was given in the originalpatent of the combination of the four parts which constituted the "1chamber or tunnel," and
that patent did not contain the slightest evidence that the patentee ever
made any other combination than that of all the four parts which together form this "1tunnel or chamber." Held. that in such case, even if
the patentee had subsequently discovered that he could accomplish a
new and useful result by a combination of some of the several parts included in this "tunnel or chamber," he could not surrender and reissue
his patent for this combination of a smaller number of the ingredients,
because the reissued patent in that event would not be for the same invention as the surrendered original.
3. Such a description of a combination of other parts, besides the first-mentioned, would constitute new matter, the introduction of which into the

specification of a reissued patent is forbidden by section fifty-three of
the Patent Act of 1870.
4. A patentee cannot legally surrender a patent for an invention consisting
of a combination of old ingredients, and amend the descriptive parts of
the specification by striking out the entire description of one of the ingredientsof the combination and inserting in lieu thereof afull description of several other devices, without any allegation that they are the
equivalents of the one whose description is stricken out.
5. The case of Gould v. Reese, 15 Wallace, 194, commented on.
6. An equivalent for the ingredient of a combination consist~ng wholly of
parts that are old must be one which was known at the date of the
original patent as a propersubstitute for the ingredient left out.
ERROR to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of
New York.
Mrs. Eliza Wells, administratrix of Henry A. Wells, sued
Gill at law for infringement of letters-patent fior an improvement in machinery for making hat-bodies. Original letterspatent had been granted to the said eHenry, April 25th, 1846.
The patent was reissued in 1856, in two parts, No. 396 and
No. 400, to an assignee of Wells, and was extended by the
Commissioner of Patents, April 17th, 1860; and again reissued in December, 1860, to the assignee of Wells, in No.
1086 and No. 1087. No. 1086 was again reissued to Burr,
June 17th, 1862, in No. 1318. On the 2d of March, 1867,
Nos. 1087 and 1318 were extended to Eliza Wells, as administratrix of Wells, by act of Congress; and on the 19th
of May, 1868,.No. 1087 was again reissued in No. 2942. On
this the present suit was founded.
The cause was tried upon the general issue, with notice
of certain special matters in defence, and a verdict for the
plaintiff below for nominal damages was rendered.
The defendant excepted to certain rulings, instructions,
and directions given below, and exceptions being taken the
case was now before this court.
The subject of hat-forming machines and the art relating
to the making of hats is set out by the present reporter in
the case of Burr v. Duryee,* which was a suit under a prior

reissue of the already mentioned patent of Wells; and it
is indispensable that the reader of the present case, unless
he has already a knowledge of the subject in some other
way, master the general history presented by that case, before he proceed with the present one.*
As stated in that case, Wells had been preceded by a machine of one Williams, in which there was a feed-apron for
carrying the fur, a disintegrater, a fur conductor, a rotating
cone, and an exhaust.
The Wells machine, as shown in his original patent and
in the model filed by him in the Patent Office, consisted of
certain parts org4nized together into a hat-forming machine,
which consisted of1st. Feed-aprons.
2d. A revolving brush.
3d. A tunnel or chamber.
4th. An upper hood and lower flap as adjuncts to the
trunk.
5th. An exhaust, rotating, perforated cone.
These several parts aie shown combined in Fig. 1, which
is a copy of Wells's original patent drawing.
The functions of these several parts and their mode of
operation were thus set out in the original patent of Wells:
"(My improvements consist in feeding the fur (called the
stock) after it has been picked, to a rotating brush between two
endless belts of cloth, one above the other, the lower one horizontal and the upper inclined, to gradually compress the fur
and gripe it more effectually where it is presented to the'action
of the rotating brush, which, moving at a great velocity, throws
it in a chamber or tunnel which is gradually changed in form
towards the outlet, where it assumes a shape nearly corresponding to a vertical section passing through the axis of the cone,
but narrower, for the purpose of concentrating and directing
* For the better understanding of that case, the reporter deems it well to
say that " the figure" referred to on page 650 of that report (in the 7th and
8th lines from the top of the page just named), is figure 21 on page 560, and
not figure 10 on page 549, as might not unnaturally be supposed. The matter
is put rightly in late editions of Volume I, but is not so in earlier editions.

Statement of the case.

the fur thrown by the brush on to the cone; this casing being
provided with an aperture immediately under the brush, through
which a current of air enters in consequence of the rotation of
the brush and the exhaustion of the cone, for the purpose of
more effectually directing the fibres towards the cone, which is
placed just in front of the delivery aperture of the chamber or
tunnel, which aperture is provided at top with a bonnet or
hood hinged thereto, and at the bottom with a hinged flap, to
regulate the deposit of the fibres on the cone or other former,
with a view to distribute the thickness of the bat wherever
more is required to give additional strength."
It will be seen that the marked feature of this invention
here set out was a tunnel or chamber placed between the revolving brush disintegrating mechanism and the revolving
perforated cone, this tunnel being adapted to collect or receive' the fur from the disintegrating brush, to convey it
towards the cone, and then to discharge it in a concentrated
form against the revolving cone. The tunnel had an opening in front, under the revolving brush, through which a
current of air entered. This current of air, constrained by
the casing or walls of the tunnel, was plainly the direct
agent in conveying the fibres to and discharging them on to
the cone.
This tunnel was represented in the original model and
patent as an integral structure, as shown in Fig. 2; and
FIG. 2.

although, like all tubular structures of rectangular section,
it had a bottom and top and two sides, yet these were shown
as made of uniform material and united rigidly and permanently together.
The patent also described two movable adjuncts to the

Statement of the case.

discharging end of the tunnel, one called the "hinged hood,"
placed above, and the other called the "hingedflap," placed
below. The hinged hood is shown in Fig. I at s, and the
hinged flap at q.
Nothing was said in the original specification to lead one
to suppose that,any result whatever could be accomplished
without the union of the bottom, the sides, and the top into
this integral structure called the "chamber" or "tunnel,;"
and the interposition .of that "tunnel" between the disintegrating brush, F, and the pervious vacuum cone, 0.
Mforeover it was not suggested in the original patent, nor
was there anything to lead any one to suppose that if the
tunnel or chamber was entirely removed the feeding mechanism and the disintegrating apparatus *could in any useful
way whatever co-operate with the pervious cone.
There were four claims of this patent relating to the
mechanism.
The first claim of the original patent of 1846 pointed
clearly to a combination of the peculiar feeding mechanism,
bbl, the disintegrating brush, F, and the tunnel or chamber, H, in front of the brush.
The second claim pointed at the combination of the chamber or tunnel, Al, and the perforated cone, 0, in front of it.
The third claim pointed at the combination of the tunnel
or chamber, M, and the upper hinged hood, S.
The fourth claim pointed at the combination of the tunnel
or chamber, 1/, with the lower hinged flap, y.
It will be observed that into each of the four combiiiations set out in the four claims above respectively, the entire tunnel or chamber (composed of a bottom, sides, and
top, united together) entered as an integral device.
The first feature of invention chmed looked to the function which, as an integraldevice, this tunnel performed at its
receiving end with reference to the feeding and disintegrating brush.
The second feature claimed looked to the function which
this same tunnel as an integral device performed, at the discharging end, in reference to the perforated vacuum cone.

Oct. 1874.]

GILL V. WELLS.
Statement of the case.

The third and fourth features claimed respectively concerned this same tunnel as an integral device, viewed in connection with the movable adjuncts at the upper and lower
part of its discharging end.
In the several successive reissues of this patent, granted
in 1856, April 17th, 1860, and December, 1860, this device
was called a "tunnel or chamber;" was uniformly described
as an integral device, and no hint was given that it could be
entirely removed or that it could be separated into its elementary parts, and that either of its several elementary
parts could alone perfbrm any useful purpose in connection with the disintegrating brush and cone. After the
patent had been extended by Congress, the extended patent
was reissued May 19th, 1868 (that is to say, twenty-two years
after the date of the original patent), with specification No.
2942, presenting two distinct features of invention not exhibited in the original patent or in any prior reissue, viz. :
1st, that there existed in the Wells invention a direct combination between the feeding machinery, the disintegrating
brush, and the pervious cone, independent of any intermediate device between the disintegrating brush and the
'cone. Such a combination would be represented to the
mind by dropping out the chamber or tunnel from the
Wells patent, drawing Fig. 1, at page 4, supra, and thus
producing
FIG. 3.

A special claim, No. 4, was inserted in this reissue to
point out and secure this combination to the representatives
of Wells. It was in the following language:

GILL V. WELLS.

[Sup. Ct,

Statement of the case.
FOURTH CLAIM3.

"The combination of the feeding apron, on which the fur
can be placed in separate batches as described, the rotating
brush or picker substantially as described, the rotating cone, or
'former,' provided with an exhausting mechanism substantially
as described; the said combination having a mode of operation
substantially such as described."
The second marked change in this last reissue, No. 2942,
from either of its predecessors was the omitting from the
specification the words "tunnel or chamber" always theretofore present in the specifications, and employing no distinctive term as applicable thereto as an integral device. At
the same time that all mention of this integral device theretofore called the "tunnel or chamber" disappeared from the
specification, that device in the new description was split
up into four parts, each of which parts was treated as if it
was in itself an integral device; and a specific designation
was given to each part. Thus, instead of it being stated as
it had been done in the previous issues that there was a
"tunnel or chamber" extending from the brush toward the
cone, it was stated in the last reissue that "from, the under
part of the rotating brush x x, there isa plate f, which extends
towards the pervious cone." Again, it was stated that "there
is an upper guide or deflector r, which extends over the rotating brush forward of it toward the cone." Again, it was
stated that "on each side there is a guide m, extending from
the picker brush toward the cone." These devices, called
respectively for the first time in this reissue ";platef or bottom plate," "upper guide or top guide," and "guide m or side
guides," had no names or designation by letters or otherwise
whatsoever given to them in either of the prior reissues.
Moreover, all statement of the function performed by the
"tunnel or chamber" regarded as an integral device, which
function had been theretofore regarded as the mode of opera,lion of the Wells machine, disappeared in this reissue, and
special functions were assigned to each of these parts, thus
treated as integral devices in this reissue. Finally, in the
claiming part of the specification, combinations between

each of these several newly recognized integers and the
other parts of the machine were carved out. Thus, Claim
1 covered the combination of the disintegrating brush, the

"bottom plate or guide ff," and the rotating pervious vacuum
cone.

This combination would be shown by
FIG. 4.

Claim 1 was in the following language:
"The combination of the rotating brush or picker, substantially such as described, the rotating pervious cone, provided
with an exhausting mechanism substantially as described, and
the bottom plate or guide substantially as described for directing
the fur fibres towards the lower part of the cone, and preventing the fibres going to waste, the said combination having the
mode of operation specified, and for the purpose set forth."
Claim 2 covered the combination of the feeding mectanism, the disintegrating brush or mechanism, the " top guide
or deflector," and the pervious vacuum cone. This combination would be shown in Fig. 5.
FIG. 5.

This Claim 2 was in these words:
"The combination of the feed-apron, the rotating brush or

picker, substantially as described, the rotating pervious cone,
provided with an exhausting mechanism, substantially as described, and the guide or deflector, for directingfur fibre on to the
tip and upper part of the cone, substantially as described; the
said combination having the mode of operation specified, and
for the purpose set forth."
Claim 3 embraced the combination of the disintegrating
mechanism, the "side guides or either of them," and the
pervious vacuum cone. This combination in an alternate

form would be illustrated by Fig. 6, where only one side
guide is involved, and by Fig. 7, where both side guides
are shown.
FIG. 7.

Claim 3 was in these words:
"The combination of the rotating brush or picker, substantially as described, the rotating pervious cone provided with an
exhausting mechanism, substantially as described, and the side
guides, or either of them, substantially as described, to prevent
fur fibres from getting out of the proper influence of the current travelling to the cone, and to protect the travelling fibres
from disturbing currents; the said combination having the mod-of operation specified, and for the purpose set forth."

GILL V. WELLS.
Statement of the case.

Such being the claims of this reissue, lNo. 2942, oil which
the present suit was brought, it becomes necessary to describe the defendant's machine; the machine, namely, alleged to have infringed. It consisted of a machine shown
in Fig. 8.

This machine had a single feed-apron A, a rotating picker
B, which revolved in the direction shown by the arrow,

throwing the fur against a "cut-off board" -.
FIG. 8.

The fur is carried to the machine on the feeding apron A,
and passes between rollers C and D, and by the action of the
picker cylinder B, it is thrown against a cut-off board ,
whence it passes into the top of box I The fan T creates a
blast in the direction of the respective arrows, drawing the
air and fur in the box I downwards, and as this current of
air passes through the apertures in the cone the fur is deposited on said cone N .
The current of air can be regulated by means of the reg-

isters S, which are 'ithiu the cone N, the lower one of which
can be-turned on shaft B, and serves to open or close the
apertures of the upper disk so as to produce a current of
air of the desired strength.
The court below, after describing to the jury the Wells
"trunk," consisting of a bottom, top, and sides, and its
mode of operation as a "trunk," proceeded to charge them
as follows:
"Now, gentlemen, having said what I have in relation to the
combination of the three parts to the trunk, this instrumentality
for controlling the passage of the fur from the picker to the
cone, and mode of restraining this fur, so it shall not go to waste,
and which is claimed to be new, you will perceive that it consists of a top, bottom, and sides; I have been asked to say to
you that it is essential to a just construction of this patent that
those sides should be united. No doubt that they are united in
the model that is produced; and if the dividing of them into
four pieces would make no substantial change, if the instrumentality would be the same substantially, and operate in the
same mode, no man could sever them and say he was not an infringer; and if not then the union of the edges at the corners
is not of the substance of the invention. Therefore, I am not
able to say that one has not infringed who did not use a trunk
that was constructed with its corners solid or united in the
manner that is here exhibited. If I had a case of that sort I
should submit to you the question whether a man who took the
thing as we see it here and divided it at the corners, and set it
up, had made anything more than an attempt, colorable, to evade
the patent, without producing any substantial difference, either
in the *instrumentality or in the mode in which the result was
effected.
"Such being the model which is produced here-for if you perceive that, in any respect, I have erroneously conceived it or
misstated it, you will correct me-I have only recurred to it for
the purpose of giving application to the views, mainly of law,
bearing upon the question. I say this being substantially an
account of the machine which Mrs. Wells, the plaintiff, patented
in the reissue, which is the foundation of this suit, has, for
reasons doubtless sufficient to her, divided the claim of the
specification into several parts, and she has done so apparently

GILL V. WELLS.
Statement of the case.

under the idea that if she dealt with the machine as a unit, as
an aggregate, the invention might be appropriated with impunity by a party vho used a portion of its effective, original, and
useful parts, leaving out some others. An inventor is at liberty
when he has made an invention, if it consists of several distinct, effective, new devices, which as an aggregate, may constitute, in his judgment, the best machine in the world, but of
which certain of the parts may be omitted, and it still be an
effective, new, and useful machine-I say that the inventor is
at liberty, in taking out his patent, to protect himself against
that species of innovation by claiming the separate, new, and
useful parts of the machine by themselves.
"For illustration. A party patenting a machine may introduce ingenious and new devices which may be better than any
other for the purpose, but some of which could be supplied by
old devices, if he patents the machine and the combination containing his new devices, patents only a combination. A party
who might think he could make a machine substantially useful
for his purpose by omitting these devices, and supplying their
places by old devices, having different operation and character,
would be at liberty to do so, and thus, practically, a large benefit, or perhaps the whole benefit that is due the inventor might
be lost. I say the patent law, therefore, permits the inventor
not only to patent the machine as an aggregate, but to patent
the new devices which enter into it, so that another may not avail
himself of his ingenuity in that respect. That is the reason
why reissues often become necessary, because in the original
patent, the party did not claim distinctly the separate items of
the property which he had a right to claim. And, in that view,
I suppose the plaintiff here has claimed the combination of the
rotating brush or picker, substantially as described, the rotating
pervious cone, provided with an exhausting mechanism, substantially as described; and the bottom-plate or guide, substantially
as described, of which is called the trunk for directing the fur
fibres toward the lower part of the cone, and preventing the
fibres going to waste, which combination has the mode of operation specified and for the purpose set forth."
Upon this instruction of the court below, and upon the
refusal of the court below to instruct the jury that the reissued patent, No. 2942, was invalid because it was not for

the same invention as the original patent-matters to which
the defendant excepted-the first principal decision of this
court is based.
The only other matters assigned for error and noticed by
the court wereThat the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that
the defendant's machines did not infringe the fourth claim
of the plaintiff's patent, unless it had the feeding device of
the original patent in combination with the rotating brush
or picker and the pervious cone, and the chamber or tunnel
described in the original specification.
That the court erred in instructing the jury that the reissued patent is valid, as respects the fourth claim, if the
combination of the three ingredients therein mentioned was
new, and could be usefully employed for the purpose of facilitating the making of hat-bodies, supplemented by any known
means of guiding the fur in such a way as to bring, by the operation of these three devices, the fur to the cone so as to make
a hat-body, or if those three devices would make a hat-body
without the aid of other means of protecting the fur against
escape that would be serviceable for any purpose, then it
was patentable, even without the trunk, which is also called
the chamber or tunnel.

error; Messrs. -. IV. Dickerson and M. K. Brewer, contra.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Valid letters-patent may be gi'anted for an invention which
consists entirely in a new combination of old ingredients,
provided it appears that the new combination of the ingredients produces a new and useful result; but the rule is
equally well settled, in such a case, that the invention consists merely in the new combination of the ingredients, and
that a suit for an infringement cannot be maintained against
a party who constructs or uses a substantially different cornbination, even though it includes the exact same ingredients.

formal, do not constitute a defence to the charge of infringement, as the inventor of a new and useful combination of
old ingredients is as much entitled to claim equivalents as any
other class of inventors, but they cannot suppress subsequent
improvements which are substantially different from their
inventions, whether the new improvement consists in a new
combination of the same ingredients or of some newly discovered ingredient, or even of some old ingredient performing some new function not known at the date of the letterspatent as a proper substitute for the ingredient withdrawn.
Old ingredients known at the date of letters-paten t granted
for an invention, consisting of a new combination of old ingredients, if also known at that date as a proper substitute
for one or more of the ingredients of the invention secured
by the letters-patent, are the equivalents of the corresponding ingredients of the patented combination. Such old ingredients, so known at the date of the letters-patent granted,
are the equivalents of the ingredients of the patented combination, and no others, and it may be added that that, and
that only, is what is meant by the rule that inventors of a
new combination of old ingredients are as much entitled to
claim equivalents as any other class of inventors.
Reissued patents, in order that they may be valid, must
be for the same invention as the surrendered originals. Inoperative or invalid patents, which are so by reason of a defective or insufficient specification, or by reason that the
patentee claimed as his own invention or discovery more
than he had a right to claim as new, may be surrendered if
the error arose by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, and
without any firaudulent or deceptive intention, and the provision is that the Commissioner, in that event, shall, upon
the payment of the sum required by law, cause a new patent
for the same invention, and in accordance with the corrected
specification, to be issued to the proper party, as prescribed
in the fifty-third section of the Patent Act.*
Unquestionably the specifications in such a case may be

amended to correct an error which has arisen by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, if without any fraudulent or
deceptive intention, but the express provision in the new
Patent Act is that no new matter shall be introduced into
the specification, and that in the case of a patent for a machine neither the model nor drawings shall be amended, except each by the other, which is a very impoitant provision
to secure the fulfilment of the condition that the reissued
patent shall be for the same invention as that secured by
the original patent.
Matters of law only are in dispute here between the parties, as the judgment of the Circuit Court was rendered in a
suit at law for the infringement of a patent, and the cause
was removed into this court by a writ of error to revise the
rulings and instructions of the circuit judge, but it will be
necessary to refer somewhat fully to the specification of the
original patent, and to compare the same with the specification of the reissued patent, which is the patent in suit, in
order to understand the exact nature and scope of the controlling questions presented for decision.
Exact description of the invention was given in the specification of the original patent, which affords the most ample
means to define the nature and scope of the improvement
actually made by the patentee as secured by that patent.
My improvements, he says, consist in feeding the fur after
it has been picked to a rotating brush, between two endless
belts of cloth, one above the other, the lower one horizontal
and the upper one inclined to gradually compress the fur
and gripe it more effectually where it is presented to the
rotating brush, which moves at great velocity and throws it
into a chamber or tunnel which is gradually changed in form
towards the outlet, where it assumes a shape nearly corresponding to a vertical section passing through the axis of the
cone, but growing narrower, for the purpose of concentrating and directing the fur thrown by the brush to the cone.
Currents of air enter at the same time through an aperture immediately under the brush, in consequence of the
rotation of the brush and the exhaustion of the cone, for the

purpose of more efectually directing the fibres towards the
cone, which is placed just in front of the delivery aperture
of the chamber or tunnel, which aperture is provided at the
top with a bonnet or hood, hinged thereto, and at the bottom
with the hinged flap to regulate the deposit of the fibres on
the cone or other former with the view to distribute the
thickness of the bat wherever more is required to give additional strength to the manufacture.
Means are also described for holding the fibres composing
the bgt on to the cone, so that the bat may be removed from
the cone or former before the hardening process is applied,
and for that purpose the representation is that the patentee
first covers it with felted or fulled cloth, and then he employs
one or two metallic cones, one to put over the bat after it
has been surrounded with the moist cloth, for the purpose
of making pressure on the fibres and to allow hot water to
circulate when the whole is immersed therein to harden the
bat preparatory to felting, and the other metallic cone is to
be placed within the perforated one on which the hat has
been formed, and which is necessarily thin and weak, for the
purpose of resisting the pressure of the surrounding water,
consequent upon a partial vacuum produced within, when
the whole is withdrawn from the water.
Special reference is then made to the drawings and a detailed description is given of everydevice included in the
apparatus and of the functions which the respective.devices
of the apparatus perform. Superadded to those details is a
general description of the mode in which the described apparatus operates and of the result which it acconiplishes, in
substance as follows: As the fibres are first presented they
are acted upon by the brush, which moves with great velocity, and they are properly laid by its downward action,
but when liberated they are carried down the curved surface
of the chamber or tunnel, and at the lower edge of that device they meet a current of air that enters a narrow aperture
near the bottom of the chamber.or tunnel, which extends
the whole length of the brush, and prevents the fibres from.

falling and resting on the bottom of the chamber or tunnel
:and carries them on to the perforated cone.
Minute description is also given of the chamber or tunnel
and of its appendages and of the functions which it performs,
as follows: That it extends over and under the brush and is
so arranged as to have a slight motion the axis of which is
the same as that of the brush, and that its bottom rests on
set-screws to regulate the delivery end of the same relatively
to the cone; that its forward end is provided with a hinged
flap regulated by a cam lever as the means of regulating the
delivery of the fibres; that its top is gradually elevated and
that the sides are contracted to make the delivery aperture
nearly of the form of the cone but narrower and higher;
that its upper part is provided with a hood so curved as to
correspond generally with the curve of the top of the cone.
Particular description is also given of the mode in which
the hood is arranged and of the functions which it performs,
as follows: That it is hinged to the upper part of the delivery aperture of the chamber and that it is connected with
an eccentric by means of a cord and bell-crank passing over
a pulley, so that each revolution of the eccentric carries the
hood up and down to direct the discharge of the fibres and
to distribute the same on to the cone, giving a greater thickness in the parts of the hat which form the brim and edge
than on the top and crown, and he suggests the means to be
employed by the manufacturer when it is.desired still further to diversify the distribution of the fibres.
Intelligent description is also given of the cone and of the
functions which it performs, and of the whole mode of operation from the time the fibres are placed upon the feed-apron
until the hat is formed, but there is no trace of any suggestion or intimation that the operation can be performed or
the patented result be produced without the chamber or
tunnel. Instead of that it is unquestionably true that the
chamber or tunnel is a material ingredient of the combination and an essential feature of the described invention.
Unmistakable support to that view, if any be needed beyond
what is disclosed in the description given of the same, is

also derived from the claims of the patent, three of which
in express terms describe the invention as a combination,
and include the chamber or tuniel as one of the ingredients
of the combination. Besides the evidence in that direction,
derived from the first three claims, the fourth claim is for
the employment of the hinged hood to regulate the proper
distribution of the fibres, which device is obviously but a
mere appendage of the chamber or tunnel in terms included
in the described combination.
Such a combination, if new and useful, and if it produces
a new and useful result, is the proper subject of a patent to
secure to the owner or proprietor the exclusive right to
make, use, and vend the thing patented for the period allowed by the Patent Act. Beyond doubt such a patent is
valid and operative, but the rights of the patentee under it
differ in one respect from those of a patentee for an invention which consists of an entire machine, or of a new and
useful device, as the rights of a patentee for a mere combination of old ingredients are not infringed unless it appears
that the alleged infringer made or used the entire patented
combination.*
Invalid and inoperative patents may be surrendered and
reissued for the same invention, but Congress never intended that a patent which was valid and operative should
be reissued merely to afford the patentee an opportunity to
expand the exclusive privileges which it secures, to enable
him to suppress subsequent improvements which do not conflict with the invention described in the surrendered patent.
Evidence of a decisive character to negative the theory that
such a practice finds any support in the act of Congress, besides what existed before, is found in the new Patent Act,
which expressly provides that no new matter shall be introduced into the specification; and in case of a machine patent,
that neither the model nor the drawings shall be amended
except each by the other.

considered. They are in substance and effect as follows:
(1.) That the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that
the reissued patent is invalid because it is not for the same
invention as the original. (2.) That the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the defendant's machine did not
infringe the fourth claim of the plaintiff's patent unless it
had the feeding device of the original patent in combination
with the rotating brush or picker and the pervious cone and
the chamber or tunnel described in the original specification. (3.) That the court erred in instructing the jury that
the reissued patent is valid as respects the fourth claim if
the combination of the three ingredients therein mentioned
was new and could be usefully employed for the purpose of
facilitating the making of hat-bodies, supplemented by any
known means of guiding the fur in such a way as to bring,
by the operation of these three devices, the fur to the cone so
as to make a hat-body, or if those three devices would make
a bat-body without the aid of other means of protecting the
fur against escape that would be serviceable for any purpose,
then it was patentable, even without the trunk, which is
also called the chamber or tunnel.
Three or more important propositions of patent law are
involved in the exceptions covered by the assignment of
errors, which it becomes important to restate with some
care, because neither the prayers for instructions, nor the
rulings of the court in refusing the same, nor the instructions given, nor the assignment of errors are in every respect free from ambiguity.
Perhaps no one of the prayers for instruction corresponds
in precise terms with either of the first two propositions,
but it is nevertheless true that many of them, as applied to
the separate claims of the patent, did raise the questions involved in those propositions, and it is equally certain that
the court in several instances ruled to the effect that the reissued patent was not invalid for the reason assigned, and
that the machine of the defendant did infringe that of the
plaintiff, even though it did not contain the chamber or
tunnel described in the plaintiff's original specification.

Oct. 1874.]

GILL V. WELLS.
Opinion of the edurt.

Filled as the record is with proofs to establish the truth of
the preceding statements, further argument upon the subject
is unnecessary. Throughout the triial it was the constant
aim of the defendant to defeat the plaintiff's action upon the
three grounds mentioned: (1.) That the reissued patent was
invalid because it was not for the same invention as the
original. (2.) That the defendant did not infringe the plaintiff's invention because his machine did not contain the
chamber or tunnel of the plaintiff's invention, nor its appendages. (3.) That the reissued patent was invalid as it
respects the fourth claim of the same, because the combination contains only three of the four ingredients described in
the original specification, and does not include either the
chamber or tunnel or its appendages.
Unquestionably these several defences were pressed in
many forms, and all must agree that the court refused to
sustain any one or all of them as often as they were presented by the defendant.
Attention will next be called to the specification of the
reissued patent as the best means by which to determine
whether the invention secured by it is or is not the same as
that of the original. Wide differences between the two
specifications are manifest in two important particulars.
1. That the whole description of the chamber or tunnel
and its appendages is left out of the specification of the reissued patent, and that it contains a full description of other
devices different from the chamber, in form at least, to perform the functions of the chamber and its appendages as
described in the original specification.
Material matters are left out of the specification when
compared with the original, and it is beyond dispute that
new features are introduced in the description of the devices
to be employed in guiding the fibres of the fur when taken
from the feeding mechanism by the rotating brush or picker.
They are picked and thrown towards the cone as in the
other specification, in which it has already appeared that the
representation is that they are guided and directed in the
manner and for the purpose specified by the chamber and

GILL V. WELLS.

ESup. Ct.

its appendages. Instead of that the description in the reissued specification is that the function of guiding and directing the fur is effected by the following means. Nothing
is said about the chamber, but the description is that a plate
is provided and placed under the brush, and that it 'extends
towards the pervious cone, an open space being left between
that end of the plate which is nearest the picker and the
concave part below the feeding mechanism that a current
of air may enter freely to assist in carrying the fibres towards
the cone as they are thrown by the brush or picker, and the
further representation is that the plate guides the fibres as
they are travelling and prevents too great an accumulatiou
of them immediately around the lower edge of the cone, the
greatest thickness of the bat being required to be deposited
some distance above, that the bat when made may be thickest
at and about the junction of the rim and crown, technically
termed the band, and that it also prevents waste, as otherwise many of the fibres would be carried by the force of
gravity below the influence of the currents travelling towards
the cone, particularly towards the close of the operation,
when the currents induced by the exhausting fan become
very faint.
Description is then given of the mode in wich the plate
is adjusted and of the functions which it performs, as follows: That it rests on an adjusting screw, so that that end
of it which is nearest the cone can be readily elevated or
depressed relatively to the base of the cone, as it may be
desired to vary the distribution of the fibres with a view to
make hats with a broad or narrow rim and with the rim
thicker or thinner relatively to the other parts, the plate
being made in two parts with a view to facilitate the distribution, the part beyond the supporting screw and nearest
the cone being hinged to the other part and being provided
with a cam or lever or other equivalent device.
Provision is also made for a device called an upper guide or
deflector, which, as the representation is, extends from the
feeding mechanism over the rotating brush or picker and forward of it towards the cone to direct the fibres and effect a

Opinion of the court.

proper distribution of them on the top of the cone and down
the sides thereof towards the base; and the further representation is that the under surface of that guide or deflector
nearest the picker-brush is flat or parallel with the axis of
the picker-brush, and thence, towards the other end, concave and of a gradually increasing concavity towards the
cone, and that the apparatus may be supplied with an additional deflector further to diversify the distribution of the
fibres, somewhat in the form of a hood, which is hinged to the
end of the deflector nearest the cone, so that it can be moved
by a cord passing over a pulley or a lever actuated by an
eccentric or a cam on a shaft. Guides are also provided on,
each side of the deflector, extending from the picker-brush
towards the cone, to prevent the fur fibres froni escaping
laterally out of the proper influence of the currents which
are travelling towards the cone, and which otherwise would
go to waste, and also to prevent the fibres which are travelling towards the cone from being disturbed by lateral or
foreign currents, not induced by the rotating brush or picker
or by the exhausting of the cone.
No allusion even is made to the chamber or tunnel in describing the apparatus for guiding and directing the fibres
thrown by the rotating brush or picker except at the conclusion of the description, where the patentee states that in,
the machine illustrated by the accompanying drawings the
bottom plate, top guides or deflector, and side guides are all
united along their edges, which is an express admission that
it is the chamber or tunnel and its appendages in the original specification that performs all these functions, and that
the description given in the reissued patent is a new feature,
describing devices different in form and with different names
from the description given of the means to accomplish the
same end in the original patent.
Differences so wide between an original and a reissued
patent show that it was a bold measure to grant, as well as.
to ask for, such a reissue. Examples of the kind, if any, it
is believed are very few in which such a reissued patent has
been granted where there is not a word in the original speci-

Opinion of the court.

fication to suppolt the theory that the patentee ever invented
anything except his described combination, which it is admitted consisted of four ingredients, all of which were old.
Complete description is given in the original specificationof that combination, but the specification does not contain
the slightest evidence that the patentee ever made any other
combination than that which embodies the four described
ingredients.
Cases arise where a patentee, having invented a new and
useful combination consisting of several ingredients which
in combination compose an organized machine, also claims
to have invented new and useful combinations of fewer
numbers of the ingredients, and in such cases the law is well
settled that if the several combinations are new and useful,
and will severally produce new and useful results, the inventor is entitled to a patent for the several combinations,
provided that he complies with the requirement of the Patent
Act and files in the Patent Office a written description of
each of the alleged new and useful combinations, and of the
manner of making, constructing, and using the same.
He may give the description of the several combinations
in one specification, and in that event he can secure the full
benefit of the exclusive right to each of the several inventions by separate claims referring back to the description in
the specification; and if by inadvertence, accident, or mistake, he should fail to claim any one of the described combinations, he may surrender the original patent and have a
reissue not only for the combination or combinations claimed
in the original, but for any which were so omitted in the
claims of the original patent.
Very different rules, however, apply in a case where the
only invention described in the original patent is the one
which includes all the ingredients of the machine, provided
there is no suggestion, indication, or intimation that any
other invention of any kind has been made. Such a patentee
as the one last mentioned may subsequently discover that he

can accomplish a new and useful result by a combination
embracing less than the whole number of the ingredients

GILL V. WELLS.
Opinion of the court.

included in the prior patented combination, but he cannot
secure the right and privilege of a patentee in the combination of the smaller number of the ingredients by a surrender
of his first patent and a reissue of the same which shall include the second combination as well as the first, because
the reissued patent in that event would not be for the same
invention as the surrendered original.*
Nov could that change be allowed under the present
Patent Act for another reason equally decisive, which is
that the description of'the other combinations, beside the
first, would constitute a new matter, the introduction of
which into the specification of a reissued patent is expressly
forbidden by the fifty-tbird section of that act. Such a prohibitory provision, it should be remembered, is new and
was not in force when the reissued patent in suit was
granted.t
NTone of the prior patent acts contained any such prohibition, but they all provided in terms that the reissued patent
must be for the same invention as the original, and that the
inventor before he shall receive a patent for his invention,
shall file in the Patent Office a written description of the
same and of the manner of making, constructing, and using
the same, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to
enable any person skilled in the art to make, construct, and
use the invention.
Where the ingredients are all old the invention in such a
case consists entirely in the combination, and the requirement of the Patent Act that the invention shall be fully and
exactly described applies with as much force to such an'invention as to any other class, because if not fulfilled all three
of the great ends intended to be accomplished by that requirement would be defeated. They are as follows: (1.)
That the government may know what they have granted
and what will become public property when the terni of the
monopoly expires. (2.) That licensed persons desiring to
practice the invention may know, during the term, how to
make, construct, and use the invention. (8.) That other in* Vance v. Campbell, 1 Black, 428.

ventors may know what part of the field of invention is unoccupied.
Purposes such as these are of great importance in every
case, but the fulfilment of them is never more necessary
than when such inquiries arise in respect to a patent for a
machine which consists of a combination of old ingredients.
Patents of that kind are much more numerous than any
other, and consequently it is of the greatest importance that
the description of the combination, which is the invention,
should be full, clear, concise, and exact.
Patient search has been made in vain for any trace of the
description of any other invention in the original patent
than that of the combination of all the ipgredients of the
apparatus described by the patentee as the one used by him
to effect the described patented result. 'Unable to discover
in that specification any description of any other invention
than that, the court is of the opinion that none other was
secured by the original patent.
Argument to show that an invention consisting of a combination of three ingredients which are old is not the same
as that of a combination of four old ingredients is quite unnecessary, as the negative of the proposition is as well settled
in the patent law as it is in mathematics. In Vance v.
Canpbell* four propositions were decided which have an important application to the case before the court: (1.) That
a patentee in a suit for an infringement of an invention consisting of a combination of old ingredients cannot in his
proofs abandon a part of such combination and maintain his
claim to the rest, for the reason that unless the patented
combination is maintained the whole of the invention fails.
(2.) That the patentee in such a suit cannot be allowed to
prove that any part of the combination is immaterial or useless. (3.) That the combination is an entirety, and that if
one of the ingredients be given up the thing claimed disappears, which is an obvious truth, as the invention in such a
case consists simply in the combination. (4.) That the clause
which provides that the suit shall not be defeated where the

patentee claims more than he has invented, in case he shall
disclaim such part, applies only where the part invented can
be clearly distinguished from that improperly claimed, which
shows that the clause cannot apply to a patent granted for
an invention consisting of a combination of old ingredients.*
Enough has already been remarked to show that all the
principal claims of the original patent recognize the chamber
or tunnel and its appendages as one of the primary ingredients of the patented invention, and it is absolulely certain
that the specification of that patent contains neither suggestion, indication, nor intimation that the original patentee
made any other invention to accomplish the described functions than the one which includes the whole four described
ingredients.
Suppose that it is so, still it is insisted by the plaintiff that
the plate, deflector, and side guides which are described in
the specification of the reissued patent are substantially the
same thing as the chamber or tunnel of the original patent,
and that those devices taken together are legally to be regarded as the equivalent of the chamber or tunnel and its
appendages as described in the specification of the original
patent.
Even a glance at the original specification is sufficient to
show that it does not contain any description whatever of
the plate, deflector, or side guides mentioned in the specification of the reissued patent, nor is it pretended that if the
several devices named had been described in the original
specification the description of these several devices would
have been a good description of the chamber or tunnel and
its appendages which are embraced in the invention secured
by that patent within the meaning of the act of Congress,
which requires that the description shall be full, clear, concise, and exact. Clearly it could not be, as it would not
accomplish any one of the three great purposes before named
as the purposes for which the description is required.
Equivalents are doubtless allowed to a patentee or owner

of the patent to shut out infringements, but the Patent Act
furnishes no support to the theory that the patentee may
surrender a patent for an invention consisting of a combination of old ingredients, and amend the descriptive parts
of the specification by striking otit the entire description of
one of the ingredients of the combination and inserting in
lieu thereof a full description of several other devices without any allegation that they are the equivalents of the one
whose description is stricken out, or any explanation whatever showing the reason why the change was made.
Whether one device is or is not an equivalent for another
is usually a question of fact, and often becomes a difficult
issue to decide. Grave doubts were at one time entertained
whether the patentee of an invention consisting of a combination of old ingredients was entitled to equivalents, but it
is now well settled that he is just as much as the patentee
of any other class of inventions; but it is very important
to understand what is meant by all equivalent of ail ingredient in such a combination. Questions of the kind usually
arise in comparing the machine of the defendant in a suit
for infringement with that of the plaintiff, and the rule is
that if the defendant omits entirely one of the ingredients
of the plaintiff's combination, without substituting any
other, he does not infringe, and if he substitutes another in
the place of the one omitted, which is new or which performs a substantially different function, or even if it is old
but was not known at the date of the plaintiff's patent as a
proper substitute for the omitted ingredient, he does not infringe.* By an equivalent in such a case it is meant that
the ingredient substituted for the one withdrawn performs
the same function as the other, and that it was well known
at the date of the patent securing the invention as a proper
substitute for the one omitted in the patented combination.t
Hence it follcvs that a party who merely substitutes another
old ingredient for one of the ingredients of a patented com* Carver v. Hyde, 16 Peters, 514; Brooks v. Fiske, 15 Howard, 212; Stimpson v. Railroad, 10 Id. 329; Prouty v. Ruggles, 16 Peters, 341.

bination is an infringer if the substitute performs the same
function as the ingredient for which it was substituted, and
was well known at the date of the patent as a proper substitute for the omitted ingredient; but the rule is otherwise
if the ingredient substituted was a new one or performed
substantially a different function, or was not known at the
date of the plaintiff's patent as a proper substitute for the
one omitted, as in that event he does not infringe.*
Inconveniences past estimation would result if those rules
should be applied in defining the rights of a patentee to
make amendments to the specification of an original patent
when applying for a reissue, as it would open the door in
every case to issues of fact whether the substituted device
is or is not an equivalent for the one withdrawn, within
the rules defining what is meant by that term, which issues
of fact might be determined one way in one case and another and a different way in another case. NTor can those
rules be applied in such a case consistently with the language of the section allowing a surrender and reissue, which
is limited to the correction of errors which have arisen by
inadvertence, accident, or mistake, nor without an utter disregard either of the condition that the reissue shall be for
the same invention as the original, or of the clause of the
twenty-sixth section, which provides that before any inventor
shall receive a patent for his invention he shall file in the
Patent Office a written description of the same in such full,
clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any one skilled
in the art to make, construct, and use the same.
Substitution of one ingredient for another may perhaps
be made in cases where it would be competent for the court
to decide, as matter of law, that the ingredient substituted
is an equivalent for the one withdrawn, as where a spring
is substituted for a lever to produce power, or where a
weight is substituted for a spring to produce pressure, but

the court could seldom or never, in a suit at law, undertake
to determine without a jury whether a particular ingredient

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

substituted in a reissued patent was or was not known at
the date of the original patent as a proper substitute for the
one withdrawn from the combination described in the original specification.
Viewed in the light of these several suggestions the court
is of the opinion that it is not competent for a patentee,
when he surrenders an original patent, to amend the specification for the new patent by striking out from the original
the correct description of one of the ingredients of the patented combination, and to substitute in its place the description of other devices not well known at the date of the
original patent as a proper substitute for the ingredient
whose description is stricken out.
2. Just the same considerations are involved in the second
proposition, which, therefore, requires no further discussion,
as it is fully maintained by the reasons given in support of
the first proposition.
3. Even grant that neither of the rules laid down in the
two preceding propositions are correct, still the court is unhesitatingly of the opinion that the judgment in this case
must be reversed for the reason that the instructions given
to the jury are erroneous, inasmuch as they do not correctly
define the meaning of an equivalent as applied to the ingredients of an invention consisting entirely of a combination
of ingredients all of which are old.
Assume the theory that the patentee of such a patent, in
efiecting a reissue, may strike out from the original specification the description of one of the ingredients of the patented combination and insert as a substitute therefor in the
new specification the description of an equivalent for the
same, '&hich is denied, still it is clear law that the substituted ingredient cannot be regarded as a legal equivalent,
within the meaning of the Patent law, unless it performs
substantially the same function as the ingredient withdrawn,
and was well known as such an ingredient at the date of the
original patent and as a proper substitute for the ingredient
which was included in the patented combination.
Questions of the kind usually arise where it becomes nec-

essary to determine whether the defendant is guilty of an
infringement in case it appears that he has not used all of
the ingredients of the patented combination of the plaintiE:
Repeated decisions of this court have settled the rule in
such cases that if the ingredient substituted by the defendant for the one left out in the defendant's machine was a
newly discovered one, or even an old one performing some
new function, and was not known at the date of the plaintiff's patent as a proper substitute for the ingredient left
out, the charge of infringement cannot be maintained.*
Tested by these considerations the court here is of the
opinion that the judgment of the Circuit Court must be reversed for three reasons, as follows: (1.) That the prayer
for instruction presented by the defendant, that the reissued
patent is not for the same invention as the original, was improperly refused. (2.) That the Circuit Court improperly
refused to instruct the jury that the defendant did not infringe the plaintiff's patent unless the apparatus had the
feeding device of the original patent in combination with
the rotating brush or picker and the pervious cone and the
chamber or tunnel described in the original specification.
(3.) That the Circuit Court erred in instructing the jury that
the reissued patent is valid as respects the fourth claim if
the combination of the three ingredients therein mentioned
is new and could be usefully employed for the purpose of
facilitating the making of hat-bodies, supplemented by any
known means of guiding the fur in such a way as to bring
the same, by the operation of these three devices, to the
cone so as to make a hat-body, or if those three devices
would make a hat-body without the aid of other means of
protecting the fur against escape.
Two errors are contained in that instruction, as follows:
(1.) It gives an erroneous definition of an equivalent for the
ingredient of a combination consisting wholly of such as
are old, as the substituted ingredient in such a case must be

one which was known at the date of the original patent as

1. Every admission upon which a party relies, is to be taken as an entirety
of the fact which makes for his side, with the qualifications which limit,
modify, or destroy its effect. When, therefore, the agent and officers
of an insurance company stated to the agent of a party claiming upon a
policy of insurance that the preliminary proofs presented were sufficient
as to the death of the insured, but that they showed that the insured had
committed suicide, the whole admission must be taken together. If
sufficient to establish the fact of the death of the insured, it was also
sufficient to show the manner of his death.
2. The preliminary proofs presented to an insurance company, in compliance
with the condition of its policy of insurance, are admissible as primo

behalf of the company.
