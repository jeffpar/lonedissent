THE STEAMER WEBB.
1, Although an engagement by a steamer to tow a sailing vessel does not
impose more than an obligation to carry out the contract with that degree of caution which prudent navigators usually employ in similar
services, yet there may be cases in which the result is a safe criterion
by which to judge of the act which has caused it, And when a steamer
undertaking to tow a ship and having i. well-known and straight course
to pursue, suffered the ship, after towing her for but an hour or an hour
and a half, to run aground at the end of a course of nine miles, on a
shoal between three and four miles from the proper line of the voyage,
the court held the steamer liable, especially as there was very considerable evidence that her compasses were untrue. And this decisio-a was
not affected by the fact that the voyage lay through waters where the
currents were variable in the direction of their flow (the direction and
force, however, being well known), and though for a part of the njne
miles there was a thick fog.
2. The court refused to reverse a decree which on the merits they approved
because a deposition which ought not to have been read was read before
a commissioner to whom the case was referred to compute damages:
there being other evidence that the damages were as great as this court
finally awarded.
8. Decree in admiralty in the District and Circuit Courts for a greater
amount than the sum for which sureties were bound, on stipulations for
a discharge of the vessel from the marshal's custody, reformed by this
court so as not to exceed that sum.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court for the District of Southern
New York; the case, as assumed by the court on a considerable body of evidence, which it examined and recapitulated, having been essentially thus:
In March, 1859, the steamer Webb, a steamer of good
character, belonging to the port of New York and engaged
in towing ships at sea, was in B6ston, having just then,
under charge of a coast pilot named Sherwood, towed a ship
to that port. This pilot Sherwood had had twelve years'
experience as a coast pilot and was recommended by insurance companies. The owners of the Webb had engaged
nim to take the steamer back to New York, and they had
agreed also with the owners of another ship, then lying at
New Bedford, to stop for her oif the way and tow her to

New York, and that this towage should be under direction
of the same pilot.
In these circumstances one Hazard, master of the ship
Shooting Star, lying at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, applied
to the owners of the Webb to tow her to New York. The
owners agreed in writing accordingly " to tow the ship and
furnish coast pilot for $625." Having gone to Portsmouth and
taken her tow, the Webb, under the pilotage of Sherwood,
set off with a good complement of men on her voyage for
New York. The course of the voyage lay south, past and
round Cape'Cod, through the waters that lie between the
island of Nantucket on the south side and Barnstable
County, Massachusetts, on the north, into what is known as
the Vineyard Sound; and so through Long Island Sound
to New York. The approaches to the Vineyard Sound
(which for the purpose of this case may be considered as beginning with " Handkerchief Shoal" on the east of it, and
as you leave the main ocean to enter the passages made by
islands and the main land of Massachusetts) abound with
shoals and with currents, which last, though close to each
other, run in opposite directions. But the currents follow
each its own direction, and, like the shoals, are marked with
precision upon the charts.
About a hundred yards south of Handkerchief Light-a
light upon the shoal-the Webb and her tow found themselves at about 2 or 21 o'clock A.M.-nearer the latter tiine,
perhaps, than the former-on the morning of March 23d.
This was the exact position where they ought to have been
in order to reach 'New York; and their route to that port was
by a single straight course west, three-quarters south, to a
light called Cross Rip Light, eleven nautical miles (rather less
than thirteen statute or land miles) distant from the Hand.
kerchief. This Cross Rip Light is on a boat where there is
a fog-bell,,audible in fogs,.three miles off The rate of the
vessels as they passed the Handkerchief was about twelve
knots an hour. The tide, at this time, had just turned ebb,
the effect of which was to make the current for about halfway from Handkerchief to Cross Rip run north, and for the

rest of the distance to run southwest. There was a light wind
from the southeast; it was raining, but not so that they could
not see the coast-lights which they had passed, and even that
on the northeast point of Nantucket, more, than five miles
off. Soon after passing the Handkerchief Light the wind
died out, the weather became misty, and in half an hour,
and by the time that they got half-way from the Handkerchief to Cross Rip it was so thick that they could not see
even the lights of the ship astern; though up to this point
the fog bad not been thus thick. Lookouts were properly
posted. When the fog rose they were on the course mentioned, going, as already stated, twelve knots. The pilot decided to keep up this speed for thirty minutes, expecting at
the end of that time to be within hearing of the bell from
Cross Rip. Captain Hazard objected to going on through this
fog and desired to anchor, but on the pilot's statement that a
vessel which once anchored where they were had been
obliged to cut some spars to avoid ruhning aground, and or
an assurance that there was no danger in running to Cross
Rip, he yielded and consented to keep on. The pilot gave
the course west half south, but the steamer was headed by
her compass west-southwest, in order to allow for a variation
from local attraction caused by iron on board the vessel,
which Captain Hazard supposed to be one and a half points
south of their true course when running west, diminishing
to zero, when running south. They ran on this course at
full speed for thirty-two minutes, and then, not hearing the
bell, shut off steam, reducing their rate to between two and
three knots, and having the load cast by another pilot named
Wilsoft, the captain of a Boston packet, who as a friend of
Sherwood's had been allowed a free passage to New York.
After running slow for forty-five minutes they found themselves in shallow water, which Sherwood took for a shoal
called Horseshoe Shoal, that lies about a mile north of Cross
Rip. To avoid this he turned his steamer towards the south,
and immediately the ship was aground. She had run on
Tuekernuck Shoal, a point about four miles southeasterly
from both the Horseshoe and Cross Rip, about nine miles

southwest by west half west from the Handkerchief Light,
and fully three and a third miles to the south of the course in
which the vessels ought to have been. This was at half-past three,
or a very little later, in the morning. After some vain endeavors to drag her off, the steamer left the ship and cast
anchor in the neighborhood.
After daylight the steamer tried to approach the ship, to
give her the end of the towing hawser, the ship having
drifted off the shoal and then riding at anchor. The crew
began to heave on the anchor. As was alleged by the
people on the steamer, they on the ship hove short, and the
vessel picked up her anchor and drifted away. But the ship
had, in fact, lost her an.chor. She soon went ashore again,
her stern resting on the sand. The wind getting very strong
and the sea violent, under a gale which had suddenly sprung
up, the ship, in order to prevent her bow being thrown upon
a ridge, which, if she struck, her captain thought might dash
her to pieces, after losing the port anchor cast out the starboard one. The ship swung directly upon the flukes of this
anchor and knocked holes in her bottom through which she
filled with water. Before this she had not leaked. The
gale was so high and the sea so rough and boisterous that
communications between the vessels could not be made.
The steamer then went to Edgartown, a town on the island
of Martha's Vineyard, for a steam-pump and wreckers. In
the meantime, and before the Webb got back, one Levi
Hotchkiss-a part owner of the vessel, who happened to be
aboard-got on.to a sloop and, acting with energy, procured
relief from Boston and Nantucket. Thus aided, the ship got
off, and her leaks having been temporarily stopped, she was
got into New York and sent into dock for repairs.
After the accident, the Webb's compass was carefully examined and tested; and considerable testimony tended to
prove 'that the variation from local attraction (the iron on
the vessel) on the west courpe was one and a half points to
the north, instead of to the south, as had been supposed by
the captain and pilot.
Hereupon the owners of the ship, by proceeding in ren,

libelled the Web6 for $17,500 damages,. and the marshal
seized her. She was, however, discharged from his custody
on her owners entering into bonds for $18,000 as the value
of the ship, and $250, the sum estimated as possible amount
of costs, conditioned to pay what might be awarded by final
decree.
To establish the case of the ship the testimony of Hotchkiss, already mentioned, one of her part owners, had been
taken, June 20th, 1859, "saving the exception as to the
competency of the witness ;" the statute of July 16th, 1862,
which allows parties and interested witnesses to testify not
having then passed. Damages suffered by the ship, and much
exceeding $18,000, were proved by the bills of repairs produced and by other witnesses than Hotchkiss. The deposition of Hotchkiss was not read in the District Court; without hearing which that court decreed against the steamdr,
and referred the case to a commissioner to ascertain damages.
The commissioner, however, did hear the deposition, and
awarded $20,378 damages; this being followed by a final
decree in the District Court for $24,590. On appeal to the
Circuit Court, that court not reading the deposition, affirmed
the decree, -and gave a final decree there for $q8,292. From
that decree the case was brought here by the owners of the
steamer, the record which came here including Hotchkiss's
deposition.
Mr. .

C. Benedict, for the appellants:

The owners of the stearmboat were not common carriers
nor insurers. All they contracted for was a propelli ng power
to tow the ship with reasonable skill and care. They did
not guarantee successful towing, free from all accident and
injury. Like the professi-onal man, they are responsible
only for actual negligence, for the lack of such care as a
careful man would give to his own property.* And this
negligence must be proved by the libellant. The presump• The Julia, 1 Lushington, 231; Wells v. The Steam Na 7igation Cornpany, 2 Comstock, 208-9.

tion is against the negligence, and the burden is on him to
prove it affirmatively, not only that there was negligence,
but culpable negligence that caused the damage.*
Now here the steamer and the care and precaution eu
board of her were of the best kind. The pilot, 'Captain
Sherwood, was a competent pilot, of large experience and
well recommended; and he had the aid of Wilson, a skilful
friend. The lead was heaved, shoals were watched, and
there was a good lookout.
The damage was caused by the perils of the sea-the inevitable accidents of the navigation-the act of God; the
rain, the fog, the darkness, the variable, conflicting, and imperceptible currents and the winds. The waters through
which this navigation lay are very peculiar waters. Islands
and shoals, and swashes, and channels abound. The currents do not flow regularly, six hours one way and six hours
another.

At diffbrent parta of the tide it will run in the

same place two hours in one direction, and in the next two
hours in the opposite direction in the same ebb or flow; and
in some places, when the tide will be running west, the same
tide, at a little distance off, will be running southwest, or
south. These uncertain and contradictory currents an d
tides, make the navigation dangerous in the night in fair
weather, even when the many lights in light-houses and
light-ships are visible. Of course they make it doubly so
when nothing is visible in consequence of dense fog. And
when such a fog shuts suddenly down, there is no retreating
nor evading or escaping, except by slow and careful going
on, with abundant lookout and a' constant casting of the lead.
All that we gave. We slackened speed; we heaved the
lead; we kept a sharp lookout, with in fact two pilots.
Shutting off the steam was a plain duty, and yet doing
this caused the vessel to run more slowly, and allowed the
currents to have more effect on it. The ship would thus be
under the influence of two equal forces operating nearly at
right angles; steam, driving her to the westward and the

current bearing her to the southward. The combination of
those two forces would force her between the two on a diagonal line directly upon Tuckernuck Shoal on which she
struck.
There is no sufficient evidence to discredit the compasses.
They were in good condition. Their variation, caused by
the iron on board, as is the case in all steamers, was regular
and well known. On an east or west course it was a point
and a half; that is to say, to make a west course you would
have to steer west by south half south, and on an east course,
the same rule. This variation was properly allowed for in
all courses.
But after all, the injury to the ship was caused by her own
mismanagement after she struck the shoal and cast her port
anchor. She got off the shoal where she first grounded
without any injury, and if after that she had been guilty of
no negligence there would have been no damage. Instead
of remaining quietly at her anchor where the steamer might
take hold of her, and take her out with a long chain, on her
voyage, they hove the anchor short, and the ship then picked
up her anchor and went ashore-broke adrift, and drove
astbru on to the shoals. This heaving short was a great
negligence, and was the first and material cause of damage.
She then lay with her stern on the sand, her bow swinging
and straining on her short chain, which parted; and if left
to herself she would have gone over the shoal into deep
water. It was a great negligence which let go the starboard
anchor on the starboard side of the ship when she was
swinging to starboard, her stern lying aground. As a natural consequence she swung aon the anchor and stove holes in
her bottom, the second and the principal cause of the d'amage. If no anchor had been thrown out, the ship would
have gone through the shoal into deep water and floated
without any damage except scraping the copper.
Neither was the steamer in fault. Her duty to the ship
was to tow her to, New York, to act as her propelling power,
to use all reasonable care and diligence to do so, and if she
got in difficulty to endeavor to extricate, her. It had this

extent; no more. The captain of the steamer was not under
the least obligation to throw his boat alongside of that ship
in the midst of breakers and uneven and rolling shoals in a
tempestuous gale. It could not possibly do the ship any
good, and might destroy them both. It was his duty not to
do it, and it was his duty to go to the nearest port and procure surf-boats and wreckers to aid her, which was just what
he did. During the time that the ship was ashore, the
steamer tried to get to her, making repeated efforts, backing in towards her,.but was unable to get to her. The noise
made by the gale prevented hailing, and the ship could not
fail to know When the steamer turned toward Edgartown
that it was going for assistance, without which nothing useful could be done.
Under the contract "to furnish a coast pilot," the pilot
was the servant of the ship and not of the steamer. The
mate of the tug was not responsible for the conduct of the
-pilot. His only contract as to the pilot, was to get a pilot
for the owner of the ship, and to get one of good repute for
skill and diligence. Hazard was the agent of the owner of
the ship, who accepted and approved his choice of a pilot.
The commissioner also allowed the deposition of Captain
Hotchkiss, which was incompetent, to be read in evidence
before him on the question of damages. The deposition,
not being competent when taken, did not become competent
by lapse of time, or by any subsequent statute. This improperly affected the final decree, which on account of the
result which the error caused ought to be reversed.
The libellants at best are entitled to a deciee for but
$18,250. The sureties are only bound to the extent of the
obligation expressed in their bond.*

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

the alleged careless and unskilful towage, and the first question is whether the towage was either unskilful or negligent.
It must be conceded that an engagement to tow does not
impose either an obligation to insure, or the, liability of
common carriers. The burden is always upon him who
alleges the breach of such a contract to show either that
there has been no attempt at performance, or that there has
been negligence, or unskilfulness to his injury in the performance. Unlike the case of common carriers, damage
sustained by the tow does not ordinarily raise a presumption
that the tug has been in fault. The contract requires no
more than that he who undertakes to tow shall carry out
his undertaking with that degree of caution and skill which
prudent navigators usually employ in similar services. But
there may be cases in which the result is a safe criterion by
which to judge of the character or the act which has caused
it. Had the ship in this case been' towed upon a shoal ten
miles north or ten miles east of Handkerchief Shoal, after
leaving that shoal for Cross Rip, it cannot be doubted that
the fi ct of the' stranding at such a place, would; in the absence of explanation, be almost conclusive evidence of unskilfulness,. or carelessness in the navigation of the tug.
The place where the injury occurred would be considered
in connection with the injury itself, and together, they would
very satisfactorily show a breach of the contract, if no excuse were given. At least they would be sufficient to cast
upon the claimants of the tug the burden of establishing
some excuse for the deviation from the usual and proper
course.
In the present case the departure from the true course
was not so great, but it was enough to devolve upon the tug
the duty of explanation. The ship was, as we have noticed,
towed upon a shoal more than three miles south of the
proper course to Cross Rip Light. Had the course been a
long one the deviation would not have been so remarkable.
But as the entire distance from Handkerchief Shoal to Cross
Rip is less than thirteen statute miles, and as the ship was
stranded when only about three-quarters of this distance was

Opinion of the court.

passed, it is apparent there must have been either bad management of the tug, or some unusual cause must have operated to produce the disaster, a cause against which ordinary
prudence was not bound to guard. Certainly this isenough
to impose upon the tug the necessity of explaining how she
came to be so far off her cou'rse in running so short a distace. We do not say that in orddr to excuse her it must
be shown the accident was inevitable, but it ought to appear
that so remarkable a deviation from her correct course,
made so soon after leaving Handkerchief Light, was consistent with cautious and skilful management.
The weight of the evidence is that the ship was run upon
the shoal in a little more than an hour, manifestly not more
than an hour and a half, after she passed Handkerchief
Light. -All the witnesses agree that it was between three
and four o'clock ,vhen she took ground. It follows that the
entire departure from the true course was made within this
period of an hour, or at most, an hour and a half.
The excuses set up in behalf of the steamer are that the
!night was foggy and dark, and that the currents were variable, conflicting, and imperceptible. There is no evidence
that there was any wind which could have caused embarrassment until some time after the ship had stranded. It
blew lightly from the south and east, and its tendency, therefore, was to keep the steamer up to the northward of her
true course. It was raining, but there was no fog until
after Handkerchief Light had been passed. Soon afterwards the weather began to grow misty and thick, but the
clear preponderance of,,the testimony is that it was not until
they had passed over about half the distance to Cross Rip
that the fog became so dense that the lights could not be
seen. I"this is ,sothere was no difficulty in determining the
position of the steamer. It is not perceived, however, that
this is very material. The tog, whether dense or thin, was
itself no embarrassment to the steamer's taking and keeping
the right course, a course marked on the chart, and well
known by the pilot and by the captain.
Though the currents were variable in the direction of

THE STEAMER WEBB.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

their flow, yet both their direction and their force were well
known. All that was needed was to give them careful attention, and to make allowances for their operation. So
much prudent navigation requiied. There is no evidence
that they were of unusual strength on the night of the disaster, or that they ran in an unusual direction, and there
was nothing in the state of the weather to cause a difference
from what was common. Ordinary skill was quite sufficient
to enable the pilot of the tug to counteract their force, and
to keep both the tug and the tow on the proper course. It
was during the first third of the tide that the passage was
made over the first third of the course from Handkerchief
Light to Cross Rip, as stated by the pilot. During this
time the current or tide was setting northwest, bearing the
steamer northward, and on the last half of the course, on
which she entered before the steam was shut oi; the ebb-tide
was setting southwest. Such is the evidence, as also that,
after the steam was shut ofl; the motion of the steamer
through the water was at the rate of two or three knots an
hour, and that she was thus moving about forty-five minutes
before the ship struck. If this is so, she was constantly
making westing during that three-quarters of an hour, if
headed right; and, if she was in the right position when
the steam was shut off, the calculation is easy that shows a
southwest current couid not have carried her on to Tuckernuck Shoal. It is plain, therefore, the stranding of th4
ship was not the fault of the currents. They do not account
for it, even if nothing was done to counteract their known
tendency.
There is nothing else in the case that tends to show that
the disaster was not due to the negligence of the tug. On
the contrary, there is very considerable evidence that her
compasses were untrue, and so deranged as on a westerly
course to head her too much to the south. This, of itself,
would account for the- deviation, and this of course would be
the steamer's fault.
It has been sfivenuously arguedthat the great injury to
tfie ship was caused by her own nismanagement after she

had struck the shoal and cast her port anchor. After daylight, when the steamer was about to back down in order
to attach herself again to the ship, which had then got off
the shoal and was riding at anchor, the ship's crew commenced heaving on the anchor; and it is alleged they hove
short, so that the anchor was picked up, and, a gale coming
on to blow suddenly, she went again upon the shoal. The
anchor, however, instead of being picked up, was lost, and
it was proper to heave upon it in order to bring the ship
nearer the stern of the steamer, and thus aid in the effort to
renew attachment to the steamer. We do not discover in
this any negligence on the part of the ship. What was done
was rendered prudent, if not necessary, by the prior misconduct of the tug. Nor was casting the starboard anchor, after
the ship broke adrift, negligence under the circumstances,
though it proved unfortunate, and though the ship afterwards swung upon it and bilged. The port anchor had been
lost, and the wi'nd was then blowing a gale. Probably the
bilging was what saved the ship from total destruction;
and, if casting the starboard anchor was an act of mistaken
judgment, it cannot excuse the tug, which negligently
brought the ship into the peril from which she sought thus
to escape.
The attempt to escape responsibility under the allegation
that the wrong, if any, was that of the pilot, and that' the
pilot was the employee of the ship and not of the steamer,
wholly fails. Neither the written contract for towage nor
the antecedent negotiation establishes any such thing. Under the engagements of the steamer, assumed before the
contract of towage was made, it was impossible to have any
other pilot than Sherwood, who was the pilot of the steamer,
and there is nothing to show that the ship undertook to run
the risk of pilotage.
It is finally objected that the deposition of Levi Hlotchkiss
was allowed to be read, though lie was incompetent when it
was taken. It does not appear to have been used in either
the ]District or the Circuit Court, though it was read before
the commissioner appointed to ascertain the damages. ObVOL. XIV.

jeetion was made to it there, and it must be conceded the
deposition should not have been received, but its reception
can hardly justify us in sending the case back for a new trial.
When the commissioner received it, if it was intended to
insist upon the objection, application should have been made
to the court for an order to exclude it. This was not done.
Conceding, however, that the error was not thus cured,
still the evidence before the commissioner related only to
the amount of damages, and without the testimony of"Hotchkiss, the damages were plainly more than the libellants are
entitled to recover in this proceeding. The libel was'in rem,
against the steamer, and the decree cannot be for more than
is within the jurisdiction of the court. The steamer was
discharged from arrest, on stipulation in the sum of eighteen
thousand dollars for value, and two hundred and fifty dollars
for costA. The stipulators, to the extent of their stipulation,
have been substituted for the steamer, and thus nothing but
the eighteen thousand dollars value and two hundred and
fifty dollars for costs is within the control of the court. To
that extent and no greater the stipulators have subjected
themselves to the judgment of the court, and they cannot be
made liable as stipulators beyond it. This was determined
in the case of The Ann Caroline,* and we need not repeat
what was then said. The decree in this ease was largely in
excess of the stipulation, and while it is affirmed upon its
merits, it must be modified in regard to the amount of damages recoverable from the stipulators.
The decree of the Circuit Court is AFFIRMED, WITH THE
MODIFICATION that it be reduced to the sum of eighteen thou-

sand dollars damages and two hundred and fifty dollars
costs; and it is further ordered that each party pay his own
costs in this court.
