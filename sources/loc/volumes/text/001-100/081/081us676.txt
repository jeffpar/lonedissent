Statement of the case.

entire value, could the plaintiffs have recovered the whole
$40,000, and have retained it, together with the $39,850 paid
or due for freight? Would not the policy have enured to
the benefit of the United States to the extent of the payments made? To hold that it would not would be giving
to the contract a most unreasonable construction. And it
not, how can the plaintiffs now be entitled to the whole value
of the vessel, in addition to all they have received for her
hire, as if no part of her price had been paid, or as if the
United States had no interest ? We think they are not thus
entitled. In our opinion the government had an equitable
interest in the vessel at the time she was lost, and as the interest of the plaintiffh amounted to no more than $40,000,
which sum they have already received, they have no further
just claim.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

WILLARD V. PRESBURY.
1. Congress has power to confer on the city of Washington authority to
assess upon the adjacent proprietors of lots, the expense of repairing
streets with a new and different pavement, or of repairing an old pavement. The tax need not be a general one on the city.
2. A bill charging fraudulent misrepresentations in procuring the passage of
an ordinance to pave a street, with the intent to cast on lessees of certain property on the street the burden (the lessees, by their leases, being
bound to pay all taxes), and so to benefit the lessor's reversionary interest, dismissed on proofs held insufficient.
APPEAL from a decree of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia; the case being this:

An act of Congress, passed February 23d, 1865, provides:
"That the corporation of the city of Washington shall have
full power and authority to levy taxes on particular wards,
parts, or sections of the city for their particular local improvements, and to cause the curbstones to be set, the foot and
carriage-ways (or so much thereof as they may deem best) to
be graded and paved."

Dec. 1871.]

WILLARD V. PRESBURY.
Statement of the case.

Another clause in the same act provides:
"That the corporation, &c., is hereby authorized to lay and
collect a tax upon all property bordering upon each street or
alley that may be paved, sewered, lighted, cleaned, or watered
by said corporation, in aceordance with the provisions of this
ac t."

Ou the 12th October, 1865, the city authorities of Washington passed an ordinance which provided for the grading
and paving a certain part of Fourteenth Street (including a
part which passes on the east side of the hotel known as
Willard's, at the northwest corner of Pennsylvania Avenue
and Fourteenth Street), with a particular kind of pavement
referred to; to replace or reset the eurhstones, repair or
renew the sidewalks or foot-pavements, &e. And to defray
the expenses incurred, the oi'dinance directed a special tax
to be levied under the authority of the above quoted act of
Congress of the 23d February, 1865, on all lots and parts o4
lots along the said Fourteenth Street, the said taxes to be
assessed and collected in the same manner as provided by
an act of May 23d, 1853.
The street, including that part running along the east side
of Willard's Hotel, having been repaved under the ordinance,
the city assessed $1835 on the hotel property, of which at
this time, Presbury, Sykes & Chadwick were lessees, from
the owners, J. C. and H. A. Willard, under a lease which
contained a covenant that the lessees should pay all taxes
imposed by Congress or the city authorities on the property.
Hereupon, Presbury, Sykes & Chadwick filed their bill in
the court below against J. C. Willard, setting forth their
lease and the covenant just mentioned, that the portion of
Fourteenth Street in front of the premises had been graded
and paved, and that the pavement was in good condition
and repair ; that, notwithstanding this, the common council
of the city passed the ordinance already mentioned, directing that Fourteenth Street, including the portion referred
to, should be regraded and repaved, although as to this portion it was wholly unnecessary, and had not been called fbr

by the adjacent proprietors of lots; that the ordinance, as
originally drafted, omitted this portion, and would have thus
been adopted had it not been for the misrepresentations of
the defendant, J. C. Willard, and a contract made by him
with the mayor and common council in respect to the payrneiit of the expenses; that the defendant, the said Willard,
persuaded the authorities to include the portion of the street
mentioned, by representing that he and his brothers were
the exclusive owners of all the property contiguous to it;
that they all desired the work to be done; and that he and
they would be required to pay all the assessments, he (the
bill alleged), the said Willard, well knowing that the saidrepresentations were untrue, and that the said work was not
necessary, and was not desired by the adjacent owners; and
also, well knowing that, by the covenant in their lease, the
complainants, lessees of the hotel, would be required to pay
the assessments. The hill further charged that J. C. Willard agreed with the mayor and common council that if they
would pass the ordinance requiring the work to be done he
would pay the full amount of the expense assessed; that the
grading and paving had since been completed, and the assessments made upon the adjacent owners, and the sum of
$1835 had been charged upon the property included in the
lease, which the said defendant refused to pay, and payment
of which he caused to be demanded of them, the complainants. The bill prayed that the common council be enjoined
from collecting the assessment, or that it be set aside for
irregularity, or, if not, that the defendant, the said Willard,
be decreed to pay it.
There were four witnesses examined in the case. Mr.
Wallach, who was the mayor at the time the ordinance was
passed and the work done, was one. iHe stated in substance
that Willard had an interview with him while the ordinance
was pending in the city councils, and expressed great anxiety
for its passage; that he made no representation to him while
the bill was pending; that after the ordinance was passed,
ani while the work was in progress, it was not the intention
of the witness to regrade and pave the portion of the street

to which Willard's hotel was adjacent;* that that portion
had been paved within a few years with cobble-stones; that
the defendant urged him to pave it with the new material;
and, as an inducement, said that he had the entire portion
of one side to pay for; and that he and his brother owned
a larger portion of the property fronting on it than any
one person. On the witness suggesting that there might
be objections on the part of Mrs. Farnum and Mrs. Burke,
the owners of the remaining portion, he said that if they
objected he would be responsible for their assessments. The
witness stated that he thinks that he would not have had the
paving done at that time had it not been for the representations and urgent request of the defendant; that he, the
mayor, had full power in the matters given him in the ordinance. The witness also stated there was no agreement
between him and the said defcidant, that he was to be personally responsible for the assessments or cost of the pavement. Willard gave him to understand that he would have
to bear the expense of the pavement in front of his property.
Mr. Owen, an alderman at the time, also a witness, stated
that he drew the original ordinance for paving the streets,
and omitted the portion of the street to which Willard's
Hotel was adjacent; that defendant presented an ordinance
which included this portion, and that the witness amended
his so as to include it. He had omitted this portion as it
was well enough paved with cobhle-stones.
le had a conversation with defendant while the ordinance was pending
lie seemed vexed at the delay, and said that he and, his
brothers would have to pay for most of the work, and that
the other property-owners were fully able to pay their proportion, except as to the Burcb property, and, if that was
any objection, he would have to pay it himself. The witness stated that he knew of no inducements held out by
Willard to procure the passage of the ordinance, encept
what he had stated.
Mr. Chadwick, one of the complainants, was also called as

a witness. lie stated that before taking the lease he took a
full survey of the property and its surroundings; that the
pavement of Fourteenth Street in front was in good condition, an(d when taken up was the best in the city. le received a notice from J. C. & 14. A. Willard, the landlords,
to take up the pavement of the street and put a new one
down, at which he was greatly surprised; and that shortly
after, workmen proceeded to take up the old pavement;
that lie had no knowledge of the ordinance till the work
was begun; that the street at the time needed no repair.
Mr. Ball, called as a witness, simply stated, in answer to
a question, that the street, at the time the old pavement was
taken up, was in the best condition.
The court, upon th is evidence, decreed that the defendant,
Willard, should be liable personally to pay the assessments
levied upon the premises leased to the complainants, directing that, if not paid in ten days, the city authorities should
proceed and sell his reversionary interest therein to pay the
same. From this decree Willard appealed.
Messrs. W. D. Davidqe and W. F. Mallin y, for the appellani; Messrs. R. 7' Merrick and R. J. Brent, cenlra.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
Some question has been made by the counsel for the ap.
pellees as to the power of Congress to confer upon the city
authority to assess upon the adjacent proprietors of lots the
expense of repairing streets with a new and different pavement or repairing ai old one. It is asserted that this should
be a general tax on the city. But the power, we think, cannot well be denied. The Constitution confers upon Congress
the authority to exercise exclusive legislation over this Distriet.*
The bill seeks to compel Willard to pay the tax levied on
the hotel (of which the appellees are lessees, and bound by
their covenant to pay the same), upon the ground,

WILLARD V.

Opinion of the court.

1st. That lie procured the passage of the city ordinance
to make the; improvenfent in the street by fraudulent misrepresentations to the mayor and common council, with the
intent to cast upon the lessees the burden of the tax, and to
benefit his own reversionary interest in the premises; and
2d. That he had agreed with the mayor and common
council, if they would pass the ordinance requiring the improvements to be made, he would pay the full amount of
any assessments or tax for and on account of the expense of
the same.
On looking into the proofs in the record it will be seen
that this second ground for charging Willard, the appellant,
with the expense of the improvements is wholly unsustainied.
No such agreement was made as alleged in the bill.
And as it respects the first ground, the only evidence in
support of it is that, pending the ordinance before the city
council, in a conversation with Alderman Owen, lie said that
he and his brothers would have to pay for most of the work,
and that the other property owners along there were fully
able to pay their proportions, except as to the Burch property, and it' there was any objection as to that he would pay
for it himself--that portion of it. The witness said that he
knew of no inducements held out by Willard to procure the
passage of the ordinance, except as stated above.
Without stopping to inquire whether a misrepresentation
simply to one of the aldermen constituting the board, to induce him to pass an ordinance for the improvement of a
street, could be regarded as making out a case of misrepresentation that would subject the guilty party to any responsibility for its passage, or whether, if such responsibility was
established, the appropriate remedy would, not be an action
at law, it is sufficient to say, in the present case, that there
is no evidence in the record showing that the representations
made were untrue, and hence the.first ground for subjecting
the appellant also fails.
We say nothing as to the representations made to the
mayor after the passage of the ordinance and while the work
was in progress, or how far these might subject the appellant

to liability, as that evidence is not pertinent to the issue
made in the bill before us.
