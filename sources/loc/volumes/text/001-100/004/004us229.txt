The defendant's counsel (Dallas) contended; -that whatever
might be the impressions, or inferences, of the referees, the declaration of MILure did not, in itself, amount to an express assumpsit,
that it was not a case, inwhich an implied assumpsit could be rais.ed; that, at most, it was a mere gratuitous undertaking without any
possible consideration; beneficial to Alt ure; a nudum pactum, on
which no action could be maintained;. and that ihe consideration
was not proved by the evidence, as it was laid in the declaration.

sufficient to create a valid consideration for a promise; and

The President having honoured the defendant
an appointment, as attorney of the United States, for
the Eastern district of Pennsylvania; and the Governor having
been pleased, also, to appoint him Recorder of. the City of Philadelphia; it was thought, by some of the members of the Select
and Common Councils, that .the tenure of these offices, by the
same person, at the same time, was constitutionally incomptible.
And, in order to try the question, 1%1r. HopAinson2, the. solicitor
of the corporation, was instructed to move the Supreme Court,
for leave to file an information, (on the relation of the Select and
Common Councils) (2)in nature of a writ of quo warranto,to in,

corder. It was agreed, that the merits of the case should be discussed and decided upon this preliminary motion, in order to
avoid any public inconvenience; as the defendant declared his
determination not to act as Recorder, while a doubt rested upon
his right.
The case tumed, principally, on the construction of the 8th
section of the. 2d article, of the constitution of Pennsylvania;
which is expressed in these words: " No member of congress
" from this state, nor any person holding, or exercising,any offce
of trust or profit under the United States, shall, at the same
"time, hold or exercise ihe office of judge, secretary, treasurer,
prothonotary, register of wills, recorder of deeds, sheriff, or
"any office in this state, to which a salary is by law annexed, or
" any other office which future legislatures shall declare incom"patible with offices or appointments under the United State,."
The argument was conducted, with great and equal ability and
candour, by Messrs. Hophinson, B. Tilghman, and Lewis, in suppoq of the motion; and by Messrs. Ingersoll and .M' Kean,
against it.
In support of the motion, it was stated, as a foundation, that
the Recorder of the city of Philadelphiais a Yudge; and, consequently, within the clause of the constitution, which excludes an
officer- of the United States, from holding, or exercising, the office .of a judge, in this state. It was said, that the poliev of the
exclusion, originated in a jealousy, lest the federal government,
should overshadow.the state governments; and, if there was a
doubt upon the subject, that policy required a decision, affirming
the incompatibility of the offices in question. The commission, duties, and powers, of the Recorder were then analysed, with a
view, to prove that his office was of a judicial character; particularly when he acted as the organ of the mayor's couirt; and. that
it was not the name (as a recorder, a justice, &c.) but the duty,
which constituted a Yudge. ! State Laws, 658. s. 14. Ibid. 060.

In opposition to the motion, it was premised, that further than
the constitution has prescribed, a spirit of jealousy, between the
federal and state governments, ought not to be encouraged: and

the argument was pursued upon the following general propositions: 1801.
1st. That the 8th section of the 2d article of the constitution,
does not include in its prohibition, any other than the state oficers. 2dly. That the Recorder of the city of Philadelphiais not
an ofcer of the commonwealth, or state; but an officer of the corporation. 3dly. That the Recorder, according to the letter, the
spirit, and the meaning, of the constitution, is not a judge. The
following books were cited on these several propositions: Min.

The argument was, unavoidably, protracted till late in the last
day of the term; and the Judges, declaring that the question was
of too much importance to be decided without deliberation, directed a curia advisare vult till the next term; when the unanimous opinion of the Court, was delivered by
SHiPPEN, Chief Yustice: That although the Recorder of the
city of Philadelphiapossesses some powers, and performs some
duties, of a judicial nature, he is not-a judge, within the terms,
spirit, and meaning, of the 8th section of the 2d article of the
constitution.
The motion, for leave to file an information, in the nature of a
quo 'varranto, was, therefore, refused.
