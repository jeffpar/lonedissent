]HIS was a certiorari, to remove the proce dings from the

Amicable action.

"Blizabeth Mason.'
"t The defendant appeared before me by consent, and was
" charged on the oath of Barney Cart, and the affirmatidn of W.
" ohnston, clerks of the High-street market, in her presence,
" with being a person, who follows the business of a huckster,
" and selling provisions, &c. at second hand. And that the de" fendant did this day offer for sale, within the limits of the said
-mamket, butter, Veal, pork, fowls, eggs, and nuts, contrary to
ccan ordinance in that case made and provided. I, therefore, ad"judge, that the defendant pay a fine of 11. 17s. 6d. and costs
cc2s. 6d."
To this return a great variety of exceptions were filed; but
the argument and decision proceeded, principally, upon the fol*lowing:
1st. It is not stated, at what place the defendant followed the
business of a huckster.
2d. It is not stated, in what city High-street market is situ.

(1) An exception, that the words "of Philadelphh' had been omitted, in the

defendant had offended.
4th. It is not stated, that the defendant was convicted, though,
judgment is rendered against her.
The exceptions were supported by Al3Kean and Porter; who
cited, I Burn. 409. 142. Ordin. 29 March 1798, s. 16. Bosec. 12.

But, by the COURT: Some of the objections are inqurmount.
able. In the first place, it is not sufficient to state the evidence;
but the magistrate musf go on to declare, that the offence was
committed, and the defendant thereof convicted. Here, neither
the offence, nor the conviction, are to be found in the proceedings. In the next place, we have no statement where the defendant carried on the business of huckster; and it might be where
it was no offence to do so; or where the corporation had no jurisdiction to punish it as an offence. The proceedings are,.
therefore, manifestly erroneous, and must be set aside.

Black, Plaintiff in Error, versus Wistar.
JN error, from the Court of Common Pleas of Northumber.1 land county. The case was, briefly, this: William Wi star
brought an action of debt against 7ancs Black, in the Common
Pleas, to April term 1798. The writ demanded a debt of 7661.
9s. 5d. The declaration demanded a debt of 7661. 4s. 5d.on a
bill obligatory for that sum, dated the 28th of _May 1796, and
payable in three months with interest. On the l0th of September
1798, judgment was entered for 8691. 3s. 6d. with costs. A ft.
fa. issued to 7anuary term 1799, for 7661. 9s. 5d. which was
regularly returned, "Staid by order of plaintiff's attorney;" with
an additional indorsement, signed by Black, the defendant below, in these words: "I agree that the sheriff return a levy on
" this writ, as of the term to which it is returnable:" and such a
return was accordingly made, at a subsequent period. On the
18th of .uly 1800, the sheriff held an inquest, by virtue of the
above ft. fa. and returned the inquest annexed to the writ. The
inquest condemned the property; and it was afterwards sold on
a vend. exp. when Wistar became the purchaser.
