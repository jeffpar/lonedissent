Levy vcersus The Bank of the United States.

T

HIS was an action brought upon the following circumstan.
ces, which appeared in evidence upon the trial of the cause.
The plaintiff, Mr. Levy, kept his cash account with the bank
othe United States. On the 3d of August 1798, between 11 and
12 o'clock in the forenoon, his student presented for payment a
check on the bank, dated the 31st of Yuly 1798, purporting to be
drawn by Charles Wharton, in favour of foseph Thomas, (to
whom Mr. Levy had paid the money) or bearer, for 2,600 dollars: and the amount Was regularly and promptly entered to Mr.
Levy's credit, in his cash book, in the usual form, as of a deposit
of cash. At the examination of the checks, in the afternoon of
thesame day, the check in question was discovered to be a forgery; the entry was cancelled in the bank books; and one of the
clerks was sent to Mr. Levy, about 4 o'c'ock, to inform him of
it, to return the forged check, and to-demand his check in lieu of
it. This clerk, at first, told Mr. Levy, that the check was not
good, because Mr. WVharton had not the money in bank; to which
MAr Levy replied, "that is nothing to me." The clerk then told
him, that the check was forged; on which Mr. Levy, with gre at
surprise, said, " that he wâ€¢u"d' take till to-morrow, to consider
of the propriety of giving his own check in exchange for it."'
The clerk urged an immediate exchange of checks, declaring,
"c that although he was not authorised by the cashier to give such
" notice, he was confident the amount of the forged check would
" be retained by the bank, in their account with Mr. Levy." The
clerk deposed, that Mr. Levy thereupon ansivered: ":.On that
" score we are perfectly agreed: if the check is a forgery, it is
"no deposit; but I wish sometime to ascertain the fact." OA the
4th of August, however, Mr. Levy informed the president of the
bank, that he Wuould not refund the money, nor allow the entry
to his credit, to be erased from his bank book. He then drew a
check on thebank, for the balance of his account, which was
paid, except to the amount of the forged check; and to recover
that amount, the present action was instituted.
It, also, appeared in evidence, that Thomas's forgeries were
.Suspected by individuals, so early as the 31st of Yuly, but the
fact was not generally known till the 3d of August 1798; that
between 9 and 10 o'clock of the night of the 3d of August, he
executed, in Philadelphia,an assignment of his property, in trust
for the benefit of his creditors; and that an hour, or two, afterwvards, he absconded from the city.
The cause, upon these facts, underwent three several arguments: ist, on the trial before the jury; 2d, on a motion for a
new trial; and, 3d, on a writ of error, in the High Court of Errors

of the plaintiff; and the points of argument, and the authorities

--

cited, were the same, throughout the discussion.
For the plaintiff, it was contended, 1st. That the entry in the
bank book, was tantamount to a payment, in cash, of the forged
check; and that it is on the ground of that payment, not of the
forger,, the plaintiff claims. 2d. That the bank, the drawees of
the check, had no power to rescind, or annul, the payment, on
account of the subsequent discovery of the forgery. 3d. That
the plaintiff's sudden miscnception of his legal rights, in his conversftion with the clerk of the bank, did not constitute a promise
to refund, in law, equity, or conscience. And the following authoriu.cs were cited, in the course of the argument: 2 Stra. 946.

.For the defendant, it was co'ntended, 1st. That the entry to
the plaintiff's credit, in the bank book, was made by mistakewas corrected as soon as it was discovered; and was not, in its

nature, or in mercantile usage, equivalent to a payment in cash.
2d. That although there were some features of similitude, between bills and checks, they were not so strictly analogous, (for
instance, there is no acceptance of a check, and so it is not taken
on the acceptor's credit) that all the principles applicable in the one
case, must govern in both cases. 3d. That the acceptor of a bill
of exchange it not precluded from showing, that the drawer's
hand writing is forged, in an action brought by the payee.
4th. That the plaintiff's conversation with the clerk of the bank
amounted to a promise to refund; or, at least, induced the bank
to suspend any inquiry for Thomas. 5th. That the plaintiff is not
entitled to recover, because he claims through a felony. And

The COURT delivered a charge to the jury decidedly in favour
of the plaintiff; the Chief _7ustice declaring, that he thought any
attempt to distinguish between a credit in the bank book of a
customer, and an actual cash payment, as impolitic on the part
of the bank, as it was unjust towards the individual, who accepted the credit, instead of his money.
The verdict found for the plaintiff the sum demanded, and
inte-est: and. (after an ineffectual motion for a new trial, as above
stated) a judgment was rendered upon the verdict, which was
affrmed upon a writ of error.
