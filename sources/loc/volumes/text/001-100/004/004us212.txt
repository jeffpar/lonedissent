SUPREME COURT
OF

PENNSYLVANIA.

September Term 1800.
The Commonwealth versus Fitch.
cERTIAORfRI, to remove the judgment and proceedings in a
ase offorcible entry and dtainer, from Luzerne county,.
The inquisition stated, " That Nathan Beach was posse.ssed in
" his demesne as of fee, &c. and continued so seised.and posses"1 sed, until the defendant did enter, and hir the said Nathan
" Beach thereof disseised,' &c.
It was objected, that the prosecutor is stated to have been only
posses.ed of the premises, whereas the evidence proved him to
have been seised.
But by the CoURT: There is s6me informality in the expressions; but, surely, stating that the prosecutor was disseised, necessarily implies a previous seisin.
Judgment affirmed.

Sharp versus Pettit.

W RIT of dower. The inquisition states, that the husband
X
did not die seised of the premises; and finds damages for
the detention of dower, with costs.
Ross moved to quash the inquisition, so far as respects the
damages and costs.
By the COURT: It must be so; but let judgment be entered
for the demandant, without damages, or costs.
