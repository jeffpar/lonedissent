SUPREME COURT
OF

PENNSYLVANIA.

September Term 1804.
Commonwealth versits Matlack.

T

HE defendant had been clerk of the Senate; and in thatcharacter received 900 dollars, as a fund to defray the contingent expenses of ihe Ihouse, during several sessions. The Committee of accounts called upon him for a settlement; but he declined exhibiting his vouchers, unless they would allow him a
certain retrospective compensation, to which he contended that
he was entitled, under an act passed on the 22d of April 1794.
The Senate thereupon directed the comptroller to institute ti
present suit. Upon the trial, the defendant proved, that he had
expended considerably more money, than he had received, for
the use of the house; and he claimed a verdict for the amount
of his advances, as well as for the additional compensation allowed by the act of 1794.
But, after argument, the COURT declared, that the defendant
could not indirectly recover from the state, a substantive, independent, claim by way of set-off, any more than he could directly
recover a debt due from the state, by bringing a suit against her.
That the present action was brought to compel an account for
money received for the use of thL Senate; in which the defendant, if he proved, that the money received was so applied, would.
be entitled to a verdict; but that even then, he could not be entitled to a verdict for the amount of his advances; which the
Senate alone was cou.petent ta alow.
Verdict, generally, for the defendant.
.'Kean, attorney-general, for the commonwealth.
Dallas, for the defendant.
