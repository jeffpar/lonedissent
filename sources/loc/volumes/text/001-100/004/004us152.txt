The defendant's counsel then objected to the competency of
1796.
the witness, on account of his interest in the bank. They inL
sisted, that although this appeared after a cross examination, it
was sufficient for the rejection of his evidence altogether; and,
that, consequently, as there was no proof of notice, independent
of his evidence, the plaintiff must be nonsuited.
The COURT concurring, clearly and explicitly, in the opinion
of the defendant's counsel,
The plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.

Bell versus Andrews,

T

HIS was an action on the case, to recover damages, for the
brach of an agreement to sell and convey to the plaintiff,
in fee simple, a tract of land in T14strnore/andcounty.
The plaintiff offered parol evidence of the agreement, as stated
in the declaration; -of a payment of the price of the land; of the
defendant's subsequent acknowledgmtnt of the sale and payment;
and of the defendant's refusal to execute a conveyance.
The defendant objected to any proof of a parol agreement, for
the sale of lands in fee simple, as the act for prevcntion of frauds
and perjuries (1 State Law., 640. DalL.edit.) required, expressly,
that all such agreements, to have the full effect, must be put in
witing, and be signed by the parties, or their agents.
But, by the COURT: The payment of the consideration
money, may, certainly, be proved by parol evidence. The agreemert, being then executed by one of the parties,.is not affccted
by the act of assembly; and it is settled, that the Enq '/h statute against fr-auds and perjuries, was never extended to .Pennsylvania. The act of assembly does not make a parolagreement,
Ibr the sale of lands, void; though it restricts the operation of
the agreement, as to the acquisition of an interest in the land,
and no title in fee simple can be derived under it. But, certainly,
an action will lie to recover damages fbr the non-performance of
such an agreement.
The objection to the evidence over-ruled.
