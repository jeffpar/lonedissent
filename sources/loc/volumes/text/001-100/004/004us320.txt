SUPREME COURT
or

PENNSYLVANIA.

March Term 1805
Welsh versus Mun'ay.
ASE stated for the opinion of the Court. On the Ist of
_1u!gust 1804, judgment was entered, by confession, at the
suit of Ew1ing v..'Hurray, in the Common Pleas of .Philadelphia
county; in which the declaration was entitled of June term preceding. On the 3d of August 1804, judgment was entered, by
confession, in the Supreme Court, against the same defendant, at
the suit of We/sh, the present plaintiff; and the declaration was
entitled as of 2farch term preceding.
The question submitted was, which judgment was entitled to
a priority of payment, from the proceeds of the sale of the del"endant's real estate?
(

Mallace, on behalf of Welh, the present plaintiff, contended,
that the Supreme Court judgment, though, in fact, last entered,
had a legal relation to AMarch term; and must be preferred to
the Common Pleas judgment, which related only to J7une term.
He cited authorities to show the relation at common law: 14
Vin. .ibr.616. 12 .od. 519. 3 BI. CGon. 4.20. 6 .iMod. 191. Telv.
35. 3 Burr. 1596. 1 T'W7Lr. 39. 2Saund. 9. And lie argued, that
neither the English statute of frauds, nor the Penmylvania act
of assembly, affected the legal relation of a judgment, except
only in the case of bond fide purchasers; not in the case of conflicting judgments. 3 P. Tfrns. 398. Salk. 401. 7 Jlfod. 39. Salk.

Rawle, in support of the Common Pleas judgment, remarked, 1805.
that his opponent was not content to enjoy an equality, but insisted upon a preference; and, therefore, there was no equity in.
his favour. He then contended, that there was an essential difference between the law of -England, and the law of Penn-y!vania, on the subject; that, although the question would oftenarise here, as lands were subject to execution and sale, it woul L
seldom arise there; that the practice had uniformly been to pay
judgments, out of the sale of real estates, according to the actual
date of entering them; (1) and that the point had already been
adjudged in Hooton v. Will. 1 Dall. Rep. 185. 450.
By the COURT: We are clearly 'of opinion, that the judgment
first entered, is entitled to be first paid. The plaintiff in the Coinmon Pleas must, therefore, enjoy his preference. (2)

Dupont versus Pichon.

T

HE plaintiff had issued a capias against the defendant, in
an action upon the case, &c. and a citation was served upon
him, in the following terms:
(1) The following certificates were founded on the fact of practice:
"I certify, that while I held the.office of sheriff for the city and county of
Philadelphia,I uniformly settled the payment of judgments, in the case of
sales of real estates, according to the actual dates of those judgments certilied by the respective prothonotaries, without rerirence to the terms, of which
the said judgments -iere entered.
JAMES ASH."
Philadelphia, Decemlrk 18th, 1804.
" I certify that the above was also my praetice, while I held the office of
sbleriff,
ISRAEL ISRAEL.':

*' I certify that the above was also my practice, while I held the office of
sheriff.
JOHN BAKER."
(2) A question of priority of judgments, also, arose in the Common Pleas,
of Idladelfihia county at -7une term 1806, in the case of .Em.nel v. Garwood.
It was on a case stated, between two creditors of the defendant, each of
whom had entered judgment, by virtue of a bond and warrant, on the sante
day, at the distance of a few hours. It was held by the COURT (RusH, president) that there should be no precedence betweeu the judgments; but that the.
proceeds of the sales, which arose from real estate, should be divided.
The reason chiefly assigned by the President, was the inconvenience of a
contrary rule, there being several courtÂ§, in which judgment might be entered
on the same day; and the authority on which he chiefly relied was lord Forcqetecrs case, as stated by Buller in 1 Durnford ard Ea-.T. 118.
.ielnor for the second creditor.
