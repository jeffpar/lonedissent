had been subpoenaed as a witness in the case of Synes's
Lessee v. Irwine, which was marked for trial at the present
term, but was continued on the 20th of April. He was arrested
on the 26th of April; and the following day, Levy moved, that
he should be discharged from the arrest and process, on account
of the privilege of a witness, eundo, morando, et redeundo. 4 Com.

By the COURT. The witness is, undoubtedly, privileged from
arrest, for a reasonable time, to prepare for his departure, and
return to his home, as well as during his actual attendance upon
the Court. But the privilege does not extend throughout the
term, at which the cause is marked for trial; nor will it protect
him while the witness is engaged in transacting- his general private business, after he is discharged from the obligation of the
subpeona.
