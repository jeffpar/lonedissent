If the court below deny an order for farther proof when it ought to be
granted, or allow it when it ought to be denied, and the objection is
taken by the party, and appears on the record, the appellate court
can administer the proper relief.
But, if evidence in the nature of farther proof be introduced, and
no formal order or objection appear on the record, it must be
presumed to have been done by consent, and the irregularity is
waived.
Concealment, or spoliation of papers, is not, per se, a sufficient -round
for condemnation in a prize court. It is calculated to excite the
vigilance and justify the suspicions of the court; but is op.n to explanation: and if the party, in the first instance fairly, frankly, and
satisfactorily explains it, he is deprived of no right to which he is
otherwise entitled. If, on the contrary, the spoliation is unexplaiaea, or "be explanation is unsatisfactory; if the cause labour under
heai'y 'suspicions, or gross prevarications; farther proof is denied,
and condemnation ensues from defects in the evidence which the
party is not permitted to supply.
Under the Spanish treaty of 1795, stipulating that free ships shall
make free goods, the want of such a sea letter or passport, or such
certificates as are described jo. the 17th article, is nota substantive
ground of condemnation. It only authorizes capture and sending in
for adiudication, and the proprietary interest in the shin may be
proved by other equivalent testimony. But if, upon the original
evidence, the cause appears extremely doubtful and suspicious, and
farther proo is necessary, the grant or denial of it rests on the same
g-neral rules which govern the discretion of prize courts in ot"cases.
The term " subjects," in the 15th article, when applied to persons
owing allegiance to Spain, must be construed in the same sense as
the term " citizens," or "inhabitants," when applied to persons
owing allegiance to the United States, and extends to all persons
domiciled in the Spanisl) dominins.

APPEAL

from the circuit court of the district of

Georgia.
The ship Pizarro, under Spanish colours, was captured on the 23d of July, 1814, by the private armed
schooner Midas, Alexander Thompson, commander,
on a voyage from Liverpool'to Amelia Island, and
brought into the port of Savannah for adjudication.
lrize proceedings were instituted in the district
court of Georgia against the ship and cargo,. and a
claim was duly interposed by Messrs. Hibberson and
Yonge, merchants, of Fernandina, Amelia Island,
for the ship and -cargo, as their sole and exclusive
property. Upon the final hearing in the district
court, the ship and cargo were decreed tobe restored,
and this decree was, upon an appeal to the circuit
court, affirmed; and fiom the decree of the circuit court the cause was brought by appeal to this
court.
It appears from the evidence, that during the
voyage a package, containing papers respecting the
cargo, directed to Messrs. Hibberson and Yonge,
was thrown overboard by the advice and assent of
the master and supercargo. The reason alleged for
this proceeding is, that they were then chased by a
schooner, which-they supposed to be a Carthaginian
privateer. The ship's documents, however, were

OF THE UNITED STATES.

retained, in which her Spanish character is distinctly
asserted.
These documents were as follows: 1. A certifirate of the Spanish consul at Liverpool, dated the
11th of September, 1813, certifying that the Pizarro
was a Spanish ship, bound to Corunna. 2. *A certificate from the same, of the same date, that Messrs.
Hughe4 and Duncan had shipped 250 tons of salt on
board the Pizarro for Corunna, consigned to Messrs.
Hibberson and Yonge. 3. A certificate of health,
dated at F6rnandina, the 20th of December, 1813.
4. A letter from Messrs. Hibberson and Yonge, of
tht 10th January, 1814, to J. Walton, the navigator
or sea pilot, ordering him to sail to Liverpool. 5. A
bill of lading, -signedby Martinez, the master, for the
outward cargo. " 6.-The affidavit of Messrs. Hibberson and Yonge, that they had shipped the same
cargo on their own account, consigned to Messrs.
Hughes and Duncan, &c. 7. The shipping articles
from Amelia Island to St. Augustine, or any other
port in Europe, and back, dated the 1 1th of January,
1814. 8.. Shipping articles from Liverpool to St.
Augustine, and back to Liverpool, without a date.
9. A license from the governor of East Florida, authorizing Messrs. Hibbergon and Yonge to buy a vessel in the United States, and the copy of a bill of
sale from Messrs. S. and W. Hale, of New-Hampshire, by their agent Kimbell, dated the 24th of
February, 1813, together with an order of the governor, of the 6th of March, 1813, naturalizing the
ship, or permitting her to sail tnder Spanish colours,

Mr. Tinder, for the appellhnts and captors. 1.
The proprietary interest in the claimants is not proved. 2. They are excluded from the benefit of farther proof by the spoliation of papers. The court
below made no order for farther proof; yet it seems
to have been admitted and considered by'that court,
and has urept into the transcript of the record. This
was an irregularity, which will be corrected by the
appellate tribunal, since the case on the original evidence was free frpm doubt or difficulty, And condemnation ought to have 'ensued. The spoliation of
papers is not satisfactorily accounted for by the master and supercargo, who have prevaricated in their
examinations; and the spoliation being unexplained,
inevitably leads to the exclusioh of farther proof, and,
consequently, to condemnation. In the case of the
Two Brothers,a spoliation of papers, not being avowed with sufficient frankness by the master, was held
to destroy his credit; and the defect of proof thereby
induced, together with other circumstances, was'
deemed a cause of condemnation. In the present

case, all the documents relative to the cargo were

was rejected by the. English court of admiralty in
the Rising Sun. . Destroying the papers which might
-show the Spanish character of the cargo could not
diminish the dapger of capture by Carthaginian privateers, since the ship would still appear to be Spanish, and this, together with the want of documentary
evidence as to the cargo, would involve both in the
same fate. This explanation of the suppression of
the papers is, therefore, weak and futile, and such as
cannot relieve the parties from the imputation of
malafiQes. 3. The claimants contend, that the cargo
is exempt from confiscation by the, Spanish treaty of
1795, which recognises the rule, that free ships make
free goods.' But the term "subjects," in the 15th

So, also, in this case, the Spanish character of the

Mr. Key and the ltlorney-Gener'a for the respondents and claimants. 1.Even the total want of
papers is not a substantive ground of condemnation:
it may be explained, as Sir William Scott observes
in the Btse,, alluding to the the ancient French law,
2. Nor is the spoliation of papers conclusive to exclude
farther proof, and never has been so held by any
tribunal whose decisions this court will respect.' In
this case the stupid and artless manner in which iho
agents of the owners acted is a proof that the latter
didnot participate in, nor can they be made 'penally
responsible for, the misconduct of the former. 3.
If the owner of the ship was a domiciled subject of
Spain, the ship, and, consequently, the cargo, is entitled to' protection under the 'treaty. Commercial
domicil stamps ,a national character for every purpose in the view of a court of prize; and if the oieration of the treaty, were confined to Spanish subjecis
(properly so-called,) while it is extended to all persons inhabiting the United States, it would be unaccountably deticient in reciprocity'. What forlifies
the contrary construction 'is, that the term subjiects
is several times used indiscriminately in the treaty to
signify the inhabitants of both countries. The purpose for Whicti the documents prescribed by the
treaty are required shows that a'merely formal defect only authorizes detention and sending in for

duced, restitution must follow, though the captors T. -,.
are exempt from costs and damages. Equivalent
testimony is that which satisfactorily proves the same
thing as that in which there was defective proof
before; and the proof we have produced is testimony more than equivalent. The form of passport .alluded to in the 17th article is not annexed to the treaty, nor is it to be found in the department of state.
The Spaniards have relied on the good faith with
which this country has always fulfilled its engagements; they have neglected the form, and relied on
the spirit of the stipulation. The papers produced
are, therefore, equivalent to a formal passport; and
there is no rule by which they can be excluded, as
there was no attending circumstance of fraud in the
destruction of the original documents, and, consequently, the case isunaffected by that vala fides
which precludes explanation from extrinsic testimony.

court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:
A preliminary objection has been taken in the
argument at bar to the regularity of the proceedings
in this cause, and it is urged, with great earnestness
and force, that the farther proof was not admissible
except under an explicit order of the court for this
purpose; and thai the conduct of the master arid supercargo:in the suppression of the documents of the
cargo, and in prevaricating in their examination, has

have to introduce the farther proof.
The proceedings in the district court were cer-

tainly very irregular; and this court cannot but re-

gret that so many deviations from the correct prize
practice should have occurred at so late a period of
the war. The ship's papers ought to have been
brought -into court, and verified, on oath, by the captors., and the examinations of the captured crow
ought to have been taken upon the standing interrogatories, and not viva voce in open court.. Nor
should the captured crew have been permitted to
be re-examined in court. They are bound to declare the whole truth upon their first examination;
and if they then fraudulently suppress any material
facts, they ought not to be indulged with an opportunity to disclose what they please, or to give colour
to their former statements after counsel has been
taken, and they know the pressure of the cause.
Public policy and justice equally point out the necessity of an inflexible adherence to this rule.
It is upon the ship's papers, and the examinations
thus taken in preparatory, that the cause ought, in
the first instance, to be heard in the district court;
and upon such hearing it is to judge whether the
cause be of such doubt as to require farther proof;
and if so, whether the claimant has entitled himself
to the benefit of introducing it. If the court should
deny such order when it ought to be granted, or allow it when it ought to be denied, and the objection
be taken by the party and appear upon the record,
the appellate court can administer the proper relief.

If, however, evidence in the nature of farther proof 1817.

been done by consent of parties, and the irregularity is completely waived. In the present case, no
exception was taken to the proceedings or evidence
in the district court; and we should -not, therefore,
incline to reject the farther proof, even if we were
of opinion that it ought not, in strictness, to have
been admitted.
The objection, which is urged against the admission of the farther proof would, under other circumstances, deserve great consideration. Concealment, or
even spoliation of papers, is not of itself a sufficient
ground for condemnation in a prize court. It i., undoubtedly, a very awakening circumstance, calculated to excite the vigilance, and justify the suspicions
of the court. But it is a circumstance open to explanation, for it may have arisen from acdident, necessity, or superior force; and if the party in the
first-instance fairly and frankly explains it to the satisfaction of the court, it deprives him of no right to
which he is otherwise entitled. If, on the other
band, the spoliation be unexplained, or the explanation appear weak and futile; if the cause labour
under heavy suspicions, or there be a vehement presumption of bad faith, or gross prevarication, it is
made the ground of a denial of farther proof, and
condemnation ensues from defects in the evidence
which the party is not permitted to supply.

of testimony by the master and supercargo., No.
thing can be more loose and unsatisfactory than their
first examinations; and the new and circumstantial

details given upon their second examinations are inconsistent with the notion of perfect good faith in
the first instance.

The excuse, too, for throwing

the packet of papers overboard is certainly not
easily to be credited; for the ship's documents which
still remained on board would, in the view of a Carthagenian privateer, have completely established a
Spanish'character. It is not, indeed, very easy to
assign an adequate motive for the destruction of the
papers. If the ship was Spanish, it was, as to American cruisers, immaterial to whom the cargo belonged; for, by our treaty .vith Spain, (treaty of
1795, art. 15.,) declaring that free ships shall make
free goods, the property of an enemy on board of
sich a ship is just as much protected from capture
as if it were neutral. The utmost, therefore, that
this extraordinary conduct can justify on the part 9f
the court is to institute a more rigid scrutiny into the
character of the ship itself. If her national Spanish
character be satisfactorily made-out in evidence, the
spoliation of the documentary proofs of the cargo will
present no insuperable bar to a restitution. Very
different would be the conclusion, if th6 case stood
upon the ground of the law of nations, unaffected by
the stipulations of a treaty.

Upon a full examination of the evidence we are of
opinion that the Spanish character of the ship is entirely sustained, and, therefore, the claimants are entitled to a decree of restitution. Two objections have
been urged against this conclusion: 1. That the
ship is not documented actcording to the requisitions
I

of the treaty with Spain, and, therefore, not within
the protection of that treaty. 2. That it does not
party, or other papers respecting
the lading of the vessel, is declared cause of condemnation. And
by the ordinance of August. 1681,
Des Prisa, trL6, all vessels, on
board of which no charter party,
bills of lading, or invoices are to
be. found, are, together with their
cargoes, declared good prize.
Doubts having arisen as to the
uapplication of this rule of evidence, in, cases where sufficient
papers were found remaining on
board, to furnish proof of the proprietary interest, the ordinance of
the- th Sept., 1708, was rendered; by which itwas provided, that
every captured vessel, from which
papers have been thrown overboard, shall be god prize, together with the cargo, upon proof of
this fact alone, without its being
necessary to examine into the hature of the papers destroydd, nor
to inquire whether sufficient papers were found remaining on
board to furnisli evidence that the
ship and the goods of .her lading
belonged to allies or friends. But

appear that Mr. Hibberson (who is a native of
Great Britain) has ever been naturalized in the dominions of Spain, and therefore he is not a subjca of
Spain, within the meaning of the treaty.
As to the first objection, it is certainly true that
the ship was not furnished with such a sea letter, or
passport, or such certificates as are described in
the 17th article of the treaty. But the want of such
docu,ents is no substantive ground for condemnation. It only justifies the capture, and authorizes
ihe captors to send the ship into a proper port for
adjudication. The treaty expressly declares, that
Wfhen ships shall be found without such requisiteb,
they may be sent into port, and adjudged by the
competent tribunal; and "that all the circumstances of this omission having been well examined,
they shall be adjudged to be legal prizes, unless they
shall give legal satisfaction of their property by testimony entirely equivalent." It is apparent, from
Cember, 1779, restoring the captured vessel, notwithstanding some
papers had been thrown overboard, it being proved that the
papers were not of such a nature
as to show the property enemy's,
and the master not being accessary to the spoliation. See the

to the property. And, certainly, by the general
of nations, as well as by the particular stipulations of
the treaty, the parties would be at liberty to give
farther explanations of their conduct, and to make
other proofs of their property. If, indeed, upon the
original evidence, the cause should appear extremely doubtful or suspicious, and farther proof should
be necessary, the grant or denial of it would rest upon the same general principles which govern the
discretion of prize courts in other cases. But in the
present case, there is no necessity for such farther
proof, since the documents and testimony now before
us, are, in our -pinion, as to the proprietary interest
'in*the ship, entirely equivalent to the passports and
-sea-letter required by the treaty.
As to the second objection, it assumes, as its basis,
'that the term "subjects," as used in the treaty, applies only to persons who, by birth or naturalization,
owe a permanent allegiance to the Spanish government. It is, in our opinion, very clear that such is
not the true interpretation of the language. The
provisions of the treaty are manifestly designed to
give reciprocal and co-extensive privileges to both
countries; and to effectuate this object, the term
" subjects," when applied to persons owing allegiance to Spain, must be construed in the same sense
as the term "citizens," or "inhabitants," when applied to persons owing allegiance to the United
States. What demonstrates the entire propriety of
this construction is, that in the 18th article of the

CASES IN THE SUFREME COURT

treaty, the'terms. "subjects," "people," and "inlia.
bitants," are indiscriminately used as synonymous, to
Ue.Marro. designate the same persons in both countries, and
in
cases obviously within the scope of-the prece ding articles. Indeed, in the language of the law of nations,
which is always to Ie consulted in the interpretation
of treaties, a person doniiciled in a country, and onjoying the protection of its sovereign, is deemed a
subject of that country. He owes allegiance to the
country, while he resides in it; temporary, indeed, if
he has not, by birth or naturalization, contracted a
permanent allegiance'; but so fixed that, as to all other
nations, he follows the character of that country, in
war as well as in peace, The mischiefs of a different construction would be very great; for it might
then be contended that ships owned by Spanish subjects could be protected by the treaty, although they
were domiciled in a foreign country, with which we
were at war; and yet the law of nations would, in
such a predicament, pronounce them enemies. Wâ‚¬
should, therefore, have no hesitation in over-ruling
this objection, even if it were proved that Mr. Hibberson was not a naturalized subject of Spain; but we
think the presumption very strong that he had become, in the strictest sense of the words, a Spuanish,
subject.
The Spanish character of the ship being ascertained, it is unnecessary to inquire into the proprietary interest of the cargo, unless so far as to ascertain that it does not belong to citizens of the United
States; for the treaty would certainly not protect the
property of American citizens trading with the one1817.

the evidence, that any American. interest is concerned in the shipment. The whole property belonged
either to British subjects or to the claimants, and we

it to belong as claimed.
