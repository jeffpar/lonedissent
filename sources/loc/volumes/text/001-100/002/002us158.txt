rIDHE defendant was fued, as indorfor of a promiffory note,
JL drawn by S. Sidan, on the ioth February, 1785, payable
in.forty-five days. Notice was given to Sidman on the day it

became due, and to M'Knight four or five days after; which
the defendant now contended was too late.
By M'KEAN, Chief !fflice, (the other Judges declining t&
give any opinion on account of their intereft in the Bank). Before the revolution, it was not ufual to give notice to the indorfor, or even to call on the drawer, as foon as a note became due;
it would have been confidered as harfh and unreafonable. But
fince the eftablifhment of the bank, a rule has been introduced;
and as thefe notes, lodged in the bank, were often -accommodation notes, it was highly reafonable that notice fhould be given
in aJhort time. What thattime ought to be has not been determined. Two or three months would certainly be too long,
and a day may be too fhort. I would notfngly law down a rule,
but leave it to the Jury as a queflion of fa&. They muft therefore judge for themfelves, taking into confideration the ufual
praaice at that time.'*
