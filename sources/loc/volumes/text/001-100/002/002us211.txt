FOREIGN attachment iffued in the Common Pleas of

Philadelphia, returnable to March Term, 1788, at the'
the plaintiffs againif Jofeph Waldo, and the defendants
of
fuit
were fummoned as garnifLhee-. Judgmcnt being entered at the
third Term, a writ of enquiry was executed, and the fum of
was,
'£3,778 9 9 was found in damages. A &cire Facias
thereupon, iffued againft the garnifhees, returnable to March
Term, 1789 ; bui the caufe was removed "nto this Court by a
writ of Certiorari, returnable to 7uly Temn, 1789; and was
tried on the 24 th of September .79 ; when the Jury found a
verdi& for the plaintiffs for

£1,204 12

4 1-2 ; and, at the in-

flance of their Counfel, added the following words it the bar,
which the Court dire&ed to be entered in the Record,-" being
cc exclufive of certain outftanding debts, and exclufive alfo,
c of a bond for £10oo

from the garnifhees to

Valdo, dated

c the 17 th of .November 1786, and payable the I 7 th of Ro" vember, 1790 ;" which bond was admitted in the garnifhees'

anfwers to interrogatories filed by the plaintiff. On this verdit, judgment was entered geri'rally; and, the time for paying the bond having elapfed; a Scire Faias, returnable to Yanuary Term, 1792, was iffued upon the judgment, requiring
the garnifhees to fh'ew caufe why execution fhould not iffue for
the amount.
The queftions arifing upon thefe fa&s were fubmitted to the
Court, upon a motion to quafh the cire Facias, which was argued by Cox, Rawle, and Dallas, for the garnifhees ; and by
Ingei~oll, Lewis and M'Kean, for the plaintiffs.
For the garn)ees it was contended, I ft, That no -verdi&,
or judgment had been given for the bond ; in refpe&t to that,
as well as to the outftanding debts, the language is exclufive;
and what is excluded cannot be included. Where there is no
verdi&, there can be no judgment ; for, the confideration of the
Court is on the finding of the Jury : A judgment mufl. be warranted by the verdi&.- A verdi& is void in all cafes where it
fines the matter in iffue, by way of argument. 5 Corn. Dig.

Dal. Edit. p. 734BY THE COURT :-This Seite Faciasis iffued to revive ana
"effecuate a judgment obtained in this Court; and, therefore,
is regularly inifituted here. It is true, -that a bond is affignable,
in Pennflvania ; but if the bond in queftioAi had been atually
affigned, the fa&t might have been pleaded to the former Scire
Facika. As to the quefti6n, whether the debt was liable to attachment,'-we have no doubt. It was debitum in prefentifdoendum infuturo: And it has been the uniform confliu&ion of
the a& of Affembly, -that fuch debts weie affected by the attachment.
It mufl be allowed, that the judgment is, in' fome degree,
informally entered ; but we can have no difficulty in fixing the
meaning of the Jury, though their verdit might have been
.better expreffed. The faCt, indeed, being admitted in the an-,
fwers of the garnifliees to the interrogatories, judgmint woduld
have been given on motion; and, of courie,.on all the fa&s
.9wftated, we are equally competent to decide.
et judgment be entered for the plaintiffs.
