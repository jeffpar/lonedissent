of Affembly would be rendered perfpicuous and intelligible,
without the addition of any words, by expunging the femicoIon, and the monofyllable " or" : But even that is unneceffary
to fupport the profecution ; fince the words fpoken tended to
excite refiftance to the Government of this Commonwealth, to
perfuade the audience to return to a dependence upon the Crown
of Great Britain, and to favor the enemy; which are diftin&
and fubftantive charges of mifprifion of treafon.
It is proper to add, that the words muft be fpoken with a malicious and mifchievous intention, in order to render them criminal : A mere loofe and idle converfationj without anay wickednefs of heart, may be indifcreet and reprehenfible, but ought
not to be confirued into mifprifion of treafon. On the other
hand, drunkennefs is no juftification, or excufe, for committing
the offence ; to allow it as fuch, would open a door for the
pra~ice of the greateft enormities with impunity.
