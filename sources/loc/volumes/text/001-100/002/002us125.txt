CHIEF JUSTICE, and Judge SHiPPEN, on the 28th April, 1791.

A preliminary queffion arifing, who fhould open the caufe,
it was decided BY THE COURT, after argument, that the proof
of the ifflue lay upon the defendant : and that he, therefore,
ought to begin. The CrnEF JusTrcE added, that in all cafes,
the party who is firft in the affirmative ought regularly to open;
and referred to Forfythe verfus J7ones, tried at Njfi Prius, in
Ckefler County, where the fame point was ruled.
On the trial of the caufe, the defendant gave in evidence thb
record of a trial, verdi&, and judgment, between the fame
parties, at a former period; to wit, in the year 1755. The'

plaintiff, was not then produced, nor difcovered : But the proof
was obje6ted to, and the-Court refufed to admit it.
BY THE COURT :-It

recolle6tion of a witnefs in fo old a tranfation, in order to fhake
the ftrength of the evidence, which the record imports.
