SUPREME COURT OF PeftnfjlVania. ,95

a wltnefs at a great diftance inWaf/jington County ; but that neither the witnefs, nor the perfon employed to ferve the fubpxena,
attends.
This would not, in ftri&nefs, be a fufficient
ground for putting off the caufe: But it muft be rememn,
bered, that the defendant, once before, at a confiderable expence,
brought the fame witnefs to Court ;. and when the caufe was
continued, without any fault imputable to him, he took the witnefs's depofition. Having thus, on a former, as well as on the
pcefent, occafion, purfued every preparatory "Rep,which the
law requires, to procure the attendance of the witnefs, we
think it would be unreafonable to take advantage ofany accident,
that may have happened to. the meffenger.

Br THE COURT :-The intereft of the refiduary legatee is,
