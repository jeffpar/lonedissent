UDGMENT was entered in this caufe on the Ift day of
September Term, 1796 ; and the plaintiff iffued a T6ltm
Fi. Fa. to Allegheny County, founded on a .Fi. Fa. to the flieriff of Philadelphia County, which was made returnable on the
!aft day of September Terni 1796, but had never been a~tually
taken out, though it was minuted on the roll. The Tfdlatuwn Fi.
Fa. being levied on lands, .E Tilghman now moved to fet the
writ afide, as being founded on a Pi. Fa. not legally or properly returnable.
But, BY" THE COURT :-TRlie prefent cafe appears manifeffly
to be incl uded in the words of the a& of Affembly, which declares, " that the laft day, as well as the firft day, of every
Teri, fhall be a common day of return in this Court, at either
of which periods any writs, original, mefne, brjudicial procefs,
&c. may be made returnable ; and that the writs and procefs
returnable on the laft day of the Term, flall be as valid and ef.
fe&ual in all cafes, and to all intents and purpofes, as if the
fame had been made returnable on the firft day of the Texin,"
3 Stdte Laws p6. 770. Dallas's Edition.
"Wedo not mean, however, to give any opinion at this time,
as to the effe& of fuch a proceeding in charging bail, or levying
upon lands, within the county, in wurhich the judgment was rendered
Rule refufed.
