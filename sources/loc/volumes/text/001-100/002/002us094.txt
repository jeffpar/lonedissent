2. It was.obje&ed, on the-part of the defendant, that the
.Fi. Fa. by viitue of which the lands in queftion had been fold,
only dire&ed the jheriff rto levy of the goods and chattels, &c.which is not an authority to take the lands in execution.
BY TH CouRT :-Lands are to be confidered as chattels in
Penfylvania, for the payment of debts. In fome 'countie' of
this State, and throughout the State of .Delaware, the writs of
Fi. Fa. always iffue in that form. It is laid, that ther precedents mention" Lands and Tenements" ; but this has not been
proved, as it ought to be,. by producing in Court fuch precedents before, at the time, and fubfequent, to the iffuing of the
* writ. At moft, however, it is but an omiffion, in point ofform;
which is too Blender a foundation for overfetting a fheriffs fale
of lands.

This would not, in ftri&nefs, be a fufficient
ground for putting off the caufe: But it muft be rememn,
bered, that the defendant, once before, at a confiderable expence,
brought the fame witnefs to Court ;. and when the caufe was
continued, without any fault imputable to him, he took the witnefs's depofition. Having thus, on a former, as well as on the
pcefent, occafion, purfued every preparatory "Rep,which the
law requires, to procure the attendance of the witnefs, we
think it would be unreafonable to take advantage ofany accident,
that may have happened to. the meffenger.

prefent ejeCment was depending between the devifee, and one
claiming paramount to the devife v and the refiduary legatee,
was offered as a witnefs on behalf of the plaintiff.
It was contended by B;radford and Chambers, for the defendant, th.at the witnefs ought not to be admitted :- And they cited
