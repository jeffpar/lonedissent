ALANSON

SALTMIARSH V. JAMES

W.

TUTHILL.

Where an appeal was taken in a common-law case instead of a writ of error, and
after the lapse of ten days the plaintiff issued an execution upon his judgment, and
the defendant then sued out a writ of error to bring the case up to this court, it was
error in the court below to quash the execution and supersede the judgment.
The appeal did not remove the case, and the writ of error was sued out too late to

stay execution. It is immaterial whether it was a mistake of the party or the
court.
Thequestion resered is whether this court has the power to issue a mandamus to the
judge below, commanding him to set aside the supersedeas and order the clerk to
issuo an execution.

A MOTION was made for a mandamus in this case, to compel
the district judge to set aside an order of supersedeas and to
order the clerk to issue an execution.
The circumstances were these: At the fall term, 1849, of the District Court of the United
States for the Mliddle District of Alabama, Tuthill obtained a
judgment against Saltmarsh in a common-law case.
Saltmarsh took an appeal in open court, and at the same time
executed an appeal-bond, in a penalty of double the amount of
the'judgment.
After the expiration of ten days, Tuthill caused execution to
be issued on the judgment. Before the return of this writ, Saltmarsh sued out a writ of error, and filed a writ of error bond.
At the return term of the execution, viz., Iay, 1850, Salt.
marsh moved the court to quash the execution and to supersede
the judgment. Both motions were granted. The execution
was quashed, and it was further considered and ordered by the
court, that a writ of supersedeas be, and the same is hereby,
awarded, commanding the clerk of the District Court of the

SUPREME COURT.
Saltmarsh v. Tuthill.

United States for the Middle District of Alabama not to issue
execution, or any other process, on said judgment rendered at
the December term of this court, in the year of our Lord one
thousand eight hundred and forty-nine, while the writ of error
to the Supreme Court of the United States is pending, nor until
a decision is had thereon. And also to command the marshal
of the United States for the district aforesaid, that from every
and all proceedings on execution, or in anywise molesting the
plaintiff in error on account of the said judgment, he entixely
surcease, the same being superseded.
The writ of error having brought the case up to this court, a
motion was made by M r. Pryor and 31r. AS-eward for a mandamus to compel the district judge to set aside the order of supersedeas, and to order the blerk to issue an execution.
1. The order was void for the want of jurisdiction in the
court. There was no subject-matter in controversy of -hich
the court could take jurisdiction, to hear and determine. Judiciary Act 1789, ch. 20, sects. 22, 23; Act regulating appeals,

was improvidently exercised, and this court ought to issue the
mandamus. This court has a general superintending control
over inferior courts of the United States, and may issue such
process as is necessary to enable it to make this control effect,

Saltmarsh v. Tuthill.
-Mr. Campbell in

opposition to-the motion.

The 23d section of the Judiciary Act (1 Stats. at Large, 85,does not take away the power which existed in the courts to
grant a supersedeas upon the allowance of a writ of error. Tidd's
Practice, 1070 et seq.; 1 Arch. Prac. 517 et seq.; 10 Wend. 624;
7 Hill, 162; 3 How. 405; 2 Miles, 108.
The remedy by mandamus is not proper. Tillinghast &
Yates's Treatise, 449.
The remedy open to the plaintiff is a writ of error. 6 Pet.
648; 1 Bibb, 346; 1 Stew. & Port. 187; 9 Porter, 275.
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY delivered the opinion of the
court.
The judgment in this case being in a common-law proceeding,
it was not eremoved to this court by the appeal; and, consequently, the appeal-bond did not operate as a supersedeas.
The w.,rit of error afterwards sued out, has brought the case
regularly before this court. But as it was not sued out within
ten days after the rendition of the judgment, the writ of errorbond does not stay the execution under the act of 1789.
Nor is there any equitable power in the Circuit Court to stay
the execution, upon the ground that a mistake as to the manner
or time of removing the case was committed. And it is immaterial in this respect whether it was the mistake of the party or
the court. For this court has never deemed the tribunals of the
United States authorized to dispense with the express provisions
of the acts of Congress regulating appeals and writs of error,
upon any equitable ground. No such power is given to them
by law. It was so decided in this court in United States v.
Curry and others, 6 How. 113; and Hogan and others v. Ross,
11 Id. 297. The Circuit Court therefore erred in setting aside
the execution which the plaintiff had issued on the judgment.
But we do not think it necessary at this time to determine,
whether this court has the power to issue the mandamus, requiring the Circuit Court to issue the execution. Because we
are satisfied from the facts before us, that the Circuit Court,
without any coercive process, will conform to the opinion of
this court, and issue execution when informed of this decision.
The question, therefore, as to the power of this court to issue
the mandamus, is, for the present, reserved.
