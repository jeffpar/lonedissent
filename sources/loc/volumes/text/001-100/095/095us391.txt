THOMPSON V. MAXWELL.

THOMPSON v. MAxwpT.
1. None but parties and privies can have a bill of review; and it will not lie
where the decree in question was passed by consent.
2. A decree for carrying out a settlement and compromise of a suit, if obtained
without fraud, cannot be impeached.
3. Boffington v. Harvey, supra, p. 99, cited and approved.
4. As the bill in this case, before it was by amendment converted into a bill of
review, approximated to the character of a bill to carry the original decree
more effectually into execution, which was the appropriate remedy of the
complainants, the court, while reversing the decree, does not direct that the
bill be absolutely dismissed, but that the complainants be allowed to amend
it, with leave to defendants to answer any new matter therein introduced,
and that the proofs taken in the cause shall stand as proofs at any future
hearing thereof, with liberty to either party to take additional proof upon
any new matter that may be put in issue by the amended pleadings.

MR. JusTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.

In 1859, Alfred Bent and his two sisters, Estefana and
Teresina, with their husbands, filed a bill in chancery in the
District Court of the Territory of New Mexico for the Count)
of Taos, against Charles Beaubien, Guadalupe Miranda, Lucien
B. Maxwell, and Jos6 Pley, claiming and alleging that Charles
Bent, deceased, the father of Alfred and his sisters, at the
time of his death, was jointly interested with said Beaubien
and Miranda, to the extent of one-third part, in a certain specified tract of land in said territory, amounting to two millions
of acres, which had been granted to said Beaubien and Miranda
by the New Mexican government in 1841, and stood in their
names; and that as to said third part they were trustees for
said Charles up to the time of his death, and from thenceforward trustees for the said Alfred and his sisters as heirs-at-law
of said Charles. The bill further stated that Maxwell and
Pley pretended to have become interested in said land; and

V. MAXWELL.

[Sup. Ct.

prayed as against all the defendants that the title of said
Charles Bent to the third part thereof might be established,
and for a partition. Such proceedings were had in that suit,
that, on the 29th of May, 1865, a decree was made, establishing Bent's title to one undivided fourth part of the land, the
right of succession of the complainants, and adjudging that a
partition be made according to the prayer of the bill. Commissioners for making partition were appointed by the decree,
and ordered to report at the next term, the court reserving its
decree as to the partition and the costs of the cause.
After this decree was made, certain negotiations took place
between Maxwell (who had acquired the principal interest in
the property) and the complainants, looking to a settlement of
the controversy, and a purchase by Maxwell of the complainants' interest. Whether these negotiations were concluded in
Alfred Bent's lifetime, or not until after his death, subsequently became a matter of controversy between the parties.
He was accidentally killed on the 15th of December, 1865,
leaving a widow, Guadalupe Bent (who afterwards married
George W. Thompson), and three infant children, Charles,
Julian, and Alberto, his heirs-at-law.
The comriissioners for making partition never reported; and
the next proceeding in the cause, so far as appears by the
record, was an order made in April, 1866, making the infant
children and heirs of Alfred parties complainant, and continuing the cause. A few days afterwards, in the same term, the
following order was entered in the cause: "1By agreement of the parties, the continuance of this cause,
made on a former day of this term of this court, is set aside ; and, on
motion of solicitors for the complainants, Guadalupe Bent is hereby
appointed guardian ad litem and commissioner in chancery for the
minors of Alf'ed Bent in this cause, with full power to execute
deeds or carry into execution all sales or transfers made of her
[their?] interests in and to the real estate therein described to
Lucien B. Maxwell, one of the defendants in said cause, and that
this cause stand continued until the next term of this court."
On the third day of May, 1866, Guadalupe Bent, as guar
dian ad litem of Charles, Julian, and Alberto, and commissioner
under the foregoing order, executed a deed of conveyance in

Oct. 1877.]

THOMPSON V. MAXWELi.

fee to the said Maxwell for the one undivided twelfth part of
the property in question, belonging to the said Charles, Julian,
and Alberto, as heirs of their father. The sisters of Alfred,
with their husbands, executed deeds for their interest in the
lands about the same time.
In September Term, 1866, another decree (probably intended
as a substitute for the order made in April) was made in the
said cause, in the words following, to wit: "Whereas an interlocutory decree was rendered at a former term
of this court in the above cause, decreeing one-fourth of the land
mentioned in the petition herein to the complainants in this cause,
and appointing commissioners to divide and set apart the portion
so decreed; and whereas said interlocutory decree was never carried into effect; and whereas, since the time of the rendition of said
decree, a mutual agreement has been made between the parties to
this cause, settling and determining all the equities in the same:
"It is, therefore, hereby ordered, adjudged, and decreed, by the
mutual consent and agreement of the said complainants as well as
of the said defendants in this cause, that the interlocutory decree
above mentioned, together with all orders made under and by virtue of the same, be set aside; and, by the mutual consent and agreement of the said parties, it is hereby further ordered, adjudged, and
decreed that the said Lucien B. Maxwell, one of the defendants in
this cause, pay to the said complainants the sum of $18,000, to be
divided among them per stirpes; that is, to the said Aloys Scheurick and Teresina Bent, his wife, one-third part, and to Alexander
Hicklin and Estefana Bent, his wife, another third part, and to
Charles Bent, Julian Bent, and Alberto Silas Bent, the children
and heirs of Alfred Bent, deceased, the remaining third part, to be
equally divided among the said last named, and to be paid into the
hands of Guadalupe Bent, widow of the [said] Alfred Bent, deceased, and guardian ad litem for said children, for the purposes
of the said division.
"And, upon the further consent and agreement of the said parties, it is hereby further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the
said Alexander Hicklin and Estefana Bent, his wife, the said Aloys
Scheurick and Teresina Bent, his wife, and the said Guadalupe
Bent, guardian ad litem for Charles Bent, Julian Bent, and Alberto
Silas Bent, children and minor heirs of the said Alfred Bent,
deceased, within ten days from the date of this decree, make, execute, and deliver to the said Lucien B. Maxwell good and sufficient

deeds of conveyance of all their right, title, interest, estate, claim,
and demand of, in, and to the lands in controversy in this cause, the
said Guadalupe Bent, guardian ad litem as aforesaid, in the name
of Charles Bent, Julian Bent, and Alberto Silas Bent, minor heirs
as aforesaid, and the said Alexander Hicklin and Estefana Bent,
his wife, and the said Aloys Scheurick and Teresina Bent, his wife,
in their own names. And, by further consent and agreement between the said parties, it is hereby further ordered, adjudged, and
decreed that the costs of this suit shall be paid, each of the said
parties to pay the separate costs in the same made by themselves."
This last decree seems to have been the termination of proceedings in the cause. No further conveyances were executed,
and nothing else was done to carry the decree into effect.
On the first day of August, 1870, nearly four years after the
entry of the last decree, the proceedings were instituted which
are now brought here on this appeal. On that day, the present appellees, The Maxwell Land-Grant and Railway Company
(to whom by mesne conveyances a large portion of the land
had, in the mean time, been assigned), together with Lucien B.

Maxwell and his wife, filed in the same court a bill against
Guadalupe Thompson, administratrix of Alfred Bent's estate,
her husband, George Thompson, and the said infant children
and heirs of Alfred Bent, in which bill, after setting forth the
grant to Beaubien and Miranda, and the derivative title of the
complainants in the land, and the substance of the proceedings
which had taken place in the previous suit, the complainants
proceeded to state at large the terms of the compromise agreement which had been made, and which had resulted in the
final decree made in that suit. They alleged that this compromise was agreed upon in the lifetime of Alfred Bent, though
not carried out until after his death, and that its terms were
that Lucien B. Maxwell should pay to the complainants in the
original suit $18,000, or $6,000 apiece; and that, in consideration thereof, Alfred Bent and his two sisters should release and
discharge the premises and every part thereof; and the said
Maxwell' and wife, from the said trust or equitable claim, and,
in confirmation thereof, should convey to Maxwell all their
right, title, and interest in and to the premises. The bill
further alleged that the said $18,000 was duly paid (the sum

Oct. 1877.]

THOMPSON v. MAXWELL.

of $6,000 due to Alfred being paid to his wife as administratrix of her husband's estate, and not as guardian of his children); and that the sisters of Alfred, with their husbands,
executed conveyances in accordance with the compromise
agreement, in May, 1866, and that Guadalupe Bent, by a
deed of conveyance executed by her as guardian aforesaid,
undertook to convey the interest of the children as before
stated; and that by said compromise and conveyances the said
trust became extinguished, and the title of Maxwell became
freed and discharged therefrom. The bill then set forth certain errors, which it was alleged had been committed in the
original proceedings, and which cast a cloud upon the title of
the complainants, namely: -First,that it did not appear therein
(as the fact was) that an agreement for the sale of the equitable interest of Alfred Bent was made by him, in his lifetime,
with said Maxwell; secondly, that the interlocutory decree
(of May, 1865) should not have been set aside, but should
have been modified; t irdly, that the money paid by Maxwell
for the interest of Alfred Bent should have been directed to be
paid to his personal representative, and not to the guardian ad
litem of his children; and, fourthly, that, upon such payment
being made, the court should have decreed and adjudged the
said trust and equitable claim or interest to be extinguished,
and that the premises should be held free and discharged of
said trust. The bill then prayed for a decree that the trust
be terminated and extinguished; that the defendants have no
interest or title in the premises, equitable or otherwise ; that
the plaintiffs hold them free and discharged of all trusts in
favor of the defendants and all claiming under them; and for
other and further relief. This bill being demurred to, the
complainants were allowed to amend it by adding a prayer in
the following words: "That for the aforesaid errors of law,
apparent on the face of the said decree of 10th September,
1866, the same may be reviewed and reversed in the points
herein complained of."
It is manifest that the object of this bill, especially after
being amended, was to set aside the decree made in the original
cause, and to substitute therefor a new decree supposed to be
more advantageous to the complainants, upon the same matters

THOMPSON V. MAXWELL.

[Sup. Or.

which were before the court and under its consideration in the
said cause. Under the guise of a bill for quieting title it was
in reality a bill of review.
The defendants, after the appointment of a guardian ad litem
for the infants, answered the bill. Guadalupe Thompson and
her husband denied that an agreement for a compromise was
ever made by Alfred Bent in his lifetime; but they substantially admitted the other facts stated in the bill; alleging, however, that Guadalupe, although she executed the deed of May,
1866, in good faith, was wholly ignorant of the rights of her
children. The guardian ad litem for the infants simply referred
their rights to the court.
Upon these pleadings the parties took proofs; and, without
going into the details thereof, it is sufficient to say, that, in our
judgment, the complainants entirely failed to substantiate the
main fact relied upon by them, namely; that the agreement for
a compromise was concluded with Alfred Bent in his lifetime.
The effect of the evidence appears to be, that, although negotiations were commenced before his death, no agreement was coneluded until after that event, when it was concluded by his
brother-in-law, Scheurick, and was acquiesced in by the other
parties, including the widow of Alfred, acting in behalf of her
children.
Upon the case as thus made, the court, in September Term,
1873, made a decree to the following effect; namely, First, That the decree of Sept. 10, 1866, was erroneous, and
should be reversed, in so far as it set aside the provisions of the
interlocutory decree of May 29, 1865, determining Charles
Bent's interest in the land, and the right of his children to succeed thereto, and directing Guadalupe Bent, the widow of
Alfred, as guardian ad litem for his minor children, to make a
deed of conveyance of all their right, title, and interest in the
said land.
Secondly, The court found and declared, that, after the death
of Alfred Bent, and pending the original suit, an agreement
by way of compromise was made by the adult parties thereto,
for settlement of the same, and that the terms thereof were
considered advantageous to the infants, and were accepted by
the court on their behalf, 'as evinced by the decree attempting

Out. 1877.]

THOMPSON V. MAXWELL.

to carry it out; also, that Maxwell had paid the money stipulated for in the compromise, and that the infants' share had
been received by their mother for their benefit, whereby their
right to the land became extinguished, and the land became
discharged from the trust: therefore, it was decreed that the
Maxwell Land-Grant and Railway Company held the land free
and discharged of said trust.
The defendants appealed from this decree to the Supreme
Court of the Territory, where it was affirmed; and from thence
it was appealed to this court, and the question before us is as
to the validity of these proceedings in the last suit.
If the bill is to be regarded as a bill of review (and in its
ultimate aspect, at least, it seems impossible to regard it otherwise), the proceedings are clearly objectionable, on the following grounds: First, The decree sought to be set aside and reversed was
a consent decree. It is a general rule that against such a decree a bill of review will not lie. W5bb v. Webb, 3 Swanst. 658;
2 Smith Ch. Pr. 50; 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. 1629 (3d Am. ed.).
Secondly, The bill is filed by and on behalf of an assignee
of the original defendant, namely, The Maxwell Land-Grant
and Railway Company; whilst another rule, relating to bills of
review, is, that none but parties and privies can have a bill of
review. It does not lie for assignees. Gilbert. For. Rom. 186,
2 Smith Ch. Pr. 49; 2 Dan. Ch. Pr. 1627. The fact that
'Lucien B. Maxwell and his wife are joined as complainants
does not obviate the difficulty.
Thirdly, The bill seeks a reversal and modification of the
decree upon an alleged matter of fact not appearing upon the
record; namely, that the compromise agreement was made with
Alfred Bent in his lifetime, without alleging any newly discovered evidence unknown to the parties before the decree.
We decided, in the case of Buffington v. Harvey, spra, p. 99
(what was well settled before), that the only questions open
in a bill of review (except when filed on the ground of newly
discovered evidence) are such as arise upon the face of the
record, without reference to the evidence in the cause. Wizting v. Bank of the United States, 13 Pet. 6; Putnam v. Day,
22 Wall. 60.

THOMPSON V. MAXWELL.

[Sup. ota

The case, it is true, is somewhat anomalous. The decree
sought to be set aside by the bill of review was not made in
pursuance of the relief sought by the bill in the original cause,
and was not based upon the pleadings and evidence therein.
It was a decree for confirming and carrying out a settlement
of the controversy, which had produced a change of interest.
The original suit was instituted by the heirs of Charles Bent,
to establish an equitable interest in an undivided share of the
lands, and for a partition thereof. A decree was made establishing the right, ordering the partition, and appointing commissioners to make it. This was as far as the suit progressed.
It was then settled, and the decree in question was entered by
consent, setting aside the decree for partition, and carrying out
the settlement. The bill of review alleges the fact to have
been that the settlement was made by Alfred Bent in his lifetime, and that the decree ought not to have set aside the former
decree establishing his rights, and ought not to have directed
the guardian of his infant heirs to execute a conveyance; but
ought to have declared the land discharged from the trust, upon
payment by Maxwell of the agreed consideration to Alfred's
personal representatives. In other words, the bill of review
insists that the decree was misconceived and erroneous, in view
of the state of facts out of which it grew, and which did not
appear in the record of the cause.
We do not think that the peculiarity of the case, however,
takes it out of the ordinary rules that apply to a bill of review.
A decree for carrying out a settlement and compromise of a
suit is certainly not, of itself, erroneous. When made by consent, it is presumed to be made in view of the existing facts,
and that these were in the knowledge of the parties. In the
absence of fraud in obtaining it, such a decree cannot be impeached.
We have looked into the laws of New Mexico, to see whether
there is any thing peculiar in the modes of proceeding there
which would sustain the bill in its present form; but we have
failed to find any thing of the kind. In civil cases, those
laws adopt the civil-law mode of practice, subject to the regu
lation of the Supreme Court of the Territory. Compiled Laws,
pp. 195, 196. That court has made separate regulations for

Oct. 1877.]

THOmPSON V. MAXWELL.

common-law and equity practice. The rules in relation to
the latter are not materially different from those adopted
by this court for equity cases in the circuit courts. The
civil procedure as pursued in the Spanish courts has no proceeding analogous to a bill of review, except the allegation
of nullity, which must be made within sixty days from the
time of pronouncing the decree; after which period, if no appeal be taken, the sentence or decree becomes res adjudicata,
and cannot be revoked unless obtained by means of false or
forged proofs. 1 White's Recopilacion, 305, 306, from Aso &
Manuel's Institutes, lib. 3, tit. 8, c. 1; Escriche's Diccion, tit.
Sentencia Nula.
Tested, therefore, by any law of procedure which may be
invoked in its support, the bill in this case, considered as a bill
of review, seeking to reverse, modify, and reconstruct the decree of September, 1866, cannot be sustained. Nevertheless, the
general purpose which it evidently had in view- the quieting of the title to the land in question -is one towards which
a court of equity is always liberally disposed, as tending to
promote the peace of society and the security of property. And
if,
instead of seeking to reverse the decree of September, 1866
(which, for like reasons of public policy, as applicable to the
security of judgments that have passed into rem adjudicatam,
is not allowable), the bill had sought to carry that decree more
effectually into execution, it would have been free from legal
objections, and equally conducive to the object in view. Bills
for the purpose named are well known in equity proceedings.
Lord Redesdale says: "Sometimes, from the neglect of parties, or some other cause, it
becomes impossible to carry a decree into execution without the
further decree of the court. This happens, generally, in cases where
parties having neglected to proceed upon the decree, their rights
under it become so embarrassed by a variety of subsequent events
that it is necessary to have the decree of the court to settle and ascertain them. Sometimes such a bill is exhibited by a person who
was not a party to the original decree, but claims a similar interest,
or is unable to obtain the determination of his own right till the
decree is carried into execution. Or it may be brought by or against
a person claiming as assignee of a party to the decree. The court

THOMPSON V. MAXWELL.

[Sup. Ct.

in these cases in general only enforces, and does not vary, the
decree; but on circumstances it has sometimes considered the
directions, and varied them in case of mistake; and it has even on
circumstances refused to enforce the decree; though in other cases
the court, and the House of Lords upon an appeal, seem to have
considered that the law of the decree ought not to be examined on
a bill to carry it into execution.' Redesdale's Treatise, 95, 96.
It seems to us that the remedy here described by such high
authority is applicable to the case at bar. The decree of
September, 1866, has never been carried into effect by any act
done since it was made. It directed that Maxwell should pay
the money stipulated for by the compromise, and that the defendant should execute deeds of conveyance. But the parties
seem to have assumed that their previous acts performed in
May, 1866, were a sufficient compliance with the directions of
the decree. Yet the decree does not take notice of this fact.
Now, in order to execute this decree, or to determine whether
it has or has not been substantially executed, and to determine
an d declare the effect of such execution upon the rights of all
concerned, and thus remove any cloud from the title arising
from the imperfection of the proceedings, it was perfectly competent for the parties to file a bill conceived and constructed
to that end. The bill in this case, as originally filed, before
it was converted by amendment into a bill of review, and abating the allegations of error in the original decree, approximated
to the character of such a bill as might have been sustained. The
proofs show a case which, in our judgment, supports the conclusions of the decree, to the effect that the terms of compromise made by the adult parties to the suit (including the mother
and guardian of the infant heirs of Alfred Bent) were advantageous to the said infants, and were so considered and accepted
by the court in their behalf. But, so far as the present decree
undertook to reverse and modify the decree of September, 1866,
we think it is clearly erroneous. Still, although we feel obliged
to reverse the present decree, we do not think that the bill
should be absolutely dismissed. And, as the whole question
between the parties has been fully litigated on the proofs, it
would be unreasonable to require that these should be taken
over again.

Our conclusion is, that the present decree must be reversed

with directions to allow the complainants to amend their bill
as they shall be advised, and with liberty to the defendants to

BiPIGEs v. SPEruY.
1. Where the record shows that a suit brought in a State court was, on the petttion of the defendant, and by reason of the character of the parties, duly
removed to the proper Circuit Court of the United States, the jurisdiction
of the latter court is not lost for want of an averment of citizenship in the
bill of complaint originally filed, or in the amendments thereto, which were
made in the Circuit Court.
2. The bill in this case prayed for a dissolution of the partnership between the
parties, and a sale of certain lands by them held as tenants in common,
which, it was alleged, were not susceptible of division without prejudice to
them. There was no demurrer to the bill, nor did the answer raise any
objection to the jurisdiction. Held, 1. That, as the allegations of the bill
touching the lands conform to the provision of the Code of California,
and are sustained by the proofs, the decree below awarding partition was
proper. 2. That, if there is any thing in the allegations which concern the
partnership, which introduces another matter, the objection should have
been taken by demurrer for multifariousness.
