ALEXANDRIA V. FAIRFAX.

[Sup. Ct.

Company, a tax exceeding the rate of one-half of one per cent
of the valuation of the taxable property; and the return to the
alternative writ avers, that, for the year 1874, a county tax of
one-half of one per cent had been fully levied and collected.
If this was so, and the demurrer admits it, the county court
was in no default in this particular; and as the petition for the
mandamus was presented in 1874, before any default in levying a tax, a more favorable judgment on the demurrer could
not have been given for the relator than the court gave.
In thus deciding, we are not to be understood as maintaining
all that is averred in the defendants' return to the alternative
writ. We do not assert that the relator is without remedy
against the county, or that his remedy is restricted to a resort
to the proceeds of the special tax. It is enough for this case
that the judgment of the Circuit Court was correct on the
pleadings.
Judgment affirmed.

v. FAiRAX.

1. Every corporation has officers, who speak and act for it by authority of
law; and some one of them, either by an express statutory provision, or by
the nature of his functions, is the proper person on whom the process
or notice, which is necessary to bind it in a judicial proceeding, must be
served.
2. Where the proceeding to confiscate a debt of tle corporation to an individual
is, by reason of his absence beyond the jurisdiction, necessarily in rem, the
service of the process or notice on the corporation, which is requisite to a
valid seizure of the debt, should be made upon some one of the officers of
the corporation on whom a similar service would bind it in an ordinary suit
against it.
3. By the Code of Virginia, such service, in case of a town or a city, may be made
on the mayor, or, in his absence, on the president of the council or board of
trustees, or, if both be absent, on an alderman or trustee.
4. Service on the auditor of Alexandria, without an appearance by the city or
the creditor, did not give the court jurisdiction of the debt which the city
owed the creditor; and its decree condemning the debt to confiscation and
sale is void.

The defence was that the stock whereof mention is made in
the bonds or certificates, and all the right, title, and interest of
Fairfax therein, had, with the accrued interest thereon, been
condemned to confiscation and sale, under an act of Congress
of July, 1862, by a decree of the District Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Virginia, May 4, 1864, and sold
by the marshal, who transferred the stock to the purchasers on
the books of the auditor of the city. The council recognized
this transfer as valid, and issued to the purchasers or their
assigns certificates of stock of like tenor and effect. They are
still outstanding, and the interest thereon has been paid to the
holders of them.
Fairfax was a resident of Alexandria, until the commencement of the rebellion. He then went to Richmond, Va.,
where he has since resided, taking with him the said bonds or
certificates of indebtedness, and he retained possession of them
until he brought this suit.
The present controversy turned on the jurisdiction of the
District Court. Neither Fairfax nor the city council entered

MR. JuSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the court.
Orlando Fairfax, a resident of the city of Alexandria, Va.,
previous to the outbreak of the late civil war, was the owner
of about $8,700 of the obligations of said city, which were in
the form of bonds, not negotiable on their face, bearing interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, payable semiannually,
and having several years to run, and transferable on the books
of the corporation. These obligations were called stock of the
city of Alexandria. At the beginning of the war, Fairfax left
Alexandria, and joined the Confederates at the city of Richmond, and did not return until the war was over.
During his absence, proceedings were instituted to confiscate
this stock, and prosecuted to a decree and sale. The marshal
made a transfer of it to the purchaser, who received the interest regularly until Fairfax commenced the present suit against
the city to recover the interest so paid, and establish his right
to the stock.
The Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia rendered judgment in his favor, and the city sued out this writ of error.

ALEXANDRIA V. FAIRFAX.

The single question which we shall consider is, whether there
was such a seizure of this stock, or of Fairfax's interest in the
debt which the uity owed him, as gave to the District Court
of the United States jurisdiction to confiscate and sell it under
the at of Congress on that subject.
All that was done in the way of seizure appears in the following paper issued by the district attorney of the United States
to the marshal of the district, and the marshal's return, indorsed on it:"OrvFcE

ALEXANDRIA v. FAIRFAX.

[Sup. Ct.

In the present suit, it is among the facts agreed to by both
parties, and signed by their counsel as part of the record, that
these bonds or certificates of stock were carried by Fairfax to
Richmond, and remained in his personal possession during the
war. It is, therefore, clear that the marshal made no manual
seizure of them, and did not mean to say so by his return, unless
he intended to make a false return. It is a fair and reasonable inference from the return and the agreed facts in this case,
that what he actually did to constitute a seizure, and what he understood to constitute the seizure of this stock, was "notice to
R. Johnson, auditor of the corporation of Alexandria." The
words "as within directed" turn our attention to the order of
the district attorney, under which the marshal acted. It will
be there seen that he was directed to seize the interest of Fairfax in eighty-seven shares of the stock of the corporation of
Alexandria, with all the moneys due him and becoming due
on said stock, together with all improvements, buildings, &c.,
to the same belonging. If any buildings were seized as "part
of the within-described property," in the language of the marshal's return, nothing has ever been heard of it since. The
order was, in legal effect, to attach the interest of Fairfax in
this stock.
We are of opinion that Hiller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268,
and Tler v. Defrees, id. 331, establish the proposition that a
valid -.eizure or attachment of this stock, or his interest in it,
under the order of the district attorney, is a sufficient seizure
to give the court jurisdiction, provided the order and the marshal's at tion under it are returned into court as the foundation
for proceedings under the libel. But no more can be claimed for
what was done as a seizure, or intended as a seizure, than if
the order had bea.u a writ under the seal of the court.
We are comprtled, then, to inquire whether the simple statement of the D'itshal, that he had given notice to R. Johnson,
auditor of the city, was a sufficient seizure, in face of the conceded fact that he had made no actual or manual seizure of
any thing, to give jurisdiction. In determining what it was
of which Johnson had notice, it is perhaps fair to infer that
the marshal read to him the paper issued by the district attorney. He then had notice that the United States govern-

ment was aware of the existence of the stock or bonds which
Fairfax owned; in other words, that the city was indebted to
Fairfax, and that proceedings were in this manner initiated for
the confiscation of that indebtedness. There can be no doubt
that the statute authorized the confiscation of the credits of one
who came within its provisions. We have as little doubt that
these stocks were credits within its meaning. It is clear that
there was a mode of reaching them under the act of Congress,
notwithstanding the evidences of Fairfax's right to them were
in his pocket, and beyond the reach of the process of the court.
If the debt due him had been by an individual, there would
have been no difficulty in serving such a process or notice on
the debtor as would have subjected him to the orders of the
court in regard to it. If Johnson, as an individual, had owed
the debt to Fairfax, it is probable that the notice served on
him would have been sufficient.
But an incorporated city is not an individual, and setvice of
notice or process on one of its citizens is not service on it. It
has its officers, who speak and act for it by authority of law;
and some one of these officers, either by an express statutory
provision, or by the nature of their functions, is the proper
person on whom all notices and processes necessary to bind it
by judicial proceedings must be served.
It would seem to be reasonable that in proceedings in rem
to confiscate property in the absence of its owner, where the
seizure of it is a sine qua non to the jurisdiction of the court,
and where, as in the present case, actual manucaption is impossible, the evidence which supports a constructive seizure should
be scrutinized as closely, and be of a character as satisfactory,
as that which would subject the party holding the fund or
owing the debt which is the object of the proceedings to an
ordinary civil suit in the same court. If this be a correct view
of the subject, and we think it is quite as favorable to the validity of the judgment of confiscation as can be maintained on
sound principle, it is necessary to inquire if service of process
on the auditor would authorize a judgment by default against
the city in an ordinary action. We are not informed by any
thing in this record, or in the brief, of the nature of his functions. We have no reason to believe that it is any part of his

ALEXANDRIA V. FAIRFAX.

[Sup. Ct.

duty to defend actions at law against the city, or to employ
counsel for that purpose, or that he had any authority to do
so. The word used to describe his office does not imply that,
as treasurer, he had in his possession the money or other property of the city. He was not even bound to make record of
matters done by or affecting the corporation, as the clerk or
secretary of the governing body would be. He was not,
probably, a member of the board of councilmen or aldermen,
-who governed the city, and whose duty it would have been to
protect her in such a matter as this.
But we are relieved from any difficulty on this subject by
the statute of Virginia, which prescribes, as every law should
do under which corporations are organized, the mode of serving process or notice on them. It points out the officers of the
corporation on whom such process or notice may be served,
and is so liberal in providing for service as to leave no excuse
for departing from it by a service on any one else. "It shall
be sufficient to serve any process against or notice to a corporation on its mayor, rector, president, or other chief officer, or,
in his absence from the county or corporation 'in which he
resides, or in which is the principal office of the corporation
against or to which the process or notice is, if it be a city or
town, on the president of the council or board of trustees, or
in his absence, on the recorder, or any alderman or trustee."
Code of Virginia of 1860, p. 707, c. 170, sect. 7.
It appears from these bonds or certificates of debt that there
was a mayor of the city. On him, if in the city, the law
required service to be made. There is no return that he was
absent, nor is any reason given why service was not made on
him. There were, as it appears, a council, and a president of
that council, and he is specially named in the statute as an officer on whom service may be made. No reason is given why
service was not made on him.
But if, against all sound principle, we could indulge in presumptions in favor of this jurisdiction, and suppose that both
these officers were absent, notice should have been served on
an alderman or councilman, since it appears that there were
such officers.
We are not informed whether there was a recorder of that

781

city. If there was, he was not served. But, by a strange inadvertence, almost the only officer not mentioned in the statute
as one on whom the service may be made is the one selected,
while all those are omitted whom the law specifically points
out as the proper ones; and for the failure to serve them no
reason is given.
In the absence of any appearance by Fairfax or by the city
in a case where the proceedings against the debtor and the
owner of the debt are wholly ex parte and by default, and in
the absence of actual seizure of any tangible evidence of the
debt, we are of opinion that no jurisdiction of that debt was
acquired by the notice to the auditor, and on this alone it is
supposed to rest.
As in this point we concur with the Court of Appeals of
Virginia, its judgment is
Affirmed.
MR. CHIF JUsTIcE WAITE concurred in the judgment.
