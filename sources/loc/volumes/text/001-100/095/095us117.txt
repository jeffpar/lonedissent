INSURANCE Co. v. BOON.

But of the existence of the present contract there is no doubt.
Its meaning and its terms are clear enough, and, taken alone,
no one denies but that it is a contract which would be protected
by the Constitution of the United States. The implication is
of a right to revoke it, and comes from the other quarter, and
is one which we do not think exists by fair construction, and
which we do not feel at liberty to import into the contract to
defeat its manifest purpose.
Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.
M-u. JUSTICE BRADLFY took no part in the consideration of

this case.

8. A policy of insurance for one year, issued Sept. 2, 1864, upon certain goods
then in a store at the city of Glasgow, Mo., contained the following stipulation : "Provided always, and it is hereby declared, that the company shall
not be liable to make good any loss or damage by fire which may happen or
take place by means of any invasion, insurrection, riot, or civil commotion,
or of any military or usurped power." At an early hour on the morning of
the fifteenth day of October, 1864, an armed force of the rebels, under military organization, surrounded and attacked the city. It was defended by
Colonel Harding and the forces of the United States under his command,
and a battle between them and the rebel forces continued for many hours.
When it became apparent to Colonel Harding that the city could not be
successfully defended, he. in order to prevent the military stores deposited
in the city hall from falling into the possession of the rebel forces, set
fire to the city hall. It, with its contents, was consumed. Without other
interference, agency, or instrumentality, the fire spread to the building
next adjacent to the city hall, and from building to building through two
other intermediate buildings to the store containing the goods insured, and

INSURANCE CO. v. BOON.

[Sup. Ct.

destroyed them. During this time, and until after the fire had consumed
such goods, the battle continued, and no surrender had taken place, nor had
the rebel forces, nor any part thereof, entered the city. Held, that the fire
which destroyed the goods was excepted from the risk undertaken by the
insurers.
ERROIP to the Circuit Court of the United States for the

District of Connecticut.
This was an action commenced in September, 1868, to
recover $6,000, the amount of a policy of insurance, bearing date Sept. 2, 1864, issued to the plaintiffs below by the
,Etna Fire Insurance Company of Hartford, Conn., for one
year, upon certain goods, wares, and merchandise then in their
store at Glasgow, Mo., which were destroyed by fire Oct. 15,
1864.
By written stipulation, a jury was waived, and the issues of
fact tried by the court.
On April 28, 1874, the court filed a written opinion declaring
their finding of facts upon the evidence, with their conclusions
of law thereon, and rendered judgment accordingly for the
plaintiffs. No other findings of fact were had, nor was a bill of
exceptions tendered at that time. On the 13th of July following,
the defendant applied to the circuit judge in vacation for a rule
on the plaintiffs to show cause why the findings of fact and the
conclusions of law thereon should not be stated by the court,
and a bill of exceptions signed and filed nune pro tune. Leave
for that purpose having been granted, execution of the judgment was stayed. August 22, the parties stipulated in writing
that the rule should be heard before the district judge at chambers. Upon the hearing, he, on the twenty-fourth day of that
month, granted the rule. At the September Term of the court,
the findings of fact and conclusions of law thereon were duly
entered nune pro tune as of the April Term, and the bill of
exceptions was signed by both judges. The findings, so far
as they involve any question argued by counsel here, are as
follows: "That the policy, which was duly executed by the defendant and
delivered to the plaintiffs, contained the following express provisions, annexed to the agreement of insurance and in the body of
the policy, namely:"_Provided always, and it is hereby declared, that the company
shall not be liable to make good any loss or damage by fire which

INSURANCE

Co. v. BooN.

may happen or take place by means of any invasion, insurrection,
riot, or civil commotion, or of any military or usurped power, or
any loss by theft at or after a fire."
That the facts and circumstances showing the cause of the
fire are as follows, namely: At and before the time of the fire
in question, the city of Glasgow, within which the said store of
the plaintiffs was situated, was occupied as *a military post of
the United States, by the military forces and a portion of the
army of the United States engaged in the civil war then, and
for more than three years theretofore, prevailing between the
government and the citizens of several Southern States who
were in rebellion and seeking to establish an independent government, under the name of the Confederate States of America.
As such military post, the said city of Glasgow was made the
place of deposit of military stores for the use of the army of
the. United States, which stores were in a building called the
city hall of the said city of Glasgow, situated on the same
street, on the same side of the street, and about one hundred
and fifty feet distant from the plaintiffs' said store, three
buildings, nevertheless, being located in the intervening space,
not, however, in actual contact with either. Colonel Chestei
Harding, an officer of the United States government, and in
command of the military forces of the United States, held the
possession of the said city, and had lawful charge and control
of the military stores aforesaid. On the fifteenth day of October,
1864, an armed force of the rebels, under military organization,
surrounded and attacked the city at an early hour in the morning, and threw shot and shell into the town, penetrating some
buildings, and one thereof penetrating the said store of the
plaintiffs, but without setting fire thereto or causing any fire
therein, and some of said shell killing soldiers and citizens.
The city was defended by Colonel Harding and the military
forces under his command, and battle between the loyal troops
and the rebel forces continued for many hours. The citizens
fled to places of security, and no civil government prevailed in
the city. The rebel forces were superior in numbers, and, after
a battle of several hours, drove the forces of the government
from their position, compelled their surrender, and entered and
occupied the city.

INSURANCE

Co. v. BooN.

[Sup. Ct.

During the battle, and when the government troops had
been driven from their exterior lines of defence, it becameapparent to Colonel Harding that the city could not be successfully defended, and he thereupon, in order to prevent the said
military stores from falling into the possession of the said rebel
forces, ordered Major Moore, one of the officers under his command, to destroy them.
In obedience to this order to destroy the said stores, and having no other means of doing so, Major Moore set fire to the said
city hall, and thereby the said building, with its contents, was
consumed. Without other interference, agency, or instrumentality, the fire spread along the line of the street aforesaid to
the building next adjacent to the city hall, and from building
to building through two other intermediate buildings to the
store of the plaintiffs, and destroyed the same, together with
its contents, including the goods insured by the defendant's
policy aforesaid. During this time, and until after the fire
had consumed such goods, the battle continued, and no surrender had taken place, nor had the forces of the rebels, nor
any part thereof, obtained the possession of or entered the
city.
It was conceded that the order of Colonel Harding was, in
the exigency, a lawful and discreet use of the military authority vested in him.
The court declared, as conclusions of law upon the facts
found, that the defendant was not exempted by virtue of the
said proviso from liability to the plaintiffs under said policy,
and that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment for $6,000,
the value of the property destroyed, with interest thereon from
July 1, 1865, and costs of suit.
On the 7th of October, 1874, the defendant sued out this writ
of error.

of the judgment below.
The record presents no question which can be reviewed here,
as the court below had no jurisdiction of the cause after the
close of the term at which the judgment was rendered. Sheppard v. Wilson, 6 How. 275; Turner v. Yeates, 16 id. 14; Walton v. United States, 9 Wheat. 657; Huller v. -Ehlers,91 U. S.

352; Insurance Company v. Tweed, 7 Wall. 44; Welts v. Conn.
JutualLife Insurance Co., 48 N. Y. 34; and that is the cause
next preceding the effect, and capable of producing it. In this
case, this cause was clearly the act of Colonel Harding in setting fire to the city hall; and no other cause "intervened between this act and the fact accomplished." Invaders, persons
in insurrection, riot, or civil commotion, did not set the fire,
nor have any part in the destruction of the insured property.
The destruction was adverse to their interest. They took the
town, but destroyed nothing.
The so-called military necessity is not named in the contract
as a cause of exception. Besides, it bad, in itself, no causal
power. Furnishing a motive for, and in this sense an antecedent to, the act of Colonel Harding, it had nothing to do
with causation.
His act was not that of a military or usurped power. Power,
in itself, means simply power, not lawful authority. Military
power is not lawful military authority, but rests upon mere
force of arms, and must, therefore, of necessity be usurped.
The word "or" in the proviso of the policy is used as conjunctive, not as disjunctive. It means both military and
usurped. It is used to express equivalents. Thus, the exceptions signify that any loss happening by means of any military
power, or, which is the same thing, of any usurped power, shall
be excepted. Or is often so used. Thus we say a thing is a
square, or a figure under four equal sides and angles. And
the policy says, loss or damage, goods or merchandise, happen
or take place, military or usurped.
This construction is sustained by the implied antithesis.
Military has its antithesis in civil; military power, in civil
power.

INSURANCE

Co. v.

BOON.

[Sup, O .

The words "military or usurped power" were first introduced into policies of insurance in Great Britain soon after
the Rebellion of 1715. They referred to the power of the
Pretender, and not to any lawful military authority or power
of the realm. Ellis, Ins. 41; Park, Ins. 657; Marsh. Ins. 791.
Prior to that time, the exceptions were "fire occasioned by
invasion and foreign enemy." The framers of them seem to
have considered either invasion or foreign enemy as a military power, and then, lest they might not be comprehensive
enough to embrace domestic rebels, like the Pretenders and
their followers, "any military or usurped power whatsoever"
was added. Manifestly, "military" and "usurped" were synonymous. 1 Bell, Com. 672. The courts of Great Britain
and of this country treat them as signifying rebellion conducted by authority. .Drinkwater v. The London Assurance
Co., 2 Wilson, 863; Langdale v. fason, 2 Marsh. Ins. 791;
City Fire Insurance Co. v. Corlies, 21 Wend. (N. Y.) 867;
Sprull v. North Carolina Mut. Life Insurance Co., 1 Jones
(N. C.), 126; Harris v. York Insurance Co., 50 Penn. 841.
And the parties to the contract are bound by the settled judicial
construction of the words. City Fire Insurance Co. v. Corlies,
supra.
The maxim noscitur a sociis furnishes, in this case, the
true rule of interpretation. Every other -cause of exception
named in the proviso, "invasion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion," being unlawful, the words "military power," in the
same category, signify an unlawful military power, not the
lawful military authority of the country. This observation
derives especial force from the fact that "military" stands
here in such close fellowship with "usurped." Military or
usurped is the expression. Breasted v. The Farmers'Loan J
Trust Co., 8 N. Y. 304; Harper's Adm'rs v. _Phcenix Insurance
Co., 19 Mo. 506; Cluff v. Mut. Benefit Life Insurance Co.,
13 Allen (Mass.), 308.
The act of Colonel Harding, so far from being the act of a
military or usurped power, was an act of civil jurisdiction,
whereby he asserted, in behalf of the nation, their paramount
title to the property, by virtue of. the right of eminent domain. Jitchell v. Harmony, 13 How. 113; Grant v. United

States, 1 Ct. Cl. p. 41; WTggin's Case, 3 id. p. 412; Harris v.
York Insurance Co., 50 Penn. 341.
This, however, does not exempt the insurers from liability.
But, on paying the loss, they are substituted to the rights of
the insured.
If the destruction of the goods was not the intended consequence of the act of Colonel Harding, and, therefore, not a taking of private property for public use, but -was accidental, it
was one of those accidents the peril of which the insurers
assumed. It was not thereby converted into the act of rebels,
nor did it, therefore, happen by means of invasion, insurrection,
riot, civil commotion, or of any military or usurped power
The underwriters made their own exceptions, and the onus
of proving the loss to be within the exceptions is on them. If,
therefore, there is any ambiguity in the words employed, or
any doubt as to the loss being within the exceptions, the principle of fortius contraproferentem furnishes the rule.
The obvious natural import of the words employed designates
plainly the unlawful character of the causes excepted; the
history of their first introduction into policies of insurance
shows the nature of the risks intended to be excluded; and the
subsequent adjudications of the meaning of the words render
it certain that the words "military or usurped power" have
no reference to acts of constitutional sovereignty, but are limited
to acts of rebellion. The act of Colonel Harding, which caused
the loss, was not an act of rebellion. The loss was not, therefore, excepted by the proviso.
Mr. C. W. Parsons and Mr. B. D. Hubbard, contra.
MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of the court.
Preliminary to any consideration of the assignments of error
is the question whether the bill of exceptions and the special
finding of facts can be considered as a part of the record. The
issues formed by the pleadings were tried by the court, without
the intervention of a jury, in September, 1873, and judgment
for the plaintiffs was ordered at April Term, 1874. It does not
appear that any exceptions were taken to the rulings of the
court during the progress of the trial, and that which is now
claimed to be a bill of exceptions has no reference to any such

INSURANCE Co

v. BOON.

[Sup. Ct

rulings. It relates only to the judgment given on the findings
of the issues of fact. The act of Congress which authorizes
trials by the court, 13 Stat. 500, sects. 649, 700, Rev. Stats.,
has enacted that the finding of the court upon the facts, which
may be either general or special, shall have the same effect as
the verdict of a jury; and that, when the finding is special, the
review by the Supreme Court upon a writ of error may extend
to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts found to
support'the judgment. No bill of exceptions is required, or is
necessary, to bring upon the record the findings, whether general or special. They belong to the record as fully as do the
verdicts of a jury. If the finding be special, it takes the place
of a special verdict; and, when judgment is entered upon it, no
bill of exceptions is needed to bring the sufficiency of the finding up for review. But there must be a finding of facts, either
general or special, in order to authorize a judgment; and that
finding must appear on the record. In this case, there was no
formal finding of facts when the judgment was ordered. It is
to be inferred, it is true, from the judgment and from the entry
of the clerk, that the issue made by the pleadings was found
for the plaintiffs, but how, whether generally or specially, does
not appear. There was, therefore, a defect in the record, which
it was quite competent for the court to supply by amendment;
and such an amendment was made. After the close of the
April Term, and in the vacation next following, the judge of
the court, on application of the defendants, granted an order
upon the plaintiffs to show cause why the defendants should
not have leave inter alia to make and serve a case or bill of
exceptions, containing the evidence given at the trial, special
findings of fact and law, and such exceptions thereto as the
defendants might desire to make, and why such case or bill of
exceptions when made and settled should not be filed, nune pro
tune, as of the term when the judgment was entered. Upon
this rule both parties were heard; and the result was an order
that "a finding of facts in the cause, with the conclusions
of the court thereupon, conformably to the opinion of the court
theretofore filed," be prepared, to be approved by the court at
the next following term (September) ; that the defendants have
leave to prepare a bill of exceptions to be allowed and signed

Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE

Co. v. BooN.

at said term, and that "said special finding of facts" and bill
of exceptions should be made, allowed, and entered of record,
vune pro tune, as of the April Term, 1874, of the court. Such
a special finding was accordingly prepared, and at the September Term signed by both the judges of the Circuit Court,
the order made in vacation was made the order of the court,
and the separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with the bill of exceptions, also signed, were ordered to
be filed, nune pro tune, as of April Term, 1874, and made part
of the record of the cause. Had the court power to make such
an order respecting a special finding, and, if it had, does the
order have the effect of making the special finding a part of
the record? It is not necessary to inquire whether the court,
at a term subsequent to the judgment, could lawfully allow and
sign a bill of exceptions not noted at the trial. It may be
admitted that a court has no such power; but, as already remarked, no bill of exceptions was needed to bring any thing
upon the record. If the special finding of facts was properly
there, or was rightfully supplied, the judgment of the court is
subject to review independently of any bill of exceptions, the
only office of which is to bring upon the record rulings that
without it would not appear. It remains, therefore, to consider
whether the court could at the September Term, by an order,
correct the record by incorporating into it, nune pro tne, a
special finding of the facts upon which the judgment had been
rendered. It is familiar doctrine that courts always have jurisdiction over their records to make them conform to what was
actually done at the time; and, whatever may have been the
rule announced in some of the old cases, the modern doctrine
is that some orders and amendments may be made at a subsequent term, and directed to be entered and become of record as
of a former term. In Rwaos v. Tie Commonwealth, 35 Penn.
St. 276, Gibson, C. J., said: "The old notion that the record
remains in the breast of the court only till the end of the
term has yielded to necessity, convenience, and common sense.
Countless instances of amendment after the term, but ostensibly
made during it, are to be found in our own books and those of
our neighbors." Even judgments may be corrected in accordance with the truth. It has been held by this court that, at

INSURANCE

Co. v. BooN.

[Sup. Ct.

a subsequent term, when a judgment bad before been arrested,
an amendment may be made to apply the verdict to a good
count, if another be bad, and the minutes of the judge show
that the evidence sustained the good one.
fatheson's Adm'r
v. Grant's Adm'r, 2 How. 282. And this has been repeatedly
held elsewhere. Generally, it may be admitted that judgments
cannot be amended after the term at which they were rendered,
except as to defects or matters of form; but every court of
record has power to amend its records, so as to make them conform to and exhibit the truth. Ordinarily, there must be something to amend by; but that may be the judge's minutes or
notes, not themselves records, or any thing that satisfactorily
shows what the truth was. Within these rules, we think, was
the order made at September Term, that the special finding
of facts and conclusions of law be signed by the judges and
allowed, conformably to the opinion of the court theretofore
filed, and that it, together with the order, should be filed nune
,pro tunc as of April Term, and made part of the record. It
was but an amendment or correction of form, the form of the
finding, not of its substance, and there was enough to amend
by. The opinion, which was filed concurrently with the entry
of the judgment, contained substantially, almost literally, the
same statement of facts, and relied upon it as the foundation
of the judgment given. True, that opinion is no part of the
record, any more than are a judge's minutes; but it was a guide
to the amendment made, and it seems altogether probable it
was intended to be itself a special finding of the facts. The
order of September, 1874, recites that the court had at April
Term filed, announced, and declared their findings of facts, with
their conclusions of law thereupon, which findings and conclusions were embodied in the opinion of the court announced and
filed in the cause. And all that was wanting to make it a sufficient special finding was that it was not entitled "finding of
facts." The amendment or correction, therefore, contradicts
nothing in the record as made at April Term, and it is in strict
accordance with the truth. We conclude, then, that the order
of September Term was within the discretion of the court, and
that by it the special finding returned became a part of the
record of the cause, and that the judgment founded upon

Oct. 1877'.]

INSURANCE

Co. v. BooN.

it is subject to review in this court without any bill of exceptions.
In so holding, we do not depart from any thing we have ever
decided respecting the power of a court to make up a ease, after
the expiration of a term, for bills of exceptions not claimed at
the trial. This is not a case of that kind. It is the case of a
correction of the record, not merely an allowance of exceptions
never taken, and necessary to have been taken, to bring an interlocutory ruling upon it. We hold now, as we have always
holden, that when bills of exceptions are necessary to bring
any matter upon record so that it can be reviewed in error, it
must appear by the record that the exception was taken at the
trial. A judge cannot afterwards allow one not taken in time.
Could he allow it, the record would be made to speak falsely.
Coming, then, to the merits of the case, the main question is,
whether the fire which destroyed the plaintiff's property "bappened or took place by means of any invasion, insurrection, riot,
or civil commotion, or of any military or usurped power." If it
did, the loss was excepted from the risk taken by the insurers.
The policy contains this express stipulation: "Provided
always, and it is hereby declared, that the company shall not
be liable to make good any loss or damage by fire which may
happen or take place by means of any invasion, insurrection,
riot, or civil commotion, or of any military or usurped power,
or any loss by theft at or after a fire." The general purpose
of this proviso is clear enough, but there is controversy respecting the extent of the exemption made by it. It has been very
strenuously argued that the words "military or usurped power"
must be construed as meaning military and usurped power;
that they do not refer to military power of the government,
lawfully exercised, but to usurped military power, either that
exerted by an invading foreign enemy, or by an internal armed
force in rebellion, sufficient to supplant the laws of the land
and displace the constituted authorities. There is, it must be
admitted, considerable authority, and no less reason, in support
of this interpretation. In our view of the present case, however, we are not called upon to affirm positively that such is
the true meaning of the words in the connection in which they
werE used in the policy now under review; for, if it be con-

INSURANCE

Co. v.

BOON.

[Sup. Ct.

ceded that it is, we are still of opinion that the fire which destroyed the premises of the plaintiffs below "happened," "took
place," or occurred by means of a risk excepted in the policy.
In other words, it was caused by invasion, and the usurped
military power of a rebellion against the government of the
United States, as the contracting parties understood the terms
"invasion" and "military or usurped power."
Policies of insurance, like other contracts, must receive a
reasonable interpretation consonant with the apparent object
and plain intent of the parties. This is entirely consistent
with the rule that ambiguities should be construed most
strongly against the underwriters, and most favorably to the
assured. ffIanhattan Insurance 'Co. v. Stein, 5 Bush (Ky.),
652. It was well said recently by the New York Court of
Appeals, that, in construing contracts, words must have the
sense in which the parties understood them. And, to understand them as the parties understood them, the nature of the
contract, the objects to be attained, and all the circumstances
must be considered. Cushman v. United States Life Insurance
Co., 6 Law Jour., p. 601.
Apply, now, these principles to the present case. The policy
was issued in 1864, while the country was convulsed by a civil
war. The property insured was in a State bordering upon sections, the people of which were in insurrection against the
general government, and confederated as a usurping power.
The State had been the theatre of civil commotion and of
armed invasion during the struggle between the confederated
States and the Federal government, a struggle not then ended.
It was quite possible that new invasions might be made and
new destruction of property might be caused by the military
or usurped power then in rebellion. It is evident that the
insurers were willing to assume only ordinary risks, and that,
to guard against more extended liability, the excepting clause
was introduced into the policy. The provision must have been
intended to be a protection to the company against extraordinary risks, attendant upon the condition of things then existing.
Invasion involved, of necessity, resistance by the constituted
authorities of the government, and the employment of its military force. Destruction of property by fire was quite as likely

Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE

Co. v. Boo-N.

to be caused by resistance to the usurping military power as by
the direct action of that power itself. This must have been
foreseen and considered when the insurance was effected. It
is difficult, therefore, to believe that the parties intended to
confine the stipulated exemption within the limits to which
the assured would now confine it. That the destruction of
the plaintiff's property by fire was a consequence of the attack
of the organized rebel military forces upon the forces of the
United States holding possession of Glasgow, the special finding of facts clearly shows. Glasgow was a military post, and
a place of deposit for the military stores of the United States,
which were in the city hall. The city was guarded and defended by a military force under the command of Colonel
Harding.
At an early hour of the morning of the fifteenth day of,
October, 1864, an armed force of the rebels, under military
organization, surrounded and attacked the city and threw shot
and shell into it, penetrating some buildings, and one thereof
penetrating the store of the plaintiffs, but without setting fire
thereto or causing any fire therein, and some of the shell killing soldiers and citizens. The city was defended by Colonel
Harding and the military forces under his command, and a.
battle between the loyal troops and the rebel forces continue&
for many hours. The citizens fled to places of security, and
no civil government prevailed in the city. The rebel forces were
superior in number, and drove the forces of the government
from their position, compelled their surrender, and entered and4
occupied the city.
During the battle, and when the government troops had been
driven from their exterior lines of defence, it became apparent
to Colonel Harding that the city could not be successfully
defended, and he thereupon, in order to prevent the said military stores from falling into the possession of the rebel forces,
ordered Major Moore, one of the officers under his command,
to destroy them.
In obedience to this order to destroy the said stores, and
having no other means of doing so, Major Moore set fire to the
city hall, and thereby the said building, with its contents, was
consumed. Without other interference, agency, or instrumenVOL. V.

[Sup. Ct..

tality, the fire spread along the line of the street aforesaid to the
building next adjacent to the city hall, and from building to
building through two other intermediate buildings to the store
of the plaintiffs, and destroyed the same, together with its contents, including the goods insured by the defendant's policy
aforesaid. During this time, and until after the fire had consumed such goods, the battle continued; and no surrender had
taken place, nor had the forces of the rebels, nor any part
thereof, obtained the possession of or entered the city.
In view of this state of facts found by the court, the inquiry
is, whether the rebel invasion or the usurping military force or
power -was the predominating and operative cause of the fire.
The question is not what cause was nearest in time or place to
the catastrophe. That is not the meaning of the maxim
eausa proxima, non renota spectatur.
The proximate cause is the efficient cause, the one that necessarily sets the other causes in operation. The causes that
are merely incidental or instruments of a superior or controlling agency are not the proximate causes and the responsible
ones, though they may be nearer in time to the result. It
is only when the causes are independent of each other that
the nearest is, of course, to be charged with the disaster. A
careful consideration of the authorities will vindicate this
rule. Mr. Phillips, in his work on Insurance, sect. 1097, in
speaking of a nisi prius case of a vessel burnt by the master
and crew to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy,
Gordon v. Bimmington, 1 Camp. 123, says, the "maxim causa
proxima spectatur affords no help in these cases, but is, in
fact, fallacious; for if two causes conspire, and one must be
chosen, the more scientific inquiry seems to be, whether one is
not the efficient cause, and the other merely instrumental or
merely incidental, and not which is nearer in place or time to
the consummation of the catastrophe." And again, in sect.
1132: "In case of the concurrence of different causes, to one
of which it is necessary to attribute the loss, it is to be attributed to the efficient predominating peril, whether it is or is not
in activity at the consummation of the disaster." In Brady v.
North-western Insurance Co., 11 Mich. 425, Martin, C. J., in
delivering the opinion of the court, said: "That which is the

INSURANCE Co. v. BOON.

actual cause of the loss, whether operating directly or by putting intervening agencies, the operation of which could not be
reasonably avoided, in motion, by which the loss is produced, is
the cause to which such loss should be attributed." In St. John
v. American Mfutual Insurance Co., 11 N. Y. 519, the insurance
was against fire, but the policy exempted the insurers from any
loss occasioned by the explosion of a steam-boiler. A fire occurred, caused by an explosion, which destroyed the insured
property. The court, regarding the explosion, and not the fire,
as the predominating cause of the loss, held the insurers not
liable. Decisions are numerous to the same effect. Policies of
insurance do not protect an assured against his voluntary destruction of the thing insured. Yet in Gordon v. ]Rimmington,
supra, it was held that, when the captain of a ship insured
against fire burned her to prevent her falling into the hands of
the enemy, it was a loss by fire within the meaning of the
policy. It was because the fire was caused by the public
enemy. The act of the captain was the nearest cause in time,
but the danger of capture by the public enemy was regarded as
the dominating cause. Vide also Emerigon, tom. i. p. 434.
And we find the same principle followed in common practice.
Often, in case of a fire, much of the destruction is caused by
water applied in efforts to extinguish the flames. Yet it is not
doubted all that destruction is caused by the fire, and insurers
against fire are held liable for it. In Lynd v. Tynsboro', 11
Cush. (iass.) 563, where it appeared that a traveller had been
injured by leaping from his carriage, exercising ordinary care
and prudence, in consequence of a near approach to a defect in a
highway, the town was held liable, though the carriage did not
come to the defect. The defect was regarded as the actual, the
dominating, cause. And in this court similar doctrine has been
asserted. Insurance Company v. Tweed, 7 Wall. 44, the principle of which case, we think, should rule the present. There
it was, in effect, ruled that the efficient cause, the one that set
others in motion, is the cause to which the loss is to be attributed, though the other causes may follow it and operate more
immediately in producing the disaster.
In Butler v. Wildman, 3 B. & A. 398, may be found a case
where the captain of a Spanish ship, in order to prevent a

INSURANCE CO. V. BoN.

[SX.p. Ct.

quantity of Spanish dollars from falling into the hands of an
enemy by whom he was about to be attacked, threw them into
the sea. The suit was upon a policy insuring the dollars, and
judgment was given for the plaintiff. Bayley, J., said, " It
was the duty of the master to prevent any thing which could
strengthen the hands of the enemy from falling into their possession. Now, as money would strengthen the enemy, it was
the duty of the master to throw it overboard; and the sacrifice
of the money was, therefore, ex justa causa. It seems to me,
therefore, this is a loss by jettison. But it is not a loss by
jettison: it is a loss by enemies. It clearly falls within the
principle stated by Emerigon, in the case of the destruction of
a ship by fire; and I think the enemy was the proximate cause
of the loss." Holroyd, J., said, "It seemed to him it was a
loss by enemies, for the meditated attack was the direct cause
of the loss." A similar doctrine was asserted in Barton v. The
Home Insurance Co., 42 Mo. 156; and in -Marcyv. AercA ants'
JMutual Insurance Co., 19 La. Ann. 388. It is a doctrine resting
upon reason, and in accord with the common understanding of
men. Applying it to the facts found in the present case, the
conclusion is inevitable, that the fire which caused the destruction of the plaintiffs' property happened or took place, not merely
in consequence of, but by means of, the rebel invasion and military or usurped power. The fire occurred while the attack was in
progress, and when it was about being successful. The attack,
as a cause, never ceased to operate until the loss was complete.
Itwas the causa causans which set in operation every agency
that contributed to the destruction. It created the military
necessity for the destruction of the military stores in the
city hall, and made it the duty of the commanding officer
of the Federal forces to destroy them. His act, therefore,
in setting fire to the city hall, was directly in the line of the
force set in motion by the usurping power, and what that
power. must have anticipated as a consequence of its action.
It cannot be said that was not anticipated which military ne
cessity recognized. And the insurers and the assured must
have looked for such action by the Federal forces as a probable
and reasonable consequence of an overpowering attack upon
the city by an invading rebellious force. Having excepted

Oct.1877.]

INSURANCE

Co. v. BOON.

from the risk undertaken responsibility for such an attack, they
excepted with it responsibility for the consequences reasonably
to be anticipated from it.
The court below regarded the action of the United States
military authorities as a sufficient cause intervening between
the rebel attack and the destruction of the plaintiffs' property,
and therefore held it to be the responsible proximate cause.
With this we cannot concur.
The proximate cause, as we have seen, is the dominant
cause, not the one which is incidental to that cause, its mere
instrument, though the latter may be nearest in place and time
to the loss. In illilwaukee J Saint Paul Railway Co. v. Kellogg, 94 U. S. 469, we said, in considering what is the proximate and what the remote cause of an injury, "The inquiry
must always be whether there was any intermediate cause disconnected from the primaryfault, and self-operating, which produced the injury." In the present case, the burning of the city
hall and the spread of the fire afterwards was not a new and
independentcause of loss. On the contrary, it was ali incident, a
necessary incident and consequence, of the hostile rebel attack
on the town, - a military necessity caused by the attack. It
was one of a continuous chain of events brought into being by
the usurped military power, - events so linked together as to
form one continuous whole. The case is, therefore, clearly
within the doctrine asserted by Emerigon, and held in Butler
v. Wildman, and in the other cases we have cited. Hence it
must be concluded that the fire which destroyed the plaintiffs'
property took place by means of an invasion or military or
usurped power, and that it was excepted from the risk undertaken by the insurers.

whenever they do so, the iss'ies of fact in the case may be tried
and determined by the court without the intervention of a jury.
Where a jury is waived and the issues of fact are submitted
to the court, the finding of the court may be either general or
special, as in cases where an issue of fact is found by a jury;
but where the finding is general, the parties are concluded by
the determination of the court, except in cases where exceptions
are taken to the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial.
Such rulings, if duly presented by a bill of exceptions, may
be reviewed here, even though the finding is general; but the
finding of the court, if general, cannot be reviewed in this court
by bill of exceptions, or in any other manner, as the act of Congress provides that the finding "shall have the same effect as
the verdict of a jury" in a case where no such waiver is made.

Facts found by a jury could only be re-examined under the
rules of the common law, either by the granting of a new trial
by the court where the case was tried or to which the record
was returnable, or by the award of a venire facias de novo by
the appellate court for some error of law which intervened in the
proceedings. Parsonsv. Bedford, 2 Pet. 448 ; 2 Story, Const.,

Nothing, therefore, is open to re-examintion in such a case,
except such of the rulings of the court made in the progress of
the trial as are duly presented by a bill of exceptions.
When a court sits in the place of a jury, and finds the facts,
this court cannot review that finding. If there is any error in
such a case, shown by the record, in admitting or rejecting
testimony, it can be reviewed here; but when the court, by
permission of the parties, takes the place of the jury, its finding of facts is conclusive, precisely as if a jury had found them
by verdict. Basset v. United States, 9 Wall. 38.
Matters of fact under such a submission must be found by
the Circuit Court and not by the Supreme Court, as the act of
Congress provides that the issues of fact may be tried and determined by the Circuit Court where the suit is brought.

house, to a large amount, were owned by the plaintiffs; and
they procured the storehouse and the goods to be insured by
the defendants against loss or damage by fire, in the company
of the defendants, to the amount of $6,000, to be paid within
sixty days after notice and proof of loss made by the assured,
in conformity with the conditions of the policy, subject to the
proviso that the company shall not be liable to make good any
loss or damage by fire which may happen or take place by
means of any invasion, insurrection, riot, or civil commotion, or
of any military or usurped power, or any loss by theft at or
after a fire.
On the 15th of October, 1864, the storehouse, with the goods
insured, was consumed by fire, as is more fully explained in the
transcript. Payment of the loss being refused, the plaintiffs
instituted the present suit. Service was made; and the defendants appeared and pleaded the general issue, with notice of
special matter to be offered under that plea. Pursuant to the
act of Congress, the parties filed a stipulation in writing with
the clerk of the court, waiving a trial by jury; and the court
proceeded to try and determine the issues of fact in the case,
and the statement is, that the parties and their counsel were
fully heard.
By the record, it also appears that the court, upon due con
sideration, " found the issues for the plaintiffs, and rendered
judgment in their favor" for the sum of $9,177.50 damages and
costs of suit; and that execution issued therefor. Superadded
to that is the statement of the clerk, that, upon the rendering of
said judgment, the opinion of the court was filed in said matter
in the words and figures set forth in the printed transcript.
Judgment was rendered on the 28th of April, 1874, and on the
first day of June in the same year execution against the defendants was issued to the plaintiffs, which, on the 17th of August
thereafter, was returned unsatisfied; and on the same day an
alias execution was issued in their favor, which has not yet
been returned.
Application was made to the circuit judge by the defendants,
July 13, 1874, for leave to make a case, or bill of exceptions in
the case, to contain the evidence given at the trial, special findings of fact and law to be signed by the court or one of the

justices who presided in the trial, and to contain such exceptions thereto as the defendants may desire to make; and that
the same, when made and settled, may be filed nune pro tune as
of the term when the judgment was rendered, and for a stay of
execution, Instead of granting the application, the circuit
judge laid a rule on the plaintiffs or their counsel to show
cause, on a day and at a place named, why the defendants
should not have the leave requested in the application.
Subsequently the parties, by stipulation, changed the time and
place for hearing the rule to show cause, and agreed that it
might be heard by Judge Shipman, subject to the right of the
plaintiffs to object to the jurisdiction of the court or any judge
thereof to entertain such an application after the expiration
of the term when the judgment was rendered. Due ]hearing
was had before the district judge, and he passed an order to the
effect following: that a finding of facts in the cause, with the
conclusions of the court thereon, conformably to the opinion of
the court heretofore filed, be prepared by the defendants and
be submitted to the plaintiffs, to be approved and signed by
the court at the September Term of the Circuit Court, to be
holden at Hartford on the third Tuesday of September, 1874,
and that the defendants have leave to prepare a bill of exceptions which shall be allowed and signed by the judge of said
court at said term, which said special finding of facts and a bill
of exceptions shall be made and allowed and entered of record
nune pro tune as of the April Term, 1874, of said court, and that
execution be stayed as therein provided.
In conformity with that order, the special finding of facts and
the bill of exceptions exhibited in the transcript were, on the
third Tuesday of September, signed, filed, and entered of record nune pro tune as of the previous April Term of the said
court, in the words and figures specially set forth in the transeript. Just preceding the entry of the judgment, the record
states that the court found the issues for the plaintiffs, and
rendered judgment in their favor. Five months after that, the
court allowed the defendants to prepare a special finding, and
made an order that it be entered of record as of the day of the
judgment rendered at the preceding term, in direct contradiction of the entry made at the judgment term.

Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE CO. V. BOON.

Beyond all doubt, the finding which preceded the judgment,
as set forth in the transcript, is general, and it is equally clear
that the judgment was rendered on the 28th of April, in pursuance of that finding. What is now called the " finding of facts"
and the bill of exceptions were filed at the next term of the
court, which was held at Hartford the following September,
nearly five months after the judgment was rendered. Both
of those papers were filed and entered of record subject to
the objections of the plaintiffs; and the defendants sued out the
present writ of error, and removed the cause into this court.
Two errors are assigned by the defendants, as follows: 1.
That the court, instead of adjudging that the defendants were
liable, should have decided that they were exempt from liability, by virtue of the proviso in the policy. 2. That the judgment, instead of being for the plaintiffs, should have been for
the defendants.
Any discussion of the question touching the regularity of the
bill of exceptions, or of any question therein raised, is wholly
unnecessary, as the errors assigned do not present any question
of the kind; and, if they did, it is clear that no such question
could be of any benefit to the defendants, for two reasons,
either of which is conclusive against the defendants: 1. Because the record does not show that the defendants objected to
any ruling of the court during the progress of the trial.
Repeated decisions of this court have settled the rule that
the exception must show that it was taken and reserved by
the party at the trial, but that it may be drawn out and signed
or sealed by the judge afterwards. United States v. Breitling,
20 How. 252; Dredge v. Forsyth, 2 Black, 563; Kellogg v.
Forsyth, 2 id. 571.
2. Because the bill of exceptions was neither made, signed,
nor entered of record until the next term, nearly five mon ths
after the judgment was rendered. Flandersv. Tweed, 9 Wall.
425.
Unless it appears that the objection to the ruling of the
court was taken at the trial, the bill of exceptions drawn up
and signed subsequently to the judgment, if it has no other
foundation than a ruling of the court not objected to at the
time, cannot properly be regarded as a part of the record.

INSURANCE CO. V. BOON.

[Sup. Ct.

Tested by these considerations, it is clear that the questions
presented in the paper called the bill of exceptions must be
overruled, for the reason that the paper in question was never
signed, filed, or entered of record in season to constitute a part of
the record.
Suppose that is so, then it is clear that there is no proper
bill of exceptions in this case. Concede that, and it follows
that the paper called "finding of facts " is the only matter that
remains for re-examination.
Even the defendants do not contend that the opinion of the
court filed in the case, at the date of the judgment, is the special finding contemplated by the act of Congress empowering
parties to waive a jury, nor do they deny that the general finding therein specified concludes the parties where there are no
proper exceptions to the rulings of the court during the progress
of the trial. Such a denial, if made, would be of no avail, as
the act of Congress provides that the finding, -whether general
or special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury ;
and every one knows that the seventh amendment provides that
no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any
court of the United States than according to the rules of the
common law.
Confirmation of those views, if any be needed, is found in
numerous decisions of this court, in which the very point as to
the legal effect of a general finding of the Circuit Court is
expressly adjudged and determined. Cooper v. Omokundro, 19
Wall. 65; Crews v. Brewer, id. 70; Insurance Company v. Sea,
21 id. 158.
Issues of fact in such a case may be tried and determined by
the Circuit Court; and, if it be true that the general finding of
the court shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury,
then it follows that the finding can only be re-examined either
by a motion for a new trial in the court where the finding was
made, or by the award of a venire faeias de novo in the appellate court. When the finding is special, the review may also
extend to the determination of the sufficiency of the facts
found to support the judgment; but "if the jury is waived, and
the court chooses to find generally for one side or the other,
the losing party," says Mr. Justice Bradley, "has no redress, on

Oct. 1877.]

INSURAN-cE Co. v. Boom

error, except for the wrongful admission or rejection of evidence." Dirst v. Morris, 14 id. 484.
Viewed in the light of these suggestions, it is clear that the
general finding in such a case concludes the right of the parties,
unless there is some proper exception to the ruling of the court
in the progress of the trial.
Where the finding is general, nothing is open to revie, here
except such rulings of the court in the progress of the trial
as are duly presented in a bill of exceptions, and, even when
the finding is special, the re-examination can only extend to the
question whether the facts found are sufficient to support the
judgment. Propositions of fact found by the Circuit Court in
such a case are equivalent to a special verdict, and, consequently,
are irreviewable here except for the purpose of determining the
single question whether they are sufficient to warrant the judgment; nor is the Circuit Court required to make a special finding, as the act of Congress provides that the finding of the
Circuit Court may be either general or special, giving the Circuit
Court the same power in that regard as has always been possessed by a jury. Insurance Company v. Polson, 18 Wall. 287 ;
1 Archb. Pr. (2d Am. ed.) 218; Co. Litt. 228 b; Litt., sect.
386; 8 Bl. Com. 378.
Exceptions are allowed to the rulings of the court in the progress of the trial, and the provision is, that the review, if the
finding is special, may also extend to the determination of the
sufficiency of the facts found to support the judgment; but if
there be no exceptions to the rulings of the court in the progress
of the trial, and no special finding of the facts, the judgment
must be affirmed, as this court has no power to re-examine
any question decided by the Circuit Court.
Sufficient has already been remarked to show that there is no
valid bill of exceptions in the case, and that the paper in the
record called "finding of facts" was not signed or filed until
the next term after the general finding was made, and nearly
five months after the judgment was rendered.
Redress here by writ of error can only be had when a party
is aggrieved by some error in the foundation, proceedings, judgment, or execution of a suit in a court of record; and it is for
that reason th.t the bill of exceptions is allowed, in order that

INSURANCE

Co. v.

[Sup. Ct.

certain matters resting in parol may be incorporated into the
record for the inspection of the proper appellate tribunal.
Suydam v. Williamson, 20 How. 427.
Matters resting in parol, like the opinion of the court, are
not a part of the record, and nothing therein contained can be
assigned for error. Williams v. Norris, 12 Wheat. 118; Davis
v. Packard, 6 Pet. 41; iiedbury v. State, 24 How. 414.
Findings of fact in the form called special findings, like a
special verdict, furnish the means of reviewing such questions
of law arising in the case as respect the sufficiency of the facts
found to support the judgment; but, where the finding is general,
the losing party cannot claim the right to review any question
of law arising in the case, except such as grow out of the rulings
of the Circuit Court in the progress of the trial, which do not
in any sense whatever include the general finding, nor the conclusions of the Circuit Court embodied in the general finding,
as the general finding is in the nature of a general verdict, and
constitutes the foundation of the judgment.
No review of a judgment in such a case can be made here
under the writ of error, unless it is accompanied by a special
finding or an authorized statement of facts, without imposing
upon this court the duty of hearing the whole case, law and
fact, as on appeal in equity or admiralty, which would operate
as a repeal of the act of Congress authorizing parties to waive
a trial by jury, and also would violate*the provision of the Judiciary Act, which prohibits the Supreme Court from reversing
any case "for any error in fact." 1 Stat. 85.
Three propositions are admitted by the plaintiffs, which it is
important to bear in mind, as follows: 1. That no formal
special finding was made, signed, or filed until the commencement of the Circuit Court at the next term after the judgment
was rendered, when the paper called in the transcript " finding
of facts" was signed, filed, and entered of record. 2. That it
has been repeatedly decided by this court that the opinion of the
court below does not constitute such a formal finding as that
required in such a case. Insurance Company v. Tweed, 7 Wall.

suggested rather than argued that the judgment was unauthorized or irregular.
But the suggestion is entirely without merit, as neither the
law nor justice requires that the general finding of the court
shall be in writing. On the contrary, the conclusion may be
orally announced, and the direction to the clerk to enter the
judgment may also be oral. Nor is it correct to suppose that the
statement in the transcript, that the court, upon due consideration, found the issues for the plaintiffs, is either unauthorized
or without legal effect. What is stated in the conclusion of
the opinion, to wit, that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment
for the amount of the insurance, would have been sufficient to
authorize the clerk to enter judgment if the announcement had
been oral instead of in writing, as it was, and it is abundantly
sufficient, when taken in connection with the judgment and the
statement immediately preceding it, to warrant the conclusion
that the issues were duly found for the plaintiffs, and that the
judgment in their favor is regular, and that it was duly recorded.
Power is vested in this court, where the finding is special, to
inquire and determine, on writ of error, whether the facts found
are sufficient to support the judgment; but a report of the evidence, without such special finding, will not give this court
jurisdiction to re-examine that question; nor will the fact that
the court below stated some of the facts in an opinion accompanying the judgment alter things in the least, it appearing
that the facts exhibited in the opinion were stated, not as a
special finding, but rather as a ground to show why the judge
came to the conclusion set forth in the record. Diekinson v.
T]e Planters'Bank, sup ra.
Argument to show that the facts exhibited in the opinion
filed in the case, which are not stated as a special finding, are
insufficient to give jurisdiction in such a case, is unnecessary,
as that proposition is admitted by the defendants. Certain
facts are stated in the opinion of the court which was filed in
the case, but they are not stated as a special finding. Instead
of that, they are merely facts advanced, as Mr. Justice Strong
said in the case last cited, as reasons why the Circuit Court
came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment for the amount of the insurance.

142

INSURANCE CO. V. BOON.

LSup. Ci.

Grant all that, and still it is insisted by the defendants that
it was entirely within the power and discretion of the Circuit Court to make the order in question at the time it was
made, and to put the findings of the court into more formal
shape; but it is unfortunate for the defendants that the law is
well settled the other way, nor do the authorities which the
defendants cite, when properly applied, warrant any other
conclusion.
Exceptions are prepared by the complaining party. Special
findings are prepared by the court. Where the exception is
duly taken and reserved at the trial, it may, in the discretion
of the judge, be drawn out, and be signed or sealed by the judge
afterwards. United States v. Breitling, 20 How. 252. Decided
cases to the same effect are numerous.
It is a settled principle, say the court, in Walton v. United
States, 9 Wheat. 651, cited by defendants, that no bill of exceptions is valid which is not for matter excepted to at the trial.
We do not mean to say, remarked the court in that case, that
the bill of exceptions should be formally drawn and signed
before the trial is at an end. It will be sufficient if the exception be taken at the trial and noted by the court with the
requisite certainty; and, where that is done, it may be reduced to
form, and be signed by the judge during the term. Stanton v.
.Embry, 93 U. S. 548.
Authorities of the kind give no support whatever to the proposition of the defendants, in view of the facts of the case as
they appear in the transcript. Judgment was rendered for the
plaintiffs in the usual course, without any intimation from the
court that any special finding would be filed in the case, or any
request being made by the defendants for such a finding; and
the record shows that the plaintiffs in the mean time had taken
out execution for the amount of the judgment. Muller v. -Elers,
91 U. S. 249. Valid exceptions can never be allowed, unless
taken at the trial; and they will never be sustained, unless completed within the term.
Prompt action in respect to a statement of facts is also required; and, where it appeared that nearly three months had
elapsed from the rendition of the judgment before it was filed,
this court held that it was an irregularity, for which the court

. Oct. 1877.]

INSURANCE

Co. v.

BooN.

was bound to disregard it, and to treat it as no part of the
record. Flanders v. Tweed, 9 Wall. 425.
Execution had issued in this case before the court granted the
order that a special finding should be made, signed, and entered
of record; and, inasmuch as the term in which the judgment was
rendered had then expired, it is clear that the court helow had
not at that time any power to supply a special finding of facts
Nroonan v. Bradley, 12 Wall. 121; Waslington Bridge Co. v.
Stewart, 3 How. 413 ; Skillin's Ex'rs v. May's Bx'rs, 6 Cranch,
267; Ex parte Sibbald, 12 Pet. 488; Peck v. Sanderson, 18
How. 42; 1Itartin v. Hunter'sLessee, 1 Wheat. 304; Boemer v.
Simon, 91 U. S. 149.
Support to the theory that the special finding, if any, in such
a case should be prepared and filed before or at the time the
judgment is rendered, is derived from the present rule of the
Court of Claims. Prior to its adoption, the finding of facts
in that court was sometimes prepared and filed subsequent to
the rendition of judgment, which was not satisfactory. Dissatisfaction arising, this court adopted the rule that, in all cases
in which either party is entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court,
" the Court of Claims shall make and file their finding of facts
and their conclusions of law thereon in open court before or at
the time they enter their judgment in the case," which provision, it is believed, is universally approved by the legal profession; but the requirement is much greater where the special
finding is made by the Circuit Court, for the reason that the
act of Congress provides that the findings, whether general or
special, shall have the same effect as the verdict of a jury, and
no one ever supposed that the judgment might precede the
return of the verdict on which it is required to be founded.
MR. JUSTICE MILLER concurred with MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD.
MR. JUSTICE FIELD agreed with MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD
and Mr. JUSTICE MmLLER that there were no special findings in
the record which the court could consider; but as the majority of
the court reached a different conclusion, and held that the case
was properly here on its merits, he was of opinion that the law
was with the defendant below, -that
the loss incurred was
within the exception of the policy.
