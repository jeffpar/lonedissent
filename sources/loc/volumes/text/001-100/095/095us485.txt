eight bills )f exceptions, which purport to be applicable to each
of the two cases; and the judgment in each case is removed
here by one writ of error, though the transcript does not show
that the two cases were ever consolidated. Such proceedings
are palpably irregular; but inasmuch as they are not the subject of objection by either party, the court has decided to exer
cise jurisdiction and dispose of the controversy. Separate
judgments having been entered in the court of original jurisdiction; the judgment rendered here must be separately applied
Judgment affirmed
in the court below.

HALL v. DECuiB.
The Supreme Court of Louisiana having decided that an act of the General
Assembly, approved Feb. 23, 1869, entitled "An Act to enforce the thirteenth
article of the Constitution of this State, and to regulate the licenses mentioned
in said thirteenth article," requires those engaged in the transportation of passengers among the States to give all persons travelling within that State, upon
vessels employed in such business, equal rights and privileges in all parts of
the vessel, without distinction on account of race or color; and subjects to an
action for damages the owner of such a vessel who excludes colored passengers, on account of their color, from the cabin set apart by him for the use of
whites during the passage: this court, accepting as conclusive this construction of the act by the highest court of the State, holds that the act, so far as
it has such operation, is a regulation of inter-state commerce, and therefore,
to that extent, unconstitutional and void.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana.
By the thirteenth article of the Constitution of Louisiana it
is provided that "all persons shall enjoy equal rights and privileges upon any conveyance of a public character." By an act
of the General Assembly, entitled " An Act to enforce the thirteenth article of the Constitution of this State, and to regulate
the licenses mentioned in said thirteenth article," approved
Feb. 23, 1869, it was enacted as follows: "SECTION 1. All persons engaged within this State, in the business
of common carriers of passengers, shall have the right to refuse to
admit any person to their railroad cars, street cars, steamboats, or
other water-crafts, stage-coaches, omnibuses, or other vehicles, or

[Sup. Ct.

to expel any person therefrom after admission, when such person
shall, on demand, refuse or neglect to pay the customary fare, or
when such person shall be of infamous character, or shall be guilty,
after admission to the conveyance of the carrier, of gross, vulgar, or
disorderly conduct, or who shall commit any act tending to injure the
business of the carrier, prescribed for the management of his business, after such rules and regulations shall have been made known :
Provided, said rules and regulations make no discrimination o,
account of race or color; and shall have the right to refuse any
person admission to such conveyance where there is not room or
suitable accommodations; and, except in cases above enumerated, all
persons engaged in the business of common carriers of passengers
aire forbidden to refuse admission to their conveyance, or to expel
therefrom any person whomsoever."
"SECT. 4. For a violation of any of the provisions of the first and
second sections of this act, the party injured shall have a right of
action to recover any damage, exemplary as well as actual, whic4
he may sustain, before any court of competent jurisdiction." Acts
of 1869, p. 37; Rev. Stat. 1870, p. 93.
Benson, the defendant below, was the master and owner of
the" Governor Allen," a steamboat enrolled and licensed under
the laws of the United States for the coasting trade, and plying
as a regular packet for bhe transportation of freight and passengers between New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana, and
Vicksburg, in the State of Mississippi, touching at the intermediate landings both within and without Louisiana, as occasion required. The defendant in error, plaintiff below, a
person of color, took passage upon the boat, on her trip up the
river from New Orleans, for Hermitage, a landing-place within
Louisiana, and being refused accommodations, on account of her
color, in the cabin specially set apart for white persons, brought
this action in the Eighth District Court for the Parish of New
Orleans, under the provisions of the act above recited, to recover damages for her mental and physical suffering on that
account. Benson, by way of defence, insisted, among other
things, that the statute was inoperative and void as to him, in
respect to the matter complained of, because, as to his business,
it was an attempt to " regulate commerce among the States,"
and, therefore, in conflict with art. 1, sect. 8, par. .3, of the Constitution of the United States. The District Court of the par-

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIR.

ish held that the statute made it imperative upon Benson to
admit Mrs. DeCuir to the privileges of the cabin for white
persons, and that it was not a regulation of commerce among
the States, and, therefore, not void. After trial, judgment was
given against Benson for $1,000 ; from which he appealed to
the Supreme Court of the State, where the rulings of the District Court were sustained.
This decision of the Supreme Court is here for re-examination under sect. 709 of the Revised Statutes.

. AIarr for the plaintiff in error.
Jr. -E. K. Vashington, contra.
iR. CnEF JUSTICE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
court.
For the purposes of this case, we must treat the act of Louisiana of Feb. 23, 1869, as requiring those engaged in inter-state
commerce to give all persons travelling in that State, upon the
public conveyances employed in such business, equal rights
and privileges in all parts of the conveyance, without distinction or discrimination on account of race or color. Such was
the construction given to that act in the courts below, and it is
conclusive upon us as the construction of a State law by the
State courts. It is with this provision of the statute alone
that we have to deal. We have nothing whatever to do with
it as a regulation of internal commerce, or as affecting any thing
else than commerce among the States.
There can be no doubt but that exclusive power has been
conferred upon Congress in respect to the regulation of commerce among the several States. The difficulty has never been
as to the existence of this power, but as to what is to be deemed
an encroachment upon it; for, as has been often said, "legislation may in a great variety of ways affect commerce and persons engaged in it without constituting a regulation of it
within the meaning of the Constitution." Shierlock v. Ailing,
93 U. S. 103; State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, 15 Wall.
284. Thus, in iMltnn v. Jllinois, 94 U. S. 113, it was decided
that a State might regulate the charges of public warehouses.

HALL v. DECuiR.[

[Sup. Ct.

and in Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad Co. v. Iowa, id.
155, of railroads situate entirely within the State, even though
those engaged in commerce among the States might sometimes
use the warehouses or the railroads in the prosecution of their
business. So, too, it has been held that States may authorize
the construction of dams and bridges across navigable streams
situate entirely within their respective jurisdictions. Tillson v.
Blackbird Creek illarsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 ; Pound v. Turck, supra,
p. 459; Gilrnanv.Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713. The same is true
of turnpikes and ferries. By such statutes the States regulate,
as a matter of domestic concern, the instruments of commerce
situated wholly within their own jurisdictions, and over which
they have exclusive governmental control, except when employed in foreign or inter-state commerce. As they can only be
used in the State, their regulation for all purposes may properly
be assumed by the State, until Congress acts in reference to
their foreign or inter-state relations. When Congress does act,
the State laws are superseded only to the extent that they affect
commerce outside the State as it comes within the State. It
has also been held that health and inspection laws may be
passed by the States, G-ibbons v. Qgden, 9 Wheat. 1; and that
Congress may permit the States to regulate pilots and pilotage
until it shall itself legislate upon the subject, Cooley v. Board
of Wardens, &c., 12 How. 299. The line which separates the
powers of the States from this exclusive power of Congress is
not always distinctly marked, and oftentimes it is not easy to
determine on which side a particular case belongs. Judges not
unfrequently differ in their reasons for a decision in which
they concur. Under such circumstances it would be a useless
task to undertake to fix an arbitrary rule by which the line
must in all cases be located. It is far better to leave a matter
of such delicacy to be settled in each case upon a view of the
particular rights involved.
But we think it may safely be said that State legislation
which seeks to impose a direct burden upon inter-state commerce,
or to interfere directly with its freedom, does encroach upon the
exclusive power of Congress. The statute now under consideration, in our opinion, occupies that position. It does not act
upon the business through the local instruments to be employed

Oct. 1877.]

HALL V.

DECuRm.

after coming within the State, but directly upon the business
as. it comes into the State from without or goes out from within.
While it purports only to control the carrier'when engaged
within the State, it must necessarily influence his conduct to
some extent in the management of his business throughout his
entire voyage. His disposition of passengers taken up and put
down within the State, or taken up within to be carried without,
cannot but affect in a greater or less degree those taken up
without and brought within, and sometimes those taken up and
put down without. A passenger in the cabin set apart for the
use of whites without the State must, when the boat comes
within, share the accommodations of that cabin with such colored persons as may come on board afterwards, if the law is
enforced.
It was to meet just such a case that the commercial clause
in the Constitution was adopted. The river Mlississippi passes
through or along the borders of ten different States, and its
tributaries reach many more. The commerce upon these waters
is immense, and its regulation clearly a matter of national concern. If each State was at liberty to regulate the conduct of
carriers while within its jurisdiction, the confusion likely to
follow could not but be productive of great inconvenience and
unnecessary hardship. Each State could provide for its own
passengers and regulate the transportation of its own freight,
regardless of the interests of others. Nay more, it could prescribe rules by which the carrier must be governed within the
State in respect to passengers and property brought from
without. On one side of the river or its tributaries he might
be required to observe one set of rules, and on the other an
other. Commerce cannot flourish in the midst of such embarrassments. No carrier of passengers can conduct his business
with satisfaction to himself, or comfort to those employing
him, if on one side of a State line his passengers, both white
and colored, must be permitted to occupy the same cabin, and
on the other be kept separate. Uniformity in the regulations
by which he is to be governed from one end to the other of his
route is a necessity in his business, and to secure it Congress,
which is untrammelled by State lines, has been invested with
the exclusive legislative power of determining what such regu-

HALL v. DECUIR.

[[Sup. Ct.

lations shall be. If this statute can be enforced against those
engaged in inter-state cQmmerce, it may be as well against thqse
engaged in foreign ; and the master of a ship clearing from New
Orleans for Liverpool, having passengers on board, would be
compelled to carry all, white and colored, in the same cabin
during his passage down the river, or be subject to an action
for damages, "exemplary as well as actual," by any one who
felt himself aggrieved because he had been excluded on account
of his color.
This power of regulation may be exercised without legislation as well as with it. By refraining from action, Congress,
in effect, adopts as its own regulations those which the common
law or the civil law, where that prevails, has provided for the
government of such business, and those which the States, in the
regulation of their domestic concerns, have established affecting commerce, but not regulating it within the meaning of the
Constitution. In fact, congressional legislation is only necessary to cure defects in existing laws, as they are discovered,
and to adapt such laws to new developments of trade. As was
said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court in Welton v.
The State of M11issouri, 91 U. S. 282, "inaction [by Congress]
. . . is equivalent to a declaration that inter-state commerce
shall remain free and untrammelled." Applying that principle
to the circumstances of this case, congressional inaction left
Benson at liberty to adopt such reasonable rules and regulations
for the disposition of passengers upon his boat, while pursuing
her voyage within Louisiana or without, as seemed to him
most for the interest of all concerned. The statute under
which this suit is brought, as construed by the State court,
seeks to take away from him that power so long as he is within
Louisiana; and while recognizing to the fullest extent the
principle which sustains a statute, unless its unconstitutionality
is clearly established, we think this statute, to the extent that
it requires those engaged in the transportation cf passengers
among the States to carry colored passengers in Louisiana in
the same cabin with whites, is unconstitutional and void. If
the public good requires such legislation, it must come from
Congress and not from the States.
We confine our decision to the statute in its effect upon

foreign and inter-state commerce, expressing no opinion as to
its validity in any other respect.
Judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded, with
instructions to reverse the judgment of the District Court, and
direct such further proceedings in conformity with this opinion
as may appear to be necessary; and it is
So ordered.
MR. JUSTICE CLIFFORD concurred in the judgment, and
delivered the following opinion: Power to regulate commerce is, by the Constitution, vested in
Congress; and it is well-settled law that the word "commerce "
as used in the Constitution comprehends navigation, which
extends to every species of commercial intercourse between the
United States and foreign nations, and to all commerce in the
several States, except such as is completely internal, and which
does not extend to or affect the other States. Tonnage Cases,
12 Wall. 204.
Beyond all doubt, the power as conferred includes navigation
as well as traffic, and it is equally well settled that it extends
to ships and vessels exclusively employed in conveying passengers as well as to those engaged in transporting goods and
merchandise. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1.
Equality of right and privilege is guaranteed by the thirteenth article of the State Constitution to every person in the
State transported in the vehicles or water-craft of a common
carrier of passengers, in the words following, to wit: "All
persons shall enjoy equal rights and privileges upon any conveyance of a public character." Rules and regulations to enforce that provision have been enacted by the State legislature,
as fully set forth in the transcript. Sess. Laws La. (1869), 37.
Common carriers of the kind, it is conceded, may adopt
rules and regulations for the management of their business,
not inconsistent with the State Constitution and the enactment
of the State legislature. By the terms of that enactment they
may refuse to admit persons to such conveyance when the
vehicle or water-craft does not contain room or suitable accommodations for the purpose, and they may refuse to admit an
applicant, or expl1 him or her after admission, if the applicant

HALL v. DECUIR.

[Sup. Ct.

refuses to pay fare, or is of infamous character, or is guilty, in
the conveyance, of gross, vulgar, or disorderly conduct, or shall
commit any act in violation of the known rules and regulations
of such carrier tending to injure his business, provided such
rules and regulations make no discrimination on account of
race or color. Such rules and regulations as are there authorized must be duly made known to the public in order to be
operative, and they must not deny to the applicant any right
or privilege on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude.
Sufficient appears to show that the plaintiff is a person of
color, and that the defendant is the master and owner of the
steamer, which is a packet vessel duly enrolled and licensed for
the coasting trade, and that the vessel was engaged in carrying
passengers and cargo between the port of New Orleans in the
State of Louisiana and the port of Vicksburg in the State of
Mississippi; that the steamer has two cabins for the accommodation of passengers, conveniently arranged one above the
other; that the upper is assigned to white persons and that
the lower is assigned to person of color, both being constructed
with state-rooms, cabin, and a hall used as a dining-room where
meals are furnished; that the plaintiff, being at the time in
New Orleans and desiring to visit her plantation in another
parish of the same State, went on board the steamer to secure
her passage to the proper landing near her plantation; that
the clerk of the steamer, to whom she applied for a passage in
the upper cabin, having previously informed her agent that he
could not give her a passage in that cabin, refused her request,
telling her at the same time that he would give her a passage
in the lower cabin; that the plaintiff declined to accept a
berth in the lower cabin, and that she passed the night during
which she remained on board sitting in a chair in what is
known as the recess back of the upper cabin.
Both parties concede that the steamer was engaged in one
of her regular trips from New Orleans to Vicksburg, and it
appears that the plaintiff topk passage for the landing called
the Hermitage, and that on arriving there she paid five
dollars fare, which is the regular fare to that landing for persons whose passage is in the lower cabin, and that it was two

Oct. 1877.]

HALL

v. DECUIR.

dollars less than the regular fare for persons whose passage is
in the upper cabin.
Proof of a decisive character is exhibited that the plaintiff
applied for a berth in the upper cabin, which was refused, and
that she declined to accept one in the lower cabin, -"hich by
the rules and regulations of the steamer is assigned for persons
of color. ,Based upon these undisputed facts, the charge of the
declaration is that the plaintiff was denied the equal rights and
privileges guaranteed and secured to all persons by the State
Constitution and the aforesaid act of the State legislature.
Superadded to that is also the charge that such equal rights
and privileges were denied to her on account of her race and
color, for which she claims actual and exemplary damages in
the sum of $75,000.
Service was made, and the defendant appeared and set up,
among others, the defences following: 1. That the steamer,
being enrolled and licensed according to the act of Congress
to pursue the coasting trade, is governed by the laws of the
United States, and may make all reasonable rules and regulations for the prosecution of her" business. 2. That the State
Constitution and law set up are in violation of the provision
of the Federal Constitution which authorizes Congress to
regulate commerce among the several States. 3. That the
steamer at the time alleged was engaged in prosecuting commerce between the port of New Orleans in the State of
Louisiana, and the port of Vicksburg in the State of Mississippi,
and consequently was not subject to the State regulations set
up in the declaration.
Under the State practice these defences were pleaded as an
exception to the alleged cause of action. Hearing was had,
and the exception was overruled, the court giving leave to the
defendant to plead the same in his answer.
Pursuant to that leave, the defendant set up the same defences
in the answer, adding thereto the following: 1. That he as
owner had by law the right to prescribe rules and regulations
for the accommodation of passengers in his steamer. 2. That
all such steamers engaged in commerce and navigation in those
waters have a well-known regulation that persons of color are
not placed in the same cabin with white persons. 3. That the

HALL

v. DEOUIR.

[Sup. Or.

regulation is reasonable, u-sual, and customary, and was made
for the protection of their business, and had been well known
to the plaintiff for many years.
Evidence was subsequently taken, the cause submitted to
the court without a jury, the parties heard, and judgment entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,000 with interest and
cost; and the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of the
State, where the parties were again heard, and the judgment
of the District Court was affirmed.
Provision is made by the fourth section of the State statute
in question, that the plaintiff in such a case may recover
exemplary as well as actual damages for a violation of the
equal rights and privileges guaranteed to all persons in the
State by the State Constitution. Suppose this is so, still
the defendant insists that errors were committed by the court
in the trial of the case, for which the judgment should be
reversed; and the transcript shows that he sued out a writ of
error, and removed the case into this court.
Three of the errors assigned are still the subject of complaint: 1. That the court erred in holding that the State Constitution and statute in question are valid. 2. That the court
erred in deciding that those two provisions are not regulations
of commerce. 3. That the court erred in deciding that those
provisions are not in conflict with the Federal Constitution.
Congress, it is conceded, possesses the exclusive power to
regulate commerce; and it is everywhere admitted that both
traffic and navigation are included in its ordinary signification,
and that it embraces ships and vessels as the instruments of
intercourse and trade as well as the officers and seamen employed in their navigation. People v. Brooks, 4 Den. (N. Y.)
469.
Steamboats as well as sailing ships and vessels are required
to be enrolled and licensed; and the record shows that the
steamer in question had conformed in all respects to the regulations of Congress in that regard, and that she was duly enrolled and licensed for the coasting trade, and that she was
then and there engaged in the transportation of passengers
and freight between the port of New Orleans and the port of
Vicksburg.

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIR.

None, it is supposed, will deny the power of Congress to
enroll and license ships and vessels to sail from a port of one
State to the ports of another; and it is equally clear that such
ships and vessels are deemed ships and vessels of the United
States, and that they are entitled as such to all the privileges
of ships and vessels employed in the coasting trade. 1 Stat.
287, 305 ; 3 Kent, Com. (12th ed.) 145.
Ships and vessels enrolled and licensed as required by that
act are fully authorized to carry on that trade, the act of Con
gress in direct terms providing that such ships and vessels and
no others shall be deemed ships and vessels of the United
States, entitled to the privileges of ships and vessels employed
in the coasting trade or fisheries. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra;
1 Stat. 288; White's Bank v. Smith, 7 Wall. 646.
Language -more explicit could not well be chosen to express
the intention of Congress, and in my judgment it fully warrants the conclusion reached by Marshall, C. J., in that case,,
that the section contains a positive enactment that the ships
and vessels it describes shall be entitled to the privileges of
ships and vessels employed in the coasting trade.
Undisputed proof is exhibited in the record that the steamet
was duly enrolled and licensed, and that she was engaged in one
of her regular trips between the port of New Orleans and the
port of Vicksburg, transporting passengers and freight. Grant
that, and it follows that she must be deemed to have been a
ship or vessel of the United States entitled to all the privileges
of ships and vessels engaged in the coasting trade, pursuant to
the act of Congress providing for the enrolment and license
of such ships and vessels and the regulation of such trade.
Attempt was made in the leading case to maintain that the
license gave no right to trade, that its sole purpose was to
confer the American character on the ship or vessel; but the
court promptly rejected the proposition, and held that, where
the legislature attaches certain privileges aind exemptions to
the exercise of a right over which its control is absolute, the
law must imply a power to exercise the right; and the court
remarked, that it would be contrary to all reason and to the
course of human affairs to say that a State is unable to strip a
vessel of the particular Privileges attendant on the exercise of

HALL

v.

DEOUIP.

[Sup. OL

a right, and yet may annul the right itself. Instead of that, it
is the enrolment that proves the national character of the
ship or vessel; and the court decided in that case that the'
license could only be granted to vessels of twenty or more tons
burden which had already been enrolled, and that the license
to do a particular thing is a permission or authority to do that
thing, and, if granted by a person having authority to grant it,
transfers to the grantee whatever it purports to authorize.
Packets which ply along the -coast, say the court, as well as
those making foreign voyages, consider the transportation of
passengers as an important part of their business; and the
court adjudged directly that a coasting vessel employed in
that business is as much a portion of the national marine as
one employed in the transportation of cargo, and that no
reason exists for holding that such a vessel is withdrawn from
the regulating power of the national government.
Without more, these references to the opinion in that great
case are sufficient to show that the court there decided that
the enrolment act is of itself a sufficient regulation of the
navigation of all the public navigable rivers of the United
States to secure to ships and vessels of the United States sailing under a coasting license the free navigation of all such
public highways.
Confirmation of that proposition, even more decisive than
the opinion of the court, is found in the decree rendered in the
case, where the court adjudge that the licenses set up by the
appellant gave full authority to those vessels to navigate
the waters of the United States for the purpose of carrying
on the coasting trade, any law of the State to the contrary
notwithstanding, and that so much of the law of the State as
prohibited vessels so licensed from navigating the waters of the
State by means of fire or steam is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and void.
Cases have arisen in which it is held that the States may
rightfully adopt certain regulations touching the subject, which
are local in their operation, where none have been ordained
by Congress; but it will not be necessary to enter that field
of inquiry, or to attempt to reconcile those decisions with the
conclusion in this case, as it is clear from the remarks already

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIR.

made that Congress has prescribed the conditions which entitle
ships and vessels belonging to the national marine to pursue
the coasting trade without being subjected to burdensome and
inconsistent State regulations. Welton v. T]ie State of 31issouri,
91 U. S. 275.
Repeated decisions of this court have determined that the
power to regulate commerce embraces all the instruments by
which such commerce may be conducted; and it is settled law that where the subject to which the power applies
is national in its character, or of such a nature as to admit
of uniformity of regulation, the power is exclusive of all
State authority. Whatever subjects of this power, says Mr.
Justice Curtis, are in their nature national, or admit only
of one uniform system or plan of regulation, may justly
be said to be of such a nature as to require exclusive legislation by Congress. Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How.
299.
Difficulty may attend the effort to prescribe any definition
which will guide to a correct result in every case; but it is clear
that a regulation which imposes burdensome or impossible conditions on those engaged in commerce, whether with foreign
nations or among the several States, must of necessity be national in its character. Henderson et al. v. 11.ayor of New York,
92 U. S. 259.
Apply that rule to the case, and it is clear, even if there be
a class of State regulations which may be valid until the same
ground is occupied by an act of Congress or by a treaty, that
the State regulation in question is not one of that class.
Such a subject is in its nature national, and admits of only
one uniform system or plan of regulation. Unless the system
or plan of regulation is uniform, it is impossible of fulfilment.
Mississippi may require the steamer carrying passengers to
provide two cabins and tables for passengers, and may make it
a penal offence for white and colored persons to be mixed in
the same cabin or at the same table. If Louisiana may pass
a law forbidding such steamer from having two cabins and two
tables, - one for white and the other for colored persons, - it
must be admitted that Mississippi may pass a law requiring all
passenger steamers entering her ports to have separate cabins
VOL. v.

32

HALL v. DECUIR.

[Slip. Ct.

and tables, and make it penal for white and colored persons tc
be accommodated in the same cabin or to be furnished with
meals at the same table. Should State legislation in that
regard conflict, then the steamer must cease to navigate between ports of the States having such conflicting legislation, or
must be exposed to penalties at every trip.
Those who framed the Constitution never intended that
navigation, whether foreign or among the States, should be
exposed to such conflicting legislation; and it was to save those
who follow that pursuit from such exposure and embarrassment
that the power to regulate such commerce was vested exclusively in Congress.
Few or none will deny that the power to regulate commerce
among the several States is vested exclusively in Congress; and
it is equally well settled that Congress has, in many instances
and to a wide extent, legislated upon the subject. Sherlock v.
Alling, 93 U. S. 99; Rev. Stat., sect. 4311.
Support to that proposition, of the most persuasive and convincing character, is found in the act of Congress entitled "An
Act to provide for the better security of life on board of vessels propelled in whole or in part by steam, and for other
purposes," the forty-first section of which provides that all
steamers navigating the lakes, bays, inlets, sounds, rivers, harbors, or other navigable waters of the United States, when such
waters are common highways of commerce or open to general
or competitive navigation, shall be subject to the provisions of
that act. 16 Stat. 453; Rev. Stat., sect. 4400.
Vessels have always been employed to a greater or less extent
in the transportation of passengers, and have never been supposed to be on that account withdrawn from the control or
protection of Congress. Gibbon&v. Ogden, supra.
Differences of opinion may exist as to the extent and operation of the national law regulating commerce among the several
States, but none, it is presumed, will venture to deny that it
is regulated very largely by congressional legislation. Admit
that, and it follows that the legislation of Congress, if constitutional, must supersede all State legislation upon the same, and,
by necessary implication, prohibit it, except in cases where
the legislation of Congress manifests an intention to leave

Oct 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIR.

some particular matter to be regulated by the several States.
Cooley v. Board of IWardens, supra.
Decisive authority for that proposition is found in the unquestioned decisions of this court. Such were the views of
Judge Story more than thirty-five years ago, when he said, if
Congress have a constitutional power to regulate a particular
subject, and they do actually regulate it in a given manner and
in a certain form, it cannot be that the State legislatures have
a right to interfere, and, as it were, by way of complement to
the legislation of Congress, to prescribe additional regulations
and what they may deem auxiliary provisions for the same purpose. The Chusan, 2 Story, 46C ; Sinnot v. Davenport,22 How.
227.
In such a case, the legislation of Congress in what it does
prescribe manifestly indicates that it does not intend that there
shall be any further legislation to act upon the subject-matter.
Its silence as to what it does not do is as expressive of what
its intention is as the direct provisions made by it. Prggv.
Penn.sylvania, 16 Pet. 589 ; Gibbons v. Ogden, supra; White's
Bank v. Smith, supra.
Whenever the terms in which a power is granted to Congress,
or the nature of the power, requires that it should be exercised
exclusively by Congress, the subject is as completely taken
from the State legislatures as if they had been expressly forbidden to exercise the power. Sturges v. Crowninshield,4 Wheat.
122; Brown v. Mlaryland, 12 id. 419.
Irrespective of the decisions of the State court, it might well
be doubted whether the State statute in question doels prohibit
a steamer carrying passengers from having and maintaining
separate cabins and eating-saloons for white and colored
passengers, and whether the denial to a colored female of a
passage in the cabin assigned to white female passengers is a
denial of equal rights and privileges, within the meaning of the
State Constitution or the first section of the State statute in
question, provided the applicant was offered a passage in the
lower cabin, with equally convenient accommodation. Much
discussion of that topic, however, is unnecessary, as two decisions of the State court conclusively determine the point that
the State statute does contain such a prohibition, and that the

facts of the case do bring the conduct of the defendant within
that prohibition. -DeCuir v. Benson, 27 La. Ann. I; Tart v.
HToss & Elder, 22 id. 517; Sauvinet v. Walker, 27 id. 14.
Even suppose the meaning of the statute is doubtful, still
the rule of construction adopted by the highest court of a State,
in construing their own Constitution and one of their own statutes, in a case not involving any question re-examinable in this
court under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, must be
regarded as conclusive in this court. Provident Institution v.
.Massachusetts,6 Wall. 611; Randall v. Brigham, 7 id. 528:
Gut v. The State, 9 id. 85.
Where a State court gi%es such a construction to a State
statute as to make it conflict with the Constitution or laws
of the United States, and sustains its validity after giving it
such construction, and thereby deprives a party of his rights
under the said Constitution or law, it is settled law that a Federal question does arise in such a case, and that this court can
review the decision of the State court as to the validity of such
a statute. Insurance Company v. Treasurer,11 id. 204. Were
it not so, it is clear that the constitutional provision could
always be evaded by the State courts giving such a construction to the contract or the statute as to render the appellate
power of this court of no avail in such cases to uphold the
contract against unfriendly State legislation. Delmas v. Insurance Company, 14 id. 661.
State courts certainly have a right to expound the statutes
of the State ; and, having done so, those statutes, with the interpretation 'given to them by the highest court of the State,
become the rule of decision in the Federal courts. Richmond
v. Smith, 15 id. 429; Jones &' Co. v. The City of Richmond,
18 Gratt. (Va.) 517; Leffingwell v. Warren, 2 Black, 599.
Argument to show that the question whether or not the
State court erred in the construction of their own Constitution
and statute is not re-examinable in this court under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act is unnecessary, as the negative
of the proposition is self-evident.
Governed by the laws of Congress, it is clear that a steamer
carrying passengers may have separate cabins and dining
saloons for white persnns and persons of color, for the plain

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIR.

reason that the laws of Congress contain nothing to prohibit
such an arrangement. Steamers carrying passengers for hire
are bound, if they have suitable accommodation, to take all
who apply, unless there is objection to the character or conduct
of the applicant. Applicants to whom there is no such valid
objection have a right to a passage, but it is not an unlimited
right. On the contrary, it is subject to such reasonable regulations as the proprietors may prescribe for the due accommodation of passengers and the due arrangement of the business
of the carrier.
Such proprietors have not only that right, but the farther
right to consult and provide for their own interests in the
management of the vessel as a common incident to their right
of property. They are not bound to admit passengers on
board who refuse to obey the reasonable regulations of the
vessel, or who are guilty of gross and vulgar habits of conduct,
or who make disturbances on board, or whose characters are
doubtful, dissolute, suspicious, or unequivocally bad. Nor are
they bound to admit passengers on board whose object it is to
interfere with the interests of the patronage of the proprietors,
so as to make their business less lucrative or their management
less acceptable to the public. Jeneks v. Coleman, 2 Sumn.
221.
Corresponding views are expressed by the Supreme Court
of Michigan in an analogous case, in which the distinction between the right of an applicant to be admitted on board, and
his claim to dictate what part of the vessel he shall occupy, is
clearly pointed out. Referring to that subject, the court say
the right to be carried is one thing, and the privilege of a passenger on board as to what part of the vessel may be occupied
by him is another and a very different thing; and they add, that
it is the latter and not the former which is subject to reasonable
rules and regulations, and is, where such rules and regulations
exist, to be determined by the proprietors. Damages were
claimed in that case for refusing the plaintiff the privilege of
the cabin; but the court held that the refusal was nothing more
or less than denying him certain accommodations from which he
was excluded by the rules and regulations of the steamer. Day
v. Owen, 5 Iich. 520.

HALL v. DEOuIn.

[Sup. Or.

Proprietors of the kind may make rules and regulations, but
they must be reasonable; and the court held in that case that
to be so they should have for their object the accommodation
of the passengers, including every thing to render the transportation most comfortable and least annoying, not to one or
two or any given number carried at any particular tinie, but
to the great majority ordinarily transported; and they also
held that such rules and regulations should be of a permanent nature, and not be made for a particular occasion or emergency.
Special and important duties indubitably' are imposed upon
carriers of passengers for the benefit of the travelling public,
but it must not be forgotten that the vehicles and vessels which
such carriers use do not belong to the public. They are private
property, the use and enjoyment of which belong to the proprietors. Angell, Carriers (5th ed.), sect. 525.
Concede what is undoubtedly true, that the use and employment of such vehicles and vessels, during the time they are
allowed the privileges of common carriers, may be subjected to
such conditions and obligations as the nature of their employment requires for the comfort, security, and safety of passengers, still the settled rules of constitutional law forbid that a
State legislature may invade the dominion of private right by
arbitrary restrictions, requirements, or limitations, by which
the property of the owners or possessors would be virtually
stripped of all utility or value if bound to- comply with the
regulations. Jencks v. Coleman., supra.
Both steamboats and railways are modern modes of conveyance; but Shaw, C. J., decided that the rules of the common law
were applicable to them, as they take the place of other modes
of carrying passengers, and he held that they have authority
to make reasonable and suitable regulations as regards passengers
intending to pass and repass in their vehicles or vessels. Commonwealth v. Power, 7 M&tc. (Mass.) 601; ifibbardv. New York
J .Erie Railroad Co., 15 N. Y. 455; Illinois Central Railroad
Co. v. Whittemore, 43 Ill. 420. They are, said the Chief Justice
in that case, in a condition somewhat similar to that of an innkeeper, whose premises are open to all guests. Yet he is not
only empowered to make such proper arrangements as will pro-

mote his own interests, but he is bound to regulate his house
so as to preserve order, and, if practicable, prevent breaches
of the peace. Vinton v. Middlesex Railroad Co., 11 Allen
(Mass.), 304.
Cases of like import are quite numerous, and the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania decided directly that a public carrier
may separate passengers in his conveyance; and they deduce
his power to do so from his right of private property in the
means of conveyance, and the necessity which arises for such a
regulation to promote the public interest. Speaking to that
point, they say that the private means the carrier uses belong
wholly to himself; and they held the right of control in that
regard as necessary to enable the carrier to protect his own
interests, and to perform his duty to the travelling public. His
authority in that regard, as that court holds, arises from his
owmership of the property, and his public duty to promote the
comfort and enjoyment of those travelling in his conveyance.
Guided by those views, the court held that it is not an unreasonable regulation to seat passengers so as to preserve order and
decorum, and to prevent contacts and collisions arising from
natural or well-known customary repuguancies which are likely
to breed disturbances, where white and colored persons are
huddled together without their consent. The West Chester .
PhiladelphiaRailroad Co. v. Miles, 55 Pa. St. 209.
Where the passenger embarks without making any special
contract, and without knowledge as to what accommodations
will be afforded, the law implies a contract which obliges the
carrier to furnish suitable accommodations according to the room
at his disposal; but the passenger in such a case is not entitled
to any particular apartments or special accommodations. Substantial equality of right is the law of the State and of the
United States; but equality does not mean identity, as in the
nature of things identity in the accommodation afforded to passengers, whether colored or white, is impossible, unless our
commercial marine shall undergo an entire change. Adult
male passengers are never allowed a passage in the ladies' cabin,
nor can all be accommodated, if the company is large, in the
state-rooms. Passengers are entitled to proper diet and lodging;
but the laws of the United States do not require the master of

HALL

V. D.Cumr.

[Sup. Ct.

a steamer to put persons in the same apartment who would be
repulsive or disagreeable to each other.
Steamers carrying passengers as a material part of their
employment are common carriers, and as such enjoy the rights
and are subject to the duties and obligations of such carriers;
but there was and is not any law of Congress which forbids
such a carrier from providing separate apartments for his passengers. What the passenger has a right to require is such
accommodation as he has contracted for, or, in the absence of
any special contract, such suitable accommodations as the room
and means at the disposal of the carrier enable him to supply;
and in locating his passengers in apartments and at their meals
it is not only the right of the master, but his duty, to exercise
such reasonable discretion and control as will promote, as far
as practicable, the comfort and convenience of his whole company.
Questions of a kindred character have arisen in several of
the States, which support these views in a course of reasoning
entirely satisfactory and conclusive. Boards of education were
created by a law of the State of Ohio, and they were authorized
to establish within their respective jurisdictions one or more
separate schools for colored children when the whole numbei
by enumeration exceeds twenty, and when such schools will
afford them, as far as practicable, the advantages and privileges
of a common-school education. Under that law, colored children were not admitted as a matter of right into the schools
for white children, which gave rise to contest, in which the
attempt was made to set aside the law as unconstitutional: but
the Supreme Court of the State held that it worked no substantial inequality of school privileges between the children of
the two classes in the locality of the parties; thai equality of
rights does not involve the necessity of educatinj white and
colored persons in the same school any more than ,t does that
of educating children of both sexes in the same sc)- iol, or that
different grades of scholars must be kept in the sE -ue school;
and that any classification which preserves substar- ally equal
school advantages is not prohibited by either the Stte or Federal Constitution, nor would it contravene the pr -visions of
either. State v. JfeCann et al., 21 Ohio St. 198.

Oct. 1877.]

HALL V. DECUm.

Separate primary schools for colored and for white children
were maintained in the city of Boston. Children in the State
who are unlawfully excluded from public-school instruction
may recover damages therefor against the city or town by
which such public instruction is supported. It appears that
the plaintiff was denied admission to the primary school for
white children, and she by her next friend claimed damages
for the exclusion; but the Supreme Court, Shaw, C. J., giving
the opinion, held that the law vested the power in the com..
mittee to regulate the system of distribution and classification,
and that when the power was reasonably exercised their decision must be deemed conclusive. Distinguished counsel insisted that the separation tended to deepen and perpetuate the
odious distinction of caste; but the court responded, that they
were not able to say that the decision was not founded on just
grounds of reason and experience, and in the results of a discriminating and honest judgment. Roberts v. City of Boston,
5 Cush. (Mass.) 198.
Age and sex have always been marks of classification in
public schools throughout the history of our country, and the
Supreme Court of Nevada well held that the trustees of the
public schools in that State might send colored children to one
school and white children to another, or they might make any
such classification as they should deem best, whether based on
age, sex, race, or any other reasonable existent condition. State
v. -Duffy, 7 Nev. 342.
Directors of schools in Iowa have no discretion under the
existing law of the State to deny a youth of proper age admission to any particular school on account of nationality, color,
or religion. Former statutes of the State invested the directors
with such discretion, and it is impliedly conceded that it would
be competent for the legislature again to confer that authority.
Clark v. The Board of -Directors,24 Iowa, 266.
School privileges are usually conferred by statute, and, as
such, are subject to such regulations as the legislature may
prescribe. Such statutes generally provide for equal school
advantages for all children, classifying the scholars as the legislature in its wisdom may direct or authorize; and the Supreme
Court of New York decided that the legislature of the State

HALL V. DECUIR.

[Sup. Ct.

may from time to time make such limitations and alterations
in that regard as they may see fit. Dallas v. Fosdick, 40 How.
(N. Y.) Pr. 249.
Public instruction of the kind is regulated in that State oy
official boards created for the purpose; and it is settled law
there that the board may assign a particular school for colored
children, and exclude them from schools assigned for white
children, and that such a regulation is not in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. People v. Gaston, 13 Abb. (N. Y.)
Pr. w. s. 160.
Ships and vessels duly enrolled and licensed for the coasting
trade may lawfully touch at intermediate ports, to receive or
discharge passengers or cargo; but the fact that they do so does
not in the least change or alter the character of the trip, or
-diminish the right of the vessel to enjoy all the privileges of a
vessel engaged in commerce between ports in different States;
nor does the fact that the plaintiff expected to leave the
steamer at a landing in the same State enlarge her right of
accommodation, or augment in any respect the obligations of the
steamer as a public carrier, for the reason that the steamer
sailed throughout the whole trip under her coasting license,
and her rights and privileges, duties and obligations, must be
ascertained and defined by the regulations prescribed by the
acts of Congress.
Commercial regulations of the kind cannot be effectual to
accomplish the object for which they were required and designed to effect, unless it be held that they extend to the entire
voyage, as well that portion of it which is in the State where
the voyage began as that which extends into another State,
as the whole is performed under the coasting license founded
in the acts of Congress passed to regulate such commerce and
navigation.
Throughout our history the acts of Congress have regulated
the enrolment and license of vessels to be engaged in the
coasting trade, and this court expressly determined that a State
law which imposed another and an additional condition to the
privilege of carrying on that trade within her waters is inoperative and void. Sinnot v. -Davenport,22 How. 227; Foster v.
Davenport, 22 id. 244; Wheeling Bridge Company v. Pennsylvania, 18 id. 432.

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DEOUIR.

Alabama passed an act to the effect that vessels engaged in
foreign commerce, or in the coasting trade, shall not navigate
her waters without complying with a condition not prescribed
by the act of Congress. By the State law, they are required,
before leaving the described port, to file in the office of the
judge of probate a statement in writing, setting forth as follows: 1. The name of the vessel. 2. The name of the owner
or owners. 3. His or their place or places of residence. 4. The
interest each has in the vessel.
Speaking of that condition, the court say, if the interpretation of the court as to the force and effect of the privileges
afforded to the vessel by the enrolment and license act in the
leading case are to be maintained, it can require no argument
to show a direct conflict between this act and the act of Congress regulating the coasting trade.
Sinnot v. Davenport,
supra.
Nor does it require any argument to show that the State law
before the court is exactly analogous in principle to the State
law declared void in that case. Like the former, the latter
imposes an additional condition to the privilege of carrying on
the coasting trade within the waters of the State, not prescribed
by any act of Congress. Enrolled and licensed vessels have
the constitutional right to pursue the coasting trade on the
terms and conditions which Congress has seen fit to prescribe,
and no State legislature can interfere with that right, either to
abridge or enlarge it, or to subject it to any terms and conditions whatsoever.
Commerce among the several States as well as commerce
with foreign nations requires uniformity of regulation; and
that power is by the Constitution vested exclusively in Congress, as appears by the Constitution itself, and by an unbroken
course of the decisions of this court, covering a period of more
than half a century.
Judicial authority to support the theory of the court below
is entirely wanting, except what may be derived from the case
of Coger v. Packet Company, 87 Iowa, 145, decided by the
Supreme Court of the State. Special damage was claimed by
the plaintiff in that case, of the master of a steamer navigating
the Mississippi River, for removing her, she being a colored

HALL V. DEOUIR.

[Sup. Ct.

woman, from the dining-room of the steamer without just
cause. Regulations had previously been adopted by the steamer
excluding colored persons from the state-rooms and other firstclass privileges and accommodations. Service was made, and
the defendant appeared and pleaded those regulations as a
defence. Hearing was had, and the court decided that persons
of color were entitled to the same rights and privileges, when
travelling, as white persons, and that they cannot be required
by any rule or custom based on distinction of color or race to
accept other or different accommodations than those furnished
to white persons.
Abundant reasons exist to show that the decision in that
case is not an authority in the case before the court, a few of
-which will be stated: 1. Because the report of the case does
not show that the steamer was navigating under a coasting
license. 2. Because the constitutional question involved in the
case before the court was neither involved, presented, nor considered in that case, either by the bar or the court. 3. Because
the decision was rested entirely upon other and different
grounds. 4. Because the facts of the two cases are widely
and substantially different.
Colored persons, it is admitted, are citizens, and that citizens,
without distinction of race or color or previous condition of
servitude, have the same right to make and enforce contracts,
to sue, be parties and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease,
sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full
and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security
of personal property, as is enjoyed by white citizens. 14 Stat.
27. States are also forbidden to make or enforce any law
which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens
of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws. Enforcement Act, 16 id. 140; Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
Vague reference is made to the Civil Rights Act and to the
preceding amendment to the Constitution, as if that act or
the said amendment may supersede the operation and legal
effect of the coasting license as applied to the case before the

Oct. 1.877.]

HALL V. DECUM.

court ; but it is clear that neither of those provisions, nor both
combined, were intended to accomplish any such purpose.
Enough appears in the language employed in those provisions
to show that their principal object was to confer citizenship,
and the rights which belong to citizens as such, upon the colored people, and in that manner to abrogate the rule previously
adopted by this court in the Dred Scott Case. By the Civil
Rights Act, the rule adopted in that case is entirely superseded,
and all the substantial rights of citizens are conferred upon the
colored people, as more fully appears by the enumeration contained in the first section of the act. Under no view, therefore,
that can properly be taken of that act can it be held to supersede, repeal, modify, or affect the act of Congress, providing
for the enrolment and licensing of ships and vessels for the
coasting trade. Dallas v. Fosdick, supra.
Certain phases of the question were also presented to the
District Court of Philadelphia, in the case of Goinesv. M' Candless, 4 Phila. C. P. 255, in which the court admitted that a
corporation created for the carriage of passengers cannot arbitrarily refuse to carry any man or class of men without laying
itself open to an action for damages; but the court held in the
same case that such a corporation may establish reasonable
rules for the comfort and convenience of those whom it is
bound to carry, even though the effect may be to exclude particular individuals falling within those rules.
Evidence of a decisive character that Congress has regulated
inter-state commerce is also found in the act supplemental to
the act providing for the enrolment and licensing of ships
and vessels for the coasting trade, the first section of which
divides the sea-coasts and navigable rivers into three great
districts, and provides as follows: 1. That the first shall include all the collection districts on the sea-coast and navigable
rivers between the limits of the United States and the southern
limits of Georgia. 2. That the second shall include all the
collection districts and navigable rivers between the river Perdido and the Rio Grande. 3. That the third shall include all
the collection districts on the sea-coast and navigable rivers
between the southern limits of Georgia and the river Perdido.
Rev. Stat., sect. 4348; 3 Stat. 493.

HALL v. DECuIr.

[Sup. Ct

Congress having legislated upon the subject, it cannot be
that the State legislatures have a right to interfere and prescribe additional regulations, as the legislation of Congress
clearly indicates that the national law-makers never intended
to leave any lhing open upon the subject to the discretion of
the State legislatures.
Two opposing theories, sometimes advanced in such controversies, deserve some brief comments before concluding the
examination of the case. They are in substance and effect as
follows: 1. That the effect of the coasting license issued under
the enrolment act is merely to evidence the national character
of the vessel; that the acts of Congress requiring the register
and enrolment of vessels was never intended as the exercise
of the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the
States, and that the States still possess the concurrent power
to prescribe such regulations until Congress shall ordain express provisions to control and restrict the regulations enacted
by the States. 2. That the Supreme Court, by a decision made
subsequent to the decree in the great leading case in which it
is held that the power to regulate commerce is vested exclu-sively in Congress, qualified, if they did not positively overrule,
that generally acknowledged rule upon the subject.
1. Enough, it would seem, has already been remarked to
refute the first opposing theory; but, if more be needed, it will
be found in the fact that it is the exact theory maintained by
the courts of the State where the controversy arose, and whose
final decree was removed into this court for re-examination.
None will attempt to deny that proposition who ever read the
opinions delivered in the subordinate courts. Ogden v. Gibbons,
4 Johns. (N. Y.) Ch. 150; s. c. 17 Johns. 488; 1 Kent Com.
(12th ed.) 485.
Explanations respecting that historical controversy, of a
more satisfactory character, are given by Chancellor Kent than
by any other legal writer who has undertaken to state the
constitutional questions which it involved, and which were
finally determined by the unanimous judgment of this court.
His statement of the ease is as follows: That the respondent
set up, by way of right and title to navigate the waters of the
State in opposition to the grant of the complainant, that his

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECum.

steamboats were duly enrolled and licensed under the enrolment act, to be employed in carrying on the coasting trade;
that the question in the case was whether such a coasting
license conferred the power to interfere with the grant of the
State under which the complainant claimed the exclusive right
to navigate the waters of the State which made the grant.
Eminent counsel represented both sides of the question, and
we are informed by the ]earned commentator that the courts
of the State in the two cases referred to decided against the
defence set up in the answer of the respondent, and held that
the coasting license merely gave to the steamboats of the respondent the character of American vessels; that the license
was not intended to decide a question of property, or to confer
a right of property or a right of navigation or commerce; that
the courts of that State during that period never regarded the
act regulating the coasting trade as intended to assert any
supremacy over State regulations in respect to internal waters
or commerce, for the reason that those courts did not consider
that act as the exercise of the power vested in Congress to
regulate commerce among the States.
Competent evidence to show that the courts of that State
in those two cases took the exact same ground as that involved
in the theory in question is very abundant and conclusive,
without looking elsewhere than to the lecture of the Chancellor
under consideration. Decisive support to that conclusion is
also found in what follows in the same connection in the same
lecture, in which he says that the courts of the State did not,
either in the case of Ogden v. Cibbons or in any of the cases
which preceded it, deny to Congress the power to regulate
commerce among the States by express and direct provision,
so as to control and restrict the exercise of the State grant;
that they only insisted that without some such explicit provision the State jurisdiction over the subject was in full force,
which is exactly what is claimed by those who seek to undermine the doctrines of the great leading case.
Beyond all question, the views of the Chancellor as to what
was decided by the courts of the State in that great controversy
are correct, and it will be equally instructing to ascertain what
his views are as to what followed in this court. Speaking

HALL v. DECUM.

[Sup. t

upon that subject, he says the cause was afterwards carried up
by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, where
the decree was reversed on the ground that the grant to the
complainant was repugnant to the rights and privileges conferred upon the steamboats of the respondent navigating under
a coasting license; that in the construction of the power to
regulate commerce the Supreme Court held that the term
meant not only traffic but intercourse, and that it included
navigation, and that the power to regulate commerce was a
power to regulate navigation; that commerce among the several States meant commerce intermingled with the States, and
which might pass the external boundary line of each State,
and be introduced into the interior; that the power conferred
comprehended navigation within the limits of every State, and
that it may pass the jurisdictional line of a State and be exercised within its territory, so far as the navigation is connected
with foreign commerce or with commerce among the several
States; and that the power, like all the other powers of Congress, is plenary and absolute within its acknowledged limits.
Three limitations or restrictions, as the Chancellor states,
were admitted by the Supreme Court in that case to exist to
the limits of that power as conferred: 1. That the power does
not extend to that commerce which is completely internal, and
is carried on between different parts of the same State, not
extending to or affecting other States. 2. That the power is
restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than
one, the completely internal commerce of a State being reserved for the State itself. 3. That the power conferred does
not prohibit the States from passing inspection laws or quarantine or health laws and laws for regulating highways and
ferries, nor does it include the power to regulate the purely
internal commerce of a State, or to act directly on its system
of police. 1 Kent Com. (12th ed.) 437.
Many efforts have been made to analyze and expound the
opinion delivered by the great magistrate in that case, but
none, it is believed, were ever attended with such complete
success as that of the commentator to which reference is made.
He was the chancellor of the State court, and gave the original
opinion; and, when he found that his decree was reversed by

Oct. 1877.]

HALL v. DECUIP.

the Supreme Court, he was influenced by the highest motive
to ascertain the true grounds assumed in the judgment of the
Appellate Court.
Judge Story says, in his Commentaries on the Constitution,
that it has been settled, upon the most solemn deliberation, that
the power to regulate commerce is exclusive in the government
of the United States; and he adds in another section of the
Commentaries, that the reasoning by which the power given
to Congress to regulate commerce is maintained to be exclusive
has not of late been seriously controverted, and that it seems
to have the cheerful acquiescence of the learned tribunals of a
particular State, one of whose acts brought it first under judicial examination. 2 Story, Const. (3d ed.), sects. 1067, 1071;
Steamboat Company v. Livingston, 3 Cow. (N. Y.) 13 ; The Peopie v. Brooks, 4 Denio (N. Y.), 469; Pomeroy, Const. (3d ed.),
sect. 371; Sergeant, Const. (2d ed.) 308; Rawle, Const. (2d ed.)
82; Bailroad Company v. H~usen, supra, p. 465.
Repeated decisions of this court, including the one at the
present term, have established that rule as the settled law of
the court; nor is there any case in the reported decisions of the
court, when properly understood, which gives any countenance
or support to the theory under examination, unless it be the
case of Gilman v. Philadelphia,3 Wall. 713, which it is not
admitted, when taken as a whole, falls within that category.
Certain admissions are contained in the opinion in that case
which are certainly in conflict with the theory which # is the
purpose of these observations to refute. Mr. Justice Swayne
very properly admits that the enrolment act authorizes vessels
enrolled and licensed according to its provisions to engage in
the coasting trade; that commerce includes navigation; and
that the power to regulate commerce comprehends the control,
for that purpose and to the extent necessary, of the navigable
waters of the United States which are accessible from a State
other than those in which they lie. For that purpose, says the
same learned judge, they are the public property of the nation,
and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra; Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. 371.
These are the authorities cited to support the proposition;
and the learned Justice adds, that this necessarily includes the
VoL. v.

33

power to keep such waters open and free from any obstruction
to their navigation interposed by the States or otherwise, to
remove such obstructions when they exist, and to provide by
such sanctions as they, the Congress, may deem proper against
the occurrence of the evil and for the punishment of offenders.
For these purposes, Congress, says the judge, possesses all the
powers which existed in the States before the adoption of the
national Constitution, and which have always been vested in
the Parliament of England: and he further added, that commerce among the States does not stop at a -State line; that,
coming from abroad, it penetrates wherever it can find navigable waters reaching from without into the interior, and may
follow them up as far as navigation is practicable. Wherever
commerce among the States goes, the power of the nation goes
with it, to protect and enforce its rights. Nothing more surely
can be needed to show that the theory under discussion is
erroneous and fallacious.
2. Whatever support exists to the second theory mentioned
is found in a single case, which has sometimes been strangely
misunderstood at the bar. Willson v. Blackbird Creek Marsh
Co., 2 Pet. 245. Proper attention to the facts of the case will
show that the creek in question was one of those many creeks
passing through a deep level marsh adjoining the river Delaware, up which the tide flows for some distance; that the
property on the bank of the creek was of little or no value
unless i was reclaimed by excluding the water from the marsh;
and that the health of the residents of the neighborhood re4uired that such improvement should be made. Measures
calculated to effect those objects had been adopted; and the
court held that the State legislature might lawfully authorize
the necessary erections to accomplish those important objects.
Judgment was rendered by the same court which gave the
judgment in the case of Gibbons v. Ogden; and no one has
ever been able to assign any reason to conclude that the constitutional views of the court bad at that time undergone any
change. Instead of overruling that great case, it will be seen
that the Chief Justice who gave the opinion did not even
allude to it; though, as a sound exposition of the Federal Constitution, it is not second in point of importance to any one

that great magistrate ever delivered. Evidently he had no
occasion to refer to it or to any of its doctrines, as he properly
described the creek over which the dam was erected as a low,
sluggish water, of little or no importance, and treated the
erection of the dam as one adapted to reclaim the adjacent
marshes, and as essential to the preservation of the public
health, and sustained the constitutionality of the law authorizing the erection, upon the ground that it was within the
reserved police powers of the State.
Congressional regulations, as embodied in the enrolment
act and other acts of Congress, apply to all public navigable
waters of the United States; but every navigator employed in
the coasting trade knows that there are many small creeks,
channels, and indentations along our Atlantic coast, especially
in the marshes, which are never classed in the category of
public navigable waters, though they are capable of being
navigated by small vessels when the tide is full. Hundreds of
such creeks, said Mr. Justice McLean, are similarly situated.
In such cases, involving doubt whether the jurisdiction may
not be exclusively exercised by the State, it is politic and
proper in the judicial tribunals of the nation to follow the
action of Congress.
Over the navigable waters of a State Congress can exercise
no commercial power, except as regards the intercourse with
other States or foreign countries; and he adds, that doubtless
there are many creeks made navigable by the flowing of the
tide or by the back water from large rivers which the general
phraseology of an act to regulate commerce may not embrace;
that in all such cases, and many others that may be found to
exist, this court could not safely exercise a jurisdiction not
expressly sanctioned by Congress.
When the language of the court in that case is applied to
the facts of the case, said Justice McLean, no such principle
as that assumed in argument is sanctioned; that the construction of the dam was not complained of as a regulation of corn
merce, but as an obstruction to commerce; that the court held,
that, inasmuch as Congress had not assumed to control State
legislation over those small navigable creeks into which the
tide flows, the judicial power could not do so ; that the act of

the State was an internal and a police power to guard the
health of its citizens, and that nothing more was found in the
case than a forbearance to exercise power over a doubtful
object, which should ever characterize the judicial branch of
the-government. Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283.
Mr. Hamilton, in the thirty-first number of the Federalist,
says that there is an exclusive delegation or alienation of State
sovereignty in three cases: first, where the exclusive power is
in terms given to Congress; second, where an authority is
granted to the Union, and the States are prohibited from exercising a like authority; third, where an authority is granted
to the Union, to which a similar authority in the States would
be absolutely and wholly contradictory and repugnant.
Even suppose that the power to regulate commerce falls
within the third designation, still it is believed that sufficient
has already been remarked to show that the nature of the
power is such that it shows that the power should be exclusively exercised by Congress. Cooley v. Board of Wardens,
12 How. 299; State v. The Wheeling Bridge Company, 13 How.
518; s. c. 18 id. 421.
Both of the decisions in the Wheeling Bridge case are subsequent in point of time to the case of Wlison v. The .Backbird
Creek Marsh Co., and so are the Commentaries of Judge Story
upon the Constitution; and yet not an intimation is found in
either that the doctrines of the great case referred to were
ever modified or questioned. That such an intimation is not
to be found anywhere is clearly demonstrated by a recent
commentator, who has carefully reviewed every opinion given
by this court upon that subject. Pomeroy, Const. (3d ed.),
pp. 207-248.
Waters lying wholly within a single State may be such as
to be regarded as public navigable waters of the United States,
because they are properly denominated as arms of the sea.
Examples of the kind are numerous, of which it will be sufficient to mention the Hudson, f4"om Albany to the sound; the
Penobscot, from Bangor to the bay; the Kennebec, from the
capital of the State to its mouth; and the Saco, from below
the falls to the ocean; and many others, equally well known
even to the pupils in the common schools. All such public

navigable waters, being arms of the sea, are within the acts
of Congress passed to regulate commerce. The Propeller Commeree, 1 Black, 574; The BTelfast, 7 Wall. 624; Gilman v. Philadelphia, 3 id. 713.

3. It was an unalterable condition of the admission of Wisconsin into the Union,
that, of the public lands in the State, section 16 in every township, which
had not been sold or otherwise disposed of, should be granted to her for the
use of schools.
2. Whether the compact with the State constituted only a pledge of a grant in
faturo, or operated to transfer to her the sections as soon as they could be
identified by the public surveys, the lands embraced within them were set
apart from the public domain, and could not be subsequently diverted from
their appropriation to the State. If any further assurance of title was required, the United States was bound to provide for the execution of proper
instruments transferring to the State the naked fee, or to adopt such other
legislation as would secure that result.
3. The right of the Menomonee Indians to their lands in Wisconsin was only that
of occupancy; and, subject to that right, the State was entitled to every section 16 within the limits of those lands.
. The act of Congress approved Feb. 6, 1871 (16 Stat. 404), authorizing a sale of
the townships set apart for the use of the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians,
and originally forming a part of the lands of the Menomonees, does not apply
to sections 16.

This was replevin by Beecher to recover from Wetherby,
James, and Stille, saw-logs, cut and taken by'them during the
winter of 1872 and 1873, from section 16, township 28, range 1
east, in Wisconsin. The plaintiff asserts title to the land under
patents from the United States bearing date Oct. 10, 1872; and
the defendants, under patents from that State of Dec. 15, 1865,
and Sept. 26, 1870.
Under the eighth article of the treaty of Aug. 19, 1825,
7 Stat. 272, the Menomonee lands were declared to be "bounded
on the north by the Chippewa country, on the East by Green
Bay and Lake Michigan, extending as far south as Milwaukee
River, and on the West they claim to Black River." The
lands in question are embraced i. this tract.
