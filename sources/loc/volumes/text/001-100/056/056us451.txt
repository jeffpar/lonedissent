APPELLANTS, V.

Where the re-pondent in a chancery suit in the Circuis Court took two grounds of
defenice, and the judge,' in giving his reasons for a decree dismissing the bill, upon
one ctf the two grounds, expressed his opinion that the respondent had not established
the other ground, he cannot appeal from this as a part of the decree.
The decree as in the respondent's favor, dismissing the bill with costs, and no appeal
lis from an opinion expresed by the judge upon the facts of the case, not affecting
the decree.
Mlorover, the decree complained of has already been argued before this court upon
the appeal of the other party, and both grounds of defence decided to be insufficient, and the decree roversed. There is, therefore, no such decree as that appealed
from.
Besid',, the court below has not acted upon the mandate and entered a final decree;
therefore there iLno final decree to appeal from.

THis was an appeal from the Cheuit Court of the United
States for the Northern District of New York, sitting as a court
of equity.
It was a branch of the case of Troy Iron and Nail Factory v.
Corning et al. reported in 14 How. 193. The decree of the Circuit Court, now appealed from, is given at page 194. The bill
was originally filed by the Troy Iron and Nail Factory against
Corning et al. and the Circuit Court dismissed the bill, but this
court reversed that decree. By reference to page 194, 14 Howard, it will be seen, that the Circuit Court, in its decree, used the
following language, viz. "And it appearing to the said court
that the said Henry Burden was the first and original inventor

of the improvement on the spike machine in the bill of complaint mentioned, and for which a patent was issued," &c., &c.
Corning et al. being defendants in that suit, and succeeding
in having the bill dismissed, did not appeal from the decree;
but when the appeal was decided against them by this court
as reported in 14 Howard, they entered an appeal from that
part of the decree, which was as follows:
"And that so much or such parts of said decree as declares,
orders, adjudges, and decrees, as follows, to wit: - 'And it appearing to the said court, that the said Hen Burden was the

IN EQUITY.

This cause having been heretofore brought to a hearing upon
the pleadings and proofs, and counsel for the respective parties,
having been heard and due deliberation thereupon had, and it
appearing to the said court that the said Henry Burden was the
first and original inventor of the improvement on the spike ma-.
chine in the bill of complaint mentioned, and for which a patent
was issued to the said Henry Burden, bearing date the 2d S.eptember, 1840, as in said bill of complaint set forth, and that the
said complainants have a full and perfect title to the said patents for said improvements by assignment from the said Henry.
Burden, as is stated and set forth in the said bill of complaint.
But it also :further appearing to the court, on the pleadings and
proofs, that the instrument in writing bearing date the 14th October, 1845, stated and set forth 'An the said bill of complaint, and
also in the answer of the said defendants thereto, entered into
upon a settlement and compromise of certain conflicting claims
between the said parties, and among others of mutual conflicting
claims to the improvements in the spike machine, in said bill
mentioned, and when said instrument was executed by the said
Henry Burden of the one part, and the said defendants of the
other, the said Henry Burden at the time being the patentee
and legal owner of the said improvements, and fully authorized
to settle and adjust the said conflicting claims, did, in legal
effect and by just construction, impart and authorize and convey a right to the defendants to use the said improvements in
the manufacture of the hook-headed spike, without limitation as
to the number of machines so by them to be used, or as to the
place or district in which to be used.
Therefore it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the said
bill of complaint be, and the same is hereby, dismissed, with
costs to be taxed, and that the defendants have execution therefor.
That on the twenty-second day of October, 1850, the said
complainant appealed from the said decree to this court, which
appeal was duly allowed by Mvfr. Justice Nelson, one of the justices of said court, and that afterwards, to wit, in the December
term of this court, 1852, the said cause upon the said appeal
and upon the record returned to this court by the said clerk of

Albany, November 9th, 1853.
SAMUEL STEVENS, Solicitor for Complainants.
To D. L. SEYMOUR, Defendants' Attorney.
Upon this motion to dismiss the appeal, the cause was taken
up.
It was argued by .3i. Stevens and M1r. .Tohnson, for the motion,
and .ilr.Seymour and 31r. Seward against it.
111r. Stevens, in support of the motion to dismiss, made the following points:
The only ordering part of the decree-the only judgment
pronounced by the court below-was a decree dismissing the
complainants' bill, with costs; from that decree the complainants duly appealed to this court, which decree was reversed, and
a decree ordered according to the prayer of the bill, which was
duly entered in the Circuit Court, before the defendants made
the present appeal.
Preceding the ordering part of tne decree, certain recitals
were made by the Circuit Court, showing the reasons or
grounds upon which that court pronounced the ordering part
of the decree.
It is from the recitals preceding tne decree in this cause, And
not from the decree, that this appeal has been made.
The complainants, the respondents to this appeal, now move
to quash or dismiss it upoli the following grounds:

460

SUPREME COURT.
Corning et al. v. The Troy Iron and Nail Factory.

First. This court has appellate jurisdiction only upon appeals
from final judgments or decrees of the Circuit Court. I United
States Statutes at Large, p. 84, § 22.
The ordering part of a decree is the only final decree or judgment of the court.
The preliminary recitals preceding the ordering part of the
decree, is no part of the decree or judgment of the court.
Such recitals are simply the reasons or grounds of the decree.
Those reasons or grounds of the decree cannot be appealed
from. A party might as well claim to appeal from the opinion
of the court, as from a synopsis of the opinion which constitutes
the recitals upon which the ordering part of the decree is based.
The only decree in this case was a decree dismissing the
complainants' bill, with costs. Seaton's Forms of Decrees,
pp. 8, 9.
From the whole of that decree the complainant appealed, the
whole of which decree was reversed by this court at its last term,
an4l the Circuit Court was ordered by the mandate of this court
to enter a decree in said cause, according to the prayer of complainant's bill, and such decree was entered. by the said Circuit
Court, at the June term thereof, 1853, in compliance with said
mandate of this court.
The defendants cannot have that decree of this court reviewed
or altered by an attempt to appeal from the reasons upon which
the Circuit Court pronounced its decree.
Second. But if the recitals preceding the ordering part of the
decree of the Circuit Court could be appealad from, the defendants should have brought a cross appeal, which would be heard
by this court with, and at the same time of, the original appeal,
and one decree only would be pronounced by the .appellate
court. 1 Barbour's Ch. Prac. 397; Uguart's Prac. in House of
Lords on Appeals and Writs of Error, pp. 837-40; Palmer's
Prac. in House of Lords on Appeals and Writs of Error, p. 33;
Hawley v. James, 16 Wend. 85-274; Mapes v. Coffin, 5 Paige's
Rep. 296.
A party cannot have a decree of the Circuit Court reviewed
by this court two, three, or more times, by appealing from dif.
ferent parts of the decree at different times. Every ground
which he might have urged on the hearing of the first appeal,
vsifl be deemed to have been made by him, or if not made,
to have been abandoned. The Santa -Maria, 10 Wheat. Rep.
443-4,; Ex parte Sibbald, 12 Peters's Rep. 488.
This attempt at an appeal by the defendants from the reasons
of the decree, is analogous to an application to this court for a
rehearing upon the original appeal, which is never granted after
the cause has been remitted to the Circuit Court. McArthur
v. Browder 4 Wheat. Rep. 488.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

461.

Corning et al. v. The Troy Iron and Nail Factory.

Third. The decree of the Circuit Court entered in this cause
on the 4th September, 1850, was reversed by this court at its
December term, 1852, and the proceedings were remitted to the
Circuit Court, and that court, at its June term, 1853, entered a
new decree, in pursuance of, and in compliance with, the mandate of this court. Therefore, on the 5th of October, 1853, the
date of defendants' present appeal, there was no -such decree of
the Circuit Court as that entered by said court, of the 4th of
September, 1850, from parts of which the defendants claim to
appeal.
Fourth. The only decree existing in the Circuit Court in this
cause, since its June term, 1853, is an interlocutory, and not a
final decree, and cannot be appealed from. Kane v. Whittick,
8 Wend. Rep. 219; 9 Peters's Rep. 1; 15 Id. 287.
Appeals from the Circuit Court to this court can only be from
final decrees or judgments. 1 United States Statutes at Large,
p. 84, § 22.
MAr. Seymour and Mir. eward opposed the motion to dismiss
the appeal, upon the following grounds:I The decree of the Circuit Court, made on 4th September,
1850, disposed of the whole cause on the merits, and was, therefore, a final decree, and an appeal may -be taken from it. See
act of Congress, March 3, 1803. By this act, an appeal to the
Supreme Court is given "from all final judgments or decrees
rendered, or to be rendered, in any Circuit Court." See also
act 24th February, 1789; the San Pedro, 2 Wheaton, 132; see
act of 1819, (3 United States Statutes at Large, p. 4 8 1, chap. 19) ;
see Patent act of 1836, § 17, (5 United States Statutes at Large,
p. 124); Laws .United States Courts, 117, 118, 119. This last
act enlarges the right of appeal in patent cases. It gives the
court a discretion-to allow the appeal in cases other than those
already provided, for by law. The appeals authorized by this
law are only allowed from a final decree in United States courts.
Patterson v. Gaines and others, 6 Howard, 585.
A decree dismissing a bill is a final decree. 2 Daniel's
Chancery Pleading and Practice, Perkins's ed. pp. 1199, 1200;
McCollum v. Eager, 2 Howard, 64.
The decree, therefore, of the Circuit Court, in this cause, may
be appealed from, under the acts of Congress aforesaid.
II This decree consists of three parts: the introductory part;
the part declaring the rights of the parties, as this does of the
eomplainar Is; and another part ordering or directing a thing or
things to be done. See 2 Daniel's Chancery Pleading and
Tractice, Perlins's ed. pp. 1210 to 1214, as to the forms of decrees. The rules of this court do not allow of recital. See rule

462

SUPREME COURT.
Corning et al. v. The Troy Iron and Nail Factory.

85; so, too, Stat. 3 and 4 William IV., cited in 2 Daniel's Pr.
1212; Seaton's Decrees, 159. It declares the right of complainants to the patent-right, and the right of the defendants to
use the patented machinery, under the agreement of October
14, 1845.
This decree proceeds and adjudges and determines two important matters of defence which had been distinctly set up in
the pleadings, and upon which much testimony had been given,
to vit:
First. "That the said Henry Burden was the first and original
inventor of the improvement on the spike machine in the bill of
complaint, mentiond, and for which a patent was issued to the
said Henry Burden, bearing date the 2d day of September, 1840,
as is in said bill of complaint set forth."
Second. " That the said complainants have a full and perfect
title to the said patents for said improvements, by assignment
from the said Henry Burden, as is stated and set forth in the
said bill of complaint."
These portions of the decree are final decisions on the merits
of the case, giving to the complainants the full and complete
title to the machinery; a vital point, which, if decided for the
defendants, decides the whole case for them; no matter what
maybe the decision as to the agreement o: October 14, 1845.
An appeal will lie from the decision of the Court, upon either
or both of these contested points. 3 Daniel's Ch. Pr. 1606.
III. Even if the adjudication contained in the decree of the
originality of the invention in question, and of the complainants' title to the patent, need not have seen inserted in the
decree, yet they were inserted by the Circuit Court, upon the
special motion of the com plainants, and against the opposition
of the defendants, who should therefore not be prejudiced by it.
See affidavits read on this motion by the defendants.
IV. The appeal by the complainants brought up only the
questions decided to their prejudice. Buckingham v. McLean,
13 Howard, 150, 151.
The equity practice of the Supreme Court of the United
States is regulated by the laws of the U ted States, the rules
of the court, and in the absence of any provision in them applicable to a given case, by the practice of the English High Court

V. The present is the proper time to bring it.
1. The decree of the Circuit Court being final, the laws of
March 3, 1803, and of 1819 and 183B, give an unrestricted and
unqualified right of appeal to either party for five years.
2. Because an appeal now taken from the latter decree would
bring up for review only the proceedings subsequent to the
mandate. The Santa Maria, 10 Wheat. 31; Fx parte Sibbald,
12 Pet. 488.
There is no rule of the Supreme Court adopting the rules of
the House of Lords.
V1 The decision of this court, on the appeal of the complainants, affects only the part of the decree complained of by
them, to wit, the construction of the agieement of October 14,
1845; and, while the declaratory parts of the decree of the
Circuit Court, in favor of the complainants, remain, unreversed,
the right to sustain their bill for a perpetual injunctioni and to
recover damages, followed as a consequence, from the construction given by this court to the agreement of October 14, 1845.
VII. The defendants are entitled to an appeal at some time
within five years from the decision of the Circuit Court against
them, on the validity of the patent in question. Now, if the
complainants' pition is tue, that nothing is appealed from
but the order directing the bill to be dismissed, these defendantf

It is a mere subtlety to say that because the decree, deciding,
the validity of the patent and the title of the complainants in"
their favor, ordered no relief; but, on the contrary, for a difcrthat, therefore,
ent reason, directed their bill to be dismissed,
the decision of the validity of the patent and the title of the
complainants is mere recital, and not a substantial part of the
decree, and proper subject of an appeal. The test is this : Are

Certainly, they are not. But, according to the complainante ,

from that decree so entered on the mandate, the party aggrieved
can review only the proceedings subsequent to that decree, then
it results that th. defendants can have no appeal at all from a
decree in which the material issue upon the invention is found
against them by the court below.
Again. In answer to this, it is said that, on the appeal
brought by the complainants upon the :issue as to a license
found against them, the defendants were at liberty to fall back,
andI contest the issue of the invention found against them; but,
in reply, we say that, by the rules of courts of equity, as well
as by statute, it is optional to the defendants whether they will
so fall back, and contest the issue found against them on the
hearing of the appeal of the complainants,. or whether they will
bring their own distinct appeal.
VIIL The respondents' motion should be denied.
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opinion of the court.
The Troy Iron and Nail Factory filed their bill in the court
below, claiming to be assignees of a patent granted to Henry
Burden, for a "new and useful improvement in the machinery
for manufacturing wrought nails or spikes." The bill charges,
that the appellants, Corning & Company:, have infringed their
patent, and prays for an injunction and an account of -profitb,
&c. The answer of the respondents below took defence on two
grounds - first, that Burden was not the first and original inventor of the machine patented; and, secondly, that the respondents used their machine under a license from the patentee. The
court below sustained the defence on the latter ground, and entered the following decree: "Therefore, it is. ordered, adjudged,
and decreed, that the said bill of complaint is her-by dismissed,
with costs to be taxed, and that the defendant have execution
therefor2'
The ease is now before us on a motion to dismiss the ,appeal
Looking at the case as exhibited to us by the record, it appears
to be an appeal by respondents from a decree dismissing the
complainant's bill with costs. It often happens that a court
may decree in favor of a complainant, bu.t not to the extent
prayed for in his bill, and he may have just; cause of appeal on
that account. But the prayer of the respondent's answer is,
that " he be hence dismissed, with his reasonable costs and
charges, on this behalf most wrongfully sustained." And having such a decree on the present case, he cannot have a more
favorable one.
It is true that the petition for the appeal in this case prays
only, ' that so much of such parts of said decree, as .declares,
orders, adjudges, and decrees as follows, to wit " And it appear-

Corning et al. v. The Troy Iron and Nail Factory.

ing to the said court that the said Henry Burden was the first
inventor of the improvement, &c., may be reversed, and that the
appellants may be restored to all things which they have lost by
reason thereof."
But the matter complained of forms no part of the decree of
the court below.
It shows only, that the judge, in reciting the inducement or
reasons for entering a decree in favor of the respondents below,
was of opinion that they were entitled to such decree, because
they had succeeded in establishing one only of the two defenses
alleged in their answer. It is the opinion of the court, on a
question of fact involved in the 6ase, but not affecting the decree. If the decree be cortect, the party in whose favor it is
given, has no right to complain; yet his appeal prays that it
",may be reversed, and the appellants restored to all things
which they have lost by reason thereof;" and the record shows
they have lost nothing.
If the decree be reversed, according to the prayer of the appellants, the court must necessarily enter a decree for the complainants below. This would, probably, not meet the views of
the appellants. They have put themselves in the anomalous
position either of asking for the affirmance of the decree from
which they have appealed, or of requesting this court to reverse
a decree in their favor, and send back the record ti the court
below, with directions to enter the very same decree, but to
assign other reasons for it. The cout were not bound to give
any reasons for their decree. The law gives the party aggrieved an appeal from a final decree of an inferior court.
But it does not-give the party -who is not aggrieved an appeal
from a decree in his favor because the judge has given no reasons, or recited insufficient ones for a judgment admitted by
the appellant to be correct.
There is a part of the history of this case which does not
appear on the record; but, being known to the court, and assumed by counsel on both sides to, make part of the case, it
will be necessary to notice the case under that aspect.
The deciee in favor of the appellants, which is now appealed
from, has already been before this court on an appeal by the
complainant below. The parties were then fully heard, the decree of the Circuit Court reversed, and the case remanded for
farther proceedings. It is reported in 14 Howard, 194. It appears,
therefore, that there is no such decree as that which is now
complained of. The decree of the Circuit Court has been entirely annulled, reversed, and set aside by this court. Before
that was done, the appellants. had a full hearing on every point
of defence set up in their answer. The court below had de-

cided that the defendant had a good defence under his plea of
license, but not under the Flea that Burden was not the first in.
ventor of the patented machine. This court has decided, that
the appellant's defence was insufficient on both pleas. The
language of the court is, (14 How. 208,) "That the defendants
have failed to prove that Burden was not such first inventor;
and, in our opinion, the evidence given by them on that point
rather serves to establish the originality of the invention than
to impair it The appellants stand upon tLe patent, as the first
which was granted for the bending lever; and they may well
do so, until other evidence than that in this :record shall be given
to disprove its originality."
It is plain, therefore, that, under the guise of an appeal from
the decree of the Circuit Court, this is an appeal, in fact, from
the decision of this court. For there is no other decree existing
in the case except the decree of this court. There must be an
end of litigation some time. To allow a second appeal to a
'court of last resoit, on the same questions which were open
to dispute on the first, would lead to endless litigation. It is
said by this court, in Martin v. Hunter, (1 Wheat. 355,) "A
final judgment of the court is conclusive upon the rights which
it decides, and no' statute has provided any process by which
this court can revise its judgment." See, also, Sibbald v.
United. States, 12 Pet. 488. It follows, therefdre, that, when a
complainant has a decree in his favor, but not to the extent
prayed for in his bill, and the respondent appeals; if the complainant desires a more favorable decree, he must enter a cross
appeal, that, when the decree comes before the appellate court,
he may be heard. For, when the decree is either affirmed or
reversed by the appellate court, it becomes the decree of that
court, and cannot be the subject of another appeal. But, in
this case, where the decree of the court below dismissed the
bill, no appeal by the respondent was necessary. He had a
full opportunity to urge every defence set up in his answer.
The printed arguments show that "the defence, for want of ori.
ginality in the patent, was relied upon as a ground for affirming
the decree of the court below, and, as we 13ave already shown,
was distinctly passed upon and overruled by this court.
A second appeal lies only when the couri; below, in carrying
out the mandate of this court, is alleged to have committed an
error. But, on an appeal fiom the mandate, it is well settled,
that nothing is before the court but the proceedings subsequent
,to the mandate. Whatever was formerly before the court, and
was disposed of by its decree, is considered as finally disposed
of. Seb Himely v. Rose, 5 Cranch, 313; Canter v. The Ocean
Insurance Company, 1 Peters, 511; The Santa Maria, 10
Wheat. 431; Rice v. Wheatly, 9 Dana, 272,

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

United States v. Dawson et al.

Moreover, as it is admitted that the court below have not yet
acted upon the mandate of this court, and entered a final decree in pursuance thereof, there is no final decree, from which
only an appeal car be taken. See the Palmyra, 10 Wheat.
502; Chace v. Vasquez, 11 Id. 429.
There are, therefore, three conclusive reasons for dismissing
the present appeal:
1. The appellants have already been heard in this court on a
former appeal.
2. There is no such decree as that from which the appeal purports to be taken.
3. There is no final decree in the case, from which an appeal
can be taken.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northem District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On
consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and
decreed by this court, that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed, with costs.

THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS, v. JAm s
JonrN R. BAYLOR.

L. DAwsoN, AND

In June, 1844, Congress passed an act, by virtue of which the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Arkansas, was vested with power to try offences
cermitted within the Indian country.
In July, 1844, it was alleged that a murder was committed in that country.
In Apr l, 1845, an indictment was found by a grand jury, in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Arkansas, against a person charged with committing the murder.
In March, 1851, Congress passed an act erecting nine of the Western counties and
the Indian country into a new judicial district, directing the judge to hold two
terms there, and giving him jurisdiction of all causes, civil or criminal, except appeals and writs of error, which are cognizable before a Circuit Court of the United
States.
The residue of the State remained a judicial district to be styled the Eastern District
of Arkansas.
This act of Congress did not take away the power and jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Eastern District tr try the indictment pending.

Tns case came up from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Arkansas, upon a certificate
of division in opinion between the judges thereof.
