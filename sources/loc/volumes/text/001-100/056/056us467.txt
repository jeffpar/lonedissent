United States v. Dawson et al.

Moreover, as it is admitted that the court below have not yet
acted upon the mandate of this court, and entered a final decree in pursuance thereof, there is no final decree, from which
only an appeal car be taken. See the Palmyra, 10 Wheat.
502; Chace v. Vasquez, 11 Id. 429.
There are, therefore, three conclusive reasons for dismissing
the present appeal:
1. The appellants have already been heard in this court on a
former appeal.
2. There is no such decree as that from which the appeal purports to be taken.
3. There is no final decree in the case, from which an appeal
can be taken.
The appeal is therefore dismissed.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northem District of New York, and was argued by counsel. On
consideration whereof, it is now here ordered, adjudged, and
decreed by this court, that this cause be, and the same is hereby, dismissed, with costs.

THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFFS, v. JAm s
JonrN R. BAYLOR.

L. DAwsoN, AND

In June, 1844, Congress passed an act, by virtue of which the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Arkansas, was vested with power to try offences
cermitted within the Indian country.
In July, 1844, it was alleged that a murder was committed in that country.
In Apr l, 1845, an indictment was found by a grand jury, in the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Arkansas, against a person charged with committing the murder.
In March, 1851, Congress passed an act erecting nine of the Western counties and
the Indian country into a new judicial district, directing the judge to hold two
terms there, and giving him jurisdiction of all causes, civil or criminal, except appeals and writs of error, which are cognizable before a Circuit Court of the United
States.
The residue of the State remained a judicial district to be styled the Eastern District
of Arkansas.
This act of Congress did not take away the power and jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Eastern District tr try the indictment pending.

Tns case came up from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Arkansas, upon a certificate
of division in opinion between the judges thereof.

468

SUPREME

COURT.

United States v. Dawson et al.

The two following questions were certified, viz.
1st. Did the act of Congress, entitled "An act to divide the district of Arkansas into two judicial districts3," approved the third
day of March, in: the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, whereby the Western District of Arkansas
was created and defined, take awdy the power and jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Arkansas, so that it cannot proceed to hear, try, and determine a prosecution for murder, pending against the prisoner,
James L. Dawson, a white man and not an Indian, upon an indictment found, presented, and returned into the Circuit Court
of the United States for the Distriot of Arkansas, by the grand
jury impanelled for that district, upon the 16th day of April, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-five,
against said James L. Dawson, a white raan, for the felonious
killing of Seaborn Hill, another white man and not an Indian,
on the eighth day of July, A. D. 1844, in that country belonging
to the Creek nation of Indians, west of Arkansas, and which
formed a part of the Indian country annexed to the judicial district of Arkansas by the act of Congress approved the seventeenth day of June, A. D. 1844, entitled "An act supplementary
to the act entitled 'An act to regulate trade anti intercourse with
the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers, passed
thirtieth June, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-four,"'
in which cause, so pending, no trial has as yet been had.
2d. Can the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Arkansas take jurisdiction of the case aforesaid,
upon the indictment aforesaid, so found in the year 1845, in said
Circuit Court for the District of Arkansas ?
Altho'ugh the name of Dawson only was mentioned in the
question certified, yet the record showed that Baylor was indicted at the same as aiding and abetting in the murder.
A motion was made in the Circuit Court to quash the indictment upon the ground that this honorable court has no jurisdiction or power to hear, try, or determine this case and prosecution, and that all its jurisdiction and power in that behalf ceased
and was extinguished on the third day of March, 1851, when
that part of the Indian country, in which t.he offence is charged
to have been committed, was severed from this district, and
made part of a new district, under the jurisdiction of the District
Court of the United States, for the Western District of Arkansas."
It was upon this motion that the judges differed in opinion
and certified the two questions, above stated, to this court.
The motion to dismiss the case was argued by 21'r. Lawrence
and Mr. Pike, for Dawson, and by Mr. Cushing, (Attorney-General,) for the United State

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

469

United States v. Dawson et al.

11rr. Pike, in his brief, made the following argumentative
statement of preexisting laws upon the subject.
This is an indictment againt James L. Dawson for a murler
alleged to have been committed at the Creek agency, in the
Creek country, west of Arkansas, on the 8th day of July, A. D.
1844. The bill was found by the grand jury for the Arkansas
district, at the April term, 1845, of the Circuit Court of the
United States for the District of Arkansas.
At the April term, 1853, present MA. Justice Daniel, and the
honorable Daniel Ringo, district judge, a motion was made to
quash the indictment for want of jurisdiction, on which motion
the judges dividing in opinion, the prisoner was admitted to
bail in an amount which he has been wholly unable to give;
and upon a certificate of division of opinion the case has come
into this court.
By the act of Mfarch 3d, 1817, (3 Stat. at Large, 383,) jurisdiction and power of trial, in cases where offences were committed
in any town, district, or territory belonging to any nation or tribe
of Indians, were given to the courts of the United States "in
each territory and district of the United: States in which any
offender against this act shall -be first apprehended or brought
for trial."
The Constitution, art. Ill, sect. 2, No. 3, had provided that
"the trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be
by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the shid
crime shall have been committed; but when not committed
within any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the
Congress may by law have directed."
The States and people not thinking this a sufficient guaranty
for a fair and impartial trial, art. VI. of the amendments to the
Constitution provides that "in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an
impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall
have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law."
The Intercourse Act of 30th June, 1834, (4 Stat. at- Large,
733,) by the 24th section, after making divers provisions, defining the limits of the "Indian country," and imposing penalties
for sundry offences, provides "that, for the sole purpose of
carrying this act into effect," certain Indian country, bounded
east by Arkansas and MLissouri, west by Mexico, north by the
Osage country, and south by Red River, " shall be, and hereby
ia annexed to the territory of Arkansas;" and by section 25 it
was provided "ithat so much of the laws of the United States
as provides for the punishment of crimes committed within any
place .within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United
VOL. XV.

SUPREME

COURT.

United States v. Dawson et al.

States shall be in force in the Indian country; provided the
same -shall not extend to crimes committed by one Indian
against the person or property of another Indian." Power to
apprehend offenders in the Indian country, and take them into
"the judicial district having jurisdiction," was given by see. 26.
Under this act the Superior Court of the Arkansas Territory
took and exercised jurisdietion as to offences committed in the
'Indian territory so annexed to Arkansas.
But, by act of June 16th, 1836, (5 Stat. at Large, 50, 51,)
Arkansas was admitted as a State; and sec. 4 provided "that
the said State shall be one judicial district, and be called the
Arkansas District) and a District Court shell be held iherein, to
consist of one judge, who shall reside in the said district, and
be called a district judge." It was provided that he should hold
semiannual sessions at Little Rock, and that he should "in all
things have and exercise the same jurik.diction and powers
which were by law given to the judge of the Kentucky district,
under an act entitled An act to establish the udicial courts of
the United States."
That was the act of September 24th, 1789, (1 Stat. at Large,
73.) That act gave to the District Court cf Kentucky the juris.
diction of a circuit court, except on appeals and writs of error,
in addition to the ordinary district-court j arisdiction. Sec. 10,
and see. 29, provided that in cases punishable with death, the
trial should be had in the county where the offence was committed; or, where that could not be done without great inconyenience, twelve petit jurors at least should be summoned from
thehce
There was, in the act of 1836, no express repeal of so much
-of the act of 1834 as applied to Arkansas; but the legislature,
by expressly limiting and defining the bounds of the Arkansas
district,, and making it to be composed of the State, cut away
the Indian country, and severed its connectioii with Arkansas.
It was therefore held by the District Court of Arkansas that it
formed no part of the district, and that the court had no jurisdiction to try and determine cases upon indictments found in
the Superior Territorial Court, for offences committed in the Indian~country prior to the 15th June, 1836; and all prisoners so
indicted'were discharged.
To remedy this, by act of March 1, 1837, (5 Stat. at Large,
147,) it was provided, that the District Court of Arkansas should
have "the same jurisdiction and power in- all respects whatever
that was given to the several district courts," by the intercourse
act of March 30, 1802, "or by any subsequent acts of Congress,
-concerning crimes, offences, or misdemeano rs, which may be committed against the laWs of the United States in iiny town, set-

DEOEMBER TEIM, 1853.
United States v. Dawson et al.

tlement, or territory, belonging to any Indian tribe in amity with
he United States, of which any other district court of the United States may have jurisdiction."
Section 15 of this act of 1802, like the act of 1834, gave the
jurisdiction of offences committed against its provisions to the
territorial, circuit, and other courts of the United States, in each
district in which the offenders should be apprehended, or into
which, agreeably to the provisions of the act, they should be
brought for trial. By sec. 19, persons apprehended in the Indian
country were to be taken into one of the three adjoining States
or districts for triaL If apprehended in any district, they were,
by see. 17, to be tried there.
By act of March 3, 1837, (5 Stat. at Large, 176,) the districts
of Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas, and the Eastern District
of Louisiana, were erected into the ninth circuit; and provision
being made for holding a circuit court at Little Rock, it was
further, by the third section, provided, that so much of any act
or acts of Congress as vested in sundry district courts, including
that of Arkansas, "the power and jurisdiction of circuit courts,"
should be, and was thereby repealed, and like jurisdiction was
giveA to the Circuit Court of Arkansas as to other circuit
courts, and to the District Court of Arkansas as to other district courts.
Under these acts it was held by the Circuit Court for the
District of Aikansas, in 1842, I think, present Mr. Justice Daniel and the honorable Benjamin Johnson, district judge -that
the court had no jurisdiction as to offences committed in the
lnhdan country.
By act of August 23, 1842, (5 Stat. at Large, 517,) concurrent
jurisdiction with the Circuit Court'was given to the district
courts in prosecutions for offences not capital.
And by act of June 17, 1844, (a few days before the day on
which the offence in this case is charged in the indictment to
have been committed,) 5 Stat. at Large, 680, the courts of the
United States in and for the district of Arkansas were vested
with the same power and jurisdiction, to hear, try, determine,
and punish, all crimes committed within the Indian country
designated in the 24th section of the intercourse act of June
30, 1834, and therein and thereby annexed to the territory of Arkansas, as were vested in the courts of the United States for
that territory before it became a State; and the act went on to
declare: "That for the sole purpose of carrying this act into
effect, all that Indian territory heretofore annexed by the said
24th section of the act aforesaid to the territory of Arkansas,
be, and the same hereby is annexed to the State of Arkansas."
Under this act, the Circuit Court assumed jurisdiction of

472

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

offencescommi-ted in the Indian country; and, among other
indictments, this was found.
But on the 3d of March, 1851, a new act passed, (9 Stat. at
Large, 594,) by which it was enacted - Sec. 1. That from and
after the passage of this act, the counties of Benton, Washington, Crawford, Scott, Polk, Franklin, Johnson, Madison, and
Carroll, and all that part of the Indian country lying within the
present judicial district of Arkansas,.shall constitute a new judicial district, ta be styled ' The Western D.strict of Arkansas;'
and the residue of said State shall be and remain a judicial
district,, to be styled 'The Eastern District of Arkansas.'"
By sec. 2 of this singularly Worded act, " the judge of the Distridt-Court of Arkansas" is directed to hold two terms "of said
court" in each year; at Van Buren, in Crawford county, and
special and adjouined sessions when needed.
By see. 3 it is provided, that "the Districb Court of the United
States for the Western District of Arkansas, hereby established,"
shall have, besides district-court jurisdiction, "within the limits
of its respective district," circuit-court j.urisdiction, except in
cages of appeals and writs of error, and proceed like a circuit
court, with right of appeal to the Supreme Court.
By see. 4 a marshal and district-attorney "for said Western
District of Arkansas," were provided for, and the district judge
was empowered to appoint a clerk "of said court hereby established. '
Since the passage of this act, and the establishment of the
District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, that court
has taken jurisdiction of indictments fotnd there for capital
offences committed in the Indian country prior to the passage
of the act, and has tried, convicted, and -entenced the parties,
and had them executed.
And at the same time a Circuit Court for the Eastern District
of Arkansas has~been opened and held, succeeding to the business of the Circuit Court for the Djstrict of Arkansas, and the
cases pending there when the act passed had been proceeded in
as still in the same court. Persons have been tried for offences
committed in the Indian country, and upon indictments found
in the Circuit Court for the District of Arkansas, prior to the
passage of the act of 1851 ; and one, convicted of manslaughter,
is stl imprisoned under the, sentence. But in the case of Dawson, the question of jurisdiction was formally raised, and comes
up here for consideration.
At common law, in criminal cases, the venue was local, and
matter of substance affecting the jurisdiction and power of the
grand jury, who were to find the indictment or make the presentment, as well as of the court who were to try the cause
aud carry into effect the law. 1 Chitty, Cr. Law, 177, 190.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

473

United States v. Dawson et al.

(After examining the English authorities upon this point, the
counsel proceeded to the American.)
One of the grounds of complaint, set forth in the Declaration
of Independence against the English king, was "for transport.
ing us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences."
After the Constitution was framed, it did not seem to the
States and people that the rights of the citizen were sufficiently
guarded by the provision which gave Congress, where an offence
was not committed within any State, the power to direct, as
well after as before the offence was committed, at what place
the trial should be had. The objections to this were obvious.
In every case where an offence was committed beyond the limits
of a State, as on the high seas or in a territory, Congress might
virtually decide the case against the accused by directing that
he should be tried in a remote or unfriendly district. If the
offence were a political one, especially, this was a power dangerous and odious in the extreme. The si:th article of the
amendments wisely took away this whole power, and provided
that the trial of all criminal prosecutions should be by an im.
partial jury of the State and district wherein the crime should
have been committed, and required that such district should
have been previously ascertained by law. It is obvious that the
phrase means, previously to the commission of the offence, because, if Congress could create or ascertain the district after its
commission, that was continuing their power to direct the trial
to be had at whatever place they might think most apt and fit
for the particular case.
It will occur to every one, that it would be intolerable if a
power existed by which, if a man committed an offence in
Oregon or Plorida, Congress might, in order to strike him down
with perfect certainty, attach the particular place where he committed the offence to the District of Maine, so as to carry him
to Portland for trial; retaining, of course, the power to sever
again from the district the country so attached, so soon as the
political or other offender should be immolated, and the ends of
public or party vengeance attained.
And it will also occur, that it would be equally dangerous to
concede to Congress a power when an offence has been committed, to sever the particular place at which it was committed
from the district of which it then formed a part and so, disenabling the court to send beyond .its district for jurors, utterly
deprive the accused of the right to a jury of the vicinage.
It was not intended by the amendment to leave the rights of
the accused to be settled by the caprice or hostility of Congress,
and by laws enacted on the spur of the moment to suit the
40 *

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

particular '6ccasion, reach the particular case, and strike the
particular individual.
The amendment is, therefore, peremptory. No man can be
tried, under any circumstances, elsewhere than in the State or
district where he committed the offence. Nor can new districts
be created, ad libitun, after the offence is committed, to carry
the trial to whatever remote point Congress may please, for
reasons of prejudice, ill will, or favoritism, in order to acquit or
convict, as inward feeling or outward pressure may dictate,
giving to the particular party, at the option of Congress, friend.ly or unfriendly juries and judges, and allc-wing or taking from
him a jury of his vicinage. Such a power, in a free country,
would be intolerable. Congress could acquit or condemn at its
pleasure. The district within which the cime was committed
must have been previously ascertained by aw. Thus, and thus
only, will a possibility of special legislation for the particular
case be avoided, and this power of attainder in disguise taken
away.
There have never been but two districts in which it could be
said that the offence in this case was committed. The Eastern
District of Arkansas is limited to certain specified counties of
the State; and it is not the district within which the offence
was committed. It was committed in the former District of
Arkansas, and in what now forms a part of the Western District of Arkansas. If Dawson is now tried in the Eastern
District, certainly he is not tried in the district within which he
committed the offence.
The notion upon which the claim to jurisdiction appears to
rest is, that the Circuit Court for the Eastern District is either
the same court as the former Circuit Cour; for Arkansas, or its
successor. But so is the District Court for the Western District its successor; for the judge of the; District Court of
Arkansas is to hold two terms of said court at Van Buren.
This idea does not even sound the question. to see how deep
it is, To create a circuit or district court, and confer upon it
all. power to punish crimes within the power of Congress to
bestow, would be wholly unavailing, until the territory was defined within whose limits its jurisdiction should operate. No
jurisdiction whatever could be exercised until a district was
established and defined. The continued existence of the court
avails nothing, if its jurisdiction is compressed into narrower
territorial limits. Its power shrinks within these liiits at once.
If the particular place in which the offence was committed is,
after the commission of the offence,.severed from the district, or
left oufside of the jurisdiction by the prozess of compression,
and the offence is still tried in the court whose jurisdiction is so
-

DEC:'3MBER TERM,

1853.

United States v. Dawson et al.

narrowed, the offence, we may admit, would be tried in the
same court as if it had been tried there before the exdision of
territory; but the fact still remains, that it will not be tried in
the district, previously ascertained by law, in which the offence
was committed.
It is said that it is the district in which the offence was committed. That is not so, because it is a new and different
district altogether; the district in which the offence was committed no longer exists, but two new districts exist in lieu of it.
It might as well be said that, if you sever a man in the middle,
he still exists. Suppose, however, that the act had merely taken
off from the Arkansas District the Indian country, and left the
former district to stand with its old name, still the Arkansas
District, as it was before-totus teres atqve rotundus-still,although the Arkansas District, it would not be the district in
which the offence was committed. If you cut off a man's hand,
the man remains, identical and one, as before; because the
man, the individual, the rae, is something different and distinct
from each of his members. You may even imagine that a particular faculty or part of the soul could be cut away, and yet the
residue would continue the identical individual which existed
before.
But if you cut a tract of land or country in two, you may call
one half by the, name previously borne by the whole, and for
some purposes it may be the same tract or country; but for
others it is not so. Take from Arkansas a county, or half a
dozen counties, and in many senses the residue would be the
same Arkansas that existed before. Suits in her favor would
not abate, nor h6r contracts be annulled, because the sovereignty
or municipal corporatioa which constitutes the State does not
lose its individuality by parting with a portion of its territory.
But the word district does not mean a corporation, or a being,
but a mere tract and extent of country; and, W'hen it is divided,
one half of it is no-more the same district that existed before
than the other is. A half is not the whole; nor can two halves
continue to be each the previous whole.
This may be made more plain, and the fallacy of the notion
more striking, by reflecting that it operatey both ways; and, if
the district remains the same when part'of its territory is cut
away, so it would if a vast extent of new territory was added.
Suppose Congress had chosen to annex the Indian country to
the Dist-rict of Columbia, the argument would be thus: The
crime was committed at the Creek agency; that is now made
part of the District of Columbia by annexation. The District
of Columbia is a corporatipn, one and identical, the same now
as before; consequently, it is the District of Columbia in which

476

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

the offence was committed. On the other hand, it could be
said the offence was committed in the District of Arkansas; the
place where it was committed no longer forms part of that dis.
ict; but the fact still remains, that the crime was committed
in the District of Arkansas.
All the reason of- the thing would be in favor of the District
of Columbia; because the locus of the offence now forming
part of that district, the accused might have a jury of the
vicinage; while, if tried in the maimed District of Arkansas,
he could not.
The truth is, that the continued existence and identity of the
metaphysical ens, called district, territory, state, or of that other
called the court, has nothing to do with the question. If it has,
the right guaranteed amounts to nothing. The trial is to be in
the district where the offence was committed, in order that the
party may have, if not the reality, at least the possibility or
fiction of a right to a jury of the vicinage. A constitutional
provision, without a reason for it, would be a monster. The
right is one that continues to the trial; it :is, indeed, a right of
the trial. The right is, that the identical pl4ce, and fixed solid
ground,, or unstable water, where the offence was committed,
shall then be within the district in which the party is to be tried.
If there'is any district in which this person could now be tried,
it is the Western District of Arkansas. The only way to avoid
the difficulty would have been, as the cases we have cited show,
for Congress to have declared the old district to continue, with
its'original territorial extent, for all the purposes of this and
similar cases.
The courts of the United States have no jurisdiction, as to
crimes, except such as is expressly confelred by statute. In
such cases, they have no implied powers, ror any derived from
the common law. Hudson v. Goodwin, 7 Cranch, 32.; United
States v. Wonall, 2 Dallas, 384; United States v. Coolidge, 1
Wheat. 415; 1 Kent, 337-8-9; United States v. Bevans, 3
Wheat. 336.
And it is equally indispensable that the law should put the
place where the crime occurs within the jurisdiction of the court
which is to try the case. United States v. McGill, 4 Dall. 426;
United States v. Bevans, 3 Wheat. 336; Ex parte Bollman and
Swartwout, 4 Cranch, 75, 131; United States v. Wiltberger, 5
Wheat. 76.
It is a well-settled principle, that where a statute creating an
offence is repealed, and no provision is made for carrying forward prosecutions commenced under it, ell such prosecutions
are absolutely ended with the repeal of the law.
Such was decided to be the effect of t:ae act repeafling the

DECEM1BER TERM, 1853.

477

United States v. Dawson et al.

bankrupt act of 1803, in United States v. Passmore, 4 DaI.
372.
And the same decision was made in Miller's case, 1 W. Bla.
451. N6 proceedings are pursuable under a repealed statute,
which commenced before the repeal.
These decisions, and others to which we shall refer, do not
proceed upon any peculiar principle especially applying to penalties imposed by repealed acts, or to the destruction of the
criminal character of acts done before the repeal, but upon a
broad general principle of universal application.
And that principle is simply that stated by Lord Tenterden,
in Surtees v. Ellison, 9 Barn. & Cresw. 752, where he said:
" It has been long established that, -when an act of parliament
is repealed, it must be considered, except as to transactions
passed and closed, as if it had never existed. That is the general rule; and we must not destroy that by indulging in conjectures as to the intention of the legislature. We, are therefore
to look at the statute, 6 Geo. 4, ch. 16, as if it were the first that
had ever been passed on the subject of bankruptcy." His lordship felt the pressure of the consequences of the decision, but
the law was too well settled to be disregarded; and he added:
" It is certainly very unfortunate, that a statute of so milch importance should have been framed with so little attention to the
consequences of some of its provisions. It is said that the last
will of a party is to be favorably construed, because the testator
is inops consilii. That we cannot say of the legislature; but
we may say that it is 'magnas inter opes inops.'" See also
Dwarris on Statutes, 673, 676.
The counsel then proceeded to examine other analogous principles, which there is not room to insert.
Xrr. Cushing, (Attorney-General,) insisted that the act of 3d
March, 1851, has not taken away the jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court to hear and determine the said indictment then found
and pending.
The said act of 3d March, 1851, did not create a new Circuit
Court. It created a new District Court, having the ordinary
powers of the District Court of the United States within the
territory assigned to it, with an anomalous increase of jurisdiction; but it left the then existing Circuit Court unrepealed. in
being and activity.
The general powers of the then existing Circuit Court, remained unimpaired as to cases begun and pending; its future
jurisdiction was limited to cases originating within a smaller
territorial district. The territory within which the Cirtuit
Court then existing should exercise its powers over new suits

478

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

and prosecutions thereafter to be instituted, was lessened; but
the powers which belonged to it as a circuit court, and as common to all the other Circuit Courts of the United States, were
not diminished.
The general rule is, that where the jurisdiction of a court over
the subject-matter has once vested, it is not divested by a subsequent change of circumstance. United States v. Myers, 2
Brock. 516; Morgan v. Morgan, 2 Wheat. 290; Mollan v. Torrance, 9 Wheat. 537; Clarke v. Matthewson, 12 Peters, 165.
Thus, where the complainants, being citizens of a State other
than Kentucky, sued citizens of the State of Kentucky in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the Kentucky District,
and pending the suit one of the complainants voluntarily removed to, and became a citizen of, the State of Kentucky, the
Supreme Court of the United States decided unanimously "that
the jurisdiction of the court having once vested, was not divested
by the change of residence of either of the parties." Mlorgan's
heirs v. Morgan, 2 Wheat. 293, 297.
There are no words in the act of 1851 to give it a retrospect:
ive effect, to make it retroact upon pending suits and prosecutions, rightfully commenced in the, preexisting and continuing
Circuit Court. To give, by implication, a retrospective effect
to the newly-creatcd District Court, whereby to divest a preexisting and continuing superior Circuit Court of its cognizance
over .suits, actions, and _prosecutions rightfully begun therein,
and undetermined, would violate the rules of just construction
and right reasoning.
Heretofore when a circuit court has been established within
a district wherein only a district court had been established
with the powers of a district court and of a circuit court, in
order to divest the District Court, of its cogriizance of cases pending, which belonged to the proper cogniza.nce and jurisdiction
of a circuit court, and transfer them into the newly-created
Circuit Court, or when new courts have been established,
whether circuit courts or district courts, and it was intended by
the Congress of the United States to transfer cases pending in
the old or pre~xisting courts into the newly-created courts, there
to be heard, tried, and determined, it has been deemed necessary
and proper to employ express and positive enactments to effect
such purposes, and they have been used invariably to that end.
Thus in the act of Congress of 13th February, 1801, (2.Stat.
at Large, 89,) two sections viz. see. 20 and 24, were introduced
as specially applicable. This act was repealed by 8th March,
1802, (2 Stat. at Large, 132,) and the preceding judicial system
reinstated, and sections 4 and 5 introduced to provide for the
case.

United States v. Dawson et al.

The act of 24th February, 1807, (2 Stat. at Large, 420,) established Circuit Courts and abridged the jurisdiction of the District Courts in the District of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio,
and sec. !3 provided for the transfer of cases.
The act of April 20th, 1818, (3 Stat. at Large, 462,) divided
Pennsylvania into two districts, and sections 4 and 6, provided
for th6 transfer of cases.
The act of March 10th, 1824, (4 Stat. at Large, 9,) divided
Alabama into two districts, and see. 5 made the necessary provisions.
The act of 3d March, 1837, (5 Stat. at Large, 176,) erected
twelve new Circuit Courts. The third and fourth sections provided for this case.
In these six statutes, last quoted, we have examples of two
classes, relative to the divisions of districts and the establishment of courts therein: one class containing enactments for
transferring cases, begun and pending in one District Court, to
another District Court, established in a part of the territory
formerly composing one district; the second class containing
express provisions to take away the jurisdiction of district
courts, acting as circuit courts, over cases, civil and criminal,
begun and pending in such inferior district courts, and to
transfer the cognizance thereof to the superior circuit courts
newly established in the same districts.
If positive enactments were necessary and proper to divest the
jurisdiction of ir -rior district courts over causes, actions, and
pleas rightfully begi!' and pending therein, and to transfer the
cognizance thereof to superior circuit courts newly established
in the same districts, a fortiori,express and positive enactment
would be necessary to divest the jhrisdiction of a superior court
over cases rightfully begun and pending therein, and to transfer
the cognizance thereof, from such existing pontinuing superior
court, to an inferior district court newly established wvithin the
same territory which composed the district when the proceeding was instituted in the Circuit Court.
We have examples of legislation by Congress by which new
judicial districts have been foxmed out of the old, with total
silence as to the cognizance of actions or prosecutions pending
in the old, viz.
The act of April 9th, 1814, (3 Stat. at Large, 120,) and the
act of February 21st, 1823, (3 Stat. at Large, 726.) In these
acts, cases were left to be heard, tried, and determined under
the general rule that when once the jurisdiction of a court has
rightfully attached by action, writ, or prosecution, instituted, it
is not divested by change of circumstances, by mere implication,
or otherwise than by express enactment.

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson ei; al.

The two acts of May 26th, 1824, (4 Stat. at Large, 50,) and
May 26th, 1824, (4 Stat. at Large, 48,) took away certain counties and attached them to another district, and no special provision was thought necessary respecting cases then pending.
Furthen4ore, we have examples of the legislation of the Congress of the United States in dividing one judicial district, in
the States of North Carolina, into three judicial districts; thereafter, in consolidating the three into one, and afterwards in
dividing that one into three judicial districts, viz.
The act of 9th June, 1794, (1 Stat. at La:rge, 396); the act of
3d March, 1797, (1 Stat. at Large, 518); the act of 29th April,
1802, (2 Stat at Large, 156.) In these acts there are provisions
that there shall be no failure of justice by abatement or discontinuance of the process or lapse of jurisdiction.
The act of 3d April, 1794, (1 Stat. at Large, 352,) transfers
jurisdiction from one court to another and provides for the trial
of cases.
The various acts of Congress for dividing judicial districts,
and for taking off territories or counties from one judicial district and adding them to another, and for consolidation of judicial districts into one, and again for di.ding that one into
several, and for creating new courts by abolishing some prexisting, and substituting others in their stead, when compared
each with the others, evince, beyond doubt, that the legislature,
in framing those statutes, understood and acted upon the following principles and rules of law, viz.
1st. That to abolish the jurisdiction of one'existing and continuing court over any of the subjects originally committed to
its cognizance, and to transfer such jurisdiction to another court,
it was necessary and proper to use words aptly and clearly expressive of such intent.
2d.- That when the jurisdibtion of a court had once rightfully
ested over a cause begun and pending, it was not divested by
change of circumstance,- but continued with the court, until
plainly taken away by the legislature, or until the court itself
was abolished.
By these rules the acts of the legislature are to be construed.
Otherwise the most unexpected, inconvenient, nay, calamitous
consequences would result, with miserable confusion of all justice.
If taking off territory from one judicial district and adding to
another ipsofacto abrogates the jurisdiction of the courts (district and circuit) holden for such diminished district over cases
then pending and originated in such territory7 s6 taken from one
judicial district atid added to another, then the people of.Virginia, of New York, and of Pennsylvania, would have been
thrown into d strange predicament.

United States v. Dawson et al.

The statues before cited for dividing the judicial districts in
Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania, respectively, and afterwards for diminishing the one and enlarging the other in each
State, made no special provision for, but were silent as to, cases
then pending. The tourts wherein they were pending, supposing their jurisdiction to have continued, went on to hear and
deterrnine them. But if the doctrine now contended for by the
counsel for Dawson is to prevail, the said courts had no jurisdiction ; their decisions are absolutely void, confer no right, bar no
right, and all concerned in executing them were trespasiers; for
such are the consequences of decisions and sentences of courts
not having jurisdiction. Elliot v. Piersol, 1 Peters, 340;. Wise
v. Withers, 3 Cranch, 337; Rose v. Himely, 4 Cranch, 2.69.
A question arose upon the before-mentioned ct of 1824, May
26, taking away certain counties from the Eastern district of
Pennsylvania and adding them to the western district, in an
action of ejectment pending in the Circuit Court for the district
of Pennsylvania, for land lying in Union county, one of the
counties so taken from the eastern and added to the western district. The question was made at the first sitting of the Circuit
Court for the district of Pennsylvania after the passage of the
act of 1824, whether the said ejeetment so instituted and pending at the passage of that act should be retained in the Circuit
Court, or be sent to the western district court, acting as a Circuit Court. Upon argument, Mrx. Associate Justice Washington and Judge Peters decided that the case should be retained;
that the said act had not transferred it to the western district.
Lessee of Rhodes and Snyder v. Selin, 4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 725.
To combat this decision, the counsel for the accused cites the
cases of Picquet v. Swan, 5 Mason, 35, and Toland v. Sprague,
12 Peters, 300. The case of Piquet v. Swan is cited to prove
"that title to real estate, by the general principles of law, can
be litigated only in the State where the land lies, and where the
process may go to find and reach the land and enforce the title
of the party." This extract, quoted by the counsel for the accused, is connected with the next preceding and the next succeeding sentence, to actions, in their nature, "purely local."
and immediately afterwards Judge Story explains himself fLther, by saying "collateral suits for other purposes, binding the
conscience, or controlling the acts of the party personally, may
be brought and decided elsewhere." 5 Mason, 42. The case
did not involve the question of a rightful jurisdiction vested, and
sought to be divested by matter subsequent. It was a case
brought in the federal court, and district of Massachusetts, by
an alien, against a citizen of the United States, then out of the
United States, but late of the city of Boston, by color of the
VOL. XV.

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

State law and a process called the trustee process, or foreign
attachment, and returned by the marshal that he had attached
the real estate of the defendant in the distrit of Massachusetts,
summoned the supposed trustees and agent of the defendant,
Swan, but that "the said Swan has not been an inhabitant or
resident of this district (Massachusetts) for three years last
past." Such a suit, Judge Story decided, could not be so commenced in the federal court contrary to the federal law, although
allowed by the law of the State of Massachusetts.
In Penn v. Lord Baltimore, in the High Court of Chancery
of England, respecting the title to land in Maryland, Lord
Hardwick decided that it was no objection to the decree for
settling the right between the parties, that the land was in
Maryland, and not itself to be reached by the process of that
court. Penn v. Lord Baltimore, 1 Ves. sen. 454, 455.
By the 6th section of the act of 3d March, 1797, (1 Statutes at
Large, by .L. & B., p. 516, chap. 20,) writs of execution, upon
any judgment obtained for the use of the United States in one
State, may run and be executed in any other State, or in any
of the territories of the United States. Subpcenas for witnesses
may run from one district to any other, by act of March 2,
1793, (1 Statutes at Large, by L. & B., p. 335, chap. 22, sec. 6.)
And executions "upon judgments or decrees obtained in any
of the district or circuit courts of the United States, in any
one State, which shall have been, or may hereafter be, divided
into two judicial districts, may run and be executed in any part
of such State ;" act of 20th May, 1826, (4 Statdites at Large,
by L. & B., p. 184, chap. 123.) So that the question of jurisdiction was not involved in the case of Picquet v. Swan; but
only the sufficiency of the process by foreign attachment against
the absentee, not served personally with the process, to entitle
the plaintiff to judgment by default.
The case of Toland v. Sprague, 12 Peters, 300, cited by the
counsel of the accused, was not a case of jurisdiction once
rightfully vested and sought to be divested by matter subsequent; but a question whether, according to the acts of Congress, a citizen of Pennsylvania could commence a suit in the
Circuit Court of the United States for the *EasternDistrict of
Pennsylvania, by process of attachment of property within the
State, (as authorized by a law of the State,) belonging to the
absentee, who was a citizen of the State of Massachusetts.
The defendant appeared and pleaded to issue, having moved to
quash the process. The court below rendered judgment .in
chief for the plaintiff for his demand. This court decided that
the process of attachment had issued improperly; but as the
defendant had appeared and pleaded to issue, this court said:

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

483

United States v. Dawson et al.

"Now if the case were one of a want of jurisdiction in the
court, it would not, according to the well-established principles,
be competent for the parties by any act of theirs to give it.
But that is not the case. The court had jurisdiction over the
parties, and the matter in dispute; the objection was, that the
party defendant not being an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, nor
found therein, personal process could reach him; and that the
process of attachment could only be issued properly against a
party under circumstances -which subjected him to .process ik
personarm. Now this was a personal privilege or exemption
which it was competent for the party to waive, . . . and that
appearing and pleading will produce that waiver" 12 Peters,
330, 331. And thereupoai the judgment was affirmed.
These cases do not shake the opinion in the case of Rhodes
v. Selin, 4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 725. The principle on which it
stands, that a jurisdiction once rightfully vested, is not divested
by after circumstances, but only by express transfer to some
other tribunal, or by express repeal, is sustained by the case of
Morgan's heirs v. Morgan, 2 'heat. 297; Tyrell v. Roundtee,
7 Peters, 467, 468.
The conclusion in the case of Rhodes v.. Selin, and which is
here maintained, is not a novelty or anomaly, as seems to be
assumed in behalf of the defendant; it is but a single instance
of a general doctrine of statute construction, which is this:
If part of a defined territory, having functions or duties poll.
tical, judicial, municipal, or other, be separated from it, either by
annexion to another, or by being converted into a new political,
judicial, municipal, or other entity, then the remaining part of
the territory, or the former public body, retains all its property,
powvers, rights, and privileges, and remains subject to all its
obligations and duties, unless some express provisions t6 the
contrary be made by the act authorizing the separation.
The counsel for the accused relies upon the Constitution of
the United States as amended, for an argument against the
jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Arkansas.
The Constitution, in art. 3, sec. 2, provides: "The trial of all
crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and
such trial shall be held in the State, where the said crimes shall
have been committed; but when not committed within any
State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress
may by law have directed."
This provision authorized the act of Congress, which presbribed that the trial of the crime charged in the indictment as committed in the Indian country, out of the limits of any State,
should be had in the Circuit Court of Arkansas.
The 6th. article of the amendments to the Constitution, that

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et a.

" the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,
by an impartial jury of the State and distict wherein the crime
shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law," does not conflict with the law for
defining the place and district for the trial of Dawson. He committed the crime in no State. He was indicted within a district
defined and ascertained by law before the crime itself was committed; therefore within the letter and within the spirit and
meaning of the Constitution, howsoever the words -" which
district shall have been previously ascertained by law" - may
be construed to nmean. before the crime was committed, or before
the trial. The Constitution does not inbend that crimes committed by citizens of the United States on board of our vessels
on the high seas, or out of any State, or in the Indian nations
and tribes within the United States, should go unpunished.
This amendment of the Constitution applies only where the
offence has been committed in a State. Then the trial must be
in that State, and the district "previously ascertained by law"
must be within that State. But where the crime is not committed in any State of this Union, the trial may be wherever
within the jurisdicti6n of the United Stats the Congress shall
by law direct.
Finally, it is insisted for the United States that the jurisdiction vested rightfully in the Circuit Court of Arkansas, by the
indictment therein found; and as that court is in being, unrepealed, and continuing in full power and activity as a Circuit
Court of the United States, that jurisdiction and cognizance to
try the crime charged in the indictment continues; *thatit is
neither abrogated nor transferred to any other tribunal by the
said subsequent act of 1851. If the legislature had intended to
transfer the cognizance of pending cases, civil or criminal, they
would have used the express words and enactments to that end,
which they had employed in so many previout like cases.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The defendant was indicted, in the Circuit Conit of the United
States for the District of Arkansas, for the alleged murder of
one Seabom Hill., in the Indian country west of the State of
Arkansas.
The defenidant is a white man, and so was Hill, the deceased.
At a Circuit Court held at the city of Little Rock, on the
28th of April, 1853, the indictment came on for trial before the
judges of that court; whereupon a motion 'was made, on behalf
of the defendant, to quash the indictment, for want of jurisdiction of'the court to try the same.
And, upon the argument, the judges being divided in opinion,

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

485

United States v. Dawsoib et al.

the following question was certified to this court for its decision.
1. Did the act of Congress entitled "An act to divide the District of Arkansas into two judicial districts," approved.the 3d
of March, 1851, b which the Western District of Arkansas
was created, take away the power and jurisdiction of the Circuit
Court of the United States for the Eastern District to try the
indictment pending against the prisoner, James L. Dawson, a
white man, found in the Circuit Court of the United States for
the District of Arkansas, by a grand jury impanelled on the
16th April, 1845, for feloniously killing Seaborn Hill, a white
man, on the 8th of July, 1844, in the country belonging to the
Creek nation of Indians west of Arkansas, and which formed
a part of the Indian country annexed to the judicial district of
Arkansas, by the act of Congress approved on the 17th of June,
1844, "An act supplementary to the act entitled 'An act to regulate trade and intercourse with Indian tribes, and to preserve
peace on the frontiers,' passed 30th of June, 1834.
To state the question presented for our decision in a more
simple form, it is this: At the time the State of Arkansas composed but one judicial district, in which the federal courts were
held, the Indian country lying west of the State was annexed
to it for the trial of crimes committed therein by persons other
than Indians. In this condition of the jurisdiction of these
courts, the crime in question was committed in the Indian
country, and the indictment found in the Circuit Court, at the
April term, 1845, while sitting at the city of Little Rock, the
place of holding the court.
Subsequent to this, the State was divided into two judicial
districts, the one called the Eastern, the other the Western District of Arkansas. The Indian country was attached to and
has since belonged to the western district. The question presented for our decision is, whether or not the Circuit Court for
the Eastern District is competent to try this indictment,, since
change in the arrangements of the.districts.
By the 24th section of act of Congress, June 30th, 1834, (4
Stat. at Large, 733,) it was provided, that all that part of the
Indian country west of the Mississippi river, bounded north by
the northern boundary of lands assigned to the Osage tribe of
Indians, west by the Mexican possessions, south by Red rivers
and east by the west line of the Territory of Arkansas, and
State of Missouri, should be annexed.to the terr.torial government of Arkansas, for the sole purpose of carrying the several
provisions of the act into effect. And the 25th section enacted,
that so much of the laws of the United States as piovides for
the punishment of crimes committed within any place within

486

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson etal.

the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, shall be
in force in the Indian country, provided the same shall not extend to crimes committed by one Indian against the person or
property of another Indian.
The act of Congress, June 7th, 1844, (5 Stat. at Large, 680,)
which was enacted after the Territory of Arkansas became a
State, provided, that the courts of the United States, for the
District of the State of Arkansas, should be vested with the
same power and jurisdiction to punish crimes committd within
the Indian country designated in the 24th ,;ection of the act of
1834, and therein annexed to the Territory of Arkansas, as were
vested in the courts of the United States for said territory before
the same became a State; and that, for the sole purpose of car.
rying the act into effect, all that Indian country theretofore annexed by said 24th section to the said territory, should be annexed
to the State of Arkansas,
As we have already stated, the crime in question was conmitted in this Indian country after it was annexed, for the
purposes stated, to the State of Arkansas; and the indictment
was found in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Arkansas, which, we have seen, was coextensive with
the State. And, if no change had taken place in the arrangement of the district, before the trial, there could, of course, have
been no question as to the jurisdiction of the court.
But by the act of Congress, 3d March, 1851, it was provided,
that the counties of Benton and eight others enumerated, and
all that part of the Indian country annexed to the State of Arkansas for the purposes stated, should consdtute a new judidial
district, to be styled "The Western District of Arkansas," and
th residue of said State should be and remain a judicial dis.
trict, tb be styled "The Eastern District of Arkansas."
The 2d section provides, that the judge of the District Court
should hold two terms of his court in this, western district ir.
each year at Van Buren, the county seat in Crawford county.
And the third confers upon him, in addition to the ordinary
powers of a district court, jurisdiction within the district, of all
causes, civil or criminal, except appeals and -wiits of error,
which are cognizable before a circuit court of the United States.
The fourth provides for the appointment of a district-attorney
and marshal for the district, and also for a clerk of the court.
It will be seen, on a careful perusal of this act, that it simply
erects a new judicial district out of nine of the western counties
in the State, together with the Indian comatry, and confers on
the district judge, besides the jurisdiction already possessed,
eircuit court powers within the district, subject to the limitation
a sto appeals and writs of error; leaving the powers and juris-

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

487

United States v. Dawson et al.

diction of the circuit and district courts as they existed in the
remaining portion of the State, untouched. These remain and
continue within the district after the change, the same as before;
the only effect being to restrict the territory over which the jurisdiction extends. He.nce no provision is made as to the time or
place of holding the circuit or district courts in the district, or in
respect to the officers of the courts, such as district-attorney,
marshal or clerk, or for organizing the courts for the despatch
of their business. These are all provided for under the old organization. 5 Stat. at Large, 50, 51, 176, 177, 178.
XWe do not, therefore, perceive any objection to the jurisdiction of these courts over cases pending at the time the change
took place, civil and criminal, inasmuch as the erection of the
new district was not intended to affect it in respect to such
cases, nor has it, in our judgment, necessarily operated to de
prive them of it.
It has been supposed that a provision in the sixth amendment
of the Constitution of the United States has a bearing upon this
question, which provides, that "In all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an
impartial jury of the State an& district wherein the crime shall
have been committed, which district shall have been previously
ascertained by law." The argument is, that, since the erection of
the new district out of the nine western counties in the tate,
together with the Indian country, it is not competent for the
Circuit Court, in view of this amendment, to try the prisoners
within the remaining portion of the old district, inasmuch as
thit amendment requires the district within which the offence is
committed, and the trial is to be had, must be ascertained and
fixed previous to the commission of the offence.
But it will be seen from the words of this amendment, that it
applies only to the case of offences committed within the limits
of a State; and, whatever might be our conclusion if this offence had been committed within the State of Arkansas, it is
sufficient here to say, so far as it respects the objection, that the
offence was committed out of its limit, and within the Indian
country.
The language of the amendment is too particular and specific
to leave any doubt about it: "The accused shall enjoy the right
to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State
and district wherein the crime shall be committed, which district
shall have been previously ascertained by law."
The only regulation in the Constitution, as it respects crimes
committed out of the limits of a State; is to be found in the 3d
art., sec. 2, of the Constitution, as follows: "The trial of crimes,
except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury, and such trial

488

SUPREME

COURT.

United States v. Dawson et al.

shall be held in the State where the said cimes shall have been
committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial
shall be at such place or places as the Congress may, by law,
have directed."
Accordingly, in the first crimes act, passed April 30, 1790, § 8,
(1 Statutes at Large, p. 114,) it was provided, that "the trial
of crimes committed on the high seas, or in any place out of
the jurisdiction of any particular State, shall be in the district
where the offender is apprehended, or into which he may first
be brought."
A crime, therefore, comrnitted against the laws of the United
States, out of the limits of a State, is not local, but may be tried
at such place as Congress shall designate by law.
This furnishes an answer to tht argument against the jurisdiction of the court, as it respects venue, trial in the county,
and J.1ry from the vicinage, as well as in respect to the necessity of particular or fixed districts before the offence.
These considerations have no application or be axing upon the
question.
In this case, by the annexation of the Indian country to the
State of Arkansas, in pursuance of the act of 1844, for the
punishment of crimes committed in that country, the place of
indictment and trial was in the Circuit Court of the United
States for that State, in which the indictnaent has been found,
and was pending in 1851, when the Wes,:ern District was set
off; and as that change did not affect the jurisdiction of the
court, as it respected pending cases, but remained the same
after the alteration of the district as before, it follows that
the trial of the indictment in this court will be at the place
and in the court as prescribed by law, which is all that is required in the case of an offence committed out of the limits of a
State.
We shall direct, therefore, an answer in the negative, to be
certified to the court below, to the fst question sent up for our
decision, as we are of opinion the court possesses jurisdiction to
hear and give judgment on the indictment.
The second question sent up in the division of opinion is as
follows:
Can the District Court of the United. States, for the Western
District of Arkansas, take jurisdiction of the case aforesaid, upon
the indictment aforesaid, so found, in the year 1845, in said
Circuit Court, for the District 6f Arkansas ?
As our conclusion upon the first question supersedes the necessity of passing upon the second, it will be unnecessary to
examine it, and shall, therefore, confine our answer and certi.
fiqate to the court below to the first.

DE

TERM, 1853.

489

United States v. Dawson et al.

Mr. Justice M\cLEAN dissented.
Mr. Justice McLEAN,
The facts and law of this case, as I understand them, have
led me to a different conclusion from that of a majority of the
court. The twenty-fourth section of the act of the 30th June,
1834, after making various provisions, defining the limits of the
Indian country, and imposing penalties for several offences by
white persons, provides, "that for the sole purpose of carrying
this act into effect, the Indian country, bounded east by Arkansas and Missouri, west by Mexico, north by the Osage country,
and south by Red River, shall be, and hereby is, anhexed to the
Territory of Arkansas."
On the 8th of July, 1844, a murder was committed at the
Creek agency, in the Creek country, west of Arkansas, for which
the grand jury found a bill of indictment in the Circuit Court of
Arkansas, at April term, 1845.
By an act of March 3, 1851, it is provided, "that from and
after the passage of this act, the counties of Benton, Washington, Crawford, Scott, Polk, Franklin, Johnson, Madison, and
Carroll, and all that part of the Indian country lying within the
present judicial district of Arkansas, shall constitute a new judicial district, to be styled, the Western District of Arkansas; and
the residue of said State shall be and remain a judicial district,
to be styled, the Eastern District of Arkansas."
After the division of the district, Dawson, the aefendant, was
arrested for the alleged murder; and the question, whether the
Circuit Court of the United States, sitting within the Eastern
Diftrict, has jurisdiction to try the case, has been referred to this
court.
Wrhen the offence was committed, and the indictment was
found, the District of Arkansas included the State and the Indian country described; but when the defendant was arrested,
and the c.se was called for trial, the district had been divided;
and the question is raised in the Eastern District, the murder
having been committed in the Western.
In the act dividing the district, Congress had power to provide that all offences, committed in the district before the
division, should be tried in the Eastern District. But no such
provision being made, the question is, whether the jurisdiction
may be exercised in that district without it.
Since the division of the distriet. capital punishments have
been inflicted in the Western District for offences conimitted
before the division. This deprived the accused of no rights
which they could claim under the Constitution of theUnited
States, or the laws of the Union. The sixth article 6f the

490

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson et al.

amendment to the Constitution declares that, "in all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and
public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district
wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district
shall have been previously ascertained by law."
As the State and distric-L are connected by the copulative
conjunction, in this pfovision, the case before us is not technically within it. The crime is alleged to have been committed
within the Indian' country, which the district includes, but it is
not within the State. But the case appears to me to be within
the policy of the provision. Nine counties of the State of Arkansas are within the district, and from which the jury to try
the defendant might be, summoned. This brings the case substantially within the above provision. Had the place of the
rmurder been within one of the above counties, the constitutional
provisions must have governed the case. All the rights guaranteed by the Constitution would have been secured to the criminal by a trial in the Western District; but those rights are not
realized by him on a trial in the Eastern District. And that is
made the place of trial because the alleged murder was not
committed within the State.
In the 2d section of the 3d article of the Constitution, it is
declared that "the trials of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the
State where the said crimes shall have been committed; but,
when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at such
place or places as the Congress may by law have directed."
The latter clause of this provision covers the case now before
us. The crime charged was not committed within any State;
but it was committed within a district, within which such
offences are to be tried, as "directed by Congress." And there
seems to me to be no authority to try suci an offender in any
other district, or at any other place. The act of 1834 provides
that an offender, under the act, when arrested, should be sent for
trial to the district where jurisdiction may be exercised.
The punishments inflicted in the Western District of Arkansas, for crimes committed before the div.ision of the district,
were in accordance with the above provision of the Constitution and the principles of the common law, both of which are
opposed to a trial of the same offences in the Eastern District.
The tribunal is the same in both districts, except the circuit
judge may-not be bound to attend the Western District; but the
Western District includes the place of the crime which, by the
laws of England and of this country, is the criterion of jurisdiction in criminal cases. This is never departed from. where
the limits of the jurisdiction are prescribed.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.

United States v. Dawson et al.

On what ground can jurisdiction, be exercised in the Eastern
District ? Not, I presume, on the ground that the crime was
committed before the district was divided. If this be assumed
and sustained, the capital punishments which have been inflicted in the Western District, for similar offences, have been
without authority. The offenders have been tried, and they
have had, substantially, the benefits secured by the Constitution. They have had a jury from the district, and as near the
vicinage as practicable. These privileges they would not have
realized had they been tried in the Eastern District. If tried in
the Eastern District, the jury must have been summoned from
that district, and not from the district in which the offence was
committed. The considerations in favor of the Western District, as the legiA place of trial, greatly outweigh, it seems to
me, any that can arise in favor of the Eastern District.
There is, however, a fact which'may be supposed of great
weight in deciding the question; and that is, the indictment
was found before the division, of the district. I will examine
this. It is admitted the jurisdiction was in the Circuit Court
for the entire district, whell the indictment was found. This
gave jurisdiction; but every step taken in the cause, subsequent
to the finding of the bill, is as much the exercise of jurisdiction
as the finding of the bill.
The establishment of the Western District, in effect, repealed
the jurisdiction of the Eastern District, as to causes of action
arising in the Western District, as fully as if the law had declared, "no jurisdiction shall hereafter be taken in any case,
civil or criminal, which is of a local character, and arises in the
Western District. Offences committed in that district are made
local by the acts of Congress. This is not a case where, if
jurisdiction once attaches, the court may finally determine the
matter. There seems to me to be no reason for such a rule in
a criminal case, especially when it is opposed to the policy of
the Constitution and to the principles of common law.
A case lately decided in this court may have some bearing
on this question. Under the fugitive slave law of 1793, certain
penalties were inflicted for aiding a fugitive from labor to escape. A number of actions were brought in several of the
States - in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan-for the recovery of
this penalty; but it was set up in defence, that this penalty was
repealed by repugnant provisions in the law of 1850, on the §ame
subject, and this court so held. The actions which had been
pending for years were stricken from the docket. But it may
be said the repeal, in the case stated, operated on the right of
action. This is admitted. And so, it may be said, the Westtern District was repugnant to the Eastern, so far as causes of

492

SUPREME COURT.
United States v. Dawson

(t

al.

local actions arise in the Western District; and is not this repugnancy as fatal to the trial, as the repeal of thb penalty in
the act of 1793 ?
All this difficulty arises from an omission of Congress to
make, in the law dividing the district, the necessary provision;
and it appears to me that we have no power, by construction or
otherwise, to supply the omission. This could not be done in
_ writ of possession, in such a case,
an action of ejectment A
could not be issued to the Western District on a judgment entered in the Eastern. And if such a jurif3diction could not be
sustained in a civil action, much less could it be sustained in a
criminal case.
If a person guilty of a crime. in the Indian country, before
the division, could not be indicted and tried in the Eastern District, it follows, that the fact of the crime having been committed in the Indian country, can afford no ground of jurisdiction
in the present case. It must rest alone, then, it would seem, for
jurisdiction, on the ground that, the indictment having been
found in the Eastern District, the same juisdiction may try the
defendants, and, if found guilty, sentence them to be executed.
This view must overcome the locality of the crime, and the
right which the defendants may claim, to have a jury as near
the vicinage as practicable, at least a jury from the district
where the crime was committed. These appear to me to be
objections entitled to great consideration. A jurisdiction in so
important a case should not be maintained under reasonable
doubts of its legality.
The cases referred-to in the argument to retain the jurisdiction, do not, as it appears to me, overcome the objections. Numerous instances are cited where the territory of a judicial district
has been changed, provision being made in the act, that the
jurisdiction should be continued where suits had been commenced. This shows'th; necessity of such a provision, and is
an argument against the exercise of the jurisdiction, where no
provision has been made. And in those cases, like the present,
where a district has been changed, without any provision, as to
jurisdiction, there is no exercise of it shown, in a criminal case,
especially where the punishment is death.
Where jurisdiction attaches from the citizenship of the parties, a change of residence does not affect the jurisdiction. The
case of Tyrell v. Roundtree, 7 Peters, 464, seems to have no
bearing upon this question. That action was commenced by
an attachment, which was laid upon the land before the division
of the county; and this court said, the leand remained in the
custody of the officer subject to the judgment of the court. An
intereset was vesated in him for the purposes of that judgment.

DECEMBER TERM, 1853.
United States v. Dawson et al.

The judgment was not a general lien on it, but was a specific
appropriation of the property itself. And they say the division
of the county could not divest this vested interest, or deprive the
officer of the power to finish a process, which was rightly
begun.
There may be cases where counties have been divided after
jurisdiction was taken in a local action, and the suit has been
carried into judgment, but such cases afford no authority in the
present case.
The case relied upon as in point in 4 Washington C. C. R~p
725, the court said, "at the first or second session of this court,
which succeeded the passage of the act of 1824, which added
this and other counties to the western judicial district, we were
called upon to decide, whether the present action, together with
some others, then on our docket for trial, together with the papers blelonging to them, should be sent to the Western District
or retained here. After hearing counsel on the question, the
opinion of the court was, that those cases were not embraced
either by the word or by the obvious intention and policy of
the act."
This does not appear to be a well-considered case. The
counties were annexed to another jurisdiction, and yet the court
speak of "1the obvious intention and policy of the act," and on
that ground entertain jurisdiction over cases pending in the
former district. This was right in regard te transitory actions,
but not where +',P actions were of a local character.
Order.
This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States, for the Eastern District of Arkansas, and on the points or questions, on
vhich the judges of the said Circuit Court were opposed in
opinion, and which were certified to this court for its opinion,
ar eeably to the act of Congress, in such case made and provided and was argued by counsel. On consideration whereof, it
is the opinion of this court, that the act of Congress entitled
"An act-to divide the District of Arkansas into two judicial districts," approved the third day of March, in the year of our Lord
one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, whereby the Western
District of Arkansas was created and defined, did not take away
the powdr and jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Arkansas, so that it can proceed to hear, try, and determine a prosecution for murder, pending against the prisoner, James L. Dawson, a white man and
not an Indian, upon an indictment, found, presented, and reVOL. XV.

Where land was sold in New Jersey by order of the Orphars Court of one of the
counties, the conveyance was made not to the actual bilders, but to a person whom
'they-appointed to represent them.
Afterwards, the Supreme Court of the State having decided that such a practice was
irregular, the legislature passed a law enacting tat, upon proof of the absence of
fraud, such deeds might be given in evidence. This cured the defect in the title.
The purchasers were a company organized for the purpose of improvingthe land, and
in their purchase there was neither actual or constructive fraud.
The law examined with respect to the bidding of associations at sales by public auction.
In this instance the price obtained was greatei than any revious estimate of the value
of the property.
There was no constructive fraud because, according to tLe evidence, the guardian of
the minor. children and the commissioners who decided that the property ought
to be sold, did not become interested in the company until some time after the sale.
The circumstance that these persons became interested in the companybefore the first
half of the purchase-money was due, is not a sufficient reason for setting aside the
sale.
According to.the preponderance of the evidence, the grave charge that the auctioneer
who made the sale was one of the company, is not sustained.
