MOORE

v.

ROBBINS.

[Sup. Ct,

Opinion of the court.

MOORE V. ROBBINS.
A decree in a court below, reversing a decree where, on a bill to foreclose a
mortgage, a court below it had decreed in favor of the complainant, and
"remanding " the case to such inferior court for "such other and further
proceedings as to law and justice shall appertain," is not a final decree
within either the Judiciary Act of 1789 or the act of 1867 amendatory
of it. A writ taken on a contrary assumption dismissed.
ON

motion by Mr. R. E. Williams (the plaintiff in error

himself opposing), to dismiss a writ of error to the Supreme
Court of Illinois; the ground of the motion being that no
final judgment or decree had been rendered.
Mr. Justice SWAYNE stated the case, and delivered the
opinion of the court.
The suit was a bill in equity, filed by Robbins in the Circuit Court of Do Witt County to foreclose a mortgage.
That court decreed in favor of complainant. The defendants removed the case by appeal to the Supreme Court of
the State. There the decree of the lower court was reversed
and the case was " remanded to the Circuit Court for such
other and further proceedings as to law and justice shall
appertain." The ground of reversal does not appear in the
record. A rehearing was applied for by the defendants and
granted by the court. The case was reheard and the former
decree was affirmed. The defendants thereupon prosecuted
this writ and are the plaintiffs in error in this court.
Both the Judiciary Act of 1789,* and the amendatory act
of 1867,t limit the jurisdiction of this court in this class of
cases to final judgments and decrees. The decree of the
Supreme Court of Illinois before us is not of that character.1
WRIT DISMISSED.
Section 25, 1 Stat. at Large, 85.
