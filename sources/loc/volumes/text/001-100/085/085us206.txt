THE DELAWARE RAILROAD TAX.
[MINOT v. THE PHILADELPHIA, WILMINGTON AND BALTIMORE
RAILROAD COMPANY AND OTHERS.]

1. Although it has been repeatedly held by this court that the legislature of
a State may exempt particular parcels of property or the property of
particular persons or corporations from taxation, either for a specified
period or perpetually, or may limit the amount or rate of taxation to
which such property shall be subjected, and that when such immunity
is conferred, or such limitation is prescribed by the charter of a corporation, it becomes a part of the contract, and is equally inviolate with
its other stipulations; yet before any such exemption or limitation can be
admitted, the intent of the legislature to confer the immunity or prescribe the limitation must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt. All
public grants are strictly construed, and nothing can be taken against
the State by presumption or inference. The established rule of construction in such cases is that rights, privileges, and immunities not
expressly granted are reserved.
2. Accordingly, a provision in an act of the legislature of Delaware, under
which the original Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company
was united with the Delaware and Maryland Railroad Company, requiring the new company to pay annually into the treasury of the State
a tax of one-quarter of one per cent. upon its capital stock of $400,000
did not prevent a subsequent legislature from imposing a further or
different tax upon the company. The amount designated was only a
declaration of the tax payable annually until a different rate should be
established.
S. By an act of the legislature of Maryland, passed in 1831, and its supplement, a corporation called the Delaware and Maryland Railroad Company was created, with authority to construct and maintain a railroad
from a point on the Delaware and Maryland line to some point on the
Susquehanna River; and by the nineteenth section of the act it was
provided that the shares of the capital stock of the company should be
exempt from the imposition of any tax or burden by the State assenting to the act, except upon that portion of the permanent and fixed
works of the company, which might be within the State of Maryland.
By an act of the legislature of Delaware, passed in 1832, and its supplement, another corporation was created, called the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company, with authority to construct and maintain
a railroad from a point on the boundary line of Pennsylvania and Delaware to the city of Wilmington, and thence towards the Susquehanna
in the direction of Baltimore. In 1835 these two companies were, under
;cts of the legislatures of Maryland and Delaware, consolidated into
one company, under the name of the latter-the Wilmington and Sus-

quebanna Railroad Company. The act of Delaware, authorizing the
consolidation on her part, provided that the holders of the stocks of the
two companies should, when consolidated, hold, possess, and enjoy all
the property, rights, and privileges, and exercise all the power granted
to, and vested in, the companies, or either of them, by that law, or any
other law or laws of that State, or of Maryland. The act of Maryland,
authorizing the consolidation on her part, contained a similar provision.
Held, that the purpose of the two provisions was to vest in the new
company the rights and privileges which the original companies had
previously possessed under their separate charters; the rights and privileges in Maryland which the Maryland company had there enjoyed, and
the rights and privileges in Delaware which the Delaware company had
there enjoyed ; not to transfer to either State and enforce therein the
legildation of the other. The new company, after the consolidation,
stood in each State as the original company had previously stood in that
State, invested with the same rights, and subject to the same liabilities.
The act of consolidation, so far as Delaware was concerned, had only
this effect.
4. The consolidated company abovementioned was, in 1838, united with
two other railroad companies, one called the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad Company, chartered by the legislature of Maryland in
1831, with authority to construct and maintain a railroad from Baltimore to Port Deposit, on the Susquehanna River; and the other called
the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, chartered by the legislature of Pennsylvania in the same year, with authority
to construct and maintain a railroad from Philadelphia to the Delaware
State line. These three companies were, under acts of the legislatures
of these States, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, consolidated
into one company with a common stock, retaining as its corporate name
the name of the company chartered by Pennsylvania. The act of the
legislature of Delaware, under which the consolidation was effected, declared that the respective companies should "constitute one company,
.nd be entitled to all the rights, privileges, and immunities which each
and all of them possess, have, and enjoy, under and by virtue of their
respective charters." Held, that this latter provision in no respect
changed the position with reference to taxation of the new company, in
one of the States, from that of the old company in such State.
6. An act of the legislature of Delaware, taxing railroad and canal companies, was passed on the 8th of April, 1869. The fourth section of the
act provided that every company of the class designated should, in addition to other taxes, also pay to the treasurer of the State for its use, on
the first day of July then next, and on the first day of July of each
year thereafter, or within thirty days from such period, a tax of onefourth of one per cent. upon the actual cash value of every share of its
capital stock; with a proviso that when the line of the railroad or canal
belonging to a company liable to the tax lay partly in the State and
partly in an adjoining State or States, the company should only be re.

quired to pay the tax on such number of the shares of its capital stock
as would be in that proportion to the whole number of shares, which,
the length of the road or canal within the limits of the State shoul L.
bear to the whole length of such road or canal. Held,
1st. That the tax was not imposed upon the shares of the individual stockholders, or upon the property of the corporation, but was a tax upon the
corporation itself, measured by a percentage upon the cash value of a.
certain proportional part of the shares of its capital stock,-a rule which,
though an arbitrary one, was approximately just in the case.
2d. That the tax did not conflict with the power of Congress to regulatecommerce among the several States, nor interfere with the right of
transit of persons and property from one State into or through another.
6. The State may impose taxes upon the corporation as an entity existing.
under its laws, as well as upon the capital stock of the corporation or itsseparate corporate property. And the manner in which its value shall
be assessed and the rate of taxation, however arbitrary or capricious,
are mere matters of legislative discretion.
7. A tax upon a corporation may be proportioned to the income received as.
well as to the value of the franchise granted or the property possessed.
8. The fact that taxation increases the expenses attendant upon the use or
possession of the thing taxed, of itself constitutes no objection to itsconstitutionality.
9. The exercise of the authority which every State possesses to tasx its corporations and all their property, real and personal, and their franchises,
and to graduate the tax upon the corporations according to their business or income, or the value of their property, when this is not done by
discriminating against rights held in other States, and the tax is not on,
imports or tonnage, or transportation to other States, cannot be regarded
as conflicting with any constitutional power of Congress.

day of January then next, and on the first day of January

of each year afterwards, pay to the treasurer of the State for
the use of the State, in addition to the taxes then imposed
by law upon such companies, a tax of three per cent. upon their
net earnings or income received from all sources during the preceding year; with a proviso, that when a line of railroad or
canal belonging to any company liable to the tax lay partly
in the State and partly in an adjoining State or States, the
part or share of such net earnings or income of the company
only should be subject to the tax, as would be in that proportion to the whole net earnings or income of the company,
which the length of the road or canal within the limits of
the State should bear to the whole length of such road or
canal.
The fourth section of the act provided that every company of the class designated should, in addition to other
taxes, also pay to the treasurer of the State for its use, on
the first day of July then next, and on the first (lay of July
of each year thereafter, or within thirty days from such period, a tax of one-fourth of one per cent. upon the actual cash
value of every share of its capital stock; with a proviso similar
in its character to that of the first section, namely, that when
the line of the railroad or canal belonging to a company
liable to the tax lay partly in the State and partly in an adjoining State or States, the company should only be required
to pay the tax on such number of the shares of its capital
stock as would be in that proportion to the whole number
of shares, which the length of the road or canal within the
limits of the State should bear to the whole length of such
road or canal.
Another section of the act further provided that every
railroad company should also pay to the State treasurer on
the first day of January then next, and on the first day of
January of each year thereafter, or within thirty days from
such period, for the use in the State of every locomotive belonging in whole or in part to the company, and used by it
at any time during the preceding year, a tax of $100; and
for the like use of each passenger car thus owned and used,

a tax of $25, and of each freight car and truck thus owned
and used, a tax of $10.
The act required the president or treasurer of every company liable to these several taxes, to furnish the State treasurer with statements showing its net earnings or income
from all sources during the preceding year, the number of
I comotives, passenger cars, freight cars of every description, and trucks belonging to the company and used by it in
the State at any time during that period, and the number of
shares of the capital stock of the company, with an estimate
and appraisement of the actual cash value of each share, and
to pay the taxes chargeable. The act also made provision
for an estimate of the earnings and an assessment of the
taxes in case the statement required was not furnished, and
for the collection of the taxes by sale of the property of the
company, if they were not voluntarily paid.
The defendant, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, is a corporation created under the
laws of Delaware, so far as it exists in that State. By connection with other companies with which under one common
name it is consolidated by the legislation of Pennsylvania
and Maryland, hereafter particularly mentioned, its road
extends to Philadelphia in one State, and to Baltimore in the
other. It is, therefore, a corporation liable to taxation by
the terms of the act of April 8th, 1869, and is within the
provisos of both its first and fourth sections.
The tax upon this company, imposed by the fourth section, became due for the first time in July, 1869, and in
October following, in response to demands of the State
treasurer, the president of the company furnished to that
officer a statement showing that the capital stock of the
company consisted of 186,088 shares of the value of $50
each, accompanied by a protest against the legality of the
tax. Soon afterwards, Minot, the complainant, a citizen of
Massachusetts, and a stockholder in the company, addressed
a written communication to its president inquiring whether
the company intended to protect his interests as a stock
holder by resisting the collection of the tax, and stating that

as the taxwas not a legal one protection against its levy
should be provided. This communication was submitted to
the directors, who, in answer, resolved that while they protested against the legality of the tax, they declined to take
the responsibility of interfering to prevent its collection,
leaving the stockholders at liberty to assert their rights in
-such way as they might think proper. Minot thereupon
filed the present bill. Though the immediate occasion of the
bill was the apprehended attempt on the part of the State
-of Delaware to enforce the tax imposed upon the company
by the fourth section of the act of April 8th, 1869, the cornplainant charged that all the taxes imposed by the act in question were illegal, and sought to have the legislation imposing them, so far as it affected the Philadelphia, Wilmington,
and Baltimore Railroad, the corporation defendant, declared
to be unconstitutional and invalid and the collection of the
-taxes enjoined.
The Circuit Court adjudged the tax imposed for the use
-of the rolling stock to be invalid, and enjoined its enforcement, but sustained the legality of the other taxes, and a
decree in conformity with this ruling was entered, from
which both parties appealed to this court. On the hearing
in this court the State officers of Delaware withdrew their
appeal, and the inquiry of the court was thus limited to the
validity of the act of April, 1869, so far as it imposed the
taxes specified in its first and fourth sections.
The invalidity of that act, so far as it imposed these taxes
,upon the defendant corporation, was asserted upon the following grounds:
1st. That it violated the contract between the State of
Delaware and the company contained in the charter of the
latter.
2d. That it imposed taxes upon property beyond the jurisdiction of the State.
3d. That it conflicted with the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the several States; and,
4th. That it interfered with the right of transit for persons
and property from one State into or through another.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

The defendant corporation, as already mentioned, was
formed by union with companies chartered by other States,
and to understand fully the positions of the appellant, reference must be had to the original corporations, and the
legislation by which they were created. By an act of the
legislature of Maryland, passed in 1831, and its supplement,
a corporation called the Delaware and Maryland Railroad
Company was created, with authority to construct and maintain a railroad from a point on the Delaware and Maryland
line to some point on the Susquehanna River; and by the
nineteenth section of the act it was provided that the shares
of the capital stock of the company should be exempt from the imposition of any tax or burden by the State's assenting to the act,
except upon that portion of the permanent and fixed works of the
company, which might be within the Slate of Maryland. By an
act of the legislature of Delaware, passed in 1832, and its
supplement, another corporation was created, called the
Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company, with authority to construct and maintain a railroad from a point on
the boundary line of Pennsylvania and Delaware to the city
of Wilmington, and thence towards the Susquehanna in the
direction of Baltimore to the Delaware and Maryland line.
The act provided that the company should pay annually into
the treasury of the State a tax of eight per cent. on the
dividends exceeding six per cent. of the capital stock actually paid in.
In 1835 these two companies were, under acts of the legislatures of Maryland and Delaware, consolidated into one
company, under the name of the latter-the Wilmington
and Susquehanna Railroad Company. The act of Delaware,
authorizing the consolidation on her part, provided that the
holders of the stocks of the two companies should, when consoli.
dated, hold, possess, and enjoy all the property, rights, and privileges, and exercise all the power granted to, and vested in, the companies, or either of them, by that law, or any other law or laws of
that State, or of Maryland. The act of Maryland, authorizing
the consolidation on her part, contained a similar provision.
The act of Delaware, at the same time, repealed the pro.

vision in the charter of the original Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company, requiring the payment of the
tax of eight per cent. on the dividends exceeding six per
cent. of the capital stock actually paid in, and provided that
the consolidated company should pay annually into the treasury
of the State, a tax of one-quarter of one per cent. on its capital
stock of four hundred thousand dollars, the tax to be paid in semiannual instalments, on the first of January and July of each

year.
This consolidated company was, in 1838, united with two
other railroad companies, one called the Baltimore and Port
Deposit Railroad Company, chartered by the legislature of
Maryland in 1831, with authority to construct and maintain
a railroad from Baltimore to Port Deposit, on the Susquehanna River; and the other called the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Company, chartered by
the legislature of Pennsylvania in the same year, with authority to construct and maintain a railroad from Philadelphia to the Delaware State line. These three companies.
were, under acts of the legislatures of these States, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, consolidated into one
company with a common stock, retaining as its corporate
name the name of the company chartered by Pennsylvania.
The act of the legislature of Delaware, under which the consolidation was effected, declared that the respective companies should "constitute one company, and be entitled to
all the rights, privileges, and immunities which each and all of
them possess, have, and enjoy, under and by virtue of their respective charters."
Previous to the consolidation, the three companies had
constructed and were operating their respective railroads,
which, together, formed a connected line of railroad from
Philadelphia to Baltimore, vid Wilmington, excepting the
interval between the eastern terminus of the Baltimore and
Port Deposit railroad, on the western bank of the Susquehanna, and the western terminus of the Wilmington and
Susquehanna railroad, on the eastern bank of the same
river, which interval was supplied by a ferry; but the line

was inferior in structure and equipment to that since main-,
tained by the consolidated company.
Since the consolidation, the Philadelphia, Wilmington,
and Baltimore Railroad Company had built a bridge across
the Susquehanna, in the State of Maryland, at a great expense, and had thus established and now maintains a continuous railroad route between Philadelphia and Baltimore,
and had expended large sums in laying an additional main
track, sidings and turnouts, and in building depots and stations, and in furnishing an adequate equipment of rollingstock. The capital stock of the company when the bill was
filed was represented by 186,088 fully paid shares of the par
value of $50 each, of which 184,524 shares were held by persons who were neither citizens nor residents of Delaware.
The capital stock of the Maryland and Pennsylvania companies, previous to and at the time of the consolidation of
these companies with the Delaware company, represented
real and personal estate of great value (locally situated in
these States) belonging to stockholders not domiciled in
Delaware.
The entire length of the railroad of the consolidated Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Company, including a branch in the State of Maryland, known as the
Port Deposit Branch, is 97..4 miles, of which 23 8 miles
are in the State of Delaware; but the value of the property
of the company locally situated in the State of Delaware is
much less than 2301 of its entire property; the bridge across
the Susquehanna, in the State of Maryland, representing
alone an expenditure exceeding $1,500,000, and the value
of the depot and station grounds, in the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland, with the buildings and structures
thereon, exceeding 3666 of the value of the entire depot and
station property of the company.

THE DELAWARE RAILROAD
TAX.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument against the tax.

bg the act of April 8th, 1869,
was a violation of the contract
between the Stale of

Delaware and the company
contained in, the
charter of the tatter.
There is no doubt that
a State may by contract exempt
particular property from
taxation. All that is necessary
is
that the language of the
contract be plain, and the
purpose
to relinquish unquestionable.
The exemption relied on
in
the present case is not founded
on an ordinary charter. In
assenting to the creation
and organization of the
present
Philadelphia, Wilmington
and Baltimore Railroad
Company, the State of Delaware
contracted with corporations
and citizens of other States
whose property was not in
any
way subject to her power
of taxation. The question
to
be
determined was not so much
as to what right of taxation
should be relinquished by
the State, as to what right
of taxation should be assumed
by it. It can scarcely be
thought
that the negotiation between
the State of Delaware and
the
foreign corporations, proceeded
on the basis that the State
,of Delaware would, in the
absence of any provision
on the
subject, acquire an unlimited
right to tax the franchises
of
these corporations. If such
a theory had been entertained,
it would necessarily have
occurred to the parties interested
that the States of Maryland
and Pennsylvania could
exercise the same prerogative,
and that the proposed corporation
would be subjected to'the
taxation of three distinct
sovereignties in none of which
would the corporators be
adequately represented.
When, then, the State of
Delaware prescribed the
terms
of taxation on which she
would consent to the proposed
consolidation, these terms
may fairly be considered,
not in
the light of the release,
but in that of the acquisition
of a
privilege; so fa', indeed,
as the foreign companies
were
concerned.
What now are the provisions
of the charter on the subject
of taxation ?
By the original act of incorporation
of the Wilmington
and Susquehanna Railroad
Company (act of January
18th,
1832), the company was
required to pay an annual
tax of

(Oct. 1873.]

THE

Argument against the tax.

,eight per cent. ou all dividends which mayexceed six per
-centum on the capital stock actually paid in, and this was the
only measure of taxation specifically prescribed in the act.
Such being the status of the company, the act of July
24th, 1835, providing for its consolidation with the Delaware
and Maryland Railroad Company of Maryland, repealed
this provision of the original act, and then enacted that the
'consolidated company "shall pay annually into the treasury
,of the State a tax of one-quarter of one per cent. on the
,capital stock thereof of $400,000; the said tax to be paid
-semi-annually, &c., in each and every year hereafter. This
!provision, we contend, meant that the tax on capital stock,
for which the consolidated company was to be liable, should
be that specified, viz., a quarter of one per cent. on the sum
,of $400,000, and that no greater or other tax should there:after be imposed on its capital. This tax was to be imposed annually thereafter; that is, annually during the exist-ence of the consolidated corporation. A suggestion that
the State of Delaware might, immediately after the Maryland company had accepted the terms on which it was
authorized to unite with the Delaware company, impose a
,more onerous rate of taxation on the capital stock of the
united companies than that specified, would undoubtedly
have been treated as an injurious imputation on the good
faith of the legislature of Delaware.
Doubtless it may be said that notwithstanding that the
:act specified the tax which it would lay, it did so without
,saying that no further or different tax should ever be laid,
:and that, therefore, a further and different one may be laid.
;Such seems to have been the doctrine held by the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania in The Easton Bank v. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,* where it was said that a bank re.chartered under a law relating to it and a number of other
banks, which provided that dividends should be taxed at a
,certain rate, was not exempt from the operation of a subse,quent general law which increased the tax on dividends.

THE, DELAWARE RAILROAD TAX.

[Sup. CL,

Argument against the tax.

But the doctrine is met and denied by this court in a case
decided since the case in Pennsylvania; the case of Raleigh,
and Gaston Railroad Company v. Reid.* There the charter
contained an exemption from taxation for a term of fifteen,
years; but, after the expiration of this limitation, the legislature was to be at liberty to tax the individual shares of the
stockholders whenever their annual profits exceeded eight
per cent., provided that the tax did not exceed twenty-five
cents a share per annum; and it was held that a tax levied
on the company after the expiration of the fifteen years, but
before the annual profits had reached eight per cent., was a
violation of the contract. " When a statute," said Davis, J.,
in delivering the opinion of this court, " limits a thing to
be done in a particular mode, it includes a negative of any
other mode." Is not this case in point? The legislature
had asserted its right to tax the stock in a particular way
after the expiration of a certain period, but it had not expressly said that it would not tax the stock in some other
way, or that it would not tax the lands or personal property
of the company; but the court held that the mode of taxation specified in the charter excluded any other mode. In
the present case the legislature agreed that the tax on the
capital stock of the consolidated company should be one.
thousand dollars a year, and by so doing did they not agree
that it should not be ten thousand dollars, or twenty thousand dollars, or anything else than one thousand dollars?
Indeed in Pennsylvania in a case much later than that of
the Easton Bank,t the same court that made the decision
there, declared the following to be one of the conclusions
derivable from a review of the decisions of this court on,
the subject of charter contracts between the State and corporations:
"If the legislature, in creating a corporation, prescribe a rate
of taxation, and expressly release the power to impose further
taxes, or do not expressly reserve the power to themselves, a subse18 Wallace, 269; and see Home of the Friendless v.Rouse, 8 Id. 481, andi

Argument against the tax.

quent tax law does impair the obligation of the contract, and is
void."
A conclusion which is plainly inconsistent with the decision in the Easton Bank case.
But the contract immunity from taxation claimed for the
capital stock of the present consolidated Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company rests on othei
grounds.
The Maryland act by which the "Delaware and Maryland
Railroad Company" was incorporated contained the following provision:
"And the shares of the capital stock of said company shall
be deemed and considered personal estate, and shall be exempt
from the imposition of any tax or burden by the State's assentingto
this law, except upon that portion of the permanent and fixed works
of said company which may lie within the State of Maryland."
The Delaware act of July 24th, 1835, providing for consolidation of the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad
Company of Delaware with the Delaware and Maryland
Railroad Company of Delaware, declared that the two companies, when consolidated, should be styled "The Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company," and that by and
under that corporate name the holders of the stock of the
said railroad companies should
"Hold, possess, and enjoy all the property, rights, and privileges,
and exercise all the powers granted to and vested in the said railroad
companies, or either of them, by this or any other law or laws of this
State or of the State of Maryland."
These terms are as broad and general as they could be
made. The consolidated company was to possess every
right and privilege which either of the original companies possessed or enjoyed under any law of Maryland or Delaware.
It was not said that the consolidated company should possess and enjoy every right, privilege, &c., which the laws of
Delaware conferred on the Delaware company. The purport and effect of the act is, "that they shall, when united,

THE DELAWARE RAILROAD TAX.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument against the tax.

have all the rights and immunities in this State (Delaware)
which each of them had in the State by which it was chartered." It is true that the phrase, "in this State," is not
actually used; but the legislature which passed the act was
the legislature of Delaware, and they were confirming rights
and privileges to be exercised and enjoyed in Delaware, and
not elsewhere. We, therefore, contend that, as immunity
from taxation of its capital stock was a privilege which the
Maryland company enjoyed, the consolidated company succeeded to the same immunity. The stock of the Delaware
and Maryland Railroad Company is now represented by and
forms an integral part of the stock of the consolidated company, and when the stock of the latter company is taxed
that of the former is taxed also. The theory that the Delaware act of consolidation was merely intended to secure to
the consolidated company all the privileges in Maryland
which the Maryland company possessed, and in Delaware
a',l the privileges which the Delaware company formerly
possessed, disregards the terms of the Delaware act, and imputes to the Delaware legislature the assumption of legislative power in the State of Maryland.
It is true that the exemption from taxation contained in
the original charter of the Delaware and Maryland Railroad
Company referred to Maryland taxation only; but still it
was an exemption from State taxation, and as such a privilege of the company; and when this, with all other privileges of the Maryland company, was conferred upon the
consolidated company in Delaware, the latter company
thereby acquired the privilege of exemption of its capital
stock from State taxation, and that in Delaware meant Delaware State taxation.
2d. The tax on capitalstock imposed by the fourth section of the
act of April 8th, 1869, was an unlawful usurpation by the Slate
of Delaware of the right to tax property beyond its jurisdiction.
The tax is imposed, in the first instance, upon the actual
cash value of every share of the capital stock of every railroad and every canal company in Delaware; but with a proviso that where the line of railroad or canal belonging to

any company liable to the tax lies partly in Delaware and
partly in an adjoining State or States, "such company shall
only be required to pay the tax aforesaid on such numbei
of the shares of its capital stock as will be in that propor.
tion to the whole number of shares of such capital stock
which the length of said railroad or canal within the limit.
of this State bears to the whole length of such railroad or
canal."
The tax, therefore, whether considered as a tax upon,
shares of stock as representing the property of the corporation, or as representing the property of the individual stockholders, was not imposed upon the Delaware property of the
corporation or upon property of the Delaware stockholders.
only; and if it can be sustained at all, must be sustained oil
a theory which would sustain the taxation of the entire capital stock of the company by each of the three States of
Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, irrespective of the.
amount invested in each State, or of the residence of thestockholders. For it is obvious that any apportionment of
taxation according to the mileage of the road in each State
must be purely arbitrary. No one would expect to find that
the ratio of mileage of the road in Delaware, to its entire
length, was the same as that of the capital invested in Delaware to the entire capital of the company, or that the pro.
portion of Delaware stockholders could be ascertained in,
the same way. In fact, it is admitted in this case, that whilethe entire length of the railroad is 99-746 miles, of which
23-1 are in Delaware, the value of the property of the company locally situated in the State of Delaware is much less
than that which would be indicated by the ratio of these.
figures; and that of the 186,088.shares of the capital stock
of the present company, 184,524 are held by persons who
are neither citizens nor residents of Delaware.
Treating the question then as practically and substantially
whether the State of Delaware can lawfully tax the entire,
capital stock of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore
Railroad Company, we have a question which is decisively
answered in the negative by the judgment of this court inB

the, case of Railroad Company v. Jackson.* It was there held
that "a State has no power to tax the interest on bonds
secured in this case by mortgage given by a railroad corporation, and binding every part of the road, when the road
is partially in another State; one road incorporated in two
States." The decision was placed on the ground that to
permit such taxation would be giving effect to State legislation upon property and interests lying beyond the State jurisdiction.
3d. The tax on capital stock imposed by the fourth section of
the act of April 8th, 1869, was a violation of the clause of the
Constitution of the United Slates which confers upon Congress the
power " to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the
several States."
4th. It was an unlawful interference with the constitutional right
of transit for persons and propertyfrom one State into or through
another.
These two points may be considered together.
That the imposition of a tax upon the capital invested in
the railroad between Philadelphia and Baltimore does really
regulate the interstate commerce upon the railroad, seems
evident; and that such a tax does interfere with and burden
the right of passage fbr persons or property from one State
to another may be said to be equally evident.
It is true that the same objections could be made to a
State tax upon the railroad or the capital stock or the earnings of a railroad company where operations were confined
to the territory of the State which levied the tax; and it is
equally true that a tax upon horses and wagons in one State
would to some extent affect commerce between the States.
But the answer to the argument implied by this suggestion
is, that the agencies and instruments of commerce must be
subject to the taxation of the States within whose jurisdiction they exist, and the power of Congress to regulate commerce between the States must ex necessitate, be qualified by
the indirect operation of the exercise of this power as well

as of the State power to regulate its own domestic commerce. Where, however, a State undertakes to tax, even
within its own jurisdiction, interstate commerce, much more
when it undertakes to tax interstate commerce, or the agencies or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, beyond its
jurisdiction, it usurps the prerogative of the Congress of
the United States, and infringes the constitutional rights of
citizens of the United States, since its taxing power does
not extend to such subjects.
If the State of Delaware had, in plain terms, imposed a
tax upon the capital invested in the Pennsylvania and Maryland sections of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, or the earnings derived from the use of
these sections, the tax would probably be admitted by all to
be a burden laid upon interstate commerce or intercourse.
Those who denied it to be such would have to establish that
a tax upon a railroad used almost entirely for commerce and
intercourse between the States was not a tax upon such commerce or intercourse.
The tax actually imposed by the State of Delaware is a
tax upon the railroad in Maryland and Pennsylvania. A
certain portion of the entire capital of the company is taxed,
and that portion represents the railroad in the three States.
It is an admitted fact in this case that the capital thus selected greatly over-represents, the property of the company
locally situated in Delaware. The excess taxed is invested
in Maryland and Pennsylvania. It has already been attempted to be shown that the taxing power of Delaware
cannot be exercised over property beyond its jurisdiction;
and as the property here sought to be taxed is a railroad oxtending through three States and used almost entirely for
interstate intercourse and the earnings of that railroad, we
-submit that this tax is an unconstitutional interference with,
and taxation of, interstate commerce and intercourse.
If this tax can be sustained then it would seem to follow
that Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware can each and all
tax the entire capital and the entire earnings of this one
railroad; and that the same rule would hold good in the

case of a railroad chartered by a much greater number of'
States. The effect of such a system of taxation upon the
commerce and intercourse between the States is too obviousw
to be stated.*
Messrs. T. F. Bayard and E. Saulsbury,for the Stale officers,
of Delaware, contra.
Mr. Justice FIELD, after stating the facts of the case, delivered the opinion of the court, as follows:
It is contended by the appellant that the act of Delaware
of April 8th, 1869, so far as it imposes taxes upon the corporation defendant, violates the contract between the State
and the corporation contained in the charter of the latter.
His position is that the provision, in the act of Delaware of
1835, by which the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad!
Company was united with the Delaware and Maryland Railroad Company, that the new company should pay annually
into the treasury of the State a tax of one-quarter of oneper cent. upon its capital stock of four hundred thousand
dollars, being accepted by the stockholders of the two com-panies by their union into one company, constituted a contract between the new company and the State of Delaware,.
which precluded that State from imposing any greater or
different tax upon the capital stock of the new company;.
and that the provision in the same act of Delaware, that the
new company should possess all the rights and privilegesvested in the original companies, or either of them, by that
law, or any other law of that State or of Maryland, extended.
to the new company the same exemption from taxation on,
its shares of capital stock, which was possessed by the Mary-land corporation under its charter; and that the same limitation upon the taxation of the capital stock, and the same.
immunity of the shares from any taxation, were extended!
to the corporation defendant by the provisions of the act of
Delaware under which this latter company was formed.

Opinion of the court.

That the charter of a private corporation is a contract between the State and the corporators, and within the provision
of the Constitution prohibiting legislation impairing the
obligation of contracts, has been the settled law of this
court since the decision in the Dartmouth College case.*
Nor does it make any difference that the uses of the corporation are public, if the corporation itself be private. The
contract is equally protected from legislative interference,
whether the public be interested in the exercise of its franchise or the charter be granted for the sole benefit of its
corporators. This doctrine is not controverted by any one;
it is the established law; and the question in all cases, when
it becomes necessary to apply it, is whether the particular
legislative interference alleged does in fact impair the obligation of the contract; for it is not every kind of legislative
interference with the powers, action, and property of the
corporation which will have that result.
It has also been repeatedly held by this court that the
legislature of a State may exempt particular parcels of property or the property of particular persons or corporations
from taxation, either for a specified period or perpetually,
or may limit the amount or rate of taxation, to which such
property shall be subjected. And when such immunity is
conferred, or such limitation is prescribed by the charter of
a corporation, it becomes a part of the contract, and is
equally inviolate with its other stipulations. But before
any such exemption or limitation can be admitted, the in.tent of the legislature to confer the immunity or prescribe
the limitation must be clear beyond a reasonable doubt.
All public grants are strictly construed. Nothing can be
taken against the State by presumption or inference. The
established rule of construction in such cases is that rights,
privileges, and immunities not expressly granted are reserved. There is no safety to the public interests in any
other rule. And with special force does the principle, upon
which the rule rests, apply when the right, privilege, or im4 Wheaton, 618

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

munity claimed calls for any abridgment of the powers of
the government, or any restraint upon their exercise. The
power of taxation is an attribute of sovereignty, and is essential to every independent government. As this court has
said, the whole community is interested in retaining it undiminished, and has " a right to insist that its abandonment
ought not to be presumed in a ease in which the deliberate
purpose of the State to abandon it does not appear."* If the
point were not already adjudged it would admit of grave
consideration, whether the legislature of a State can surrender this power, and make its action in this respect binding
upon its successors any more than it can surrender its police
power or its right of eminent domain. But the point being
adjudged, the surrender when claimed must be shown by
clear, unambiguous language, which will admit of no reasonable construction consistent with the reservation of the
power. If a doubt arise as to the intent of the legislature,
that doubt must be solved in favor of the State.
if, now, we apply this rule of construction to the provision
of the act of Delaware, under which the original Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad Company was united with
the Delaware and Maryland Railroad Company, requiring
the new company to pay annually into the treasury of the
State a tax of one-quarter of one per cent. upon its capital
stock of four hundred thousand dollars, the position of the
appellant falls to the ground. That provision is not accompanied with any words indicating the intent of the
legislature that no further or different tax should not be
subsequently levied. Had the provision in question been
embodied in an independent act, no one would pretend that
the designation of the amount and character of the tax carried with it any implication, that the tax should remain unchanged in these particulars for all future time during the
existence of the corporation. And it is not perceived how
a different conclusion is warranted because the tax is designated in an independent section of the act, under which the

new company was formed, instead of being designated in
an independent act. As already observed, nothing can be
taken from the power of the State in this respect by presumption or inference.
IIn the case of The Commonwealth v. The Easton Bank,* we
have an adjudication of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
upon the precise question here presented. The Easton Bank
had been chartered under a general law which prescribed
the payment of taxes on its dividends at a fixed rate. A
subsequent statute increased that rate, and it was argued, as
here, that the designation in the original act created a contract on the part of the State that no additional tax should
be laid, and that the latter act, therefore, impaired the obligation of the contract. But the court held that the designation in the original act was nothing more than a simple
declaration of the tax then to be paid by the bank, and did
not give the slightest intimation of an agreement or understanding, that the tax should not be increased during the
existence of the charter. "To deduce," said the court,
"from premises so insufficient, a consequence of such magnitude, would, indeed, be a gross violation of the wholesome
principle that an abandonment of the power of taxation is
only to be established by clearly showing this to have been
the deliberate purpose of the State."
The position of the appellant, as to the effect of the provision in the same act of Delaware, that the new company
should possess all the rights and privileges vested in the
original companies, or either of them, by that act, or any
other law of that State or the State of Maryland, is more
plausible, but equally unfounded. It proceeds, we think, as
stated by the Circuit Court, upon a misapprehension of the
purpose of the provision. A similar provision, as already
stated, is contained in the Maryland act authorizing, on her
part, the consolidation of the companies. The purpose of
the two provisions was to vest in the new company the rights
and privileges which the original companies had previously
* 10 Pennsylvania State, 451.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

possesed under their separate charters; the rights and privileges in Maryland which the Maryland company had there
enjoyed, and the rights and privileges in Delaware which
the Delaware company had there enjoyed; not to transfer
to either State and enforce therein the legislation of the
other. The new company was clothed by the legislature of
Delaware, so far as that legislature could clothe it, with all
the rights and privileges of both the original companies;
but as the Maryland company took under the legislation of
Maryland only exemption from taxation of its shares in
Maryland, the privilege of the new company in this matter
could only be a similar exemption in that State, not a similar
exemption of the shares of its capital stock from taxation in
Delaware. The new company stood in each State as the
original company had previously stood in that State, invested
with the same rights, and subject to the same liabilities.
And the act of consolidation, so far as Delaware was concerned, had only this effect.
The act of that State under which the three companies
were consolidated into one, and the present defendant corporation was formed, contained a similar provision to the
one we have been considering, that the new consolidated
company should be entitled to all the rights, privileges, and
immunities which each and all of them possessed and enjoyed under their respective charters, a provision which, in
no respect, changed the position with reference to taxation
of the new company in one of the States from that of the
old company in such State. Such is substantially the construction given by this court in the case of the Philadelphia,
Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Company against Maryland, reported in the 10th of Howard.* In that case the
question arose whether the qualified exemption of the line
of road which belonged to one of the companies was extended to the consolidated company under the provision in
question ; and the court said that, "as these companies held
their corporate privileges under different charters, the evi10 Howard, 377. In the title given in 10th Howard the word "[Baltimore" is omitted by mistake.

THE DELAWARE RAILROAD TAX.
Opinion of the court.

dent meaning of this provision is, that whatever privileges
and advantages either of them possessed should in like mantier be held and possessed by the new company, to the extent
of the road they had respectively occupied before the union;
that it should stand in their place, and possess the power,
rights, and-privileges they had severally enjoyed in the portions of the road which had previously belonged to them."
We are, therefore, of opinion that the act of April 8th,
1869, is not obnoxious to the objection that it violates any
contract between the State of Delaware and the company
contained in the charter of the latter.
We proceed, therefore, to the second objection to the act,
-chat it imposes taxes upon property beyond the jurisdiction
of the State. If such be the fact the tax to that extent is invalid, for the power of taxation of every State is necessarily
confined to subjects within its jurisdiction. The objection
of the appellant is directed principally to the tax imposed
by the fourth section of the act, and assumes that the tax
must be considered as laid upon the shares as representing
the separate property of the individual stockholders, or as
representing the property of the corporation. And the argument is that if the tax be laid upon the shares of the
stockholders it falls upon property out of the State, because
nearly all the stockholders, at least a much greater number
than the ratio of the mileage of the road in Delaware to its
entire length, are citizens and residents of other States; and
if the tax be laid upon the shares as representing the property of the corporation, it falls upon property out of the
State, because the ratio of the mileage of the road in Delaware to its entire length is not that which the capital invested by the company in that State bears to the entire
capital of the company, or that which the value of the property of the company there situated bears to the value of its
entire property.
If the assumption of the appellant were correct, there
would be difficulty in sustaining the validity of the tax.
In the first place, the share of a stockholder is, in one
aspect, something different from the capital stock of the com.

pany; the latter only is the property of the corporation ; the
former is the individual interest of the stockholder, constituting his right to a proportional part of the dividerds when
declared, and to a proportional part of the effects of the
corporation when dissolved, after payment of its debts. Regarded in that aspect it is an interest or right which accompanies the person of the owner, having no locality independent of his domicile.* But whether, when thus regarded,
it can be treated as so far severable from the property to
which it relates as to be taxable independent of the locality
of the latter is a question not necessary now to decide. The
argument of the appellant assumes that it is thus severable.
In any aspect, if provision for the taxation of the shares
at the locality of the company be made in its charter, their
taxability at such locality is annexed as an incident to thq
shares, and it does not matter where the domicile of the
owner may be. The tax may then be enforced through the
corporation by requiring it to withhold the amount from
the dividends payable thereon. The shares in the national
banks created under the act of Congress of June 3d, 1864,
are made taxable at the place where the bank is located,
and not elsewhere; and in the case of The National Bank v.
Commonwealth, reported in the 9th of Wallace, a law of Kentucky requiring the banks in that State to pay the tax laid
on their shares was sustained by this court.t But in the
act of Delaware under which the corporation defendant was
formed, there is no such provision for the taxation of the
shares of the individual stockholders.
In the second place, assuming that the tax is upon the
property of the corporation, if the ratio of the value of the
property in Delaware to the value of the whole property of
the company be less than that which the length of the road
in Delaware bears to its entire length, and such is admitted

THE DELAWARE RAILROAD TAX.
Opinion of the court.

to be the fhct, a tax imposed upon the property in Delaware
according to the ratio of the length of its road to the length
of the whole road must necessarily fall upon property out
of the State. The length of the whole road is in round numbers one hundred miles; the length in Delaware is twentyfour miles. The tax upon the property estimated according
to this ratio would be in Delaware 2 4 or 6 of the amount
of the tax upon the whole property. But the value of th
property in Delaware is not 6 of the value of the whole
property, but much less than this proportion would require.
We repeat, therefore, that upon the assumption made by
the appellant there would be difficulty in sustaining the tax.
We do not think, however, the assumption is correct. As
we construe the language of the fourth section, the tax is
neither imposed upon the shares of the individual stockholders nor upon the property of the corporation, but is a
tax upon the corporation itself; measured by a percentage
upon the cash value of a certain proportional part of the
shares of its capital stock; a rule which, though an arbitrary
one, is approximately just, at any rate is one which the legislature of Delaware was at liberty to adopt.
The State may impose taxes upon the corpora tion as an
entity existing under its laws, as well as upon the capital
stock of the corporation or its separate corporate property.
And the manner in which its value shall be assessed and the
rate of taxation, however arbitrary or capricious, are mere
matters of legislative discretion. It is not for us to suggest
in any case that a more equitable mode of assessment or
rate of taxation might be adopted than the one prescribed
by the legislature of the State; our only concern is with the
validity of the tax; all else lies beyond the domain of our
jurisdiction.
Nothing was urged in the argument specially against the
tax upon the corporation under the first section of the act,
which is determined by the net earnings or income of the
company. Whatever objections could be presented are answered by the observations already made upon the tax u der
the other section. A tax upon a corporation may be pro.

portioned to the income received as well as to the value of
the franchise granted or the property possessed.
It remains to notice the objections that the act of 1869
conflicts with the power of Congress to regulate commerce
among the several States, and interferes with the right of
transit of persons and property from one State into or
through another.
The tax imposed by the act in question affects commerce
among the States and impedes the transit of persons and
property from one State to another just in the same way,
and in no other, that taxation of any kind necessarily increases the expenses attendant upon the use or possession
of the thing taxed. That taxation produces this result of
itself constitutes no objection to its constitutionality. As
was very justly observed by this court in a recent case,
"Every tax upon personal property, or upon occupations,
business, or franchises, affects more or less the subjects, and
the operations of commerce. Yet it is not everything that
affects commerce that amounts to a regulation of it, within
the meaning of the Constitution."*
The exercise of the authority which every State possesses
to tax its corporations and all their property, real and personal, and their franchises, and to graduate the tax upon the
corporations according to their business or income, or the
value of their property, when this is not done by discriminating against rights held in other States, and the tax is
not on imports, exports, or tonnage, or transportation to
other States, cannot be regarded as conflicting with any
constitutional power of Congress.
From the views expressed, it follows that the judgment
of the Circuit Court must be
AFFIRMED, AND IT IS SO ORDERED.
