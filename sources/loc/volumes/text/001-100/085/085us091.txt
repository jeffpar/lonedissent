v.

FISTER.

Statement of the case.

The tenth article of the contract requires no discussion.
It is quite immaterial in any view of the case.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

WILLETT V.

FISTER.

The testimony of a wife and daughter, undertaking to swear from mere
memory after a lapse of several years, as to the exact year (as ex. gr.,
whether 1865 or 1866) when they saw a particular paper, discredited;
there being circumstances leading to the inference that they were mistaken as to the year; and the purpose of the suit which their testimony
was brought to sustain being to disturb, in favor of the husband and
father, after a lapse of nearly five years, and after the death of one of
the opposite parties to it, a settlement apparently fair.

from the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia; the case being thus:
John Fister, a butcher, had a stall in market where be sold
pork. He bought his hogs of V. Willett and W. E. Clark,
trading as V. Willett & Co., and there was a pass-book held
by Fister in which the debits and credits were entered of
the transactions between the parties; the originalentries being
made on the commercial books of Willett & Co. On Fister's
pass-book, under date of 21st November, 1865, was the following entry:
" By cash, on 30th of October, $1500."
APPEAL

And on Willett & Co.'s books:
" 1866, October 30th, by cash, for proceeds of stall, $1500."

The account on the pass-book, as well as the account on
Willett & Co.'s books, were all closed on December 14th,
1865, by "a note, at four months from this date, for
$1726.69."
The pass-book and the defendant's commercial books were
all in the handwriting of Willett, who died in 1869.
On the 15th of June, 1866, Fister confessed to V. Willett
& Co. a judgment for $6226, the amount of several notes

which he had given for balances due from him in running
account; and subsequently conveyed several lots of ground,
the proceeds of which on sale of them were to be applied
towards payment of the judgment.
In this state of things, on the 15th of December, 1870,
Willett being now dead, Fister filed a bill in the court below against his executors and Clark, praying that the judgmeit which he had confessed might be set aside; the ground
of the bill being, as was alleged, that he, Fister, was an
ignorant man, scarcely able to write his name, and had been
induced to give the judgment for $6226, not observing that
Willett & Co. had not credited him with a payment of $1500
made some months before the confession of it, for which
payment he, Fister, had then and still had a receipt. The
receipt was without date, and in these words:
"Received of John Fister, fifteen hundred dollars on account,
which is not on his book, owing to his not having it.along to-day.
"V. WILLETT & CO."

It did not appear that any other receipt than this, excepting one for $800, signed by Clark, and dated October 20th,
1863, had ever passed between the parties. The pass-book
and Willett & Co.'s books were apparently the only records.
The answer, both by the defendant Clark and the executors of Willett, gave full details of the transactions between
Fister and V. Willett & Co.; averred that Fister made but
one payment to them of $1500; denied that he had a receipt
for $1500 for which he had not already received credit;
averred that the judgment was properly entered for the
amount due and no more, " and that all the credits to which
the plaintiff was entitled were allowed him; and that he
at that time well understood the same, and was perfectly
.satisfied with the said settlement."
The only question in the case was one of fact: Did the
receipt without date refer to the transaction of 30th October,
1865, or to another amount of $1500 which Fister alleged
had been paid in April, 1865 ?

plainant, was examined; this examination being on the 5th
of February, 1871; and the defendants objecting to her testimony as not competent under the acts of Congress, in virtue of which it was offered.* Mrs. Fister said:
"I attended to the principal part of my husband's business in
market; received and paid out the money for him; I was in
fact the banker of my husband. I got the receipt in April,
1865; I know it was then, because I was cleaning some shad
and wanted some change, and I went up to where my husband's
jacket was hanging on the sideboard, and run one of my hands
down one of his pockets to see if there was any money in it; I
pulled out this paper; I then called in my daughter, Maria, and
she read it. . . .After she read it, I carelessly threw it in the
drawer and didn't think anything more about it for some time .
I looked at it again afterwards, and put it in an old book which
Mr. Willett had laid aside, and did not take it out again until a
year subsequent; I never showed the receipt to my husband;
he never saw it; 1 did not think it was anything of any ac-

count; I merely laid it aside; I did not know exactly what it
was for; I did not call my husband's attention to it when he
went to make the settlement with Willett, for I did not know
of a settlement till he came back; I did not call his attention to
it when he came back; I found it in 1865; Mr. Willett died in
1869; I cannot say for what that receipt was given ; it might
have been given for the $1500, or it might not, that I sent my
husband with; I can only swear as to the time I got the receipt." "I had often sent Mr. Willett a roll of money of $1500
or $2000 at a time; the way he did not have it on the books is
this: this $1500 or $2000 was in payment, perhaps, of two or
three lots of hogs, and 1 got credit on the books for each lot of
hogs separately."
" Question. Did you ever pay him as much as $2000 in one
day ?"
"Answer. I don't know as I paid him $2000, but I know I paid
him $1700 in one day, and I paid large amounts at other times;

I remember that in Januaryor February, 1865, I sent him $1500;
my husband was going down, and having worried me a great
deal about the book, not being able to find it, I said, ' I wish to

heaven you and Mr. Willett would settle your business together
and not trouble me.' I wrapped up one roll of $600 with red
,string, and I took a piece of flannel and tied up another bundle
of' $900 with it; he put the $600 into his side-pocket and the
other bundle of $900 into his pantaloons pocket."
Mrs. Maria Clements, daughter of the complainant, was
also examined. She said:
"One day my mother called me to her and said she had a
receipt there that she could not understand; it had Willett's
name on it; I read it, she holding it; I told her it was a receipt
for $1500, with no day and date; that was in the month of
April, 1865; after I read it, 1 gave it back to her and told her
to take care of it; 1 know it was in April, 1865, because she
asked me to remember, and I did; 1 also mentioned the day,
'but I have now forgotten that."
I Question. What makes you recollect it was April, 1865?"
"Answer. When I said, 'There is no day and date,' she said,
'This is the way your father has been doing business; he takes
a receipt without day or date; now we will remember this;'
that is what makes me recollect it was in April, 1865-my telling her it was in April, 1865; that impressed it on my memory;
it could not have been in 1866."
" Question. Have you had any conversation with her about it
since April, 1865, until to-day?"
"Answer. We have often talked it over, but I could not state
how often; I know nothing further touching the matter in con.
troversy."
Fister's pass-book contained entries thus:

Opinion of the court.

The pass-book showed that, taking the various sums total
of cash paid by Fister, from January to No Vember, 1865,
the addition of $1500 to the amount paid in any one month
would make a much larger sum than was ever paid in any
other month. For example, the cash receipts were:

Clark, one of the defendants, was also examined, and he
testified that in his presence, in the autumn of 1865, Fister
paid Willett $1500, saying that he had not his pass-book
with him; that Willett gave him a receipt; that so far as
the witness knew, Fister had never paid any other sum of
$1500 afterwards; that Fister, in confessing the judgment
to secure the notes which he had given, said "that he
thought he had done right, as he owed the debt and could
not pay the money and wanted to secure it," and that he had
never made to the witness any complaint that the judgment
had been confessed for too much.
The court below sustained the claim of the complainant
to the two credits and the defendants appealed.

years and a half after the alleged mistake. During that long,
period the complainant made no pretence that he had not
received all the credits to which le was entitled. Constantly assenting by his silence to the correctness of the settlement, and of the judgment he had confessed, he conveyed,
several lots of ground to the defendants and others, that the
proceeds of the sales thereof might be applied in payment,
and it was not until after the death of the person who received the money which he now claims was not credited.
that this suit was brought. Certainly after such delay, andi
after such long apparent acquiescence in the correctness of
the settlement, the evidence ought to be very clear that a
mistake was in fact made, in order to justify unravelling
what was done.
The settlement included several notes which the complainant had given for balances due from him, according to,
a running account. This account had been kept in the.
books of Willett & Co., and also in a pass-book held by him..
It is not contended that the judgment was not taken for the
sums for which the notes had been given, or that the notes
were for a larger aggregate than appeared to be due by the
accounts kept, both in the complainant's pass-book and in
the books of the defendants. The contention is that a payment was made by the complainant, which did not appear
on any of the books, and which was not credited to him.
The evidence of this is an undated receipt for $1500. But
the books of the defendants show a credit given for that
sum on the 80th of October, 1865, and in the pass-book
there is an entry of credit for the same sum, under date of
November 21st, 1865, as having been received October 30th.
As the receipt itself is the only receipt which appears ever
to have been given, except one for $800, dated October 20th,
1863, signed W. E. Clark, and as it states that the complainant had not his pass-book along when the payment was made,
it would seem to be a reasonable presumption that it refers
to the payment made on the 30th of October, and which was,
afterwards, on the 21st of November, credited in the passbcok. If so, there was plainly no mistake in the notes and

none in the judgment. Then certainly the complainant received every credit which was his due.
But Mrs. Fister testifies that she saw the receipt in April,
1865, before the payment of October 30th was made. If she
is correct in that, then the payment made in October was a
difibrent payment from that acknowledged in the receipt.
But we are satisfied that her memory in regard to the time
when she first saw the paper is at fault. There is nothing
in regard to which a witness is more likely to be mistaken,
than in fixing the date at which a transaction long past took
place. She was examined as a witness in 1871, nearly six
years after the time when she says she found the receipt in
her husband's pocket. When she found it, according to her
own account, she did not think it of any importance. She
" carelessly threw it in a drawer, and did not think any more
about it for some time." Then she put it in an old book
and laid it aside, and did not take it out for a year. She did
not call her husband's attention to it before he settled with
the defendants. She "was not aware she had it." She
"1never showed it to her husband," though she knew when
he went to make the settlement. She did not think it was
of any account, and there was no circumstance associated
with her finding it that could have tended to impress the
time upon her memory. She says she knows it was in
April, 1865, because she was cleaning shad and wanted
change; but she may as well have been cleaning shad in
1866 as in 1865. The same remarks are applicable to the
testimony of Maria Clemenits, the daughter. She says she
remembers it was in April, 1865, because her mother told
her to remember, saying, " This is the way your father has:
been doing business. He takes a receipt without day or,
date. Now, we will remember this." Rather inconsistent
this is with the testimony of the mother, who declares that
she thought the paper of no importance. It may be these
witnesses have persuaded themselves they saw the receipt in
April, 1865. They have often talked the matter over with
each other. But there are many improbabilities in their
statements. Mrs. Fister says she was in fact her husband's

banker. She chiefly made the payments. She even goes
so far as to say that she sent to the defendants, in January
or February, 1865, $1500. Not, indeed, in one sum. Her
language is: "I wrapped up one roll of $600 with red string,
and I took a piece of flannel and tied up another bundle of
$900 with it. He (her husband) put the $600 into his side
pocket, and the other bundle of $900 into his pantaloons
pocket." Such a minute recollection of a six-year-old transaction is almost too remarkable to be credited. But it is
still more remarkable that neither the husband nor the wife
discovered that they had no credit for so large a payment.
The accounts show that on the 28th of February, 1865, on
the transactions running through the months of January
and February there was a balance of $2120.19, for $2000 of
which he then gave his notes. If he had made the payment
which he now asserts, the balance would have been only
$620.19. It is incredible that he would have given notes
fir $2000 under such circumstances, for the payment must
then have been fresh in his recollection. In addition to this
we have the habit of business between the parties during
the years 1864 and 1865, exhibited at large in the defendants'
books and in the complainant's pass-book. If $1500 were
paid in any month in addition to the sums credited, it would
have been entirely outside of the usual course of business.
It must have made an impression upon the complainant's
memory when he gave the notes and confessed the judgment.
Looking, therefore, at the probabilities of the case as deduced from the evidence, at the long delay of the complainant to assert any claim, and at the fact that Mr. Willett had
died before the bill was filed, we think there is no sufficient
proof of a mistake to warrant a decree sustaining to any extent the complainant's bill.
