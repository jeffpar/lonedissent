the District Court of the United. States, sitting in bahkruptcy, had power to decree

a sale bfthe mortgaged property of a bankrupt; and if there are more mortgages
than .one, and the proceeds of sale are insufficient to discharge the eldest mortgage, the purchaser will hold the property free and clear of all encumbrances
arising from the junior mortgage.

T is case was brought up, by a writ of error issued under
the twenty7-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, from the Supreme

The facts in the case are fully set forth in the opinion of the

It was argued by -Mr..ohnson and Mr. Clay,.for the plainties in error, and 141r. Sergeant, for the def6ndants in error.
Mr. Johnson stated the case on behalf of the plaintiffs in
error, who were purchasers of certain property which was exposed to public sale by order of the District Court of the United
States. The question was, whether a mortgage upon the property, held by the City Bank, was an existing lien at the time
of filing the bill, or whether the lien had been destroyed by
the proceedings in bankruptcy.

He then proceeded to lay down four propositions :
1. That the District Court had jurisdiction to decree a sale,
with or without the assent of the mortgagee, and the purchaser
gets an absolute title hgainst all persons claiminig by or through
the bankrupt.
2. If wrong in this proposition, and the District Court had
no authority to sell without the assent of the mortgagee, then
it had' power to sell- with that assent; and as the property did
not sell for enough to pay the first mortgagee, who assented to
the sale, the title to the purchaser becomes absolute.
3. If wrong in this, then that the conduct of the City Bank,
the junior mortgagee, furnishes presumptive evidence of its assent also to the sale.
.. That the cancellation of the mortgage of the bank under
a mandamus, as between the mortgagee and those claiming
under him, vested an absolute title in the purchaser.
(As the decision of the court turned entirely upon the first
point, the argument of Mr. Johnion, and also those of the
other counsel, upon the other points, are omitted.)
, I. The District Court had power to decree a sale, with
or without the assent of the mortgagee.. This involves two
branches: 1st. Had Congress the constitutional power to pass such an
act ?
2d. Did they, by the act, vest the power. in the District
Court ?
lst'. The power -of Congress was deftied during the passage
of the act, but this court have afirmed it by decreeing under
it. It is only necessary to refer to the language Qf the Constitution, and it will be seen that the .terms of the- grant are of
the broadest character. The power is to pass all laws; the
only restriction is that they shall be uniform. Bat as the court
has already decided the constitutionality of the law, by acting
under it, the inquiry need not be pursued.
2d. Did Congress,.by the act, vest the power in question in
the District Court ?
We have seen, 'that the power of Congress over the subject
of bankruptcy is total and absolute, with the single limita-.
tion, that the laws must be uniform; and an exainmation
of the law will show that Congress intended to exercise the
whole of its power. "This is'a cardinal principle in the interpretatiori of the statute. â€¢ If the'legislative power -wasvintended
to be exhausted, we can judge how much was given to the
courts. We say, that jurisdiction over the whole subject of
bankruptcy was conferred.
The title of the act is coextensive with the Power of Con-

gress. -It is "to -establish a uniform system," &.
The first
section is so, too., The second avoids certain.deeds, &c., and
the proviso.says .that liens or mortgages, &c., shall not be impaired. The only effect of this is to preserve the rights themselves; but it gives no direction how the rights. are to be enforced. .It means that the courts of the United Staies are to
protect them, as well as the"State courts; and the uniform rule
by which this is to be done can only be found in the former,
acting .as they do from 6ne common source of construction and
authority, namely, this -court. The exception itself in favor
of these rights shows that Congress intended to occupy the
whole ground. . Every thing which is,not excepted passes under the act. The rights themselves, therefore, being the only
*matters which axe excepted, the mode of enforcing those rights
by an application to the State coufts is not saved. Not being
excepted, it is gone. If Congress had intended that the' State
courts should retain their jurisdiction over mortgages, and have
the power of foreclosing them, the law would have said so.
The argument upon the other side must be, that all these encumbranceswere excluded from the operation of the law entirely. But the bankrupt is obliged'to make a return of all his
property of every kind, under the penalty of losing the benefit
of the law. He must include, his mortgaged property, and the
whole must be adjudicated by one head. Other sections, in
additioi to the proviso, show a design of giving the control of
the whole subject to the District Court. All property of the
bankrupt, all his rights in every species of estate, real, personal; and mixed, all 'his debts, are portions of .the matter which
is thrown into this court. Debts are provable and proved there'.
If such a surrender be not made, the bankrupt is n6t to have
the benefit of the act. This shows 'that all the debts are to
be paid out of the property. The fifth,'.seventh, ninth, tenth,
and fifteenth sections all tend to show the control of the 'District Court over the entire subject; the sixth and eighth, more
especially. * Let us revert to the question before the court, and
see what it is. Had the District Court .authority to decree a
sale. of, mortgaged pr0 rty, so as to give the purchaser a good
title ? This is the question. The language of the Constitu'tion is very. different as to the two subjects of naturalization
and bankruptcy. Over the first the power of Congress is only
to establish a uniform.rule, leaving it to the State, as well as
federal, courts .to enforce the rule. The jurisdiction of State
courts is not taken away. Put over the subject of bankruptcy
the. power is to establish uniform laws. They must be the
same everywhere. It would be strange, if the United States
'courts were not vested with power to decide all- questions

-

which may occur under these laws. The object was uniformity. In fact, this was the condition upon which the power was
held by the federal government. The act of Congress says
that the District Court shall have jurisdiction over all matters arising under the act, all "cases and controversies," all
"acts, matters, and things," &c., until a final distribution. Is
this a power merely to sell an estate subject to liens? If-a
clear title could not be obtained, the property would be sacri-.
ficed. The fact that claims may exist upon the property, and
the legality of those claims, are wholly different things. A
bankrupt may make fraudulent mortgages, or give illegal claims
to his wife. Who is to decide -the question of their legality,
unless it be the District Court? Until the question was settled, the property would'not sell. So much for the sixth section. But the eighth removes all doubt, for it allows -the Circuit Court to entertain a bill in equity in all cases arising. under
laws, treaties, &c. The third section. vests the rights of a
bankrupt in the assignee. Could he not have -filed a bill in
the Circuit Court to have the mortgaged property sold ? The
mortgagee also might file a bill. If the assignee were to assert,
and prove, that the mortgage was void, either in his bill or answer, would not the court set it aside ? 'But the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court is concurrent with -the District Court, not
superior to it. The District Court has, therefore, the -same
power.
The decisions of this court in 3 Howard, 203 and 426, settle the question. But the opinion is said to be obiter. It is
strange, that the highest court in the.land, vested with power
to decide constitutional questions, should listen for. many hours
to arguments, write out its opinion,' nd that such opinion
should be disregarded as obiter. It was wise to settle the law
then. As sdon as the act of 1841 passed, numerous cases occurrec under it. Doubts grew up. Judges decided differently.
Property to the amount of thousands of dollars was distributed
under the law. It was the duty of this court, as guardians of
the commonwealth, to settle all these difficulties; and guard
against conflicti between the authorities of the States and
United States. But the doctrines assefted in Ex parte Christy,
3 -Howard, 203, have ceased to be obiter. Even if we admit
that the precise point now before us was not before the court
in that case, yet it came up afterwards, in 3 Howard, 426. At
page- 434, the court say, that they concur in the principles
and reasoning of Ex parte Christy. The dismission of the bill
depended upon the case coming within the preceding case of
Ex parte Christy, and the decision was made upon this ground.
This was not, therefore, an obiter opinion. At page 440, Mr.

SUPREME COURT.
Houston et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

Justice Catron never doubted the power of the District Court
over mortgaged property, provided the jurisdiction of a State
court had not first attached. As this did not occur in the pres.
ent case, it appears to be free from all objection.
Mr. Sergeant, for defendants in error.
This case is brought to this court under the twenty-fifth
section of the Judiciary Act, and the only point open is the
one which arises under that section. It has been said by the
counsel on the other side, that the whole case is before this
court, and the authority of Osborne v. Bank of United States
cited in 'support of the position. * But that case was not
brought here under the twenty-fifth section. This court cannot decide that the court below was right on the constitutional
point, and then proceed to reverse the decision for other reasons. Only one of. the points stated by the opposite counsel is
before the court now. The other three are not. All questions
relating to the respective rights of different mortgagees is a
Louisiana question, to be decided by the State courts. Whether or not the.bank assented to the sale is not a point which this
court is at liberty to examine under the record, nor whether the
proceedings in the State courts, in order to obtain the cancellation of the mortgages, were regular or not. These are questions for the courts of the State exclusively. The only question
now before us is the right of the District Court, under the act
of Congress, to force to a conclusion all matters between a.
mortgagor and mortgagee. How has the exercise of this power worked in the present case ? The bankrupt was worth
$ 350,000, and borrowed $ 200,000 on mortgage. The property, under the forced sale, sold for $120,000 only, not one
third of what the assignee had valued it at. (Mr. Sergeant
here recited the facts in the case.)
The question before us may be divided into two branch-

es

-

1st. Had the District Court jurisdiction over mortgages?
2d. Had it jurisdiction in this, case, and in the mode pursued ?
1st. Before the case bf Ex parte Christy, different constructions had been given -to the act of Congress, and we, are still
in the midst of the conflict. Where was the necessity of deciding in advance? The act of Congress could as well be carried out in one way as in the other. If the settlement of questions relating to mortgages had been left to State courts, it.
would not have protracted the settlement of a bankrupt's estate. The necessity pf the case does not demand that -this
power should be vested in the 'District Courts. The existence

JANUAR-U

Housten et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

of different opinions shows a doubt -of the existence of such a
power; and a decision in favor of this ultra power will make
a law odious which was not so before. It makes the law interfere with State jurisdiction. If this mortgage had been left
to the ordinary course of proceeding in Louisiana, the case
would have been settled long ago. But instead of that, we are
here now, disputing about an act of Congress. What is it?
The proviso in the;second section controls and limits the whole
act. It declares that nothing shall annul, destroy, or impair
the rights of married women, or liens or mortgages. Without
this proviso, the law could not have been passed. It was put
in because the States required it to be so. The reservation is,
that liens shall not be impaired. Suppose a lien existed upon
property, and the person who held the lien was put into possession, and an order of the District Court forces him to sell it
when he does not wish to. do so. Is not his lien impaired?'
The creditor is in possession of property, under a contract that
he shall keep it until the debtor pays him what is due, and the
court sends an officer to take it away. Has he not a less right
than the contract gives him? , So; also, thp construction" contended for onthe other side requires the District Court to settle
the rights ef married women. What right has this court to meddle with the subject, whilst a woman is yet under coverture ?
Who is .to represent her? The proviso saves equally rights
under contracts and rights under the law. Your aid is not
asked to protect them. All liens are preserved which are valid
by the laws of the respective States. Who is to judge of their
validity? The State courts, or the judges of this court in
their circuits ? Whichever tribunal decides, it must look only
to State laws. Where, then, is the evil of allowing State
courts to interpret State laws?
It is not correct to say, as.the opposite counsel has done, that
where Congress has plenary power and passes an act, therefore
the act must be construed to the full extent of the power which
Congress possessed. This has not been the doctrine of Congress nor of the people. Half a century ago, this court' decided that .they would take jurisdiction only so far as Congress
had delegated it. The Judiciary Act of 1789 limits the power
of this court, which has never gone beyond it.- Doubtful
words must not be construed to enlarge jurisdiction until -the
people alter the Constitution of the United States. If there
be a doubt, the test must then be applied, whether a necessary
implication exists, or whether the laws of the United Stats
can be enforced without the jurisdiction claimed. This is the
rule in all cases of limited jurisdiction. Apply it to this case.
Has Congress said clearly that this power is given to the Dis-

492

SUPREME COURT.
Houston et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans,

trict Court? On. the contrary, some of the judges of this court
have denied the power, which shows that it is not clearly
granted.
The second, third, and eleventh sections all have the same
object in view, namely, the preservation of rights which exist
under State laws; and the only inquiry is into the validity of
these rights under those laws. The United States are jealous
of their Constitution, and have courts of their own to protect
it. Is it unreasonable to concede the same feeling to the
States, and to allow their own courts to decide upon rights
flowing from State lav'rs? Nobody doubts the correctness of
the course pursued by the United States. Why not grant the
same to the States?.
The third section gives to the assignee -all the rights of the
bankrupt. Take the case of property pledged for a debt due
by a bankrupt, and in possession of the mortgagee. The bankrupt himself has no right to take it out of his possession, except by redeeming it. How, then, can the assignee do it, and
exercise greater power than the bankrupt himself? All that
the assignee can legally do is to redeem. Bat the claim here
is, that the assignee can bring the unwilling creditor into the
District Court, and compel him to sell the property. If there
is a loss, on whom will it fall? The creditor must be the only
sufferer. So it would be, if family rights were involved. The
assignee would look only to the interest of the creditors of
the bankrupt, and the rights of the family be wholly disregarded.
2d. -Had the District Court jurisdiction in this*case, and in
the mode pursued?
(Mr. Sergeant here objected, that the requisitions of the act
had not been complied with, as to the petition, notice, &c.)
In England, the courts order trustees to invest trust-funds-in
mortgages, and so they do in the United States. Such an investment is generally recognized as a safe place for -money.
What- is a mortgage ? .It is an estate in land vested in the
mortgagee. It may be called' a security for a debt, but it is
created by a conveyance of the estate. It is true that it is an
estate on condition subsequent, but if the debt is not paid, the
estate vests iri the mortgagee.. The relief sought here is to
have the property sold. I ask that the contract may be carried
out. The nature of a mortgage is explained in 1 Howard, 318,
and 9 Wheaton, 489. It is there asserted, that the mortgagor
has no right,'at law or equity, but to redeem the property by
paying the debt. Whilst the mortgagee has two remedies,
namely, by ejec.tment and bill, -the
mortgagor has no riit
except to redeem. Congress knew this, and vested his right

in the assignee. In Pennsylvania there is no foreclosure of a
'mortgage. The courts of law furnish the remedy. Our mortgagee can 'never be obliged to sell. Will you overturn our law.
of mortgage by ambiguous words? I adhere to the contract
in this case. . They go 'out of it. It is at the option of the
mortgagee whether to sell or not; but they compel him to sell.
The property was worth $ 350,000. Suppose they had waited
for a favorable time to sell, instead -of putting it up at auction.
What good has accrued to any one from so putting it up?
None. But the opposite counsel say that this course is iecommended by its simplicity. What has this simplicity produced?
A long contest in Louisiana, and now here, at a grievous expense. Congress never intended this. Nor did they intend to
place the courts of the United States in a position antagonistical
to the State courts, and thereby compel the latter to surrender the whole control of the subject. And.foi what purpose?
To promote speedy settlements?' The cases under the bankrupt law of 1800 are not yet all disposed of. Now' and then
we find one walking the earth; like an unquiet ghost.
Mr. Clay, for the plaintiffs in error, in reply and conclusion.
Thomas Banks, a citizen of New Orleans, being the owner
of a block of buildings in that city, a remarkable edifice, called
Banks's Arcade, executed three several mortgages upon it, the
first to the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company, the
second. to the Carrollton Railroad Company, and the third,
and last in point of time, to the City Bank of New Orleans, the
defendant hi this writ of error. These mortgages were excuted to secure payment of large sums of money which Banks
owed to the respective mortgagees, as stated in the mortgages.
On the 30th of July, 1842, Banks filed his petition, in the Distrirt Court of the United States, holden in New. Orleans, to be
declared a bankrupt, under the'act of the Congress of the United States to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy. His
petition was accompanied by a schedule, exhibiting the names
of all his' creditors, and: a list of all his property; and among
his creditors' so enumerated is the defendant, for a loan on
mortgage and on pledge of stock; and among the property described in the schedule, and surrendered to his creditors, is
Banks's Arcade. On the 5th of September, 1842, after due publication and notice served on the creditors resident in the city
of New Orleans, (the- defendant being one of them,) according
to the requ'isition of the bankrupt act, a decree of bankruptcy
was pronounced by the District Court, and F..B. Conrad was
appointed assignee of the bankrupt's estate, who qualified, and
efitered on the duties of his office according to law.
VOL. VI.

494

SUPREME COURT.
Houst'on et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

On the 10th of October, 1842, the assignee presented a-petition to the District Court, stating that a great portion of the
bankrupt's property consisted of large masses, such as the City
Hotel, Banks's Arcade, &c., which would sell to greater advantage if subdivided; that the leases granted by the bankrupt
were about expiring; and that the interest of the estate would
be promoted by leasing out the property for one year, as purchasers would prefer buying with tenants in occupation of the
property. A day was fixed, by order of the court, for the hearing of the petition, which was advertised in the newspapers;
and on the hearing, the prayer of the petition was granted, and
the assignee took possession of Banks's Arcade and the other
property of the bankrupt.
Subsequently, the assignee applied to the District Court for
an order of sale of the property, exbibited plans for its subdivision, and proposed terms of sale. The court fixed a day for
the hearing of the petition,*ordered it to be published in' the
newspapers, and personal notice of it to be served on the mortgagees. On the 6th of January, 1843, the court, after zeciting
that notices had been published according to the rules of court,
and that personal notice had been served on the mortgage creditcrs, naming them, (and the defendant among them,) pronounced a judgment, that the sale of the property take place in
the manner and on the terms proposed by the assignee, on the
15th of February, 1843; and that the mortgages be cancelled,
so as to give purchasers unencumbered titles, reserving,' however, to the mortgagees respectively, their rights upon the proceeds of sale.
The sale accordingly was effected, by the marshal of the
United States, on the day.appointed, when the plaintiffs, being
the highest bidders, became respectively the purchasers of the
several parcels adjudged to them by that officer. The sale
was one of the most notorious and attractive that ever took
place in the city of New Orleans, from the conspicuous position, great value, and well-known character of Banks's Arcade,
&c. It was duly advertised -in the newspapers of the city,
placarded, and otherwise made public, and brought together a
vast multitude. It was conducted with irreproachable fairness,
which is not contested at all in the'present suit. By the subdivision *of the great block of buildings into smaller parcels,
they were placed within the reach of a greater nhmber of persons, and consequently excited more competition among persons disposed to purchase. By the large and liberal credits
given to purchasers, (which there was no obligation to have
done,) the property was also placed in the power of more capitalists and purchasers. Fron these'two causes, it is beyond a-

Houston et a]. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

doubt, 'that the property sold for much more than it wolfld
have commanded- if it had been put up in block and sold for
cash.
From the public advertisement and the great notoriety of
this sale of Banks's Arcade, in the absence of all proof it wouldnbt have been doubted, but it is positively proven in the cause,
that the defendant had:'full notice of the sale. Yet neither
the ilefendant, nor any one of that vast multitude present at the
sale, interposed, in any manner whatever, to forbid it, or uttered one word of warning or advice to persons.bidding, to preyent their purchasing. And the plaintiffs, so far from supposing
that they would be. -involved in a tedious and-expensive lawsuit about the property they vere purchasing, had every reason
to conclude that they would acquire a clear, unencumbered, and
indisputable title to it.
Still, before they actually paid the consideration money, and'
received titles for the 'property purchased, they requiped of the
assignee the production of the. certificate of the register of.
mortgages, that there existed no' mortgage or other encumbrance on the. property, which certificate -is held by the law
and practice of Louisiana to be a perfect security to purchasers
against preexisting liens. The District Court, it has. been
seen, had ordered the mortgages (including the defendant's)
to be cancelled, prior to the sale, so that purchasers might
obtain unencumbered titles; and what the law, through the
tr'bunals 'of justice, commands to be done, ought' to be considered and taken as done. But to remove all scruples and
quiet al apprehensions, on the 24th of February, 1843, the
court passed an order, at the instance of the assignee, stating
that, in pursuance of 'its order, a sale had taken place, for
which sale the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company,
which held the first and oldest mortgage -on Banks's Arcade.
had given, to the assignee its written consent that its mortgage
should be raised, in order .that the assignee might pass clear
titles' to the purchasers; and ordering that the recorder of'
mortgages should erase from his records the mortgages -of the
defendant and others.
On the 6th of March, 1843, the assignee presented his petition to the Parish Court for the parish of New Orleans, reciting
the pioce'ecdings in the District Court, and the refusal of the
recorder of mortgages to comply with the order to erase the
mortgages; and concluding by praying the court for a. mandamus to compel.the register to cancel the mortgages in con-.
formity with. the order of the District Court. The case was
elaborately argued for threefdys, ii the Parish Court, which
finally ordered the mandamus to be' granted. The recorder

496

SUPREME COURT.
Houston et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

appealed from this decision to the Supreme Court of Louisiana; and that court affirmed it. (See 5 Robinson's Reports
of cases in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, 49.) Thereupon
the recorder erased the mortgages, gave a certificate that no
encumbrances existed on the property, and the assignee passed
a clear title to the plaintiffs, and received the price from them
at which the property had been stricken off, in money and
notes, according to the terms of sale.
On the 23d of June, 1843, the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company presented a petitionto the District Court, stating,
the sale of Banks's Arcade, and praying that, as the first mortgagee, the assignee be ordered to pay over to the petitioner
the cash proceeds and the notes of the purchasers. The court
ordered public notice to be given of this petition, which having been accordingly given, on the, 6th of July, 1843, the day
fixed for its being heard, the court gave judgment that the
assignee pay over to the Canal Bank, holding the oldest mortgage, the proceeds of the sale of Banks's-Arcade. The aggregate amount fell far, short of what was due to the bank.
On the 5th of January, 1844, the assignee having filed his account of his administration. of the bankrupt's estate, so far as he
had been able to make progress in it, his account was referred
by the court to commissioners, for examination and report. The
commissioners proceeded to the adjustment of the assignee's
accounts, awarded or adjudged the proceeds of the sale of
Banks's Arcade to the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company, as the first mortgage creditor on the property, and reported to the court.
Upon receiving their report, the hearing on it was fixed for
the 18th of April, 1844, and notice was ordered to be given
through the public papers, and personally, to the resident creditors of the bankrupt, to show cause why the report should not
be homologated by the court. Among the creditors personally
notifie& was the City Bank of New-Orleans, the prbsent defendant. On the day fixed, the report of the commissioners
was homologated by the court.
Throughout the whole proceedings of the District Court, in
the case of Thomas Banks's bankruptcy, that court appears to
have acted with the greatest caution, and with the most conscientious regard to the rights of mortgagees and'all creditors.
In the -commencement of Banks's action or suit against his
creditors, to obtain his discharge, under the bankrupt act of
Congress, they were notified by publication in the newspapers,
and personally, as required by the act. On the occasion of
every important step taken during the progress of the case, the
creditors were fully notified, either personally or by publica-

tion in the newspapers, or in both forms, of what was proposed
to be done. Thus,, when the. assignee proposed to have the
property subdivided, and, as the l6ases upon it were about expiring, asked for authority to grant new leases, the court fixed
a time for hearing his motion, and ordered public notice thereof to be given in the newspapers. So, when the assignee
applied for an order of sale, accompanying his petition.with a
schedule of the property to be sold, and stating the prioposed
terms of sale, the court fixed a time for hearing the motion,
and ordered that public notice thereof be given in the newspapers, and personally served on the mortgage creditors. So,
also, when the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company, after
the sale of Banks's Arcade, petitioned the court, as the oldest
mortgagee, to have the proceeds of the sale applied towards
payment of its mortgage, a day was fixed for the trial of this
petition, and the court ordered public notice to be given iithe
newspapers. And again, after the report was made of the
commissioners appointed to settle the assignee's account of the
administration of the bankrupt's estate, by which report the
proceeds of Banks's Arcade were awarded to the first mortgagee, as they had been previously by the judgment of the court,
notice was given to. all creditors, through the public papers,
and served personally-on the defendant, to appear and show.
cabse why the report should not be homologated by the court.
But if the District Court were signally assiduous and untiring in inviting, by repeated noti.fications, all persons, and the
City Bank especially, to come forward. and assert their rights,
and oppose whatever might unjustly tend to their prejudice,
that corporation appears to- have firmly resolved to disregard
all its friendly summonses. It maintained throughout an obstinate, if not sullen, silence. It determined upon a deliberate,
if not masterly, inactivity. It never once, on any occasion,
appeared in the District Coulrt sitting in the bankruptcy of
Thomas Banks. It did: not object to, or contest, the sale of
the Arcade, when about to be ordered. It didt not forbid the
sale, when about to be made. -It did not oppose the appropriation of the proceeds, of sale towards the payment of the first
and prior mortgage. When the report of the commissioners,
appointed to settle the accounts of the assignee, was about to
be homologated by the court, the defendant did not oppose the
slightest obstacle, although that report expressly assigned the
proceeds of the Arcade away from his mortgage towards the
satisfaction of the elder mortgage. He -made no opposition,
which is known, to the erasure of his mortgage, either before
the Parish Court of New Orleans, or before the Supreme -Court
of Louisiana. -Ifthe defendant entertained any antipathy to

the federal tribunal, the State courts remained open to him;
but neither there did he makd his appearance, whilst any of
the transactions which he now seeks to annul and set aside
were in progress. He did not before any State court institute
an hypbthecary action, or apply for any order of seizure and
sale to subject the Arcade to the payment of his mortgage.
He applied for no injunction to restrain the proceedings'before
the District Court, nor to prevent the Parish Court from erasing his mhortgage. The defendant was as silent as the grave
until after the whole proceedings about the Arcade were
closed in the bankrupt court, until after the plaintiffs had
bought the property, without warning, paid the purchasemoney, received a clear title, and taken a peaceable and quiet,
and, as they had every right to sippose, an undisturbable Possession, of what they had fairly bought and honestly paid for.
In this stage of the business, when all seemed perfectly
settled" and when, according to the ordinary course of human
affairs, and the wants of quiet and repose in society, there
should be a termination of all controversy, the City Bank of
New Orleans for the hrst time puts itself in motion, and, seeking to disregard, disturb, and set aside: all that had been previously done in respect to the Arcade, commences in th~e Commercial Court of New Orleans its hypothecary action against
the plaintiffs in this writ'of error, as third parties in possession
of the mortgaged property. It does not make defendants to
the suit, either the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company,
or the Carrollton Railroad Company, both of which, as has
been before stated, held mortgages prior in time and dignity to
that of the City Bank of New Orleans. It charges no irregularity, imputes no fraud, and does not impeach the fairness of
the sale. It is founded exclusively upon the notion, that the
highest' judicial tribunals of the State and Union had perse-Yveringly and deliberately misinterpreted the bankrupt act; and
*that, although that -act is now dead, and years have elapsed
and millions of property have changed hands -under faith of
the interpretation given to it, it is not now too late to go back
and'correct the error into which those tribunals -have fallen.
The court dismissed the action of the City Bank, and it appealed to the Supreme Court of Louisiana. That court, reversing the decision of the inferior tribunal, gave judgment for the
City Bank, to reverse which this writ of error is now prosecuted:
I. The first ground on vhich the plaintiffs rely is, that the
first mortgagee, being an acknowledged- party to the cause,
gave his previous consent and authority to the sale, and, after
it was made, petitioned the court to receive the proceeds, and

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

499

Houston et .a.l v. City Bank of Ne.w Orleans.

actually did receive them, towards the satisfaction of his mortgage, and so ratified and confirmed the previous- sale.
(As the decision 6f the court did not turn upon this point,
the argument is omitted.)
II. But it is contended that, without any assent of the first
mortgagee to.the proceedings of the court in bankruptcy, and
even in opposition to the protest of that and every other
encumbrancer, that court, under the act of Congress, had full
and complete jurisdiction over the mortgaged property, had
ample power to order its sale,'and that the sale, in virtue of
its authority, is valid, and binding. upon all parties whatever.
Nothing, it would seem, on principle, would be more proper
and fitting, than that the assignee of the bankrupt should be
invested with all the property, however encumbered, rights,
and interests of the bankrupt : that he should have power to
sell and dispose of it to the best advantage, making cleat titles
to the purchasers; and that he should be obliged, at the same
time, to show proper regard and pay due respect to all liens
and encumbrances existing on the property. In no other way
can a unity in the administration of the bankrupt's estate be
secured. In no other way can a speedy and definitive settlement of it be effected. If a part of his estate, the unencumbered part only, be subject to the authority of the assignee,
and the residue of it, the encumbere4 part, be beyond his contrel, and liable to a different and conflicting administration,
delay and confusion are inevitable.
-What was so manifest and reasonable in itself was not
likely to be overlooked by the wisdom of Congress. Accordingly, in' the bankrupt act, the assignee is invested with the
fullest right and power over the whole estate, rights, and interests of the bankrupt, of whatever kind or nature, to the same
extent in which the bankrupt himself held them." (Third section of the act.). And Congress, looking to .the interest of all
parties to have a speedy settlement of the bankrupt's estate,
has provided, (in the tenth section 'of the actj) that it shall, if
practicable, be accomplished within two years after the decree
in bankruptcy.
By the second section of the act, it is provided, that nothing
in the act contained shall be construed to annul, destroy, *or
impair any lawful'rights of married women or minors, or Any
liens, mortgages, or other securities on property, real or personal, which may be valid by the laws of the States respectively, and which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the
second and fifth sections of the act.
Under this proviso -the defendant contends, that, as mortgagee, he is exempted :from the operation of the bankrupt

500

Ho'uston et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

act; that it does not touch or affect hiim; that the property
which is mortgaged to him is beyond the reach or control of
the-bankrupt court, and that- he-muy proceed 'when he pleases
to enforce his mortgage rights, without regard to the interests
of the other creditors of the bankrupt, and without respect to
the requirement of the bankrupt act to insure a speedy settlement and close of the proceedings in each case in bankruptcy,
within two years, if practicable, after the decree declaring the
bankruptcy.
These are high pretensions, and ought to be fully and justly
weighed. Undoubtedly, the rights of all mortgagees, in a due
execution of the bankrupt act, are to be fully respected and
enforced, and are not to be annulled, destroyed, or impaired.
But, whilst the most liberal and full effect ought to be given
to the part of the act which d6eclares that they shall not be impaired, annulled, or destroyed, full operation should also be allowed to all other parts of the act.
If the act can receive a construction by which the mortgage
creditor can be made safe-in the receipt.of the debt which the
mortgage was intended to secure, and other creditors can be
allowed to* receive what remains of the mortgaged property,
after that object'is accomplished, that construction would be
recommended.by justice and equity.
The plaintiffs, contend, that the mortgaged property should
be fairly administered by the assignde, along with the other
property of the' bankrupt ; that- it should be fairly sold, in a
manner likely to make it the most productive; and that out of
the proceeds the mortgages should be, first satisfied, and the
residue, if any, be applied to the payment of the general creditors. And this, they contend, is necessary to comply with the
provisions of the bankrupt act. Far from annulling, destroying, or impairing the lien, they contend that this course -gives
to it full and complete effect, securing the identical object for.
which the mortgage or lien was created.
But the defendant, in effect, contends that the whole property of the bankrupt, as was manifestly intended by the bankrupt act, is not vested in the assignee ; that a part of that property, which happens to be mortgaged, is without the power or
'control of his assignee; that it can only be acted upon and disposed of when the mortgagee pleases; and, consequently, whatever may be its value or amount, whether it exceeds or not the'
debt which it was intended to secure, it must remain exempt
from the power or management of the assignee.
This is not believed to be according to the design of the
bankrupt act. That was to subject the whole property of the
bankrupt to the payment of all his debts, according to their

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

501

Houston et al. v. City Bank of New Orleans.

priority and privileges. And this design can be best effectuated bkr subjecting the property to a single alid undivided management, under the superintendence of the assignee, acting in
obedience to one judicial tribunal.
If the contrary be supposed,- if the mere fact of the existence of a mortgage withdraws the mortgaged property from
the control of an assignee, -what might be the consequence ?
The mortgage may be illegal and invalid, or.may be upon property amounting to a value greatly exceeding the debt intended
to be secured by it. Is the property mortgaged under "such
circumstances to remaiii beyond the .reach of the*assignee?
Does not every view which can be taken of the subject lead
t'othe conclusion, that the entire property of a bankrupt, encumbered and unencumbered, should be under the control of
the assignee, so as tq be administered by him, with due respect
to.liens or not, as they may happen to exist?
It is further urged by the defendant, that, whilst his. mortgage is to remain sacred and beyond the reach of the assignee,
the equity of-redemption may be sold;. in other words, that the
mortgage property must be sold, subject to the encumbrance.
If the existence of a mortgage protects the property against the.
operation of the bankrupt act, all "lawful rights of married
women or minors, or any liens or other securities on property,
real or personal," are equally entitled to the protection claimed
under the proviso of the second. section of the bankrupt act,
How would it be possible to make any rational sale of the estate of the bankrupt, subject to these unascertained encumbrances . Neither the seller could possibly know the actual
value of what he was selling, nor the purchaser what he was
buying. Both would be acting perfectly in the dafk. Between
the .two modes of selling the encumbered property,- that of
selling it although shingled over with unknown liens, or liens
of unascertained amount or validity, subject to the whole of
them, or that of fairly selling it upon ample notice, liberated
from all encumbrances, good and bad,.and applying the proceeds first to the satisfaction of all "lawful rights of married.
women dr minors, or any liens, mortgages, or other securities,"
and the surplus, if any, to other creditors,- there cannot for a
moment be a doubt which is fraught with the most equity, justice, and propriety. The error of the argument of the defendant, in oppbsition.to the latter mode of sale, consists in considering it as annulling, de.troying, or impairing the lien. So far
from its having that effect, the precise object for which it was
created is accomplished by applying the proceeds of the mortgaged property to the satisfaction of the lien.. It no more anndlÂ§, destroys; or impairs the lien, than would be done by a.

502

judicial sale of the property under a judgment or the decree of
a .State tribunal. A mortgage cannot be justly or truly said to
be impaired or annulled when it has been fully satisfied, or satisfied to the extent of all the proceeds of the property mortgaged.
If it had been the intention of Congress to do any thing
more, in regard to mortgages and other liens, than to preserve
them unimpaired, - if it had been intended to exclude them
altogether from the operation of the bankrupt act, - different
language from that which was actually used w6uld, have been
employed." Thus in the third, the next section of the act to
that which has been under consideration, the language of the
proviso -is, " that there shall be excepted from the operation
of the provisions of this section the necessary household and
kitchen furniture," &c., clearly manifesting, that, with that exception, it was the purpose of Congress to vest in the assignee
the whole estate of the bankrupt, of every name and nature,
encumbered or unencumbered, to be administered by him with
due regard to the rights and privileges of all persons.
But it is useless to prolong the argument in support of the
interpretation of the bankrupt law, now contended for. Any
necessity for'it is wholly superseded by authoritative decisions
of the highest tribunals, federal and State. The jurisdiction of
the United States District Court, sitting in bankruptcy, over the
property mortgaged by the bankrupt, is supported and maintained by this court in the case Ex parte the City Bank of New
Orleans (the same bank which is defendant in this case) against
Christy, Assignee,'3 Howard's Reports, 292. Nothing can be
more full, clear, and satisfactory, than the reasoning employed
by this court in that case, and the conclusions at which it arrives. It was objected against it, in the court below, that the
decision was. extra-judicial; that it was not necessary to determine the point as to the jurisdiction over mortgages; and that
the cause went off by a refusal to grant the prohibition moved
for. It is true, that, if the Supreme Court had chosen to
shrink from any expression upon that point of its opinion, and
to stand non-committal, it might have limited itself to a simple
denial of the-prohibition. But it is respectfully conceived, that
such a course of darkness-would not have well corresponded
with the duty and dignity of that high tribunal. The point
fairly arose in the cause, was elaborately discussed in the argument, and was deliberately considered by the court. It arose
under a new law, just going into full operation throughout the'
whole extent of the United States, and subject to exposition
by a great variety of tribunals, federal and State. Conflicting,
Qr apparently conflicting, decisions were made, or in danger of

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

Houston et al. v. City. Bank of New Orleans.

being made, by inferior courts. All eyes were anxiously turned
to this court for light. The very party now objecting to the
authority of the pfecedent brought the point before the court,
and fully, ably, and confidently argued it. Under all these circumstances,-and considering the great necessity for uniformity
'of practice and decision under this new law, could this court
have justly and-honorably avoided settling definitively the controverted point? The court -thought it could not. The decision of such a question, which was attended with so much solemnity and considerati6n, cannot be regarded as obiter dicta,
or loose" expressions of judges, which accidentally fall from
them, without deliberation, during the progress of a trial.
But, to put the matter for ever at rest, this court subsequently reaffirmed all the doctrines and principles laid down previously in the prececling case, in Norton's Assignee v. Boyd and
others, 3 Howard, 434.
I will not go into an examination of the decisions of particular judges of the federal courts, acting on the circuits or in
the districts; for if they conflict with those already referred to,
they must yield to the paramount authority of this court.
If this decision of the question, by the highest tribunal in
the land, stood upon its own exalted authority and dignity
alone, it ought to command the respect and obedience of all
other tribunals, State and federal, within the United States.
For if the Supreme Court of the United States cannot finally
and definitively settie a controverted interpretation of a law of
the United States, our admirable but complicated system of
free government would be thrown, as to the administration of
justice, into utter and hopeless disorder and confusion. But it
does not rest upon the sole authority of this court. The Supreme Court of- Louisiana, by repeated decisions, fully and deliberately considered, had decided the same questioi in the
same way. Conrad, Assignee, &c., v. Prieur, Recorder, &c., 5
-Robinson, 49 ; Clarke, Assignee, v. Rosenda et al., 5 Robinson,
27; Benjamin, Assignee,.-v. Prieur, 5 Robinson, 59; Lewis v.
Fisk et al., 6 Robinson, 159.
It will be perceived, on an examination of these cases, that
they dover the whole ground of the question of the jurisdiction of the bankript court; and that it was thoroughly considered and most ably argurd. The Sulireme Court of Louisiana
declares, that, however the .question may be settled in other
States, the maintenance of the jurisdiction of the bankrupt
court is essential to the purposes of justice in'Louisiana; and
'that, if it be'not maintained, "it would be destructive of most
of the liens and securities intended to be protected by the lastproviso of the second section of the act of Congress," owing.

to the peculiar nature of the liens and mortgages as constituted
bydoubly
the laws of Louisiana.
. Thus
fortified by the solemn and deliberate decisions
of the highest judicial tribunal in the United States, and the
highest judicial tribunal of the State of Louisiana, the plaintiffs
had some right to suppose that they could not be disturbed in
the possession of property fairly purchased, and held by. them
under the sanction of these high authorities.
(Mr. Clay then replied to MIr. Sergeant's argument respecting the irregularity of the proceedings.)
III. That the caficelment and erasure of the defendant's
mortgage create an absolute bar to any relief which he now
seeks to subject the mortgage in the hands of third parties to
his demand.
IV. That the defendant, by his culpable silence and nonintervention, during the whole proceedings, from beginning to
end, and terminating in the consummation of-the sale of the
mortgaged -property by the passing of titles, has deprived himself of all right to the aid and assistance of a court of justice
to enforce his present claim.
(As the decision of the court did not turn upon either of
these points, the argument is omitted.)
Mr. Chief Justice TANEY d6livered the opinion of the court.
This case is brought here by a writ, of error directed to the
Supreme Court of the State, of Louisiana, under the twentyfifth section of the act of 1789. The record is voluminous,
and .ncessarily so .from the nature of the controversy in the
State courts. But the following summary statement contains
all the facts material to the question now before this court
upon-the writ of error.
In 1842, Thomas Banks, a citizen of New Orleans,: was
declared a bankrupt under the act of Congress to establish a
.uniform system of bankruptcy,. and F. B. Conrad appointed
his assignee. At the time of his bankruptcy he was the owner
of certain real property in New Orleans, called Banks's"Arcade,
upon which he had executed three several mortgages, all of
them outstanding and unsatisfied at the time he became a
bankrupt. The first was to the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company; the second to the Carrollton Railroad Com-.
pany; and the third to. the City Bank of New Orleans.
Upon the application of the assignde, the District Court of
the United States ordered those mortgaged premises to be
sold, anddirected that the mortgages should be cancelled, and
the property sold -free from encumbrance, rendering to the
parties interested their respective priorities in the proceeds. It

was accordingly sold, and purchased. by the appellants; and
they having complied with the terms of sale, conveyances
have been made to them by the assignee, and possession delivered.
Before -the money was -paid by the purchasers, there were
some proceedings in the State. courts in order to obtain the
actual cancellation of these mortgages in the office in which
they were recorded. But these proceedings are not material
to the question before this court, and it is unnecessary to. state
them.
After the sale was made and reported by the-assignee, the
New Orleans Canal and Banking Company, .which held the
elder mortgage, filed a petition in the District Court, praying
that the proceeds of the sale might be paid over to that bank;
the whole amount for which the prolerty was sold being insufficient to satisfy the debt due on that mortgage. The said
appears, before this application was made, conbank had, it,
sented to the sale by the assignee, and agreed that the moit:
gages in its favor should be cancelled, for the purpose of giving
titles to the purchasers, reserving its rights ,to be paid first out
of the proceeds.
But neither the Carrollton Railroad Company nor the City
Bank of New Orleans appeared in the District Court'in any
of the proceedings hereinbef6re mentioned, although regulprly
notified. N6r did either of them eÂ±hibit or prove any claim
ag~anst the bankrupt's estate, nor assent or object to the sale,
or to any of the proceedings therein.
-Subsequently, however, and after the proceedings upon this
subject in the District Court had been* completed, and the purchasers had complied with the terms 6f sale, and -received their
titles from the assignee, and been placed. in possession of the'
premises, the City Bank of New Orleans, which held the third
mortgage, instituted a suit in the Commercial Court of the
State, for the purpose of clharging the property in the hands
of the purchasers with the money due on its mortgage. The
purchasers resisted the claim, upon the ground that they were
entitled to hold the property free and discharged from this encumbrance, under the sale made' to them by. the assignee, as
hereinbefore stated. And the Commercial Court -having decided in favor of the validity of this defence, the bank appealed.
to the Supreme Court of the State, where the question was
raised and argued, whether, under the act of Congress establishing a unif6rm system of bankruptcy, the -purchasers -were
entitled to hold the premises free arid discharged from the mortgage to the City Bank.
.Upon this question the Supreme Court reversed thd judg43

ment of the Commercial Court, and adjudged that the property
.-should be seized by the sheriff, and s'old to satisfy the demand
of 'the bank. And itis this judgment of the Supreme Court
of Louisiana that is now before this court for revision.
The record manifestly presents a case within the. twentyfifth section of the act of Congress of 1789, and the jurisdiction of this court has not been disputed. The authority of
the District Court of the United States to order the sale of the
-property free from and discharged of the encumbrances, as
mentioned in the proceedings, was drawn in question, and the
,decision of the Supreme Court of the State was against the
validity of the:authority thus exercised by the District Court.
And this is the only question upon which this court is authorized to pass judgment; for the same section of the act of 1789,.
which gives jurisdiction in .the cases therein enumerated, forbids it to be exercised over any other questionwhich may have
-arisen in the case, or been decided by the State court.
The questibn, then, to be decided by this court is simply
this: -Are the purchasers under the sale made by the assignee
of Thomas Banks, as hereinbefore -stated, under the authority
of the District Court, entitled to hold the property free and
discharged from the mortgage and' encumbrdnce of the City
'Bank?
With every respect for the learned State court which has
decided against the right of the purchasers, we cannot persuade
'ourselves that it can be either necessary or proper, at this day,
for this court, in deciding a case like this, to enter into an
argument upon the construction of the bankrupt law, in order
tb vindicate its judgment. The power of the District Court
'over mortgages, in cases of bankruptcy, was fully argued and
considered in the tWo', cases reported in 3,Howard, 292, and
426, as appears by the opinions delivered by the court, and the
opinions of the justices who dissented. But-whatever difference of opinion existed as to some of the propositions maintamed in these cases by the majority of the court, there has
been no division of opinion upon a question like the one presented in this record. And the court are unanimously of opinion, that the sale made by the assignee of the property in question is valid, and that the purchasers are entitled to hold it free
and discharged from the mortgage to the City Bank, aid from
all other encumbrances mentioned in the proceedings.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana must

A bridge, held by an incorporated company, under a charter from a State, may be
condemned and taken as part of a pub ic road, tnder the laws of that State.
This charter was a contract between the State and the company, but, like all pnvate rights, it is subject to the right of eminent domain in the State.
The Constitution of the United States cannot be so construei as to take away this
right from the States.
Nor does the exercise of the right of eminent domain interfere with the inviolability
of contracts. All property is held by tenure from the State, and all contracts are
made subject to the right of eminent domain. The contract is, therefore, not
violated by the exercise of the right.
The Constitution oftthe United States intended to prohibit all such laws impairing
the obligation of contracts asinterpolato some new term or condition, foreign to
the original agreement.
Propert held by an incorporated company stands upon the same footing with that
held by an individual, and a franchise cannot be distinguished from ofher property.

THESE cases were brought up, by a writ of error issued un-

der the twenty-fifth section-of the Judiciary Act, from the Supreme Court of'udicature of the State of Vermont.

In 1795, the legislature of Vermont passed an act, entitled,
"An act granting to John W .Blake, Calvin Knowlton, and

their associates, the privilege of building a toll-bridge over
West River, in Brattleboro'"

The first section enacted that Blake, Knowlton, and -their
associates, should be and continue a body politic and corporate,
by the name of the West River Bndge Company, for one hun-

dred years, and that they should have the exdlusive privilege
of erecting and continuing a bridge over West River, within

four miles from the place where said stream united with Connecticut River.
