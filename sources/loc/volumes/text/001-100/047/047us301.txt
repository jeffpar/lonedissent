Where a bank was chartered with power to "have, possess, receive, retain, and
enjo to themselves and their successors, lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments,
goods, chattels, and effects of what kind soever, nature, and quality, and the
same to grant, demise, alien, or dispose of for the good of the bank,' and also
"to receive money on deposit and pay hway the same free of expense, discount
bills of exchange and notes, and to mike loans," &c., and, ill the course of business under this charter, the bank discounted and held promissory notes, and
then the legislature of the State passed a law declaring that "it shall not be lawful for any hank in the State to transfer, by indorsement or otherwise, any note,
bill receivable, or other evidenee of debt; and if it shall appear in evidence,
upon the trial of any action upon any such note, bill receivable, or other evidence
debt, that the same was transferred, the same shall abate upon the jplea of the
defendant," - this statute conflicts with the Constitution of the United States,
and is void.

TxESE two cases were both brought up, bywrit of error issued
under the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act, from the
High Court of Errors and Appeals for the State of. Mississippi.
They were kindred cases, and were argued together. Although the court pronounced an opinion in each case separately, yet the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Daniel treats them
as they were argued, and hence it becomes necessary to blend
the two cases together. The facts in each case will be stated,
then the arguments of counsel, and then the opinions of the
court, with the separate opinion of Mr. Justice McLean, and the
dissenting one of Mr. Justice Daniel.
PLANTERS' BANE V. SHARP. AND OTHERS.

On the 10th of February, 1830,the legislature of Mississippi
VOL. VI.

Planters' Bank- v. Sharp et a].

passed "An act to establish a Planters' Bank in the State of
Mississippi."
The sixth s~etion.of the charter enacts, among other things,
that the bank "shall be capable and able, in law, to have, possess, receive, retain, and enjoy to themselves and their succes-sors, lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and
effects, of what kind soever, nature, and quality, not exceeding
in the whole six millions of dollars, including the capital stock
of said bank, and the same to grant, demise, alien, or dispose
of for the good of said bank."
The seventeenth section "gives power "to receive money on
deposit and pay away the same free of expense, discount bills
of exchange and notes, with two or more good and sufficient
names thereon, or secured by a deposit of bank or other public
stock, and to make lbans to citizens oi the States in the nature
of discount on real property, secured by mortgage,"'&c.
The twenty-second section, enacted, "that it shall not be
lawful for said -bank to discount any note or notes.which shall
not be made payable and negotiable at said bank."
By a supplement to the charter, passed in 1831, and accept-.
ed by the bank,.it was provided that "such promissory notes
shall be made payable and negotiable on their face at some bank
or branch bank."
On the 24th of May, 1r39, Sharp, Engelhard, and Bridges
gave their promissory notc to the Planters' Bank for one thousand dollars, due twelve months after date. A copy of the note
is not to be found in the record, but the declaration states it -to
have been "payable and negotiable at the office of the Planters' Bank of the State of Mississippi, at Monticello2
On the 21st of February, 1840, the legislature of Mississippi
passed "An act requiring the several banks of the State to pay
specie, and for other purposes," the seventh section of which
was as follows: - "It shall 'not be lawful for any bank in this
State to transfer, by indoisement or otherwise, any note, bill
receiyable, or other evidence of debt; and if it shall appear'in
evidence, upon the trial of any action upon any such note, bill.
receivable, or other evidence of debt, that the same was transferred, the same shall abate uipon the plea of the defendant."
In October, 1841, the Planters' Bank brought a suit upon the"
note in the Circuit Court of Lawrence county (State court).
The defendants pleaded the general-issue, and a jury was sworn.
The declaration and note having been read, the defendants filed
the following plea: "And now, at this day, that is to say, on the second day of
the term aforesaid, until which day this cause was last continued, come the said plaintiffs, by attorney, and the said defend-

ants, by attorney; and the said defendants say, that since the
last continuance of this cause, that- is to say, since the sixth
day of the -May term, 1842, of this court, from which day this.
cause was last continued, and before this day, that is to say, on
the 10th day of June in- the year 184%, at the county aforesaid,
the said plaintiffs then and there being the owners of the said
note sued on in this cause, and then and there being a bank'
within the State of Mississippi, and within the intent and meaning "of the statute of this State, entitled, ' An act requiring the
several banks in this State -to pay specie, and for other purposes,' transferred the aforesaid note to the .United States Bank
of Pennsylvania, contrary to the statute in such cases made
and provided; and this the said defendants are ready to verify;
wherefore they pray judgment if the said plaintiffs. ought further to be answered in this said action, and that the same may
abate.
. "1Personally appeared in open court Thomas L.-Sharp, one of
the defendants in the above-stated case, who, being duly'sworn,
upon his oath says, that the matters and things set forth in the
above plea are true in substance and fact. Sworn to and subscribed in open court. ,
THOmAs L. SHARP."
The plaintiffs demurred toq this plea, upon the following
grounds:1st. Because said plea is not assigned by counsel.
2d. Because said plea does not state the day, year, time, and
place of the transfer of said note.
3d. Because the plaintiffs have a right by law to deal in
promissory notes, bills of exchange, &c., secured by charter.
4th. Because the statute, the title of which is recited in said
plea, is, so far as relates to transfers of notes, bills receivable, or
other evidence of debt, unconstitutional.
5th. That said plea does not state to what term said cause
was- continued.
6th. That said plea does not allege that said note was transferred for value received.
7th. That said plea is a plea in bar of this action, but does
not conclude in manner and form as provided by law.
8th. That said plea was not presented until issue joined under the plea of non assumjpsit, anc& the declaration and note
read, and a jury impanelled to try saidissue.
9th. That the statute referred to in said plea does not affect
the plaintiffs.
10th. That the said defendants did not tender the costs of
sut in said case, up to the time of their tendering said plea,

304

11th. That said plea is not entitled in this cause.
12th. That the affidavit subjoined to said plea is not sufficient.
The defendants having joined m -demurrer, the court, after
argument, overruled'it, and leave being-granted to the plaintiffs
to reply to the plea, an issue was joined in short by consent,
and the cause proceeded, when' the jury found a verdict for the
defendants.
A bill of exceptions was taken by the plaintiffs' counsel, as
follows, viz. : "Be it remembered, that on the trial of the above cause at
the term aforesaid, after the case was submitted to the jury,
and after the plaintiff had introduced his evidence upon the issue
joined, the defendant introduced a witness, who proved that,
since the suit in the above case was instituted, the note had
been transferred to the United. States Bank of Pennsylvania,
the defendants offered a plea, in the words and figures following, to wit: [Then followed the plea above recited.]
"To the reception of said plea the counsel for the plaintiffs
objected, which objection-was overruled; to which opinion of
the court the counsel for plaintiffs except, and having 'reduced
their exceptions to writing before the jury retired, pray the'
same may be signed [and] sealed.
"Given under my hand and seal this 6th December, 1942.
tSigned,)
A. G. BnowN. [sEAL.]"
Upon this exception, the case was carried up to the High
Court of Errors and. Appeals, which, at December term, 1842,
pronounced the folldwing judgment: "This cause having been submitted at a former term of this
court, and the same having been duly considered by the court,
it is ordered and adjudged, that the judgment of the Circuit
Court of Lawrence county, rendered against the plaintiffs in'
error at the 'December term thereof, A. D. 1842, be and 'the
same is hereby reversed, because rendered as a judgment in
bar; and this court, proceedifig to render the judgment that
should have been pronounced by the court below, doth order
and adjudge, that the plaintiffs in error, the plaintiffs in the
court below, take nothing by their writ, and that the suit be
abated."
To review this judgment, a writ of error brought the case
up to this court.
BADWIN,VAIL, AND HUFTY,v. JAMES PAYNE AND OTHERS.

Matthias W. Baldwin, George Vail, and: George W. Hufty,
copartners, brought this action on the 15th April, 1841, in the

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

305

Baldwin v. Payne et al.

Circuit Court of Jefferson county, Mississippi, against James
Payne, Abner E. Green, and Robert Y. Wood, the makers, and
the Mississippi Railroad Company, the indorsers, of two certain
promissory notes, each in the sum of $ 6,283.95, payable at the
Merchants' Bank, New Orleans, the first, sixty days after December 4, 1839, and the other ninety days thereafter. The
notes were without date on their face, and were -discounted, at
the instance of Payne, one of the makers, by the Mrississippi
Railroad Company, under their banking powers, on the said
4th December, 1839, to whose order they were mad& payable,
and were by said company, on the-lst day ofApril, 1841, indorsed over, transferred, and delivered to -the plaintiffs, for a
valuable considemtion.
The defendants, Payne, Green, and Wood, were served with'
'process, and appeared and pleaded the general issue. They
also pleaded the folloving special plea, viz.: -" That the said
promissory notes, in the declaration of the said -plaintifs mentioned, were executed and delivered by them, the said defendants, to, .nd discounted by, the Mississippi Railroad Company,
on the 4th day of December, in the year 1839, at the county
af6resaid, and thereby becamd and were the property of.the said
Mississippi Railroad Company, to wit, on the day and year
aforesaid, at the county aforesaid; and that the said promissory
notes continued to be and were the property of the Mississippi
Railroad Company from the day and year last aforesaid'until"and after the 26th day of April, in the year 1840, at the county
aforesaid; after which 26th day of April, in the year 1840; to'
wit,-on the 1st dlay of April, in the -year 18411 at the county
aforesaid, the said Mississippi Railroad Company, by their' indorsement thereon, transferred the said two promissory notes,
in the said declaration mentioned, to the said plaintiffs; and
this they are ready to verify. Wherefore they pray judgment,
if the said plaintiffs ought to have or maintain their aforesaid
action thereof against them."
To this special plea the plaintiffs demirred, and the defei..ants -joined in demurrer.
The Circuit Court, on the lith of November, 1842; sustained the demurrer, and awarded judgment of respbndnt ouster,
but the defendants refusing further to plead, the court thereupon gave judgment upon said de murrer to the second plea ror
the plaintiffs.
On the same day, the caiise, being dismissed as to theMississippi Railroad Company, came on for trial before a jury, on the
general issue, against the7 other defendants ; and a special verdict was found, as follows, viz. :- 'We, the jury, find that
defendants, James Payne,'Abner E. Greeui; and Robert Y. Wood,

SUPREME COURT.
Baldwin v. Payne et al.

executed the two several promissory notes (described in the
plaintiffs' declaration) on the 4th day of December, 1839, and
on the same day delivered the said notes to the Mississippi
Railroad- Company, to be discounted for and on a6count of
said James Payne; one of which said notes is for the sum of
$ 6,283.95, payable sixty days after the said 4th of December,
1839, to the order of the said Mississippi Railroad Company, at
the 'Merchants' Bank in- the city of New Orleans; and the other
of the said notes is for the sum of $ 6,283.95, also payable
ninety days after the said 4th of December, 1839, to the order
of the said Mississippi Railroad Company, at the Merchants'
Bank in the city of New Orleans. That said two notes were
discounted by said Mississippi Railroad Company, under their
banking powers, on the said 4th day of December, 1839, at the
instance of the first drawer, said James Payne, and the proceeds
thereof were received by him, and the said company thereby
became the holder of said notes. That the said notes, or either
of them, were not paid at maturity, and were presented for
payment at maturity, and protested for non-payment, and that
no part of them, nor any interest, has been paid by said defendants, or either of them. That the Mississippi Railroad Company, on the 1st day of April, 1841, being indebted to the
plaintiffs, Baldwin, Vail, and Hufty, transferred and delivered
said two several promissory notes to said plaintiffs, for a valuable consideration, in payment of said debts. If, upon the facts,
the court is of opinion that the law is in favor of the plaintiffs, we find for the plainiiffs, and assess their damages at
$ 15,300.90. But if, upon these facts, the court is of opinion
that. the law is for the defendants, Payne, Green, and Wood,
then we find in their favor."
The Circuit Court gave judgment, upon this special verdict,
in favor of the plaintiffs; -and the defendants thereupon took
a writ oferror to the High Court of Errors and Appeals. The
cause was argued in the Court of Errors, and on the 11th day
of November, 1844, the said court 'rendere.e their final judgment, viz.: -That
the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jeflferson county be reversed and foi nothing held, and that the
defendants in error, the plaintiffs below, take nothing by their
writ, and that the suit-is abated."
The charter' of the. Mississippi Railroad Company was con-'
ferred by an actf the legislature of Mississippi, approved February 26th, 1836, entitled "An act to incorporate the Mississippi Railroad Company." By the first section of a supplementpry act, passed Ma 12th, 1837, the company-were "anthorized'and empowered to exercise all the usual rights, powers, and pri-ileges of banking which are permitted to banking

institutions within this Slate, subject to the limitations and restrictions hereinafter.mentioned." And by section eighth of said
supplementary act, the company were, among other things,
made capable "to purchase and, sell real and personal estate,
and to hold and enjoy the same to any amount not exceeding
in value at any tune $ 500,000 over and above the property in.
and necessarily connected with said railroad." By the same
section, its "banking privileges, rights, and powers were secured to said company until the 30th day of December, 1858."
The Planters' Bank of the State of Mississippi was an incorporated banking institution, existing withn said State at
the date of the foregoing charter.
From the-above statement of these two cases, it is apuarent
that in the first one, viz. that of the Planters' Bank, the suit
was in the name of the original payees of the note, and in the
second; it was in the name of the mdorsees, being brought in
both cases against the makers of. the notes. The main question 'inboth was the constitutionality of the statute of Mississippi passed on the 21st of February, 1840.
The two cases were argued, as has already been remarked,
together, by Mr Wharton and Mlfr Sergeant, for the plaintiffs
in error, and by Mr Coleman,.Mr Gilpin, and Mr Webster,
for the defendants in error.
The counsel for the plaintiffs in error made- the following
points in the case of the Planters' Bank.
1. That by the final judgment of the High Court of Errors
and Appeals of Missi sippi in tins suit, there was drawn in
question the validity of the act of that State of the 21st day
of February, 1840, on the ground of its being repugnant to
the Constitution of the Umted States, and that the decision
was in favor of the validity of the act.
2. That by said judgment in tins smt, there was drawn in
question the construction of the tenth section of the first
article uf the said Constitution, winch declares that " no State
shall pass a law impairing the obligation of contracts," and
the decision was against the title and right specially set up
and claimed by the plaintiffs in error. under such clause of the
Constitution.
3. That. the charter and supplemental charter of the Mississippi Railroad Company is a contract, within the meaning of
the Oonstitution,,between the people of the State of Mississippi,
and the stockholders of the corporation and all claiming under
the charter.
4. That the said charter authorizes the bank to transfer

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

notes, bills receivable, and. other evidences of debt, belonging
to it, and to destroy this right impairs the obligation of the
aforesaid contract.
5. That the charter is an unqualified contract, and is all inviolable m point of obligation, and that the power to acquire
and transfer its property aforesaid may, of right, be exercised
with freedom from all restraints not contained m the charter,
nor imposed by the law of Mississippi when the charter was
granted, of which restraints, there were none.
6. That the said law of Mississippi cuts off all suit in case
of transfer, and is therefore unconstitutional.
7 That the said act is repugnant to the Constitution of the
United States, unconstitutional, and void.
In the case of Baldwin, Vail, and Hufty, the following was
an additional point.
That the plaintiffs in error were the holders of certain promissory notes put m suit by them, which they had purchased
for value from a company that by its charter had the right to
sell and transfer them, and that the judgment of the High
Court of Errors and Appeals in favor of the defendants below,
on the mere ground that the plaintifs had possession of said
notes by transfer from the Mississippi Railroad Company, impaired both the obligation of the contract between the State
and the company, and that between the makers of said -notes
and the holders.
Mr Wharton, for the plaintiffs in error, stated the circumstances of each case and the difference between them. The
point was the same in both, viz. the right to transfer the notes,
and the validity of the statute which forbid it. In the case of
the Planters' Bank the judgment of the State court was, that the
statute not only-disabled the bank from transferring, but also
that the bank itself had lost the right to sue, in consequence of
such a transfer having been made whilst the suit was pending.
The suit in this case was in the name of the original payees.
In.the other case the suit was brought by the mdorsees. The
transfer was pleaded as a defence, and the court sustained it.
Therefore the judgment of the, State court was, in the two
cases, that neither the payee nor mdorsee could maintain an
action where -a transfer had been made. We say that this
decision is contrary to the Constitution of the Umted States.
The
The principles upon which we stand are elementary
State law was passed in 1840, after the grant of the charter
and after the execution-of the notes.
(Mr Wharton then entered into a history of the decisions
of this and other courts upon the following propositions.)

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

309

Planters' -Bank v. Sharp et al.

1st. That a charter is a contract between a State and the
corporation. 6 Cranch, 87, decided in 1810. A grant is an
executed contract, and a repeal of the law cannot set it aside.
9 Cranch, 43, m 1815.
A legislative grant is not revocable. 4 Wheat. 518, in
1819, 1 Greenleaf, 79, in 1820.
A statute granting corporate powers, when accepted, becomes a contract. 15 Mass. 245, in 1819, 8 Wheat. 464, in
1823, 10 Conn. 522, in 1835.
2d. A bank charter is as much a contract as any other charter. This precise point has not often been made. The right
of a State to mcorporate a bank has been made a question in
one case only, viz. Peck,-269, Minor, Alab. R. 23, in 1820,
2 Stuart, Alab. R. 30, in 1829.
In both the last cases the court say that a bank charter is a
contract between the State and stockholders, -and cannot be
changed unless with the assent of both parties. 4 Peters, 514,
in 1830, where the tax was held constitutional, but the court
say that the contract with the bank must be protected. See
p. 560. 3 Wendell, 351, in 1832, 11 Peters, 257, in 1837
A bank owned wholly by a State is constitutional. 9 Wheat.
407, in 1824.
Such a contract is protected by the Constitution. .3 Howard,
1-33.
3d. No State can pass a law "impairing the obligation of a
bank charter. This is a corollary .from the other two propositions.
What, then, was-the contract in these Cases? The power-to
the Planters' :Bank is given in words as .comprehensive as possible. The only limtation is as to the amount of property to
be held. The railroad charter refers to and adopts the bank
charter. In both, there was a power to receive these notes, to
hold them, and to alien or -.sell them. Before the restraining.
statute was passed, it would not have been easy to doubt these
powers. The words, "1grant, demise, alien, or.dispose of," are
as comprehensive as any words that. could be used. "Goods,
chattelsi and effects" must include promissory notes. "Goods
and chattols" would do so, but-" effects" isstill stronger. The
legal meaning of "effects" is explained in Cowper, 299. Also
13 Tesey, 39, 47, note.
Corporations, unless restrained by their-charter, have control
over their property, and may alienate it. 1 Kyd on Corp. 108,

11 Vermont, 385, 2 Stuart, 401, 2 Wheat. 372, 5 Watts &
Serg. 223.
The next question is, What did the legislature do to impair
these rights ? It said that the smt should abate. It is true,
there was no'final judgment in bar, but the right of maintaining an action was cut off for ever. If both judgments of the
State court are correct, then neither the original payee nor the
transferee can sue. No one can sue. If the legislature had
merely forbidden the transfer, and suffered the original right of
property to remain in the bank, then the bank could have sued
for the use of the transferee. But the court have said that the
fact of transfer abates the suit brought in the name of the bank.
The legislature could not do this. 1 Murphy, 58, in 1805,
2 Hayw-ood, 310, 374, 2 Mass. 142, 143, in 1806, 7 Cranch,
184, m1812, 15 Mass. 447, in 1819, Peck, 1, 6 Wheat. 131;
6 Greenl. 112, 2 Penn. Rep. 184; 2 Yerger, 534, 7 Gill &
Johns. 7, 134, 2 Fairfield, 118.
This court usually adopts the State construction of -State
laws. 10 Wheat. 152', 41 Wheat. 361, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 313.
If, then, this court adopts the Mississippi construction of this
statute, all suits upon the notes are cut off, the contract is destroyed entirely There is no difference between taking the
whole or a part, if the obligation of the contract is impaired.
What is the obligation of a contract ? See 4 Wheat. 207, 197,;
4 Littell, 34, 47, 12 Wheat. 318.
The Constitution refers to a legal, and not a moral obligation, and depriving the party of all remedy impairs the legalobligation. 8 Mass. 430, 2.Gallison, 141, 2 Greenl. 294, 3
Peters, 290, 8 Wheat. 17, 1 Howard, 316, 317, 2 ib.'608.
Mr Coleman, for the defendants in error, laid down the following propositions 1. That the presumption is always in favor of the validity
of a law ;- and. that its invalidity or unconstitutionality must
be clearly demonstratedby the party attacking it.
2. That corporate powers are to be strictly construed, and'
that corporations possess only such powers as are specifically
granted them, or are necessary for the exercise of those expressly granted.
3. That neither by the charter of the Mississippi Railroad
Company, nor by that, of the Planters' Bank, nor by those of
any of the other banks of Mississippi which were incorporated
prior to the .year 1837, has the power to transfer pronssory
ilotes been expressly given.
4. That the power to transfer promissory notes is not necessary to the exercise or enjoyment of any of the powers that
have been expressly granted to said company.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

311

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

5. That the transfer or negotiation of promissory notes is
not a legitimate banking operation, but, on the contrary, is
subversive of the very end and object for which these institutions are chartered.
6. That the seventh section of the act of 1840 is neither a
partial law, nor does it divest vested rights, and that even were
it liable to both these objections, they alone would not render it
unconstitutional.
And as a conclusion necessarily flowing from the .maintenance of the foregoing propositions, we hold, lastly,
That the seventh section of the act of 1840 neither directly
nor incidentally impairs the obligation of any contract entered
into by the State of Mississippi with the Mississippi Railroad
Company, and is therefore a valid and constitutional law
Upon the 1st point. 4 Dall. 19, 6 Cranch, 128. The propositions laid down by the counsel on the opposite side are not
controverted. We-admt all three, but say that .the contract
is not impaired.
Upon the 2d point. 4 Peters, 168, 2 Cranch, 167, 4
Wheat. 636, 15 Johns. 358, Angell & Ames, '192 (2d ed.)
sec. 12, 2 Kent, 298, 299. Kent says that the modem doctrine is so. The cases cited on the other side are exploded.
3d point. If the argument upon the other side should be
correct as to the Planters' Bank, it does not follow that it is so
as to the railroad company, because only the usual banking
powers are conferred -"nonthe latter, and the power to transfer
notes is not a usual banking power. The purposes and objects of the company could be attained without this power.
Moreover, to construe the word "effects's as including promissory notes will make two clauses of the charter inconsistent
with, each other. The capital was three millions, and the
amount of notes issue& was not to exceed three times the
amount of capital paid in. Therefore the bank had a right to
issue nine millions. But the sixth section limits the amount of
property which it can hold to six millions. If notes are included within the "effects " of the bank, and it can hold only six
millions, then the two sections are inconsistent with each other, and the only mode of reconciling them is to construe the
words "1property" and "effects "1 as exclusive of the banking
capital. 3 Smedes & Marshall, 677, - this case, 8 Rob. La.
Rep. 417, 420, - a construction: of this same statute.
4th and 5th-points. The power does not necessarily follow.
If so, to what granted power is this uplied one necessary?
The bank may keep its notes till they are due, and then col-'

In the case -of Baldwin, Vail, and Hufty, the notes were
the property of the transferee. But no -case decides, that, if
the original party-had recover Md possession of the. note, a suit
could not be maintained upon it. , In the case of the Planters'
Bank, why did not the bank reply to the plea, that it had re-

gained possession of the note ? This would have brought the
question fairly up. The object of the legislature was not to
destroy the note, but merely to repeal its negotiability, conferred first by the Statute of Anne, and afterwards by the legislature of Mississippi. How. & Hutch. 373, sec. 12.
The argument upon the other side would be sound, if by
the charter the bank acquired an indefeasible right to transfer
notes, and it is said to be so because no existing statute then
prohibited transfers. But the property of negotiability is not
essential to a note. It was regulated by a general act of the
legislature,. and might with propriety have been repealed.
6th. "-The objection that this law is partial, and relates only
to banks, is not properly made here. This court has nothing
to do with such a question. But the proposition is denied, that
it is a partial law 6 Cowen, 512, 169, 15 Wend. 436.
Mr Gilpan, on the same side, said that the only question
before the court was whether or not the law of Mississippi ipaired the obligation of its contract with the bank. If it did,
no court would be more i dy to condemn it than the State
court of Mississippi. In this very case that court say - 11Legislation which impairs chartered rights is not only at-war with
the.-Constitution of' ;he United States, but it is repugnant to a
similar provision in our State constitution, and on that account
would be inoperative. But if both these instruments were silent, as to the power to nnpar the obligations of contracts,
such legislation is essentially repugnant to the protective spirit
of a well-organized government. In a government like ours,
such power is totally out of -the range of legislative authority,"
&c., &c.
No-State goes further to uphold this clause of the Constitution than Mssissippi. 1 Howard, Miss. Rep. 189, 6 ib. 672,
4 Smedes & Marshall, 507
Does the law in question impair the obligation of a contract?
It only modifies the previous law relating to the assignment of
debts or property, .bearing only on .assignments which took
-place after the passage. of the laW ;'it protects the debtor by
saying that he shall not be exposed to different liabilities than
those which, he took upon himself, it adheres to the original

placed themselves., it changed no obligation, but only forbade

Planters' .Bank v. ShIarp et al.

the transfer of that obligation to any one else. All that it
took from a promissory note was. the benefit of a statutory regulation. The common law gave no right- to °transfer such
property According to Coke, choses in action were- not. assignable. The right exists only by the Statute of Anne, and
courts have always confined, the privilege to the letter of the
law 5 Peters, 597, 16 Mass. Rep. 452, 14 ib. 108.
The statute of Mississippi, of 1822, made notes transferable, and her courts recognize this as the only foundation. of
the right to transfer. 7 Howard, Miss. Rep. 391, 2 Smedes
& Marshall,. 249.
With this public statute existing, the Planters' Bank was
chartered. It was to perform 'banking 6perations, -and nothing
else.
The sixth section enumerates its powers, and, if the right to
transfer exists, it must be-found-here.
The .seventeenth prescribes its banking duties, - to "1receive money," &c., not a -word about the transfer of notes.
The twentietb says it may issue bank-notes.
The twenty-second limits its issue to three'tnes the amount
of capital paid in and deposits.
The thirty-first says .it -may sell securities, when they are
mortgages. In all this, there is no right to transfer.
There is a distinction, all through the charter and.the supplement, between corporate powers and banking powers. The
first. are .only given to enable it to execute the latter.
But if the argument upon the other side- be sound, the
bank could do any thing. Under the general head of acquiring property, it might make a railroad.
The railroad company had less power- than the bank. Its
duties are specifically pomted out, and it is authorized to purchase and sell bills -of exchange, but not a word about notes.
In 1840 (Pamphlet Laws, 13,21), the legislature passed laws
to remedy the evils of-banks, to limit their issues, forbid dealmg in cotton, stocks, &c. Are'these all violations of the charter? In 1843, the legislature appointed commissioners to take
charge of the assets of banks. The object of the law of 1840
was to give notice that notes were not transferable, but that
the obligors should be protected. The assignee, therefore,
took these notes knowingly But the assignee 4 a bond cannot sue upon it after receiving notice that it is nbt 16 be transferred. Another object of the legislature was to compel-the
banks to receive their own depreciated paper in payment of
debts. The borrowers had received this paper, and an assignment would cut off the right of set-off. The policy of all
these laws will be defeated if the statute is overthrown.

Vol" vL

SUPREME COURT.
----Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

The foll0wnmg have been adopted as principles rn-construing
State laws

-

1st. Th# presumption is in favor of a State law 1 Dall. -14.
2d. A contract between a bank and a State must -be construed strictly. ,2Cranch, 167, Osborn v. Bank of -United
States, 9 Wheat. 738, 13 Peters,- 587, 15 Johns. 383., 2
Cowen, 700.
In the case before us, we are dealing with the contract between the'bank and State, not that between the parties to the
note. If it .were the lkatter, the rule is, that a party taking a
note after it is due takes it cum onere. 4 Dall. 370-; 13 Peters, 65.
The railroad company had no power to transfer vested u_.
it by the charter.

If it had the right at all, it must be found in

the charter as an express grant, or it must'have been held by
the muicipal law, which is always subject to be repealed.
As to the first branch. If granted in the charter, it must be
found in the words "1usual powers of banking." Does this
clause include a power to sell 7 Even if the Planters' Bank
had it specially, it would not pass to the railroad company
under this general clause. In other States, the power to sell is
not considered one of the usual banking powers. 1 Rev. Stat.
N. Y 178, see. 6, 9 Mass, Rep. 54, 2 Cowen, 710.
What is the doctrine of this court, as expressed in the cases
which have been decided? -There are only thirteen where
laws have been held unconstitutional, and not one of them is
like the present.
(Mr Gilpen here went through 4 critical examination of all
the cases referred to bythe opening counsel.)
Mr Webster, on the same side, referred -to all the laws of
the State relating. to the case, and also to a Territorial act
passed in 1812, and afterwards. adopted by the State. This
made bonds and notes assignable, whether drawn to order or
not, but made the assignee liable to all equity occurring before
notice of assignment.
Bills of exchange were exempted from the operation-of the
law of 1840. Why ) Because the sale-of them is expressly
granted in the seventh section of the supplemental act. Sellmg them might be one of the nischiefs intended to be guarded against. But the legislature found the power within the
charter, and therefore did not attempt to interfere with it.
In.the case of the railroad notes, there was a special verdict.
The counsel on the opposite side complain of it as a case of
hardship. But how is it made out? In December, 1839, two
notes were given, one payable in 60, and the other in 90 days.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

315

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

They were discounted on the same day Neither was paid.
They were protested, and remained so for more than a year.
The bank then stopped payment itself. On the 1st of April,
1841, the bank indorsed these notes to the plaintiffs in error.
So the jury find. But there is no purchase stated, no money
paid. They were transferred to pay a previously existing debt.
If the plaintiffs lose this suit, therefore, they are no worse off
than they were before. They took the notes to see what
they could make out of them, with the law staring them in the
face. There is no hardship in the case. '
The charter of the railroad company gave all necessary
powers. If a case could be shown where it was necessary to
sell notes, then the transaction would be'within the charter.
But it is difficult to make out such a case. The incidental'
powers of a corporation only reach and include what is necessary. 2 Kent, 298 (4th ed.), Angell & Ames, 195 (2d ed.),
chap. 5, sec. 2, and the cases there cited.
The amendatory act must be construed by the same rule.
The power must be given by express grant, or it must be essential to the proper exercise of some granted power.
1. As to an express grant. There is none such found, on
the contary, it is excluded by the clearest indications of the
act.

2. It is not essential. On the contrary, the exercise of it
would be dangerous and subversive of. the grant.
It has been said, that the express power is in the first and
eighth sections of the amendatory act, that the "usual powers of.banking" refer to the Planters' Bank, and that the.word
"effects" includes promissory notes, and the words "dispose

of" are equivalent to "transfer."
did not think so. The declaration says the notes were "indorsed_' tor the plaintiffs. The words of the law are, that they

cal. An indorsement is a new contract. The indorser parts
with the paper and makes himself liable.
But the seventh section is still stronger. It says that they
may "negotiate checks, drafts, and bills of exchange." If
promissory notes were intended to be included, here was the
place to put, them in.
If the sixth section included every thing, why insert this at
all ? The seventeenth section says, 11mnay discount bills of exchange and notes," "1may renew notes." This supposes that
the notes are lying in the bank, or they cannot be renewed.
The twenty-second section says that all notes must be payable
at the bank. This also infers that they must be there at all
tnes.

316

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

The limitation of the power to issue would be effectually
destroyed if the bank could sell and indorse notes. because
theie is no limit to such a proceeding. It is true, that the liability is contingent, but still it has ruined many corporations.
Is the power to transfer notes essential to the proper business
of banking? On the contrary,-it is entirely subversive of it.
It is indorsing other people's paper, - mere brokerage. When
the paper is assigned, interest upon it ceases to the bank. No
well-conducted bank is ever reduced to such an emergency as
to be obliged to sell paper.
(Mr Webster illustrated this by a reference to 3 Anderson's
History of Commerce, 143, for a history of the 'Bank of England; and then examined the decisions of this court which were
alleged to be hostile to the positions which he had assumed.)
Mr Sergeant, for plaintiffs in error, in reply and conclusion,
spoke first of the merits of the cases. The makers of the notes
had been represented to be willing to pay m the depreciated notes
of the bank. Why did they not- The note fell due and remained in the bank for a long time, during which they could have
paid in the notes of the bank. But they were now seeking to
avoid the payment of a just debt by setting up the policy of
the -State. We ask for the benefit of the Constitution of the
Uited States, which is paramount to Mssissippi laWs. The
principles of this court are now adopted by the courts of the
States, and it is a mistake to say tliat they are not acceptable
to the people. The States say, pass the law, and if it is wrong
the Supreme Court will overthrow it. If in these cases we
ask, Did you not make these notes ? the answer must be, Yes.
Did y1z not: promise to pay? Yes. Have you any defence
but the olie now set up, viz. the policy of the State 7 No.
But if a whole community are set free from paying their debts,
it is a policy which no one ought to wish to establish. This is
a far-fetched defence. The defendants have re.conciled their
own consciences to it, but they are under the influence of selfinterest. The aggregate of claims involved is two millions of
dollars, every one of which is as just as this one. The Planters' Bank was charteed in 1830. Afterwards there were four
more, the last in 1837 All these banks had an extensive capital, but the Planters' Bank was the favorite of -the State. It
was visible and felt everywhere. A mighty machine was set
up, and its accounts have now to be settled with the people of
the United States., Then came the railroad company, which
commenced as such, and was afterwards vested with banking
"powers. The object' of the supplementary charter was -to add
to, and not diminish, -its powers. It conferred the powers

JANUARY TERM, 1948.

317

Planters' Bank. . Sharp et al.

"usual for banking purposes," "authority-to deal in bills of
exchange." It has been said that this excludes "notes. ' But
by a fair construction it includes them, because it says, also,
"checks, bills," &c., and then gives the same power. over these
checks, &c., referring to notes. There-is no sense in the section upon any other construction. They have had a whirlwind
in Mississippi, but they sowed the wind. The notes were
given in 1839. Then every thing was right enough. The
bank could not collect them, because the debtors would not
pay What was the bank to do ? Keep. them in its drawer,
,and suffer its own creditors to remain unpaid? Keep its harvest locked up in the barn, and not give one sheaf to its creditors ? There was no use in keeping the notes. They were
given for a real consideration, and when suit was brought, there
was no pretence of any defence; The record shows that there
was none. There was no usury connected with them, and
they were negotiable on their face. The result' of"the two
suits together shows that all- remedy by suit is lost. This
court, in Bronson v. Kinzie, said that no additional burden
should be put upon the creditor, but herehis remedy is entirely
gone.
The statute says that the bank shall not transfer any "note,
bill receivable, or other evidence of debt." But it cannot pass
these things to its creditor without .transferring them, nor can
it make a general assignment to trustees without transferring
its choses in action. The laws of Mississippi do not prohibit
debtors from giving 'preferences.
This act Is retrospective. It acts upon existing contracts.
But this is in opposition to the judgment of this court in the
case of Bronson v. Kiniie. The opinion of learned and inlearned'men would concur in this. We need only take the
notes and the statute, and present the case to any mind. The
answer must be, that the claimants are now without remedy,
and that they are so in consequence of the law of 1840. Up
to the time of assignment,. the plaintiff was justly a creditor.
Now, his claim is extinguished for ever.
The object of the statute has been stated to be, to'compel
the banks to pay specie. But how can they do this, when
they are prohibited from selling the things which will bring
them specie 7 The charter required the bank to take paper
which,was "payable and negotiable at the bank." How negotiable 7 The law merchant describes this quality as passing
from hand-to hand by indorsement and delivery The object
must have been to give the bank the best kind of paper, such
as it could use in an emergency by selling. It has been said
that the word " enjoy," in the charter, does not imply the
27*

318

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

power of selling property, but how can a hungry man enjoy
a dollar in his pocket.without spending it?
It is an error to say that notes were not negotiable at common law There never was a tune in England when they
were not so. The Statute of Anne only-enabled the transferee to sue in his own name.
The State might as well have said that all bonds, mortgages,
notes, &c., should be at once void, as to have declared this
one so. If the legislature intended to protect debtors, thesystem of ethics has become inverted. Hitherto it has been
thought to be the duty of a legislature to take care of creditors
also.
They do not profess here to act only upon the remedy
They root up the contract. Before the act of 1840, the bank
had these notes in hand, and they we:e negotiable. The act
stopped their negotiability It has been said that there is no
authority in the charter to negotiate notes. Why? Because
the legislature knew that all individuals had the right, and
where a corporation was created, it would necessarily have it
also. One great duty of a corporation is to pay its debts.
Will it be said on ihe other side, that it cannot do so unless
expressly authorized in its charter? Under what law can it
make a general assignment? A corporation has no faculty to
do wrong. If it can use any other species of property to pay
its debts, much more can it use that kind which is most readily
applicable, most convenient, and most proper, namely, its own
evidences of debt.
1Mr. Justice WOODBURY delivered the opimon of the court.
PLANTERS' BAINK V. SHARP ET AL.

The question to be considered in this case is, whether an
act of the legislature of Mississippi, passed February 21st,
1840, impaired the obligation of any contract which the State
or others, had previously entered into with the Planters' Bank.
If it did, the clause in the Constitution of the United States.
expressly prohibiting a State from passmg any such law, has
been violated, and the plaintiffs in error are entitled to judgment.
But, onthe contrary, .if that act does not iinmir the obligation of any contract, the judgment below in favor of the defendants must be affirmed.
In considering this question, no- peculiar liberality of construction in favor.of a corporation, so as to render that -an encroachment on its rights which is not clearly so, seems tb be
demanded of us by any more sacredness in the character of a

JANUARY TERM, '1848.

319

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

corporation or its rights than im that of an individual, .but
ratherl that its charter as a public grant is'not to be construed
beyond its natural import. 8 Peters, 738, 3 Peters, 289,
4 Peters, 168, 514. The inviolability of contracts, however,
and the faithful protection of vested rights, are due to the one
no less than the other, and are both involved in the present
mquiry, so far as affecting, by way of principle or precedent;
all the various and vast interests of this kind existing over the
whole Umon.
Mr. Madison denotnced laws unpairmg the obligation of
contracts as among those not, only violating the Constitution,
but "1contrary to the first prznciples of the soctal-,compact and
to. every prenctple of sound legislation." (Federalist, No. 44.
Again, in Payne et al. v. Baldwin et al:, 3g'Si&aes"& Maishall,-677, one of:the cases now before us, it is truly admitted,
that, "in a-government like ours, such power is totally out of,
the range of legislative authority"
At the same tune, it is to be recollected that our legislatures
stand in a position demanding often the most favorable construction for their motives in passing laws, and they require a
fair rather than hypercritical view of well-intended provisions
in them. Those public bodies must be presumed to act from
public considerations, being in a high public trust-; and when
their measures relate to matters of general mteYest, and can'be
vindicated 'under express or justly iniplied powers, and more
especially when they appear intended for improvements, made
in the true spirit of the age, or for salutary reforms in abuses,
the disposition in the judiciary should be strong to uphold them.
Certainly, it will be only when they depart from limitations
or qualifications of this character, and so use 'their own rights
as to impair the prior rights of others, that a -check must be
used, however unpleasant to -us, by declaring, that the constitutional restrictions of the general government must control
a statute of a State conflictmg with them, and thus, for harmony and unifority, make the former supreme,, in compliance
with the injunctions imposed by the people and the States
themselves in the Constitution. Governed by such views, we
proceed to the examination of the questions. arising here, by
ascertaining, first, what powers the legislature of Mississippi
granted to the plaintiffs, and then what powers it has taken
away from them.:",
On the 10th of February,. 1830, "An act to establish a
Planters' Bank in the State of Mississippi" passed, and, among
other privileges, 'in the sixth section, granted that the bank
"shall be capable and able, in law, to have, possess, receive,
retain, and enjoy, to themselves and their successors, lands,

320

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and effects, of
what kind soever, nature, and quality, not exceeding in the
whole six millions of dollars, including the capital stock of said
bank, and the same to grant, demise, alien, or dispose of, for the
good of said bank."
The seventeenth section gives power, also, CL to receive
money on deposit, and pay awayothe same free of expense,
discount, bills of exchange and notes, with two or more good
and sufficient names thereon, or secured by a deposit of bank
or other public stock, and to make loans to citizens of the
States in the nature of discount on real property, secured by
mortgage," &c.
Doing business with these powers, amounting, as it has been
repeatedly settled, to a contract in the charter for the use of
them (see cases in the West River Bridge, at this term), the
bank, on the 24th of May, 1839, took the promissory note on
which the present suit was instituted, and, on the 10th day of
June, 1842, transferred it to the Umted States -Bank, having
first commenced this action on it, the 11th of October, 1841.
But in the mean tune, after the execution of the note, though
before its transfer, the legislature of Mississippi, on the 21st day
of February, 1840, passed a law, the seventh section of which.
is in these words -" 1 It shall not be lawful for any bank in
this State to transfer by indorsement or otherwise any note, bill
receivable, or other evidence of debt, and if it shall appear in
evidence, upon the trial of any action upon any such note, bill
receivable, or other evidence of debt, .that the same was transferred, the same shall abate upon the plea of tho defendant."
(See Acts-of 1840, p. f5.) This law constitutes the only defence to a recovery in the present case by the plaintiffs. But
they contend it is invalid, because, by the Constitution, art. 1,
§ 10, "1no State" shall pass any law "impairing the obligation
of contracts", and this law does impair it, in this instance, in
two respects. First,in the obligation of the contract in the charter with the State, and secondly, in thevi ligation of the contract made by the signers of the note declared on with the bank.
To decide understandingly these questions, it will be necessary to go a little further into the true extent of those two contracts under the powers held by the bank, and likewise into
the true extent of the subsequent act of the legislature affecting them.
That promissory notes are to be regarded as either goods,
chattels, or effects, within the sixth- section of the charter, can
hardly be questioned, when it includes these " of what kind
soever, nature, and quality"
This addition evidently. meant
to remove any doubt or restriction as to the meaning of those

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

321

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

terms, as sometimes employed in connection with peculiar subjects, and to extend the description by them to every kind of
personal property belonging to the bank. This construction
would go no further than sometimes has been done in England,
holding the words goods and chattels to include choses -in action, as well as other personal property (12 Coke, 1;- 1 Atkins,
1182), and by the word goods alone, in a bequest, it has been
held that a bond will pass (Anonymous, 1 P Wins. 127).
So, in respect to efect&, it has been held, when the word is
used alhne, or szmpliciter, it means all kinds of personal estate.
13 Yes. 39, 47, note, Michell v. Michell, 5 Madd. 72, Hearne
v. Wigginton, 6 Madd. 119, Cowp. 299. But if there be
some word used with it, restraimng its meaning, then it is governed by that, or means something ejusdem generts. Here,
however, instead of restraining terms being used with it, those
most broad and enlarging are. added, being "effects of what
kind soever, nature, and quality's Hotham v. Sutton, 15-Yes.
$26, Campbell v. Prescott, 15 Ves. 500, 3 Yes. 212; note.
The same rule prevailed in the civil law, u4der the term
bona mnobilia. (1 P Wins. 267) And by that law, as well*
as the common law, pronussory notes or choses in action come
under the category of movable goods or personal property, as
they accompany the person. 2 Bl. Comm. 384, 398.
The 'bank was allowed, also, by the seventeenth section, "to
discount bills of exchange anct notes ", and, in truth, promis.
sory notes usually constitute a large portion of the property of
such institutions. Such notes, also, not only by general usage
and established forms, are, in most cases, made to run to banks
or their order, and must be expected to run so when the banks
please, but it is expressly provided, by the twenty-second section of this charter, that "it shall not be lawful for said bank
to discount any note or notes which shall not be made payable
and negotiable at said bank," &c. And, again, by an nendatory act, accepted by the bank, it was provided, on the 9th of
December, 1831, "that such promisspry nozes shall be made
payable and negotiable on their face at some bank or branch
bank."
But why. made negotiable, if no right was to exist to negotiate or transfer them ? The bank, then, as the legal holder
of such notes, possessed a double right "to dispose" of them,
first, from the express grant in the charter itself, empowering
them, as to their "goods, chattels, and effects, of what kind soever, nature, and quality," "the same to grant, demise, alien,
or dispose of, for the good of said bank ", (sixth section , secondly, by an implied authority, incident to its charter and
business, and the express requirement that the notes should be

322

SUPIEME COURT.,
Planters' Bank, v. Sharp et al.

'-(negotiable on their face2' We do not refer to the next
ground because it is.necessary to'*resort to implication or
analogy to establish an authority in the bank under its charter
to. make a -transfer of its notes, whenit pssesses that authority Dy the very words and spirit of the contract made in the
charter by the State.
But to make the corredtness of this conclusion from the
specific, words, of the charter stronger and undoubted, it will
be found to be the natural, useful, and proper view of its powers as a bank, under all sound analogy and necessarily implied
authority
To reach this end, it is not indispensable to 'hold that torporations in modem tunes possess numerous incidental powers,
equal to those of individuals, as -was once the doctrine (Kyd
on Corp. 108, 2 Kent, Comm. 281, and cases in those treatises), but seems now in some respects overruled. Earle v. Bank
of Augusta, 13 Peters, 519, 587, 153, 2 Oranch, 167, 12
Wheat. 64. Bvt merely to hold, as it often has been in late
years, that what is necessary and proper to be done to carry
into effect express grants, and which is nowhere forbidden,
may in most cases be lawful.
Though such a power as this last to Congress is expressly
added in the Constitution of the United States, yet it has been
considered by some that it would exist as a reasonable incident,
under reasonable limitations, without any such express addition.
2 Kent, Comm. 298, and cases there cited.
' Thus a corporation, if once organized, has the implied power
to make contracts connected with its business and debts, and
through agents and notes as well as under its seal. Bank of
Columbia v. Patterson's Adm'r, 7 Cranch, 299, 8 Wheat. 338,
12 Wheat. 64, 11 Peters, 588.
So it may hold and dispose of property even in trust, if not
inconsistent and unconnected with its express duties and objects. Vidal et al. v. Girard's Ex'rs, 2 Howard, 127
Hence a power to dispose of its notes, as well as other prop-.
erty, may well be regarded as an incident to its business as a
bank to discount notes, which are required to be in their terms
assignable. as well as an incident to its right of holding them
and other property, when no express limitation is imposed on
the authority tQ transfer them.
Not that a banking corporation has under its charter a constructive power to follow another independent branch of busihess, such as manufacturing or foreign trade, but merely the
business 6f banking, and to do such acts as are necessary and
proper or usual to carry that business into effect, and such as
are inharmony with the letter and spirit, of its charter.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et a].

Nor even that it can adopt any course as an incident, and
as necessary and proper, which is merely convenient, or which
is expressly forbidden by the charter, or so forbidden by any
previously existing laws m the State of a general character.
But in discounting notes and managmg its property in legitimate banking business, it must be able to assign or sell those
notes when necessary and proper, as, far instance, to procure
more specie in an emergency, or return an unusual amount of
deposits withdrawn, or pay large debts for a banking-house,
and for any "goods and effects" connected with banking
which it may properly own. It is its duty to pay in some
way every debt. 6 Gill & Johns. 219. This court, in the
Umted States v. Robertson, 5 Peters, 650, has expressly recognized the authority of a bank to give bonds and assignments
to pay its deposit debtors. In that case, "the directors agree
to pledge to the government of the Umted States the entire
estate of the corporation as a security for the payment of the
original principal of the clain," &c. (p. 648). And vach a
pledge or-transfer was held there to be valid.
It is said, in opposition to this, Why should a bank be considered as able to mcur debts? or why to do any business on
credit, requiring sales of its notes or other property to discharge its liabilities? Such inquiries overlook the fact, that
the chief business and desigii of most banks, their very vitality, is to incur debts as well as have credits. All their deposit
certificates, or bank-book credits 'to individuals, are debts of
the bank, and which it is a legitimate and appropriate part of
its business as a bank to mcur and to pay. The same may be
said, also, of all its bank-notes, or bills, they being merely
promises or debts of the bank, payable to their holders, and
imperative on them to discharge. See Bank of Columbia v.
Patterson's Adm'r, 7 Cranch, 307, 13 Peters, 593.
It may, to be sure, independent of justifications like these,
not be customary for banks to dispose of their notes often.
But in exigencies of indebtedness and other wants under pressures like those Teferred to, it may not only be permissible, but
much wiser and safer to do it than to issue more of its own
paper, too much of it being already out, or part with more of its
specie on hand, too little being now possessed for neeting all its
obligations. Indeed, its right to sell any of its property, when
not restricted in the charter or any previous law, is perhaps as
unlimited as that of an individual, if not carried into the transaction of another separate and unauthorized branch of business. (Angell & Ames on Corp., p. 104, § 9, 4 Johns. Ch,
307, 2 Kent, Comm. 283, 11 Serg. & Rawle, 411.) Both

acquired under mortgages foreclosed, or acquired under the extent of executions not redeemed. Both, too,.must be able-to
sell all kinds of their property, when proceeding to close up their
business, or find it impracticable. Nor is there any pretence
here that any clause in the charter of this bank restricted it
from selling its notes or other property under any.circumstances, and .much less under those, connected with indebtedness
and with banking, which have just been referred to. It will be
seen, in this way, that all analogies seem to sustain the right
which exists by the express grant in this charter, to "alien. and
dispose of" all its "goods, chattels, and effects, of what kind
soever, nature, and quality, for the good of said bank." But
to avoid differences of opinion, we place the right here solely
on the express grant. It ought, perhaps, to be added, that the
courts of Mississippi once put a more limited construction on
this charter. Baldwin et al. v. Payne et al., 3 Smedes & Marshall, 661.
But as that very case is now before us for revision, on the
ground that it was erroneous, we feel obliged, for that and other
reasons, which need not be here enumerated, to put such construction on the charter, and on the law supposed t6 violate iV,
as seems right according to our own views of their tru&intent.
Having thus ascertained the extent of the contract made by
the State with the bank in the charter, we proceed next to examine the character and scope- of the contract between the
maker of the note and the bank.
We have already seen that the bank was not only authorized,
but expressly required, to discount notes which were negotiable,
or, in other words, which contained a contract or stipulation to
pay them to any assignee. Nor is it pretended there was any law
of Mississippi, when this charter was given or when this note
was taken, which prohibited selling it, and passing to an assignee all the rights, either of property or of bringing a suit in
his own name, which then existed with individuals and other
banking institutions.
What law existed on this point when the note was actually
transferred is not the inquiry, but what existed when it was
made, and its obligations as 4 contract were fixed. The law
which existed at the transfer, so far from being the test of the
force of a contract made long before, and under different legal
provisions, is the violation of it, and the very ground of complaint in the present proceeding.
'This contract, then, by the bank with the maker, when executed, enabled the former to sell or assign it, and the mdorsee
to collect it, not only by it8 express terms, but by the general
law of the State, then allowing transfers of negotiable paper

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

325

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

and suits in the name of indorsees. Howard and Hutchinson's
Laws, 373.
Indeed, independent of the last circumstance, it is highly
probable, that, by the principles of the law of contracts and commercial paper, such choses in action may b6 legally assigned or
transferred everywhere, when not expresslv prohibited by statute. This was done before the Statute of Anne, in England.
And it is done since, as to paper both negotiable and not negotiable, independent of thdt statute.
If such notes cannot be sued in the name of the mdorsee,
when runmng to order, witho.ut the help of a statute, they
certainly can be sued in the name of the payee, for the benefit
of the mdorsee, when the transfer is legal n its consideration

and form.
The State itsef, by passing this law prohibiting the transfer
of notes by banks, recognizes the previous right, as well as
custom, to transfer them, otherwise, the law would not be
necessary to prevent it. Nor is this law supposed to have been
founded on any prior abuse of power in negotiating or sellihg
its notes, which, if existing, might obviate the above inference.
But it is understood, from the record and opinions of the State
court, that the design of the law was to secure another provision of statute not previously existing, but made by the legislature at the same time, requring banks to receive their own notes
in payment of their debtors, though below par. That design,
too, would still recognize the prior authority to sell or transfer.
'We are not prepared to say that a State, underits general
legislative powers, by which all rights of property are held and
modified as the public interest may seem to demand, might
not, where unrestricted by constifutions or its own contracts,
pass statutes prohibiting all sales of certain kinds of property,
or all sales by certain classes of persons or corporations. 14
Peters, 74. Such has often been the legislation as to property
held in mortmam or by aliens or certain proscribed sects in religion.
This is, however, very invidious legislation, when applied to
classes or to particular kinds of property before allowed to be
held- generally Legislation for particular cases or contracts,
without the consent of all concerned, is of very doubtful.validity. Merrill v. Sherbume et al., 1 New Hamp. 199. Under
our system of government, and the abuses to which in various
ways and to various extents that kind of legislation-might lead,
several of the State constitutions possess clauses prohibitory of
such a course where it affects contracts or vested rights, and
more especially does the Constitution of the -Umted States expressly forbid any such legislation, whenever it goes to mVon. v1.

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

pair the obligation of a contract. Hence, the general powers
which still exist under other governments, or might once have
prevailed here in the States, to change the tenure and rights
over property, and especially the jus disyonendi of it, cannot
now, under the Federal Constitution, be exercised by our States
to an extent affecting the obligation of contracts.
The next and final question, then, is, Did the act in question impair the obligation, either of the contract by the State
with the bank, or of the contract by the maker of the note
with the bank?
We have'already ascertained the true extent of both of these
contracts before this act passed, that by the State with the
bank clearly allowing it to take negotiable notes, and to sell or
transfer them, and that with the maker clearly enabling the
bank to assign his note, and a recovery to be had on it after
a transfer, by the assignee. In this condition of things, with
this note taken and held. accompanied by such rights and obligations, the legislature of Mississippi passed the law already
quoted, and now under consideration. It expressly took away
the right of the bank to make any transfer whatever of its
notes, and virtually deprived an assignee of them of the right
to sustain any suit, either in his own name or that of the bank,
to recover them of the maker.
-The new law, also, conferred in substance on the maker a
new right to defeat any action so brought, which he would
otherwise have been liable to. These results vitally changed
the obligation of the contract between him and the bank, to
pay to any assignee of it, as well as changed the obligation of
the other contract between the State and the bank m the charter, to allow such notes to be taken and transferred. It is true
that this new law might bear a construction, that the transfer
w-as only a voidable act, and not void, and that, if cancelled or
ivaived, a recovery might afterwards be had on the note by the
bank, and this seems to have been the view of some of the
court in 3 Smedes & Marshall, 681, as well as in Hyde et al. v.
The Planters' Bank, 8 Robinson, 421. Yet the State court in
Mississippi appears finally to have thought it meant otherwise,
and to have decided that no suit at all can be sustained on such
a note by any body after a transfer. This was the view which
they think influenced the legislature. See Planters' Bank v.
Sharp et al., 4 Smedes & Marshall, 28. We are disposed to
acquiesce in the correctness of this construction, as it seems
to. conform nearest to the real designs of the legislature. But
this view is not adopted, because a decision by a State court
on a State statute, though generally governing us, is to control
here in the very cases which, on account of that decision, are
brought here by appeal or writ of error.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

327

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

The rights of a party under a contract might improperly be
narrowed or denied- by a State court, without any redress, if
their decision on the extent of them canndi be reviewed and
overruled here in cases of this kind, while their decision, if
restrictmg or enlarging the prohibitory act, might more, safely
stand, as doing no injury m the end, if we hold the act null
wherever it is construed by them or us so as .to conflict with
prior rights obtained under contracts. See Commercial Bank
t. Buckinghams Ex'rs, .5 Howard, 317
If the State courts of- Mississippi should hereafter adopt the
dissenting opinion of Judge Sharkey, in 4 Smedes- & Marshall,
28, and go back to what they appear to have before held, in
3 Smedes & Marshall, 66t ,--namely, that the right to sue by
the bank, after-a transfer, was not taken away, if the plaintiff
ioeplied that the transfer had been rescinded, and the interest
was now solely in the bank, -and should that construction be
adopted here, the force of this new law, as impairing the obli-gation of the contract, might not be so extensive and clear as
now But still it would seem to impair the contract in some
respects, yet whether .n such way and extent as to render the
obligation itself changed must be left to be decided definitively-when such a case is presented for our decision. In the present instance, however, as before explained, the extent and operation of the prohibitory law being regarded as forbidding any
transfer whatever, and, if it takes place, as barring every kind
of remedy on the note, the decisive question may be repeated,
How can this happen without injury to the plaintiff's contracts? When every form of redress on a contract is taken
away, it will be difficult to see how the obligation of it is not
impaired. Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 76, 1 Howard, 317, 4
Smedes & Matshall, 507, King v. Dedham Bank, 15 Mass. 447
If any right or power be left, under the note, by this act,
after a transfer is made, it is of no use, when it cannot be enforced and no benefit be derived from it, but an action abated
toties quoties as often as it is instituted. 8 Wheat. 12, 1 B1.
Comm. 55. In the mildest view, a new disability is thus attached to an old contract, and its value and usefulness restricted, affd these of course impair it. Society for Propagating
the Gospel v. Wheeler, 2 Gall. '139One of the tests that a contract has been impaited is, that. its
value has by legislation been diminished. It is.not, by the Constitution, to be impaired at all. This is not a question of degree
or manner or catise, but of encroaching in any respect on its
obligation, dispensing with any part of its force. The Commercial Bank of Rodney v. The State of Mi issippi, 4 Smedes
& Marshall, 507 So, if the obligation of a contract is to be re-

328

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al,

garded as the duty imposed by it, here the duty imposed by
the State to adhere to its own deliberate grant, and the duty
imposed on the signer of the note to make payment to an assignee, as well as to the bank itself, are both interfered with
and altered.
In answer to this supposed violation of -the contract between
the maker of the note and the bank, some objections have
-been urged which deserve further notice here.
It is sometimes stated, with plausibility, that States may
pass insolvent laws, suspending or taking away actions on contracts, where the debtor goes into insolvency, and hence, by
analogy, can do it here. But there another remedy is still
given on th, contract, before the commissioners of insolvency,
and a.payment is made pro rata, as far as means exist. Here
there is no other remedy given, or any part payment made.
Indeed, it seems that a forfeiture of all right to recover on the
note, in any way, is inflicted here as a penalty for making that
very transfer which thel bank before, by the act of incorporation, as well as by thq note itself, was authorized to make.
Again, State insolvent laws, if made, like this law, to apply to
past contracts and stop suits. on them, have been held not to
be constitutional except so far as they discharge the person
from imprisonment, or in some other"way affect only the remedy When so restricted, they do not impair the obligation of
the contract itself, because the obligation is left in full force
and actionable, and future property, as well as prxsent, subjected to its payment, and the body exonerated only as a matter
connected merely with the form of the remedy Cook v. Moffat; 5 Howard, 316, and cases there cited. The case in 8
Robinson, 421, appears also to have been one on a note executed after the prohibitory law, and not, as here, before. But
where future acquisitions are attempted to be exonerated, and
the discharge extended to the debt or contract itself, if done
by the States, it must not, as here, apply to past contracts, or
it is held to impair their obligation. Ogden v. Saunders, 12
Wheaton; 213, Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheaton, 122, 6
Wheaton, 131, 2 Kent, Comm. 392, Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 Howard, 311, McCracken v. Hayward, 2 Howard, 608, 1 Cowen,
321, 16 Johns. 237, 1 Ohio, 236, Cook v. Moffat, 5 Howard,
308, 314. Congress alone can do this as to prior contracts, by
means of an express permission in the Constitution to pass
uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, and which laws,
when not restrained by any constitution or clause like this as
to States impaifing contracts, may ifi that way be made to
reach past obligations.
The misfortune here is, that 1he legislature, if meaning

merely to insure to bill-holders of the bank, when debtors, the
privilege of paying m the bills of the bank (as is supposed, 4
Smedes & Marshall, 1, 90), have not -sdid so, and no more, by
providing that promissory notes, though assigned by banks,
should still be open to set-offs by their debtors of any of their
bills which they then held. This would have been equitable, and no more, probably, than they would be entitled to,
on common law principles, if an assignee purchased, as here,
after the promissory notes fell due, and perhaps with a knowledge of the existence of such a set-off.
Chief Justice Marshall, in The United States V.Robertson, 5
Peters, 659, says, independent of any statute, "1every debtor
may-pay his creditor with the notes of that creditor. They
are an equitable and legal tender." Equally just and reasonable
would have been a declaratory law as to the allowance of such
bills "as a set-off, where an assignment had been made collusively between the parties with a view to prevent such a setolf. 8 Robinson, 421.
'But instead of resorting to such measures, the legislature
adopted a shorter and more. sweeping mode of attaining the
end of preventing assignments which might embarrass or defeat set-offs. They did it by cutting off all assignments what.ever, and all remedies whatever upon them. And they accompanied this by another statute, enabling debtors of the bank who
held its notes, when their debts fell due, to pay in them, or set
them- off, and even virtually authorized them to make payment
in depreciated bills -or notes afterwards bought up for that
purpose, and thus to-gain an undue advantage over set-offs by
other debtors in other matteis.
The act as to this last'toplc was passed the next day after the
act prohibiting transfers. Mississippi Laws, 2 February, 1840;
p. 21, sec. 2. It was in these words - " All banks above alluded to, and all other banks in this State, shall at all times receive their respective notes at _par in liquidation of their bills
-receivable and other claims dire them."1 These two acts, though
undoubtedly well meant, and designed to give an honest preference to bill-holders (see Sharkey's dissenting opinion) as to a
paper currency which ought always to be kept on a par with
specie, were unfortunately, in the laudable zeal to avert a j reat
apprehended evil, passed, without sufficient consideration of
the limitations of the powers unposed by the Constitution of
the Umon on the State legislatures, not to impair the obligation
of existing contracts. Nor was it necessary to go so far to secure any legitimate results. Some other laws are referred to,
which are upheld and which affect the whole community, and
seem to violate some of the important- incidents of contracts

t al.

between individuals, or between them and corporations. But
it will usually be found that these are such laws. only as relate to future contracts, or if to past ones, relate to modes
of proceeding in courts, to the form of remedy merely, to
priority to some classes of creditors (5 Cranch, 298), to the
kind of process (9 Peters, 319, 10 Wheat. 51), to the length
of the statute of limitations (6 Wheat. 131, 2 Mason, 168, 3
Johns. Ch. 190, 4 Wheat. 200, 1 Howard, 315), to exempting
the body from impnsonment (4 Wheat. 200), or tools and household goods from seizure (16 Johns. 244, 1 Howard, 15, 11 Martin, 730), or affecting some privilege attached to the person or
territory (Story on Confl. of Laws, 339, &c.), and not to the
terms or obligations of any part of the contract itself (Cook V.
Moffat, 5 Howard, 295, Towne v. Smith, 1 Woodb. & Minot,
132, 7 Greenl. 337, 3 Burge on Col. & For. Law, 234,
1046).
And if, in professing to alter the remedy only, the duties and
rights of a contract itself are changed or impaired, it comes
just as much within the spirit of the constitutional prohibition.
Bronson v. Kinzie et al., 1 Howard, 316, 2 Howard, 612, 2
Madison Papers, 1239, 1581.
Thus, if a remedy is taken away entirely, as here, or clogged
"by condition of any kznd, the nght of the owner may indeed
subsist and be ucknowledged, but it is smpaired." Green v.
Biddle, 8 Wheat. 75. And the test, as before suggested, is not
the extent of the violation of the contract, but the fact, that in
truth its obligation is lessened, in however small a particular,
and not merely altering or regulating the remedy alone. 2
Howard, 612, 8 Wheat. 1.
Having, it is believed, assigned sufficient reasons to show
that the obligation of both of these contracts was impaired, it
is.now. proposed briefly, to refer to a few precedents bearing on
the correctness of this conclusion, chiefly m respect to the most
important 6f the contracts, - that between the State and the
bank. On an examination of the various decisions which have
taken place in this court on the violation of the obligation of
contracts, it will be found that this case does not come within
the principle of any of those where the decision was, that the
new -lawswere no violation, but, on the contrary, is much like.
several where the decision annulled them as a clear violation.
Thus, where a new law has taken the property of a corporation
f~r highways under the right of eminent domain, which reaches ill property, private or corporate, on a public necessity, and
on making full compensation for it, and under an implied stipulatibn'to be allowed to do it in all public grants and charters, no

by prexistmg laws or rights, and consequently no part of the
obligation of the contract is impaired. See case of the West
River Bridge, and authorities there cited, in 6 Howard, 507
So, when the legislature afterwards tax the property of such
corporations, in common with other property of like kind in the
State, it is under an implied stipulation to that effect, and violates no part of the contract contained in the charter. Armstrong v. Treasurer of Athens County, 16 Peters, 281. See Prov-.
idence Bank v. Billings, 4 Peters, 514, 11 Peters, 567, 4 Wheat.
699, 12 Mass. Rep. 252, 4 Gill & Johns. 132, 4 Durn. & East,
2, 5 Barn. & Ald. 157, 2 Railway Cases, 23.
So, when no clause existed in a charter for a bridge against
authorizing other bridges near at suitable places, it is no violation of'the terms or obligation of the contract to authorize
another. Charles River Bridge v. The Warren Bridge et al., 11
Peters, 420.
Nor is it, if a law make deeds by femes covert good when
bona fide, though not acknowledged in a particular form, because it confirms rather than impairs their deeds, and carries
out the original intent of the parties. Watson v. 'Mercer, 8
Peters, 88.
Or if a State grant lands, but makes no stipulation not to
"legislate further upon the subject, and proceeds to prescribe a
mode or form of settling titles, this does not impair the force of
the. grant, or take away any right under it. Jackson v. Lumpkin, 3 Peters, 280.
Nor does it, if a State merely changes the-remedies in form,
but does not abolish them entirely, or merely changes the
mode of recording deeds, or shortens the statute of limitations. 3 Peters, 280, Hawkins v. Barney's Lessee, 5 ib. 457
It has been held, also, not only that a legislature may regu;
late anew what is merely the remedy, but some State courts
have decided that it may make banking corporations subject to
certain penalties for not performing their duties, -such as paymg their notes on demand in specie, and that this does not
violate any contract. Brown v. Penobscot Bank, 8 Mass. Rep.
445, 2 Hill, 242, 5 Howard, 342. It is supposed to help
enforce, and not impair, what the charter requires. But on
this, being a very different question, we give no opinion.
But look a moment at the other class of decisions. Let a
charter or grant be entirely expunged, as in the case of the
Yazoo claims in Georgia, and no one can doubt that the obligation of the contract is impaired. Fletcher v. Peck, 6

.Or if v.a charter,
deemed private rather than public, has been
altredas to its gpvernment and control. Dartmouth College
v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518.
Or if owners of lands, granted without conditions or restrictions, have been by the legislature deprived of their usual remedy for mesne profits, or compelled to pay for certain kinds of
improvements, for which they were not otherwise liable. Green
v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 1.
Or if, after a mortgage, new laws are passed, prohibiting a
sale to foreclose it, unless two thirds bf its appraised value is
offered, and enacting further that the equitable title shall not
be extinguished till twelve months after the sale. Bronson v.
Kinzie, 1 Howard, 311 ; McCracken v. Hayward, 2 ib. 608.
These last cases in Wheaton and Howard are very near in
point to the present one, .though, in my view, a less strong and
decisive encroachment on a previous contract than this is.
So are the cases very near where all remedy -whateyer is taken away, and it is held that the obligation of the contract. is
thus impaired. See some before citea, and 8 Mass. Rep. 430';

BALDwrn L.T. AL. V.PAYA- ET A
This case involves several of the 'questions just 'discussed -in
that of the Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.
Some of the points of difference are' merely nominal; as,
for instance, that the charter of the Mississippi Railroad Company, which transferred the notes in this case; is different. But,
it being subsequent in date to the charter to the Planters' Bank,
and with " all the usual rights, powers, and privileges of banking
which are permitted to banking. institutions within the State,"
the court seemed, by.mutual consent of parties, to regard those
conferred on the Planters' Bank as extensive as any, and therefore a correct guide here..

JANUARY TERM, -1848.
Baldwin et al. v. Payne' et al.

Other differences may be more material in appearance, as
that the transfer in this case was found by the special verdict
to have been in payment of a debt of the bank; and another,
that the suit here is in the name of the indorsee, and not, as mf
the former case, in the name of the promisee.
Its being assigned in payment of a debt is, however, no
more than was presumed might have been the truth in the
other case. And its being sued in the name either of the indoriee or payee can make little difference on the final construction given by the State court to the prohibitory law in the action of the Planters" Bank v. Sharp et al. That construction,
we have seen, was, that it is the transfer itself which is prohibited and made in some degree penal, rather than the'action in the
name of the indorsee being all which is prohibited. It will be
remembered, also, that if the State might be able, by a general
repealing law, to prevent a suit' in the name of an i.ndorsee,
without impairing any contract in the charter itself, as. is argued for the defence, it could hardly do this without impairing
the other contract, between the bank and the maker, by which
theCertainly
latter promises to pay any indorsee.
the neir prohibitory law, ought 'not to have attempted more than. a repeal of the statute allowing suits by
indorsees of negotiable paper in their own name. Then the
indorsees of notes negotiable, as of notes not negotiable, would
still possess a right to sue their notes in the names of the
payees.
In.such a case, there would be some plausibility in the idea,
that, though the action would not lie in the name of the indorsee, yet if it could in -the name'of the payee, for and on
his-account,.the prohibitory law would chiefly affect the remedy; and not the right of action in some form or other.
But even then, if the obligation or force or duty of the
contracts, whether with the bank by the State, or with the
maker, was iapaired in any degree, though under cover of affecting the remedy only, it would come within the constitutional restriction.
But how much more must it so come in this case, as well-as
the other, where, instead of merely changing the obligation so
as to render a recovery on the contract not permissible in the
name of an assignee, but more inconvenient, expensive, dilatory, and often difficult, in the name of another, the 'payee,
the State court of Mississippi hold, that the legislature, by the
prohibitory law of 1840, not only meant to abate a suit in the
name of an indorsee, but in the name of the payee, if a transfer had once been made. Sub stantially, they consider any suit
on the note, by any body, after it has ofice been tranferred, as

334

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

illegal, and the right to enforce the contract to be lost or forfeited for ever.
This view of the statute of 1840 being regarded as established in Mississippi, renders it clear that in this case, as well
as the case of the Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al., the law under
which this action has been abated must be considered as having impaired the obligation of contracts, and therefore to be
in this respect unconstitutional, and the judgment of the State
court erroneous.
The judgment below, must, therefore, be reversed, and as a
special verdict was found in this case, judgment must be entered on it in favor of the original plaintiffs.

the note between the bank and the paree, it is uncoistitutional. The fair import of the provision takes away only the negotiability. of the instrument. But*the courts of Mississippi
have decided, where a note has been assigned in violation of
the statute, that no suit can be sustained on the note, either in
the name of the assignee or of the payee. This impairs the
obligation of the contract, which the Constitution inhibits.
The argument, that, where the bank attempts to transfer a
note by a void indorsement, it must be reindorsed to enable
the bank to sue in its own name as payee, is unsustainable. A
void indorsement is no indorsement, and it can have no effect
on the validity of the note. The section declares, that "it
shall not be lawful for any bank in this State to transfer, by
indorsement or otherwige, any note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt; and if it shall appear in evidence, upon the
trial of any action upon such note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt, that the same was transferred, the same shall
abate upon the plea of the defendant."
The -object of the statute was to secure the right of the
debtors of a bank to pay their debts in its own paper. This
they could not do, if the notes, before they were payable, had
been assigned by the bank. No fair construction of the seventh
section can authorize a forfeiture of the note, by reason of the
illegal indorsement. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider
whether such a provision would be constitutional.
The bank had the power, under its charter, to assign promissory notes. If this were not so, the law to prohibit the as-

sigument would have been unnecessary. There being noexpress power in the charter of the- bank to indorse notes,
it must be considered as exercising the power.under the general law making notes negotiable.; and in this respect it must
stand on the same ground as an individual. And this presents
the question, whether the repeal of the law making notes ne-gotiable by banks can affect notes executed before the repeal.
A majority of- the judges hold that a provision so construed is
void, as it impairs the obligation of the contract. I dissent
-from this conclusion.
An individual holds a note, which, under the statute, is negotiable ; but the statute is repealed. Does this take away the
negotiability of the noter? I think it -does. There can be no
doubt of this, uhless such a construction shall impair the obligation of the contract. Now, what dbligation is violated by
this constructioit? It is said, that the maker of the note promised to pay to the assignee of the payee. This is admitted.
But until the note be assigned, there can be no assignee. The
indorsement is a new contract between the indors~r and the
indorsee ; and when this contract is made, it can no more be
impaired than the contract between the maker and the pavee
of the note.
A promise to pay to A. B. or his assignee is no contract with
the assignee, until the new contract of asignment be mdde.
The promise is to pay to the indorsee, if the payee of the note
shall indorse it. But the payee, is under no obligation to indorse.the'note. And if there be no obligation, how can it be
impaired ? A contract binds a party either to do or not fo do
a certain thing. The maker of the note, on a certain contingency, binds himself to pay the indorsee, and that contingency
is exdepends upon the will of the payee; but until that will
ercised, there is no obligation by the maker. The payee has
power to bind the maker of the -note to pay its contents to
some other person; but until that power is exercised, there is
no contract which can be impaired.
Suppose a power of dttorneywas given to A by B, to enable him to bind B,'by a written instrument, to do a certain
thing which may legally be done, but, before the instrument
is executed, the thing is made unlawful; does this impair the
obligation of'the contract? " The instrument contemplated has
no existerice; B cannot complain that he has not been bound
to do the act, and on what ground can A complain? Is his
6ontract impaired? He has no contract, He had the powor
to make a contract, which he failed to exercise. And this is
the principle involved in he case now under consideration.
The payee had a discretionary powei to bind the maker of the

336

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

note, but he did not exercise it until the assignment of the note
was made illegal. Is a mere power of attorney to make a
contract within the Constitution ? It is essential, to constitute
a contract, that there shall be two parties bound by it. Now
the payee is not bound to assign the note, though the maker
has authorized him to assign it. This, then, is a mere power
to make a contract, which may or may not, at the discretion
of the payee, be exercised. It is a mere unexecuted power to
make a contract, and is, in my judgment, not within the Constitution.
If the charter of the bank had contained a special provision,
authorizing it to assign promissory notes, no subsequent act of
-the legislature could repeal or modify such provision, against
the consent of the bank.

Mr. Justice DANIEL.
Differing from the majority of the court in the decision just
pronounced, I might, nevertheless, have been disposed to acquiesce in that decision, had it related to questions merely of
property or of individual interests; but,embracing as it does a
construction of the Constitution, and annulling at the same
time a, legislative act of a sovereign State, I cannot feel warranted in yielding by silence a seeming approbation of conclusions which my judgment entirely repels. My deliberate opinion, then, is, that the statute of Mississippi of February 21st,
'1840, by its seventeenth section, comes not in conflict with the
tenth section of the first article of the Constitution; that it in
no wise impairs the obligation of any contract between the
State and the Mississippi Railroad Company, formed by grant
of the charter'of that company, nor as existing with the plaintiffs in eror as claiming under them. An elaborate review of
the arguments on which the pretensions of the plaintiffs in error are urged is not here deemed necessary, nor will I e-ater
much in detail upon the reasons by.which those arguments
appear to be met and overthrown, but-will content myself with
.succinctly stating the .decisive conclusions of, my own mind
upon the only question properly presented by this record, and
the legal grounds on which those conclusions are bottomed.
The rights of the plaintiffs in error, whatever they may be, it
'must be borne in mind, are derived from the charter of the Mississippi Railroad Company, or from that of the Planters' Bank
of Mississippi, as supposed to possess rights and powers more
comprehensive than those vested in the former company; but
from whichsoever of those companies the plaintiffs in error may
choose to deduce their rights, these must- be restricted .to" the
rights and authority vested in the source from which they are

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

337

drawn. Both the Mississiljpi Railroad Company and the Plant-ers' Bank of Mississippi are corporations created by statute, deriving their existence and every power and attribute they ever
possessed from the laws which gave them existence, and from
these only. The doctrine has been long -and repeatedly.affirmed by this court, that; in ifiterpreting the powers and rights of
corporations, an essential distinction must be taken between
corporations existing by the common law (often, nay, necessarily, traceable to a remote and obscure antiquity), and those
which are created by statute, whose constitutions and powers
are defined aud ascertained by accessible and visible .proofs.
Into the composition or practices of the former, tradition, implication, or usage may enter, and thus give room for assumptions of power; with respect to the latter, no such rule, or
rather misrule, .has obtained or been permittedi especially by
the settled decisions of this day. The adjudications of this
court, as has been already stated, are too explicit to admit of
doubt on this subject. Thus, in the case of Head and Amory
v. The Providence Insurance Co., 2 Cranch, 127, Chief Justice Marshall says, -" Without ascribing to this body (the Insurance Company), which in its corporate capacity, is the mere
creature. of the act to which it owes its existence; all the qualities and disabilities annexed by the common law to ancient
institutions of this sort, it may correctly be said to be.precise-ly what the incorporating act has made. it; to derive all its
powers from that act, and to be capable of exerting its'faculties
only in the manner which that act authorizes. To this source
of its being, then, we must recur, to ascertain' its powers, and
to determine whether it can complete a contract by such commumications as are in this record."
In the case of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, "4Wheat.
636, it is said by the court, that "a corporation is an artificial
being, invisible, intangible, and existing only in coitemplation
of law. Being a mere creature of the law., it possesses only
those properties which the charter.of its "cieation confers upon
it, either expressly.or as incidental to its very eaistece." In
the case of The Bank v. Dandridge, 12 Wheat. 64, this court
said, -5' Whatever may.be the implied powers of aggregate corporations at the common law, and the modes by which those
powers are to be carried-into operation, corporations created
by statute must depend, both for their powers and the mode
of exercising them, upon the true construction of the statute
itself." In the case of The Bank'of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Peters,
587, -the several authorities just mentioned are cited in the
-opinion of the court; all of them approved, and none of them,

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

it is presumed, will be questioned as not laying down. the law
with perfect accuracy.
-Such being the well-settled rule of this court with respect
to statutory corporations, let us inquire into its operation on
the case before us. Neither by the charter granted to the Mississippi Railroad Company, or to the Planters' Bank of Mississippi, nor to any other banking corporation within the State,
was the power ever directly given to assign bonds, bills, or
promissory notes. Is this power necessarily implied in any of
the express grants contained in the -charters now under consideration ? It is admitted on all sides that the clause in this
charter of -the Planters' Bank which authorizes the bank to
discount bills of exchange and notes, and to make loans, contains no such direct grant.; but it is said that the bank is
authorized to possess and receive lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and effects, td a certain amount,
and to grant, demise, alien, or dispose of the same for -the good
of the bank; and that this authority confers the power of
assigning notes discounted by the corporation. Could the
doctrine of implied powers, in contravention of the express decisions of this court just cited, be extended in its-utmost latitude to these statutory corporations, still it would seem difficult,
even by the greatest violence of construction, to torture the
language of this charter into an expression of the meaning
here ascribed to-it.

The right to acquire.and to dispose of"

effects cannot, by the natural import of lInguage, nor by any
received intendment, be made to signify the power to discount
bills and notes; much less can it be interpreted to mean the
power to transfer bills and notes discounted, or securities of
any description, and beyond this even, the power (in opposition
to the principles of the common law in reference to choses in
action) of inveting the assignee with thd right of maintaining
an action at law in his own name. The extravagance of the
construction contended for on behalf of the plaintiffs may be
seen by bringing it to another test, Let it be supposed that
the charters of these comVnias contained not one word about
rights and powers of banicing, as -then permitted to other corporations in the State of Mississippi; suppose., too, they had
been silent as to any right to discount bills and notes, and had
been limited to the simple power of receiving and possessing
goods, chattels, and effects, and of disposing of such effects for
the good of the bank; 'vould it be pretended that, under this
latter provision, the power of discounting bills or notes, or of
discounting at all, was given by the mere import of the word
eifects, -

that the power of receiving and disposing of effects

meant the power of discounting bills and notes?

This can

339

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

hardly be pretended. If, then, this term be not synonymous
with the words bills and notes when taken in connection with
the power of discounting and of making loans, how can it become so by being connected with the right of acquisition and
enjoyment, or with the jus disponendi? The power to sell or
assign discounted notes cannot be deduced from the clause in
the charter which authorizes the exercise of the usual banking
powers granted to the banks of Mississippi, first, because in
no charter granted by the State is it shown that such a right
is expressly conferred; secondly, it is manifest that a traffic in
the sale of its own paper, or in notes or bills discounted, is conformable neither with the regular functions of 'a bank, nor reconcilable vith the purposes of its institution. Banks are
usually created for the purpose of making loans, and this in a
medium, in theury at least, equal to money; not for the purpose of borrowing, or of raising means to eke out their daily
existence by selling off their securities or their own paper.
Their establishment rests upon the idea of their possessing
funds of their own as the foundation of their credit and of
their circulation. The practice of beconiing brokers for the
sale of their own paper or the paper of their customers,. t" put
themselves in funds, is not, therefore, one of their regular functions, and can flow only from an abuse of these functions, and
is a perversion-of the legitimate ends of their creation. So,
too, it is entirely inadmissible to place this practice of brokerage by the bank upon the mere absence of an inhibition in the
charter; such a mode. of reasoning cuts up entirely the admission, that the banks have no power except such as is expressly
granted or necessarily implied. The fallacy of the idea, that
.he right to dispose of effects conferred by the charter of the
Planters' Bank implied the right of*an habitual and unrestricted sale or 'brokerage of discounted notes, is exposed by adverting to another provision of the charter, by which the' amount
of effects of every kind which the bank .was permitted to
acquire and dispose of was positively limited to a specified
amount. The power of the bank being thus restricted, that
power could by no sound reasoning be made coincident or coextensive with regular and permanent operations on thC part.
of this corporation; for if its banking powers were deducible from such a limited privilege, or were dependent upori it,
of course, when this permitted limit should be attained, the
operations of the bank would be at an end. It is clear,-therefore, that these corporations, restricted as are all statutory corporations under the decisions of this court, to the express grants
contained in their charters, and to implications necessary to
and inseparable from those grants, never were by the provisions

340

-SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

of their charters invested with the power to assign bills or
notes, and. much less by such assignment to invest their assignee with the right of suing at law; that whatever power of
assignment these corporations at any time may have -possessed,
and-whatever the effert implied in such assignment, both were
conferred upon them in common with all other persons, natural
or artificial, within the State, by a general public law, subject
at all times to modification or repeal by the authority which
enacted it. Vid. section 12 of the statute, Howard and Hutchinson's Laws of Mississippi, p. 373.
The actual repeal of such a statute cannot correctly be regarded as the violation of any vested right, or the impairing
of the obligation of a contract, for no one can claim to have a
perfect and vested right, through all future time, in the mere
cayacity to do an act, frofni the absence of a law forbidding
that act. A pretension like this would forestall and prevent
legislation upon every subject. A wholly different state of
things would have existed had the assignment to the plaintiffs
been made anterior to the repeal of the statute, for then the
-rights of these parties would have been vested and complete;
but the assignment was in this instance sibsequent, by more
than a year, to the passage of the repealing statute, was a new
and separate contract, and entered into with necessary knowledge of its provisions, and made apparently in defiance thereof.
This view of the question is clearly and forcibly presented by
the Supreme Court of Louisiana, in the case of.Hyde and
another, v. The Planters' Bank of Mississippi, 8 Robinson,
416, a case arising upon the laws and charters now under consideration, and in all its features essentially, nay, mutato nomine, literally, the same with the present. It has been said, that,
in the case from 8 Robinson, the note was made after the
enactment of the repealing statute. I think that this statement
is not warranted by the statement of facts in that case. Certainly the reasoning of the court rests on no such hypothesis,
for it covers the whole of the language and policy of the
statute of Mississippi, and vindicates them 'to the utmost extent. ih this case, the note was assigned- after the enactment
of the repealing law, and with full knowledge thereof, and the
assignment wis an independent and posterior contract which
the law had forbidden. The question, then, as to the validity
of the statute of Misissippi seems to resolve .itself into this
inquiry, - whether a sovereign State of this Union-possesses the
right within her own territory to regulate the formation of contracts, to define the rights and interests such contracts shall
*give to the parties thereto, and to declare the modes and extent
in and to which these may be enforced by her.own tribunals.

JANUARY TERM, 1848.

341

Planters' Bank v. Sharp et al.

To such an inquiry I can give none but an aflrmative answer;
and any other, I feel assured, is not evoked either by the language or spirit of the Federal Constitution, and would be highly unjust and inconvenient with respect to the States.
With regard to the plaintiffs in error, no injustice nor hard-,
ship of any kind is perceived in enforcing a hinst them the
provisions of the statute of 1840. In the first place, they
have, with full knowledge of the law, placed themselves directly in the attitude of resistance thereto; for they have entered, into an agreement explicitly inhibited upon grounds of
public policy, and this long. after such inhibition was proclaimed to'every person within the State. In the next place,
there surely can be no merit in a combination, the effects and
manifest purposes of which were to deny to the holders of the
notes of these banking corporations the power of making
payment to them in their own currency, and" to enable the.
latter to seize or to appropriate to themselves or their favorites.
the substance of those very note-holders'to whom such right
of payment was denied. A proceeding thus subversive of
justice has not been heretofore sanctioned by this ourt, and in
one instance has been, to a certain extent, - indeed, as I think,
to the whole length of the present case, - directly condemned.
The case of the United States v. Robertson, 5 Peters, 641, was
a case in ivhich a judgment had been recovered by the United
States against the Bank of Somerset for an amount.of money
which had been deposited by a collector-in that bank. By.an
act-of Congress of the year 1818, it was provided, .that, in any
suit thereafter instituted by the United States against any corporate body for the recovery of money upon any bill, note, or
other security, it should be lawful to summon as garnishees
the debtors of such corporation, who were required to state on
oath the amount in which they stood indebted at the time of
serving such summons, for which amount judgment should be
entered in favor of the United States, in the same manner as
if it had been due and owing to the United States. ' On the
9th of February, 1819, a year after the act of Congress giving
the remedy by attachment to the United States, the legislature of Maryland passed an act-declaring that, in payment of
any debt due to or judgment obtained -by a bank within that
State, the notes of such bank should be received. Attachments
were laid in behalf of the United States, after their judgment
against tlie-Bank of Somerset, on'debts in the hands of various
debtors to the bank, and on some of thase attachments judgments
had been obtained. It was cont.nded in behalf of these garnishees, that they had a right to discharge their debts in the
notes of the Bank of Somerset, as- well in those cases in
2*

342

SUPREME COURT.
Planters' Bank r. Sharp et al.

which-judgment had been obtained on attachment by the
United States as in those wherein there were no judgments.
Upon this question Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the
opinion of the court (p. 659), remarks, first, upon the act of Congress of i818, - That it operates a transfer from the bank to
the United States of those debts which might be due from the
persons who should be summoned as garnishees. They become, by the service of the summons, debtors of the United
States, and cease to be debtors of the bank. But they owed
-to the United States precisely what they owed to the bank,
and no more "; 2. "That the act of the legislature of Maryland
of 1819, so far as respects debts on which judgments have not
been obtained, embodies the general and-just principles respecting effects, which 'are of common application. Every'debtor
may pay his creditor with the notes of that creditor. They
are an equitable and legal tender. So far as these notes were
in: p6ssession of the debtor at the time he was summoned as
garnishee, they form a counter claim, which diminishes the
debt due to the bank to the extent of that counter claim. But
the residue becomes a debt to the United States, for which
judgment is to be -rendered. May this judgment be discharged
by the paper of the bank? On this subject the court are divided. Three of the judges are pf opinion, that, by the nature
of the contract, and by the operation of the act of Maryland
upon it, an original' right existed to discharge the debt in the
notes of the bank, which original right remains in fuIr force
against the United States, who come in as assignees in law,
and not in fact, and who must therefore stand in the place of
the bank. Three of the judges are of opinion, that the right
to pay the debt in- the notes of the bank does not enter into
the contract." May not this decision, I inquire, be considered
as substantially covering the whole ground of the case before
.us ? For, after stating that the garnishees became by the service of the summons the debtors of the United States, and
,ceased to be the debtors of the bank, it goes on to declare,
that they owed to the United States'what they owed the bank,
and nothing more; that, by the just and general principles of
set-off, every debtor may pay his creditor with the notes of that
creditor, whidh as to him are an equitable and legal tender.
And by the unanimous declaration of the court, not until after
the claim against the garnishee was carried 'into a judgment,
and after the allowance-of all rights of tender and set-off in
the notes of the bank, could payment be coerced from him in
any other medium than the notes of the bank. One half the
court deemed the garnishee, even after judgment, entitled to the
same privileges against the creditor of the bank which he pos-

sessed against the bank itself. This right, as between note-holders and the assignees of a failing or insolvent bank, is fully sustained by the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the case of The
Union Bank of Tennessee v. Ellicot, Morris,. & Gill, 6 Gill &
Johns. 364, and in that of The Bank of Maryland v.Ruff, 7 ib.
448, in which last case the authority of this court is relied on.
But, at all events, the principles of these decisions are broad
enough to vindicate the legislation of .Mississippi, and the objects of that legislation, against the imputation of oppression or
hardship as respects these plaintiffs, and all who may occupy a
similar position, if legislation can need vindication or apology,
the purposes of which are to prevent, if possible, the paper of
-these corporations, sbread over the community by them, from
utterly perishing on th6'hands of the note-holder, and to disappoint dishonest cdmbinations to set the public laws at defiance, and, further, to oppress and ruin the note-holder by taking
his property, and leaving him the worthless and false and simulated representatives of, an equivalent. I am of the opinion,
that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi should
in both these cases be affirmed.

fire in Long Island Sound.

THiS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the District of Rhode Island, in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction.
In February, 1839, the State of New Jersey chartered a

Company, with a capital of five hundred thousand dollars, for
the purpose of purchasing, building, repairing and altering any
vessel or vessels propelled by steam, and in the navigation of
the same, &c., &c., under which charter they became propnetors of the steamboat Lexington.
On the 1st of August, 1839, the following agreement was
