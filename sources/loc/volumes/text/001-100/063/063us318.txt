West died before .the claim was acted upon by the United
States commissioners.
We have only to observe, that the fraudulent attempts to
enlarge the grant were made after California had been ceded
to the United States; and though the proof of it is undeniable,
and was an attempt to defraud the United States, that cannot
take away. from the wife and children of West their claim to
the grant, which was made to him before California had been
transferred by treaty.
We affirm the decree of the court, below, conf rming the

The Real Estate Bank of Arkansas was establiahed on a loan by the State of
Arkansas of its bonds, which the bank'sold to form its capitaL The stockholders gave their bonds and mortgaged their lands to the extent of their
subscriptions. Notrebe subscribed tor three hundred shares, and mortgaged
his land for thirty thousand dollars.
Notrebe sold the land with a covenant of warranty, and then died. The purchaser paid all the money, and the widow and heir at law of Notrebe offered
to convey the land by a deed, with a covenant of warranty of title.
The Circuit Court, sitting as a court of equity, decreed that the executors should
remove the encumbrance whenever it could be done, and in the mean time
they should deposit with the clerk of the court bonds of the State of Arkansa
to an amount sufficient to pay Notrebe's subscription, with interest in case the
bank should prove a total loss.
This decree was erroneous.
The purchaser must rely upon his remedy at law under the covenant of'urranty.
He can either take the deed offered by the widow and heir at la%7, or retain
the original agreement.
The caes examined upon the poiun, how far a court of chancery ill interfere in
such a case.

BRefdd d al. v. Woodfoik.

The case is fully stated in the opinion of the court.
It was submitted upop printed arguments by Mr. Pike for
the appellants, and Mr. Megs for the appellee.
The arguments upon both sides took a wide range, and
included many points which would have been applicable, if a
suit had been brought at law upon the covenant of warranty,
such as that there could be no recovery, except for nominal
damages, until the vendee was evicted. With respect to the
interposition of a court of equity in a case situated like the
present, Mr. Pike said:

The chief question in this case is a perfectly simple one.
Woodfolk proposed to purchase certain land of Notrebe; he
was informed that it was mortgaged to the Real Estate Bank,
which was insolvent. The mortgage was of record; and the
charter of the bank, showing the liability under the mortgage,
was a public law of the land. It was totally uncertain what
would be the ultimate liability under the mortgage. It was
meant to cover the share of Notrebe and Cummins in any
deficit of the assets of the bank. Whether there would be
any deficit or not was not known. Notrebe told Woodfolk
all he knew about it; that the bank attorney thought there
would not. All the sources and means of information on that
subject were as open to Woodfolk as Notrebe; and knowing,
or having the means of knowing, all that anybody could know,
he purchased the land at the low price of $10.50 per acre, and
took a bond from Notrebe, to make him "a good and sufficient
conveyance in fee simple, with covenant of warranty."
Can he, after occupying the land several years, and paying up
the purchase money, when it is still as uncertain as ever, what,
if any, will be the ultimate liability under the stock mortgage,
claim at the hands of a court of equity that it shall compel
INotrebe's heirs to indemnify him against such contingent
liability? Or will it not be held that he made a chancing
bargain, an aleatory contract, getting the land at the price he
did on account of the contingent encumbrance upon it, and

SUPREME COURT.

taking the risk of that encumbrance? That is the whole question.
(Mr. Pike then proceeded to argue that the words of the
covenant did not bind Notrebe to make a conveyance with a
covenant against encumbrances.)
The quia timejurisdiction of the court of equity is one which
the court has often exercised; but it will be extremely tender
in so doing, because it materially varies the agreement of the
parties at the time of the transaction.
Flight v. Cook 2 Ves. Sen., 620
And the doctrine seems to be well settled, that where a deed
has been executed, and the only covenants in it are for quiet
enjoyment or of warranty, and so long as there has been no
eviction, actual or constructive, equity will, as a general rule,
refuse to entertain a bill for relief, either by way of enjoining
the purchase money, or, a forieri, by rescinding the contract;
and, although it has been at times initimated that the presence
of a covenant for seizin may in some cases fortify the position
of the purchaser, it does not appear that the cases generally
draw much distinction between the different covenants for
title.
Rawle on Coy. for Title 679, and the many cases cited.
If this contract is still executory, then in that case, as a
general rule, the purchaser ia entitled to a good title, free of
encumbrances. He cannot be forced specifically to perform,
unless such title can be made. If sued for the purchase money,
he may enjoin its collection, or compel the removal of encumbrances. That is the general rule. But the question here is,
what relief has he in equity, if, making the bargain, knowing
of an 'encumbrance, he pays up the purchase money without
requiring it to be removed, and when it is of the nature of the
one here complained of?
It is not a question here, whether he could be compelled td
perform his contract. He has performed it; he is in possession; has used the land and enjoyed its issues now for nearly
ten years. He does not offer to give it up. He protests
against doing so. If he had all the covenants lie could possibly demand, there has been o breach of any of them that

would entitle him to damages; and therefore he would be
entitled to recover only nominal damages at law, and would
have no relief in equity; that is too clear to be denied.
Rawle, 680. How can he be 4ontitled to any more relief,
because he has not yet taken a deed? He has the same
covenants he would have in a deed, and they are as efhectual to
protect him. The difference between a contract executory and
one executed by deed is, that in case of the latter, if he had no
covenants, he would have no remedy; and if he had them, he
must look to them. In the former case, he might resist a demand
of performance, and object to taking the property or to paying
the price; but when he has paid, and is in possession, it makes
no difference whether the contract is executed or executory.
Having chosen to perform, all he is entitled to is his convey.
ance. If he could defend at law against payment of the pur
chase money, wholly or in part, he might have relief in
equity; but he cannot be sued for what he has paid.
In Anon, 2 Freem., 106, a case was cited "where a purchaser brought his bill to be relieved where encumbrances
were concealed; but was dismissed; for he ought to have
provided against it by covenants; but it was said by Rawlinson, that if the purchaser had in that case had his money in
his hand, this court would have helped him, but not after he
had paid his money."
Again: We have sought in vain for a case where a bill,
asking indemnity alone, has been sustained, or even heard of,
filed by a purchaser when that indemnity was sought against
an encumbrance by .ortgage, well known to the purchaser
at and before the time of purchase, and where he had fully
paid the pu:chase money without requiring indemnity or complaining of the encumbrance.
It is a mere attempt "to amend the plaintiff's security in
equity; to give him a better remedy for his money in chancery than he bad provided for himself by the condition of the
bond which he took." There was no fraud in Notrebe; he
told Woodfolk all that he himself knew about the encumbrance. Voodfolk made the purchase and took the bond
with his eyes open. That he has come to think the encum.

brance more serious than h'e imagined, is no reason why a
court of equity should mend or increase his security; that is
not its province. The heir of Notrebe is in no default; being
a minor, she could not convey. The bill is a plain attempt to
get the court of chancery to mend Woodfolk's bargain and
we see no better ground to assign for the application, than
"that chancery ought to suffer no man to have an ill bargain."
A bill filed for compensation singly cannot be maintalned,
NTwham v. May, 13 Price, 749.
The jurisdiction of equity in cases of compensation is only
incidental and ancillary to that of giving relief by enforcing
the performance of contracts for the sale of real property. Id.
The court will give it when title to a part of the property
fails, and it decrees that the purchaser shall accept, or he
agrees to accept, that to which there is good title.
Besant v. Richards, 1.Taml., 509.
Pratt v. Law, 9 Cranch, 458, &c.
And there is certainly no ground on which to decree an
indemnity against an encumbrance that was known to the
purchaser when he made his contract, and to protect himself
against which, he asked no provision to be put into the contract. The court will not insert that provision, when he himself did "notthink it worth his while to do so. He made his
contract as he pleased, and must be content with it. If he
had not known of the encumbrance, the case would be very
different.
Mr. Meigs said that the presbnt bill was filed to have a
specific performance of Notrebe's covenant to make the complainant a good and suffi~ient conveyance in fee simple, if
Notrebe's heirs can perform it, and if they cannot, that what
title they have may be divested out of them, and vested in
complainant, with indemnity against the mortgage.
.. Medgs then cited a number of cases in illustration of
these principles, and then proceeded to consider the interference of a court of equity.
It is familiar law, that the general principles of the contract

enforce, while it is still executory, as in this case, the right of
the purchaser to a title clear of defects and encumbrances.
Rawle on Covenants, 566.
Burwell v. Jackson; supra.
But, practically, bow is this to be done, in a case circumstanced as the one in hand? Before the payment of the -urchase money, we have seen that it can be done by an abatement of the purchase money to an amount equal to the cost
of removing the encumbrance. And the vendor must discharge an encumbrance, not disclosed to the vendee, whether
he has or has not agreed to covenant against encumbrances,
before he can compel the payment of the purchase money.
Sugdeb, chap. 12, see. 2, par. 2.
Although the purchase money has been paid, and the conveyance is executed, yet if the defect do not appear on the
face of thp title deeds, and the vendor was aware of the defect,
and concealed it from the purchaser, or suppressed the instrument by'which the encumbrance was created, or on the face
of which it appeared, he is, in every such case, guilty of a
fraud; and the purchaser may either bring his action on the
case, or file his bill in equity.
Sugden, chap. 12, sec. 2, par. 17.
In Sergeant Maynard's case, he was denied relief, because
he had parted with his inoney, and taken a bond for repayment of it, on a certain condition.
2 Freeman's Rep., 2.
In our case, Woodfolk took a bond to make him a good
and sufficient conveyance in fee, and then paid the purchase
money. And afterwards he discovers that.the land is encumbered for more than its entire value, the encumbrance having
been represented to-him as of no.validity or force, and its true
nature sedulously concealed, and the deed not even shown.
Tow, in these cifcumstances, he is entitled, unquestionably,
to a conveyance of the fee simple that shall be effectual. 'Will
the court content itself by simply decreeing that a deed shall
be made, formally conveying* the fee, but leaving the land
under the burden of the encumbrance; or divesting what title
there is in Notrebe's heir, and vesting it in Woodfolk?

SUPREME COURT.
Refeld el al. v. Woodfolc.

If the court be of opinion that Woodfolk is entitled to "an
operative conveyance, one that carries with it a good and
sufficient title to the land conveyed," as Kent said in Clute v.
Robinson, 2 Johns. R., 612, already cited, there seems to be
no practical way of effecting this, but by compelling ETotrebe's
heir and representatives to extinguish the mortgage, or to bry
so many State bonds as shall lie equal to the stock bond.
It iAplain that the heir of Notrebe cannot make a good and
sufficient conveyance in fee simple, without, in some way
releasing the estate from the mortgage; and it is equally plain
that there is no way of releasing the estate from the mortgage
but by paying a sum of the State bonds equal to the stock.
And Woodfolk might insist upon this; but if he is willing to
take such title as can be decreed out of the heir, with an indemnity against the mortgage, that is a relief which is within
the power of a court of chancery. The subject will be found
pretty fully discussed in Sugden oft Vendors and Purchasers,
chap. 10, *sec. 2. And the weight of the cases there stated
and commented on cannot certainly be regarded as weakened
in the least by what is reported to have been said by Lord
Eldon in Balmorno v. Lumley, 1 Ves. and Beam., 225, cited
by Sugden in chap. 7, sec. 2, par. 36. The case, when examined, cannot possibly have the slightest weight, seeing that it
is reported in so crude a manner as to leave us wholly in the
dark as to its circumstances.
The indemnity which the heir of Notrebe seems bound to
make will be, as already suggestea, the substitution of another estate instead of the land sold to Woodfolk, to be held
by a trustee, to save him harmless against the mortgage.
When we ask this, we only ask that Notrebe's heir shall
assume the burden of Notrebe's debt, and relieve the complainant against liability for it-a liability which, in his opinion, is not merely visionary, but is extremely likely to em.
b~arrass and harass him in 1861, only a year hence.

Refeld et al. v. Woodfolk.

Mr. Justice CAMPBELL delivered the opinion of the court.
The appellee (Woodfolk) filed this bill in the Circuit Court
against the executors and heirs of Frederick Notrebe, doceased,
and the trustees of the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas.
He represents that, in 1845, he concluded an agreement
with Notrebe for the purchase of fourteen hundred and
seventy-eight acres of unimproved, land in Arkansas, for
fifteen thousand five hundred and eighteen dollars, a portion
payable in cash, and the remainder in instalments, secured by
his notes and bond. Kotrebe and his wife obligated themselves, when the payment should be completpd, to convey to
him the land i~n fee simple, "by a good and sufficient deed,
with general warranty of title, duly executed, according to
law."
The appellee has established a plantation upon the land,
and has greatly improved its value. He completed the payment in 1850, when the executor of Notrebe offered a deed
executed by his widow and heir-at-law, in which there was a
covenant of warranty, in fulfilment of the agreement of his
testator. The appellee declined to accept this, because the
land had been mortgaged to the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas,
in 1837, by K~otrebe, to secure the payment of his note for
thirty thousand dollars, payable in October, 1861, with five
per cent. interest annually, which Notrebe had given for three
hundred shares of the stock of that bank. The appellee
charges that the existence of this mortgage was concealed
from him ufitil after the conclusion of his agreement, and that
afterwards he was deceived by misrepresentations of.the'condition of the title, until he had paid the whole of the purcbase
money. He prays that the title be examined, and that the
defendants be required to remove the encumbrance, or to give
him effectual indemnity against it, and that the distribution
of the estate of Notrebe be restrained until this be done.
The defendants answered the bill, and have successfully
repelled the imputations -of fraud and misrepresentation, but
admit the existence of the mortgage, and fail to impair its
validity.
The Circuit Court, upon the pleadings and proofs, declare

SUPREME COURT.
Refedd d al.v. Woodfolk.

that the "entire transaction" between Notrebe and the appellee "was bona fide and free from fraud," and that the
latter had notice of the mortgage as a subsisting and operative
encumbrance upon the land before he concluded his contract;
but that Notrebe had agreed to convey the land free of encumbrance and with warranty of title, and that the vendee is
entitled to the performance of that contract; but that the debt
of the decedent, not being at maturity, and of a character not
to be ascertained before that time, all thbt could be done
would be to provide an indemnity against the peril it created.
The court proceed to require of the executors to remove the
encumbrance whenever it can be done, and then to convey the
land by.a deed with warranty, and with the relinquishment
of dower by the widow; and, meanwhile, that they should
deposit with the clerk of the court bonds of the State of
Arkansas, for the amount of Notrebe's note and the interest,
(861,600,) to be held and appropriated under the order of the
court as indemnity, or that the executors might, in part or for
the whole, convey to the clerk unencumbered real estate of
the same value, for the same object and under the same conditions.
The Real Estate Bank was established on z loan by the
State of Arkansas of its bonds, which the bank sold to form
t capital. The principal and interest of these bonds were to
be paid by the bank; and its means of doing so were afforded
by the securities obtained from the loan of its capital and
profits of business, and the bonds and mortgages of the stockholders, to the extent of their subscription of stock Each
stockholder having given a bond and niortgage to the bank
corresponding to the pro rata amount of the State bonds isk aed
to the bank, as compared with the stock and which ivere
pledged for the payment of the State bonds, the sum to be
paid by any shareholder on this debt depends upon the degree
of the insolvency of the bank.. In case 6f the loss of its entire
capital, the stockholder becomes liable to pay his entire debt.
The pleadings and proofs in this case show that the bank
has suffered a loss of a portion of its capital, but no data are
fforded to ascertain the amount of the loss. The decree of

DECEMBER TERM, 1859.

BSZd et al. v. Woodfolk.

the Circuit Court assumes that the loss may be total; and the
indemnity awarded was determined as if the fact would cor o
respond with the possibility. This appeal was made to test
the validity of this decree.
A court of chancery regards the bransfer of real property in
a contract of sale and the payment of the price as correlative
obligations. The one, is the consideration of the other; and
the one failing, leaves the other without a cause. In Ogilvie
v. Foljambe, (8 Mer., 53,) Sir William Grant says: "The
right to a good title is a right not growing out of the agreement of the parties, but which is given by law. The purchaser insists on having a good title, not because it is stipulated for by agreement, but pn the general right of a purchaser
to require it."
Upon this principle, a vendor is allowed a lien or privilege
for the price of the property against the vendee and his assigns; and the vendee is permitted to appropriate the purchase money, to. exonerate his estate from a lien or encumbrance, and in some cases to compensate for original defects
in the estate, as respect its quantity, quality, or extent of
vendor's interest therein.
The cases cited on the part of the appellee support this doctrine, and confirm the argument that he was entitled, under
his contract, (having no reference to extrinsic circumstances,)
to the fee simple estate, without diminution. Galloway v.
Findley, 12 Pet., 264; Burwell v. Jacks6n, 5 Seld., 535; Cullum v. Bank of Ala., 4. Ala. R., 21.
But such circumstances may very materiaty modify the situation of the parties, and indispose that court to interfere between them, even in cases within the jurisdiction of the court.
If the contract has been executed by the delivery of-possession
and the payment of the price, the grounds of interference are
limited by the covenants of the deed, or to cases of fraud and
misrepresefitation. "The cases will show," say this court.
"that a purchaser in the undisturbed possession of the land
will not be relieved against the payment of the purchase
money on the mere ground of defect of title, there being no
raud or misrepresentation; .and that in such a case he must

SUPREME COURT.

seek his remedy at law, on the covenants in his deed; that if
there is no fraud and no covenants to secure the title, he is
without remedy, as the vendor, selling in good faith, is not
responsible for the goodness of his title beyond the extent of
the covenants in his deed. Patton v. Taylor, 7 How., 132.
This rule, experience has shown, reconciles the claims of
convenience with the duties of good faith. The purchaser is
stimulated to employ vigilance and care in reference to the
things as to which they will secure him from injustice, while
it affords no shelter for -bad faith on either part.
The intermediate cases-those in which the parties have advanuced in the completion of their contract, and are still willing to abide by it, and there arises a real inability or a wellfounded apprehension of danger, in that stage of their proceedings, to the completion of the contract-have created
much embarrassment. Some of these cases have been settled
upon terms of compensation, in -which the court of chancery
has exercised a doubtful jurisdiction, in modifying the conditions of the contracf according to the supervening circumstances. White v. Cuddon, 8 Cl. and Fin., 766; Thomas v.
Dering, 1 Keen, 729; Dart, Vend. and P., 499, et seq.
We have met with no case in -which a vendee, in possession
under a contract of purchase or a deed with covenants, has
been permitted to reclaim the purchase money already paid,
to be held as a security for the completion or protection of his
title. The Roman law permitted the vendee to retain the purchuse money in his hands, aw security against an impending
danger to the title; but denied a suit for restitution, after payment, for that cause. "We must not," says Troplong, "hastily break up a contract which the vendor may at last be able
to fulfil. There is no analogy between the case in which the
purchaser is allowed to retain the price as security, and that
in which he would force the vendee to restore it for that purpose. Between the right of retention and that of restitution
of the price, there is the distance between the statu quo and
rescission. Trop. de Vente, No. 614; Dalloz Juris., gen. tit.
4a Vente, sec. 11T0.
The decree of the Circuit Court does not direct the restitu-

tion of the purchase money to the vendee, nor its application
by the vendor to assure the attainment of the object of the
contract; but it sequestrates property of the vendor of four
times the amount, to be held or disposed of by the court in its
discretion, to assure the accomplishment of that object. In
the case of Milligan v. Cooke, 16 Vesoy, 1-14, Lord Eldon
made an order that the purchaser should be compensated for
the difference in the value between the title contracted for
and that exhibited; and if that diterence could not be ascertained, the master was directed to settle the security to be
given by the defendant as indemnity to the purchaser against
disturbance or eviction; and a similar order was made in
Walker v. Barnes, 3 Mad., 247. But there were conditions in
the contract that authorized the order.
In Balmorno v. Lumley, 1 V. and B., 224, and Paton v.
Brebner, 1 Bligh. P. C., 42, the cases in which such a relief
could be granted appear to be limited to that class. In the
latter case Lord Eldon said: "This suit is in substance or
effect (allowing for dissimilarities between English and Scotch
proceedings) in the nature of a suit in a court of equity in
England for the specific performance of a contract. In such a
suit, if it turns out that the defendant cannot make a title to
that which he has agreed to convey, the court will not compel
him to convey less, with indemnity against the risk of eviction. The purchaser is left to seek his remedy at law, in
damages for the breach of the agreement."
In Aylett v. Ashton, 1 M. and C., 309, the master of the
rolls, upon the authority of the cases cited, said: "Parties no
doubt may contract for a covenant of indemnity; but if they
do not, the court cannot compel a party to execute a covvey
ance and to give an indemnity." To the same effect is Ridg
way v. Gray, 1 Mac. and G., 109.
The appellee does not seek to rescind this contract; noi
does he disclose any imminent peril of disturbance or eviction,
as the effect of the existence of the mortgage. The record
shows that the widow and heir of 1Notrebe, whose covenant of
warranty has been offered to the appellee, are either of them
•,nle to respond to the damages tlut would be awarded upon

Ward v. 27wp=&a
the breach of that covenant. The appellee had notice of thia
encumbrance when he made and performed his agreement of
purchase, and did not stipulate for any additional indemnity
to that resulting from the covenant of warranty. We must
therefore conclude that he was willing to abide the settlement
of the aftkirs of the Real Estate Bank, and to rely upon the
protection afforded by the covenants in his deed. We have
no reason to suppose that the vendo would have consented to
deposit in the hands of a stranger four times the value of the
property he sold, as a security for the fulfilment of his con-tract; nor can, we superadd this to the other 'obligations he
has assumed.
Our 6piuion is, that the decree of the District Court is
erroneous, and must.be reversec.
The deeds tendered seem to be in conformity with the stipulation of the vendor in the agreement. Thevendee may elect
to take these, or he may retain the agreement. In either case,
his bill will be dismissed with costs; and for this purpose the
* cause is remanded.
