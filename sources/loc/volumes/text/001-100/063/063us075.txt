EL

& MORRILL, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. JOHN COKE AND
CARLOS J. Co1.

Although under a power of attorney, authorizing a conveyance of lands, the
legal title does not pass when the attorney executes a deed, unless the sale was
made in accordance with the requirements of the power, yet in this case, where
the deed executed by the attorney was apparently vithin the scope of his power,
and admitted the payment of the consideration, it was prima face evidence
of the conveyance of the legal title.
The evidence offered to show that the power of attorney had not been complied
with, was not sufficient in an action of ejectment to recover, the lands after a
long period of time had elapsed, and the lands had been repeatedly sold.

THIS case was brought up by writ of error from the Circuit
Court of the United States for the nbrthern district of Elinois.
It was -n ejectment, brought by Morrill, a citizen of New
Hampshire, to recover from John Cone and Carlos J. Cone
the southwest quarter of section thirty-six, township eleven
north, range one west, in the county of Warren, and State
of Illinois.
Upon the trial, the plaintiff exhibited his title as follows,
viz:
1. A patent for the land in question from the United States
to Benjamin Abbott, dated April 9th, 1818.
2. A deed for said land from said Abbott to the plaintiff,
dated January 9th, 1855.
3. The plaintiff also put in evidence, by way of precaution,
a deed to himself from one Nathaniel Abbott, dated October
26th, 1838.
The defendants, in order to show that the title had passed
out of the Abbotts to grantees, under whom they made de.
fence, at a time prior to the inception of the plaintiff's title,
read to the jury-

TO'

SUPREME COURT.
Morrill v. Cone et al.

1. A deed for said land from Benjamin Abbott to Nathaniel
Abbott, dated May 9th, 1818.
2. A power of attorney from Nathaniel Abbott, John D.
Abbott, and Joseph Low, to Abraham Beck, dafed July 14th,
1820, authorizing him to sell and convey "all those certain
lots, pieces, or parcels of land named and described in the
annexed list or.schedule, situate, lying, and being in the tract
appropriated by acts of Congress for military bounties, in the
State of Illino;:, and which were severally granted to the persons whose names are annexed to each lot or parcel of land,"
with this proviso written immediately after the attesting
clause, "provided, however, that the condition is understood
to be subli, that our said attorney is to take sufficient security
on real estate for all the above lands which may be sold on a
credit."
The annexed schedule contained sixty-four quarter sections,
and among them the land in suit. Acknowledged February
12th, 1821, and recorded July 30th, 1821.
As the decision of the case turned upon the executinn of
this power, and the admissibility of the evidence offered to
prove its defective execution, it is proper to state the circinmstances under which it was given; and, in doing so, to use
the testimony of the witness who was produced, because the
second branch of the opinion of this court is, that even if
the evidence was admissible, it would not have destroyed the
title of the defendants.
In 1820, Beck was acting as agent for the Abbotts and
Joseph Low, (under whom the plaintiff, Morrill, claimed,) and
who resided in New Hampshire.
On the 31st of MAay, 1820, Beck wrote that he had found a
purchaser for eighty lots, (including the land in question,) at
fifty-seven dollars per lot, making four thousand five hundred
and sixty dollars, payable in nine, eighteen, and twenty-four
nmonths.
On the 12th of July, 1820, Low, who appeared to -anage
the business, wrote to Beck that he would accept the ofer
and send a power of attorney by the next mail.
On the 14th of July, 1820, the power was executed and

transmitted to Beck. The concluding part of the instrument
was as follows, viz:
"Have made, constitued, and appointed, iud by these presents do make, constitute, and appoint, Abraham Beck, of the
town of St. Louis, and State of Missouri, our tru'e and lawful
attorney, for us and in our names to sell and convey the whole
of the said described lands, and make, execute, and deliver
good and sufficient warranty deeds for each and every of the
aforesaid lands, and to grant and convey the same absolutely in
fee simple for such price or sum of money, and to such person or
persons as he may think fit and convenient, with such clauses,
over-acts, and agreements, as our said attorney shall think
fit and expedient, hereby ratifying and confirming, all such
deeds and conveyances, bargains and sales, which shall at any
time be made by our said attorney, touching or concerning
the premises.
"IIn witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and
seals, this fourteenth day of July, 1820; provided, however,
that the condition is understood to be such that our said
attorney is to take sufficient security on real estate for all the
above lands which may be sold on a credit.

On the 12th of September, 1820, Beck executed a deed to
O'Hara, in the names of his employers, "for and in consideration of the sum of three thousnd five hundred and thirty-four
dollars to them in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby
acknowledged."
On the same day, viz: September 12, 1820, O'Hara gave
six promissory notes to Beck, payable at different times, and
executed the following instrument:
"Whereas I have this day purchased of Abraham Beck, as
attorney of Joseph Low and others, ninety-two quarter sec.
tions of Illinois military bounty lands, for which I have agreed
to pay him at the rate of fifty-seven dollars each, amounting to
five thousand two hundred and forty-four dollars, which is payable, one-third at nine months, one-third at eighteen morths,

and one-third at twenty-four months, for which I have given
my notes payable as above; and whereas I have given my
notes payable as above; and whereas some defects exist in the
power of attorney by which he has conveyed fifty-seven quar.
ter sections, part of the above, I do covenant and agree with
the said Abraham Beck, that, whenever he gets a power of
attorney to convey said lots, and confirm his proceedings, and
deliver the same to me, that I will execute and deliver to the
said Abraham Beck, as attorney for the said persons mentioned, a mortgage upon good and sufficient real estate, sufficient to secure the payment of the above notes.

"Recorded December 6, 1821.
"WILLIAM H. OHARA."
In September; 1820, O'Hara mortgagedthe land to Cabann6,
which was acknowledged on the 80th of October, and recorded
oP the 21st of February, 1821.
On the 23d of November, 1820, Beck wrote to Mr. Low as
follows:
"I understood the intention of Mr. O'Hara, who is the purchaser, to be to give a mortgage on the lands. But it appears
I misunderstood him.. He offered to take the lands. at the
price and on the terms mentioned, and to give notes at nine,
twelve, and twenty-four months, secured by mortgage. I
understood, and so. I wrote to you, that the mortgage could
-be on the Inds; but he meant to give a mortgage on sufficient other property. This is a. difference of no consequence,
and I would have concluded the arrangement; but your power
of attorney was a limited -one, and under which a conveyance
could not be good.
"I therefore.made the best arrangement I could, which was
to make a conveyance of the property, and give a personal
glaranty that a proper power of attorney would be forwarded;
upon which Mr. O'Hara gave his notes as agreed, and arrange.d
the balance, and gave rie a covenant to execute a mortgage
upon sufficient real estate whenever a power of attorney, duly
executed, should arrive. I therefore consider the 7hing completed.

Aorrill v. Con d al.

"As to Mr. O'Hlara's standing and responsibility, I refer you
to Mr. Enoch Long, or to Major Long, both of whom well
know him. I have drawn a power of attorney, and have
shown [it] to Mr. O'Hara, who approves it. I enclose it to
you to be executed."
The power thus enclosed, omitted the proviso relative to
the security on real estate, retaining the date of July 12,
1820.
On the 12th of February, 1821, this power was again exe.
euted and transmitted to Mr. Beck; but before its execution.
Low added the proviso, making it read as before.
On the 80th of July, 1821, the power was recorded.
In October, 1822, the mortgage which O'Hara had given to
Cabann6 was foreclosed, and the land sold. The defendants
claimed under a deed from the commissioner appointed to
make the sale and several mesne conveyances, the last of which
was to the defendant, John Cone, in 1850.
The bill of exceptions recited the evidence to establish all
these facts, together with the deposition of Low, and concluded
as follows:
"This being all the evidence in the case, and the court being
of opinion that the title of the defendant, John Cone, to the
,premises in controversy, deduced as aforesaid, was a good and
valid title, superior and paramount to the title of the plaintiff,
so instructed the jury, who found their verdict accordingly."
Upon which exception, the plaintiff brought the case up to
this court.
It was submitted on printed argument by Mr. Williams for
the plaintiff in error, and Mr. Browning for the defendant.
The arguments of the counsel upon both sides were so
much involved with the questions of fact, that it would be
difficult to report any discussions of abstract principles of law.
They are therefore omitted.
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL delivered the opinion of the court.
This suit was brought for the recovery of a parcel of land .ly

ing in the tract appropriated for military bounties in Illinois,
and granted by the United States in 1818 to Benjamin Abbott,
a private in their army in the war of 1812, "s bounty. The
title of the plaintiff consisted of a certified c6py of the patent to
Abbott, and a quit-claim deed of Abbott to him, dated in 1855.
lie also produced a deed from Nathaniel Abbott to him, dated
in 1838. The defendants exhibited the original patent to Abbott; his deed to lNathaniel Abbott, dated in 1818, for the same
'and;' .adeed from Nathaniel Abbott, John Low, and John D.
Abbott, dated 12th September, 1820, to William O'Hara, and
executed by Abraham Beck as attorney, and connected themselves with this deed, by a number of mesne conveyances, the
last of which was to the defendants, and was executed in April,
1850. They entered upon the land under this deed, and paidtaxes until the commencement of this .suit. These conveyances were recorded in the proper 'office. The questions presented by the bill of .exceptions sealed for the plaintiff on the
trial arise on the conveyance to William O'Hara, by Nathaniel
Abbott, John Low, and Jobil D. Abbott.
This deed purports to have been made upon a pecuniary
consideration, the amount and receipt of which is acknowledged. The letter of attorney to Beck is dated the 14th July,
1820, and was recorded the 30th July, 1821. It authorizes
the attorney to sell and convey some sixty-four parcels of land,
including the one in dispute, in the military tract described in
a schedule annexed, for such price and to such persons as he
might think fit, and to make, dxecute, and delivei -good and
sufficient warranty deeds to them. To the ordinary testimonium clause a proviso was added, "that the conditon is understood to be such, that our said attorney is to take sufficient security on real estate for all the lands which may be sold on a
credit." The donors of this power of attorney reside in New
Hampshire; the attorney in Missouri.
The plaintiff read a deposition of John Low, one of the
donors of the power, from which we collect that Beck, the attorney, was verbally authorized to find a purchaser for the
lands des-ribed in the schedule, and other parcels in the mili.
tary tract in Illinois, and agreed with O'Hara upon the price

and term of credit. That this agreement was communicated
by letter to the witness, who sanctioned it, and sent a power
of attorney to Beck to complete the sale and to execute the
titles, but to reserve a mortgage on the lands sold to secure
the payment of the purchase money.
O'Hara objected to giving a mortgage upon the lands purchased by him, but offered to give security upon other real
.property. Thereupon the attorney prepared a deed for all
the lands embraced in the contract to O'Hara, and took his
-notes for the purchase, money, and gave to him his guaranty
that his constituents wbuld confirm the sale, and received from
him a covenant that whenever Beck should receive a power of
attorney to convey said lands and confirm his proceedings, and
deliver the same to him, O'Hara, he would deliver to Beck
for his constituents a sufficient mortgage upon real property
to secure the price. The power of attorney produced. by the
defendants was prepared by Beck without the condition, and
sent to Low, to be executed by him-and the others, to enable
him to fulfil the agreement. This was done by them after
adding the condition, on the 12th February, 1821. The witness says that there was no schedule attached to it. He answers from information and*belief that Beck did not collect
from O'Hara any money; or receive from him any further security. The district judge, upon this testimony, instructed the
jury that the defendants had the superior title, and their verdict was accordingly rendered for them.
The authority conferred upon the mandatary by the letter
of attorney is special and limited, and his acts under it are
valid only as they come within its scope and operation. He
was bound to conform to the conditions it contains, and in its
execution to adopt the nodes it indicates.
He was authorized to sell the lands for cash, or on a credit
with security on real property, to execute a deed describing
the consideration, acknowledging its payment, and to receive
the money or securities the purchaser might render. Peck r
Harriott, 6 S. and R., 149; 9 Leigh R., 387. But he was not
authorized to exchange the lands for other property, or to accept the notes of the vendee as cash, or to accept personal scVOL,. XXII

dition. .N(n est in faeultate mandatarii addere vel demere ordm
sibi dato. These propositions are not disputed as applicable to
cases arising between parties to the original contract, in which
the limitations on the authority and the circumstances of departure from it in the execution are understood. But it is
contended that bona fide purchasers are entitled to repose
credit in the recitals and declarations of the attorney as expressed in his deed, that disclose the mode in which the authority has been exercised, and will be protected against their
falsity. That the principal is estopped to deny their truth.
This argument rests for its support upon the hypothesis that
the delinquency of the mandatary is a breach of an equitable
trust, a trust cognizable in a court of chancery only, a court
that will not administer relief against a bona fide purchaser
having the legal title. It assumes that the deed made by the
attorney invests the grantee with the legal title, notwithstanding
the non-compliance with the condition. If this were true, the
inference would follow. Danbury v. Lockburn, 1 Meri., 626.
But the assumption is not tenable. The attorney was not invested with the legal estate. He was the minister, the servant,
of his constituent, and his authority to convey the legal estate
did not arise except upon a valid sale in accordance with the
requirements of the power.
Doe v. Martin, 4 T. R., 39; Minot v. Prescott, 14 Mass. R.,
495. The deed executed by the attorney is apparently within
the scope of his power, and the admission of payment of the
consideration is competent testimony of the fact. American
Fur Co.v. United States, 2 Peters R., 358. But it is competent to his principal to show that the transaction was in appearance only, and not in fact within the authority bestowed.
And the question arises, was there any testimony to be submitted to the jury to repel the presumption that there was a
bona fide execution of the trust reposed in the attor.ney? One
of the donors of the power, but who does not appear to be interested in the land otherwise than by the recital in that in8trunment, admits his knowledge of the terms of the sale made
to O'tara; that this power was remitted to Beck to validate

the contract, as far as it had been executed, and to enable him
to complete it according to the engagement that had been en'
tored into.
The power of attorney and the deed had been on the public records for thirty-fo.ur years before this suit was commenced, and for five years these defendants had been in the
actual possesion of the property. It had been repeatedly sold
during this long period. To the inquiry made of the witness,
whether the purchase money had been paid to the grantors, or
-vhether the security on real .property had been taken, he answers: "This affiant is informed and believes that most of the
lands were sold to William O'Hara without security, or the
payment of anything in hand upon the promissory notes of
the said O'Hara, which, as this afflant is informed and believes, were in the hands of Beck at the time of his death, and
'copies of which, * * as he is informed and believes, * * *
are annexed." It is the opinion of the court that this testimony was not admissible; and although it was read to the
jury, it did not contain anything to warrant a conclusion un-favorable to the title of the defendants.
