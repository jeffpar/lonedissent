v. United States.

that Percifull's right to appropriate the land in dispute was
undoubted, and that the register and receiver had allowed the
heirs of Belding to enter wrongfully; still, the courts of Arkansas, in this action of ejectment, had no right to interfere,
and set up Percifull's rejected claim.

But this is of little consequence, as, when the act of April,
1832, was passed, reserving the Hot Springs from sale, IPercifull had "no vested interest in'the land that a court of justice
could recognise. Then, the United States Government was
the legal owner, and had th power to reserv it-m
sale*_so
that the offer to purchase iu 1851, under the assumed -preference to entry claimed for Percifull, was inadmissible. Had ile
entry been allowed, in face of the act of Congress, such proceeding would have been merely void.
These being the only questions withief our jurisdiction
worthy of consideration in the causes Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, and
*19, it is ordered that the respective judgments rendered there
in by the Supreme Court of Arkansas be affirmed.

JuAw JosE GoNzALEs, APPLL"T, v. THE UNnBD STATES.
Where a grant of land in California describes it by name and boundaries, and
then states that the land of which donation is made is one league in length
and three-quarters of a league in breadth, a little more or less, as shown by
the map.which goes with the expediente, with the usual reservations of the
sobrante or overplus to the use of the nation, the grant will be confirmed to
the extent of one league in length and three-quarters of a league in breadth,
without extending it to the boundaries mentioned..

THIs was an appeal from the District Court of the United
States for the northern district of Oalifornia.
All the title papers are set forth in the opinion of the court.
It was argued by Mr. Hepburn, upon a brief filed by himself and Mr. Volney -. Howard, for the appellant, and by Mr.
Stanton for the United States.
VOL. XXI1.

SUPREME COURI.
Gonzake v. Un

)Sa.

The counsel for the appellant said t~his claim will be found,
on examination, to be one of the most meritorious that has
ever been presented for confirmation.
The Government has never opposed it; yet, under the
present decision, the claimant gains but little benefit from his
title.
The land commissioners, in their opinion, say that it is
a grant by metes and -bounds, and that, 3onsequently, no
sobrante can result; but, in their decree, they limit the extent
of the land from east to west to three-quarters of a league, a
liltle more or less.
The District Court affirmed the decision of the commissioners.
The claimant contends that the land should be confirmed
to the boundaries mentioned in the decree of concession,
making him, in the language of the decree of concession,
"the ow-ner of the land known by the name of San Antonio,
or El Pescadero, bounded by the rancho of Antonio Buelna,
the sierra, the coast, and the Arroyo del Butano," without
limitation as to quantity, there being none in the decree of
qoncession.
The quantity of land mentioned in the grant was erroneously inserted, through a clerical error, as we will show hereafter.
But, even admitting that it w's inserted correctly, it is insisted by the claimant that the quantity should be disregarded
where all the boundaries are given in a grant, as in this case.
The naming of a quantity of land in a grant, and reservation of the surplus to the nation, does not prevent the title
from passing to the grantee, if all the boundaries are given.
A clause in the grant, naming quantity and reserving surplus,
in such a case, is an unmeaning formula. The utmost effect
that could be given to the clause would be to reserve the
right to the Government, on proper proceedings, to divest the
title as to the surplus; but, in the mean time, the title to t.i
whole land is vested in the grantee.
This land is not claimed by any adverse claimant. The
Government never interfered with Gonzales in any way.

DECEMBER TERM, 1859

163

Gwzzakes v. Unie Stata.

It will be seen, by the testimony of Manuel Jimeno, that
Gonzalks had occupied the land from 1833. If the Government had the right to iesume the ownership of the surplus,
its non-action for so long a period raises a presumption of a
relinquishment of the right.
The quantity named'in the grant is a clerical error. It was
taken from the marginal note on the map, written by some
illiterate'person, and which the court will perceive, by inspection of the traced copy in the record, is such as would readily
mislead.
It describes the land as one league from north to south.
We cannot make out the word which professes to give the
distance from east to -west.
The map was made as part of the petition of Gonzales to
Figueroa for the land, and it was presented to Figueroa viith
the petition. Gonzales; in that petition, refers to the map,
and says that the ranch delineated on it includes "a square of
about four leagues, extending from the coast to the sierra, and
from the rancho of San Gregorio (raucho occupied by the
citizen Antonio Buelna) to the rancho Punta de Afo Nuevo,"
and asks for the whole tract, without any limitation of quantty.
It may' be remarked here that Gonzales states, in his peti-.
tion to Figueroa, that he had a family of thirteen persons,
and the grant recites that it is for his benefit and that of his'
family. He also states that he had five hundred head of cattle.
The rancho is pasture land. Four leagues was little enough
to provide for Gonzales's family and the increase of his stock.
There can be no doubt the Governor would have granted
him that quantity, or much more, if he had asked for quantity.
The land had been abandoned by the mission of Santa-Cruz,
and it was a benefit to the country to have it occupied.
Witnesses were. examined, by order of Figueroa, before he
made the decree of concession. .Salvio Pacheco says the
rancho is one league to a league and a half from east to west.
Manuel Larios .says that it is two leagues from the beach to
"lehills.
We may presume that the marginal-note had no: then been

SUPREME COURT.
Gam~ue" v. Mite SA3

wv-tten on the map, or, if written, it Fab not properly read
by the clerk who .biade out the grant.
The decree of concession evidently"intended to invest Gonzales with the'title to the whole tract, and it calls upon the
interested party again to "present his title, that it may be revalidated."
If the party is to get only the*quantity named in the grant.
he will be deprived by it, practically, of the greater part of"
his propietty.
The decre'c of concession gave him the whole tract. Does
the grant, which was made by virtue of the decree, and in
order to ":evalidate" it, take away the greater portion of the
land given by the decree?
The grant refers to the map, to ascertain the land, and ihe
map exhibits the natural objects which are its boundaries. â€¢
"Wl en a deed of land describes the subject matter by monuments clearly defined, such-as a river, a spring, a mountain,
a marked tree, or other natural object, and courses, distances,
and quantity, are likewise inserted, which disagree with the
monuments, the description by monuments shall, in general,
prevail; for it is more likely that a party purchasing or selling
land should make mistakes in respect to course, distance, and
quantity, than in respect to natural objects, which latter, from
being mentioned in the-.deed, are presumed to have been
examined at the time.
"The. monuments which shall control course, distance, etc.,
under such circumstances, may be any objects which are
visible and clearly ascertained, as lands of other individuals
or their corners.",
4 Phillips on Evidence, Cowen and Hill's notes, page 548,
and authorities there cited.
It is evident that the land commissioners thought that the
extent of the land from east to west as delineated on the map,
was no more than three-quarters of a league, otherwise they'
would have confirmed tle claim to a greater extent.
They have followed thepraseology of the grant, and added
the words, "a little more or less," to the designation of quantity, and perhaps these words give the claimant the whole

8. When the ownership is confirmed to him, he will request
the proper magistrate to give himjuridical possession in virtue
of this title, by whom the boundaries will be marked out-in
which, besides the bounds, he will place some fruit or forest
trees, of a useful character.
4. The land of which donation is made him is one league
in length by three-quarters of a league in breadth, a little
more or less, as shown by the map which goes in the expediente; the magistrate who may give the possession will
cause it- to be in conformity with the ordinance, in order to
mark out the boundaries, leaving the surplus which may result

Opinionof the Board by Com'r B. Aug Thompson.
For the place called San Antonio, or El Pescadero.-Claim of
for one square league of land in the county of Santa Cruz.
This claim is founded on a grant made by Governor Figue.
roa, on 24th December, 1833, to the present claimant, which
was duly approved by the territorial deputation on the 17th
day of May following. The grant describes the land as that
known by the name of San Antonio, or El Pescadero, bounded
by the rancho of Antonio Buelna, the sierra, the coast, and
the Arroyo de Butano. The fourth condition states that the
land of which donation is made is one league in length and
three-quarters of a league in breadth, a little more or less, as
shown by the map which goes with the expediente, with the
usual reservations of the sobra.ute or overplus to the use of the
nation. The boundaries are distinctly marked out on the
map; and although there is no scale on the map, by which the
extent of the boundaries can be ascertained, yet there is a note
made upon it, stating.that they extend one league from north
to south, and three-quarters of a league from east to west.
This description, taken in connection with that contained in
the grant, shows very clearly that it is a grant by metes and
rounds, and that consequently no sobrahte can result.

GOnzales v. Uniecl &Wwie.

The original grant is in evidence, and the genuineness of
the signatures of the Governor and Secretary appearing thereon are duly proved by the deposition of David Spence. Manuel
Jimeno proves that the claimant has occupied the land since
1833; that he had a house, horses, and sowings on it, and he
still lives on it.
Entertaining no doubt, from the facts of the case, that the
grant is a valid one to the extent of one league in length, and
three-quarters of a league in breadth, it is hereby confirmed to
that extent; the three-fourths of a league to be surveyed within the out-boundary represented on the diseno.
Mr. Justice CAMPBELL delivered a separate opinion, in
which Mr. Justice NELSOT concurred.
The plaintiff was confirmed in his claim to a parcel of land
designated as San Antonio, or El Pescadero, in the county of
Santa Cruz, by the board of commissioners. The description
of the land in their decree is as follows:
'Being the same which has been held and occupied by the
present claimant since-the year 1833 to the present time, and
is bounded as follows: Beginning at the mouth of the Arroyo
de Butano, and running along the sea coast, and bordering.
thereon, to the boundary line of Antonio Buelna, the distance
being one league, a little more-or less; thence with the line of
said Buelna east three-quarters of a league; thence a line
southerly parallel with the sea coast until it intersects the
Arroyo del Butano, at the distance of three-quarters of a
league from the coast; thence along said arroyo and bordering thereon to its mouth, the place of beginning; the same
being in extent three-fourths of a square league, a little more
or less. For a more particular description, reference being
had to the original grant and map contained in the expediente
from -the archives now in the custody of the United States
surveyor general for California, the first of which and a traced
copy of the latter are filed in the ease."
The parties appealed to the District Court, and, upon the
hearing of the cause, the decree of. the commissioners was
affirmed, and it was further ordered, that the claim of the

said Juan Jose Gonzales is a good and valid claim to the land
known by the name of San Antonio; or Pescadero, to the
extent and within the boundaries mentioned in the grant and
map, the original of the former and copy of the latter being
on file in the records of this case. From this decree the
plaintiff appealed. The only question presented on the appeal
is, whether the grant is to be located according to the natura
calls in the grant, or whether the clainiant is to be confined
to the quantity specified in the 4th condition of the grant.
But the decision of this question is reserved in the decree
of the District Court, and will properly arise after the location.
The failure to direct the precise manner of the location is not
erroneous. The result therefore is, that the decree must be
affirmed.

Where the matter in controversy was the right to the mayoralty in Georgetown,
tha salary of which office was $1,000 per annum, payable monthly, and the
dviation of which office was two years, this court has jurisdiction of a case
c'ming up by writ of error from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Columbia.
The fact that the salary is payable monthly makes no difference; the appyopriation, when made, being made for the whole sum.
A judgment of ouster being -rendered in the Circuit Court, and the defendant
having filed the uecessary bond, and sued out a writ of error to this court, this
amounts to a supersedeas upon the judgment.
The case is not a proper one for a mandamus from this court to the judges below, or for a rule upon them to show cause why they should not carry out the
judgment of ouster.
The fact that the term of office will be about to expire when the writ of error is
retunable, viz: December term, 1860, is not a sufficient reason for the inter.
position of this court at the present stage-of the proceedings.
