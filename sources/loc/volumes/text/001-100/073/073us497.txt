Opinion of the court.

EX PARTE

DE GRooT.

Mandamus from this court will not lie to reverse a judgment of a court
below, refusing a mandamus against the Secretary of the Treasury,
commanding him to pay a sum of money awarded to the relator by the
Secretary of War, in pursuance of a joint resolution of Congress, and
to compel such court below to issue one.

THIS was an application for a mandamus to the judges of
the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.
The petition was presented to that court praying for the
award of a mgndamus to the defendant, the Secretary of the
Treasury, commanding him to pay to the relator the sum
of $114,000, which had been awarded to him by the Secretary of War in pursuance of a joint resolution of Congress.
The petition set out at large the gifounds of the indebtedness
of the government to the relator, the joint resolution, and
the award of the Secretary of War for the amount above
stated. The court below denied the prayer for a mandamus,
and the papers were now presented to this court for a mandamus to the court below, for the purpose of reversing its
decision, and commanding it to issue the mandamus.
Mr. Brent, for the petitioner.
Mr. Justice NELSON delivered the opinion of the court.
The party has mistaken his remedy, if he has any, which
is by writ of error to the court below to reverse the judgment
there rendered in the case. The authorities are uniform on
the question.*
