THE BATTLE.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

THE BATTLE.
Capture as prize of war, jure belli, overrides all previous liens.

from the District Court of the United States for
the Southern District of Florida.
The libel set forth a seizure of the steamer Battle and
cargo on the 18th July, 1863, on the high seas, as prize of
war, which were brought into the port and harbor of Key
West. She was captured about fifty miles south-southeast
from Mobile Point by the United States steamer De Soto,
Walker commanding No claim of ownership for vessel or
cargo was presented to the court. The vessel had just run,
or was in the act of running, the blockade of Mobile when
she was captured. The vessel and cargo were sold pending the suit. The proceeds of the sale of the vessel were
$23,000, and of the cargo, $240,895.62. The vessel and
cargo were condemned for breach of blockade, and also as
enemy property.
There were two claims set up against the steamer in the
court below, one by James Brooks, of New Albany, State
of Indiana, foi supplies furnished at that port in May, 1860,
to the amount of $3408.82, and another by Daniel Hipple
and others for materials furnished, and for work and labor
in building a cabin on said boat, in January, 1860, to the
amount of $7230.92, at the port of New Albany aforesaid;
that after deducting all payments a balance remains due of
$3615.45. These claims were dismissed by the court below.
