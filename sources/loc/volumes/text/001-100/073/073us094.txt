[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

WicxER v. IJoPPooK.
1. The rules about judicial sales which make void as against public policy
agreements that persons competent to bid at them will not hid, forbid
such agreements alone as are meant to prevent competition and induce
a sacrifice of the property sold. An agreement to bid, the object of it
being fair, is not void.
2. On a breach of a contract to pay, as distinguished from a contract to indemnify, the amount which would have been received if the contract
had been kept, is the measure of damages if the contract is broken.

ERRORt to the Circuit Court for Northern Illinois.

Caldwell being owner of a distillery, subject to a mortgage to iloppock, leased it to Chapin & Co. for three years;
it being agreed by the lease itself that the rent, so much a
year, should be paid by Chapin & Co. directly to Caldwell
the mortgagee, so as to keep down in part the interest on the
mortgage. Chapin & Co., after being for about eighteen
months in occupation of the distillery, and accumulating at
it a considerable amount of personal chattels, such as are
commonly used about such a place, assigned the lease to one
Wicker under some sort of partnership arrangement, and
Wicker went in.. The rent not having been paid, according
to his agreement, by Chapin & Co. to iloppock, the mortgagee, Hoppock applied now to-Wicker to pay it, giving
him to understand that unless he did pay it, suit of foreclosure would have to be brought on the mortgage, and he
dispossessed. After some negotiations, Wicker, who it
seemed was desirous of becoming owner of the personal
chattels which Chapin & Co. had left at the distillery, agreed
with Hoppock that if he, iloppock, would sue Chapin & Co.
for the amount of rent in arrear and obtain judgment and
levy on the property, he, Wicker, "would bid it off for whatever the judgment and costs might be." iloppock did accordingly sue and obtain judgment against Chapin & Co.;
the judgmeut having been for $2206. Chapin & Co. were
indebted also to Wicker on some transactions growing out
of the distillery; and Wicker, who asserted himself to have
advanced money on it, caused most of the property already
mentioned as left by Chapin & Co., to be removed to Chi-

cago. tHoppock's counsel meaning to proceed with his
execution, gave notice to Wicker of the intention to sell and
of the day of sale. Wicker, however, did not attend the
sale, nor was any- bid made in his name. And all the property of Chapin & Co. that was there and could be levied on
was knocked down to iloppock, the only bidder, for the sum
of two dollars. Thereupon Hoppock brought assurapsitin
the Circuit Court for Northern Illinois-the suit belowagainst Wicker to recover damages for the breach of his
agreement to appear at the sheriff's sale and bid off the
propejqty levied on for the full amount of the judgment for
which the execution issued.
The court below, against requests by the defendant's counsel to charge otherwise, considered and charged1. That the agreement between Hoppock and Wicker was
not invalid as tending to prevent the fairness of a judicial
sale, and therefore against public policy.
2. That the measure of damages was the amount of the
judgments with interest and costs.
The case was now here on writ of error by Wicker, for a
review on these points.
Mr. C. B. Reed, for the plaintiff in error:
The agreement between Wicker and iloppock was invalid
because calculated to interfere with, and prevent the fairness
and freedom of a j udicial sale; and prevent competition, and
therefore against public policy.
1. The law guards all judicial sales with jealous care, and
any agreement or understanding, that any one person competent to bid will abstain from bidding, will not be enforced,
no matter how pure the motive moving to such agreement.
It matters not even if the defendant in the writ assents to
such agreement, for his creditors, as well as himself, have a
right to say that nothing shall be done tending to sacrifice
his property.* In this case, by carrying out the agreement,

IHOPPOCK.

[Sup. Ct.

Argument for the plaintiff in error.

Hoppock could not bid at the sale. It is no answer to say
that Hloppock was not bound to bid, and might not have
done so even if there had not been this agreement. It is
3ufficient to say, that independently of this agreement (which
in its spirit did put him under an obligation to leave all bidding to Wicker), be was competent and at liberty to bid.
โข2. As to the measure of damages. Hoppock himself now
holds the judgment against Chapin & Co., in full force, except as to the two dollars bid by himself; and he holds at the
same time a judgment against Wicker for the full amount
of such judgment, and he holds over and above both the
property sold to him at the sheriff's sale. And he would
seem to have the right to hold on to and enforce and enjoy
all unless this judgment against Wicker be reversed; for
Wicker does not stand in the relation of surety for Chapin
& Co., nor is he in any position upon any known principle
of law or equity, to be subrogated to the judgments against
them, on paying the judgment against himself. This sin
gular result is the consequence of the erroneous rule of
damages adopted by the court below. It arose out of a departure by the court from that salutary and elementary principle, that in all actions upon contract, " the damages are
strictly limited to the direct peduniary loss resulting from a
breach of the agreement in question."*
If Chapin & Co. were solvent, and they are presumed to
be,t then the direct pecuniary loss sustained by Hoppock by
the failure of Wicker to bid, was but nominal, as his judgments would be worth par, and they could be worth no more
had Wicker fulfilled his agreement. If they were good for
a portion, then Hoppock's direct pecuniary loss was only
equal to the balance. Whatever the property was worth
that IHoppock bid off at the sheriff's sale, should also be deducted from his direct pecuniary loss, for had Wicker bid
it off, ioppock certainly could not. Yet without any ref* Sedgwick on Damages, 204.

Opinion of the court.

erence to these questions, the court below instructed the
jury peremptorily to find as damages the full amount of the
judgments and interest.
Mr. S. W. Fuller, contra:
1. The rules relied on by the other side about judicial
sales only forbid agreements made with a fraudulent purpose, and agreements not to bid at such sales. See specially in
the Supreme Court of M'Aassachusetts, Phippen v. Stickney;*
in that of New York, Dare v. .Drew,t and in Illinois, Garreit v. M1oss et al.t
2. The amount which would have been received if the
contract had been kept, is the measure of damages, if the
contract is brokeu.ยง
Mr. Justice SWAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
It is said that the agreement between the parties " was
invalid because calculated to interfere with, and prevent the
fairness and freedom of a judicial sale; and prevent competition, and therefore against public policy."
The contract was, that the defendant in error should procure judgments against Chapin & Co. for the rent in arrear,
levy upon the machinery and fixtures in the distillery, and
expose them for sale, and that the plaintiff in error should
bid for them the amount of the judgments.
The validity of such an arrangement depends upon the
intention by which the parties are animated, and the object
sought to be accomplished. If the object be fair-if there
is no indirection-no purpose to prevent the competition of
bidders, and such is not the necessary effect of the arrangement in a way contrary to public policy, the agreement is
unobjectionable and will be sustained.

WICKER V. HOPPOCK.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

there was an agreement between two persons, that one of
them only should bid, and that after buying the property,
he should sell a part of it to the other upon such terms as
the witnesses to the agreement should decide to be just and
reasonable.
In another* it was agreed that a party should bid a certain amount for a steamboat, about to be sold under a chattel
mortgage, and transfer to the mortgagor an undivided interest of one-third, upon his paying a corresponding amount
of the purchase-money.
In a third caset the agreement was between a senior and
a junior mortgagee. The former agreed to bid the amount
of his debt for a specific part of the mortgaged premises.
In each of these cases the arrangement was sustained upon
full consideration by the highest judicial authority of the
State.
In the case before us the agreement was, that Wicker
should bid. There was no stipulation that Hoppock should
not. There was nothing which forbade Hoppock to bid, if
he thought proper to do so, and nothing which had any tendency to prevent bidding by others. The object of the contract obviously was to be secure-not to prevent bidding.
The benefit and importance of the arrangement to the interests of the judgment debtors is made strikingly apparent
when the subject is viewed in the light of the consequences
which followed the breach of the agreement. Instead of the
property selling for the amount of the judgments, iloppock
was the only bidder, and the property sold was struck off to
him for a nominal sum.
There was no error in the ruling of the court upon this
subject.
It is urged that the court erred in instructing the jury,
that if the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the measure of
damages was the amount of the judgments, with interest
and the cost.

Opinion of the court.

The general rule is, that when a wrong has been done,
and the law gives a remedy, the compensation shall be equal
to the injury. The latter is the standard by which the former is to be measured. The injured party is to be placed,
as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied
if the wrong had not been committed. Insome instances he
is made to bear a part of the loss, in others the amount to
be recovered is allowed, as a punishment and example, to
exceed the limits of a mere equivalent.
It has been held that, "where a party is entitled to the
benefit of a contract, and can save himself from a loss arising from a breach thereof, at a trifling"expense or with reasonable exertions, it is his duty to do it; and he can charge
the delinquent party with such damages only', as with reasonable endeavors and expense, he could not prevent."If the contract in the case before us were one of indemnity, the argument of the counsel for the plaintiff in error
would be conclusive. In that class of cases the obligee cannot recover until he has been actually damnified, and he can
recover only to the extent of the injury he has sustained up
to the time of the institution of the suit. But there is a wellsettled distinction between an agreement to indemnif\- and
an agreement to pay. In the latter case, a recovery may be
had as soon as there is a breach of the contract, and the
measure of the damages is the full amount agreed to be paid.
In a note of Sergeant Williams to Cttler and others v.
,Southetr aiid others, it is said that in all cases of covenants to
indemnify and save harmless, the proper plea is non dainnyficatus, and that if there is any injury, the plaintiff must reply
it, but that this plea " cannot be pleaded, when the condition is to discharge or acquit the plaintiff, from such bond or
other particular thing, for the defendant must set forth
affirmatively the special manner of performance."t

Opinion of the court.

fulfil all the covenants which the lessee was bound to perform. It was held that.the agreement was substantially a
covenant to pay the rent reserved, as it should accrue; that
a plea of non damnificatus was bad, and that the assignor could
recover the amount of the rent in arrear as soon as a default
occurred, without showing any injury to himself by the delinquency of t.he assignee. The assignee was liable also to
the lessor for the same rent by privity of estate. The judgment was unanimously aflirmed by the Court of Errors.
In The Matter of Negus,* the covenant was to pay certain
partnership debts, and to indemnify the covenantee, a retiring partner, against them. It was held that the covenant to
indemnify did not impair the effect of the covenant to pay,
and the same principle was applied as in the case of Port v.
Jackson. We might refer to numerous other authorities to
the same effect, but it is deemed unnecessary.
In the case before us, as in the cases referred to, the defendant made a valid agreement, in effect, to pay certain
specific liabilities. They consisted of the judgments of Hoppock against Chapin & Co. If Wicker had fulfilled, the
judgments would have been extinguished. As soon as Hoppock performed, the promise of Wicker became absolute.
NVo provision was made for the non-performance of Wicker,
and the further pursuit by iloppock of thejudgment debtors.
Indemnity was not named. That idea seems not to have
been present to the minds of the parties. The purpose of
ioppock obviously was to get his money without the necessity of proceeding further against Chapin & Co. than his
contract required. There is no ground upon which Wicker
can properly claim absolution. He removed and keeps the
property he was to have bought in. The consideration for
his undertaking became complete, when it was exposed to
sale. The amount recovered only puts the other party where
he would have been if Wicker had fulfilled, instead of violating the agreement.
The rule of damages given to the jury was correct.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
