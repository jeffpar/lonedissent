DECREE AFFIRMED.

UNITED STATES v. ECKFORD.
When the United States is plaintiff and the defendant has pleaded a set-off
(as certain acts of Congress authorize him to do), no judgment for any
ascertained excess can be rendered against the government, although it
may be judicially ascertained that, on striking a balance of just demands, the government is indebted to the defendant in such amount.
De Groot v. United States (5 Wallace, 482) affirmed.

APPEAL from the Court of Claims, the case being thus:

An act of Congress* of the 8d of March, 1797, ยง 3, provides
that where a suit is instituted against any person indebted to
the United States, the court shall, on motion, grant judgment
at the return term, unless the defendant shall, in open court,
make oath or affirmation that he is equitably entilled to credits
which.had been, previous to the commencement of the suit,
submitted to the consideration of the accounting officers of
the treasury and rejected, specifying each particular claim
so rejected in the affidavit. The same act provides, ยง 4, that
in such suits no claim for a credit shall be admitted upon
trial but such as shall appear to have been submitted to the
accounting officers of the treasury for their examination and
by them been disallowed, unless it shall appear that the defendant, at the time of trial, is in possession of vouchers, not
before in his power to procure, and that he was prevented
from exhibiting a claim for such credit at the treasury by
absende from the United States, or some unavoidable accident.
With this act in force, the United States sued the executors of Eckford, who had been collector of New York, ou his

official bond, in the District Court for Southern New York.
Among other pleas was that of set-off. The jury sustained
the plea, and certified that there was due from the United
States to the defendants, $20,545. On this verdict a judginent was entered, "that the United States take nothing by
their bill, and that the defendants go thereof without day;
and that the said executors are entitled to be paid the said
balance so certified," &c.
The claim not. being paid, the executors brought suit
against the United States in the Court of'Claims, and offered
the record of the Circuit Court in evidence. It was objected
to by the counsel of the United States; but the objection was
overruled and the record read, and judgment accordingly.
The United States appealed; and, divested of its special form
below, the question now here was, whether, when the United
States sued a person indebted to it, and a set-off to a greater
amount than the claim was pleaded and proved, a judgment
could be given against the United States for the excess.
By statutes of New York, in case of such pleas, "if there
be found a balance due from the plaintiff in the action to the
defendant, judgment shall be rendered to the defendant for
the amount."
Mllr. E. P. Noizton, for the United States, appellant,relied, as
concluding all argument, on De Groot v. United States,* where
this court says:
"When the United States is plaintiff in one of the Federal
courts, and the defendant has pleaded a set-off, which the acts
of Congress have authorized him to rely on, no judgment can be
rendered against the government, although it may be judicially ascertained that on striking'a balance of just demands the government is indebted to the defendant in an ascertained amount."
1eeside v. Walkert was cited to a similar effect.

supported by United Slates v. Wilins,* where Story, J., for
the court, in construing the act under which the set-off was
offered and proved, says:
"There being no limitation as to the nature and origin of the
cLIi~for a credit which may be set up in a suit, we think it a
reasonable construction of the act that it intended to allow the
defendant the full benefit at the trial of any credits which may
be set up in the suit. . . The object of the act seems to be to
liquidate and adjust all accounts between the parties."
How does the defendant here have "the full benefit of
any credit he may have," or how can "all the accounts between the parties be liq'idated and adjusted by the trial," if
the executors may not have judgment fbr the excess; the
law of the State where the cause is tried, permitting it?
The word of the statute-" credits "-is as comprehensive
as any that could be used. Any view opposite to this might
work'great injustice. To a claim on the partof the United
States the defendant would be compelled to interpose the
whole amount of his credits, and if they exceeded the plaintiff's charges, by a general verdict for the defendant, there
would be no means of determining the amount allowed by
the jury in reduction, and he thereby destroys his claim upon
the government for the balance. Again, suppose the set-off
to consist of a single claim or item, incapable of separation
or division in its proof or allowance, and it exceeds the plaintiff's demand. To prove any part is to prove the whole.
To decide in favor of a portion, must carry with it a deterniination in favor of the entire claim. Or, suppose the credits
to consist of several matters or items, no one of which is
equal to the plaintiff's debt, and yet any two are beyond
that amount. How, in either of these cases, is the defendant's cause of action to be divided and distitiguished?
In UVnited Slates v. Bank of the Metropolis,t the jury certified
a balance due the defendants from the United States, and
the judgment.upon the certificate was affirmed by the Supreme Court.

UNITED STATES V. EcKFORD.

Opinion of the court.

Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
Statement of facts shows that the United States, in June,
1839, brought an action of debt in the Circuit Court on the
official bond of the collector of the port of New York, against
the executors of Henry Eckford, who was one of the sureties
in that bond. Purpose of the suit was to recover moneys
which the collector had received as such, without having
ever accounted for the same as required by law. Defendants
interposed various pleas, and among others pleaded that the
moneys retained by the collector were received after he was
reappointed, and at a time when the testator of the defendants was not a surety. They also pleaded a set-off, claiming
that a large sum was due to their testator from the plaintiffs
on several accounts, and especially for the occupation of real
estate. Verdict of the jury was for the defendants, and the
jury certified, as stated in the record, that there was due
from the United States to the defendants the sum of twenty
thousand five hundred and forty-five dollars and fifty cents.
Judgment was accordingly rendered in the Circuit Court that
the defendants do go thereof without day, and that the surviving executors were entitled to be paid the balance so certified by the jurors.
Upon these facts the Court of Claims decided: (1) That
the Circuit Court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of
the suit, and the set-off pleaded. (2) That the finding of
the jury and the determination of the court constituted, in
substance and effect, a valid and binding judgment against
the United States for the sum certified by the jury. (3) That
such judgment, as it remains unsatisfied and unrecovered,
cannot be impeached in a collateral suit. (4) That the finding of the jury, under the circumstances stated, is conclusive,
and is not subject to re-examination in any Federal court by
virtue of the seventh amendment to the Constitution. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the court, the United States
appealed.
1. Settled rule of law, as universally understood, is that
the Judiciary Act does not authorize a suit against the

United States in any of the Federal courts. Where a party
contracting with the United States is dissatisfied with the
course pursued towards him by the officers of the government charged with the fulfilment of the contract, his only
remedy, except in the limited class of cases cognizable in
the Court of Claims, is by petition to Congress.*
The Supreme Court was created by the Conptitution, but
the Circuit Courts were created by an act of Congress, and
they are not authorized to exercise jurisdiction in any case
except where the jurisdiction was conferred by an act of
Congress.t
Jurisdiction cannot be exercised by a Circuit Court in a
suit against the United States, or against any other party,
unless the plaintiff can bring his case within some act of
Congress.1
Right of set-off, properly so called, did not exist at common law, but is founded on the statute of 2 Geo. II, c. 24,
s. 4, which in substance and effect enacted that where there
were mutual debts between the plaintiff and the defendant,
โข . . one debt may be set against the other, and such matter may be given in evidence under the general issue, or be
pleaded in bar, so that notice shall be given of the sum or
debt intended to be offered in evidence.ยง Such being the
general rule of law, it is quite clear that the right of the
claimant must depend upon the regulations prescribed by
Congress for the government of the Federal courts in suits
between the United States and individuals.
Where a suit is instituted against any person indebted to
the United States, the act of the 3d of March, 1797, provides
in its third section that the court shall, on motion, grant

judgment at the return term, unless the defendant shall, in
open court, make oath or afrmation that he is equitably entitled to credits which had been, previous to the commencement of the suit, submitted to the consideration of the accounting officers of the treasury and rejected, specifying
each particular claim so rejected in the affidavit. Section
four of the same act also provides that in suits between the
United States and iidividuals no claim fbr a credit shall be
admitted upon trial, but such as shall appear to have been
sul-mitted to the accounting officers of the treasury for their
examination, and by them been disallowed, unless it shall
appear that the defendant, at the time of trial, is in possession of vouchers, not before in his power to procure, and
that he was prevented from exhibiting a claim for such credit
at the treasury by absence from the United States, or some
unavoidable accident.* Same rules are prescribed in respect
to set-offs in suits against postmasters, except that the party
claiming the credit is required to present the claim to the
auditor of the Post-office Department.t
Extent of the authority conferred by that section is as plain
as any grant of power can well be which is conferred in clear
and unambignous language. Claims for creditin suits against
persons indebted to the United States, if it appears that the
claim had previously been presented to the accounting
officers of the treasury f-r their examination, and had been
by them disallowed, in whole or in part, may be admitted
upon the trial of the suit, but it can only be admitted as. a
claim for a credit, and not asa demand for judgment. Such
a claim for a credit shall be admitted, and if proved should
be allowed in reduction of the alleged indebtedness of the
defendant, even to the discharge of the entire claim of the
plaintiffs, but there is not a word in the provision conferring
any jurisdiction upon tlfe court to determine that the United
States is indebted to the defendant for any balance, or to
render judgment in his favor for the excess of the set-off
over his indebtedness as proved in the trial.

UNITED STATES V. ECKFORD.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Equitable claims for credit, though never presented and
disallowed, may be admitted upon the trial if brought withir
the conditions prescribed in the latter clause of the section
but if admitted they also are to be adjudicated as claims for
credit, and not as demands for judgment against the United
States.
Perhaps the best exposition of the law upon the subject is
given in the opinion of the court in the case of Reeside v.
Walker,* which was before the court on a writ of error to
-the Circuit Court of this district. Express ruling of the
court in that case was that no action of any kind could be
sustained against the government for any supposed debt,
unless by its own consent; and that to permit a demand in
set-off to become the foundation of a judgment would be the
same thing as sustaining the prosecution of a suit. Such a
proceeding, the court held, could not be upheld against the
government except by a mere evasion, which would be as
useless in the end "as it would be derogatory to judicial
fairness." All the court appear to have concurred in that
judgment, and in our opinion it is decisive of the present
controversy.
Attempt is not made to sustain the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in such a case by virtue of any provisions of any
act of Congress regulating judicial proceedings, but the argumnent is that the ruling of the court below may be supported because the law of the State may be regarded as the
rule of decision in the Circuit Court, and that by the law of
the State judgment in such a case may be rendered for the
defendant for the balance found due from the plaintiff.
Rules of decision undoubtedly are derived, in certain cases
in suits at common law, from the laws of the several States,
but the thirty-fourth section of the Judiciary Act does not
apply to the process or practice of the Federal courts, unless
adopted by an act of Congress, or some rule of court not inconsistent with the laws of the United States.t

UNITED STATES

v. ECKFORD.

Opinion of the court.

Extended argument upon the subject, however, is unnecessary, as the point has been directly determined in this court,
and ought not any longer to be regarded as an open question.
Speaking to the precise point, the court said, in United States
v. Robeson:* "This is a question which arises exclusively
under the acts of Congress, and no local law or usage can
have any influence upon it. The rule as to set-off in such
cases must be uniform in the different States, for it constitutes the law of the courts of the United States in a matter
which relates to the Federal government;" and in that view
of the subject we entirely concur.
The rule is, as there stated, that where a defendant has in
his own right an equitable claim against the United States
for services rendered or otherwise, and has presented, it to
the proper accounting officers of the treasury, who have refused to allow it, he may set up the claim as a credit on a
writ brought against him for any balance of money claimed
to be due by the government. Same rule is adopted by Mr.
Conklin in his valuable treatise, and we have no doubt it is
correct.t
Without extending the argument, we adopt the views expressed by this court in the case of De Groot v. United States,.
decided at the last term, that when the United States is plaintiff and the defendant has pleaded a set-off, which the acts of
Congress have authorized him to do, no judgment can be
rendered against the government, although it may be judicially ascertained that, on striking a balance of just demands,
the government is indebted to-the defendant in an ascertained amount.
Comment upon the other authorities presented by the
claimant is unnecessary, as we are fully satisfied that those
to which we have referred give the correct rule of law upon
the subject.
