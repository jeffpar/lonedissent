be to reverse the decree, and remand the cause to the court
below, with directions to enter a decree remitting it to the
District Court that it might be tried on the common law side
with a jury, the seizure having been made on land, and not
on waters navigable from the'sea. But, as the Supreme
Court of the Territory has reversed the decree of confiscation for the want of jurisdiction, in the correctness of which
judgment we concur, the proper disposition of it will be to
AFFIRM THE DECREE, as this reaches directly the right conclusion in the case.
NOTE. Like decrees were made in the similar cases of United States v
Crosby, and United States v. Gillet, as governed by this one.

CAVAZOS v. TREVINO.
1. Where an early Spanish petition for a grant of land described the land
by general boundaries, which were capable of an interpretation in twc
senses, one broader than the other, the terms of boundary open to question as to meaning were held to be rightly interpreted by the jury from
a survey carefully made on the ground by lines and monuments, and
specifying the quantity within the lines (the grant referring to the survey and specifying the quantity granted), and by practical interpretation, from occupancy and otherwise, by the parties interested in the
matter.
2. In settling, in such a case, what has been granted, the quantity of land
specified, as well as the boundaries named, and the survey as madeall are to be considered, and by their united light the proper conclusion
is to be reached.
8. The practical interpretation which parties interested have by their conduct given to a written instrument, in cases of an ancient grant of a
large body of land asked for and granted by general description, is
always admitted as among the very best tests of the intention of the
instrument.
4. In construing such a grant, the circumstances attendant, at the time it
was made, are competent evidence for the purpose of placing the court
in the same situation, and giving it the same advantages for construing
the papers which were possessed by the actors themselves.

ERROR to the District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas; the case being thus :
In 1776, Salvador de la Garza "denounced," that is to
say, made application to the authorities of New Spain for a
tract of land north of the Rio Grande, in the now State of
Texas, called sometimes the "Agostadero," and sometimes
the "Potrero" of the Espiritu 3anto.* The lands asked for
were described as bounded "on the east with the lagunes
(lagunas) of the sea; on the west by a thick wood;t on the
south by the margins of the Rio Grande, and on the north
by a ravine which comes out of the sea." In June, 1779,
the proper officer proceeded to take testimony as to the possession had of the land by Salvador, and of its boundaries
and character. There were five witnesses. They stated
that the "potrero" asked for had as its boundaries and outlines (linderos), the Arroyo Colorado,t the lagunes, the Rio
Grande, and a thicket-wood; three witnesses saying, "the
la.gunes;" one saying, "the lagunes of the sea;" and one,
"the lagunes immediately communicating with the sea."
The possession ofthe applicant being satisfactory to thejudge,
that officer proceeded, in company with Salvador, to make
an actual survey. The surveyor's record of this operation
first describes the nature of the ground as fit only for grazing, on account of the many marshes made by the tides of
the sea, and freshets of the Rio Grande and Colorado; that
* Both the words, "1Agostadero" and "Potrero," signify places for pasturing cattle; the latter word, perhaps, a place inclosed so as to keep them
in it.
t Salvador, at an early day, had cut a passage through this wood to get to
the potrero.

stream.

it had in many places a sort of grass which animals would
not eat, "which usually grows on salt marshes near the coast
of the sea;" on which account (with others set forth), "it is
only useful as regards horses and all other stock, by the

security which and protection which -is afforded, on account of the
potrero having but one entrance and exit through the dense thicket
which runs across it from the Colorado to the Rio arande."
The record then states that the survey begins at a watering-place for cattle, on the Rio Grande, in the southwest
corner of the tract, and that the first line ranged from it,
course east, going in a straight line from it, "along the banks
of Rio Grande, down the stream," 584 cords, at the river,
at a slough (derrame), from it, by which in its freshets it supplies a tank with water, "which was left lay above; bore up
stream at a distance of six cords, which slough was left
as a natural landmark," and a monument fixed; there remaining-the record said-on this line, to the south, recesses
and elbows formed by the Rio Grande, which "the surveyor
would notice hereafter."* This was one day's work.
The second day's record of the surveyor's action was
thus:
"In the said place of the slough of the river in which ended
the first line, he ran the second line straight to the north, and
at 206 cords we came to the head of one of the lagunes of the
sea, besides othess that were 'seen to the east, and having gone
xound the head of this first one and various others which succeeded, communicating with each other, following always the
north course, the surveying cord came to a little pocket or
meadow which the said lagunes make, these laying on the west
and east until they reach '.Lagunas Madres,' which are formed
by the Arroyo Colorado, and into which its waters empty, there
being far within this line (something more than a league), a
place improved. .. ; and there being no more land on account of
our having reached the said Lagunas Madres, and having
nothing before us but water, the second line amounted to 993
cords in the whole."
The derrame, tank, or slough, fixed as a point in the survey, was about
eighteen miles above the mouth of the Rio Grande

Dec. 1867.]

CAVAZOS

TREVINO.

Statement of the case.

The third day recorded that in the place on the Colorado
where it expands into the broad lagunes (Lagunes Madres),
the surweyor began the third line, running up the stream,
course west, &c., 584 cords, the same number with the line
on the Rio Grande; a part of the line, owing to impassable
ravines, thicket, &c., described, being conjectural.
A fourth line, in part conjectural, to the watering-place,
closed the survey.
The surveyor, noting that he bad estimated the elbows
made between the first line and the Rio Grande, declared
that "within the four said lines were contained 59 square
leagues (sitios de ganadas mayor) and 11- caballerias of
land."
After the survey was completed, the attorney of the treasury advised the granting of the "59 sitios de ganadas mayor
and eleven and a half caballerias of the Potrero Espiritu
Santo, under the natural outlines which the surveys state,"
and a grant itself was made to Salvador in due time afterwards (September 26th, 1781), of the same quantity of land,
described in the same words, "within the limits of the
colony of New Santander, and not exceeding its natural
boundaries."
Salvador took possession, and lived on the tract till 1802.
In that year he died, leaving three children, to whom his
estate went, as it seemed, equally, and to the rights of one of
whom, Cavazos, the present plaintiff, succeeded.
Salvador appeared to have had different ranctes on this
tract, and to have exercised more or less possession over
various parts of it.
In 1829 one Trevino, who, as it was said, truly or not so,
had beet) but an agent of some of the children or grandchildren of Salvador, joining himself with some other parties,
occupants of the soil, and, as was attempted to be proved, coowners with the plaintiff of the undivided whole, applied to
the state authorities of Tamaulipas and got grants for the
parts which lie east of the line marked on the map as the
surveyor's line; tracts.designated as San Martin, Sta. Isabel,
and Buena Vista. Cavazos, who, as already said, had suc-

ceeded to the rights of one of Salvador's three children, now
brought trespass to try title to the thirdtf a part east of the
line and to recover possession, the question in controversy
being the eastern boundary of the tract; and this, perhaps,
being complicated by the fact that there was on most of the
eastern side of the tract a long body of water, called the
Laguna Madre, made by a long narrow island, running outside the shore (a place likened by counsel somewhat to
Long Island Sound), and also numerous smaller lagunas,
running into the coast. Whether the land ran to the shore,
which brought it to the Laguna Madre, and in one sense to
the sea-shore, and in one, to the laguna of the sea, or only to
the little lagunas, which might in one sense be called the
lagunes of the sea, and in another but lagunes of the sound
or Laguna Madre, this was a question. One part of the
strip-a part between the mouth of the Rio Grande and the
Boca Chica-was on the sea; no lagune running beside it.
The plaintiff adduced witnesses" to show occupancy by
Salvador with more or less specific assertion of title over
every part of the tract; that by the term "potrero" was
meant a place so inclosed by natural boundaries as that cattle
put there to graze could not easily get out of it; that the
tract derived its chief advantage to Salvador from its thus
being a potrero; that it could only be so by coming to the
water's edge along its whole eastern line; that it was not
customary in. early Spanish surveys to meander along either
rivers or curved shores, but to make elbows and estimate;
that if the surveyor hid gone to the mouth of the Rio Grande
and then north, he would have run into the sea; and that if
he had meant to run the eastern line in a convenient way,
and to survey by running base lines by cardinal points, the
land inclosed by the thicket, the Rio Grande, the lagunes,
and the Colorado, he would have run the lines much as he
did; and finally, to show that according to general reputation the property of Salvador was a potrero, a place for
grazing inclosed by four natural boundaries. As matter of
argument he relied on the principle of law that parties are
never presumed to leave a narrow strip between land and

water merely because certain stakes or trees stand at a
slight distance from the river.
The evidence of the defendants was to prove long adverse
possession on their part up to the surveyor's line; that the
term "potrero" did not mean so absolutely as was asserted an
inclosurefor feeding cattle; that whatever Salvador had asked
for or desired, this was controlled by the survey actually
made and the monuments fixed; that it was impossible
to regard as unmeaning the fact, that the surveyor had made
no reference to such monuments as the mouth of the Rio
Grande and the shore of the Gulf of Mexico.
In the course of the trial the plaintiff excepted to the ad.
mission and to the exclusion of various testimony, and on its
conclusion to instructions given and to those refused by the

court. All these, and what is further necessary to be known
of the case, are stated by the learned justice who gave the
opinion of the court.
M1essrs. Hale and Robinson, for the plaintiff in error; Messrs.
Sherwood and -. -Hughes,contra.
Mr. Justice SWAY-E delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in error brought an action of trespass in the
court below to try the title to the real estate in controversy
between the parties, and to recover possession. There were
numerous defendants. The suit was dismissed, or judgment
by default rendered as to all of them but the two who are
before us as defendants in error.
The plaintiff sought to recover an undivided third of the
premises, which are claimed to be a part of the tract known
as the Agostodero, "and the potrero of the Espiritu Santo
grant," situated between the Arroyo Colorado on the north,
the Rio Grande on the south, and extending from a thick
wood on the west to the lagunes of the sea on the east. The
real controversy between the parties was as to the locality
of the eastern boundary line of this tract.
The land in controversy lies between that boundary as
claimed by the defendants in error, and the sea and lagunes
communicating with the sea.

CAVAZOS

v.

TREVINO.

[Sup. ot.

Opinion of the court.

The plaintiff deraigned title by a grant from the authorities
of New Spain, of the 26th of September, 1781, to Jose Salvador De la Garza, containing fifty-nine leagues and eleven
and a half cabellerias of land.
The defendants claimed under a grant made by the authorities of the State of Tamaulipas, by a title of possession issued to Ignaceo Trevino, on the 26th of February, 1829, and
confirmed by a final title issued by the governor on the 29th
of Mfay, in the same year. The defendants insisted that the
western boundary of the land embraced in this grant was the
same as the eastern boundary of the tract granted to De la
Garza, as they alleged that boundary to be, while, according
to the plaintiff's claim, all the land granted to Trevino was
included in the prior grant to De la Garza.
The court instructed the jury substantially:
(1) That the question in controversy was the true eastern
boundary of the Espiritu Santo tract, and that it was a question of fact to be determined by the jury upon the evidence
before them.
(2) That it was their duty to consider all the testimony
bearing upon the subject.
(3) That if those claiming under the Espiritu Santo grant
had never been in possession east of the line claimed by the
defendants-had acquiesced in that line, and set up no claim
inconsistent with it, until within a comparatively recent
period-those ficts were proper to be considered by the
jury.
At the request of the defendants, the court further
charged(4) That the grant itself shows that a corner was established at the derrame or slough, 548 cords from the beginning corner, whence a line was run north by the tanque
mentioned in the grant to a pocket or small potrero on the
Laguna Madre, where another corner was established, and
that this was to be considered the east boundary, unless
another one was established by the evidence.
(5) That if Trevino and those claiming under him had
lield adverse possession up to the line run for the western

Opinion of the court.

boundary of the San Martin grant to the time of the commencement of the action-being a period of ten years or
more-in good faith under a just title, then the jury should
find for the defendants.
(6) That if Trevino and those claiming under him had
held adverse possession of the land in controversy for twenty
years and more, before the commencement of the suit, then
the jury might presume a vdlid grant giving title to the land
claimed.
(7) That if the jury find there never was any contest before the commencement of this suit between the owners~of
the Espiritu Santo grant and Trevino-except as to boundary-being a dispute whether the true line was that run in
1781, or that of 1828 rup for the western boundary of the
San Martin grant-and that Trevinp and those claiming under him had possession up to 1828, adversely to those claiming the adjoining land in the Espiritu Santo grant, and up
to the commencement of the suit, the jury may presume
that the land within the line of 1828 belongs to the San
Martin grant.
To all these instructions the plaintiff's counsel excepted.
The plaintiff's counsel then asked the court to instruct
the jury(1) That if they find that the Espiritu Santo grant ineluded the land in controvers', then no adverse possession,
subsequent to that grant, can authorize the presumption of
another and an adverse grant.
The court refused to give this instruction, and an exception was taken.
The plaintiff's counsel thereupon asked the court further
to instruct the jury(2) That a party in possession under an undivided grant
of a tract of land, and claiming the whole under a paramount
title, is in possession of the whole, and is not affected by an
adve'se possession of a part, claimed and held under ah
inferior title or without title, and that the person holding
under s.uch inferior title can have no protection from the
statutes of limitation or by prescription.

CAVAZOS v. T EvINo.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the cQurt.

This instruction was given, but at the request of the counsel for the defendants, it was modified as follows:
(3) That if Trevino and those claiming under him had
exclusive possession for twenty years or more, east of the
boundary line in dispute, then a grant may be presumed to
him, though the Espiritu Santo grant is the elder one, and
there has been possession under it west of that line.
To this modified instruction the plaintiff excepted.
The jury found for the defendants, and found further,
"that the eastern boundary line of the Espiritu Santo grant
of 1781, is a line commencing at the mouth of the derrame
of the tanque on the Rio Grande, and thence running north
to the ocket described in said grant."
The plaintiff thereupon moved for judgment, non obstante
veredicto, for so much of.the premises in controversy as lies
east of the line established by the verdict, and west of the
line of 1828, being a gore, containing, according to the testimony of one of the witnesses, about nine leagues of land.
The court overruled the motion and the plaintiff excepted.
Exceptions were also taken by the plaintiff to the admission and to the exclusion of testimony, which will be stated
specifically when we come to consider them.
It is insisted by the plaintiff in error, that the court erred in
construing the documentary evidence relating to the eastern
boundary of the Espiritu Santo grant, and that it adopted
the theory of the defendants. We do not so understand the
charge as to the latter point. It is somewhat confused both
in thought and language, but its general effect is clear. It
left the question to the jury, to be determined according to
the evidence, without any controlling instructions upon the
subject. They might consistently with the charge have
found the line claimed by either party to be the true one.
If any error was committed by the court against.the plaintiff, it was in not recognizing, as matter of law, the line
insisted upon by her, instead of submitting the question to
the jury.
Did the court err in withholding this recognition in the
ncharge ?

Dec. 1867.]

CAVAZOS v. TREvInO.
Opinion of the court.

The denunciation, and the identification of the line by the
witnesses, describe it as bounded on the coast by the lagunes
of the sea. The most important testimony is the survey, the
facts attending it, and the subsequent links in the chain of
title. The survey was made with great care and formality.
It commenced at a watering-place on the Rio Grande, in the
southwest corner of the tract. The first line was run 584
cords down th.e river to a slough, near a tanque, which was
filled from the river during high water. This slough was
designated "a natural landmark," and the denunciant was
ordered to place there an artificial monument. From this
point, the next day, the second line was run due north. At
the end of 206 cords the surveyor came to the head of one
of the "lagunes of the sea"-others were seen to the east.
Having gone round the first and others that succeeded, following always the north course, the line reached a little
pocket or meadow made by the lagunes. They were found
to extend to the lagunes madres which were formed by the
Arroyo Colorado. Having reached the lagunes madres, and
there being nothing before them but water, the surveyor
there terminated the line of that day, which was found to be
993 cords in the whole, in length. "The bend or little
pocket befbre mentioned," it is said, "remained as a natural
landmark." An artificial one was also placed there. Owing
to natural obstacles, the other two boundary lines were designated without actually running them. The last one terminated at the beginning corner. According to the rule of
the Spanish law, where a survey is intended to bound on a
stream, a straight line was run from the beginning point to
its termination at the slough, and the quantity of land in
the bends of the river was ascertained by computation without actual measurement. The slough was about five leagues
fi'om the mouth of the r ver. If it were intended that the
eastem boundary should be the shore of the sea, and of the
lagiunes connected with it, why was the first line terminated
at the slough, and why wag a line run due north from there?
Why was not the first line extended to the mouth of the
river, or to a point nearer to it, and a line run thence to the

OAVAZOS v. TnEVINO.

[Sup. Ot

Opinion of the court.

north. The lagunes of the sea, and not.the shore of the
sea, is called for as the boundary on that side. The proof
shows that those lagunes could form such a boundary only
in part. There is no controversy that the Rio Grande is the
south boundary. The proof shows also, that from the mouth
of that river north it is several miles to the Boca Chica, which
is the first lagune found there. For the intervening distance
the shore of the sea, and not lagunes of the sea, must be the
boundary according to the claim of the plaintiff in error.
There is nothing which shows that the land lying between
the east line as run, and the shore of the sea, and of the
lagunes communicating with the. sea, was included in the
computation, or that the grantee had not his full quantity
without it.
The attorney of the treasury advised the granting of the
"59 sitios de ganadas mayor, and eleven and a half caballerias of the Potrero Espiritu Santo, under the natural outlines which the surveys state."
The grant itself was of the same quantity of land, specified in the same terms, "within the limits of the colony of
New Santander, and not exceeding its natural boundaries."
In construiug this grant, the attendant and surrounding
circumstances, at the time it was made, are competent evidence for the purpose of placing the court in the same situation, and giving it the same advantages for construing the
paper, which were possessed by the actors themselves. The
object and eff et of such evidence are not to contradict or
vary the terms of the instrument, but to enable the court to
arrive at the proper conclusion as to its meaning and the
understanding and intention of the parties. Viewing the
subject in this light, we cannot say that the legal effect of
the grant is to carry the eastern boundary of the grant to the
line contended for by the plaintiff in error. Whether of
itself it fixes that boundary, as is insisted by the defendants
n error, is a question which in this case it is not necessary
to determine. It is enough to say that the instructions on
the subject given to the jury were as favorable to the plaintiff as she was entitled to ask. If there was an error, it was

Dec. 1867.]

CAVAZOS v. TREVINOm.
Opinion of the court.

not against her. There is nothing of which she has a right
to complain. The quantity of land specified, as well as the
boundaries named, and the survey as made, is to be considered. It is by their united light that the proper conclusion is to be reached. Together, we think, they leave
little room for doubt as to the intention and effect of the
grant.
The finding of the jury that the line surveyed was the east
line of the Espiritu Santo grant, renders what was said by
the court as to adverse possession and the presumption of a
grant immaterial in the case. Right or wrong, those instructions could have done the plaintiff no injury, and,
therefore, constitute no ground for disturbing the verdict
and judgment.
The instruction given as to the acquiescence of the parties
in respect to the line run for a long period, was correct.
Thepractical interpretation which the parties, by their conduct, have given to a written instrument in cases like this,
is always admitted, and is entitled to weight. There is no
better test of the intention of the instrument. None are
less likely to be mistaken. There is no danger of too large
an admission. Safer testimony can hardly be presented in
relation to any transaction occurring in human affairs.
The motion for ajudgment non obstante veredicto assumed
as correct a construction of the grant, the opposite of the
views we have expressed. We think it was properly overruled.
Upon the trial the defendants offered in evidence a copy
of the record of the original proceedings relating to the
Santa Isabel, San Mfartin, and Buena Vista, grants, in surveying which it became necessary to ascertain and fix the
east line of the Espiritu Santo grant. The plaintiffs objected
to the admission of this testimony, upon the ground, that at
the time of the recordation of the documents there was no
law which authorized them to be recorded. This objection
was overruled, and the plaintiff excepted. The defendants
then proved the genuineness of the signature of Domiugo
De ]a Garza, and that he was alcalde of Matamoras in 1829.

Opinion of the court.

They also proved the signatures of the assisting witnesses,
and that they were dead.
The plaintiff then objected to the admission of the testimony, upon the further grounds that the document did not
appear to be the first copy or testimony issued to the interested party; that it was not proved to be a true or compared copy, of the original protocol, and because it did not
appear that the original protocol was duly signed by the
proper officer. These objections were also overruled, and
the plaintiff excepted.
The questions thus presented are to be decided by the
light of the statutory provisions of the State of Texas which
bear upon the subject. We have carefully examined those
to which our attention has been called. They are found in
Arts. 745, 2754, 2758, 2787, 2800, in iartley's Digest. The
result is, that we are satisfied that the testimony was properly admitted. It could serve no useful purpose, and would
greatly extend this opinion, to go into a full examination
of the subject. We deem it sufficient to announce the conclusion at which we have arrived.
The defendants next offered in evidence a copy, proved to
be correct, from a paper on file in the archives of the city
of Mexico, purporting to be a conveyance from Maria Francesco Cavazos to Miguel Paredes. The plaintiff objected to
its admission, because it did not appear that Francesco"
Cavazos had ever executed the instrument, or authorized the'
instrument to be executed for her. We do not deem it
necessary to examine the su~bject in the light of the Spanish
law, to which our attention has been called. As the case
was before the jury when the evidence was closed, we think
it was entirely immaterial. Its admission or rejection could
not change the result. If improperly admitted-a point
which we do not find it necessary to consider-it did the
plaintiff no injury, and, therefore, constitutes no reason for
reversing the judgment. The power of attorney made by
Prieto to Trevino, the will made by Trevino under that
authority, and the conveyance by Prieto to De la Garza,
offered in evidence by the plaintiff,, and excluded by the

court, were clearly irrelevant and incompetent. The ruling
of the court was correct.
The same remarks apply to the proceedings before the
Supreme Court of Tamaulipas, also offered in evidence by
the plaintiff. They were properly excluded by the court.
The title-papers relating to the grant to Trevino were again
objected to by the plaintiff upon the grounds: (1) That the
land which appeared to have been granted by the authorities of Tamaulipas was within three littoral leagues of the
coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and that the approbation or
consent of the general executive of Mexico was not shown.
(2) That the grant appeared on its face to be for more than

ings, that a controversy had arisen during the survey as to
the ownership of the land afected thereby, and that it had
not been settled in the usual and proper manner, but by the
exercise of authority assumed by the executive officers, contrary to the colonization laws of Mexico and Tamaulipas.
The court sustained the first objection, and the documents
were excluded as showing a valid grant of land, but were
allowed to be read in evidence to show boundary and possession. To this qualified admission of the testimopy no
exception appears in the record. We need not, therefore,
consider the learned and elaborate argument submitted by
the counsel for the defendants in error to show 'that the
documents were admissible for all purposes, and that the
objections of the plaintiff in error to their admission are
untenable.
These are all th.e exceptions to which our attention has
heen called.
We find no error in the record, and the
JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED.
