THOMAS M.

LEAGUE, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. JOHN DE YOUNG, SURVEYOR FOR THE DISTRICT OF GALVESTON, AND SAMU EL P. BRowN,
DEPUTY.

Before the admission of Texas into the Union, that State passed many laws upon
the subject of head rights to laud, the general object of which was to ascertain and
secure valid titles, and prevent frauds, by acts of limitation and by the establishment of boards of commissioners to separate the bad from the good titles.
In the constitution adopted just before her admission into the Union, there was an
article annulling fraudulent certificates, and opening the courts, up to a certain day,
- to suitors for the investigation of their claims.
It was perfectly competent for the people of Texas to pass these laws and adopt this
constitution.
Moreover, they were all passed before the Constitution or Lhe United States bad any
operation over Texas, and cannot therefore be in conflict with any of its provisions.

TIs case was brought up from the Supreme Court of the
State of Texas, by a writ of error issued under the twentyfifth section of the Judiciary Act.
The plaintiff in error, Thomas AL League, applied to the
District Court for the county of Galveston, in Texas (State
court), for a mandamus to be issued to John De Young, the
surveyor, and his deputy, to compel them to survey cc league
and labor of land, which League alleged that he was entited
to by virtue of a certificate issued to Catin F. McRea by the
board of land commissioners of the county of San Augustine,
