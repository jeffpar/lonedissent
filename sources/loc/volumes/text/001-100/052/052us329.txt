expressions: "my estate to be equally divided
Where a will contained the following
"
amongstmy children," and also, mylands and sla'es to be equally divided amongst
my children"; and had in it also the following clause: " to each of my daughters a
small tract of land," - the last clause must be rejected as void and inoperative, an4
cannot be used for the purpose of showing such au ambiguity as would let in extrinsic testimony to explain the intentions of the testator.
When such testimony is introduced, it must be of facts unconnected with any general
declaration or wishes expressed by a testator for the disposition of his property.
In the present case, the testimony offered purported to express those wishes, and
was therefore inadmissible.
Where the Circuit Court instructed the jury that they might consider the acts of one
of the daughters and her husband, in acquiescing in a partition, and in receiving
"a small tract of land," as a recognition of the true construction of the will to be,
that the daughters were not entitled to an equal share, the acts of partition being
accompanied by long adverse possession, say thirty or forty years, this instruction
was erroneous.' The daughter was a minor when she married, and continued covert
until within a short time before .she brought the suit. No presumption, arising
from her acts, could therefore be made against her.
And a recognition by her, when freed from coverture, of a sale which she had made
in conjunction with her husband, amounted to no more than a ratification of that
particular sale.
So, also, an instruction was erroneous, that the jury might presume from the evidence
that there had been a legal partition of the testator's laud in respect to his daughters,
by order of a court, when the executor assigned to them certain parts of it. By
.the laws of the State where the lands were, such a partition was a judicial act, and
became a record.

The doctrine of presumption As to records, or proving their existence aliunde, explained.
In the present case, the proof is that the partition was not made by the order of a court.
THIS case was brought up, by writ of error, from ihe Circuit
Ooufl of the United States for the Middle District of Tennessee.
The whole evidence given upon the trial in the Circuit Court
was incorporated into the bill of exceptions, which must be inserted in this statement, and the preliminary narrative must
therefore be brief.
. On the 20th of July, 1788, Anthony Bledsoe was killed by
the Indians under circumstances which are minutely detailed
in the evidence. The will which was executed by him, whilst
in great bodily suffering and surrounded- by an alarmed family,
was as follows : -.

"In the name of God, amen.
"Being near to death, I make my will as follows: I desire my
lands at Kentucky to be sold, likewise.my land on Holston, at
the discretion of my executors; my children to be educated in
the best manner my estate will permit; my estate to be equally
divided amongst my children; to each of my daughters a small
tract of land; my wife to keep possession of the four oldest
negroes for the maintenance of the family; my lands and slaves
to be equally divided among my children. I appoint my brother,
Isaac Bledsbe, and Colonel Daniel Smith, executors, with my
wife, Mary Bledsoe, executrix. At the decease of my wife, the
four above negroes to be equally divided among my children

Term, 1788.
"The last will and testament of Anthony Bledsoe, deceased,
was produced in open court, and proved by the oath of Thomas
Murray and Hugh Rogan, subscribing witnesses thereto. Recorded and examined October 18, 1788."
At this time Bledsoe had ten children, viz.five sons and five
daughters. After his. death a posthumous daughter was born.
Polly, who 'afterwards rharried Weatherhead, and was the
plaintiff in error, was the eighth child.
In 1793, the executor and executrix (and after the death of

the executor, the executrix alone) conveyed to three of the
daughters each a tract of land, by deeds of which the following is an example:"This indenture, made this 3d day of January, A. D. 1793,
between Isaac Bledsoe and Mary Parker, executor and executrix of Anthony Bledsoe, deceased, of Sumner County, and
territory of the United States, south of the river Ohio, of the
one part, and David Shelby, of the county and territory aforesaid, of the other part, witnesseth: That they, said Isaac Bledsoe and Mary Parker, pursuant to the last will and testament
of the said decedent, hath given and granted, aliened, enfeoffed, and confirmed, and by these presents doth give, grant,
alien, enfeoff, and confirm, unto the said David Shelby, all that
tract or parcel of land situate in the county aforesaid," &c.,
&c., containing 320 acres of land more or less.
In 1796 the records of the District Court of Mero District,
on the equity side thereof, were burned and destroyed. This
court had jurisdiction of the partition and division of estates
and other matters in equity in the county of Sumndr, where
the lands were situated, from the time of m~.king the will until the destruction took place.
In 1799 Polly, being then a minor, married Weatherhead,
and immediately thereafter took possessioli of the 320 acres
which were assigned to her.
On the 5th of January, 1801, the residue of the land which
remained after giving the daughters 320 acres each was divided amongst the sons, by commissioners appointed by an
order of Sumner County Court.
On the 19th of August, 1818, Polly Weatherhead and her
husband sold to her brother, Henry R. Bledsoe, the tract of land
which had been assigned to her, and shortly afterwards removed to Mississippi.
In 1843 Mr. Weatherhead died.
In October, 1846, Polly Weatherhead brought an action of
ejeetment in the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Middle District of Tennessee, against the persons named in the
titling of this report, for the whole tract of 6,280 acres. The
defendants appeared, confessed lease, entry, and ouster, and at
March term, 1847, the cause came on for trial. Under the
charge of the court, which is set out in the bill of exceptions,
the jury found a verdict for the defendants.
The following is the bill of exceptions.

SUPREME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

Catron and Morgan W. Drown, judges, and a jury; when, to
maintain the issue on her part, the plaintiff introduced in evidence and read a grant to Anthony Bledsoe, for 6,280 acres
of land, from the State of North Carolina, described as is stated
in the declaration, and proved that she was one of the eleven
children of Anthony Bledsoe, deceased, who died in 178S.
She then offered to read a copy of the will of Anthony Bled"soe, from the records of the County Court of Sumner County,
to the reading of which copy the defendants excepted, but the
court admitted the copy as -proper primd facie evidence for
plaintiff.
" And suggesting fraud and mistake in the drawing and obtaining the will, and irregularity in the executing or attestation
thereof, and insisted that the original will should be produced
in..court, and the said original will was produced accordingly;
a copy of which, with the probate thereon, is hereuntq annexed, marked A, and made a part of this bill of exceptions.
"In admitting General Hall's evidence, he stated what Isaac
Bledsoe and his wife had told him was the true will of Anthony Bledsoe. That is, in substance, that each of the testator's daughters shall have a small tract of land, and that on his
(Generai Hall's) repeating the statements of Isaac Bledsoe and
his wife to Rogan, he said that the statement made to General
Hall was about what had occurred in substance. Rogan having proved the will in the Sumner County Court in 1788, as
a subscribing witness thereto, the court held that the will, according to the State laws of North Carolina, was prinidfacie
established, and that a copy might be read by the plaintiff; and
.which was read accordingly. The court also held, that, to
make Rogan's proof valid, it must be presumed by the court
and jury that Rogan proved all the necessary facts to constitute a good will to pass lands, the same as if Rogan then had
proved the same facts before the jury. -But thbt evidence
might be let in on the trial to contradict what Rogan was presumed to have proved in 1788, before the Sumner County
Court when the will was there recorded. It was proved that
Rogan had been dead for many years, and that the other subscribing witnesses were also dead. The copy was offered and
admitted, and General Hall's evidence in opposition to the validity of the will adjudged to be proper, and heard to the extent
above stated, in the progress of the trial, afid one day before
the original will was produced, on a subprna duces tecunz, issued on the part of the defendants to the officer having the
same in his custody.
The defendants, except the two Stuarts, were proved to have
been in possession at the time of bringing this suit. To the

reading of the original paper writing called the will, or so much
thereof as contains the devise of the lands equally among his
children, the defendants objected, and the plaintiff then proved
tie handwriting of Anthony Bledsoe and of the three subscribing witnesses, and that they were dead. It was also proved
by the plaintiff that none of the sons of A. Bledsoe had taken
possession of the Greenfield land until after the marriage 'of
plaintiff.
"312-s. Shelbyis Evidence.
"It was proved by Mrs. Shelby, that her sister (the plaintiff)
had always complained about not getting an equal share of
all the lands of her father under the will, and that she returned
from Alabama or Mississippi several times, and tried to have
suit brought for it.
"Dr. Shelby's Evidence.
"It was proved by Dr. Shelby, that James Weatherhead had
come into this country several times about this business, and
claimed his wife's eleventh part of the land. There was no
proof that this.claim of wife or husband came to the knowledge
of defendants, or those under whom they claim.
"l3alone's Evidence.
"It was proved by William Malone, that, about fifteen years
ago, a contract was made by the plaintiff, or her husband, with
an attorney, to bring suit in this case, but being unable to give
security for a fee of $ 600 then agreed upon, the suit was not
brought and the thing failed; they came to this State several
other times on this business, but could never get the suit commenced. It was also proved that James *Weatherhead, the
husband of the plaintiff, was an honest man, of good common
sense, but deficient in energy and resolution. He was a ' good,
easy man,' and died insolvent.
" Hal's Evidence.
"General William Hall was introduced biy the plaintiff. He
proved the boundaries of the grant,-dated
day of
1787; that he surveyed the land called for in the grant; the
number of acres called for in the grant is 6,280, but it held out
250 acres more; that all the defendants were in the possession
of the land called for in this grant at the commencement of
this action, except the two Stuarts; that the plaintiff. Polly
Weatherhead, was a daughter of Colonel Anthony Bledsoe; lie
thinks in 'the fall of the year 1799 she intermarried with James
Weatherhead, she then being uider the age of twenty-one

years. Being cross-examined by defendants, states that he was
well acquainted with Colonel A. Bledsoe, who was killed by the
Indians in 1788; that his house stood within about six feet of
the house of Colonel Isaac Bledsoe at the time A. Bledsoe was
killed by the Indians; Ant. Bledsoe had a fort upon the Greenfield grant; Isaac Bledsoe at Bledsoe's Lick; the Indians had become very troublesome, and Ant. Bledsoe had broke up his fort,
and moved into the fort of Colonel Isaac Bledsoe. Upon the
night of the 20th of July, 1788, about the hour of midnight, the
Indians appxoached the house of Isaac Bledsoe, and lay in ambuscade about forty yards in front of the passage dividing the
house, and, with a view of drawing out those in the house,
caused a portion of the Indians to ride through a lane rapidly
by the house; upon which Anthony Bledsoe and his servant
man, Campbell, aiose, and walked into the passage, when A.
Bledsoe and Campbell were both shot down. Colonel A. Bledsoe was shot with a large ball, which struck within a half inch of
his navel, and passed straight through his body, coming out at
his back; and from the great pain and rack of misery he suffered from the time he was shot till his death, he was satisfied
his intestines were torn to pieces; he died at sunrise the next
morning.
"The witness states that the firing of the Indians aroused him
to his gun. He heard great lamentations in the house of Colonel
A. Bledsoe, and he went down to the fort yard to ascertain
who was shot;' he was informed that Colonel A. Bledsoe and
Campbell were mortally wounded, and some said that preparations were being made for writing his will. He, on consultation with others, concluded to put himself in a condition to resist an anticipated attack from the Indians, and returned to
their portholes awaiting the attack, and there remained until
about the break of day, when he went into the room where Colonel A. Bledsoe lay; he died about one hour afterwards; he did
not hear Colonel A. Bledsoe speak on the subject of the will;
he understood that he had made his will. Shortly after the
burial of Colonel A. Bledsoe, he was still living in the fort with
Colonel Isaac Bledsoe; he conversed with Isaac Bledsoe and his
wife, Caty, on the subject of the will, and they both informed
him that, shortly after Colonel A. Bledsoe was shot; they
knew from the character of the wound that he mtlst shortly
die; Caty went to her husband, Isaac Bledsoe, and told him
he must see his brother, and suggest to him that he must die,
and that some provision should be made for his daughters; for
if he should die without a will they would get no land, and
the chief of his estate consisted in lands; that this suggestioa
was immediately made to Anthony Bledsoe -by Caty Bledsoe,

in the presence of Isaac Bledsoe; and Anthony Bledsoe said
to his brother, that if he. would get pen and ink, he would
make his will; Isaac Bledsoe said he stepped to the passage
and called Clendening from the other room, and he told Clendening that he must come and write his brother's will; that he
himself was so confused and agitated that he could not write
it himself; they got a table and placed it near him, and whileClendening was writing the caption of the -will, Anthony Bledsoe observed to Isaac Bledsoe that he wanted him and Colonel
Daniel Smith and his wife to act as executors and executrix of
his will, as he intended -to leave considerable discretion with
him in carrying out his will; Anthony Bledsoe was suffering
great pain, and Caty Bledsoe got up behind him in the bed,
and supported him till the will was finished. Isaac Bledsoe
said to. Colonel A. Bledsoe, lr. Clendening is ready to write
your wi ," how do you want your property disposed of? And
Bledsoe stated to Clendening, that he wanted to leave a small
tract of land to each of his daughters, at the discretion of his
executors, and the balance of his lands to his sons, except his
land on Holston and in Kentucky, and them he wished to be
sold to raise and educate his children; and the balance of his
property to be equally divided between all his children, except
the four oldest negroes, and them he wished to remain with
his wife till her death, and then to be equally divided among
his children. He shortly after saw Hugh Rogan, a subscribing
witness to the will, who lived within the fort till 1793, and had a
conversation with him in regard to the will of Colonel A. Bledsoe; and detailed to him what Colonel Isaac Bledsoe and wife
Caty had told him about the making of the will, the same that
is above specified, and that Hugh Rogan then said it was
about what A. Bledsoe said on that occasion, in substance.
About the time that Isaac Bledsoe was about to lay off .the
land to the four oldest daughters, witness was present, to wit,
in 1793; and witness asked him what he considered would be a
small tract of land under the will, when Colonel Isaac Bledsoe
observed to him that less than 320 acres would not make a
good plantation, and that hn intended to give his own daughters 320 acres each; and that he intended to assign to his
brother's daughters 320 acres of the best of the land out of the
Greenfield survey, and done so. Three of the deeds, marked
Nos. 1, 2,.3, and made part of this bill of exceptions, to wit, to
David Shelby, William Neely, and James Clendening, who
had married three daughters, show the land out of the Greenfield tract assigned them. They immediately took possession
of the land, all parties being well pleased. Clendening died on
his in the year 1822, when it descended to his children; Neely

336

and Penny continued in possession of theirs till they sold, and
their assignees yet remain in possession. Shelby continued in
possession of his till his death, in 1822; Mrs. Sally Shelby sold
it, and her assignees continue in possession to this day. Each
of the trdcts contains about 400 acres.
" General Hall further stated, that the plaintiff, F olly Weatherhead, married James Weatherhead, he thinks, in the fall
of the year 1799, and immediately thereafter took possession of their 320 acres assigned them out of the Greenfield
grant. She and husband continued in possession till they
sold it to her brother, Henry R. Bledsoe. Their deed, of
the 19th of August, 1818, is here exhibited, marked No. 5,
as part of this bill of exceptions. Shorfly afterwards Weatherhead and wife moved to Mississippi. He never heard her
or him put up any claim to any other portion of the Greenfield tract, in opposition to the right of the boys, 'jenry R.,
Abraham, and Isaac Bledsoe, nor held any talk witn her on
the subject. The balance of the grant of the Greenfield tract,
in January, 1801, was divided among the boys by the commissioners, as appears by the deed here exhibited, marked No. 7,
as part of this bill of exceptions. Isaac Bledsoe took possession, for himself and brothers, of this iand, before, 1801 ; he
thinks in 1799, but would not be certain; whether before or
after the marriage of plaintiff, cannot say; he thinks the
guardians of the boys and girls rented the Greenfield tract out
from 1796, till Isaac Bledsoe took- possession himself, but is
not certain; that Abraham Bledsoe continued in possession of
the land assigned him till his death, about 1816 or 1817; Henry R. Bledsoe of his till his death, in 1822; Isaac Bledsoe of
his till he sold to David Chenault, the defendant, and John
Patterson. The deeds are here exhibited, all of which is admitted; need not copy them. Since the year 1800, Isaac,
Henry R., and Abram Bledsoe, and their assigns, have held
the peaceable and adverse uossession of said tract of land devised as aforesaid. Previous to the year 1818 there were extensive clearings and improvements upon the land of the boys;
many h6uses erectod; and from that period to the present
time those clearings have been extended, and some very val.
uable brick buildings been erected and possessed by some'of
the defendants. The improvements of this land are extensive,
valuable, and permanent, and have been made from the year
1800 up to the present time.
" The Testimony of General William Hall, continued.
"The defendants read the deed from Nathaniel Parker and
Mary Parker, dated 30th January, 1796, for 640 acres of land,

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

337

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

which lies within the bounds of the Greenfield grant, as proved
by the witness, General Hall, 'who stated that the executor of
Anthony Bledsoe made the deed to take up a bond of Anthony Bledsoe to Hugh Rogan. The defendant Francis Rogan lives on the part of the Greenfield grant conveyed to his
father, Hugh Rogan, as aforesaid. The defendants then read
the bond of A. Bledsoe to Hugh Rogan, dated the 18th of
April, 1783, referred to in the testimony of General Hall, exhibit No. 8; need not be copied. The deed is referred to, exhibit No. 9. The defendants read the deed from the executor
and executrix of Anthony Bledsoe, to wit, Isaac and Mary
Bledsoe, of the 6th of April, 1700, exhibit No. 10, to William Bowman. General Hall proved that he was present
when this land was run out; that he saw the bond of Colonel
Anthony Bledsoe, which was assigned to William 1Bowmah
for this land; andihat the executor deeded this land to Bowman in discharge of the covenants of said land, and this land
lies within the bounds of the Greenfield grant.
"The defendants read the grant of the State of North Carolina, dated the 27th of June, 1793, for 640 acres, and likewise
read the entry of the 14th of February, 1784, upon which the
grant was founded, exhibits No. 11 and 12; need not be copied.
General Hall proved that the grant of Evan Evans. lies within
the bounds of the Greenfield grant. The defendants read the'
deed of release from the plaintiff, and Martha Patterson, the
wife of James Patterson, to John Patterson, (said Pattersons
married daukhters of James Clendening and Betsey Clendening,) dated the 14th of August, 1846. General Hall proved
that this release not only embraced the 320 acres assigned the
plaintiff, but likewise 335 acres of land, lying within the bounds.
of the Greenfield grant, which is not sued for. A deed fromn
Henry R. Bledsoe to John Patterson, Jr. was read, exhibit. No.
14. General Hall proved that this was the tract assigne& to
the plaintiff. The record of the County Court of Sum] er was
read, showing that the guardiafis of the girls listed the 320
acres of the Greenfield grant from 1794 till their marriage; and
the sons of Anthony Bledsoe, by their guardians, listed the
balance of the Greenfield grant for the boys. General Hall
proved that the taxes were paid accordingly as listed. General
Hall proved that the plaintiff had some eight or ten children,
the oldest about forty-eight years; some four or five sons-iilaw; and that she and husband, on several occasions, have
been in the county where the land lay, since their removal
from the county, as before statd. General Hall- proved the
handwriting of Anthony Bledsoe to the original will; and
likewise 'the handwriting of the three subscribing witnesses;

and that the said Rogan and Clendening were men of the very
highest character for integrity and truth. The deposition of
Mrs. Desha, which is to be copied as part of this bill of excep.
tions, was read by the defendants.
"The plaintiff's counsel objected to that part of General Halls
testimony in which he details what he may have heard Isaac
and Caty Bledsoe and Hugh Rogan say in relation to the circumstances that attended the making of the will, on the ground
that it was hearsay. But the court allowed it to go to the
jury, to which the plaintiff excepts. The plaintiff objected to
all the testimony tending to prove any thing, or state of facts
contrary to the written will, or to show that any thing was
omitted or inserted in the will through mistake.
"2l rs. Read's Evidence.
"The defendants introduced Mary Read. She proved that
she was well acquainted with Colonel Anthony Bledsoe; he
was her uncle. In the year 1788, her father, Isaac Bledsoe,
was living in the fort near Bledsoe's Lick; it was very troublesome times with the Indians. Colonel Anthony Bledsoe had
left- the Greenfield tract, and was living in one end of my
father's house. About midnight of the 20th of July, 1788,
after the families had retired to bed, James Clendening announced -that he had discovered some Indians near the houses.
Colonel 'Anthony Bledioe got up and went into the passage
with Campbell, it being a clear moonlight night, when Campbell was killed dead, -and Colonel Anthony Bledsoe mor-ally
wounded by a shot from the Indians, the ball having passed
directly through his body. I was in the house of Isaac Bledsoe, my father, at the time; there was difficulty in getting
light; at length Hugh Rogan went to the kitchen and got fire;
immediately after, Anthony Bledsoe was shot; be was drawn
into the house, having fallen from the shot; when the light
came, his wound was examined and discovered to be mortal;
he was in extreme agony; no mortal could have suffered more;
his intestines were shot and torn ; and what is called his caul
fat came out to a considerable length; he continued to suffer
immensely till his death, which occurred about sun up next
morning; there was great confusion in the room, great lamentation and grief among the familk, and those present; with all,
a momentary attack was expected from the Indians till day.
Shortly after the light came, Anthony Bledsoe asked my
mother, Caty Bledsoe, what she, thought of his case. She
told him he must iievitably die, and that he ought to make
preparation for another world; he'seemed to have.a great deal
of concern about that; after a little, my mother, suggested to

him that four of his oldest children were girls, and if he died
without a will his girls would get none of his lands, and the
chief of his estate consisted in lands; and suggested the idea
of his making a will, in order to make some provision for his
daughters; he seemed to hesitate, and said he did not know
who they would marry, but said in the presence of my father
and mother, and others, that, if they would have it wrote, he
would make a wi
" I distinctly recollect, that he said that he wanted his Kentucky and Holston land sold, and the proceeds applied to the
education of his children; that he wanted a small tract of land
given to his daughters, at the discretion of his executors; the
balance of his lands to be equally divided among his sons;
that the four oldest negroes to be kept by his wife during her
life, and the balance of the property to be equally divided
among all his children. James Clendening approached a table
near where he lay, and commenced writing the will. I did
not hear what he said when the will was writing, if he said
any thing. I was present all the time, from the time the will
was first suggested to him to the time of his signing his will;
heard him make no other disposition of his estate, but that
which is detailed above. My mother got behind Anthony
Bledsoe, and held him up with her knees; he talked but little,
was in extreme agony all the time; when he talked, he talked
sensibly up to his death. I do not know whether the will was
read over to him or not; he signed his name to it. My fpLther,
Isaac Bledsoe, was standing by him when my mother suggested to him the propriety of making the will; was present
during the whole time of the writing of the will, and was over
him when he died. I was about ten years of age at that time;
the occurrences of that night made a deep and lasting impression on my mind; I recollect what was said and done more
distinctly than transactions of late date, and this has been impressed upon my mind by conversations with others since.
James Clendening, the drawer of the will, shortly afterwards
married.one of the daughters of Colonel Anthony Bledsoe; he
and Hugh Rogan resided in my father's fort some four or five
years afterwards; my father was appointed an executor with
the widow, previous to his being killed by the Indians; in 1793,
pursuant to the request and will of my uncle, he assigned to
David Shelby, who had married Sally, the oldest daughter, a
small tract of land, the boundaries of which contain about four
hundred acres, as appears gy the deed; the other three daughters, to wit, Betsy, who married James Clendening, Rachel,
who had married William Neely, Susan, who had married
William Penny, received and had assigned to them their por-

tions, as appears by their respective deeds signed by the executors in the year 1793, containing 400 acres of land, all of
which was taken out of the Greenfield survey, covered by the
grant of 1787, exhibited by the plaintiff in the cause. In addition to these four children, Colonel Anthony Bledsoe at his
death had the following: Thomas and Anthony, both of whom,
under age, were killed by the Indiang in the year 1794, Anthony in April, and Thomas in October, 1794; Isaac, Polly,
Abram, Henry, and Prudence, who was born after the death
of her father, being eleven in number. David Shelby, James
Clendening, William Neely, William Penny, Joseph Sewell,
and James Weatherhead all married daughters of Colonel Anthony Bledsoe, and were smart business men, and some of
them married fifty or sixty years ago. James Weatherhead
married the plaintiff, Polly, she thinks in the fall of 1799, and
the next year took possession of the 320 acres laid off to her
out of the Greenfield tract, and continued in possession for
many years, till they sold to Henry R. Bledsoe, her brother, as
appears by their deed of the. 19th of August, 1818, which is
exhibited, marked No. 5. Sewell and his wife Prudence got a
like portion of land assigned them, from the southeast corner
of the grant; all of which portions they possessed and enjoyed till they were all sold, except Clendening's lot, which de.
scended to his heirs. Clendening died in 1822; Isaac Bledsoe
took possession of the balance of the Greenfield tract for himself and brothers about the year 1800, she is not positive
whether it was before or after, and that portion was divided
between them, as appears by the report of the commissioners
in 1801.
"_Parker's Evidence.
"Nathaniel Parker, a witness for defendants, proved that he
has always resided near the Greenfield tract of land since the
year 1796. That Isaac, Henry R., and Abram Bledsoe, and
the-defendants claiming under them, have had the possession
of the lands sued for since the year 1799 or 1800, cultivating
and improving the lands, building houses, &c., since that period.
That James Weatherhead married the plaintiff in the fall of
1799. That they took possession of the 320 acres of land
assigned the plaintiff, he thinks in the year 1800; that they
were close neighbors of his;, was intimate with them; James
Weatherhead worked on his house; Penny, who married a
daughter of Colonel Anthony Bledsoe, was his brother-in-law;
he was well acqainted with Joseph Sewell, James Clendening,
David Shelby, and William Neely, who married likewise
daughters. They were all smart men. Weatherhead was an

acting justice of the peace for Sumner County for many years;
David Shelby was the guardian of Polly Bledsoe, the plaintiff,
and was the clerk of the County Court of Sumner for some
thirty years, and pursued his own interest closely. That during all this intercourse and acquaintance, he never heard any
claim on their part upon any portion of the Greenfield tract assigned the boys.
" Carr's Evidence.
"John Carr, a witness for defendants, proved the same facts
in substance proved by Nathaniel Parker.
" It was proved by competent testimony, which the plaintiff
does not require to be copied into this bill of exceptions, that 4
division was made of the residue of.the Greenfield survey after
taking out the shares assigned the daughters, the land conveyed
to Rogan and Bowman, and the land covered by the Eyan
Evans grant, between the three remaining sons of Anthony
Bledsoe, by partition in a court of record, and that possession
was continued under this division, and the deeds made under
it, till the bringing of this suit, there being a regular chain of
title from said partition, which was made in 1801.
"It was 'further proved, that possession had been taken by
said sons jointly in the year 1800, adversely. The plaintiff
and her husband having in that year also taken possession of
the 320 acres laid off to them by the commissioners, no written
evidence of which was adduced.

"3lc Gavock and Hickman's Evidence.
"It was proved by Jacob McGavock and Thomas, Hickman,
that the records of the District Court of Mero District on the
equity side thereof were burned and destroyed in the year
1796; and it appeared by competent proof, that this was the
court having jurisdiction of the partition and dii ision of estates
and other matters in equity in the county of Sumner, where
the land in controversy lies, from the time of the making of the
will to the date of the destruction aforesaid.
"It is admitted that the land in controversy exceeded the
sum or value of two thousand dollars.
"

Carge of Court.

"Whereupon the court charged the jury as follows: "We are first of opinion, that parol evidence may be heard
to the following extent, in reference to the devises in the will
of Anthony Bledsoe: The clause, ' to each of my daughters a
small tract of land,' we regard as directly conflicting with the
clause, 'my lands and slaves to be equally divided amongst
29*

342

-SUPREME

COURT.

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerrille et al.

my children.' It is contended by the plaintiffs, that by these
devises the daughters not only take equally with the sons the
lands of the testator, but that an additional small tract is also
given to each daughter. From the then state of the law of
descents, which excluded the daughters, and from the number
and circumstances of the testator's family and estates, we think
this construction of theconfticting clauses cannot be adopted;
but that the clause which gives to each of the daughters a
small tract of land must be regarded as unmeaning and useless. That it stands in conflict with an equal division is undeniable. The question then is, whether this inconsistency on
the face of the will authorizes proof extrinsic of the recorded paper, to show that it was the intention and will of Colonel Bledsoe to give the daughters each a small tract of land only, and
not an equal share, as contended by the defendants. The distinct question for the jury to try is, whether Anthony Bledsoe's
will was, that his daughters should each have a small tract of
land and no more. To find this to be the true will, the jury
must find that the clause, 'my lands to be equally divided
amongst my children,' was not Anthony Bledsoe's will, but
inserted without his instruction or knowledge, and contrary to
his intention, wish, and will.
"A paper writing, purporting to be a man's will or deed, executed and proved according to the forms of law, shall always
be deemed such, unless positive proof of the contrary is made
out clearly. In the case of a de'ise, it must be shown that
the testator's will and intention was different at the time of
making the instrument, and that that will and intention was
not embodied in the writing, either by fraud or inistake at the
time; or, in other words, that that which he positively willed
was wrongfully set down, either designedly, which would be
fraud, or not designedly, which would constitute mistake; but
both standing upon the same principle in law and in fact, in
an issue of devastavit vel von; and on these principles the jury
will proceed to consider the case.
"The witnesses state that Colonel Bledsoe was shot in July,
1788,on the premises in dispute, where his family resided, and
where his wife and children continued to reside for many years
thereafter; that he was shot by the Indians through the centre
of the body, and his bowels torn to pieces. He was in his own
fort, between two log-houses, in a passage, where he received
the mortal wound and fell, another (his servant) being killed at
the same fire; that he was carried into one of the houses.
This Was about midnight, and he died after daylight next
morning, being in extreme pain, and writhing much all the
time after he received the mortal wound up to the time when

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

343

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

he died. During this time Isaac Bledsoe, and especially the
wife of Isaac, proposed to their dying brother to make a will;
the main intention of which was, to make a provision for his
daughters out of his lands, they being cut off by the statute of
descents. That at the time there was extreme distress*in the
house; various women, children, and men in it, and much
confusion; that James Clendening (who was in the fort with
many others) was sent for (he being on guard) to write the
will, and did so, at the bedside of the wvounded testator; that
the will was executed before daylight. These facts we understand to be undisputed; but whether they are or are not correctly stated the jury will judge, our object being to state only
such an outline of the facts as to make the charge to the jury
intelligible, as regards the application of the rules of evidence
to the case submitted to the jury. They will take into consideration the situation of the testator, and all the circumstances
that surrounded him, at the timie he was making his will, that
is, during the time that Clendening was writing it, all that was
said to him after he was shot and before Clendening commenced
writing the will, and all that the testator said and did during
these times, and all that was said to him after Clendening commenced writing the will and before it was completed, in regard
to its contents. The jury will next consider the conjoint acts
of Polly Weatherhead and her husband, and the acts of all the
other devisees of Anthony Bledsoe, in instances where the
whole of the devisees (including said Polly and her husband)
are concerned in dividing the estate of the said testator, and
see how far they mutually recognized the true will to be, that
each of the daughters should have a small tract of land, but
not an equal division by the partition they actually did make
amongst each other; and especially how far Polly concurred
in these acts of partition, and in a mutual occupation of the
lands each devisee took. These acts are evidence that is
strengthened by the lapse of time, and of long acquiescence on
the part of Polly, if the acts of partition were accompanied by
long adverse possession, each devisee holding adversely, and
for her or himself, the parcel of land partitioned to him or her,
say for thirty or forty years, under the partition.
"If the jury find-from the evidence that the will of the testator was, that each of the daughters should have a small tract
of land and no more, and find that Polly had partiti6ned to
her the 320 acres, out of the south side of the Greenfield tract,
as such small tract, then she has no right to recover in this
action.
"And as to the fact of a legal and binding partition among
the devisees of Anthony Bledsoe, we think, and so instruct the.

344

SUPREME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

jury, that, if they believe the facts given in evidence, then they
would be authorized to presume that a legal partition had been
made, the evidences of which had been lost by the accidents of
time, and that Polly Weatherhead had legally received her
share of the lands of the testator. In regard to the statute of
limitations, the jury is instructed that, if Polly Weatherhead,
by her guardian, had a joint possession of the land in dispute
with her brothers, all claiming as tenants in common, and that
such joint possession continued up to the time of Polly's marriage with James Weatherhead, then the act of limitation has
not barred her right of recovery, if she sued within three years
after her husband's death.
"The jury is further instructed, that, if they find for the plain.
tiff, they must find Tor one eleventh part of so much of the land
sued for as was partitioned -to the brothers of Mrs. Weatherhead, unless the plaintiff has relinquished her right to some
part of the same.
"In regard to that part of General Hall's evidence where he
deposed as to what Isaac Bledsoe and his wife told him respecting the intention of the testator, and which statements of Isaac
Bledsoe and his Wife General Hall repeated to Hugh Rogan, the
subscribing witness to the will, and who (with Thomas Murray,
another subscribing witness) proved the will in the ordinary
form in 1788, and which statement was affirmed by Rogan to
be substantially accurate, the jury will consider the evidence as
intended only to impair the proof of Rogan in so far as the alleged mistake in the will is assumed to exist; but General Hall's
evidence being competent, the jury may ascertain how far it
comes in support of Mrs. Read's statement, and the acts of the
plaintiff and her husband, in affirmance of the mistake alleged
to have been made by Clendening in drawing the will, if such
acts there be. To which charge, the plaintiff, by her counsel,
excepted.
"The jury then rendered a verdict for the defendants; and
the plaintiff then moved the court for a new trial, which was
refused. To all which decisions of the ccurt in the admissions
of the evidence excepted to, and the charge of the court to
the jury, and the refusing a new trial, the plaintiff excepts, and
prays hii bill of exceptions to be signed, sealed, and made a
part of the record, which is done accordingly.
"J. CATRON,
M. W. BRowN."
Upon this bill of exceptions the case came up to this court.
It was argued by Mr. Xlfeigs, for the plaintiff in error, and
Mr. -Fogg,for the defendants in error.

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

345

Weatherhead's Lessee r. Baskerville et al.

Mr. .Ttfeigs for the plaintiff in error.
The lessor of the plaintiff, Polly Weatherhead, being one of
the children of Anthony Bledsoe, the patentee of the land in
dispute, claims title to an undivided eleventh part of it, under
his will, which is in the following words: "In the name of God, amen. Being near to death, I make
my will as follows:
"1. I desire my lands in Kentucky to be sold; likewise my
lands on Holston, at the discretion of my executors.
"2. My children to be educated in the best manner my estate will permit.
"3. My estate to be equally divided among my children.
"4. To cach of my daughters a small tract of land.
"5. My wife to keep possession of the four oldest negroes
for the maintenance of the family.
"6. My lands and slaves to be equally divided amongst my

children.
"7. I appoint my brother Isaac Bledsoe and Colonel Daniel
Smith executors, with my wife, Mary Bledsoe, executrix.
"8. At the decease of my wife, the four above negroes to be
equally divided amongst my children."
The defendants repel her claim by alleging that the word
children, in the third and sixth clauses of the will, was inserted instead of the word sons, by the mistake of the draughtsman. And out of this the first question arises, viz.: 1. Ahether parol evidence is admissible to prove the error. of
the draughtsman, and to correct it, either by inserting the
word sons instead of the word children, or by striking out the
clauses in which the word children is inserted; in which case
the lands would pass to the sons by the then law of descents
in Tennessee.
For the lessor of the plaintiff, we insist that this evidence
was erroneously admitted by the Circuit Court. And in support of this position, out of the numberless cases in the books,
we shall cite only three, one of them having the merit of being
directly in point; namely, Weatherhead v. Sewell, 9 Humphreys, 272, 303, decided.by the Supreme Court of Tennessee,
at December term, 1848, upon this very will; and the other
two, Newburgh v. Newburgh, 5 Madd. 364, and Miller v.
Travers, 8 Bingh. 244, both being closely analogous to our
case. For a classification of all the cases, see Wigram on
Wills, a treatise approved by the highest authority in England;
Doe d. Gord v. Needs, 2 Mees. & Wels. 129; 1 Spence's Eq.
554; Sugden on Property, ch. 2, §1, arts. 4,5, 9, 17; and America, 1 Greenleaf's Ev.§§ 287, 291, and notes.
Besides admitting the testimony of witnesses to alter the

346

SUPREME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

will, the Circuit Court charged the jury to consider the conjoint acts of the plaintiff and her husband, and the acts of the
other children, in instances where they all concurred in dividing the estate; and, from the partition they actually did make
amongst each other, see,.
1st How far they mutually recognized the true will to be,
that each of the daughters should have a small tract of land,
but not an equal division; and
2d. Especially, how far the plaintiff concurred in these acts
of partition, and in the mutual occupation of the lands each
devisee took.
The jury were then told, that these acts of the plaintiff in
recognition of the partition actually made, and of concurrence
and long acquiescence therein, and in the possession held accordingly, were evidence strengthened by lapse of time, that
the will was, that each of the daughters should have a small
tract of land.
This is but to say, that we are to learn what a will is, not
from the face of it, but by the glosses put upon it by contemporaries, and that we may gather those glosses -from circumstantial evidence, as well as from the direct swearing of witnesses.
2. The court next instructed the jury, that, if they believed
the facts given in evidence, then" they would be authorized to
presume that a legal partition had been made, the evidence of
which had been lost by the accidents of time; by which partition the plaintiff legally received her share of the testator's land.
Here I take the meaning of the court to be, that, supposing
the will to give her one eleventh part of the land, the jury may
presume, from the facts in evidence, that a partitipn was legally made, apsigning the plaintiff such part. .
Be it so, for the sake of argument; then the defendants are
in the adverse possession of her share in severalty, and are not
tenants in common with her; and unless they are protected by
the statute of limitations, or by lapse of time, she must recover.
But they are not protected by the statute of limitations, because the evidence shows that the adverse possession did not
commence till after her marriage, she and her" brothers having
held in common till that event.
Are they protected by lapse of time? They are, if conveyances can be presumed from' her to the defendants.
"But no case caxi be put in which such a presumption has
been made, except where a title has been shown by the party
who calls for the presumption, good in substance, but wanting
some collateral matter necessary to make it complete in point

of form. In-such cases, when the possession is shown to have
been consistent with the existence of the fact directed to be,
presumed, and in such cases only, has it ever been allowed.
Per Tindal, C. J., in Doe d. Hammond v. Cooke, 6 Bingham,
174; 1 Greenleaf's Ev. § 46.
In Doe d. Fenwick, v. Reed, 5 Barnwell and Alderson,- 232,
it appeared that, in 1752, an ancestor of the defendant had
been put in possession of the land in question as a creditor
under a judgment against the then owner, which possession
continued in the defendant and his family down to the time
of trial, in 1821, being sixty-nine years. It appeared also that
the tifle-deeds, which, however, also related to other lands, had
continued in the possession 'of the plaintiff's family, and that
moduses had been paid by them for several estates, including
some of the property in question.
Oh this evidence, Bayley, J. told the jury, that the real question for them to consider was, whether they believed tha( a
conveyance to the defendant, or those under whom he claimed,
had actually taken place; observing that the loss of a deed
was less likely to take place than of a grant of a right of way;
and that, during a portion of the period of the possession, two
of the pirties under whom the plaintiff claimed being mar,ried, no conveyance could have been made without levying a
fine, which, being of record, might have been produced if it had
existed.
The jury having found for the plaintiff, on motion for a new
trial, the whole Court of Queen's Behch concurred in refusing
the rule. Abbott, C. J., in delivering the judgment, said: "I am clearly of opinion, that the direction was according
to-law. I;n cases where the original possession cannot be accounted for, and would be inlawful, unless there had been a
grant, the rule may, perhaps, be different. Here the original
possession is accounted for, and is consistent with the fact of
there having been no conveyance.
"It may, indeed, have continued longer than is consistent
with the original condition; but it was surely a question for
the jury to say whether that continuance was to be attributed
to a want of care and attention on the part of the family under whom the plaintiff claims, or to the fact of there having
been a conveyance of the estate.. As the defendapt's ancestor
had originally a lawful possession, I think it was incumbent
on him to give stronger evidence to warrant the jury in cornin- to a corclusion that there had been a conveyance.
"As to the judge's observations respecting the fine, I think
he might properly tell the jury, that, under the circumstances,
they would probably find a fine.

348

SUPREME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

"In my opinion, presumption of grants and conveyances has
already gone too great lengths, and I am not disposed to extend it further."
Again, in the case of Doe d. Howson v. Waterton, 3 Barn.
& Aid. 149, where copyhold premises were surrendered to a
charitable use in 1743, but it did not appear that the provisions
of 9 Geo. I. c. 36, with respect to the enrolment of conveyances
to charitable uses, had been complied with, it was held, in 1819,
that is, after the lapse of seventy-six years, that the existence
of a bargain and sale, and enrolment under the statute, could
not be presumed from the possession since 1743. Lord Ten.
terden, C. J., there says :'"It is said, in this case, that the court may presume, if necessary, that a bargain and sale and enrolment have been made.
But no instance can be found where the courts have presumed
that an enrofment had been made. I am of opinion, that no
ptesumption ought to be made."
And Bayley, J., adds: "As to presuming an enrolment, if it
had appeared that the rolls of Chancery had been searched, and
a chasm had been discovered about the period of the surrender,
it might have been, sufficient. At present there is no evidence
upon which such presumption can be founded."
Now f6r the application of these cases. According to C. J.
Tindal's rule, no partition can be presumed in this case, because the defendants have not shown "a title good in substance, but wanting-spme collateral matter necessary to make
it complete in point of form." The title shown by them is
good in substance and form, being conveyances from the plain,tiff's brothers. If the defendants had shown a good deed in
substance from plaintiff's husband, signed by her, but wanting
privy examination, or words of grant or release on her part, as
in Melvin v.The Proprietors of the Locks and Canals on Merrimack Riv6r, 17 Pick. 255, 262 this collateral matter, necessary-to make the deed complete in point of form, might have
been supplied by presumption. Had the defendants produced
such a substantially good, but formally defective deed, their
possession would have been consistent with the existence of
the fact to be presumed, and then the presumption is allowable,
according to the other branch of C. J. Tindal's rule.
Further: A partition in Tennessee may be made by tnutual
conveyances where the -parties are adult "and can agree, or
where they are minors or dannot agree, by bill in chancery, or
by the summary method prescribed by the act of 1787, c. 17.
Supposing the first method to have been adopted in this
cake, the execution:6f th deed by the husband must have been
proved by two witnessesj or acknowledged by him before the

County or Circuit Court of Sumner County, and acknowledged
by the plaintiff on privy examination by the court, and minutes
of the probate or acknowledgment and privy examination entered on the record, a certificate of this indorsed on the deed
by the clerk, and then the whole recorded in the registry of
deeds for the county.
Are we to presume, in the absence of evidence, that search
has been made in vain for traces of these records; that no such
records exist; and supply the whole, at a blow, by a presumption? If so, what ought the instruction to the jury to have
been? According to the case of Doe d. F enwick v. Reed, the
court should have said to the jury: " The real question for you to consider is, whether you believe that a partition, by mutual deeds between the devisees,
actually did take place; and, as this could not be without record of the proof, or acknowledgment of the deed and privy examination of the wife, some traces of which records .probably
exist, you should not presume the deed in the absence of e idence that such traces are not to be found. And the court is
of this opinion, because the original possession of the defendants can be accounted for in this case without making the presumption in question, and was lawful, though no such partition
was made."
If a partition by mutual conveyances ought not to be presumed in such circumstances, much less ought a partition by
bill in equity; or by the summary proceeding prescribed by the
statute, to be presumed. In the absence of the evidence of a
search, without success, for any of those records, it is impossible to presume them. 3 Barn. & Ald. 149; Best cn Presumptions of Law and Fact, §§ 39, 40, -in 37 Law Lib. 47, 49.
But in this case the adverse possession commenced after the
plaintiff's coverture. Now, in McCorry v. King's Heirs, 3
Humphreys, 267, 278, it appeared that George Gillespie, the
grantee of the lands in question, on the 14th of December,
1793, devised in his will as follows: "I give and bequeathe to
my well-beloved daughter, Jane Gillespie, her heirs a nd assigns
for ever, the tract of land I bought of James and Charles
McCartney, lying in Green County." After the death of the
devisor, Jane, the devisee, married William King, by whom
she had children, the lessors of the plaintiff. In 1803 King,
without his wife in any manner joining him therein, conveyed
to Hayworth the land sued for. In 1804 Hayworth conveyed
to Copeland, and he in 1809 to McCorry, the defendant. Jane
King, the devisee, died in January, 1828, and William King,
her husband, in October, 1835, and on the 4th of February,
1837, the children of Jane and William King commenced an.

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

ejectment against MeCorry -to recover the lands which he had
possessed under the deed made by their father for thirty-four
years. Upon this state of facts the court say :" It is insisted that th6.jury should have been instructed
that they might presume, from the length of possession in this
case, that the wife had properly conveyed; that her ancestor, the testator, had made a deed, or the State issued an
older grant to the defendant, or to those under whom he
claims. We aie of opinion, that the -judge of the Circuit
Court, presiding at the trial, very properly Nithheld such instruction.
"When the circumstances of the case, the relation of the parties towards each other, or the condition of the title, obviate
and repel the bar of the statute, we think it would be wrong in
principle, and unsupported by precedent, to protect the possession by giving effect to the doctrine of presumption insisted on.
It would operate, moreover, most unjustly. A4 tenant in dower
might alien in fee, and live for sixty or seventy years afterwards.
The heir could not enter or sue during her life, and the statute
would not operate in favor of the alienee until seven years had
elapsed after the death of the tenant in dower. Yet, if the
doctrine of presumption was applied to the case, the alienee
would have a good title in fee, not by the deed he had taken,
but by another presumed in his favor for more than twenty
years before the death of the doweress. The truth is, the
doctrine of presumption, as- well as the bar created by the
policy of the statute, is founded upon the principle of laches in
him who, having the 'ight, power, and capacity to sue, and
disturb, or recover possession i fqr a long time omifs. and neglects to do so.
"This doctrine, under such circumstances, to secure the-repose
of society, presumes, at length, that he who could and would
not sue had parted with his right. But to presume against
him who is unable to sue, whose right of action has not accrued, who has been guilty of no laches, that his titie has
passed fron him, or from those uncher whom he claims, would
be an application of the doctrihe of presumption as novel, we
think, as it Would be mischievous. The husband sells the land
of the wife ana conveys in fee; the coverture continues for
fifty years afterwaids; the wife survives; she is within the saving of the statute; she brings her suit, and is told that the title
has long since been lost by the presumption of a valid conveynce from her. Certainly this could not be tolerated."
So the Supreme Court of New Ham shlr6; after remarking
that the doctrine of presuming a deed from^long possession
and acquiescence, has been established, in analogy to 'the pro-

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

351

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et aL

visions of the statute of limitations, proceed to say, that, where a
husband undertakes 'to convey land in fee, of which he is seized
only in right of his wife, in such a case no presumption of a
grapt can be raised against the wife by her acquiescence during
coverture, because she is nnt in a situation, and has no power,
to interfere and avoid the act of her husband; and if she could,
it might be his interest to prevent het. 4 N. Hamp. 327, 328,
in the case of Barnard v. Edwards.
So in the case of the Lessee of Margaret Dblancey v.
McKeen, 1 Wash. C. C. 354, the lessor of the plaintiff, having survived her husband, sued for one hundred acres of land,
part of a tract of one thousand acres that had been conveyed
to her and her husband in 1771, by Williain Allen, her
father. The defendant set up a title under a deed from the
commissioners of forfeited estates, who sold the same as part
of the estate of Andrew Allen, a son of William Allen, and
brother of the plaintiff, he having been regularly attainted. His
estates were sold in 1778, and the deed executed in 1779. The
defendant proved that, in 1775, Andrew Allen entered into
contracts for the sale of parcels of this land; that he offered
the whole tract, including the one hundred acres sued for by
plaintiff, for sale; that he received the consideration money for
such parcels as he had sold; that these payments 'were made,
sometimes to himself, sometimes to William Allen for his use;
that, at one time, the plaintiff was in the room wnen a sum for
part of the land was paid by the purchaser.
For the defendant it was urged, thai these acts of ownership
by Andrew Allen were sufficient to authorize the jury to presume a conveyance from- Delancey and the plaintiff, his wife,
to Andrew Allen, or, at any rate,. an agreement to sell, which
W-%,ould be sufficient to pass an equitable estate to. Andrew
Allen; upon which, as well as upon legal estates, the act of
confiscation operated.
To this Judge Washington answered: " The acts of owner.
ship by Andrew Allen, set up as a title for the defendant, prove
nothing against the plaintiff, who labored under two disabilities, coverture and absence beyond seas, until the year 1780 or
1781, when the joint estate vested in her by survivorship."
It is true that Judge Story, in Tyler v. Williamson, 4 Mason,
402, does say, that "the presumption is applied as a presumption juris et de jure, whenever by possibility a right may be
acquired in any manner known to the law." And he adds;
"Its operation has never yet been denied in cases where personal disabilities of particular proprietors might have intervened, such as infancy, coverture, and insanity, and, by the.
ordinary course of proceeding, grants would not be presumed.P-

But Angell, in his work on Adverse Enjoyment (p. 116), says:
"Persons who labor under a disability, it would seem, are pro.
tected against the common effect of the rule under consideration, inasmuch as they are excepted in the statute in analogy
to which the rule was established. Besides, as a prescriptive
right is founded upon the supposition of a grant, it cannot be
opposed to those whom the law does not allow to have the
control and administration of their property." And in-Watkins
v. Peck, 13 N. Hamp. 377, the Supreme Court say, "that,
notwithstanding the above remark of Judge Story, we are of
opinion that no grant can be presumed from an adverse use of
an easement in the land of another, foy the term of twenty
years, where the owner of the land was, at the expiration of
the twenty years, and long before, incapable of making a grant,
whether the disability arose from infancy or insanity." " Perhaps," they add, "a disability intervening during the lapse of
the term, but not extending to the termination of the period
of twenty -years, might not be sufficient to rebut the presumption ; but it would be absurd to presume a grant, where it was
clear that no such grant could have existed." The Supreme
Court of New York, too, 16 Johns. 214, in Bailey v,. Jackson,
even say, "that this is not like a statute bar, which having
once begun to run will continue, notwithstanding a subsequent disability occurs."
Be this as it may, these citations are enough to show that
Judge Story's remark is not supported, unless this presumption
be, as he says in that place, a presumption juris el dejure; or
unless, as Lord Mansfield said, 4 Burr. 2023, quiet possession
alone, for twenty years, be a "flat answer"; or, as Eyre, C. J.,
in I Bos. & Pul. 400, 5tyled it, &"complete answer, or bar to
the action." This is to confound the-well-established distinction between conclusive and-rebutable presumptions, and to
put the latter upon the same footing as prescription and the
statute of lim'itations. Greenleaf's Evidence, § 46. And it is
to be observed that Professor Greenleaf cites the case of Tyler
v. Wilkinson, where he is treating of the title by prescription.
Ev. § 17.
Finally, upon this point, inasmuch as presumptions .of this
kind are in truth but mere arguments, and depend upon their
own natural force and efficacy in generating belief or conviction,in the mind (Greenleaf's Bv. § 44), the charge should have
been, as already suggested, in the words, substantially, of Bayley, J., in Fenwick's Lessee v. Reed, to wit: "The real question
for the jury to consider is, whether they believe that a conveyance to the defendant, or those under whom he claims, was
actually made." Whereas, in thi5 case, the jury were told, that,

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

353

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

"if they believed the facts given in evidence, they would be
authorized to presume that a legal partition had been made,"
&c.; and were left to infer, that, after presuming a p ition,
they could also go on to presume a conveyance from. the
plaintiff to the defendants, or to those under whom they
claim.
3. But whatever the law of other Stites or countries may be,
certainly the Supreme Court of Tennessee has declared the
law of that State to be, that the evidence in question is inadraissible, and that the presumption called for by the defendants
cannot be made. Weatherhead v. Sewell, 9 Humph. 272;
McCorry v. King's Heirs, 3 Hurmph. 267.
"There are certain rules of evidence which may be affirmed to
be generally, if not universally, recognized. Thus, in relation to
immovable property, inasmuch as the rights and titles thereto
are generally admitted to be governed by the law of the situs,
and as suits and controversies touching the same, ex directo,.
properly belong to the forum of the situs, and not elsewhere, it
would seem a just and natural, if not an irresistible conclusion,
that the law of evidence of the situs touching such rights, titles,
suits, and controversies must and ought exclusively to govern
in all such cases. So, in cases relating to the due execution
of .wills and testaments of immovables, the proofs must and
ought to be according to the law of the situs." Story, Conft.
of Laws, § 630 b.
" And perhaps it may be stated as a general truth, that the
admission of evidence and the rules of evidence are rather
matters of procedure than matters attaching to the rights and
titles of parties under contracts, deeds, and other instruments;
and therefore they are to be governed by the law of the country where the court sits." Ibid. § 634 a.
Therefore, whether we regard the law of evidence touching
titles to immovables as a part of the law of titles, or as part of
the law of procedure, either way the law of Tennessee must
prevail, and the charge of the Cjrcuit Court was erroneous.
1r. Fogg, for defendants in error.
The acts of Assembly of the State of Tennessee in regard to
wills of land are those of April, 1784, c. 22, and October, 1784,
c. 10, § 6. Probates of wills in the County Court are sufficient
testimony of the devise of real estate, and attested copies may
be given in evidence in the same manner as the originals; but
the original will must be produced under the requisitions of the
proviso of the sixth section of the act of October, 1784. The
probate of the paper writing called the will of Anthony Bledsoe before the County Court of Sumner, in October, 1788, was

We-atlierhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et

in common form, where the devisees and next of kin hd no
notice. Redmond v. Collins, 4 Devereux, 430-449. The mode
in which the probate was made in the County Court is not
stated. The statement of General Hall as to the declarations
of Isaac Bledsoe, the executor, and his wife, which the General
had communicated to Rogan, and which Rogan said was cor-rect, was properly received before the original will was produced. If the plaintiff had only offered the original, and
proved Rogan's handwriting, then probably the defendants
could not have attacked his testimony; but with the copy, the
plaintiff relied upon his evidence. He was not only a subscribing witness, but a witness who was sworn before the County
Court, and stated, as is to be inferred, that he became a subscribing Witness, in the presence of the testator and at his request, to this paper as his will, and that this was his will, when
he knew what the instructions were. If he had been present
to be cross-examined, the fact could have been shown by himself; as he Was dead, it is shown by his own declarations to
Hall that he contradicted the idea that this was the will of
Bledsoe, and thereby the effect of the probate was in some degree impaired, although in a slight degree,'and was proper to
be submitted to the jury. The defendants held in their own
right, by deeds of conveyance purporting to pass the legal
title; they did not claim under the will. Blight's Lessee
v. Rochester, 7 Wheaton, 535. This paper writing is introduced to show that the land sued for was devised to Mrs.
Weatherhead, and that thereby she had a title to the same.
The animus testandi, the design and intention that the particular paper should be the last will and testament of the deceased,
is the great and essential requisite of a will. In a court of construction, the intention of the testator, as collected from a view
of the whole instrument, is the guide to its correct exposition;
so, in determining thefactun of the will, the aninius testandi is
to be gathered from the whole circumstances of the case. In
the words of Sir John Nichol in Zacharias v. Colis, 3 Philimore, 179, "the factum of an instrument means not barely the
signing f it, and the formal publication or delivery, but proof
that he well knew and understood the contents thereof, and
did 'give, will, dispose, and do in all things as in the said will
is contained." It is not pretended that parol evidence can be
admitted to contradict or vary the ter~ms of a will, or to explain
its meaning, except in cases of a latent ambiguity. This cannot be done by a court of law or equity, acting as a court
of construction. Greenleaf on Evidence, § 275 et seq. But
though you cannot resort to parol evidence to control the effect
of words or expressions which the testator has used, by showing

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

355

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

that he used them under mistake or misapprehension, nor to
supply words which he has not used, yet you may, upon an
issue of devisavit.vel non, prove that clauses or expressions have
been inadvertently introduced into the will contrary to the testator's intention and instructions, or, in other words, that a part
of the executed instrument was not his will. 1 Jarman on
Wills, 354, 355, et seq. Hippesley v. Homer, Turn. & Russ.
48, note. The remarks of Sir John Leach in the case of
Earl of Newburg v. Countess of Newburg, 5 Maddock, 361. 1
Greenleaf, § 284. In order to ascertain whether the land in
controversy was devised to Mrs. WVeatherhetd, and whether
this was the last will of the testator, it is right to consider
all the circumstances constituting the res geste at the time of
the execution of the paper. I Greenleaf, § 108. In Smith v.
Fenner, I Gallison, 170, the declarations of the testator before
and at the time of making a will, and afterwards, if so near as
to be a part of the res gest, were admitted to show fraud in
obtaining the will. In the case of Reel v. Reel, 1 Hawks, N. C.
248, it was decided that evidence was admissible of the declarations of a testator made at any time subseqlient to the execution of the will, which went to show that the testator believed
the contents of the will to be different from what they really
are; or declarations by testator of any other circumstances
which show that it is not his will are admissible. The sam.
point was decided in the case of Howell v. Barden, 3 Devereux,
442; Hester v. Hester, 4 Devereux, 228. See also Mathews
v. Warner, 4 Yes. jr. 186 to 210; Small v. Allen, 8 Duinf. &
East, 147. The decision of the Supreme Court of Tennessee
in Weatherhead v. Sewell et al., 9 Humphreys, 272, we contend, with great deference, proceeds upon the doctrine of refusing parol evidence to explain or add to a will in a case of
construction, and does not apply to receiving evidence to show
that no will ever existed. The evidence offered and received
in this cause by the Circuit Court was legal evidence to show
that there was no devise to complainant of an equal share of
the land of Anthony Bledsoe, and the jury had a right to draw
the conclusion that there was iio will to that effect. The possession by defendants was for more than forty years, and none
of the daughters or their husbands, as devisees, ever claimed
under the will according to what is now contended for the
plaintiff.
2dly. The Circuit Court did not err in their instructions
to the jury upon the law of presumption. This question of
presumption did not arise at all in the case decided in 9
Humphreys, before mentioned. The doctrine of presumption has been frequently discussed in the courts of Tennessee.

356

SUPREME

COVRT.

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

See Haines v. Peck's Lessee, Martin & Yerger, 228 to 237.
Long-continued uninterrupted possession shall be left to a
jury, as a ground upon-which they may presume that deeds,
grants, records, writings, facts, &c., which cannot now be produced, had formerly a legal existence. See I Meigs's Digest,
p. 488, § 920, and cases there cited. Also, Chilton v. Wilson,
9 Humphreys, 4399; Rogers v. Mabe, 4 Devereux, 188. In
these cases, the defendants have had an adverse possession of
more than forty years; partitions of the land sued for were
made near fifty years before the suit was brought; the daughters and their husbands have had several possessions of the
parts assigned to them, and large and valuable improlements
have been made by defendants, and those under whom they
claim, and the value of the land has increased near a hundredfold. David Shelby, who married one of the daughters, and
who, in 1794, was guardian of Mrs. Weatherhead, and gave
in her part of this land for taxes, was a man of great sagacity
and intelligence, and clerk of the County Court of Sumner
for more than thirty years. He never for himself claimed, nor
did his wife after his death ever claim, any of the land except
that which was assigned to her of the tract in controversy.
Plaintiff and her husband lived on a part of this tract for near
twenty years, and saw the other part claimed by strangers,
who were making valuable improvements. - In addition to all
this, the records of the District Court of Mero were destroyed
by fire in 1796, that being the court where bills for partition
and settlement of estates of dedeased persons would have been
filed. Deeds of partition have been presumed in much less
time. 5 Cranch, 262; 3SPhillips on Evidenlce, 357; 5 Monroe,
518; 3 Desaussure, 555; 2 Gill & Johns. 468. To this doctrine the only answer'is, that lMvfrs. Weatherhead was a feme
covert until 1843, and therefore the law of presumption does
not apply. A married woman in England formerly could not
make a deed, but could convey only by fine, which is matter
of record. In this country she can convey by deed and private
examination, which deed can be lost or destroyed, or she may
be bound by partition ordered by a court of chancery, the records of which have been burned and destroyed. In Bunce v.
Wolcott, 2 Connecticut, 27, one of the judges in delivering
his opinion says.: "Upon the point of presumption, I do not
know that it is entitled to any weight. The feme covert and
.her husbahd were capable of conveying the property, it was
their interest to do it on sufficient consideration, and the facts
in this case warrant the presumption of 'their having done it."
In Melvin v. Locks and Canals, 17 Pick. 255, the jury were
allowed to presume, from certain facts and circumstances, that

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

a married woman had with her husband. conveyed land, and
that was in a case where, so far as appeared, the husband
alone had conveyed.
In Barnard v. Edwards, 4 N. Hamp. 321, a right of dower
accrued to a widow in 1797, who neglected to make any
claim of dower until 1826; such neglect was held to be competent evidence to be submitted to a jury as proof of a re-,
lease of the right, although she married again in 1798, and
remained a feme covert during the residue of the time, and had
resided out of the State during the whole time. Also Tyler v.
Wilkinson, 4 Mason, 402.
In the Circuit Court, the case of MeCorry v. King's Heirs, 3
Humphreys, 267, was cited to show that the principles of presumptive evidence would not apply*to a feme covert, and it
could not be presumed she had executed a deed. In that case
the husband made a conveyance of the lands of the wife, she
not joining therein. There the husband had estopped himself
from suing, and the wife could not sue alone. The possession
of the husband's vendee was consistent with, and subordinate
to, the right of the wife and that of her heirs; the possession
of the tenant for life was the possession of the remainder-man,
and there was no adverse possession. See Guion v. Anderson,
8 Humphreys, .327. In the present case, Mr. Weatherhead,
her husband, made no deed, and the defendants do not claim
under him. That case therefore has no application, and where
the facts and circumstances concur, a presumption can as well
be made in the case of a feme covert as of one sui juris. On
the doctrine of presumptions, see Augell on Limitations, 425
to 429; Greenleaf on Evidence, §§ 44, 45, et seq.
M r. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
All of us agree - our learned brother who presided upon the
trial of this case in the Circuit Court concurring-that so
much of the testimony submitted to the jury, to show a different intention in the testator from that which his will discloses,
was inadmissible. Wreatherbead v. Sewell, 9 Humph. 272;
Newburgh v. Newburgh, 5 Madd. 864; Miller v. Travers, 8
Bingh. 244; 1 Greenleaf oi Evidence, 287, 289, and note. .
But it was urged, as the animus testandi of a testator may
be gathered from all the circumstances constituting the res
gestc of the execuion of a will, that all and any of them
may be used to prove thaet expressions and clauses were put
into the will we are considering, contrary to the intention and
instructions of the testator. Without denying altogether that
proposition, or the illustration of it in the case of Hippesley
v. Homer, Turn. & Russ. 48, we think it must be admitted,,

358

SUPRIME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et al.

that the testimony for such a purpo se must be of facts unconnected with any general declaration, or wishes expressed by a
testator for the disposition of his property by will. Strode v.
Lady Faulkland, 3 Ch. 129; Brown v. Selwin, Cas. Temp
Talb. 240. The only safe rule is, that, where a will is doubtful and uncertain, it must receive its construction from the
words of the will itself, and no parol proof or declaration
ought to be admitted out of the will to ascertain it. The testimony offered- in this case. is of that character. That which
was offered is the testimony of Hall and Ma Read. Hall's
in this particular is a hearsay narrative received by him from
the executor, Isaac Bledsoe. On that account it will not be
further noticed. Mary Read's is not admissible, for she a4mits that she did not hear what the testator said 1"w hen the
-will was writing, if he said any thing." She does not say that
she heard the instructions given by the testator to Clendening,
the draughtsman of the will. But she says "she recollects he
said he wanted his Kentucky and Holston lands sold, and the
proceeds applied .to the education of his children; that he wanted a small tract of land given to his daughters at the discretion
of his executors; the balance of his land to be equally divided
among his sons." Such testimony is altogether inadmissible,
either for the purpose of determining the factum of a will, or
to ascertain its intention. "It would indeed be of but little
avail to require that a will ab orgine should be in writing, or to
fence a testator round with a guard of attesting witnesses, if,
when the written instrument failed to make a full and explicit
disclosure of his scheme of disposition, its deficiencies might
be supplied and its inaccuracies might be corredted from extrinsic sources." In another view her testimony was ihadmissible. There is no such uncertainty in the will, that it cannot
be' carried into effect without the aid of extrinsic testimony.
Those words which are supposed to make it so, being void and
inoperative to convey any thing, when that has been determined, cannot be used to make something else in the will ambiguous, which is certain of itself. The words are, 1'to each of
my daughters a small tract of land," immediately after the
testator's declaration that he desired his estate to be equally
divided among his children. Estate is a comprehensive term,
including all real and personal estate, and children has a legal
significancy, extending, as the ease may be, to grandchildren
and even illegitimate children, but never permitting the term
sons to be substituted for it, unless such shall be the plain intention of a testator in his, will in favor of sons to the exclusion
of daughters. Again, the testator says iathe will, "my lands
and slaves to be equally divided amongst my children." In

DECEMBER TERM, 1850.

359

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et dl.

both the terms are intelligible. They do not admit of a doubt,
and must have their operation, notwithstanding there may be
an intermediate expression without any legal efficacy or certain meaning. We do not think it necessary to examine further, in. connection with this case, how far parol evidence is
admissible in cases of wills; or for what ambiguities in a will
extrinsic testimony may be used to explain them. The case
does not call ior either. In 1 Jarman, 349, ch. 13, will be
found a clear and satisfactory chapter upon the admissibility
of parol testimony in cases of wills, illustrated by adjudicated
cases. Mr. Wigram has placed before the profession the subject
of extrinsic testimony in cases of ambiguity in wills with such
ability and minuteness, that it has become a treatise of authority with judges and lawyers in England and the United States.
We will now pass on to the instructions which the court
gave to the jury, concerning those -presumptions which they
might make from the evidence, against the plaintiff, in consequence of her supposed acquiescence in what is called a partition of the testator's lands; and that they might also presume
that it had been done by the order of a competent tribunal.
In respect to the first, it must be remembered that the plaintiff
was an infant when her father died, a minor when she married, and continued covert until within a short time before she
brought this suit. Under such circumstance of disability to
pursue her rights in her father's estate with the aid of the law,
no presumption can rightly be made against her. The rule in
such a case is, that, when a person is under a legal incapacity
to litigate a right in a court of justice, and there has been no
relinquishment of it by contract, a release of it cannot be
p _,sumed from circumstances over which the person has had
no control, happening before the incapacity to sue has been removed. It is a general rule, having however a particular bearing in favor of married women, from the relations in which
they are placed to property, and the legal disabilities resulting
from coverture. It is not necessary to enumerate the latter.
One of them is, that she cannot sue, without the assent and
association of her husband, for any property which she owns,
or to which she may become entitled in any of the ways in
which that may occur. For this cause it is, that statutes of
limitation do not run against them during coverture. The
plaintiff here was protected by that of the State of Tennessee.
No presumption could be made to defeat its protection, from
any.conduct imputed to her, or from her husband and herself
having had for any length of time a part of the testator's
lands in their possession, or from any sale made of it by her
husband in which she may have joined. The law will pre-

360

SUPREME COURT.
Weatherhead's Lessee v. BaskervilIe et al.

sume it to have been done under the coercion of her husband.
The fact mostly relied upon for the presumption, which the
jury were told they might make, was her having united with
her husband in making a sale to her brother of the land put
into their possession by her fatl'er's executor, and that she subsequently acknowledged it when discovert. The last was no
more than a correct avowal that it had been done, and that
the deed was operative for so much of the land as it conveyed
of that larger portion to which .she was entitled out of her
father's estate. Her brother, who had received a larger portion,
knew very well with whom he was dealing, and the evidence
shows that he could not have bought without knowing his
sister's discontent with the division which had been made of
the estate; and that her rights were only not asserted, to thq
extent of them, against himself and her other brothers, because
she had no one to do for her, and could not then do for herself.
We think that the exception taken to this part of the instructions must be maintained, and it is so,.by this court.
The point still to be noticed is so much of the instruction
given to the jury, informing them that they might presume
om the evidence that there had been a legal partition of the
testator's land in respect to his daughters by order of a court,
when the executor assigned them certain parts of it. By the
law of Tennessee, such a partition is a judicial act and becomes a record. It can only be proved as such records may
be, and when it is alleged to have been lost or destroyed, its
contents can only be reached by proofs of a certain and fixed
kind well known in the law. In the proper sense of the term
presutmed, the records, of courts are never so. The existence
of an ancient record of another kind may sometimds be established by presumptive evidence. But that is not done
without very probable proof that it once existed, and until its
loss is satisfactorily accounted for. The rule in respect to judicial records is, that,7before inferior evidence can be received
of their contents, their existence and loss must be clearly accounted for. It must be shown that there was such a record,
that it has been lost or destroyed, or is otherwise incapable of
being produced; or that its mutilation from time or accident.
has made it illegible. In this last, though, not without the
production of the original in the condition in which it may be.
The inferior evidence to establish the existence of a judicial
record must be something bfficially connected with it, such as
the journals of the court, or some other entry, though short of
the judgment or record, which shows that it has been judicially
made. The burning of an office and of its records is no proof
that a particular record had ever existed. It only lays the

DECEMBER TERM, 1,850.

881

Weatherhead's Lessee v. Baskerville et aL

foundation for the inferior evidence. If that cannot be got, the
result must be, and is, that there has been an allegation of the
existence of a record, without proof. There is no way of
bringing it to the knowledge of others...Nor can it be said to
be known certainly by him who asserts it. In this case, without any such proof, the jury was told that they might infer
from the burning of the records 6f the county of Mero, and the
conduct of the parties interested in-theestator's lands, that
there had been a partition according to law. If the instruetion is put exclusively upon the want of pioof to justify it# it
could not:be maintained. But it was contrary to the positive
proof in the record. There is proof that the lands assigned to
the daughters of the testator had been done by their uncle and
their father's executor, without any legal order- f 'partition.
Hall says Isaac Bledsoe, the executor, laid off the land-to the
four daughters of the testator in 1793.We will give his
words. " About the time that Isaac Bledsoe was about to lay
off the land to the four oldest daughters, witness was prepent
to wit, in 1793; and witness asked him wbat he considered
would be a small tract of land under the wlli, when Colonel
Bledsoe observed to him, that less than 320 acres woul. .nqt
make a good plantation, and that he iritended to.give his own
daughters 320 acres each; and that he intended to alsign to
his brother's daughters 320 acres of the best of the land out of
the Greenfield survey, and dbne so." The proof is pQsitive,
that the portions of that survey subsequently occupied by the
daughters and their husbands were assigned to them by the
executor upon his owii construction of the will, and without
any order for a partition by any court.. It repels all contrary
Inferences from any other evidence in the case.
We have sought to put this case upon the plainest footing
in the shortest way, and without much which might have
been written in support of our conclusion, from an unwilling
ness to embarrass it with what raight have been proper, but
which is not necessary.
The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed.
