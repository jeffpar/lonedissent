must be
AFFIRMED.

CREIGHTON V. ]KERR.
A withdrawal, " without prejudice to the plaintiff," of a general appearance
entered by an attorney, for the defendant, means that the position of
the plaintiff is not to be unfavorably affected by the act of withdrawal ;
that all his rights are to remain as they then stood. Hence where there
has been error in the beginning of an action, as ex. gr., one of foreign
attachment, by reason of want of notice required by statute to be given,
to the defendant, and an attorney appears generally for such defendant,
and so cures the defect, the advantage thus given to the plaintiff is not
taken away by a withdrawal declared to be "without prejudice" to
him. And the court states that it does not intend to intimate Lhat the
result would have been different had the appearance been withdrawn
unconditionally.

ERROR to the Supreme Court of the Territory of Colorado;
the case being thus:

The statutes of Colorado relating to attachments enact:
"SECTION 54. Whenever a plaintiff in any civil action pending
in any court of record in this Territory shall file in the office of
the clerk of the court wherein such cause is pending, an affidavit
showing that the defendant resides out of this Territory, it shall
be the duty of the clerk to cause a notice to be published in
some newspaper, published in the county in which such cause
is pending, for four successive weeks prior to the next term of
the court, which n'otice shall set forth and state the title of the
court in which such action is pending, the nature of the action,
and, if such action shall be brought to recover money, the
amount claimed by the plaintiff, the names of the parties, and
the time when, and the place where, the next term, of court in
which such action i3 pefiding will be held, and that if the defendants shall fail to appear at the term of court, and plead or
demur, judgment shall be entered by default.

CREIGHTON V. KIERR.

Statement of the case.

"SECTION 55. It shall be the duty of the plaintiff, in all cases
in which such notice shall be published, in addition to such publication, . . . if upon diliget inquiry the place where the de.

fendant may then be found can be ascertained, to send to such
defendant, and to each of them, by. mail, a true copy of such
notice, properly addressed to such defendant, at the post-office
nearest to the place where such defendant may be found, at
least thirty days prior to the term of court mentioned in such
notice."

This statute being in force, Kerr and another, in May,
1870, sued Creighton in the District Court for Arapahoe
County, illColorado Territory, in attachment. They filed
an affidavit, alleging Creighton's non-residence, and that he
owed them $5563.
The sheriff returned that he had attacbed certain shares
in the Colorado National Bank, belonging to Creighton,
who was not found.
The plaintiffs then filed their declaration, claiming $8000.
No notice of these proceedings was published as required
by the statutes.
Subsequently an entry was made in the court as follows:
"Now come the said plaintiffs, by Alfred Sayre, Esq., their
attorney, and the said defendant, by Messrs. Charles and Elbert,
his attorneys, also comes, and thereupno, on motion of said
plaintiff's attorney, the said defendant was ruled to plead ten
days from this date."
On the 19th of October the following:
"And now on this day come kessrs. Charles and Elbert and
withdraw their appearance as attorneys for the said defendant,
without prejudice to the plaintiff."
On the 27th of October a judgment was entered, reciting
the appearance, its withdrawal "by leave of the court and
without prejudice to said plaintiffs;" and the defendant's
failure to plead according to the rl1e. Damages were assessed by a jury dt $12,244. A remillitur was entered for
$4244, and judgment taken foi $8000. The Supreme Court
affirmed this judgment, and the defendant brought the case
here.

CREIGHTON V. KERR.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

Mr. .". M. Woolworth, for the plaintiff in error:
I. If we lay out of view the appearance which Charles
and Elbert entered for Creighton, it is obvious that this
judgment cannot be sustained for a moment, because1. No notice of the proceedings was published, nor mailed
to the defendant, both of which things the statute 'render
necessary. If neglected, a judgment may not be collaterally
avoided, but on error it must be reversed.
2. The writ of attachment by which the suit was brought
is for only $5563, and the affidavit on which the writ is
issued alleged only that sum to be due. It was not competent for tho court to. render a judgment for more than was
specified in the writ. '
II. The fact that Mr. Creighton appeared generally in the
action, does not affect the case.
Had the withdrawal of the appearance been general, and
unqualified by the words "without prejudice to the plaintiff." the case would have stood; as if no appearance had been
entered.* The words "without prejudice," do not retain to
the plaintiff the. advantage of the appearance. To give to
them lat effect would make of no effect the withdrawal.
Theutmu ' meaning that can be attributed to them is, that
the progress ' the cause, and at rights of the plaintiff not
resting on the a2oearance, should remain unaffected by the
withdrawal.
.

Mr. B. T. 'Merrick, contra.
Mr. Justice HUNT delivered the opinion of the court.
In the view we take of this case it is not necessary to examine the alleged irregularities ifi the conduct of the suit
or the alleged 'defects in its commencement. Without intending, in fact, to decide those points, it may be assumed,
as is argued by the plaintiff in error, that there was not that
notice of the proceedings required by the laws of Colorado.

OREIGHTON V. KERR.
Opinion of the court.

It may be assumed also that in making a claim of damages
for $5563 only in the writ of attachmint, and in making a
claim for $8000 in the declaration, an error was committed.
It is insisted that in consequence of this claim in the writ
the party would have been justified in assuming that no
judgment for a larger amount would be taken against him;
and that great injustice might have been done to him. We
do not find that the respectable counsel claims that any injustice has actually been done.
But we are of the opinion that there has been no opportunity for the commission of injustice. We find the facts
in this re~pec to be as follows:
After the execution of the writ of attachment the plaintiff filed his declaration claiming damages to the amount of
$8000, giving the items of the claim. After this time, viz.,
on the 12th day of October, the defendant appeared in the
suit by his counsel, Mess's. Charles and Elbert. The appearance was general, and, "thereupon," as the record says,
on motion of the plaintiff's attorney, the defendant was
ruled to plead in ten days.
Within the ten days, in which an order to plead had been
entered, upon, or upon the faith of, or in consequence of
their appearance, the attorneys came into court and withdrew their appearance as attorneys .for the defendant, without "prejudice to the plaintiff." Leave to withdraw was
granted upon this condition. Assuming the rule to plead
to have been effectual, as.it manifestly would have been
had there been no withdrawal, and assuming that a failure
to comply therewith placed the defendant in default, and
entitled the plaintiff to a judgment by nil dicit, as would
manifestly have been the case had there been no withdrawal,
the plaintiff and the court held the action to be undefended,
and a judgment was entered for the plaintiff, with damages
to be assessed by a jury to be impanelled. The jury received evidence upon this subject, and uunder instructions
from the court rendered a verdict for $12,244. The evidence is not returned in the record, as there was no occasion
that it should be, and there is no presumption of law, or

Opinion of the court.

reason in fact, to suppose that the verdict was for a larger
sum than was justly due to the plaintiff. For all in excess
of $8000 a remission was made, and judgment was entered
for that sum.
The leave to withdraw the appearance of the defendant's
attorneys was given. upon the condition that it should be
-" without prejudice to the plaintiff."
This meant that the
position of the plaintiff was not to be unfavorably affected
by the act of vfithdrawal. All his rights were to remain as
they then stood.
A general appearance waives all question 6f the service
of process. It is equivalent to a personal service. The
question of jurisdiction only is saved.* If there was error
in the commencement of this action by reason of a defective
notice or otherwise, it was cured by the appearance.
This advantage, among others, was not to be impaired by
the withdrawal of the appearance.
A personal appearance by the defendant, through his attorneys, converted into a personal suit that which was before
a proceeding in rem. This result had been worked when
the appearande was entered, and stood in full effect when
the withdrawal was made;. Any judgment that he could
then obtain against the defendant was binding upon the defendant, indisputable and valid against him and his property
wherever he or it could be found. To reconstruct this judgment and by means of a withdrawal of the appearance make
it a judgment to be enforced upon certain shares of bank
stock only, and liable to be re-examined as to that upon the
personal application of the defendant, would produce an extremely unfavorable effect upon the plaintiff's position. It
Would be a "prejudice" to him, and hence it cannot be permitted.
A rule to plead had been served upon the attorneys. This
remained in force. A-t the expiration of the time to plead
the action was undefended, and a right to an interlocutory
judgment at once arose. To take aWay this right would be

Opinion of the court.

an injury to the plaintiffi Hence under the condition of no
prejudice it remained good to him.
The appearance of the defendant may remain, although
the attorneys, by whom it was entered, have withdr'awn.
Its effect cannot be annulled by such'withdrawal. The appearance gives rights and benefits in the conduct of a suit,
to destroy which by a withdrawal would work great injustice to the other party. Such was the case of Eldred v.
Bank,* where the defendant withdrew his plea, claiming
that the withdrawal left the case as though it had never been
filed, and that, never having been served with process, he
was not liable to a personal judgment. The court say:
"We do not agree to this proposition. The filing of the
plea was both an appearance and a defence. The withdrawal of the plea could not have the effect of withdrawing
the appearance of the defendant, and requiring the plaintiff
to take steps to bring him again within the jurisdiction of
the court. . . He was not by the withdrawal of the plea
out of court."
None of the cases cited contain anything in hostility to
these views. As confirming them see Lawrence v. Yealnian,t
Rowley v. Berrian,T Thompson v. Turner.§
Second. We do not intend by the argument thus advanced to intimate that the result would have been different
'had the appearance been withdrawn unconditionally, as was
the case in -Eldred v. Bank.
• The authorities upon this subject of a voluntary appearance are cited in the case of i-abich v. _Folger, recently decided in this court,J and it is not necessary to do more than
to refer to them as there collected.
In the present case there was not a simple withdrawal,
but it was allowed upon the condition that it should be
without prejudice to the position of the plaintiff. We decide the case upon the facts as they are presented, and

nothing would be gained by attempting to go beyond
them.
JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Mr. Justice BRADLEY did not sit during the argument,
and took no part in this decision.

MCQUIDDY V. WARE.
1. A man who has neglected his private affairs and gone away from his
home and State, for the purpose of divoting his time to the cause of rebellion against the government, cannot come into-equity to complain
that his creditors have obtained payment of admitted debts through
judicial process obtained upon constructive notice, and on a supposition
wrongly made by them that he had no home in the State, or none that
they knew of.
2. Especially is this true when there is rio allegation of want of actual knowledge of what they were doing.
8. And still more especially true is it in Missouri, where the statntes of the
State allow a bill of review of decrees or judgments obtained on constructive notice at any time within three years after they are obtained,
and the complainant has let more tbhn six years pass without an effort
to have them so reviewed.
4. Allegations of general ignorance of things a knowledge of which is easily
ascertainabl6, is insufficient to set into action the remedies of equity.
APPEAL from the-Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri; the case being thus:
At the beginning of the late rebellion, which broke out
in 1861, McQuiddy, a resident of Nodtway County, Missouri, and owning-a farm there, voluntarily entered the service of the Confederate States under General Sterling Price,
and followed the fortunes of that officer and his army when
they left Missouri. At this time there were two mortgages
ou different parts of his farm, or instruments of writing
which the holders of them asserted to be mortgages. These
were due, and the holders in May, 1862, and November, 1863,
procured a decree of foreclosure of them. This proceeding
