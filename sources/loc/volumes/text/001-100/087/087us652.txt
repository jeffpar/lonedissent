TREAT V. JEMISON.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.-Judgment of the court.

TREAT V. JEmISo.
A judgment affirmed for want of such an assignment of errors as is required
by the twenty-first rule; there being in the record no plain error not
assigned and such as the court thought fit to be noticed by it without a
proper assignment.

ERROR to the Circuit Court for the District of California.
Rule twenty-one of this court provides that the brief of
the counsel for the plaintiff iii error shall contain, "in the
order here galed,"1. A statement of the case, &c.
2. An assignment of the errors relied upon, which, in
cases brought up by writ of error, shall set" out separately
and specifically each error asserted and intended to be
urged."
And the rule further declares that "without such an assignment of errors counsel will not be heard, except at the
request of the court, and errors not assigned according to
this rule will be disregarded, though the cdurt at its option
may notice a plain error not assigned."
With these rules, officially published in form* when first
made, and long in force and generally acted on at the bar,
the present case was brought up here and submitted. The
briefs were elaborate, but contained no such assignment of
errors as by the rule is prescribed.
Mr. N. Bennett, for the plaintiff in error; Messrs. Foote,
Roughton, and Reynolds, contra.
The CHIEF JUSTICE:
The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed. There is
no such. assignment of errors in this case as is.required by
the rule, and we do iot see in the record any error that
ought to be noticed without an, assignment.
