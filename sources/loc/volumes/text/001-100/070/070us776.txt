tervene to protect any interest he may have, we are of
opinion that, on the hearing, he must show some title, legal
or equitable, to the land in dispute, before the court is .justifled in disturbing the survey in his interest. In the present
case, the court did modify the survey, so as to exclude all
the land to which the appellant showed such title.
2. The survey conforms as nearly to the decree confirming
the grant as it can well be made to do. It is true that the
location as made by the surveyor places the northern boundary of the lot some distance south of the arroyo; but, as
all the prescribed elements of location cannot be complied
with, we do not see how it can be located more in conformity with the decree than it is.
And as the appellant has not. shown that he is prejudiced
by the survey as it is confirmed by the District Court, its
decree is
.AFIRMED WITH COSTS.
