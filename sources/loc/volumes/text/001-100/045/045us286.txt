SUPREME COURT.
The United States v. McLemore.

down by Lord Ellenborough, in Pritt v. Fairclough, 3 Camp. R.
305, as to the rules of evidence, was adopted, namely, "1That they
must expand according to the exigencies of society." And in the
Bank of Columbia v. Lawrence, 1 Peters, 583, speaking of a rule
as to diligence, Tl~ompson, J., says, -" 1 For the sake of general
convenience it has been found necessary to 'enlarge this rule." ,
But all I ask here is to go as far as the existing rules of evidence
seem to justify, and let reasonable inferences and presumptions be
made by the jury from all that is stated in the protest, and thus
decide whether the note was not probably present when the demand was made.

THE UNITED STATES, APPELLANT, V. JOHN Q. McLEornE.
Although a Circuit Court, sitting as a court of law, may direct credits to be given
on a judgment in favor of the United States, and consequently examine the
grounds on which such an entry is claimed, and may direct the execution to be
stayed until such an investigation shall be made, yet it cannot e.tertain a bill
on the equity side, praying that the United States may be perpetually enjoined
from proceeding upon such judgment.
Nor can a decree or judgment be entered against the government for costs.

THIs was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States
for the District of Middle Tennessee,.sitting as a court of equity.
It is unnecessary to recite all the circumstances which led to the
filing of the bill in equiity, as it was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction in the Circuik Court. The facts in the case are sumnlarily stated in the opinion of the court. It is proper, however, to
exhibit the account to which the opinion of Mr. Justice Wayne
refers :Tnn UITED STATES OF AMERICA V. SERCY'S ExEcUrrOs AND SECURITIES.

The case was argued by Jfr. Mason (Attorney-General), foi the
appellant, and by Mr. Brinley and JXr. Eaton, for the defenu nt.
Mr. Justice McLEAN delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal fiom the dec;ee of the Circuit Court of the
United States, for the District of Middle Tennessee.

SUPREME COURT.
The Upnited States v. McLemore.

The bill was filed by McLemore and Cantwell.surviving executor of Robert Searcy, deceased, and surviving executor of George
M. Deoderick, deceased, representing that a judgment was obtained by the United States against the executors of Searcy, for
the sum of seventeen thousand and twenty-eight dollars and fortyone cents. That various payments had bben made on the judgment until the whole or nearly the whole had been paid. That the
last execution on the judgment was issued the l0th of January,
1842, for a balance claimed on the judgment of two thousand eight
hundred thirty-two dollars and thirty-seven cents. And they state
that their payments were made to different persons named, who succeeded each other in the office of District Attorney of the United
States for Middle Tennessee ; and that by the absence and death
of a partrof 'them it is difficult to show the sums paid. That the
money was principally collected by the district attorneys on notes
handed them for collection, the proceeds of which, when received,
were to be applied to the discharge of the judgment. That this
arrangement was sanctioned by the treasury department. And the
prayer of the bill is, that the judgment may be enjoined, &c.
The District Attorney of the United States answered the bill,
and the matter of payme.its was referred to a master, who rep ted a balance against the United States,'after paying the judgn . nt.
On this report; the district judge holding the Circuit Court decreed
a perpetual injunction, and that the United States should pay the
costs.
There was no jurisdiction of this case in the Circuit Court, as
the government is not liable to be sued, except with its own consent, given by law. Nor can a decree or judgment be entered
against the government for costs.
The Circuit Court, as a court of law, may direct credits to be
given on the judgment, and having a right to order satisfaction to
be entered on the judgment, consequently may examine the grounds
on which such an entry is claimed, and may direct the execution
to be stayed until such an investigation shall be made.
This bill is dismissed.
Mr. Justice WAYNE. concurred in the decisidn of the case,
but said it appeared in the record that a different mode of computing interest had been pursued from that whici had been settled
by this court. In Livingston v. Story, 13 Peters, 371, the court
said : -" The correct rule, in general, is, that the creditor shall
calculate interest whenever a payment is made. To this interest
the payment is first to be applied; and if it exceed the interest due,
the balance is to be applied to diminish the principal. If the payment fall short of the interest, the balance of interest is not to be
added to the principal so as to produce interest. This rule is
equally applicable, whether the debt be one which expressly draws

interest, or on which interest is given in the name of damages."
Nor is it to be considered, by any thing which the court has done
upon the motion, that any sanction is given to any other mode of
computing interest.

ZELLER'S LESSEE V. JAcoB K. ECKERT'<AND OTHERS.
Under a will which devised laud to the son of the testator, and provided that the
widow should continue in possession and occupation of the premises until the
son arrived at the age of fteen years, she was entitled to their possession and
enjoyment until the time when tie child would have reached the age of fifteen
if he had lived, although he died before that time.
Her possession, therefore, was not adverse to the heirs of the child, during that
penod.
Where the original possession by the holder of land is in privity with the titje of
the rightful owner, in order to enable such holder to avail himself of the statute
of limitations, nothing short of an open and explicit disavowal and (disclaimer of
holding under that title, and assertion of title in himself brought home to the
other party, will satisfy the law.
The burden of proof is on the holder to establish such a change in the character of
the possession.
The statute does not begin to run until the possession becomes tortious ana wrongful by the disloyal acts of the tenant, which must be open, continued, and notorious, so as to preclude all doubt as to the character of the holding, or the want of
knowledge on.he part of the owners.
In this case there was evidence enough given upon this'point to authorize the court
below to submit the question of adverse possession to the jury, and advise them
that a foundation was laid upon which they might presume a grant for the purpose of quieting the tide.
The whole charge of the judge to the jury is incorporated into this record. This
mode of making up the error books is exceedingly inconvenient
and embarrassing
to the court, and is a departure from familiar and established practice.
So far as error is founded upon the bill of eiceptions incorporated into the record,
it lies only to exceptions taken at tfie trial, and to the ruling of the law by the
judge, and to the admission or rejection of evidence. And only so much of the
evidence as may be necessary to present the legal questions thus raised and noted
should be carried into the bill of exceptions. All beyond serves to encumber
and confuse the record, and to perplex and embarrass both court and counsel.
The earlier forms under the statute giving the bill of exceptions are models which
it would be wise to consult and adhere to.

THis was a writ of error to the Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to bring up for
review certain instructions to the jury in an action of ejectment
brought by the plaintiff in error against the defendants in error, and
in which the latter obtained the verdict.
Frederick White was the owner of the premises in question,
being part of a small tract of"land situate in the county of Lncaster, Pennsylvania, of which he died seized in March, 1798, leaving
a last will and testament by which he devised the said land in fee to
Frederick White, Jr., his only'child, who ivas then about four years
of age. He also provided in the will that his widow should conVOL. IV.
