A person cannot legally purchase on his own account that which his duty or trust
requires him to sell on account of another, nor purchase on account of another
that which he sells on his own account. He is not allowed to unite the two
opposite characters of buyer and seller.
A purchase, per interpositam personan,by a trustee or agent, of the particular
property of which he has the sale, or in which he represents another, whether:
he has an interest in it or not, carries fraud on the face of it.
This rule applies t, a purchase by executors, at open sale, although they were empowered by the '-ill to sell the estate of their testator for the benefit of heirs and
legatees, a part of which heirs and legatees they themselves were.
A purchase so made by executors will be set aside.
The decisions of the courts of several States, upon this subject, examined and rea
marked upon.
Relaxations of this rule of the civil law, which were made in some countries of
Europe, were not adopted by the Spanish law, and of course never reached Louisiana. Nor were those' relaxations carried so far as to allow a testamentary or
dative executor to buy the property which he was appointed to administer.
The maxims and qualifications of the civil law, upon this point, examined.
Although courts of equity generally adopt.the statutes of limitation, yet, in a case
of actual fraud, they will grant relief within the lifetime of either of the parties upon whom the fraud is proved, or within thirty years after it has been discovered or become known to the party whose rights are affected by it.
Within what time a constructive trust will be barred must depend upon the circumstances of the case, and these are always examinable.
Acquittances given to an executor, without a full knowledge of au the circumstances, where such information had been withheld by the executor, and menaces
and promises thrown out to prevent inquiry, are not binding.

WSUPREME

COURT.
Michoud et al. v. Girod et aL

THis case was brought up by appeal from the Circuit Court of
the United States, for the Eastern District of Louisiana, sitting as
a court of equity.
The widow Pargod and others, defendants in this court, were
complainants in the court below, and obtained a. decree in their
favor, from which the other parties appealed. They alleged, that
a series of fraudulent transactions occurred; commencing in 1813,,
by which they had been deprived of their fair share of the estate of
Claude Francois Girod, whose heirs they were, and that the chief
agent in this fraud was Nicholas Girod, a brother of the deceased
Claude Franois Girod, and also a brother of some of the complainants, and relative of the rest.
Claude Frangois Girod was a resident of the parish of Assumptjon, in the State of Louisiana, and died in the mopth.of November,
1813, leaving a last will and testament, dated op the 30th of November, 1812, and a codicil, dated on the 4th of November, 1813,
which will was admitted to probate, with the codicil, on the 8th of
November, 1813. He never was married, and left eight brothers
and sisters, and the children of a predeceased sister. These surviving brothers and sisters, with the exception of Jacques, otherwise called Jacques Antoine Girod (who was excluded by the
terms of the will), were the legal heirs of the deceased Claude
Frangois Girod, each for the one eighth part of his estat6 and the
succession ; and the heirs and legal representatives of the said predeceased sister, the legal heirs by representation of their deceased
mother, for the remaining eighth part of the estatq.
The proceedings in the case were exceedingly complicated.
There was a bill, and an amended bill, and a supplemental bill, and
another amended bill, and then another amended bill. Instead of
pursuing the case through all these details, the simplest course will
be to state-the charges in the bill, and the documents brought forward to sustain them.
The will of Claude Francois Girod was as follows " I, Claude Francois Girod, the legitimate son of Frangois
Silvestre Girod, deceased, and of the late Frangois, born Dubois,
native of Th~ne, in Savoy, diocese of Geneva, province of France,
and now a resident of the parish of Assumption, on Bayou
Lafourche, in the State of Louisiana, being about sixty years of age,
and desirous to die in the Roman Catholic and Apostolic religion,
under which I have ever lived, with a-firm belief in the mysteries
'of our holy religion, do ordain this my last will or testament, in
case .I should be overtaken by death, the hour of which I am uncertain of; and as it behooves all living beings to settle their temporal affairs, when they are in the full enjoyment of their health and
reason, in order to avoid terebythe difficulties which arise when
we are laboring under a dangerous disease, which takes from us the
use of our reasonable faculties, and consequently deprives us of the

The bill of the complainants in the court below also charged,
that the executors, in order to appropriate, wickedly and fraudulently, to their own use and benefit, the funds of the succession,
did, in their account of the 23d of May, 1817, place themselves
as creditors of said succession for a sum of nearly forty-nine thousand dollars, to wit, said Nicholas Girod for forty thousand four
hundred and eighteen dollars and nine cents, and said Jean FranSois Girod for eight thousand two hundred and fifty-three dollars
and twenty cents, although no sum was due to them.

Claude Franois Girod, being in town, came to deponent's house,
and requested him to call uiion him in his room, saying that he had
something to confide to him ; and that having repaired thither,
said Claude Francois Girod communicated his intentions of preventing all difficulties after his death, saying that he was desirous
to settle with his brother Nicolas, that he had been to church,
where he had knelt before the Holy Virgin, beseeching her to assist him in terminating his affairs with his said brother Nicolas ;
deponent, knowing nearly all their affairs, asked him in what manner he intended to settle them ; then the said Claude *Fran~ois
Girod toldihim, - Here are my propositions ; I will sell my house
in St. Louis Street for cash to my said brother Nicolas, with a
view to settle with him, reserving, for the term of my natural life,
the use of one of the back rooms of said house ; and if there be
any balance remaining due to him, he will grant me a delay to pay
the same ; - and he requested deponent to submit those propositions
to Nicolas Girod's consideration, which deponent did ; but the
said Nicolas Girod. answered him surely, No ; and added, that he
requested deponent not to interfere in that affair, saying that he
himself had made proposalÂ§ to Claude Francois Girod, his

an account against the succession, and passed it through a similar

nearly all the coheirs, having full faith and confidence in the honesty and integrity of Nicholas and Jean Franois Girod, did intrust
them with their powers of attorney, authorizing them to represent
_tae interests of such coheirs in the settlement of the succession ;

said executors obtained from some of them an acquittance or
transfer of all claims against the succession.
The bill then recited that Nicholas Girod Had died,in possession
of all the real estate of Claude Francois Gikod except some parts
which were mentioned as having been sold, all of which property
thus remaining with Nicholas Girod the complainants claimed as
the original coheirs of Claude Frangois Girod, and also an account
of the rents and profits. All claim against the other executor,
Jean Franois Girod, was released.
Amongst the matters introduced in evidence was the following
letter, which is inserted because it is referred to in the opinion of
the court; and was sent by Girod at the same time that he obtained from his two sisters the receipts which are mentioned in another part of this statement.
" ew Orleans, 27th May,.-1847.
"My sister Quetend - To-morrow, our brother Jean Francois
embarks for Havre ; from thence he will proceed home, for the
purpose of delivering to each one of you what is coming to him
from the succession of our late brother, Claude Francois. I assure
ybu, that if I had not been anxious to protect the honor of this brother, every thing would have been absorbed in settlement of accounts with me, and by other debts ; besides, whether you have it
now or later, the greater part cannot escape you ; - this is to be
understood of those who shall not cease to merit our friendship and
esteem. Beware not to imitate the example of Jacques, who has
for ever lost our regard by his iniquities toward our whole family.
Hereafter, when I shall have, in some measure, recovered from my
losses by different bankrupts, I will send you some assistance from
time to time. At present J. F. has orders to regulate his conduct
towards you all by your conduct towards him. Farewell.

All these legatees were made defendants to the bill.
In the course of the suit an injunction was issued against Antoine
Michoud, the executor of Nicholas Girod, to prevent him from
making any payment or distribution of tbhfunds received or to be
received.
The defendants all answered; the principal answer being that of
the legatees. They denied that Claude Francois Girod enumerated in his will and codicil all the debts due by him, but averted
that he owed other and much larger debts ; insited that the authorization granted to the executors by the will, for the sale of the
property, was legal ; that no law of Louisiana, then existing, contained a provision by which a judge ex officio auctioneer was
rendered inmcmpetent, any more than any other auctioneer in the
State, to sell any property whatsoever, situated within or without.

made of the price of the property so sold by the.judge; the circumstance that a portion of the property was beyond his jurisdicion was of no consequence, and the price thereof must be regarded
as fair, and the sale as having been duly made ; admitted the sales
of property to St. Felix and Laignel, but denied that any retrocession of the property to the executors ever took place, inasmuch
as no retrocession could take place between the parties, unless the
executors had been previously the sole and exclusive owners of the
property ; denied that any fraud or breach of trust was committed
by the executors.
The respondents, in their answer, also admitted that the executors bad placed themselves as creditors, in their account of the
succession, but averred that they had a right lawfully and justly to
do so ; that Nicholas Girod'was creditor by virtue of a final judgment of a competent tribunal, namely, the Parish Court of the Parish
and City of New Orleans, rendered on the 6th of May, 1816 ; they
further aver, that. this judgment has, for upwards of twenty-six
years past, acquired the force of res adjudicata, and cannot be
disturbed; -that the account presented by the executors was duly
homologated by the Court of Probates,'and that judgment of homologation has- also acquired the force of res adjudicata. The
respondents also deny that the executors, in placing themselves as
creditors of the succession in their account, and in ratifying that
account under the power of attorney intrusted to them by their
coheirs, abused the trust and betrayed .the interest confided to
them for their own advantage, and to the wrong and injury of their
constituents.
The respondents further denied, that Nicholas Girod, by means
of false and fraudulent representations, or concealment, had induced
the complainants to sign acquittances; averred that they were signed
freely, after being well informed of all the circumstances; that
Hyppolite Pargoud, the son of Madame Pargoud, had been in New
Orleans, &c., &c.

The respondents inserted in- their answer a number of family
letters, from which they inferred that Nicholas Girod was a charitable man, and had -constantly been the supporter of his distant
relations, and concluded by pleading prescription.
To these answers there was a general replication.
In the progress of the suit the following admissions -were filed by
the respective parties :-

THEO. H. McCALEB,

[SEAL.]

United States Judge."
From this decree, the defendants appealed to this court.
The cause was argued by Mr. Eutis, for the appellants, and
JMr. Janin, for the appellees.
The following is a synopsis of the argument of Mr.
Eustis for
1
the appellants.
The facts necessary to an understanding of this case are few and
not complicated ; most of them are admitted in the answer, and
others are established by documentary evidence.
The action is founded on an alleg I purchase of the effects of
the s'uecession of Claude Girod by his'executors.
Claude Girod died in 1813, leaving a will made in 1812.
The sales ;omplained of took place in 1814.
The commencement of the adverse possession, .and the 'uninterrupted, exclusive, and notorious enjoyment of the revenues of the
,estates being fixed by the complainants' own bill, we proceed at
once to the matters of defence which those facts present, and
which are set forth formally in the answer.
1. The first grouhd of defence is the entire want of equity in
the complainants' case, arising from the silence, acquiescence, and
laches of the complainants since 1814.
The principles on which courts of equity refuse their assistance
to parties under circumstances like the present are familiar to the
court. The most recent cases are the following: - McKnight v.
Taylor, 1. Howard, 168-; Bowman v. Walthen, I Howard, 193;
Smith v. Clay, 3 Brown's Ch. R. 640, n. ; Stearns v. Page, 1 Story, 215 ; Giles v. Baremore, 5 Johns. Ch. R. 550 ; Piatt r. VatVOL. IV

Fonblanque's Equity (last edition), notes to, Book 1, c. 4, Â§ 27.
2. The, allegations and evidence adduced by the complainants
are no. reasonably definite as to the time, occasion, and circumstances of the alleged concealment, misrepresentation, and frauds;
nor is any account given of the time of the discovery. Of the fact
of the adverse possession, it is not even alleged in terms that the
plaintiffs were ignorant ; the allegation of ignorance of the real situation, &c., is not sufficient for a court of equity to base its action
upon. Stearns v. Page, 1 Story's R. 215.
The -allegations of ignorance, concealment, &c., are expressly
denied and put at issue by defendants.
By the testimony of J. F. Girod, J. M. Girod, Michoud, and
Rivolet, receipts2 &c., the fact of knowledge is put beyond a reasonable doubt.
3. The allegations of the complainants in their amended bill
afford strong evidence -that the relief sought by them will not be a
matter of equity, but a speculation upon events.
The will of the testator, Nicholas Girod, and the large amount
of legacies, was the cause of the suit, not the injustice and wrongs
of 1814.
The release of the co-executor, J. F. Girod, and their conduct
towards him, point to the same conclusion. He is rich and alive.
The chances of inheritance offer a greater benefit than the result
of litigation. They acquiesce, discharge him, and await his bounty N. Girod is dead, and all their vials of wrath are opened
upon .his grave.
4. The defendants rely upon prescription as a defence.
There is a marked difference between piescriptions and statutes
of limitation. The former. create rights ; the latter merely reach
remedies,,and in a very qualified and artificial manner.
Prescription is a manner of acquiring property and of discharging debts by the effect of time. It is a title as much so as that of
inheritance or sale is. All are on the same footing, and a court
can no more interfere with rights under the one than under the
others. Louisiana Code, 3421 ; Code of 1809, p. 482, art. 32.
By the civil law, prescription is a mode of extinguishing obligations, and is classed withpayment, novation, 4c. The obligation
itself is extinguished in foro conscientim, as well as in foro legis.

2219 ; Institutes of the C-vil Law of Spain, p. 103, lib. 29,tit. 2,
p. 108.
Under the civil law, from motives of public policy, great weight
in matters of property is given to possession. The oldest legal
maxims of which we have record establish the, principles, which
modern nations, so far from deviating from, have rather restricted.

JANUARY

TERM, 1846.

Michoud et al. v. Girod et al.

The policy has stood the test of experience and of time. Possession is at once the object, the attribute, and the proof of property ; henceit forms the basis of a title, that of prescription.
Nicholas Girod purchased and possessed the estates mentioned
in the bill since 1814.
He acquired to their a complete title, by prescription, under the
laws of Louisiana. His acts of conveyance were public -and authentic, and duly recorded in the proper offices. There are several articles of the Code providing prescriptions; which cover this
case. Article 2218, and 204, p. 302, of the Code of 1809,
provide, that in all cases in which the action of nullity or of rescission of an agreement is not limited to a shorter period by a
particular law, that action may be brought within ten years. In
cases of error or deception,'the time of the prescription dates from
the day on which either was discovered. In this case, there was
no secrecy or concealment, and there could be no discovery, in relation to the fact of the sales to N. Girod. The property. was not
kept concealed under the name of a third person, but in his own,
and placed on the public records as belonging to him. The adverse possession alone was full notice to the complainants. It was
sufficient to put them on the inquiry, and they had all the means of
information to lead them to a knowledge of the facts, and in law
are deemed consonant of them. Sugden on Vendors, 542 ; 1
Atkyns, 489 ; 1 Johns. Ch. R. 267; 2 Binney, 466 ; 1"5 Johns.
R. 555; Wilhison v. Watkins, 3kPeters, 52; 10 Peters, 222, 223;
1 Howard, 196 ; see also the opinion of Pothier on prescription,
as affecting absentees, Treatise on Obligations, No. .649 ; Institutes of the Civil Law of Spain, lib. 2, tit. 2, p. 108.
The only fraud in relation to the sales which can be pretended
is, that the executors purchased at.the public sales. This fact, if
it was so, is as apparent when the titles were put in their names as
it is now.
But, if the only fraud in the sales arises from the incapacity of
the partyto purchase, the prescription of he article 3507 applies
with great force. That provides that the action of nullity or rescission of contracts, testaments, or other acts for -the rescissions
of partitions, &c., is prescribed by five years against persons living
in the State, and ten years against absentees.
Is not the agreement between J.F. Girod and.Me. Pargoud, of
November 10, 1817, a contract, - an act ? Is it not, under,the
decisions of our courts, a partition ? It is stated in the instrument,
that it is for her share'in the succession reduced into movable effects, mobilise, turned into money. "Whatever may be the form
of the act, it is well settled that every first settlement between heirs
or partners, by which a state of indivision is terminated, is in substance a partition," say the Supreme Court. And an hetion to set
aside, on the ground of lesion and fraudi an agreement by which

SUPREME COURT.

six slaves were given in consideration of a relinquishment on the
part of an heir of all her right and interest in the succession of her
mother, in favor of her father-in-law, was held to be barred by the
prescription of five years under this article 3507. See 3 Robinson's A. 317 ; 14 Louisiana R. 22; 15 ibid. 517; 16 ibid. 252;
Tippet and husband v. Jett. Here the court hold that even fraud
is prescribed against under this article, without any reference as
to the time of the discovery of it.
The prescription of actions for lesion, in contracts generally, is
only four years. Code, 1870. . There is. another prescription
which protects the defendants, - that of twenty years under a just
title ;, that is, a title by which property can be transferred. Louisiana Code, 3442 ; Code of 1809, p. 488, arts. 60-72.
After the 10th of November, 1817, the date of the receipt of the
funds of the succession, in which it is stated that the property is
mobiliee, - converted into money, - there was nothing to impugn
the justice of the title to the property sold, which could not be affected by any misappropriation of the purchase money. This
would constitute a claim, and give rise to a personal action, which
would not affect the title to the property, which must rest on tbe
state of things in 1814. The heirs in Europe must be considered
as being satisfied with the price the property sold for, and constituted themselves creditors for their respective shares. The complaint that they have been wronged out of the proceeds presupposes that the sales were made ; and though it may or not be
true that they have been hardly dealt with, as the complainants allege, it by no means follows that the property was, in 1814, sold
or purchased in bad faith. In matters of prescription by possession, good faith is presumed ; bad faith, in a possession, must be
proved. Art. 3447. On the form of the title, see Toullier, 8
vol., No. 508, 509, art. 3,453, et seq. ; Merlin, Questions de
Droit, verbo .ineur.
There is a statute on this subject which clearly points out the
policy of the law, which is decidedly against stale claims, and reduces the prescription in previous sales to administrators, executors, &c. to two years from its passage, and recognizes their right
to purchase in all cases in which they have an interest in the property sold, as heirs, legatees, or partners. This law is very important in the consideration of this case. Laws of Louisiana of
1840, p. 123, No. 112, .passed on the 28th of March, 1840.
5. The angwer contains an argument on the facts. The letters
offered by defendants are found at pp. 200-215; the answers under oath from pp. 91 - 101. The most important deposition, that
of the co-executor, J. F. Girod, taken in Paris, at p. 139. It

fendants are all strangers to them. They are the dative executors,
appointed by the Court of Probates, and not by the will of the testator and legatees. Vide the will.
Why did they not call upon him who alone could give them information,- upon N. Girod, in his lifetime ?
But they called upon J. F. Girod, the co-executor of Claude
Girod, and the alleged confederate in these marvellous frauds.
Let his deposition speak. Doeg he say the sales" were fraudulent,
or that his coheirs were wronged ? It is decisive of the case.
One sentence alone closes it :"Then (1817) it was that N. Girod, who had settled the estate, handed mea copy of the account rendered to the Court of
Probates, and a copy of C. F. Girod's testament, and it was on
the faith of these documents) presented to the heirs in Europe,
that I paid to each of them and to the legatees what accrued to
them."
J. F. Girod was sent to Europe by his brother to pay the heirs
who resided in Savoy. The act in the bill of complaint, signed
by Me. Pargoud, was- made at Annecy, in -Savoy. He met his
brother, the priest, in Paris. He refused to examine the accounts
in Paris. Vide his letter. The account on which the heirs were
paid by''J. F. Girod is found at length at pp. 125 - 128 ; the will
of Claude Girod, pp. 163, 164. In the account are stated the
amounts due 1N. Girod and J. F. Girod, namely, of $ 40,413-09,
and of $ 8,253"20. These items are charged as paid, and the
succession is credited with the proceeds of the property sold.
The account is a settlement of the. affairs of the succession, on
which the payment was made in Savoy, in 1817.
A strict examination of the evidence must result in the conviction of an entire want of evidence io establish any thing like fraud
on the part of N. Girod.
There are some matters of law which it may be well to consider
under this head.
a. By the will the executors were empowered to sell, without
the intervention of justice, as to them should seem best for the interest of the absent.
b. The executors were bodnd to cause the property to be sold.
Code of 1809, p. 246, arts. 173, 174 ; p. 174, art. 128.
c. The heirs present had a right to insist on a sale for cash.
ibid., p. 174, art. 129.
d. The law requires the estate to be settled within the year,
where it can be done. The possession of the executor does not
continue after a year and a day. Ibid., p. 244, arts. 166, 169, 173,
et al. ; 4 Martin's R. 340, 609 ; Norwood's case, 10 ibid. 723.
e. After a considerable lapse of time, the presumption omnia.
rite acta esse applies ; besides, by the law of 1834, (p. 123 of
pamphlet acts), all informalities growin& out of a public sale by a

parish judge, or other public officer, are prescribed by the lapse
of five years. 2 Robinson, 377 ; 16 Louisiana Rep. 554.
f. But the executors did not sell ; the- judge sold at public auction, and in the most public, fair, and formal manner.
Code of 1809, pp. 174, 127- 129. The judge sells, not the
executor or curator. "The sale was complete without any act of
the executors. 3 Martin, 592.
g. No decree of the court was necessary to authorize the sale.
If there was, one must be presumed after this lapse of time ; for
the judge himself sold. But none was necessary. Commentary
of Gregolio Lopez on Law, 62, tit. 18, part. 3, which treats of
sales made by executors, and only requires them to be made at
auction.
6. The decisions of the Supreme Court went.far beyond the
law in establishing incapacities to purchase at judicial sales under
the old laws ; the legislative interpretatioki of 1840, before cited,
puts this fact beyond question. In interpreting the Spanish laws,
the decisions of the Supreme Court of Louisiana are very unsafe
guides, as. every one knows who has scrutinized them.
It is a great mistake to suppose that purchases made by an executor, at a public sale made by a judge of the property of a succession, are absolutely nill and void. The inhibition is, at best, a
matter of precaution, to prevent abuse, and is established in the
interest of the heirs, and for their benefit exclusively. The authorities cited by the complainants pfove this beyond question. .13
Louisiana R. 396. This they may renounce or enforce, after a
reasonable tune, according to their own peculiar views. Louisiana
Code, art. 11 ; 7 Toullier, 562, et seq., 665, c! seq. ; Sugden on
Vendors (ed. of 1834), 436. In all cases where a purchase is
made by a trustee, it is optional with the cestui que trust to set it
aside. Story's Equity, Â§Â§ 322, 308. The cestui que trust has
a right to set aside the prchase, and have the estatb resold, if he
choose, within any reasonable time, to dissent from the purchase.
5 Vesey, 678 ; 13 Vesey, 600.
The purchase by a curator or trustee is nalum prohibitum, and
not malum in. se.. 8 Toullier, Â§ 517, p. 713 ; 2 Sugden on Vendors (edition of 1836),. 143 ; notes to page 125, No. 329.
In Randall v. Ermington (1-0 Vesey, 428), the fact of the purchase
was not clear, the possession of Ermihgton was equivocal ; but, in
all cases where there is a continued public adverse possession, the
party dissenting must apply within a reasonable time for relief; he
must not lie by and speculate on events. 5 Vesey, 678 and 680;
Newland on Contracts.
The court cannot permit the parties in this case to speculate on
the chances of war. The appraisement, the basis of the mortuary
oceedings, is not impugned, nor is the adequacy of the price.
he complainants were satisfied with it, even in 1817. They have

waited until the growth of the country has given an increased value
-to real property, and now ask the court, not to do justice,, but to
accomplish for them a speculation. Had Louisiana been reduced
to colonial vassalage, and enjoyed the advantages of negrophilism,
or had the father of the floods, instead of adding to 'the extent of
the suburban estates, reduced, by its frequent abrasions, their extent and value, and burdened it with riparian works and charges,
we should have been held accountable for the price, -- at their option
the thing or the price, as it is most advantageous to the claimants.
What is this but a speculation on events, which law and good faith
repudiate ?
7. There has been a ratification of the sales by receiving the
price, or part of it. This is what is called the voluntary execution
of the contract of sales. -The article 2252 of our Code, and 238
of the Code of 1809, p. 310, say it is sufficient that the obligation
be voluntarily executed, to throw the- proof. of ignorance 'of the.
party ratifying on him who alleged it. Where there is an execution of the contract by receiving the price, the party executing it
is presumed to know any defects-or grounds on which it could be
annulled, and ignorance of them must be proved, which Tcan 'be
very easily done where there has been any misrepresentation, or
deceit. And if part of the price be received, the remedy of the
party is by a personal action against the executor or trustee for any
abuse of his functions.
8 Toullier, 508 - 510, 513, cit. Merlin, Questions de Droit,
verbo Alineur.
The case of Rivas, relied on by complainants, contains no new
doctrine. The question there was, whether the party had received
part of the price of the plantation in dispute knowingly, that is,
knowing that the money he received came from "the sale. The
court, not being satisfied of the fact,'bf course held that there was
no ratification, but asserted the principle maintained in 8 Toullier,
519, art. 2252 of the Louisiana Code.
The law never permits a person to mislead another by his silence,
where, by the relations between: them, he is bound to speak. This
property had been sold, the executors were the agents of complainants, the accounti were before them, the price which the property
brought was laid before them, and if they thought proper to receive
their portions, they certainly ratified the sales. Their claim for a
further portion of the price remains to be considered. Story on
Agency, Â§ 255, and cases cited.,
The application of these principles to the payment and discharge
in Europe, as explained in the testimony of J. F. Girod, requires
no observation.
8. An examination of the articles of the Code of 1809 cited by
complainants will satisfy the court that the parish judges of the
place wherie the property was situated were competent to make the

inventories, appraisements, and sales. Page 246, art. 174 ; page
174, art. 127 - 129.
The French text of art. 127, cited, puts the matter beyond controversy, - le juge de 'la paroisse ou des paroisses, in which the
deceased had property, hall make the inventory ; and art. 128
provides, that the judge making the inventory shall make the sales.
The- art 137, P. 178, refers to curators appointed by a judge.
The executor is appointed by the will, and not by the judge.
It is not alleged in the bill or suppleniLntary bills,"Mat the parish
-judges who made the inventories and sales acted without authority,
except as to the sale of the land in the parish of Lafourche Interior b5y the judge of Assumption. Nor is it alleged that the Court
of Probates of New Orleans was without jurisdiction as to the settlement of the executor's accounts and liquidation of the succession.
The only allegation as to the defect of jurisdiction of any of the
courts is found in the amended bill, p. 102, in which it is charged
that the Parish Court of New Orleans, which rendered the two
judgments alleged to be fraudulent, is incompetent. How incompetent ? By reason of what ? Query) for want of jurisdiction,
or for want of 'proper parties ?
Questions of jurisdiction, under the old judicial system of Louisiana, particularly of the courts of probates, have been difficult;
and, after this lapse of time, eveiy presumption must be in favor
of what has been done in courts of justice. 2 Robinson's R. 377;
Drenet's case, 8 N. S. 705.
As to the undoubted jurisdiction of the court of the parish and
city of New Orleans, which rendered the judgments attacked as
fraudulent, vide Tabor's case, 3 Martin, N. S., 676 ; 6 Martin,
N. S., 676; 8 ibid. 241 and 705;-7 ibid. 378. The Code of Practice, enacted in 1825, vested the jurisdiction in the courts of probate exclusively of all claims for money against successions.
The jurisdiction of the Court of Probates of New Orleans,
which homologated the executor's account, not having been questioned in the bill this court will not disturb its decrees. The
jurisdiction existed ratione materice, the creditors assented thereto ;
the succession was solvent, and the vesting of the jurisdiction in
any other court by the articles quoted is merely a matter of implication, and by no means exclusive. Vide Tabor's case, cit. 3

rendered. 1 Louisiana R. 21. Code of Practice, article 608, and
notes.
It the cqurt would not give the party relief, then, and only then,
can relief be sought before the courts of the United States. The
doctrine established by this court in the Gaines case, concerning
relief against the effect of a will, is similar in all respects to that
which is here invoked.
11. It appears that in the account filed by the executors in the
Court of Probates of New Orleans, and exhibited, with the will, to
the heirs in Europe by J. F. Girod, on which he made the payrients to the heirs, were two sums with which the executors charged
the succession of Claude Girod ; one was for $ 40,413-09, as paid
to Nicolas Girod ; and the other was for $ 8,25820, paid to J.
F. Gired The sums are stated to be by account annexed, approved by the judge. Vide Code of 1809, p. 180, article 145.
The complainants, acting uniformly on the principle of -orie
course of conduct for the living and another for the dead, have
discharged J. F. Girod, and seek to make N. Girod's succession
responsible for both debts.
it appears that the judge of the Court of Probates did not approve
these accounts against the succession of. Claude Girod until thej
had been litigated on, and settled judicially, in a court of la*.
Judgments were rendered on each claim in the coart of the parish
and city of New Orleans ; on that of N. Girod on the 5th Decemn-"
ber, 1814, and on that of J. F. Girod on the 6th May, 1815. On
these judgments the vials of wrath are poured forth by the complainants. Rec. 163-182.
Recourse is had to conjecture, when nothing would have been
easier than to prove any fact in relation to these judgments by J. F.
Girod himself, who, so far from being interrogated concerning these
debts, is provided with a complete and full discharge.
The consequences and effect of this discharge of the plaintiff.in
one of the suits, and the recipient of the money and the defendant
in the Qth6r, will certainly have an important bearing on the equity
of the complainants' case ; and the absence of this proof, which is
at hand, will show that they rely more on confmion and conjecture
for success than on evidence.
The court of the parish and city of New Orleans had jurisdiction
of the cases, as has been shown.
An objection has been made, that there were not proper parties.

cession, establishing in an ordinary tribunal, as the laws stood before the Code of Practice ? The art. 137 (p. 248, Code of
1809) gives the power of one executor to represent the succession,
where there are mor- than o e executor who has accepted. Code,
1674 ; vide 3 Martin's R. 247. The appearance and answer of
the defensor of absent heirs strengthens.the validity and fairness of
ihe proceedings.
The judgments, being valil in point of form, maststand until the
are annulled and declared void by a proper tribunal. 7 Martin, 1.
S., 257 ; 11 Martin's R. 607 ; 5 Martin, N. S., 664.
These judgments are attacked as fraudulent. Unfortunately for
the complainants, there is no circumstance by them even conjectured which may not have been removed by evidence.
The testimony and evidence on which thes6 judgments were
rendered is not before us ;. but let us take up that in favor of N.
Girod, which is the only one we have any interest in - maintaining,
since the release of J. F. Girod.
Claude Girod was a trader, and left' at his death various accounts, books, papers, &c., which were inventoried at his death.
He had transactions with his elder brother Nicholas, who was a
merchant in New Orleans. The witnesses examined by the arbitrators were Boussignes, Pacaud, Guillot, and J. F. Girod.
The grbitrators, as will be seen by the reasons appended to each
'item, founded their opinion on the testimony of witnesses, and the
examination of books, documents, and vouchers.
It is complained that the case was referred to arbitrators ; - was
it not a case of old and complicated accounts ? 7 Peters, 625 ; 1
Martin's Digest, verbo A.ccounts, 405.
Arbitrators, by our code, are to decide according to the strictness of the law. Louisiana Code, 3077, Code of 1b09, p. 442,
art. 12 ; Law of 1805, verbo qccounts ; 1 Martin's Dig. 405.
The interest may well have been due. Suppose that C. Girod,
in his books, charged interest on his accounts with his brothers ; was
he not bound to allow it ?
The prescription may have been proved to have been interrupted by acknowledgment and promises. The interruption is proved
positively by the testimony of Guillot. It was only in the case of
Goddard and Urquhart, in 1834, that the prescriptions under the
Spanish law were established. In Lobdell's case (7 Martin, N.
S., 109), the Supreme Court held, that the prescription of a promissory note, under the Spanish law, was thirty years. It is a mistake
that Claude Girod says in his will that he leaves no debts but to the
amount of $ 30,000. He says, I am indebted to divers persons by
obligations, and little by accounts, in a sum of about $ 30,000.
He may have meant to persdns other than his brothers, - to persons out of his family. Debts, especially old ones, between broth-

ers, are ligtly thought of by debtors; but creditors, have better
memories.
The declarations, indefinite as these, in a man's wil, are bad arguments against the existence of a debt, and no proof at all.
Nor did N. Girod, in his petition for the sale of the property
of Claude Girod's succession in New Orleans) limit the legacies
and debts to $60,000. He says, the amount of legacies and
debts which it is necessary to pay without delay is that sum, or
thereabouts.
Several of the persons who are parties to these suits are itill
Hving ; the respectable counsel for the plaintiff is still at the bar,
and the gentlemen appointed arbitrators were persons whose char.
acters were of the highest consideration.
But this court will enter into no such inquiry in a matter in which
the presumption is omnia acta rite e:se.
Supposing there were no judgments, were not the amounts exhibited to. complainants, when the payments were made to themi
and the will, with its contents, shown to them, and does not the
claim for these amounts resolve itself into a personal action to recover money unlawfully retained, as they allege ? and is not an action of this kind prescribed by ten years, according to complainants' own showing ? Goddard's case, 6 Louisiana R. 660.
It is believed that the grounds of defence to this action are so
obvious, as to require little else from the court than an examination and scrutiny of the facts. To aid in this examination, this
summary has been prepared, and is respectfully submitted.

The appellants assign for errorin the decree rendered against
them in the court below, 1. That there is a total want of equity throughout the complain.
ants' bill, and ih the evidence adduced in support of it.
2. That, under the evidence and allegations of the bill, the conplainants have no claim in a court of equity, by reason of their long
silence, laches, and acquiescence in the ats complained of since
1814.
3. That the cause of action, as set forth by the complainants, is
barred and prescribed by lapse of time under the laws of Louisiana.
4. That the disallowance of the sums of $40,418 and of $8,253,
and the decree concerning the judgments for said amounts, is contradictoryand in violation of law.
5. That the agreements made by two of the complainants with
the defendant in 18.17 are valid, obligatory, and conclusive uponthe
parties ; that the dleclaration of the co-executor, J. F. Girod, has
the same effect.
6. That the discharge of J. F. Girod, the co-executor, destroys

SUPRRME' COURT.
Hichoud et aL

. Girod et al.

.Mr. Jnin,for the appellees, relied upon the following points and
-

authorities.

1. Although the will authorized the executors "to sell, the
property, or cause it to be sold, as to them would seem best for
the heirs of the testator, without the intervention of justice," the
Spanish law, then in force in Louisiana, yet required that the property should be sold at public sale, by order of court, and -after
thirg days' advertisement. Gayoso. v. Garcia, 1 Martin's R.,
N. S, 324.
2. A succession sale, made by the register of wills in the parish
of Orleans (or by the parish judges in the country parishes, who
there perform the functions of the register of wills, Code of 1808,
p. 182, art. 153), is null and void, if not preceded by an order of
the Court of IProbates. Elliott v.Labarre, 2 Louisiana R. 326.'
3. Probate sales, sheriff's sale', or judicial sales of any kind,
can be- set aside by the parties in interest, and treated, as nullities)
if the formalities prescribed by law are not complied with. Psyclb
%'.Psradol, 6 Louisiana R. 166 ; MoDonough v. Gravier's Curator, 9 Louisiana R., and cases there cited.
4. The act of the legislatre of Louisiana, of March 10, 1834,
by which certain irregularities in judicial sales are cured by the
lapse of five years, applies only to- irregularities in the advertisements. Morton v. Reynoldsl 4.Louisiana A.-28;, McCluskey v.
Webb, ibid.. 206. And 'even so:far as -the statute is applicable to
.the facts of this case, it cannot avail the defendants, because it was
not pleaded.c
5. By the civillaw, as well as by the law of chancery, an executor cannot purchase the property of the estate which he administers. Harrod v.Norris's Heirs, 11 Martin's, R. 298 ; Longbot-.

6. The judgments obtained by Nicholas Girod for $ 40,418.09,
sud by J. .Girod for $ 8;253-0, were the result of the frauduleat veoitrivances disclosed by the evidenee. It is well settled, that

the heirs, for they were not parties to them, and the executors did
not represent them or the estate in these proceedings.- These
were indeed judgments without parties. Co-executors are- bound
jointly and severally. Code of 1808, p. 248, art. 177 ; 2 Story's
Eq. Jurisp. Â§Â§ 1280,1281. One of them may act for all. (Same
article of the Code 6f 1808.) They are considered in law'as one
person. 2 Williams's Executors, 620. Hence, if one confess the
action, judgment shall be given against them all. Ibid. 621. And
they cannot sue one another, if they have accepted the trust. Ibid.
685, 818.
8. Though the attorney of the absent heirs was made a party to
these suits, the judgments are not binding on the heirs. The duties of such an attorney are merely conservatory, - be never represents the estate. In cases of mere neglect, and free from fraud,
judgments obtained contradictorily with the attorney of the absent
heir have been treated as nullities. Stein v. Bowman, 9 Louisiana R. 282 ; Collins v. Pease's Heirs, 17 ibid. 1.17. As a
general rule, the courts disregard entirely judgments opposed to
parties who were not cited or not properly represented. 'Psyche
v. Paradol, 6 Louisiana R. 366 ; Marchaud v. Gracie, 2 ibid.
148.
9. The homologation of the account of 1817 is not resjudicata.
It appears, from the petition of the executors, and from the order
thereon., that the heirs were not at all represented in this proceeding'; the executors themselves preferring to represent them. An
attorney was indeed appointed to represent the three heirs of the
Poidebard family, who had not sent their powers of attorney to the
executors, and who were, together, entitled to one sixteenth of the
estate. But they, also, will be relieved from the effects of the homologation Qu account of the fraud of the executors, and the
neglect, if not worse, of the attorney of the absent heirs.
10. The proof of fairness, in dealings between trustee and cestui
que trust, lies upon the former. 8 Cond. Ch. R. 495 ; 1 Story's
Eq. Jurisp. Â§ 218.
11. By the civil law, a purchase, by an executor of the property,
of the estate administered bv himself is radically null, and cannot
be cured by prescription. His possession as'executor is called 5Jn
that system of jurisprudence, a "1precarious " possession ; by no
act of his own can he alter its character; he cannot sell to himself ; notwithstanding an attempted purchase, the law considers his
possession as the precarious possession of an executor, and a precarious possession cannot prescribe by any lapse of time. Macarty v. Bond's Administrator, 9 Louisiana R. 355 ; McCluskey
v. Wbbb, 4 Rob. R. 201 ; Montamat v. Debon, 4 Martin's R.,
N. S., 152; Troplong on Prescription, Nos. 509, 517; 1 Vazeille on Prescription, Nos. 148, 149 ; Pothier's Treatise on Possession, Nos. 64 - 66.

550

SUPREME COURT,
Michoud et al. v. Girod et al.

12. If any prescription was applicable to the purchases of the
executors, it would be the prescription of thirty years, which protects purchasers in bad faith. Code of 1808, p. 486, art. 66;
Code of 1825, art. 3438, 3465 ; Frangois v. Delaronde, 8 Martin's R. 629; Troplong on Prescription, 'Nos. 905-907, 915,
918 ; 21 Durantun, Nos. 352-354.
13. The prescription of ten and twenty years relied on by the
detehdants, that is, of ten years between present, and of twenty
yeass between absent persons, can be pleaded only by those w~ose
possession was acquired, -first, honestly; second, by virtue of a
just title; third, by a title not defective in form. Code of 1808,
p. 486, art. 67 ; Deval v. Choppin, 15 Louisiana Rep. 566
Code of 1825, art. 3442, 3445, 3449 -3454.
But this prescription was not pleaded by the defendants.
14. The only prescription which the defendants plead in their
answer is the prescription of the action of nullity (p. 81 of the
answer). This is a .prescription of ten years, established by art.
204, p. 303, of the Code of 1808, which is literally the same as
article 2218 of the Code of 1825, and article 1304 of the Napoleon Code.
The answer rests this prescription on the receipts given in 1817
by Mine. -Pargoud and Mine. Adam, representing two of the five
branches of heirs on whose behalf this suit has been brought.
The terms of the law show that this prescription applies only to
actions of nullity or rescision to set aside an "1agreement." This
is not an action of nullity, but an action of revendicatioa, or petitory action, which, as bas been seen, is -barred only as. between
absent persons by the prescription of twenty or of thirty years, according as the purchaser was in good or in bad faith.
The receipts were not "'agreements," but an acknowledgmnpt
of the reception of a sum of money, which the executors represented as all that was coming to those two heirs'from the succession.
Even if-these receipts were "1agreements," in the sense of the
article, the right to set them aside would be barred only by the
term of ten years " from the discovery of the fraud." The evidence shows that the complainants had not the slightest knowledge
of the fraudulent acts now proved,, before 1837.
15. The defendants also contend, that these two receipts imply
a ratification of the acts of the executors. The definition and attributes of acts of confirmation and ratification are given in article.
238, p. 310, of the Code of 1808, which is a literal copy of article
1338 of the Napoleon Code, and which was retained in the Code
of 1825 as article 2252.
But no ratification or' confirmation exists in this casei be-

cause, 1st. The original sales, being absolute nuities, are not suscepti-

ble of ratification. If it was the intention of the injured. party to
sanction them, nothing less than a now sale would have teen required to accomplish this object. Acts infected with a radical
nullity cannot be ratified ; they must be made anew. - Solon, Th&.
orie sur la Nullit6, vol. 2, pp. 262, 292, 294; 296, 301, 321,
327, 328, 373 et, seq., 406 ; Troplong on Prescription, n. 90S
-907.
2d. If considered as an express ratification of its fraudulent sales
and judgments, the receipts are inoperative, for they do not contain, in the words of the law (Code of 1808, p. 310, art. 238),
"the mention of the motive of the action of rescission, and the in.
tention of supplying the defect on which that action is founded."
3d. If considered as a tacit ratification, all the authorities concur that all the facts and circuipstances must be fully and completely known, and that the act relied on 'as a tacit ratification can
e susceptible of no oihe6r interpretation. .Rivas's Heirs v. Bernard, 13 Louisiana R. 175, and authorities there cited; Copeland v. Mickie, 17 ibid. 293;,2 Solon, p. 370 ; Perrin, Trait6
des Nullit~s, p. 350.
16. The defendants also rely, in their printed argument, on the
prescription of five years, established by. art.. 3507 of the Code of
1825. This prescription was not pleaded by them:. Had it been,
the answer would be, that it applies, in terms, to "contracts, testaments, and other adts,1' like art. 204, p. 303, of the Code of
1808 ; and that it does not extend to cases of fraud, which are
exclusively provided for in the last-mentioned article.
17. If the case be tested by the rules of chancery, the resale
would be the same.
In chancery, a purchase by a trustee can be cured by lapse of
"fme.
The cases on this subject are nowhere better reviewed than in
Kane v. Blooidgood, 7 Johns. Ch. Rep. 90. But the statute of
limitations begins to run ofly from the open disavowal 6f the trust.
In this case, the possession vas not known to the heirs to be
adverse to the trust, except from the time when they were informed that the sales to Laignel and St. Felix were simulated. Until
thei, they believed the executors to be, as thb executors pretended themselves to be, bona fide purchasers from Laignel and St.
Felix, who, it was believed and represented, were themselves serious purchasers from the estate.
The courts of the United States, sitting as courts of equity,
apply the statutes of limitations of the respective States. 6 Peters,
291 ; 16 Peters, 455, 495 ; 11 Peters, .369, 393,.406.
When the statute limits not at law, the same length of time is
not a bar in equity. Boone v. Chiles, 10 Peters, -177 ; Cook v.
Ankam, 6 Cond. Rep. 287; Baker v. 'Whiting, 3 Sumner, 486.
" In a case of trusts of lands, nothing short of the statute peri-

W2

od which would bar a legal estate or right of entry would be permitted to operate in equity as a bar of the equitable estate."
Judge Story, in Baker v. Whiting, 3 Sumner's Rep. 486.
It has been seen that no other prescription but that of tr
years would, by the law of Louisiana, bar the action of revendication.
Nothing is better settled, in the law of chancery, than that, in
cases of fraud, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until a full discovery of the- frauds practised. Boone v. Chiles, 10
Peters, 223 ; Aylward v. Keamey, 2 Ball & Beat. 476 ; Murray
v. Palmer, 2 Sch. & Lef. 486 ; Hovenden v. Lord Anndsley,

1 Hovenden on Frauds, 480 ; Croft v. Adm'rs of Townsend, 3
Dess. 239 ; Wamburzee v. Kennedy, 4 Dess. 474, 485, 489;
Randall v. Errington,-10 Ves. 423.
And vague rumors. and reports do not constitute that kind of
knowledge of the fraud which will give course to the statute of limitations. Flagg '.
-Mann, 2 Sumner, 491, 551, 563 ; Irby v.
M'Crae, 4 Dess. 431 ; Randall v. Errington, 10 Ves. 423 ; 11
Louisiana R. 139 ; Conway v. Williams's Adm'r, 10 ibid. 568;
Tyson v. McGill, 15 ibid. 145.
The acquiescence and ratification of two of the complainants is
attempted to be inferred from their receipts. These parties assuredly knew nothing of the frauds of the executors when they
signed the receipts, and acted with blind confidence. In equity,
as long as the injured p1arty does not know the full extent of his
rights, and that the transaction is impeachable, any act done by him
subsequently will not amount to a ratification or confirmation. As
long as the dependence of the cestui quc trust upon the trustee and
the fiduciary relation continues, an alleged ratification will always
be scrutinized with the utmost jealousy; and a party possessing
only imperfect information cannot be held guilty of laches. 1 Stokry's Equity, Â§ 345 ; Butler v. Haskell, 4 Dess. 651, 709 (where

Mr. Justice WAYNE delivered the opinion of the court.
The conclusions to which we have come in this cause do not
require from us any comment upon its facts.
We concur with the learned judge in the Circuit Court, in setting aside the purchases by which Nicholas Girod and Jean Francois Girod became the possessors of their testator's entire estate.

553

Michoud et al. v. Girod et at.

But the morality pnd policy of the law, qs. it is administered ki
courts of 6quity, induce us to add, that thos purchases were
fraudulent and void, and may :be declared to- be so, without any.
further inquiry, upon the ground that they.were made by the intertrention of persons -who were nominal buyers of the property for
the purpose of conveying it to the executors. Such a transaction
carries fraud upon th face of it. Lord Hardwicke v. Vernon, 4
Ves. jun. 411 ; 14'Ves. jun. 504 ; 2. Bro. C. C. .410,note. It
matters not, in such a case, whether the sales are made with ,o
without the sanction of judicial authority, or with ministerial einetness. The rule of equity is, in every code of juisprudenee with
which we are acquainted, that a purchase by a trustee or agent ot
the particular property of-which he--has the sale, or in which he
represents another, whether he has an interest in it or not,-pw
interpoitam personam, --- carries fraud on the face of it. In OlU
instance, Laignel and St. Felix *ere the instruments. of tfe executors. They bid off the property, paid nothing, received ii

In this way Nicholas Girod became the purchaser of all the testa.
tor's property in New Orleans, and himself and his brother Jean
Frano~is, the other executor, were joint- purchasers of: the. lan&
and slaves in the parish of Assumption, and of the testator's lands.
elsewhere. Jean Frauois, some years afterwards, sold out his
half of their joint purchase to Nicholas, for seventy thousand dollars. Thus the latter became the possessor of the entire estate,1
and held it until he died, to the exclusion of all the other testamentary heirs. Some of those heirs, and the represefitatives of
others of them, now sue the representatives of Nicholas Girod,
and seek to set aside the purchases of the executors. They allege that they, were fraudulently made, ask that they may hawe
assigned to them their respective portions of the estate, with an
account of rents and profits excepting from their claim for the lat-ter the moiety which had been received by Jean Fran~ois Girod.
The defendants reply, and deny fraud in fact or in intention on the
part of the executors. They declare, that the sales were judicially
ordered and conducted, that the purchases were 'rightfully made,
for a fair price, at public auction, that the complainants have no
standing in a court of equity by reason of their long silence, laches,
and acquiescence in the acts of which they complain, and that .
their rights are barred by lapse of time, under the laws of Louisiana. They also say, that receipts or acquittances were given to
the executors by two of the complainantsi which are valid and obligatory upon them. The bill and answers, and the argumeilts of
the learned counsel for the appellants, then, involve, the question
of the right of executors to purchase any part of the estate which
they administer, for a fair price, at a public sale judicially ordered

tor is in equity a trustee for heirs, legatees, and creditors, we proceed to give our opinion of the law in respect to purchases of the
estate represented by them, and of purchases made by other trustees
and agents, and all persons gui ne,,otia alienagerunt. The rule as
to persons incapable of purchasing particular property except under
particular restraints, on account of the rules of equity, is compendiously given by Sir Edward Sugden, in his second section of purchases. by trustees, agents, &c. It has been adopted 'by almost
every subsequent writer, and we cite -the passage with confidence,
having verified its correctness by an examination of all the cases
cited by him ; by an examination, also, of other cases in the English courts, ana of cases in the courts of chancery of several of
the States in our Union, sustaining the doctrine, to the fullest extent, of the incapability of-trustees and agents to purchase particular property, for the sale of which they act representatiely, or in
whom the title may be for another. He says, --- " It may be laid
down as a general proposition, that trustees, -unless
they are
nominally such to preserve contingent remainders, - agents, commissioners of bankrupts, assignees of bankrupts, solicitors to the
commission, auctioneers, creditors who have been consulted'as to
the mode Qf sale, or any persons who, by their connection with any
other person, or by being employed or concerned in his affairs,
have acquired a knowledge of his property, are incapable of purchasing, such property themselves, except under the restraints
which will shortly be mentioned. For if persons having a confidential character were permitted to avail themselves of any knowledge acquired in that capacity, they might be induced to conceal

The general rule stands upon our great moral obligation to refrain from placing ourselves in relations which ordinarily excite a
conflict between self-interest and integrity. It restrains all agents,
public and private ; but the value of the prohibition is most felt,
and its application is more frequent, in the private relations in which
the vendor and purchaser may stand towards each other. The disability to purchase is a consequence of that relation between them
which imposes on the one a duty to protect the interest of the
other, from the faithful discharge of which duty his own personal.
interest may withdraw him. In this conflict of interest, the law
wisely interposes. It acts not on the possibility, that, in some
cases, the sense of that duty may prevail over the motives of selfinterest, but it provides against the probability in manyvases, and
the danger in all cases, that the dictates of self-interest will exercise
a predominant influence, and supersede that of duty. It therefore prohibits a party from purchasing on his own account that
which his duty or trust requires him'to sell on acdount of another,
and from purchasing on account of another that which he sells on
his own account. In effect, he is not allowed to unite the two opposite characters of buyer and seller, because his interests, when
he is the seller or buyer on his own account, are directly conflicting
with those of the person on whose account he buys or sells. 2
Burge's Comm. 459. Cases have been frequently decided in the
courts of Louisiana, which maintain the rule in all its integrity. In
Pehnsylvania it is enforce&, though, on looking over its reports, we
find a case, but unsustained by any reference to adjudged cases, in
which it is said that an executor might buy at a sale of the testator's effects, if he did so for a fair price, at public auction. In
Maryland, the courts of chancery carry out the rule to the fullest extent of the principles upon which it is founded, and as they have-just
been stated byus. In the case of Wormley v. Wormley, 8 Wheat.
421, this court declared, that no rule is better settled, than that a
trustee cannot become the purchaser of the trust estate. He cannot be, at the same time, vendor and vendee. It had been previously ruled, in the case of Prevost v. Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481, and
this court afterwards, in Ringo et al. v. Binns et al., reaffirmed the'
rule, by its application to an agent who had bought land to which

556

,SUPREME COURT.
Michoud et al. r. Girod et al.

his principal was in equity entitled. It said, " The proposition laid
down by' this court is, that if an agent discovers a defect in the title
of his- principal t6 land, he cannot misuse it to acquire a title for
himself ; and if he does, that he will be held as a trustee holding
for his principal." 10 Pet. 269, 281. See also the case of Oliver
v. Piatt, 3 How. 333. It is also affirmed, in Church v. Marine
Insurance Company, 1 Mason, 341, that an agent or trustee cannot, directly or indirectly, become the purchaser of the trust property
which is confided to his care. We scarcely need add, that a purchase by a trustee of his cetui que trust, 8uijuris, provided it is
deliberately agreed or understood between them that the relation
shall be considered as dissolved, "and there is a clear contract,'
ascertained to be such, -after a jealous and scrupulous .examination
of all the circumstances, and it is clear that the cestui que trust
intended that the trustee 'should buy, and there is no fraud, no
concealment, and no advantage taln by the trustee of information
acquired by him as trustee," will b6 sustained in a court of equity.
But it is difficult to make out such a case, where the exception is
taken, 6specially when. there is any inadequacy of price, or any
inequality in the bargain. Coles v. Trecothick, 9 Ves. 246 ; Fox
v. Mackreth,'2 Bro. Ch. R. 400; Gikson v. Jeyes, 6 Ves. 277 ;
Whichcote v. Lawrence, 3 Ves. 740; Campbell v. Walker, 5
Ves. 678 ; Ayliffe v. Murray, 2 Atk. 59. And therefore, if a
trustee, though strictly honest, should buy for himself an estate
from his cestui que trust, and then should sell it for more, according
to the rules of a court of equity, from general policy, and not from
any peculiar imputation of fraud, he would be held still to remain a
,trustee to all intents and purposes, and not be permitted to sell to
or for himself. 1 Story's Com. on Equity (2d ed.) 317 ; Fox v.
Mackreth, 2 Bro. Ch. R. 400; S. C., 2 Cox, 320, 327,
In New York there has been no relaxation of it, since the decision
in the case of Davoue v. Fanning, 2 Johns. Ch. 252. It is a critical
and able review of the doctrine, as it had been applied by the English
courts of chance.y from an early day, and has been received, with very
few exceptions, by our State chancery courts, as altogether putting
the rule upon its proper footing. Indeed, it is not too much to say,
that it has secured the triumph of the rule over all qualifications and
relaxations of it in the United States, to the same extent that had
5een achieved for it in England by that great chancellor, Lord
Eldon. Davoue v. Fanning was the case of an executor for whose
wife a purchase had been made by one Hedden, at public auction,
bon4 fide, for a fair price, of a part of the estate which Fanning
administered, and the prayer of the bill was, that the purchase
might be set aside, hnd the premises resold. The case was examined with a special reference to the right of an executor to buy
any part of the estate of his testator. And it was affirmed, and we
think rightly, that if a trustee, or person'acting for others, sells the

JANUARY

TERM, 1846.

557

Michoud et &L.v. Girod et al.

trust estate, and becomes himself interested in the purchase, the
testuis que trust are entitled, as of course, to have the purchase
set aside, and the property re~xposed to sale, under the direction
of the court. And it makes no difference in the application of the
rule, that 'a sale was at public auction, bona fide, and for a fair
price, and that the executor did not purchase fQr himsel4but that a
third pers6n, by previous arrangement -with the executor, became
the purchaser, to hold in trust for the separate us and benefit of
the wife of the executor, who was one of the cestuis que trust, and
who -bad an interest in the land tinder the will of the testator. The
inquiry, in such a case, is not whether there was or was not fraud
in fact. The purchase is void, and will be set aside at the instance
of the cestui que trust, and a resale ordered, on the ground of the
temptation to abuse, and of the danger of imposition ina6cessible
to the eye of the court. We are aware that cases may be found,
in the reports of some of the chancery courts in the United States,
in which it has been held that an executor may purchase, if it be
without fraud, any property of his testator, at open and public sale,
for a fair price, and that such purchase is only voidable, and not
void, as we hold it to be.- But with all due respect for the learned
judges who have so decided, we say that an executor or administrator is, in equity, a trustee for the next of kin, legatees, and
creditors, and that we have been unable to find any one well considered de6ision, with other cases, or any one case in the books, to
sustain the right of an executor to 'become the purchaser of the
property which he represents, or any portion of it, though he has
done so for a fair price, without fraud, at a public sale. Why
should the rule be relaxed in the case of persons most frequently
exposed ,to the temptations of self-interest, who may yield to it
more readily than any others, with a larger impunity, if the day of
equitable retribution shall ever come for those'who have been defrauded ? Is it not better that the cause of the evil shall be prohibited, than that courts of equity shall be relied tipon to apply the
remedy in particular cases, by inquiring into all the circumstances
of a case, whether there has or has not been fraud in fact ? Is the
rule to be relaxed, in the case of executors, in respect to all persons
interested in the estate, or only to such of them as are sui juris .2
And if only to those who are sui juris, why in case of an executor as to such persons, when the rule has never been relaxed by any
court of equity to permit purchases by any other trustee or agent
of one who is sui jurii? Shall it be relaxed in cases of those
who are interested in the estate, and who are not sui juris or minors ? Then othey remedies must be devised to protect their
interests than'that which experience has shown to be alone efficacious. It is, that when a trustee for one not sui juris sees that it
is absolutely necessary that the estate must be sold, and he is ready.

and he should apply to the court by motion, to let him be a purchaser.
Tfiis is the only way he can protect himself. There are cases in
which the court wXl permit it. Campbell v. Walker, 5 Ves. jun.
478 ; 13 Ves. jun. 601; I Ball & Beatty, 418.
Such is the proceeding adopted in Louisiana, when property in
which a minor is interested is offered for sale, as may be seen by
the case in 5 Louisiana R. 16, McCarty v. Steam Cotton Press
Company et al. The property was sold at auction, and the mother
of the minor became the purchaser. It was contended that this
purchase was null and void, because the property had descended to
the children immediately after the death of the father, and the mother, who, by the effect of the law, was. their natural tutor, could not
buy it. The court said it was a general rule. But it having been
shown that the mother and purchaser had petitoned the Court of
Probates for a iatification of the sale, and that the court had ratified
it upon the advice of a family meeting, the sale was confirmed.
And the court held, that under the Spanish law (20) a tutor
could purchase the property of his ward, with the permission of the
judo.
We have said more upon the relaxation of the rule in the case of
executors thap we would have done, if the learned c6unsel for the
appellantd had not pressed, as an exemption from the rule, purchases
made by executors without fraud at open sale, especially when by
the will they were empowered to sell the estate of their testator for
thebenefit of heirs and legatees, and were heirs or legatees themselves.
And if it had not been urged, that the decisions of the Supreme
Court of Louisiana were unsafe guides in interpreting the Spanish
laws in respect to .the incapacity of persons to purchase at judicial
sales particular property, on account of the official or financiering relation in which they stood, to the persons who owned the property.
It was supposed that the qualifications of the rule by.the civil law embraced executors, or might do so by the "eason upon which those qualifications were sustained. It imposes'apon us the task of showing,
that the relaxations of the rule by the civil law were never permitted
by the Spanish law which prevailed in Louisiana, and were never
extended under the civil law, to permit the executor testamentarius
or executor dativus to buy the property which he was appointed to
administer. It is a subject of curious and instructive exan ination
to trace the rule or prohibition, in the course of its application under.
the jurisprudence of different nations. In all of them, there. were
limited ad occasional relaxations of the rule in particular cases,
in what are sometimes called hard cases, but in no one nation have
purchases by executors been permitted, as a relaxation of the civil
law rule. For a general historical examination of the subject, we
have not time ; we wish we had. A brief examination, however, of
the qualifications of the rule. by the ciil law will, not be inappropriate upon an appeal from a court held in Louisiana, where the civil

JANUARY TERM, 1846.
Michoud et al v.

559

irod et al.

law exists in a modified form, and is still often the rule of decision
by its 6nlightened jurists. The prohibition of the civil law is thus
expressed : -"
Tutor rem pupili emere non potest ; idemque porrigentdum est ad similia, id est, ad curatores, procuratores, et qui
negotia aliena gerunt." Dig., Lib. 18 tit. 1, 1. 34 ; Inst., Lib.
1, tit. 21, 23.
The rule as expressed embraces every relation in which there
may arise a conflict between the duty which the vendor or purchaser owes to the person with whom he is dealing, or on whose
account he is acting, and, his own individual interest. Nor was it
ever relaxed oi qualified by the civil law, further than to allow the
guardian to purchase the property of the 'Ward, palam et bona fide,
at public auction. "Cum ipse tutor nihil ex -bonis pupilli, quo
distrahi possunt,. comparare' palam et bona fide prohibetur ; multo
magis uxor ejus hoc facere potest."' Cod., Lib. 4, tit. 38, L 5.
But foreseeing the mischief which might grow out of the relaxation,
it required that the purchase must be made by the guardian himself,
-palamet bona fide, and not per interpositampersonam.
Sed si
per interpositam personam rem pupilli emerit, in ea causa ut emptio
nuUius momenti sit, quia non bona fide videtur rem gessisse. Et ita
es rescriptum a D. Severo et Antonino." Dig., Lib. 26, tit. 5,1. 5,
Â§ 3. A purchase by a guardian from his co-guardian was permitted, if it took place in public, and bona fide. "Item ipse tutor et
emptoris et venditoris officio fungi non potest. Sed enim si contutorem habeat, cujus auctoritas sufficit, procul-dubio emere potest.
Sod si mali fide emptio intercesserit, nullius erit momenti, ideoque
nec usucapere potest. Sanei si sun mtatis factus comprobaverit
emntionem, contractus valet." Dig., Lib. 26, tit. 8' 1. 5, Â§ 2.
The guardian might purchase at a sale made at the suit of a
creditor. " Si creditor pupilhi distrahat, aque emere bona fide
potent." Dig., Lib. 26, 1. 5, Â§ 5. Such is the extent of the
qualification of the rule of the civil law. And, its limitation not
being well understood, persons have often been misled to apply it to
what they supposed to be analogous agencies, such as executors,
when there was no authority either in the text of the civil law, or in
the practice under it, for doing s6. But, further, those qualifications
of the rule mentioned were confined in practice to those territories.
in Europe in which the civil law prevailed without modificauon.
And it is remarkable, considering what were the influences upon
Christendom of the civil law, after its discovery- in the twelfth
century, - and when not until some time after it began to be used as
a rule of law by which public and private rights were determined,
when'in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it was the study of the
wisest men, - it is remarkable that the qualifications of the rule, as
they have been stated, *ere considered imperfections, and were
rejected by every n~tion in Europe whose codes -are generally ad.
nitred to have been compiled from the civil law, with an intimate

knowledge of human nature, as it has always shown its,-lf in the
business of life. Here, appropriate to what has been just said, is
the language of Pothier. "Nous ne pouvons acheter, ni par nousmemes, ni par personnes interposes, les choses que font partie des
biens dont nous avons l'administration ; ainsi un tuteur ne pent
acheter les choses qui appartiennent . son mineur ; un administrateur ne peut acheter aucune chose de bien dont ila l'administtion."1
Tr. du Contrat de Vente, part. 1,n. 13. The rule of the civil
law, without qualification, is adopted in the codes of Holland.
"Qua vero de tutoribus cautA, eaquoque in curatoribus, procuratoribus, testamentorum executoribus, aliisque similibus, qui aliena gerunt
negotia, probanda sunt.". Voet., Lib. 18, tit. 1, n. 9 ; 2 Burge's
Comm. 463. In Spain, the rule was enforced without relaxation,
and with stem uniformity. Judge McCaleb cites in bis opiniony
from the'Novissinma Recopilacion, therule, in the following words.
11 No man, who is testamentary executor or guardian. of minors, nor
any other man or woman, can purchase the property which they administer, and whether they purchase publicly or privately the act is
invalid, and on proof being made of the fact, the sale must be set
aside." This was the 1Itw of Louisiana when ther executors in
this instance made their ',urchases, and it is conclusive of the invalidity.
We have thus shown, that those purchases are fraudulent and
void, from having been made per interpositam personam, and if
they were not so on that account, that they are void by the rule in
equity in the courts of' England, and as it prevails in the courts of
equity in the United States. It has also been shown, that they
are void by the law of Louisiana, as it was when they were made
b7 the executors, and that such purchases never were countenanced in that State by any. qualification of the civil law rule prohibiting purchases by those who stood in such fiduciary relations
to others ; that the act could not be generally done, without creating a conflict between self-interest and integrity. In every aspect
in which we have viewed this case, we are called upon to direct
that the purchases made by Nicholas and Jean Frangois Girod
of their testator's estate should be set aside. We shall order
it to be done. Nor do we think that the complainants have lost
their rights by negligence, or by the lapse of time. We can only
see in their conduct the fears and forbearance of dependent relatives, far distant from the- scene of the transactions of which they
complain, desirous of having what was due to them, and suspecting it had been withheld, but unwilling to believe that they had been
wronged by brothers, with whom they had been associated in a
common interest by another brother who was dead. In a case. of
actual fraud, courts of- equity give relief after a long lapse of time,
much longer than has -passed since the executors, in this instance,
purchased their testator's estate. In general, length of time is no

JANUARY TERM, 1846.

561

Michoud et al. v. Girod et al.

bar to a trust clearly established to have once existed ; and where
fraud is imputed and proved, length of time ought not to exclude
relief. Prevost v. Gratz, 6 Wheat. 481. Generally speaking,
when a pdrty has been guilty of such laches in prosecuting his equitable title as would bar him if his title were solely at law, he will be
barred in equity, from a wise consideration of the paramount importance of quieting men's titles, and upon the principle that expedit rcipublicte ut sit finis litium ; although the statutes of limitations do not apply to any equitable demand, courts of equityadopt them ; or at least generally take the same limitations for
their guide, in eases analogous to those in which the statutes apply
at law. 10 Ves. 467 ; 1 Cox, 149. Still, within what time a
constructive trust will be barred must, depend -upon the circumstances of the case. Boone v. Chiles, 10 Peters, 177. There is
no rule in equity which excludes the consideration of circumstances, and, in a case of actual fraud, we believe no case can be found
in the books in which a court of equity has refused to give relief
within the lifetime of either of the parties upon whom the fraud is
proved,' or within thirty years after it has been discovered or becomes known to the party whose -rights are affected by it. In
this case, that time has not elapsed since the executors made their
purchases, and it is not pretended that they were known to any of
the complainants until the- year 1817, and not then, except by the
exhibition of an account by the executors .to some of the complainants, with declarations that every thing bad been fairly done
with a view to save the honor of the testator, and the interests of
tho'se who were the 'objects of his bounty. In' this view of the
case, it is not necessary for us to consider the time within which
remedies are barred, or property may be acquired by prescription,
under the laws of Louisiana. We would willingly otherwise do
so, for the result would show the'sanm harmony in the application
of the rules of the civil law and those of Louisiana upon prescription with the rules prevailing in courts of equity in England and
the United States, as we trust has been shown to exist between
them in the prohibition of an executor to buy the estate of his testator.
The receipts or acquittances given by two of the complainants to
the executors do not affect their rights. They were obviously
give; without full knowledge of all the circumstances connected
with the disposal and management of the estate. Indeed, it is
plain that such information had been withheld by the executors.
It is true that an account was presented to them, with official signatures to it, but without vouchers of any kind to verify its correctness, and it was accompanied by a letter from Nicholas Girod,
in which menaces of displeasure are mingled with intimations of
future kindness.
We shall also direct the official proceedings which were had

upon the account of Nicholas Girod, against the estate of Claude,
to be set aside and annulled. But there will be allowed to the
representatives of Nicholas, in the settlement of the estate, the sum
of $ 6,574-20, with interest at five per -cent. The proofs in the
cause show that, a few months before* the death -of, he- testator,
there had been a settlement of accounts between him and Nicholas,
and we allow that amount, as it is charged'in the general account)
disallowing all the other items. We suppose it to be an inadver-,
tency in drawing up the deciee, that the sum just mentioned was
not allowed, as the learned judge, in his opinion, states that a set-,
tlement had taken place, with that result.
We shall also direct that the actual cost of all permanent improvements which were made upon any part of the estate by Nicholas Girod shall be allowed to his representatives, with interest .at
five per cent. in the settlement which shall be made with the complaihants and the other~persons having an interest under the will of
Claude. And also an allowance for taxes, and the expenses and
cost paid in recovering the property gained by alluvion. A reference to a master will be directed. We regret to perceive from
the record, that all the persons who are interested in the estate of
Claude F. Gipod are not parties to this proceeding. We shall direct, that they shall be permitted to make themselves parties, if they
please to become. so. But in giving the order, it is not intended to
delay those fron receiving their portions in whose behalf this decree is made. The fruits of their vigdance can be apportioned
according to their respective rights in the estate, when one of the
original testamentary heirs claims, and the Circuit Court, ih the
further proceedings in the cause under the mandate of this court,
will of course take care to ascertain who are the representatives of
others of them who are dead.
Jean Francois Girod is not-auparty in this cause, and therefore
we can give no decree against him, but should he offer to become
a party for the purpose of claiming What under the will was his
portion of the estate of Claude, or should it be claimed by any
representative of his, we think'it right to remark, for the purpose
of preventing further litigation in this matter, that such claim will
be subject to all the equities subsisting between Jean Frangois and
Nicholas, and especially.to the allowance to the representatives of
Nicholas of the purchase money which was given by Nicholas-to
Jean, for the one half of their joint purbhase of the property oftheir testator, with interest at the rate according to their contract
up to the times when the purchase money was paid, and afterwards at five per cent.

trict of Louisiana; and was argued by counsel. "Wereupon it is
considered by the court, 1. That the plaintiffs are residuary legatees of Claude Francois
Girod, deceased, in the following proportion, namely: Peronne
Bernardine Girod, the widow of Jean Pierre Hector Pargoud, for
one eighth-; Rosalie Girod, the widow of Louis Adam, for one.
eighth ; Frangoise Peronne Quiitand, the wife of J. A. Allard, for
one forty-eighth ; Marie Philippine Rose Quitand, for one fortyeighth ; Marie Bernard Quitand, for one forty-eighth; Louis Joseph Poidebard, for one forty-eighth ; Benoite Collihie Nicoud, for
two two-hundred-and-eighty-eighths ; Maurice Emilie Nicoud, and
Jenny Benoite Nicoud, represented by Jean Berger, their tutor, each for two two-hundred-and-eighty-eighths ; Jean Franois
Girod, the nephew, in his own right, *and as testamentary heir of
Pierre Nicholas Girod, his brother, and represented by Jean Firman
Pepin, the syndic of his creditors, for one twentieth ; and FranIoise Clementine Girod, wife of Pierre Francois Pernond, for one
fortieth.
2. That the adjudication of landed property, with the slaves
thereto attached, situated on Bayou Laf6urche, made on the 18th
of February, 1814, to Charles St. Felix ; the retrocession of said
property by said Charles St. Felix to Nicholas and Jean Ftaucois

property situated in the parish of Orleans made to Simon
ignei
on the 9th of April, 1814, and the notarial seal made to the same
on the 26th of April, 1814, in pursuance of said adjudication ; and
the conveyance of said property to Nicholas Girod, of the 28th of
April, 1814, be set aside and annulled, saving, however, the just
rights of third persons, to whom two tracts of land on Bayou Lafourche, two slaves, and a piebe of ground in the city of New
Orleans were conveyed by the said Nicholas Girod in his lifetime,
as appears from the admissions in the pleadings.
S. That for the purpose of giving to the residuary legatees of
the late Claude Francois Girod their proportions respectively of
the estate of the testator, the said Circuit Court should direct either
a sale of the said property, both real and personal, at such time and
manner as said court shall see fit, or cause a partition in kind to be
made of said property, as in the judgment of the said court might be
deemed most advisable ; and that in either case the said court
should direct all the proper conveyances to be made accordingly.

to the plaintiffs ai aforesaid, is all the property and slaves which
were inventoried in the parishes of Ascension, Assumption, and
