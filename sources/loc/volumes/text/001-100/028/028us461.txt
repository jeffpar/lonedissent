William Thomas Carroll, Esquire, Clerk of the Supreme Court of the United'
States.
SIR,

The governor and attorney general of the state of New York were reiently
served with th6 coly of'a bill in equity, said to have been exhibitedin the.supreme court of the United States, by "The State of New Jers6y vs.The ffeople
of the State of New York," and with a subpoena in that cause to appear on the
first Monday of August next.
Lbegleave respectfully to sak, that such service is'regarded on the-part of thb
st te of New Yqrk as utterly void; because the mode adopted is unknownto the
common-law; isnot authorised by any statute of theUnited Statqs, nor warranted
by any existing rule or order of the court out of which the ptocess issued. A
rule on the subject of the'service of process wis adopted in August.term 1796,
.A Dall. Rep. 3201 335; but this rule, so.far 'as I have observed, has been.
omitted in every subsequeit publication of the rules of the supreme court; and
is no doubt obsolte.
Entertaining this view of the subject, it Is supposed that no -proebding will
be had inthe cause, either in vacation or at term, until the court shall-hav?
directed the inode of serving such process, and the prescribed course ihall h.2&
been pursued.
Whether the court-has been clothed with power to-compel the appearance of
a'state as defendant in an original suit or pro'ceeding, is a~question, among"
-others, which will no doubj receive from that high tribunal ali
the considerationthat its importance demands, before any order shall be made in the premises.
I vyill thank you to hand-this to the court, if the subject shall ever be presented
to their conslderatibn,' and shoildany yule-or order be made in; or affecting.this
cause, pleise send'a certified copy', addres.sed to ne at Albany.*

forthwith served on the governor, and on the attorney general of the state of New York; and on the day assigned by
the court, the 6th of March 1830, Mr Southard, attorney
general of the state of New Jersey, and Mr Wirt, attended
as counsel for the complainants. No counsel appeared for
the state of New York.'
The counsel for the state of New Jersey inquired of the
court if they would hear an argument on the motion'that a
subpcnna might.issue to be served. on the governor and atto rney general of the state of New York, stating that they
were willing and prepared to go into the same.
.Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL said, as no one appears toargue the motion on the part of the state -of New York, and
'the precedent for granting ,the process has been established
upon very grave and solemn argument, in the case .of Chisholm vs. The State of Georgia, 2..Dall. Rep. 419, and Grayson vs. The State of Virginia, 8 Dall. 320, the court do not
think it proper to require an ex parte argument in favour
of their authority to grant the subpoena, but will follow the
precedent heretofore established.
The court "arc the more disposed to adopt this course, as
the state of New York will still be at liberty to contest the
I bEg leave respectfully to say, that the. opinion is entertained on the part of
the slate of New York, that this*court cannot excrcisd jurisdiction in such a case,
without the authority of an act of cdngress for carrying into execution that part
of the judicial power of the United States which extends to controversies
between two or-more states.
The governor of the state of New York has made a communication upon the
subject of this suit to the legislature now in session ; but it has not yet been
acted upon, so far as I have.been advised. Whether the legislature will autho.
rise any person to appear and 'discuss the question ofjurisdiction; or whether,
for the purpose of obtaining a judicial decision upon-the merits of an unfortunate
controversy, they will order an aplpearance, waiving the question ofjurisdiction,
I am, at this time, unable to determine.
I have deemed it proper to make this communication, to explain what might
otherwise be supposed a want of respect for this It.nourable court,-on the part of
the executive of New'York.

proceeding at a future'time in the course of the cause, if it
shall chbose. to insist upon the objection.
On consideration of the motion made by Messrs Southari
and Wirt, solicitors for the complainant in this cause, on
Saturday the 13th day of February of the present term of this
court, praying the court to l ostpone the consideration of this
cause until Saturday the 6th of March of the present term
of this court, with- leave to the counsel for'the said complainant on that day either to argue the point of jurisdiction,
or to move the court for a decree in pursuance of'the notice
therein.recited, or for new process in case the codirt should
determine that the service of the process in this case was not
sufficient to entitle the court to proceed against the state
of New York, or for such -ther order as to the court may
seem meet: it is considered by the court, that as no one
appears to argue this motion on the part of the state of.New
York, and the -precedent has been established in the case of
Chisholm's- Executors against the State of Georgia, the
court do not consider it proper to require an ex parte argument, but will follow the precedent so established after
grave and solemn argument. The court is the more disposed to adopt this course, as the state of New York will-be
at liberty to contest this proceeding at any time in the course
of the cause. Whereupon it is ordered by the court that,
6s the service of the former process in this cause was defective, inasmuch as it was not served sixty days before the
-return day thereof, as required by the rules of this court,
