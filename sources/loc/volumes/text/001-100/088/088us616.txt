JACKSON V. LUDELING.

[Sup. Ct.

Syllabus.

It is a sufficient answer to this criticism that no objection of
the kind was made to the decree in the court below, nor was
its validity questioned. The presumption is, in the absence
of such objection, that an answer existed which would have
been made had the objection been taken. The decree was
admitted in evidence, and the decision of the court was placed
on the ground that the provisions of the act of Congress did
not interfere with proceedings by attachment, in the State
court, nor affect the liability of an insolvent corporation to
be thus sued, and "that matter of abatement could not be
given in evidence on an issue upon the merits, a default,
or a failure to plead;" the court apparently considering the
abatement of the attachment, and not the abatement of the
suit, as the object sought by the production of the decree.
JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND THE CAUSE REMANDED,

with di-

rections to discharge the attachment levied on the property
of the bank.

JACKSON v. LUDELING.
1. When two or more persons have a common interest in a security, equity
will not allow one to appropriate it exclusively to himself, or to impair
its worth to the others. Community of interest involves mutual obligation. If, ex. gr., a corporation issue many bonds and give a mortgage
on all its estates to secure them, one holder of the bonds-admitting
that he has a right to make use of the mortgage to enforce the payment
of the bonds which he holds-has no right to employ it as an instrument
by which he may become the owner of the property mortgaged at the
lowest price at which it can be obtained, leaving the bonds held by his
associate holders unpaid. His duty, if he uses it at all, is to make it
productive of the most that can be obtained for all who are interested in
it, and if he seek to make a profit out of it at the expense of those whose
rights in it were the same as his own, he is guilty of fraud.
2. The managers and officers of a company where capital is contributed in
shares, are in a very legitimate sense trustees, alike for its stockholders
and its creditors, though they may not be trustees technically and in
form. They accordingly have no right to enter into or participate in
any combination, the object of which is to divest the company of its
property and obtain it for themselves at a sacrifice; they have no right

to seek their own profit at the expense of the company, its stockholders,
or even its bondholders. Contrariwise, in case of embarrassment to the
company, and any necessity to sell the estates of the company, it is their
duty, to the extent of their power, to secure for all those whose interests
are in their charge, the highest possible price for the property which can
be obtained for it.
8. These principles applied to a case where the local managers and officers
of an embarrassed railroad, holding a small portion of its bonds, of
which a much greater portion was held by non-residents, got an order
of sale under a mortgage to secure the bonds, and proceeded in a hasty
and rather secret way to sell it, and to buy it at a price much below
its value, for themselves; the conditions of sale being made such as to
render it difficult for persons generally to purchase; and the whole proceeding of sale being attended also with evidences of gross disregard of
the interests of the bondholders generally, and of course of the stockholders.
4. The statute of Louisiana of March 10th, 1884, which authorizes purchasers at a sheriff's sale to apply for a monition to all persons interested
who can set up any right, title, or claim to the property described, in
consequence of any informality in the order, or decree, or judgment of
the court under which the sale was made, or any irregularityor illegality
in the appointment and advertisement in time or manner of sale, or for
any other defect whatsoever, to show cause why the sale should not be
confirmed and homologated, and which, if no cause be shown, makes
judgment of confirmation conclusive on the world, has relation to mistakes or omissions of the officers of the law, and not any relation to the
question whether the purchasers have obtained their title by fraud, or
whether they are trustees mald fie for others. Accordingly, a judgment of homologation under it is conclusive of nothing but that there
have been no fatal irregularities of form.

The complainants were holders of six hundred and sixty,

General statement of the case.

out of seven hundred and sixty-one, bonds of $1000 each,
issued by the said company, and secured by a mortgage upon
the railroad and its appurtenances, and upon the franchises
and personal effects of the company, together with more than
four hundred thousand acres of land. Their bill was filed as
well for themselves as for all other bondholders whose situation was similar to theirs. Some of them were also preferred
stockholders of the company to a large amount. The mortgage was made by an authentic act on the 1st day of September, A.D. 1857, to John Ray, or bearer, to secure the
full, faithful, and punctual payment and redemption of each
and all the bonds issued under it to any and all the future
holders thereof, and to each and every one of them, when
the same should become due and payable, together with the
interest accruing thereon. The relief sought by the bill was
that the mortgage might be declared to be a valid lien upon
all the property described therein; that a sale averred to
have been made under it in 1866, to the defendant Ludeling
and his said associates, be set aside, and the deed made
to them by the sheriff be declared to be fraudulent and
void; that the defendants might be enjoined against setting
up any title under the sale and the deed; prohibited from
selling any of the property, rights, and privileges of thE,
railroad company, and required to account for all money
received by them on account of the corporation, and that
the mortgaged property might be decreed to be sold for the
benefit of the bondholders, the preferred and other stockholders. The bill also prayed for the appointment of a
receiver and for other relief.
To the bill and the relief asked, the defence set up was
what was alleged to have been a judicial sale of the mortgaged property under executory process at the suit of
William R. Gordon, one of the defendants; and the question of importance presented by the record was whether that
sale, as against these complainants, extinguished the lien of
the mortgage.
A minor point, one less relied on, related to the effect of
a certain "judgment of homologation "-as it is called in

JACKSON V. LUDELING.

Particular statement of the case in the opinion of the court.

Louisiana---" in a suit of monition," instituted by the defendants under a statute of Louisiana, passed March 10th,
1834, and by which judgment the defendants contended that
the validity of the sale which the present bill sought to have
declared null, was conclusively established and the bill itself
barred.
The court below declared that no fraud had been practiced, and that the sale must stand. It accordingly dismissed
the bill.
Messrs. E A.
ASpofford and . A. Campbell, for the appellants; Mr. W. E. Runt, contra.
Mr. Justice STRONG delivered the opinion of the court,
stating the facts of the case as they were assumed by the
court on the evidence to be, and stating also the statute of
Louisiana above referred to.
The sale under consideration was made under an ex parte
order, obtained from a judge in chambers on the 23d of December, 1865, at the suit of Gordon, who described himself
as the owner of four of the mortgage bonds, upon which
coupons amounting to $720 were due and unpaid. The
petition for the order of sale did not aver that Gordon was
the owner or bearer of the mortgage, or that he had any
rights therein superior to the rights of any other bondholder for whom the mortgage was a security. It might,
perhaps, be doubted, therefore, whether under the law of
Louisiana he was in a condition to petition for executory
process for a sale of the mortgaged premises, and whether
the judge had any authority on his petition to order a sale.
No question of this kind, however, is seriously made here,
and we proceed to notice at once the manner in which the
process was used, the proceedings prior to the sale and at
the sale, and the actions and relations of the purchasers.
Gordon's petition made no disclosure of the name of any
other holder of bonds secured by the mortgage. Ostensibly
he sued for himself alone. He asked for no notice, and
none was given, of his application to any other bondholder,

though there were seven hundred and sixty-one bonds outtanding, held principally in other States. The order of
seizure was granted by the judge on the 23d day of December, 1865, but it was not filed in the clerk's office until Saturday, the 30th of that month, late in the afternoon, and on
that day the sheriff made a seizure and served a notice
thereof upon H. M. Bry, who was then acting as the president of the corporation, and who subsequently became one
of the purchasers at the sale. On the 2d of January, 1866,
the sheriff advertised the property for sale in one newspaper
published in the town of Monroe, and by posting a copy of
the advertisement on the church door and another at the
door of his office. The sale was appointed for the first
Saturday of February, which was the earliest day on which
it could be made under the law of the State. By that law
the property seized was required to be appraised, and could
not be sold for less than two-thirds of its appraised value.
It consisted of a railroad about one hundred and ninety
miles in length, with numerous water stations, buildings,
warehouses, depots, and depot grounds, cars, locomotive
engines, wagons, machinery, utensils, bills receivable from
numerous promisors, aggregating more than $40,000, unpaid stock subscriptions exceeding $320,000, and a large
land grant of several hundred thousand acres, together with
the franchise of the company. To appraise all this property the appraisers were summoned to meet on February
3d, the day of the sale, at 10 o'clock A.m. They were appointed by Gordon and Bry, both of whom were purchasers
at the sale. Obviously it was impossible for the persons
appointed to make any fair appraisement at that time. Yet
they reported one of all the property at $75,000 in legaltender notes, and the sale proceeded. From the sheriff's
return as first made, drawn up by John T. Ludeling, Gordon's attorney, and one of the purchasers, the sheriff exacted
an illegal and onerous condition. The condition was, that
the purchaser should pay cash to pay the interest coupons
then due, with credit to meet the immature interest and
bonds, and should give bonds, with personal security, for

the credit portion of the bid. At the first cry the property
was struck off to George M. Branner & Co. for $550,000;
but because they failed to pay at once the interest coupons
then due and presented, the sheriff immediately get up the
property again in bulk, and sold and adjudicated it to John
T. Ludeling, John Ray, Francis P. Stubbs, Wesley J. Q.
Baker, William R. Gordon, Henry M. Bry, Joseph F.
McGuire, John A. McGuire, Robert Ray, Joseph P. Crossley, Charles W. Phillips, Robert C. Strother, Christopher H.
Dabbs, George C. Waddell, William M. Pincaird, and James
'U. Horne, the said John T. Ludeling, having bid in the
property for them for the sum of $50,000, and they having
complied with the terms of sale by paying the proportional
amounts of the several coupons due, which were presented
for payment, to wit, $10,739.83, to William R. Gordon, John
T. Ludeling, and James U. Horne, the holders of one hundred and fifty-four bonds, and to F. P. Stubbs $850.68, being
the amount due on the coupons he presented for payment.
Such was the sheriff's return. Two days afterwards he
made a deed to the purchasers.
Were there nothing more in this case than is narrated by
the brief history thus given, which is uncontradicted, it
would be difficult to characterize the transactions as anything less than a great wrong perpetrated by the agency of
legal forms. The great body of the bondholders could have
known nothing of the proceeding to sell the mortgaged
property and discharge their lien. Their residence was remote, and the sale was hurried as' fast as the forms of law
permitted. Not a day was lost. They were not afforded
an opportunity to attend and bid at the sale, or pay off Gordon's small claim of $720. Neither they nor their trustee
were consulted. The sale was made in a village far in the
interior. It was advertised in only one local newspaper,
and not a day longer than the law required. The appraisement was made at the last moment, and it was obviously
intended to facilitate a hasty sale for a nominal price. Onerous and illegal conditions of sale were exacted from other

622

Opinion of the court.

bidders, but not from these purchasers, who paid nothing
except to themselves. A property upon which had been expended nearly $2,000,000, together with a large stock subscription, a large grant of lands, and considerable movable
property, was bought for $50,000 by the very persons who
defeated a sale for a much larger price, and the purchasemoney was retained by themselves.
But to a thorough understanding of the case it is necessary to consider the relation in which many of the purchasers
at the sale, who are the present defendants, stood to the
complainants, and how far their conduct was consistent with
that relation. As we have seen, William R. Gordon, at
whose suit the executory process for the sale was ordered,
was the holder of four bonds. These he obtained in the
month of October, immediately preceding the sale, paying
for them $640, and by his purchase he became entitled to
the security of the mortgage ratably with the holders of the
other bonds. In equity he was a quasi owner in common
with the other bondholders of whatever rights the mortgage
gave. He was not a partner with them, nor strictly a tenant
in common, but the relation into which he introduced himself by his purchase imposed upon him some duties. If he
actually held the mortgage he held it as a trustee. Whether
he did or not, it was a duty which he owed to the other
bondholders not to destroy its value. When two or more
persons have a common interest in a security, equity will not
allow one to appropriate it exclusively to himself, or to impair its worth to the others. Community of interest involves mutual obligation. Admitting, then, that Gordon
had a right to make use of the mortgage to enforce the
payment of the bonds which he held, he had no right so to
use it as to obtain an advantage for himself over the other
bondholders. He had no right to employ it as an instrument by which he might become the owner of the property
mortgaged at the lowest possible price at which it could be
obtained, leaving the bonds held by his associate holders
unpaid. His duty, if he used it at all, was to make it produc-

tive of the most that could be obtained for all who were interested in it, and if he sought to make a profit out of it at
the expense of those whose rights in it were the same as his
own, he was unfaithful to the relation he assumed, and was
guilty of fraud. In Gue v. The Tidewater Canal Company,*
it was said by Chief Justice Taney, when delivering the
opinion of the court, that "it would be against the principles of equity to allow a single creditor to destroy a fund to
which other creditors had a right to look for payment, and
equally against the principles of equity to permit him to destroy the value of the property of the stockholders by dissevering from the franchise property which is essential to
its useful existence."
If, now, the conduct of Gordon be observed and compared
with the relation he sustained to the other mortgage bondholders it will be apparent he was utterly regardless of his
duty. Before he sued out the executory process he conceived the scheme of forcing a sale of the mortgaged premises, not for the purpose of paying the debt which was a lien
upon them, but for profit that might be niade out of the
purchase, or, as he represented in substance to one whom
he requested to join in his plans, because there "was a
probability of a very decided speculation from the sale."
And in pursuance of this scheme, on the 10th day of January, 1866, only a few days after the executory process was
placed in the sheriff's hands, he entered into a written
agreement with John T. Ludeling, W. J. Q. Baker, F. P.
Stubbs, G. 0. Waddell, and John Ray, which had for its
object the purchase of the railroad and mortgaged property
for the exclusive benefit of the parties to the agreement,
with no reference to the other bondholders. By this agreement he placed himself in an antagonistic position to those
creditors of the company whose security he was using.
Their interest was that the property should bring a full
price, but his, under the agreement, was that it should be
sold for the lowest price possible. Nor is this all. Ile him.

self appointed one of the two appraisers who, on the day of
the sale, made an appraisement so obviously inadequate and
unfair that it forces a conviction it was made collusively to
enable the parties to the agreement to obtain the property
at a price nearly nominal. The entire property was appraised at seventy-five thousand dollars. Five hundred and
fifty thousand dollars were bid for it (though the bid was
rejected), and immediately after it was adjudicated to Gordon and his associates, they were offered for their bid one
million of dollars, as testified by the person who made the
offer, or six hundred thousand dollars, as admitted by Ludeling, and the offer was rejected. Gordon was also a party
to the steps taken by which the sheriff was induced to reject
the bid of five hundred and fifty thousand dollars made by
Branner & Co., and put the property up for a resale. It is
impossible to look at all this without coming to the conclusion that Gordon's conduct was, from beginning to end, a
violation of the duty he owed to the other bondholders, a
duty growing out of his relation to them, and out of his appropriation of a security in which they had an interest nearly
two hundred times greater than his own.
And the situation of the other defendants is little if any
better. John Ray, Joseph F. McGuire, John C. McGuire,
Christopher H. Dabbs, Wesley J. Q. Baker, Robert Ray,
and Henry M. Bry were directors of the railroad company
when the executory process was sued out, and when the
sale was made. Bry was the vice-president and acting president, in consequence of the absence of the president, who
was in Georgia. Joseph McGuire was the company's secretary and treasurer. All these parties were at hand, residents
in or near Monroe. As officers of the company they had the
custody and charge of the railroad and all the property of
the corporation. And they held it in a very legitimate sense
as trustees. Certainly they were the trustees of the stockholders, and also, to a considerable degree, of the bondholders, owners of the mortgage. We do not say they might
not have purchased the property at a sale over which they
had no control, and made under judicial process adverse to

the company. Perhaps they might. But we do say they
had no right to join hands with Gordon. They bad no right
to enter into or participate in a combination, the object of
which was to divest the company of its property and obtain
it for themselves at a sacrifice, or at the lowest price possible..
They had no right to seek their own profit at the expense
of the company, its stockholders, or even its bondholders.
Such a course was forbidden by their relation to the conpany. It was their duty, to the extent of their power, to,
secure for all those whose interests were in their charge thehighest possible price for the property which could be obtained for it at the sheriff's sale. They could not rightfully
place themselves in a position in which their interests became adverse to those of either the stockholders or bondholders. And this rule was peculiarly applicable to these
defendants. On the 11th of October, 1865, only about twoand a half months before Gordon instituted his proceedings.
to effect a sale of the road, the directors had resolved that,,
"in pursuance of resolutions passed by a meeting of the,
stoQkholders held on October 2d, the president of the company be appointed to make arrangements with any company
who, in his judgment, might be able to put the road in repair, which was theretofore in operation, and complete thebalance of the road, ' and pay the debts of the company;' and,.
if such arrangements could be made, that the same be reported to the directors, and upon their approval, that such
steps should be taken as might vest the road, its franchises,.
and other property in such company." One of the purposes.
of this resolution was the payment of the debts of the company. How, then, can it be claimed that directors who had
thus resolved, in obedience to the instructions of the stockholders, were at liberty to participate in a scheme, the object and effect of which was to divest the company of all its
property and franchises without the payment of its debts?
How can they be permitted to join hands with those who
sought to obtain that property at the lowest price, whose
interest it was to have no other bidders than themselves at
the sale, and whose action tended to defeat the avowed obVOL. XXI.

ject of the resolution passed by the directors, as well as to
make worthless the security which it was their duty to protect and render in the highest possible degree fruitful?
Having thus noticed the relation in which these defendants stood towards the company, its shareholders, and its
bondholders, and some of the duties and disabilities attendant upon that relation, we are prepared to inquire how those
duties were performed. It is proved that a combination was
formed as early as Iovember 18th, 1865, by some of these
directors to become the purchasers of the property and franchises of the company exclusively for their benefit and the
benefit of those whom they might consent to associate with
them. A written agreement to that effect was made and
signed by John Ray, William S. Parham, and W. J.Q.
Baker, both Ray and Baker being then directors. By the
agreement John T. Ludeling was appointed the agent of the
parties to make the purchase in their name. This was very
shortly after the resolution of the board of directors, to which
we have called attention, was adopted. The agreement was
repugnant to that resolution, which contemplated no disposition of the property which did not provide for the payment
of the debts of the company, none that might be for the exclusive advantage of some directors. The agreement was
made after Wadley, the president, had left the State and
.gone to Georgia, where most of the bondholders resided,
with a view, if possible, to effect such an arrangement as the
resolution of October 11th recommended. There is no direct evidence that at this time these parties were in combination with Gordon to obtain the property for themselves by
a hurried sale, conducted with the least possible opportunity
for notice of his proceeding to those stockholders and bondholders resident at a distance, who had the greatest interest.
But that such a confederacy subsequently existed we think
ought to be inferred from what subsequently occurred. Indeed, many facts point to such a combination and can be
accounted for only by it.
On the 10th of January, 1866, Ludeling, Baker, and John

Oct. 1874.]

JAcKSoN v.

LUDELING.

Further statement of the case in the opinion.

Ray entered into another agreement with Gordon, Stubbs,
and Waddell, by which, after reciting that proceedings had
been instituted to sell the railroad, with the property
thereto attached and appertaining, they agreed severally to
deposit with Ludeling a sum of money to be used for the
purpose of forwarding the interests of the company (i e., the
associated parties) relatively to the railroad and property
bought, and that the parties to the agreement should be interested in the stock, shares, and property of the company
in the proportion of the amount of money put in by each
one, regardless of what the property might have cost. Ludeling was designated to bid for the property, and, should he
buy, was required to take the title in the names of the contracting parties and such others as might be necessary to
preserve the existence of the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and
Texas Railroad Company. No one was permitted to sell
out his interest within six months after the purchase without
the consent of a majority of the other joint owners or copartners, and after that time, namely, the expiration of the
six months, the refusal was given to the company. This
agreement was also signed about February 1st, 1866, by
Robert Ray, another director, as he has testified. Thus
these directors became avowedly confederates with Gordon
to purchase the property and to purchase it for their own
benefit. Thus they took a position in which it became their
interest that the property should be sold at a low price; that
there should be as little competition as possible, and that no
efforts should be made to stay the sale, or give any more
notice than a formal compliance with the law required.
Thus their interests were brought into direct antagonism
with the interests of the stockholders and bondholders.
Thus they combined to defeat the accomplishment of the
arrangement proposed by the resolution of the directors of
October 11th, 1865. It is impossible to regard this combination as anything less than a plain violation of their duty,
a breach of the trust reposed in them, and, if not an actual,
at least a constructive, fraud.
The plan proposed by this arrangement, however, was dis-

turbed unexpectedly by the arrival in Monroe of James I.
Horne, another director of the company. He appeared in
the latter part of January, 1866, shortly before the day of
sale, commissioned by the holders of a large number of the
mortgage bonds (nearly three hundred) to have the railroad
sold and purchased by a trustee or trustees, to be selected
by the bondholders and creditors of the company, in which
class the preferred shareholders might be placed; a new
company to be formed of the purchasers upon a basis to be
previously agreed upon and signed by the several interests,
the bondholders to be placed in the class of preferred shareholders, and the other creditors and preferred shareholders
to have common stock. This plan proposed the extinction
of common stock and the creation of a new mortgage for
the purpose of repairing and stocking the road. Horne's
commission was in writing. On his way to Monroe he met
Gordon in New Orleans, and there learned for the first time
that proceedings had been instituted to bring the property
to sale. Gordon then proposed to him to unite his interests
and those of his constituents with those of the party in
Monroe, namely, the party that had combined to purchase
the property. Upon Horne's arrival at Monroe he had several interviews with Ludeling, and it appears that he endeavored to procure a postponement of the sale, representing
that Gordon had consented to such postponement. To this
Ludeling replied that Gordon had no authority to make
such an offer or consent. Considering that Ludeling was
then a party to, and the active agent of, the combination
that had been formed, this reply is most remarkable. It
shows that the confederacy had then the control of the executory process and of the sale, and that the directors of the
company had put themselves in the position of both sellers
and buyers of the property they held in trust; for if Gordon
had no authority to consent to the postponement of the sale,
it must have been because of his arrangements with the directors. But, passing this by, after many propositions,
Horne was persuaded by Ludeling, and without any communication with his constituents, to enter into an agreement,

Opinion of the court.

which was made on the 2d of February, 1866, one day before the sale. The material part of this agreement was that
Gordon, Ludeling, Baker, Stubbs, Waddell, and John Rlay,
of the first part, and Horne, of the second part, for himself
and friends, should club their funds to buy the property of
the Vicksburg, Shreveport, and Texas fRailroad Company,
advertised for sale on the morrow; in partnership, and, if
the property should be bought by them, that the party of
the first part should own two-thirds, and the party of the
second part should own one-third. The agreement reveals
apprehension that the sale might be stopped by injunction,
or declared null and void. It was signed "John T. Lude-'
ling, for himself and friends," and "J. U. Horne, for himself and friends," and it is proved that when it was entered
into Ludeling was informed of Horne's mission and of the
plan he was instructed to carry out.
It is impossible to characterize this agreement as anything
else than fraudulent. Its obvious purpose was to remove
competition at the sale. It was a flagrant breach of trust
on the part of Horne, and it was a fraud in Ludeling, with
knowledge of the trust Horne had undertaken, to persuade
him to violate his instructions and sacrifice the interests of
his constituents, himself becoming a party to the violation.
Such were the combinations organized, and such was the
object of the combinations, when the day qrrived on which
the sale had been advertised to be made. This large property was about to be sold for a claim of $720, at a village
remote from the residence of the great body of those most
interested in it. It must have been known that notice of
the sale in all probability had not reached those parties.
Their agent, sent to protect their interest, had been tampered with and overcome. INot one of the defendants, who
were residents at Monroe and directors of the company,
who had combined to become purchasers at the sale, and
not one of those who subsequently united in the purchase
and became directors of the new company, not even Bry
himself, the vice-president, had lifted a finger to stay the

sale, or, so far as appears, bad requested any delay, or had
made any effort to prevent the probable sacrifice of the property; and when Mr. Garrett, a lawyer and resident stockholder at Monroe, obtained an injunction against the sale,
he was bought off by the payment of $2500 for common
stock, confessedly not worth a cent, yet taken at its par
value, and he was required to stipulate that he would take
no fee from, or in any manner counsel or advise, either directly or indirectly, any person who might desire to attack
the sale. This arrangement was negotiated by Baker, and
the money was paid by Ludeling. We have already noticed
the appraisement made after ten o'clock on the morning of
the sale by two persons appointed by Gordon and Bry. Of
its character we propose to say little more. Manifestly it
had been prepared before the appraisers were selected. It
was conveniently low to enable the associates to purchase
for a sum almost nominal, and one of the appraisers at least
was appointed by a person who had combined with others
to become a purchaser, and who was, consequently disqualified from selecting an appraiser, or, certainly, was unfit to
make such a selection.
Everything having been thus prepared the sale proceeded,
but the scheme of the associates was at first deranged by
the interference of other bidders, Branner & Co., who bid
for the property $550,000, more than seven times the amount
of the appraisement, and to whom it was first struck off.
Then ensued what we must regard as a most remarkable
effort to prevent an adjudication to these bidders and an
acceptance by the sheriff of their bid. Ludeling, for himself and his associates, and acting as their chief agent, presented one hundred and fifty-four of the mortgage bonds,
four of which were Gordon's, one Bry's, and most, if not
all, the remainder obtained from Horne, and demanded immediate payment of the past-due coupons. He had no right
to make such a demand. He knew the bonds had been
placed in Horne's hands for other purposes. He knew that
it was a breach of faith in Horne to allow them to be thus
usedl, and a fraud upon their owners thus to use them.

JACKSON v. LUDELING.
Opinion of the court.

Stubbs presented seventy-two coupons taken from other
bonds, and also demanded immediate payment. And he
had no authority to make such a use of those coupons.
They had been placed in his hands for another purpose,
which failed, and their owners had directed them to be returned. Bry also had one bond, and he presented it with
its coupons. This one bond, with the four of Gordon, were
all that there was any authority to present. Yet the confederates, taking advantage of Horne's breach of trust, and
of Stubbs's unauthorized act, were enabled to present the
coupons of one hundred and fifty-four bonds, and part of the
coupons of thirty-six other bonds, for immediate payment.
The sheriff joined in the demand, and, because Branner &
Co. were unable at once to pay this unauthorized claim, he
set up the property again immediately for sale, when it was
struck off, on Ludeling's bid of $50,000, to the persons we
have named. This was on Saturday, late in the afternoon,
and on the Monday next following the sheriff's deed was
delivered, but the bidders, though receipting in part to each
other, have still in their hands the whole of their bid except
$468.75, the amount of costs paid to the sheriff.
Thus directors of the company, owing duties to its stockholders and creditors, not only combined to obtain the company's property for themselves at a sacrifice, through the
formality of a judicial sale, .butwere active participants in
successful efforts to defeat a sale for $550,000 in order that
they might become the purchasers for $50,000.
It is impossible to sustain such a transaction. Throughout it was grossly inequitable. That the property was sacrificed by means of an unlawful and widespread combination
is abundantly proved, and that the directors who were parties to it, and who became the purchasers, were guilty of an
inexcusable violation of confidence reposed in them admits
of no doubt. Ludeling, it is true, was not a director, but he
was a leading member of the combination aud its chief agent
to carry out its plans, He knew its purposes. He knew its
illegality. H9 had negotiated the surrender of Horne, with
full knowledge of Horne's breach of trust. He assumed the

control of Gordon's executory process, and, as we have noticed, when told that Gordon had consented to stay the sale,
he declared that Gordon had no power to do it. Indeed,
Ludeling appears to have had complete possession of the
sheriff. He drew up the sheriff's return, carefully stating
in it that all the requirements and formalities of the law had
been complied with in the second offering as they had been
in the first, and he was, as the evidence shows, most active
in defeating an adjudication to Branner & Co. on their large
bid.
The connection of Stubbs and Waddell with the combination we have already sufficiently shown, and it is not claimed
that the other defendants, Crossley and Phillips, are anything
more than volunteers. They have paid nothing. The sheriff
adjudicated the property to them, and his deed was made to
them, in common with others, but it is proved that their interest is only nominal, each having had one share given to
him. They were introduced to enable the confederates to
carry out their scheme. Pincaird, according to his own
statement, was a' party to the agreement of February 2d,
1866, between Ludeling and his friends, and Horne and his
friends. He was therefore one of the parties to the unlawful combination.
The defendants can take nothing from such a sale, thus
made. Were we to sustain it, we should sanction a great
moral and legal wrong, give encouragement to faithlessness
to trusts, and confidence reposed, and countenance combinations to wrest by the forms of law from the uninformed and
confiding their just rights.
No words need be expended to show that the defence of
the new company, the North Louisiana and Texas Railroad
Company, must fall with that of the other defendants. The
new company was formed by the purchasers at this illegal
and void sale. It was organized while this suit was pending,
and it has no other title than that of these purchasers.
It remains only to consider the effect of the judgment in
the monition suit instituted by these defendants on the 21st

Opinion of the court.-Judgment of homologation.

day of April, 1866. They contend that the judgment of
homologation rendered in that suit conclusively establishes
the validity of the sale made to them, and bars the present
bill. But we think such is not the effect of the judgment.
The proceeding to homologate a sheriffs sale is peculiar to
Louisiana. It is authorized by an act of the legislature
passed March 10th, 1834.* That act authorizes purchasers
at a sheriff's sale to apply for a monition to all persons interested who can set up any right, title, or claim to the property described in consequence of any informality in the order
or decree, or judgment of the court under which the sale
was made, or any irregularity or illegality in the appointment
and advertisement in time or manner of sale, or for any other
defect whatsoever, to show cause why the sale should not
be confirmed and homologated. If no cause be shown, the
judgment of confirmation in the case is conclusive upon the
world. But conclusive of what? Conclusive that there have
been no fatal informalities, or irregularities, or defects; we
think of nothing more. The act has relation to mistakes or
omissions of the officers of the law. But there is nothing in
it which authorizes an inquiry into or an adjudication upon
questions of fraud; nothing which concludes the question
whether the purchasers have obtained their title by fraud,
or whether they are trustees maldfide for others. And'such
has been the ruling of the Louisiana courts. In The City
Bank v. Walden,t the court considered the effect and scope
of the act. "It was passed," they said, "for the protection
of bond fide purchasers at judicial sales from litigation concerning matters of form, a non-observance of which frequently exposed purehasers to unreasonable and vexatious
suits. The difficulty of administering and preserving proofs
of the observance of formalities was, in the hand8 of the unscrupulous, the instrument of great annoyance and expense
to thoe who had purchased and paid for property exposed
to sale under the authority of our courts. We do not under* Revised Statutes, title Monition, sections 2374 to 2380.

stand the operation of the act to extend beyond the matters of form, nor that it purports to operate upon matters
'dehors' the record." This is manifestly the true construction of the statute, and it is quite consistent with the enactment that the judgment of homologation is to be received
and considered as "full and conclusive proof that the sale was
duly made according to law, in virtue of a judgment or order
legally and regularly pronounced on the interests of the parties duly represented." Fraud and trust are entirely outside
the record. A sale may have been conducted legally in all
its process and forms, and yet the purchaser may have been
guilty of fraud, or may hold the property as a trustee. In
this case the complainants rely upon no irregularity of proceeding, upon no absence of form. The forms of law were
scrupulously observed. But they rely upon faithlessness to
trusts and common obligations, upon combinations against
the policy of the law and fraudulent, and upon confederate
and successful efforts to deprive them wrongfully of property
in which they had a large interest, for the benefit of persons
in whom they had a right to place confidence. Homologation is no obstacle to such a claim.
JUDGMENT REVERSED.

are authorized to prove their bonds under the decree of this
court or of the Circuit Court.

as may appear best calculated to promote the interests of all.
5. And it is further ordered and decreed that the defendants
do account for all money and property received by them out of
the property so sold to them or any of them, or from its profits
or income, receiving in their account such credits as, under the
circumstances of the case, by the law of Louisiana, they are entitled to, and that they pay and deliver to the receiver whatever on such accounting may be found due from them.
And it is ordered and adjudged that the defendants do pay
the costs in this court and in the Circuit Court.
