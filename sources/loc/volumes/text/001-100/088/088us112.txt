NICHOLS.

[Sup. Ct.

Statement of the case.

SMITH V. NICHOLS.
'1. Under the seventh and ninth sections of the Patent Act of 1837, which
authorize a patentee, when by mistake, &c., he may have made his specification too broad, to make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he does not claim under it, and to record his disclaimer in the
Patent Office, &c., with various provisos as to its effect on suits pending,
and as to unreasonable neglect and delay in entering the disclaimer at
the Patent Office, the patentee may file a disclaimer as well after as before the commencement of a suit. It would, however, in case of its
being filed after, be the duty of the court to see that the defendant was
not injuriously taken by surprise, and to impose such terms as right and
justice might require. The question of unreasonable delay would be
open for the consideration of the court, and the complainant could recover no costs.
2. A mere carrying forward of an original conception patented-a new and
more extended application of it-involving change only of form, proportions, or degree-the substitution of equivalents doing the same thing
as did the original invention by substantially the same means with better
effects-is not such invention as will sustain a patent. It is the invention of what is new, and not the arrival at comparative superiority or
greater excellence in that which was already known, which the law prGtects as exclusive property and which it secures by patent.
3. Hence, where a textile fabric, having a certain substantial construction
and possessing essential properties, has been long known and in use, a
patent is void when all that distinguishes a new fabric is higher finish,
greater beauty of surface, the result perhaps of greater tightness of
weaving, and due to the observation or skill of the workman, or to the
perfection of the machinery employed.
APPEAL

from the Circuit Court for the District of Massa..

chusetts.
Smith, a holder of a patent from the United States, filed
a bill, on the 19th of November, 1868, against Nichols, in
the court below, to enforce and protect his rights as patentee.
The subject-matter of the patent was an elastic woven fabric,
especially adapted to use in forming gores for what are
known as Congress or gaiter-boots, though applicable to
other uses.
On the 22d of January, 1870, he filed a disclaimer of right
to certain matters included in his patent, and on the 27th
of May, 1872, of certain other matters so included, both

being alleged to have been included through inadvertence
and mistake. These disclaimers were made in virtue of
the seventh and ninth sections of the Patent Act of 1837;
sections which read thus:
"SECTIoN 7. Whenever any patentee shall have through inadvertence, &c., made his specification of claim too broad, claiming more than that of which he was the original or first inventor,
some material and substantial part of the thing patented being
truly ...his own, any such patentee... may make disclaimer
of such parts of the thing patented as the disclaimant shall not
claim to hold by virtue of the patent, &c., which disclaimer shall
be in writing, &c., and recorded in the Patent Office.... But no
such disclaimer shall affect any action pending at the time of its
being filed except so far as may relate to the question of unreasonable neglect or delay in filing the same.
"SEcTIoN 9. Whenever by mistake, &c., any patentee shall
have, in his specification, claimed to be the original and first inventor or discoverer of any material or substantial part of the
thingpatented, of which he was not the first and original inventor
or discoverer,... in every such case the patent shall be deemed
good and valid for so much of the invention or discovery as shall
be truly and bondfide his own .... And every such patentee, &c.,
shall be entitled to maintain a suit at law or in equity on such
patent for any infringement of such part of the invention or
discovery as shall be bond fide his own.... But in every such
case in which a judgment or verdict shall be rendered. for the
plaintiff he shall not be entitled to recover costs against the defendant unless he shall have entered at the Patent Office, prior
to the commencement of the suit, a disclaimer of all that part of
the thing patented which was so claimed without right, Provided, however, that no person bringing any such suit shall be
entitled to the provisions contained in this section, who shall
have unreasonably neglected or delayed to enter at the Patent Office
a disclaimer as aforesaid."
The defendants, relying on Wyeth v. Slone,* a case decided
by Story, J., set up that in consequence of these disclaimers
being filed after the suit was brought, the suit could not be

entertained under the said seventh section, inasmuch as the
concluding part of that section prevented the disclaimer
from affecting any action "pending at the time of its being
filed;" and the suit thus stood as one of a patentee with a
patent for things which he confessed were already known;
a void patent, therefore. And, in addition, that as to the
second disclaimer-that filed on the 27th of May, 1872, and,
therefore, more than four years after the bill was filedthe second proviso of the ninth section about unreasonable
neglect and delay in entering it at the Patent Office applied.
But the court did not consider this a sufficient reason for
sending the complainant out of court and compelling him
to file a new bill; and it therefore heard the case on its
merits.
Proceeding then with a general statement as to these.
The fabric patented, as limited by the two disclaimers,
was asserted in the bill to be a new manufacture, and that
its distinguishing merit consisted in the fact that while it
was extremely elastic it might be shaped or cut either crosswise or bias without detriment to its elastic properties; the
rubber cords, which gave to it those properties, being so
held by the weft threads of the fabric that they could not
"creep" or slip so as to withdraw themselves from their
proper position, by any force of tension that might be
needed in adapting them to their intended use.
It appeared, indeed, that owing to the excellent manner
of weaving, and perhaps from other causes, the fabric had
gone into extensive use, and for the especial purpose of
elastic gores in gaiter-boots was in fact the only fabric now
largely used. The evidence, however, showed that a fabric
substantially the same in construction and possessing virtually the same properties, had been known and used in this
country previous to the fabric produced and patented by
Smith, and that the superiority of the fabric patented was
due solely either to improved machinery or to the greater
mechanical skill employed in the formation of the fabric, by

which an excellence in degree was obtained, but not one in
kind.
The court accordingly dismissed the bill. And the complainant took this appeal.

Mr. Charles Mason, for the appellant; Messrs. George Gifford and Benjamin Dean, contra.
Mr. Justice SWAYNE stated the case more particularly,
and delivered the opinion of the court.
The bill is founded upon a patent, and was filed by the
appellant. It charges infringement. Its object and prayer
are to have the defendant enjoined from infringing further,
and required to account for the profits he has wrongfully
made.
The original patent was issued to the complainant on the
5th of April, 1853. On the 28th of March, 1867, it was extended for seven years. It was subsequently reissued in
three divisions, as follows: Reissue No. 2656, June 18tb,
1867, division A, for improvements in weaving; reissue No.
3014, June 20th, 1868, division B, for improvements in woven
fabrics9 and reissue No. 2844, January 14th, 1868, division
0, for improvements in looms for weaving. Division B is
the only one to be considered in this case.
' In the specification the loom and process for weaving
corded elastic india-rubber fabrics are described, and the
excellence of such fabrics so woven, and the points in which
they are superior to fabrics not so woven, are pointed out
and insisted upon. The claim is thus expressed:
"What, therefore, I claim as my invention in this subdivison
of my patent is-"The corded fabric, substantially as hereinbefore described,
in which the cords are elastic and held between the upper and
under weft threads, and separated from each other by the interweaving of the upper and under weft threads with the warp
threads in the spaces between the cords, and only there, sub.
stantially as above shown."
This bill was filed on the 19th of November, 1868.

v.

NTIcHOLS.

[Sup. GL.

Particular statement of the case in the opinion.

On the 22d of January, 1870, the complainant filed a disclaimer of any fabric in which the warp and weft threads
are so interwoven between the elastic cords as to form strips
of shirred cloth between and by the contraction of the elastic
cords-the warp threads in hisaimproved fabric being, as he
declared, only interwoven with the weft threads-for the
purpose of binding them tightly around the elastic cords.
On the 27th of May, 1872, he filed a disclaimer of "any
fabric in which the weft threads are so interwoven with the
warp threads that the former are not brought halfway around
each of said cords, so as to gripe them in such a way as not
to permit said elastic cords to slip between said weft threads,
in case said cords are cut crosswise or bias."
The substance of the specification as limited by the disclaimers may be thus summarized: The elastic cords are
placed side by side, equidistant from each other. They are
stretched several times their normal length. In the spaces
between the cords warp threads are placed parallel with the
cords, and of less size. The cords remain stationary. The
warp threads are thrown open by the machinery of the loom.
Every alternate thread is thrown upwards and the intermediate one downwards. What is termed a "shed 'bis thus
formed above the cords and one under them. Through
each of these sheds a weft thread is passed by means of a
shuttle. One of the shuttles is thus passed above and the
other below all the rubber cords. After both the weft
threads have been driven home by the lathe, the position
of the warp threads is inverted by the treadle. Sheds are
thus formed on the opposite sides of the cords. Weft threads
are then again passed across the fabric. This process is
continued until the weaving is completed.
The weft threads form the only covering on the upper and
under side of the cords. When their tension ceases after
the weaving is done the cords contract in length and increase proportionately in thickness. The weft threads are
necessarily brought into proximity with each other. They
partially imbed themselves in the cords, hold them firmly,
and prevent them from slipping back, if cut anywkere, while

at the tension which subsisted when the weaving took place.
So the weft threads cling tightly to the rubber cords in every
degree of tension to which they may be subjected. Each
of the former grasps firmly each of the latter half round.
The points with respect to this litigation, which the complainant claims as covered by his patent, we understand, are
that fewer warp threads are used, that the tightness of the
weaving is greater, that the rubber cords in all stages of
tension are more firmly and effectually held in his fabric
than in any which preceded it,-and especially, the manner
in which the weft threads, one above and the other below,grasp each of the rubber cords half round.
It is objected that the disclaimers having been made after
the filing of the complainant's bill, cannot avail him in this
case. Upon a fair construction of the seventh and ninth
sections of the act of 1837, we think they could be made as
well after as before the commencement of the suit. It would,
in such case, be the duty of the court to see that the defendant was not injuriously surprised, and to impose-such terms
as right and justice might require. The question of unreasonable delay would be open for the consideration of the
court, and the complainant could recover no costs. We see
no reason for turning a party out of court to renew the litigation after filing the disclaimer, thus subjecting both parties
to the delay and expense which must necessarily follow, and
without any benefit to either. We cannot believe such to
have been the intention of Oongress.*
The defence mainly relied upon is want of novelty; in
other words, the prior public use of the things patented.
The counsel for the appellant admits expressly that an
elastic fabric with silk on one side and cotton on the other,
one woven with two shuttles, one woven with stationary
elastic cords, and one with elastic cords covered above and
below solely by weft threads, were known and in public use
by themselves separately before the alleged invention of the

complainant. It is also admitted that suspender webbing
of difibrent kinds, some provided with elastic cords having
strips of cloth interwoven between them, and another class
without the strips of cloth and similar to the complainant's,
"except that the weft threads in pairs were not made to
grasp the elastic cords in the manner described in the complainant's specification," also in like manner preceded his
invention. The proof to the same effect, less the exception
named, is voluminous and conclusive. It is unnecessary
particularly to refer to it. The testimony is equally full as
to webbing for shoe gores. That, made in the same way as
the suspender webbing, also came into public use and was
largely sold at as early a period.
The testimony of Iotchkiss establishes conclusively thatalso prior to the defendant's invention-he made and sold
suspender webbing with what were called binding warps
between the rubber warps, with weft threads which "1went
over all the rubber warps, and under all the rubber warps,"
and that the fabric was woven while the rubber cords were
in a state of tension. He says further, that lie had never
known suspender webbing made by American manufacturers in any other way. There is a large mass of other testimony relative to the case in this aspect, but it is deemed
unnecessary to pursue the subject further.
The evidence before us leaves to the complainant none of
the particulars claimed as of his invention, except perhaps
greater tightness of the weaving, a firmer grasping of the
elastic cords by the weft threads half round, above and below, and greater beauty and value of the fabric. The entire
ground of the controversy between the parties is reduced to
this narrow isthmus, and the question presented for our determination is one rather of law than of fact.
A patentable invention is a mental result. It must be
new and shown to be of practical utility. Everything within
the domain of the conception belongs to him who conceived
it. The machine, process, or product is but its material reflex and embodiment. A new idea may be ingrafted upon
an old invention, be distinct from the conception which
