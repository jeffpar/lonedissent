authorities on the subject and gave the conclusion we have
stated.
In the present case it is not pretended that the defendants,
when they took the bonds in controversy, had notice of any
circumstances outside of the instruments themselves, and
the absence of the certificates referred to in them, to throw
doubt upon the title of the holder.
We see no error in the rulings of the court below, and its
judgment is, therefore,
AFFIRMED.

CLARK, ASSIGNEE, V. ISELIN.
1. When a person, borrowing money of another, pledges with that other a
large number of bills receivable as collateral security for the loan
(many of them overdue) the pledgee may properly hand them back to
the debtor pledging them, for the purpose of being collected, or to be
replaced by others. All money so collected is money collected by the
debtor in a fiduciary capacity for the pledgee. And if a portion of the
collaterals are subsequently replaced by others, the debtor's estate being
left unimpaired, and the transaction be conducted without any purpose
to delay or defraud the pledgor's creditors, or to give a preference to
any one, the fact that proceedings in bankruptcy were instituted in a
month afterwards and the pledgor was declared a bankrupt, will not
avoid the transaction.
2. The giving, by a debtor, for a consideration of equal value passing at the
time, of a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, or of that which,
under the code of New York, is the equivalent of such warrant, and
there called a " confession of judgment," is not an act of bankruptcy,
though such warrant or "confession" be not entered of record, but on
the contrary be kept as such things often or ordinarily are, in the creditor's own custody, and with their existence unknown to others. The
creditor may enter judgment of record on them when he pleases (even
upon insolvency apparent), and issue execution and sell. Such his
action is all valid and not in fraud of the Bankrupt law unless he be
assisted by the debtor.
a. A creditor, having by execution obtained a valid lien on his debtor's
stock of goods, of an amount in value greater than the amount of the
execution, may, up to the proceedings in bankruptcy, without violating any provision of the Bankrupt Act, receive from the debtor bills
receivable and accounts due him, and a small sum of cash, to the
amount of the execution; the execution being thereupon released, and
the judgment declared satisfied.

CLARK V. ISELIN.
Statement of the case.

ON appeal and cross-appeal from the Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York.
Clark, assignee in bankruptcy of Dibblee & Co., filed a
bill in the District Court of the district just named against
Iselin & Co., to recover certain assets which the bill charged
were made over to them in fraud of the Bankrupt law; an
act whose thirty-fifth section is in these words:
"If any person, being insolvent, or in contemplation of insolvency, within four months before the filing of the petition by or
against him, with a view to give a preference to any creditor,
or person having a claim against him, or who is under any liability for him, procures any part of his property to be attached,
sequestered, or seized on execution, or makes any payment,
pledge, assignment, transfer, or conveyance of any part of his
property, either directly or indirectly, absolutely or conditionally, the person receiving such payment, pledge or assignment,
transfer or conveyance, or to be benefited thereby, or by such
attachment, having reasonable cause to believe such person is
insolvent, and that such attachment, payment, pledge, assignment, or conveyance is made in fraud of the provisions of this
act, the same shall be void, and the assignee may recover the
property, or the value of it, from the person so receiving or so
to be benefited."

Upon the hearing a decree was made granting the relief
asked for, in part, and in part refusing it; and on appeal
to the Circuit Court this decree of the District Court was
affirmed. Both parties now appealed to this court.
The firm of Dibblee & Co., jobbers, was formed in January, 1866, continued in business till May, 1869, and on the
petition of creditors, filed May 3d, 1869, was adjudged bankrupt June 2d, 1869.
The defendants, Iselin & Co., were bankers, doing business in .the city of New York, and as such had various dealings with the firm of Dibblee & Co., who from time to time
required commercial facilities; advancing to them money on
the pledge of bills receivable, which Dibblee & Co. had reeeived in the course of their business.
On the 6th of August, 1868, they borrowed from the de.

fendants $61,000, for which they gave their four notes, payable one in September, one in October, one in November,
and the other in December of that year, and at the same
time they transferred to the defendants, as collateral security
for the loan, one hundred and forty-seven bills receivable by
them, amounting in the aggregate to $72,170.42. Many of
these bills were past due when they were pledged. On the
day next following the loan the notes held as collateral were
returned to Dibblee & Co. for convenience of collection, to
be collected for account of the defendants, or to be replaced
by others.
Of the four notes discounted by Iselin & Co., on the 6th
of August, 1868, the one which fell due in September was
paid at maturity, and the collaterals pledged for it were surrendered. The other notes were not paid when they fell
due, but were renewed from time to time and extended, and
the collaterals held by them were in part replaced by others.
Thus, on the 4th day of December, 1868, the day when
the bankrupts' last note matured, the amount of the collaterals pledged to the defendants was $63,240.61, and they
were all, or nearly all, good. It did not appear that any of
them were uncollectible. For some of these others were
substituted up to January 15th, 1869, and on the 5th of
April, 1869, the amount of collaterals pledged for the payment of the three notes given by the bankrupts was either
$63,318.89 or $65,013.15. On that day they were all withdrawn, and others, amounting to $62,027.34, were contemporaneously pledged in their stead.
This pledge was sustained by the decrees below, and the
assignee appealed.
On the 8th of April, 1869, Dibblee & Co. paid to Iselin &
Co. $7944.88, being the principal and interest of certain
loans made without security prior to the 30th of November,
1868. The evidence showed that Dibblee & Co. were paying their debts generally, as they matured. This payment
also was sustained by the decree, and the assignee appealed.
There were some other transactions which the assignee
called in question, which were sustained, and from which

the assignee appealed, but which need not be more particularly mentioned.
A transaction, however, which both courts set aside, and
over which there was much more doubt and argument everywhere than about the others which it sustained, was of this
sort.
On the 25th of February, 1869, Dibblee & Co. gave a judgment note, in the form authorized by the New York code,
to secure $54,100 lent by the defendants to them. This sort
of note had what is called "a confession of judgment" on it.
The maker declares that he "confesses judgment in favor of
.A. B." for such a sum, and "authorizes judgment to be entered therefor" against him. It is the equivalent of the old
"warrant of attorney." A portion of the sum of $54,000,
mentioned in this note, had been advanced on the 21st of
February, and a judgment bill then given; another portion
on the 23d of February, for which a similar security was
then given, and the remainder was advanced February 24th.
On the 25th of that month the previous confessions of judgment were given up and destroyed, and one confession for
the entire loan, $54,100, was taken as above mentioned.
The advances for which this confession was taken were
made in negotiable State and railroad bonds, of a larger
nominal value, but they were taken by Dibblee & Co. at
their cash value at the time. They were made to enable
the bankrupts to borrow money, and upon depositing the
securities lent as collateral they obtained $46,000 from three
banks with which they did business.
The confession of judgment was held by the defendants
without entry of record until April 80th, 1869, when judgment was entered upon it in the Supreme Court, as the bill
averred at the request of the defendants, and an execution
was issued and levied upon the debtor's stock of goods, considerably greater in value than the amount of the debt. On the next
day (May 1st), at the request of the debtors, they paid to the
banks with which the bonds lent had been pledged the sums
for which they were held, and took up the collaterals and
notes. Thus a payment was effected on the judgment of

ing to $47,839.52, in satisfaction of the balance of the judgment, and the levy was released.
The Circuit Court decided that the mere giving of the
judgment note was legitimate, but held the subsequent
transaction to be fraudulent, as in conflict with the Bankrupt Act, and decreed that the assignee of the bankrupts
should recover from the defendants the amount received by
them from the securities transferred on the 1st of May, together with the $1900 paid to them in cash, and the value
of the securities redeemed by them from the banks, above
the sums which they paid for the redemption. From this
part of the decree Iselin & Co. appealed, asserting that the
payment, and the transfer of securities made to them by
iDibblee & Co. on the 1st of May, was not a preference in
fraud of the Bankrupt Act, or any preference at all.
We return now to the transactions previous to the one
last mentioned (from which the defendants appealed), and
state the testimony bearing upon them.
The complainant alleged that the notes discounted by
the defendants for the bankrupts in August, 1868, were mere
renewals, and renewals of notes previously unsecured. However, the testimony established that Iselin & Co. were fully
covered with collaterals for these discounts, from the time
that they originated, and that the moneys collected by Dibblee & Co., on the collaterals temporarily intrusted to them,
were, until replaced, regarded as the specific property of
Iselin & Co., and to be paid over by Dibblee & Co. to Iselin
& Co.
The testimony further showed that Dibblee & Co. were
making preparations for extending their business during
the then approaching "season."
Two members of the firm were examined as witnesses.
One of them thus testified:
"Up to April 30th, I never heard the solvency of our house
questioned, nor had I any reason to suppose that it would sus.

pend. A week or ten days before that .Mr. Dibblee had said to Mr
Bingley and myself, that we had a good prospect for the coming
season. Up to the 30th day of April, 1869, I had no reason to
suppose that the house was not perfectly solvent."
Another thus:
"Though I knew little of the financial condition of Dibblee
& Co., on the 30th April, 1869, I was led to believe by Mr. Dibblee's acts and from the circumstance that a few days before he
directed me to re-engage certain salesmen for the approaching
season, that we were on that day solvent. I did not, of my own
knowledge, know of such solvency. Up to that time, however,
I never heard it questioned."
Both of these witnesses were partners in the house of
Dibblee & Co., and attended to the purchases and sales made
by the house, and were therefore in intercourse with the
parties who sold the house goods. It seemed, therefore, that
they would have been the first to hear any question as to
the credit of the house being doubted.
A witness of the complainant, who, as an expert, had examined their books lately, testified that Dibblee & Co. were
insolvent on the 1st day of August, 1868, to the extent of
at least $75,000, and to a like amount for months previous
to that date. However, subsequently to that date, the defendants purchased in the market Dibblee & Oo.'s notes to
the amount of over $80,000, more than $47,000 being unsecured.
On the 18th of April, 1869, a firm in which one of the
Iselins was a special partner, sold goods to Dibblee & Co.
upon credit for over $24,000, and the amount due them from
Dibblee & Co., at the time of the adjudication in bankruptcy, and proved before the register, was $8851, one of
the largest debts proved.
As already said, the, court below sustained all the transactions except the last. That one it held fraudulent.
Mr. James Emott, for Clark, the assignee in bankruptcy:
1. With regard to the debt of August 6th, 1868, for $61,000.
The evidence shows that Dibblee & Co. immediately took

back and retained the so-called collaterals, and collected the
money as if it had been their own. They doubtless used it
in the same way. The whole transaction, in short, was an
attempt by Iselin to escape the penalties of the Bankrupt
Act, bolster up the credit of what he knew to be a failing
house, and enable Dibblee & Co. to keep working along, so
that he might ultimately, at all events, secure the payment
of his debt.
The transactions and shiftings about the so-called "collaterals" connected with this loan were sustained by the
court below, doubtless, as being a mere exchange of collaterals. But herein lies the fallacy. -Up to the time of hopeless and notorious insolvency, the securities were in the
possession of Dibblee & Co. Iselin & Co. had, in truth, no
collaterals; and when collaterals were really transferred,
Dibblee & Co. had been insolvent for months. It is the case,
therefore, of an old and unprotected debt secured in the very
view of approaching failure. The case of Buchanan v. Smith*
covers this part of the case.
2. The payment of April 8th, 1869. This payment was
made when the firm of Dibblee & Co. were certainly insolvent. Iselin & Co. must have known that fact. They were
substantially the backers of Dibblee & Co. The fact that
the firm was still paying other debts, got with money raised
through fraudulent and secreted warrants of attorney to confess judgment, does not help them.
So far as to transactions sustained by the court below,
and as to which we appeal.
3. As to the confessions of judgment. We take no appeal as
to the action of the court below as to this. That court set
it aside. That this action was right we think plain.
The security was an extraordinary one-not in the usual
course of business, and one which, of itself, is evidence both
of the debtor's precarious condition and of the creditor's
knowledge of it.t
The debtor was hopelessly insolvent and on the verge of

bankruptcy when the confession was filed and the judgment
entered. The preference by means of the judgment was not
given or obtained when the paper authorizing the judgment
was executed and delivered to the creditors, but when it was
used and the judgment was entered. Until then there was
only a continuing consent or authority; the act was done
when the authority was used, and the validity of the act depends upon the conditions existing at that time.*
No doctrine of relation will be recognized by the courts,
which would make an act which was invalid and a fraud
upon the Bankrupt law at the time when it occurred, legal
and valid, because it was promised or agreed to previously,
when the circumstances of the parties were different.
In the language of Judge Hall, in Graham v. Slark,t
"The doctrine would defeat the purposes of the Bankrupt
Act. It would be easy, in every case where it was desired, to
give a fraudulent preference to a relative or other favored creditor, to make such a contract for security when called for; and
such agreementg would be in effect secret liens upon the property of the debtor, and enable him to effect the objects generally
effected before the Bankrupt law under promises to secure relatives and indorsers against loss in any event, by assignments
made for the benefit of such favorite creditors."
If a creditor could hold a warrant of attorney or "confession of judgment" without causing it to be entered of
record, the debtor could readily obtain a false credit.
But the transaction which was set aside by the decree was
even more than this. They went further than to confess a
judgment and suffer a seizure; after they had committed
an act of bankruptcy, they paid this debt of Iselin & Co. by
turning over to the latter all their good assets, their bills
receivable and accounts. It is not important that the Iselins
in fact reaped no advantage from this payment or transfer
of securitids. If they had not expected to do so, and if it

had not been intended that they should, the transfer would
not have been made. The assignee in bankruptcy had a
right to the property of the bankrupts in an unchanged condition. lHe might have contested the levy, stayed the sale
of the goods, and had the goods or their proceeds in court,
to abide the event. The bankrupts and their favored creditors had no right to turn him over to an action against parties who might or might not be responsible, to recover the
value of property to which they had no right.
Messrs. -f. T. Clark and S. P. Bash, contra,for Iselin & Co.
Mr. Justice STRONO delivered the opinion of the court.
It is argued by the counsel for the assignee that the return
to Dibblee & Co..for collection of the notes transferred to
secure the loan of August 6th, 1868, for $61,000, destroyed
the title of Iselin & Co. to them. The notes, however, were
returned to Dibblee & Co. for convenience of collection, to
be collected for account of the defendants or to be replaced
by others.
Obviously this deposit in no degree affected the title of
the defendants to the notes. It merely facilitated collections.
In White v..PlaUt,* it was said by the court that " where promissory notes are pledged by a debtor to secure a debt, the
pledgee acquires a special property in them. That property
is not lost by their being redelivered to the pledgor to enable
him to collect them, the principal debt being still unpaid.
Money which he may collect upon them is the specific property of the creditor. It is deemed collected by the debtor
in a fiduciary capacity."
It is further argued in behalf of the assignee, that the
pledge, on the 5th of April, 1869, of the collaterals, amounting to $62,027.34, was void, because made at that date. The
transaction, however, was a mere exchange of securities.
The new collaterals were not pledged to secure an unsecured
debt, or to give any preference to the defendants. They

were no addition to what the defendants had before; to what
they had held from August 6th, 1868, when the loan to
Dibblee & Co. was made. The exchange, therefore, withdrew nothing from the creditors generally which had not
long before been withdrawn. The defendants owned the
securities they then surrendered, and by surrendering them
they enlarged the debtors' estate to the extent of the securities received in exchange. In Cook v. Tullis,* we held that
there is nothing in the Bankrupt law which prevents an insolvent from dealing with his property-selling or exchanging it for other property-at any time before proceedings in
bankruptcy are taken by or against him, provided such dealing be conducted without any purpose to delay or defraud
his creditors, or to give a preference to any one, and does
not impair the value of his estate. The same doctrine was
asserted in its fullest extent in Tiffany v. Boatman's SavingsInstitution.t
It is argued on behalf of the assignee that the notes discounted by the defendants for the bankrupts in August, 1868,.
were a mere renewal of an antecedent debt, and not a loan
or a discount at that time. If this be conceded it will not
help the assignee. The transaction, whatever it was, was
nine months before the petition for bankruptcy was filed,
and nothing in the thirty-fifth section of the Bankrupt Act
would justify its disturbance. But it is said the transfer of
collaterals to secure the notes was a fraud and a sham, and
this is asserted because the collaterals were placed in ther
hands of Dibblee & Co. for collection on account of the defendants. We do not think so. It has been said already,.
and decided, as we have noticed, that a pledgee does not
lose his property in collaterals pledged to him by putting
them into the hands of the pledgor for collection. In this
case there was peculiar reason for allowing Dibblee & Co. to
collect theni for the defendants. Many of them, nearly -all,
were past due. They could not, therefore, be collected
through banks, and the convenience of all parties was sub18 Wallace, 332.

Opinion of the court.

served by placing them where the debtors might be expected
to come. If, then, the property in these collaterals was by
the pledge vested in the defendants, and remained in them
until they or their proceeds were surrendered for other collaterals, as we think it was, the subsequent exchanges,
though made within four months next prior to the petition
in bankruptcy, were not a fraud upon the Bankrupt law.
The exchanges amounted to no preference. They took
nothing from the debtor's estate. The general creditors
lost nothing thereby. Such was the opinion of both the
District and the Circuit Court, and with that opinion we
concur.
Little need be said respecting the other particulars in regard to which the assignee complains of the decree in the
Circuit Court. The payment of $7944.88 on the 8th of
April, 1869, and the payments in discharge of the call loans
were made in the regular course of business. It is not denied that they were in discharge of debts due to the defendants, and it is not denied that at the times when they were
made Dibblee & Co. were paying their other creditors as
their claims matured. There is nothing in those transactions
that shows any intended preference. And in reference to
all the transactions between the defendants and the bankrupts prior to April 30th, 1869, we may remark that we find
no evidence in the record that the latter contemplated bankruptcy. It is highly probable that they were in fact insolvent, but their whole conduct, as well as the testimony of
two of them, shows that they did not anticipate any interruption of their business. In fact, they were planning its
enlargement. And there is no sufficient evidence that the
defendants knew, or had reason to believe that the bankrupts were insolvent. Up to January, 1869, they were buying the unsecured notes of the bankrupts in the market,
until they had obtained them to an amount exceeding $47,000.
In February, 1869, they lent the bankrupts bonds and other
securities amounting to $54,100, taking, it is true, a confession of judgment, which they did not enter until April

Opinion of the court.

30th, 1869. About the middle of April a firm in which one
of the defendants was a partner sold the bankrupts goods
on credit for more than $24,000, and late in March, and at
divers times in April, down to the 80th, the defendants themselves lent the bankrupts sums amounting to $20,000, without any security, except in part a confession of judgment
never entered. In view of these facts it cannot be said the
defendants knew the bankrupts were insolvent. Nor can
we discover in the whole case anything that should have led
them to suspect insolvency. Nobody else suspected it, why
should they? If, then, the bankrupts intended no preference in fraud of the Bankrupt Act in any of their dealings
with the defendants prior to April 30th, 1869, and if the
defendants had no knowledge of the insolvency of the bankrupts prior to that day, or any reasonable cause to believe
they were insolvent, what ground is there for impeaching
those dealings? We think there is none, and, hence, that
the assignee in bankruptcy has no just cause to complain
that the decree of the Circuit Court was not at leasf as
favorable to him as he had any right to claim.
But the defendants below have also appealed. The Circuit Court decreed partially against them. On the 25th of
February, 1869, Dibblee & Co. gave a judgment note or bill,
in the form authorized by the New York code, to secure
$54,100 loaned by the defendants to them. A portion of
this sum had been advanced on the 21st of February, for
which a judgment bill was then given; another portion on
the 23d of February, for which a similar security was then
given, and the remainder was advanced February 24th. On
the 25th of that month the previous confessions of judgment were given up and destroyed, and one confession for
the entire loan, $54,100, was taken by the defendants. The
advances for which this confession was taken were made in
negotiable State and railroad bonds, of a larger nominal
value, but they were taken by the bankrupts at their actual
cash value at the time. They were made to enable the
bankrupts to borrow money, and upon depositing the securities lent as collateral they obtained $46,000 from three banks

with which they did business. That this transaction thus
far was perfectly legitimate can hardly be doubted, and so
it was regarded by the court below. The bankrupts acquired property by it to the full value of the security they
gave. They parted with nothing that they then had. If
the defendants had known that they were insolvent at the
time it would make no difference. The confession of judgment was not given for a pre-existing debt. And if it had
been, the defendants had, as we have stated, no reasonable
cause to believe that the debtors were insolvent. We may
assume, therefore, that the confession of judgment is unimpeachable. It was held by the defendants without entry of
record until April 30th, 1869, when judgment was entered
upon it in the Supreme Court, as the bill avers, at the request of the defendants, and an execution was issued and
levied upon the debtors' stock of goods, greater in value
than the amount of the debt. Thus the defendants obtained
a lien upon the goods, a full security for the debt due them.
On the next day (May 1st), at the request of the debtors,
they paid to the banks with which the bonds loaned had
been pledged the sums for which they were held, and took
up the collaterals and notes. Thus a payment was effected
on the judgment of the difference between the amount of
the notes and the collaterals. Then Dibblee & Co. paid
$1900 in cash, and transferred bills receivable and accounts
owed by them, amounting to $47,839.52, in full satisfaction
of the balance of the judgment, and the levy of the execution was released.
This transaction the Circuit Court held to be fraudul.ent,
as in conflict with the Bankrupt Act, and decreed that the
assignee of the bankrupts should recover from the defendants the amount received by them from the securities transferred on the 1st of May, together with the $1900 paid to
them in cash, and the value of the securities redeemed by
them from the banks, above the suips which they paid for
the redemption. It is from this part of the decree that the
defendants below have appealed, and they now contend the
rayment, and the transfer of securities made to them by

Oct. 1874.]

CLARK V. ISELIN.
Opinion of the court.

Dibblee & Co. on the 1st of May, was not a preference in
fraud of the Bankrupt Act, or any preference at all.
Whether it was or not obviously depends upon the answer
which must be given to the question, "Was it a transfer of
property for a sufficient present consideration, or was it a
transfer to satisfy or secure an antecedent debt or liability?"
The confession of judgment given on the 25th of February
was, as we have seen, a security to the defendants for a loan
then made, not a security for a pre-existing debt. Giving
and receiving that paper, therefore, cannot be considered a
preference of creditors. The defendants had a clear right
to take and to hold it, and the borrower had a clear right to
give it. Besides, as already remarked, it does not appear
from the evidence that at that time Dibblee & Co. were insolvent. It must, therefore, be concluded, as it was by the
court below, that there was nothing in that transaction which
was fraudulent in fact, or fraudulent as against the Bankrupt law. The confession was not itself a judgment, but it
authorized the defendants to cause a judgment to be entered
without the knowledge of the debtors, and even against
their protest. Was, then, the subsequent entry of the judgment, and the issuing of an execution thereon, followed by
a levy on the debtor's goods, obtaining an unlawful preference? The court below thought it was, but such is not our
opinion. It must be conceded that on the 30th day of April,
when the defendants caused the judgment to be entered, the
execution to issue, and the levy to be made, they knew that
Dibblee & Co. were insolvent; but that knowledge is not of
itself sufficient to invalidate the judgment and execution.
A creditor may pursue his insolvent debtor to judgment and
execution, with full knowledge of the insolvency, notwithstanding the provisions of the Bankrupt Act, provided the
debtor does nothing to aid the pursuit. If there be no collusion between the debtor and the creditor, the ordinary
remedies of the law are open to the latter. In Wilson V. The
City Bank,* it was decided by this court that when a debt is

due, and the debtor is without just defence to the action,
"something more than passive non-resistance of an insolvent debtor to regular judicial proceedings, in which a judgment and levy on his property are obtained, is necessary to
show a preference of a creditor, or a purpose to defeat or
delay the operation of the Bankrupt Act, and that though
the judgment creditor in such a case may know the insolvent condition of the debtor, his levy and seizure are not
void under the circumstances, nor any violation of the Bankrupt law." It was also decided that a "lien thus obtained
by the creditor will not be displaced by subsequent proceedings in bankruptcy against the debtor, though obtained
within four months from the filing of the petition." It is
true that in Wilson v. The G'ty Bank the judgment under
review and the execution thereon were obtained in an ordinary suit at law, to which the debtor made no defence, but
allowed the judgment to be taken by default. In this case
the judgment was entered by the creditor in virtue of what
is called a confession previously made, equivalent to a warrant of attorney to confess a judgment. But it is impossible that can make any difference in its validity. The confession having been lawful when it was given, the subsequent
use of it by the creditors according to its legal effect, a use
to which the debtors were not parties, and of which they
had no knowledge, cannot be illegal. If it is, it must be
because it is made so by the thirty-fifth section of the Bankrupt Act.* But a careful examination of that section will
show that the mere entry of a judgment against an insolvent
debtor, by virtue of a warrant of attorney, though entered
just before the proceedings in bankruptcy are commenced,
and when the creditor knows his debtor is insolvent, and
though followed by an execution, is not such a preference
as the statute avoids. Something more is needed to make
it an unlawful procurement of a preference.
To bring the case of a judgment and execution, or attachment, within the thirty-fifth section of the Bankrupt Act,
several things must concur:

CLARK V. ISELIN.
Opinion of the court.

1. The debtor must have procured the judgment and
attachment of his property.
2. He must have procured them within four months next
prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy by or against
him.
3. He must have been insolvent, or contemplating insolvency, at the time, and he must have procured the judgment
and execution with a view to give a preference to the judgment creditor.
4. The creditor must have had reasonable cause to believe that the debtor was insolvent, and that the judgment
and execution were given in fraud of the provisions of the
Bankrupt Act.
We say these things must concur. And they must concur
not only in fact, but in time also. The words of the thirtyfifth section admit of no other construction. The debtor
must be insolvent, or contemplating insolvency, when the
alleged preference is given. And he must t.en have in view
giving a preference. He must procure the attachment or
the entry of the judgment, the execution, tnd the levy, with
a present intention to prefer the credi' .r. The unlawful
view to a preference must coexist with "he procurement. It
is not enough that it precedes the catry of the judgment
and the levy of the execution, or thAt it follows. And the
creditor, when he obtains the judgment and execution, must
have reasonable cause to believe not only that the debtor is
insolvent, but that the attachment is made (made or caused
by the debtor) in fraud of the provisions of the act. In
fine, there must be guilty collusion to constitute the fraudulent preference condemned by the statute.
Now, in a case where a creditor, holding a confession of
judgment perfectly lawful when it was given, causes the
judgment to be entered of record, how can it be said the
debtor procures the entry at the time it is made? It is true
the judgment is entered in virtue of his authority, an authority given when the confession was signed. That may
have been years before, or, if not, it may have been when
the debtor was perfectly, solvent. But no consent is given

Opinion of the court.

when the entry is made, where the confession becomes an
actual judgment, and when the preference, if it be a preference, is obtained. The debtor has nothing to do with the
entry. As to that he is entirely passive. Ordinarily he
knows nothing of it, and he could not prevent it if he would.
It is impossible, therefore, to maintain that such a judgment
is obtained by him when his confession is placed on record.
Such an assertion, if made, must rest on a mere fiction.
And so it has been decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.* More than this, as we have seen, in order to
make a judgrment and execution against an insolvent debtor
a preference fraudulent under the law, the debtor must have
procured them with a view or intent to give a preference,
and that intent must have existed when the judgment was
entered. But how can a debtor be said to intend a wrongful preference at the time a judgment is obtained against
him when he knows nothing of the judgment? That years
before he may have contemplated the possibility that thereafter a judgment might be obtained against him; that long
before he may have given a warrant of attorney to confess a
judgment, or by a written confession, as in this case, have
put it in the power of his creditor to cause a judgment to be
entered without his knowledge or subsequent assent, is
wholly impertinent to the inquiry whether he had in view
or intended an unlawful preference at a later time, at the
time when the creditor sees fit to cause the judgment to be
entered. For, we repeat, it is a fraudulent intent existing
in the mind of the debtor at this later time which the act of
Congress has in view. The preference must be accompanied
by a fraudulent intent, and it is that intent that taints the
transaction. Without it the judgment and execution are
not void.
This construction of the act of Congress, which appears to
us to be the only one of which it is susceptible, necessitates
the conclusion that the entry of the judgment against Dibblee & Co. on the 30th of April, 1869, the issue of the exe* Sleek v. Turner's Assignee, Legal Intelligencer, September 25th, 1874.

Opinion of the court.

cution thereon, and the levy upon the debtors' stock, were
not fraudulent; that they were not a procurement by the
debtor of a seizure of his property with a view on his part
to give a preference to the defendants, within the meaning
of the thirty-fifth section.
It has been suggested in opposition to the view we have
taken, that if a creditor may hold a confession of judgment
by his debtor, or a warrant of attorney to confess a judgment, without causing it to be entered of record until the
insolvency of the debtor appears, the debtor may thereby be
able to maintain a false credit. If this be admitted it is not
perceived that it has any legitimate bearing upon the question before us. The Bankrupt Act was not aimed against
false credits. It did not prohibit holding judgment bonds
and notes without entering judgments thereon until the
debtors became embarrassed: Such securities are held in
some of the States amounting to millions upon millions.
The Bankrupt Act had a very different purpose. It was to
secure equality of distribution of that which insolvents have
when proceedings in bankruptcy are commenced, and of
that which they have collusively with some of their creditors
attempted to withdraw from ratable distribution, with intent
to prefer some creditors over others. There is much in the
language of the court in Wilson v. The City Bank* that confirms the opinion we express.
If, then, the entry of the judgment, the execution, and the
levy, on the 30th of April, 1869, were not a forbidden preference, as we have endeavored to show they were not, the
transaction on the next day, May 1st, was unimpeachable.
It was only an exchange of values. The debtors transferred
to the execution creditors bills receivable and other securities, together with $1900 in cash, the whole value being
equal to the amount of the judgment, and received back the
goods upon which the execution had been levied. Those
goods were of greater value than the securities transferred
and the money paid. It is not claimed that the defendants

obtained more than they gave in return. The exchange, instead of impairing the debtors' estate, actually benefited it.
It saved the stock levied upon from the expense and sacrifice
of a forced sale. It was, therefore, such an exchange as the
debtors might lawfully make and as the creditors might
lawfully accept. This is determined by Cook v. Tullis,* and

At the same time with the preceding case was adjudged the
case of
WATSON, ASSIGNEE, V. TAYLOR,
In which the doctrines of the preceding case are affirmed and applied to the
case of a note with warrant to confess judgment, given five months

before the petition of bankruptcy was filed against the debtor; the case
showing affirmatively that no fraud was intended when the note with
warrant was given, and that the creditor had no reason to believe that
the debtor was insolvent.
