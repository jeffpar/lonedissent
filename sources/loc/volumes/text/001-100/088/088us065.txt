Statement of the case.

by the law of Minnesota is eminently just in its operation,
and is less severe than that which the common law would
authorize.
We perceive no error in the rulings of the court below,
and the judgment is, therefore,

AfPIRmED.

OLINKENBEARD ET AL. V. UNITED STATES.
On debt upon a distiller's bond to charge him with non-payment of a capacity-tax assessed for an entire month, the distiller may properly show,
that without any fault of his own, and that by the omission of the government itself, he was prevented from operating his distillery for the
first four days for which he was taxed, and that his distillery was inactive from an accident, and in charge of a government officer, as prescribed by law, for four other days. A capacity-tax assessed during
such eight days is erroneously assessed.
Although the act of Congress of July 13th, 1866, declares that no suit
shall be maintained for the recovery of any tax erroneously or illegally
assessed, until an appeal first be made to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue and a decision had, yet this does not prevent the defendant in
a suit brought by the government from setting up as a defence the erroneous assessment or illegality of the tax.
ERROR to the Circuit Court for the Southern District of
Ohio; the case being thus:
The internal revenue law of July 20th, 1868,* in its twentieth section, which relates to distillers, after enacting that
the assessor shall determine each mouth whether the distiller
has accounted for all the spirits produced, and directing how
the quantity shall be determined, thus enacts:
C"In

case the return of the distiller shall have been less

than the quantity thus ascertained, the distiller, or other person
liable, shall be assessed for such deficiency at the rate of fifty
cents for every proof gallon, together with the special tax of 84
for every cask of forty proof gallons.
"But in no case shall the quantity of spirits returned by the

distiller, together with the quantity so assessed, be for a less
quantity of spirits than eighty per centum of the producing
capacity of the distillery; as estimated under the provisions of
this act."
The twenty-second section of the same act, after providing
that from an hour after he has given bond, "every distiller
shall be deemed to be continuously engaged in the production of distilled spirits in his distillery, except in the intervals
when he shall have suspended work as hereinafter authorized or
provided," goes on thus to enact:
"Any distiller desiring to suspend work in his distillery may
give notice in writing to the assistant assessor of his division,
stating when he will suspend work; and on the day mentioned
in said notice said assistant assessor shall, at the expense of the
distiller, proceed to fasten securely the door of every furnace of
every still or boiler in said distillery, by locks and otherwise,
and shall adopt such other means as the Commissioner of Internal Revenue shall prescribe to prevent the lighting of any fire
in such furnace or under such stills or boilers. No distiller,
after having given such notice, shall, after the time stated
therein, carry on the business of a distiller on said premises,
until he shall have given another notice in writing to said assessor, stating the time when he will resume work; and at the
time so stated for resuming work, the assistant assessor shall
attend at the distillery to remove said locks and other fastenings,
and thereupon, and not before, work may be resumed in said
distillery."
The regulations concerning the tax on distilled spirits
under the act of July 20th, 1868,* just quoted, require various things to be done in the establishment of warehouses.t
They say:
"When approved by the commissioner, a storekeeper will be
assigned to such warehouse.
"Such warehouse must be established for each distillery before
any spirits are distilled."

OLINKENBEARD V. UNITED STATES.

Statement of the case.

So far as to the enactments or regulations specially relating to distillers.
Certain statutes relating to the recovery of taxes wrongfully collected, and which apply to them as to other taxpayers, are as follows:
An act of June 30th, 1864,* enacts:
"SECTIoN 44. That the Commissioner of Internal Revenue...
is hereby authorized, on appeal to him made, to remit, refund, and
pay back all duties erroneously orillegally assessed or collected."
Section nineteen of an act of July 13th, 1866,t however,

provides:
"That no suit shall be maintained in any court for the recovery
of any tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed
or collected, until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ... and a decision. of said commissioner be had thereon," &c.
These various statutes and regulations being in force, the
United States sued Olinkenbeard, a distiller, and his sureties, in debt, on his bond given as a distiller, and dated 11th
September, 1868.
Breach, that for the month of October, 1868, Olinkenbeard (the principal) distilled 38,901 proof gallons of spirits,
and that there was a deficiency in his returns of 7977 gallons
for that month; that the said deficiency was duly assessed,
together with the special tax of $4 for every cask of forty
proof gallons of said 38,901 gallons, as required by law,
which deficiency was still due and unpaid; "nor has said
Olinkenbeard... paid the tax which has been duly assessed
upon the aggregate capacity of the said distillery for making
and fermenting grain for the month aforesaid."
Pleas non est faclum and performance; on which pleas issue
was taken.
The plaintiffs, at the trial, gave in evidence the assessment for deficiency referred to in the declaration. The
defendants offered in evidence Olinkenbeard's tri-monthly

returns, regularly made, on which he had paid the tax, and
then offered to show that on the first four days for which
taxes were assessed against him by said assessment of deficiency, he was unable to operate his distillery because no
storekeeper had been assigned by the government to said
distillery; and that for four other days, viz., from 8th to
12th October, he bad, by reason of an unavoidable accident,
been unable to operate said distillery; that he had given
notice required by law of the accident (which notices were
produced), and that the machinery during said time was
securely fastened by an assistant assessor, and remained
fastened, as required by law; and that said four days were
included in said assessment for deficiency.
This evidence was overruled, and a verdict and judgment
were rendered for $4000 against the defendants. A.bill of
exceptions was taken, and the question here was whether
the defence offered by the defendants was competent or not.
Mr. G. H. Williams, Attorney- General, and Mr. S. F. Phillips, Solicitor- General, in support of the view that it was not, and
of the action of the court below:
The breaches assigned in the declaration are, failure to
pay certain taxes assessed, viz., (1) a deficiency tax on about
eight thousand gallons of spirits, together with a special tax
on about thirty-nine thousand gallons; and (2) a capacity tax
on his distillery.
Upon the trial, the plaintiffs gave in evidence an assessment for a deficiency; and thereupon the defendants offered
to show that for several days during the month for which
such assessment had been made, his distillery had been idle.
This evidence was properly excluded.
1st. The case does not show that the assessment was upon
the capacity of the distillery. It may be that the quantity of
material returned by the distiller as actually used by him during the
month warranted the assessment made, and that there was no
need to apply the rule of the statute merely imputing 80 per
cent. production. The assessment in question may amount
to more than 80 per cent. We see nothing in the case to

Opinion of the court.

warrant the assumption in the brief of the learned counsel,
that this was a mere capacity-tax.
If the assessment were because of material actually used,
then the plaintiffs in error have no case.
2d. Supposing this were a mere capacity-tax, then the
assessment is final against the principal, because of his failing to appeal therefrom to a commissioner. It is equally so
with the sureties, the plea being as it is, joint. Unless the
defence made out under it is good for all, it fails for all.*
Messrs. Iloadly and Johnson, contra,for the plaintiff in error.
Mr. Justice BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the court.
If the facts were as set up in the defence, it is difficult to
see how the assessment in this case could have been legal.
The distiller, without any fault of his own, but by the omission of the government itself, was prevented from operating
his distillery for the first four days for which he was taxed,
and his distillery was inactive from an accident, and in
charge of a government officer, as prescribed by law, for
four other days. He could not, without a breach of law,
commence distilling till a storekeeper was assigned him, and
he acted in compliance with the law when his distillery was
stopped by accident. To charge him with the capacity-tax
during those eight days was unjust and oppressive.
It is suggested by the government counsel that the case
does not show that the assessment was upon the capacity of
the distillery; that the quantity of material returned by him
as actually used during the month may have warranted the
assessment. But the offer was to show that the assessment
included those eight days, and the declaration charges, as a
breach, that Clinkenbeard did not pay the tax assessed upon
the aggregate capacity of the distillery for the month in
question. So far as appeared the facts set up in defence
rendered the assessment clearly illegal.
But another point raised by the government counsel is
* United States v. Linn, 1 Howard, 104.

CLINKENBEARD V. UNITED STATES.

[Sup. Ct.

Opinion of the court.

that the assessment, not having been appealed from, was
res judicata and conclusive, and defendant was precluded
from showing the contrary.
It is true that the Internal Revenue Act of 1864 authorizes the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on appeal to
him made, to remit, refund, and pay back all taxes erroneously or illegally assessed or collected,* and the amended
act of July 13th, 1866, declares that no suit shall be maintained for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been
erroneously or illegally assessed or collected until such appeal shall have been made, and a decision had.t The suit
thu prohibited is a suit brought by the person taxed to
recover back a tax illegally assessed and collected. This is
different from the case now under consideration, wbich is a
suit brought by the government for collecting the tax, and
the person taxed (together with his sureties) is defendant
instead of plaintiff. No statute is cited to show that he cannot, when thus sued, set up the defence that the tax was
illegally assessed, although he may not have appealed to the
commissioner.
Is he precluded by any general rule of law from setting
up such a defence? Has an assessment of a tax so far the
force and effect of a judicial sentence that it cannot be
attacked collaterally, but only by some direct proceeding,
such as an appeal or certiorari, for setting it aside ?
It is undoubtedly true that the decisions of an assessor or
board of assessors, like those of all other administrative
commissioners, are of a quasi judicial character, and cannot
be questioned collaterally when made within the scope of
their jurisdiction. But if they assess persons, property, or
operations not taxable, such assessment is illegal and cannot
form the basis of an action at law for the collection of the
tax, however efficacious it may be for the protection of ministerial officers charged with the duty of actual collection by
virtue of a regular warrant or authority therefor. When
the government elects to resort to the aid of the courts it

must abide by the legality of the tax. When it follows the
statute its officers have the protection of the statute, and
parties must comply with the requirements thereof before
they can prosecute as plaintiffs.

The

JUDGMENT REVERSED,

and
A

VENIRE DE NOVO AWARDED.

Mr. Justice CLIFFORD, with 'whom concurred Justices
SWAYNE, DAVIS, and STRONG, dissenting:
I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the court in
this case because the evidence offered by the distiller to
show that the assessment in question covered eight days in
which his distillery could not be operated was not an answer
to the whole declaration; nor could it be, as the assessment
was for a deficiency and covered the regular tax for a whole
month.
Suppose the evidence was admissible, still if it had been
admitted it would only have shown that the assessment was
excessive in amount, in which state of the case all will agree,
I suppose, that the defence must have failed, as the case
showed that no appeal had ever been taken to the Secretary
of the Treasury, as required by the act of Congress.
Such must be the rule, else it will follow that nothing can
be collected of the taxpayer in any case where the assessment is for an amount greater than that authorized by law,
which is a proposition at war with the whole system of Federal taxation.

MAXWELL V. STEWART.
1. Where there is no assignment of error, the defendant in error may either
move to dismiss the writ, or be may open the record and pray for an
affirmance.

2. In a suit upon a judgment of a sister State, objections to the form and
sufficiency of the evidence offered to prove the record on which the
action is brought cannot be sustained; the document offered being properly certified to be " a true and faithful copy of the record of the proceecings had in the cause."
