WALRE- &

The Court below ought not to have rejected the testimuny to prove the intentiun of the surveyor to run the
lines of these grants by the true meridian. It corroborates the plat annexed to the -grant. The rule of constructionas to grants from tie state, especially in Virginia, N. Carolina and Tennessee, diffiqrs from the rule
as to 9tiler deeds. Course and distance may be controled by parol evidence .of the actual manner inwhich
the survey mas niade,-andof the actualmarks and bounds
made upon the land at the time or the survey. The
Courts have not stdpped at a natur ,1object called for,

of the surveyor? How shall it be ascertained? The
most direct mode of ascertaing it is to prove! his ddclarAtions .tthe time. It is true that by proving what was

The general practice of tie country is to survey by
the compass, and ll the courses expressed in surveys
refer tj the magnetic meridian. A certificate of survey
therefore is always supposed to express magnetic courses
unless the contrary is expressed on its face. No parol proof can be admitted to contradict what is so strongly implied. It would be a dangerous practice-it would.
be a difficult thingIor a common surveyor to ascertain
the true meridian, and there is no I \v of North Carolina which compels him to do it. The testimony offered
vas not to prove any act of the surveyor, but his intentions.
There is no natural boundary called for in the patent, The general expression'that the land is on Crow
Creek, cannot control the course and distance. The
expression in the patent ",as by the plat hereunto annexed will appeal;," refers only to the courses and distances, and not to the actual location of the land. The
figure of a creek delineated on the plat, without any reference to it in the certificate of survey, catinot control
the boundaries actually described. Not a word is said'
about the lines including or crossing Crow Creek; and'
in order to include the creek you must deviate from the
straight line called for.
C. LEE, in reply.

The intent of a grant must be effectuated, if by ani
means, consistent "with the rules of law, it can' be done.
The intent of this grant cannot be' effectuated by the
mode of survey directed by the Court below. The plat4
annexed to thegrant, shows the intent to be to make the
-survey conform t,) the nature of the grfind so as to i.
elude the.creek and the valley, and exclude the moun'
tains. The law of North Carolina requires thoplat to,
b6 ann.exed to the deed. which is thereby, and by tho
reference to it in the body of the deed,- made .a part
thereof; and contains a plain .declaration that thw granj
tee shall have the valley through which the creek.runs;

the absence of positive testimony, what the intent of the
surveyor was. It was a grade of evidence inf-ri-r to
positive testimony of the intention. It was only prima
facie, not conclusive evidence of his meaning. There
was no law of North Carolina which required the surveyor to go by the magnetic, and not by the true meridian. He was at full liberty to adopt the true meridian
if hepleased. We say he did so, and the plat itself isevidence-of the fact; for it could not otherwise be consistent
with itself. You must run the lines according to the
true meridian to include the creek.

Does not a difficulty arise in consequence of the grant
having been made without actual survey?
C. LEn.. That is a matter between the state and t.e
grantee. After a grant, no stranger can take advantage of such a defect. The state may wave the objection if it chuses to do so.

Ithas been settled, I believe in North Care
lina that when a grant has actually been made, n,- enquiry shall be made by the state as to the survey, &c.
In Hayward's Rep. 358 the judge says, -when ti

D usuAuL, Ch. J: after stating the facts of the case,
delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:

",It is undoubtedly the practice of surveyors, atd
the practice was proved in this cause, to expr:ess in their
plats and certificates of survey, the courses which are
designated by the needle; and if nothing exists to control the call for course and .istance, the land must be

mti mL's bounded by the courses and distances of the patent, ac
LHiS
cordingtb the magnetic meridian. Bat it is a general
S". principle that the course and distance must yield to naWALKER& inral objects valled Â° for.in the patent. All lands are
ANOTIUR. supposed to be actually surveyed,, and the intention of
tihe grant is to convey the land according to that actual
survey ; consequently if marked trees and marked cur,
ners be fouinid conformably to the calls of the patent, or
if water-courses be called for in the patent, or mountains
or any other natural objects, distances must be lengthened or shortened, and courses varied so as to conform
to those objects.
The reason of the rule is. that it is the intention, of
the grant to convey the land actually surveyed, and mistakes in courses or distances, are more probable :and
more frequent" thau in marked trees, mountains, rivers
or other natural objects caiable of being- clearly designated and accurately described. Had the survey in this
case, been *actually made, and the lines had called to
cross Crow Creek, the courses and distances might
have been precisely What they are, it might have been
impracticable to find corner or other marked trees antl
yet'the, land must have been so sni'veyed as to include
Crow Creek. The call, in the lines o' the patent, to
cross Crow Creek, would be one to which course and
distance must necess'irily yield. This material call is
mi~ted, an,] from its omission arises the great difficulty
of the cause.
That the lands- should not be described as lying on
bath sideq of Crow Creek, ni the lines call 11or crossing
that creek, ar such extrordinary omissions as tocreate consid-rabl- doubt with tho Court in dridinq whether tere is any. other descril)tion given, in the patent,
of s.iTi ient strength to control the call fop course and
distance.
'The injoritv of the Court is of opinion that there is
such a description.

'e nothing to lead to a diffirent conclusion, but a difference of about five degrees in tl.e ctstrse, should lie run
out the whole chain of surves in order to find the beginning of No. i2; and he would know that such an error in the course would le corrected by such a gi eat natural object as a creek laid down bi the swu've)or ii the
middle..of his -plat. This would prbve, notwithstauding
the error in. the course, that the lands pn both sides of
Crow Creek were intended to beixicluded in'the, survey,
and intended to be granted by the patent.
It is the opinion of the majority of this Court, that
there is'error in the opinion of the Circuit Court Vir
the district'ofEastTennessee in this, that 0 c said C ult
.instructed thejury that the grant, under which the Plaintiff claimed, could not be legally run so as to include
Crow Creek, instead of directing the jury that the said
grant must be o run as to* include Crow Creek, and to
conform as near as may be to the plat annexed to the
said grant; wherefore it is considered b) this Court
that the said judgment be reversed and annulled and the
cause be remanded to the said Cirpuit Court that a new
trial may be had according to law.
The chief justice, added, that lie did unot think the
question about 'the true meridian had much to.do with
the case. The Cburt decided it upoi the plat. If it
had not been for the plat, they should have said thatthe land ought to be gurveyed by the magnetic meri.
