When the Defendant and the other officers of the United States went to look for the place to erect the garrison in pursuance ,fthe reserve, they went first below
the mouth of Highwassee; But it was a low and marshy country, affording no good scite fpr a garrison and
no water or spring was to be had there.
The Plaintiff's counsel insisted- that the Indian title to
the land was extinguished and that he had a right to recover, and prayed the Court so t instruct the jury ; to
which the Defendant's counsel objected and insisted that
the D efendants were entitled to recover against the
Plaintiff, because the Indian title was not extinguished;
and because the land. -as occupied by the United StateW'
troops, and the Defendants as officers of the United
States, for the benefit of the United States, and by their
direction; and hecaus6 the garrison was erected on the
land really reserved for that purpose by the treaty;
as they insisted it was out of the land ceded that '
*eserve was made. That it must, by the letter of tt.,treaty, be understood to be land reserved to the
indians, out of the part ceded, and not a reserve in
favor of the United States, out of the land not
ceded by the Indians; and that the term t reserve' in
the treaty controlled the other expressi, ns, "copposite

" and beloidwthe nouth of WBglvassee." That the United States had a right by the constitution to appropriate
the property of individual citizens; and that the line
run, was the true line of the reservation.
Btithe Court over-ruled the objections of the De'endant's counsel, and charged the ju'ry that the lant reserr.

except such tracts as were expressly reserved for the
Indions, was extinguished; and that the three square

C.*1 Ev,,for the Plaitffs in Error.
The points in dispute in this cause are 5tated in the bill
of etceptions. The principal. question is whether the
three miles reserved for the .ise of the United Statcs are.
to lay below or above the mouth of the Highwnassee.
We say that it vas the -intention of the parties that
th.y should lye above.. Theexpression ,,reserved" imports an exceptjon to the cession. The reservation mIust
have been out of the land qeded. The United States
hould, notreseive what was not theirs before; but for
the accommodation of the Indians'they reserve three milk square for the mse of the United States, It was intended'lo prevent. the extinguishment of the Indilin.titte to sb
much in order to preventindividuals frdm pnrchasinit.
The: letter of Smith and Meigs to the secretary of waX
shows that the land wag to revert to Douhlehead and two
others, ;whenever the-l nited Sttes should cease to have
a use for it. It was therefore clearly a reserve, or exceftion from the feneral operation of.the grant. It'
would be inconsistent with the faith of the treaty to s.ur-fer'any individual to i6ssnss it.,

Jons, cmtra,
Relied -upon the. plain wbrds"of the:treaty.
The word "creserve" is the only thing that can justify
a question; but it means :,to appropriate" to ,,'et apartV'
to hold it for the, use.of the U. States, for the pjurpose
of a garrison, but not to make an.absolute grant irceg-.
sion of the. land.' The expression ",three othor square
miles," Â§hgws ihat they meant other tbanthe land ceded.
I The lette is not eyidence; it is no part of the treaty;
it was never ratified by.the senpte; and Is unimportant
if it .was. It, however, shows that there was Io mistake
in te w6rd.,, beloo" in the treaty.

Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the Court

as follows:
The land for which this ejectmeht was brought, lies
withjn the territory ceded to the 'United States by the
state of North Carolina, and was claimed by a patent
anterior to that cessi6n. At the date of the grant, the
Indian title had not been extinguished. On the 2bth day
of October, 180.5, a treaty was mttde betWeen the United
States'and the Cherokee indlian% in which the' ldians
ceded to the United States , all the land lying to the
" rlorth of the following boundary line ; beginning at the
"mouth ofDuck river, running thence upthe main stream
",of the same to the junction of the fork, atthe head of

The question on which the cause has been placed is
this. Is thin land, claimed by tl e Plaintiff in the Court
below, within the ceded territory?

The line mentioned in the treaty has been run, and LF-SBE.
,
the land in controvers) lies on the porth side of it, and eousequeutly within the limits ceded to the Uno vd States;
but there \as a further stipfnaiamdn in the treaty, which
the Plaintiffs in error say comprehcnds the lauds for
which this suit hs brought.
After dkscribing the ceddd territory, the treaty proceeds to say: --And Whereas from the wi'srent -c'ssion
,1 made by the.Cherokees, and other circunm.Stances, 'the
"scites of the 'garrisuns at South west p tsine Pnd 'lrdico
"9are become not the nwost convenient and 46itahle pla" ces fort e aecommodation of the said Indians, it may
-become expedient to remove the said 4grrisins and
"factory to sotne more suitableplaet," three othrrsquare
miles.are reserved fbr the particular disposal of the United States on the north bank of the. Tennessee opposite.
to and below the mouth of Highwassee.
The.cedea territory lies above the mouth of Highvassep, as does the land in controversy ; yet the Plaidtiffs in error contend that this land Is within the stipulation for a reserve of three square miles to lie below the
mouth of Highwassce.
They' attempt to sustain this proposition by alleging
that the word ,, belnw" was inserted irt thp treaty by
mistake, when the word -9above" was intended.
This mistake ought certainly to be very clearly demoitstrated, before the Courts -of the United 'States can
found upon its existence a jtuogment which shall deprive
a citizen of his property.
. The argument, so far as it is drawn from tne treaty
itself, rests on the word" reserved." It is said that the
lauds - reserved for the particnlar disposal of the Ui.itcd
States," must necessarily be a part of the cedhed territor7, or the term would not aptly express the idea 6f the
parties.

"Three other square miles," that is,.other than tloso be.

The counsel for the Plaintiffs in error also rely on a
letter written by-tie commissioners who negotiated the
treaty tQ the secretary of war on tie J0th day of January, 1806. . But, without inquiiin.,, into the weight to
which such a letter is intiled in such a case, it is to be
observed that the letter agrees with the terms, of tho
treaty. It says that the three square miles reserved for
the particular disposal of the U. States, were ",opposite to
and below thie mo,,th of the Highwassee." .It is t1uiecessa,.
ry to make-a farther c6mment on this letter than to say,
that there is no eixpression in it which appears to' the

Court to countenance, in the slightest degree, the idea
that the word ,, below" in the treaty was used by mistake'instead of the word "above."

Tl'e tacts, that the agents of the United States took

possession" of this laud lying above the month of the
buildings thereon, and
expensive
ercid
l a ea garrison
placed
there,
cannot be admitted to give ani
explanati 'n to the treaty, which would "contradict its
plain Words aid -,bvitils meaning. The land is certainIv the pro perty of tie Plaintiff below; and tbe United
Stites cannot have intended to deprive htim of it hy eiolnce, and without coinpnsation. This Court is unanimously and clearly of opinion that the Circuit Court
comn-itted no error in instructing the jury that the In.
dian title was extint4uished to the land in controvorsy,
and that the Plaintiff below might suslaih his action.
The judgment is affirmed with costs.
