had been paid by the-French overnment on the 7th of
January preceding, and Boss saw the proceeds of hlie

signed the account, stating that when the monies were re- PLuuoT
ceived on the bills from Hotel, Thomas & Co. the & Lr,
amount should be passed to the credit of 'Taber, Gardner and Boss. Perrott and'Lee afterwards received the
whole balance of the said account from Taber, Gardner
and Boss, not having credited the proceeds of the said
bills; and the present suit is brou.ght by Taber, surviving partner of Taber and Gardner, the original holders
of the bills, to recover their amount.
The principal exception was to the charge of thejudge
who directed the jury to find forthe Defendants, on the
ground that the witness, Bosi, had not been made a party Plaintiff in the suit.
The case was argued by Pi B. KEY, for the Plaintiff
in error, and by HuxTEE, for the Defendants.

Felraaryi5th. Absent ....TIODD, J.
M1AutsHx1z,

Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the Court

as follows :
This suit was brought by the Plaintiffh in error, in the
Circuit Court of the United States, for the distript of
Rhode Island, to recover from the Defendants the amount
of certain bills drawn by genefal Le Clerk on the government of France.
The declaration contains several counts, some special,
stating agreements between the parties for the payment
of tile bills; others general, among which is a count for
money had and received by the Defendants, to the use of
the Plaintiffs.
It appeared, at the trial, that the Plaintiffs and John
L. Boss, were concerned in certain commercial specula.
tions, in the prosecution of wihich John L. Bogs sailed,
in 1802 and 1803, to Bourdeaux, in the Polly, with car-

goes in which they were jointly interested. On the first
voyage, Boss carried with him the bills of exchange for
the amount o'which this suit was brought, indorsed ,in
blank by the Plaintift, Gardner, which he delivered to

the Defendants for collection. The amount, whon col.
leetted, was to be placed to the credit of the return cargo
of the Polly, in which the Plaintiff and John L. Buss
were jointly concerned. The account was settled with~out giving credit for the amount of these hills; and Taber, Gardner and Boss have been compelled to pay the
balance acknowledged to he due. This action was
brought to charge the Defendants with the bills, alleging that their amount has been received.
At the trial, the Plaiutiffs offered Boss as awitness, for
the. purpose of proving the liability of the Defendants for
the amount of the bills. He swore that he had no interest,in the cause nor in the bills; but his testimony was
objected to by the Dcfendants on the ground of his being
interested ; and the Court was moved to instruct thejul-

ry that the action could not be sustained, because Boss
was hot a party Plaintiff in the declaration. This direction was given by the Court, and excepted to by the
counsel for the Plaintiffs. A verdict and judgment
were rendered for the Defendants, whiph,are brought
into this Court by writ of error.
t

The Defendants in error contend, that the ills of exchange were part of the cargo of the Polly, and consequently the joint property of thec owyners of that cargo.
JBut of this there is no other evidence than that Boss
was the bearer of those bills indors.-d in blank, and that
their proceeds, if received, were to be placed to the accoint of the. return cargo. This might very well be, and
yet Taber and Gardner remain the sole owners of the
bills. Their amount, if received, might be credited to
all the partners ill their account with Perrott and Lee,
and then be credlited to.Tabor and Gaerlre in settling
tht, accounts of the partnefship.. Boss then would have
no interest in tie bills, unless they should be collected and
carried to tile credit of tire retairn cargo. That account
having been settled without including this item, itis not
necessarily impli,-d, from the farts in the case, that Boss
was interested : and he. swears that lie was not. This
Court is of opinion that the Circuit Court erred in directing the testimony of Boss to be disregarded ; and
als, in directing the jury to find for time Defendants be,
cause he was not made a party Plaintiff in the suit.

FEBRUARY TERM 1815.
Several other opinions were given by the judge, to TABY.U
which exceptions: were taken; but it is unnecessary to
W.
review them as they depended on the op.tion that Boss rxun0TT
was interested in the bills for whicli the action -was & LnB.
brought.
The judgment is reversed, and the cause sent back
for a new trial.
