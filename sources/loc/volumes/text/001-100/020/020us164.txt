from the Supreme Court of the State of

Ohio, being the highest Court of equity of that State,
under the 25th sec. of the judiciary act of 1789,
c. -O.
The bill filed by the plaintiff, Matthews, in the
State Court, was brought for the purpose of obtaining from the defendants, Zane and others, a conveyance of a tract of land to which the plaintiff alleged
that he had the equitable title, under an entry, prior
to that on which a grant had been issued to the de-

OF THE UNITED STATES.

fendants°

The validity of his entry descended on
the construction of the act of Congress of May 19th,
1800, c. 209., the 6th section of the act of March 3d,
1803, c. 33., and the act of the 26th of March,
1804, c. 388., all relating to the sal of the public
lands in the territory northwest of the river Ohio.
The case stated, that on the 7th of February, 1814,
the plaintiff applied to the Register of the Marietta District, and communicated to him his desire to
purchase the land in controversy. The office of Receiver being then vacant, no money was paid, and no
entry was made ; but the Register took a note or
memorandum of the application. On the 12th of
May, 1804, soon after the Receiver had entered on
the duties of his office, the plaintiff paid tne sum of
money required by law, and made an entry for the
land in controversy, with the Register of the Marietta District. In pursuance of the 12th section of
"the act of the 26th of March, 1804, c. 388., and of
instructions from the secretary of the treasury, the
sale of the lands in the District of Zanesville, (which
had been formed out of the Marietta District, and included the land in controversy,) commenced on the
3d Monday fo May, 1804, and on the 26th of that
month the defendants became the purchasers of the
same land. There were several charges of fraud in
the bill, and a contract between the parties was alleged ; but as the opinion of this Court turned exclusively on the title of the parties under the act of Congress, it is deemed unnecessary to state these circumstances. The State Court having determined against
the validity of the plaintiff's title under the act of

Mr. Doddridge, for the appellant, stated, that tne
cause depended upon the construction of three acts
of Congress, which he insisted had been misconstrued by the State Court. The first of these acts, that
of May 10th, 1800, c. 209., established the present
system of selling the public lands in Districts, and by
that statute the land in controversy was within the
Marietta District. The 6th section of the act of the
5d of March, 1803, c. 34., created an additional
District, and provided that the lands within it should
be offered for sale, at Zanesville, under the direction
of a register and receiver, to be appointed for that
purpose, who should reside at that place. The 12th
section of the act of the 26th of March, 1804, C.388.
directs the lands in the District of Zanesville to be
offered for public sale on the third Monday of May
in that year.
On the first view of the case, difficulties present
themselves, on the side of the appellant, in the authority of previous decisions, and especially a decision of this Court, between the same parties.a But
that decision resulted from an incorrect and imperfect statement of facts in the former case. Circumstances which are now disclosed did not appear in
that case. jUpon the present record the following

was the practical construction given to those laws
by executive officers, which ought in the present
case to be conclusive, because it fulfils every object
of the law, preserves the private rights of individuals, and if set aside by a mere technical objection,
would open a door for the most extensive litiga:ion
and disturbance of titles acquired under the land
laws of the United Stales. (3.) That supposing the
act of March -30, 1803, had in express terms, or by
necessary and inevitable implication, taken away the
power of sale at Marietta, yet it could not begin to
have that effect, until duly promulgated at that
place, it not having in fact been transmitted to the
officers at Marietta, until after the plaintiff's entry.
The land laws must certainly- be considered as
forming a part of the contract between the Government, and each individual who wishes to become a
purchaser of the public domain. If contracts between the public and individuals are to ne considered
in the same light as contracts between individuals,
then the principle applies that a bonafide and innocent purchaser, from an agent who has not received
due notice that his authority is superceded, shall not
be injured by the negligence of the principal, in not
giving notice.a The rule§ of interpretation applicable to the present case, are laid down by the elea 4 Hail'sLaw Journal, 16. 2 Dall. 320

the words immediately preceding, but usually extended to the whole antecedent phrase. "
"These are copious maxims, and, with half a dozen more, are the stars by which we steer, in the
construction of all public and private writings."a
So, also, this Court has laid it down as "a well
established principle in the exposition of statutes,
that every part is to be considered, and the intention
of the legislature to be extracted from the whole. It
is also true, that when great inconvenience will result
from a particular construction, that construction is
to be avoided, unless the meaning of the legislature
be plain, in which case it must be obeyed. "b
1. In enforcing the construction we contend for, the
further considerations which present themselves under the 'first point are-That all the land laws
passed previous to the act of May 10th, 1800, merged in that act; and by it, the system of selli6g the
public lands in districts, through agents called registers and receivers, was settled : so.that at the passage
of the act of March 3, 1803, that sysrem in all its
relations, was the law ; and to all the provisions of
the act of May 10th, 1800,-and the rights established
thereby, that of March 3, 1803, expressly refers, and
for its operative capacity necessarily depends.

provement. The right of every individual is, to appropriate to himself any tract of land within the provisions of the system. Words are not necessary to
show the importance of the public policy in both
its branches; and the interest felt by the community, in the right to appropriate,is of equal extent,
and as strong-as distinctly marked, too, as the policy itself; and, though a right peculiar to the American people, is, nevertheless, a general right ; requiring, indeed, to be regulated by law; but none will
saytha t the government might, or could wholly repress its exercise, any more than wholly to repress
the exercise of the general right to carry on trade
and commerce.
The second branch of the public policy-also
the right to acquire and improve new lands-did
not commence with the land laws of the United
States; both existed undei, and the latter was exercised through, the regulations of colonial and State
government, are coeval with the settlement of America ; and when the same policy and right fell within the
jurisdiction of the national government, laws were
immediately passed to regulate them, and have been
continued from time to time, until they all merged
in the act of May 10th, 1810; so that the right of
every individual in the community to purchase and
settle any part of the lands within the provisions of
that act, may emphatically be called an existing
right.

gaged the attention of the national government immediately after the termination of the revolutionary
war, and has been pursued by it ever since, with an
undeviating aim; and it may be here observed. -that
one condition in the cession from Virginia is, that
the lands ceded shall be sold, and the proceeds go in
discharge of the public debt. It is not denied that
Congress may suspend the sale of the whole or any
part of the public lands; but doubtless, in such case,
there would appear some distinct and good reason for
doing it, as in the act of May 10, 1800, in order to
attain, more effectually, the objects of the whole system; and then the intention was expressed with irresistible clearness in the repealing clause. But where
nothing of this kind is pretended, where no object or
motive can be perceived leading to suspension, the
implication must be strong indeed to induce a court
of justice to suppose a design to depart from every
-prificiple of the law in the case.
The constitution and the law show, that the President had no power to establish the Zanesville offices until after the next meeting of -Congress; for
those offices were not vacancies to be filled during the
recess; and it will not be contended, -that he was
bound to summon a special meeting of the Senate for
that purpose. Furthermore, the President had no
power to cause sales to commence at Zanesville, until, in some act subsequent to that of,March 3, 1803,
the time for opening sales should be appointed ; and
we shall now endeavour to show the correctness of
that position. The words of the act of March 3,
1803, (sections 5. and 6.) refer, generally, to the act

of May 10th, 1800, and embrace all the regulations
prescribed, among which a prominent one is, that all
the land must be offered at public sale before
being offered at private sale, and that a day
should be appointed by law when sales are to
commence at each office. The object of public sale,
when any tract of country is brought into market
for the first time, is, principally, the enhancement of
price above the legal limitation, by means of competition for the most valuable tracts ; but it has another of some importance, that is, settling in this way
the preference between competitors.
The fair inference from these considerations is,
that no sale of any part of the unappropriated lands
in the military tract could legally take place, either
at Zanesville or Chillicothe, under the bare provisions
of the act of March 3, 1803 ; that some farther legislative provision was necessary, appointing the
time when sales should commence. This provision
is found in the act of March, 26th, 1804. It it true,
that in another act passed, also, the 3d March, 1803,
"regulating the granits of land, and providing for the
sale of the public lands south of Tennessee," the time
when sales are to commence is left with the President ; but it is to be by proclamation, giving due notice. This is a modification only of the practice under the same principle and policy..
But it may be said, the act of May 10, 1800, excepts from public sale a part of the Marietta District,
and all the Steubenville District. This is true; and
the reason for this exception is not readily perceived. The only probable one is, that all the part excepted in the Marietta District was known to be a

rough, hilly country, therefore no prospect of sales
• it. The distinction, on
being immediately effected in

any other account, between the west of the Mtiskingand the
um, including the township intersected by -it,
lands lying east of those towvnshi s. seems to be idle.
With respect to the Steubenville District, all the most
valuable lands in it had been sold in New-York, in
1787, and at Pittsburgh, in 1796; therefore, the
competition to be expected at public sale was not
thought of sufficient importance to be secured by statutory provision. But whatever may have been the
reason for excepting these lands from public sale,
the principle offiring by law the time when the private sale of them shall commence is still preserved ;
thus securing the equitable mode of settling by lot the
preference between applicants for the same tractt
provided for in the act of May 10th. In fine, the
reference of the act of March 3, 1803, to that of
May 10, 1800, is general, therefore embraces the general provisions only; and the correct conclusion from
a whole view of this matter is, th'at the act of March
8, 1803, was inchoate, inoperative of itself, in respect
to sales at Zanesville, and, therefore, it would be absurd to give to it a constructive repeal of the preceding statute.
All that has been urged against suspending sales
at Marietta until the operative organization of the
Zanesville District took place, applies with equal
force to the act of March 26, 1804, as to that of
March 3, 1803. The absurdity is just as great in
principle; the only difference is, its effects are not of
so long continuance. Besides, the act of March 26,

the Register of the Zanesville District to the construction for which we contend.
There is no diTe ence, in regard to construction,
between a law which definitively appoints the time
when a certain thing is to be done in future, and a
law which leaves indefinite thefuture time when that
certain tlking is to be done; and practically, there
is less reason to give the subsequent statute a repealing operation from the day of its passage, in the lgtter, than in the former case, because, there is less inconsistency in suspending the existing rights of in-,
dividuals, and the public interest and policy for a certain, than for an uncertain time. Resting with.some
confidence in this position, we shall here introduce a
case precisely in point, to show, that the repugnant
words are not alone and abstractedlyto be considered.,

61. the plaintiff shall not recover costs : yet from a
necessary construction of the whole act, a plaintiff
shall recover costs in an action commenced in another court, for a debt between 40s. and 51. after the
passage of the act, and before the 30th of September.
Till then he could not sue in the Court of Requests,
and therefore had no other remedy but to sue in another court."

act; but they were not allowed to suspend the existing right to sue somewhere.
The admissions heretofore made, that is, that had
the day been appointed when sales were to commence at Zanesville, they might have been continued at Marietta up to such day, seems to render a reference to the above case unnecessary, in respect to
former arguments on the other side; but those admissions may not be extended to the present hearing:
and, besides, the cited case shows. that the same
kind of reasoning has been resorted to on other occasions, that it has been put down by the court, and
that the whole law and practical reason are the only
sure guides to sound construction. In every proposition importing that the lands taken from the Marietta District "shall be sold at Zanesville," these repugnant words must be used; and when the object
is to give them an abstract repealing effect from the
moment they are used by the legislature, it matters
not when1 sold at Zanesville."
2. The second point in our argument is, that the
complainant's purchase was made conformably to
the practical construction given to the laws in question by the proper executive officers. This relates,
principally, to the Secretary of the Treasury, the
superintendant of the whole ; but extends also to
the Register of the Marietta District, who, being
without instructions, had to act upon his own discretion.

The facts in the bill show, that laws affecting the
offices are received, by the respective officers,

through the Treasury Department, with instructions;
it therefore follows, that had the Secretary of the
Treasury construed the act of M'arch 3,,1803, as suspending sales at Marietta, he would have given instructions to that effect. This deduction flows by
such strong implication from the facts and the nature
of the case, that direct proof, if susceptible of beidg
had, would be unnecessary: it is, in fact, involved
in the acknowledgment of the Secretary of the
Treasury, that his first impressions, (that is, that all
sales made at Marietta, after the passing of the act
of March 3, 1803, were void, as suggested by the
private opinion of the Register of the Zanesville District,) were erroneous; and without saying any
thing more than has been said, in relation to the act
of March 26th, 1804, we may confidently assume
the fact'stated as the foundation of this point ; and
shall now endeavour to show that the conclusion
drawn from it is correct.
The true doctrine of'executive construction is,
that, generally, it is to be considered and respected :
for executive officers are officers of the constitution
and laws, as well as the judges; and in the performance of their proper functions, the former are under
the necessity of putting a construction on the acts
of the legislature, as well as the latter : and it may
be added, that they are always -supposed to act under the advice of a high law officer, appointed for
that purpose. When- in this necessary exercise of
theirjudgment, they put such a construction on a

177

statute as promotes its evident object, preserves all
the rights of individuals) and which at the same
time becomes a rule by which title to things real or
personal is acquired, such construction ought not to
be set aside by a rigid criticism of any kind ; but
where it injures the public interest, or abridges and
restrains the rights of individuals, it should be strictly examined and corrected.
When executive constructions and regulations form
the rule by which the most interesting of all titles,
the title to land, is acquired, all must see and admit
the reasonableness of preserving rights growing out
of them. Executive construction, in such cases,
acquires all the importance, and involves all the consequences, of judicial decisions. Could it be established, that the Secretary of the Treasury had misconstrued the act of March 3, 1803, in permitting
sales to be made at Marietta, after its passing ; and
that this was so erroneous as to make void those
sales; such a decision would reach, as has before
been observed, two valuable interests, bonafide acquired as ours wasi and long possessed as ours ought
to have been: for their titles cannot, and ought not,
to be preserved by the mere refusal of executive
officers to act; neither, it is conceived, because the
land cannot now be entered in tracts of the same
size in which they were offered at public sale, by
reason, that the law is modified in this respect; for,
should this be admitted, the land officers might,
through ignorance, or fraud, entangle titles to any
extent. dll lands, in fact, unsold at public sale are
liable to be entered at private sale; and all tracts

not legally sold are still public lands and liable to be
Sentered.

The observations of Sir William Jones, before
quoted, go to illustrate and support our reasoning on
this point. It may readily be supposed, that a difference might take place in construing the minor
provisions of a statute, though all should agree in
its main object and intent: when this is attained, the
minor provisions are of little moment.-Suppose tho
act of March 3, 1803, was actually couched in such
-ambiguous terms as, taken in their literal and grammatical sense, wofild raise a doubt whether sales
were to continue at Marietta after its passage ; but
that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consequence of
a construction formed from the exercise of his judgment, on a view of the whole law, had given actual
'instructions to continue them there. Would a sale
made under such circumstances be declared void?
-We think not; and certainly not in the present
case, which stands clear of every literal and gram,
matical ambiguity-where the necessarily implied
,construction of the secretary of the treasury runs
with the obvious intendment of the whole law.
In closing our argument on this point, We beg
leave to press this view of the subject with some
earnestness on the consideration of the Court;' and
confidently taking it for granted, that the not instructing the Marietta officers at all was equivalent
to instructions to continue sales there, we again ask,
that if actual instructions had beezz,given, to continue
sales at Marietta, until a few days before they cornmenced at Zanesville, giving sufficient time only,.

OF THE UNITED STATES.

for the proper notice to the Zanesville officers; and
the Register of .the Zanesville district had thought
proper to disregard these regulations, and sell the
land over again, would the Court sanction his sales?
or, in other words, would it now sanction a sale of
the two tracts entered at Marietta, in July, 1803 ?
3. Our third point is, that supposing the act of
March 3,.1803, had, in express words, or by necessary implktion, taken away the power of the Marietta office to sell; yet, that it did not begin to have
that effect, until duly promulgated at Marietta, conformably to the usual manner of promulgating such
acts, &c., and the same of the act of the 226th of
March, 1.804,.
The reason of the rule, that, where no day is appointed, statutes begin to have effect from the day of
their passage, seems to be this: that it being practically impossible actually to notify every person in
the community of the passage of a law, whatever
day might be appointed for its taking effect, no general rule could be adopted less exceptionable. The
general rule may, in some instances, produce injustice; but if ignorance of the law was admitted as
an excuse, too wide a door would be left open for
the breach of it. Where statutes are liable to produce injustice by taking immediate effect, the legislature will, except through inadvertence, appoint a
future day from whence they are to be in force. Mlr.

them public, says, " all laws, should, therefore, be
made to commence in future, and be notified before
their commencement, which is implied in the term
prescribed." The fair inference from this, and, indeed, from all that he and other writers have said,
in treating on the elementary principles of law, is,
that where unjust consequences result from the application of a general rule to a particular case, courts
have the power to except such case and bring it tinder
the control of equitable construction ; and to ask,
" did the law-maker, supposing him to be an upright
man, intend to include or except this case F10
One feature in the reason of the general rule is,
that it would be practically impossible to fix on any
time for laws to take effect so as that each person
affected by them, or liable to be affected, could, with
certainty, have notice; had such notice been practicable, doubtless the rule would have been different;
and where this part of the reason ceases, according to
a maxim of law and reason, so much of the rule ceases
also. Now, when a law, under the supposed form of
that of March 3d, 180 , should be promulgated at
a land office, every person who could in any way be
affected by it, would have actual notice; the'applicant would know that he could not purchase, and he
could not complainof injury. Lord Kaimes' reasoningb goes to show, that where the claims of equity
can be brought under a general rule, "a Court of

equity declines not to interfere.::* Promulgation of
the law at each land office is an easy rule, liable to
no uncertainty or difficulty, and, besides, had been
the usual practice; therefore, no general promulgation can be a substitute for it. The necessity for
the usage is manifest; for, if the numerous depeadents of the Treasury Department were permitted to
construe the law for themselves, endless contradiction and confusion must be the consequence. The
settled-course of decision, in relation to deeds which
have not been put on record within the time prescribed by law, falls exactly into Lord Kaimes' reasoning. Where it can be proved that the party who
holds the second deed, though first on record, had
notice of the previous deed, he shall not be permitted
to take advantage of the omission to record in the
holder of the first deed,
There is a. case in Dallasb precisely in point, to
support the restriction we contend for on the abstract
taking effect of statutes, when the nature of the case
affords reason for such restriction. The laws of the
Colonial Legislature of Pennsylvania were in force
until revoked by the King and Council, and the question was, whether a revocation took effect at its date
in London, or when notified in Philadelphia; and
it was held by the Co.urt, not until notified to the

The double duties were a burden which the whole
community ought, in justice, to bear equally; and
without making the act take a proper and absolute,
effect from the day of its passage, this equality of
imposition would not be produced; an importation
at Washington would have been charged with an
impost from Which one at a more distant port would
have been exempt. Had the act been for reducing
the import duty, no'doubt but the money received at
a distance, after'the passing of the act, would have
been refunded ; this, it is believed, was done on the
repeal of the internal taxes ; and thus a general reciprocity is produced in the operation of laws of this
nature. In this case there was no particular injury
set up, but the hypothetical possibility only of injury, and that, not such as would, necessarily, follow
the act of importation, but growing out of contracts
involved in, and properly referrible to, the general
risk of trade. Had the question been, an entire suspension of the existing right to import, without the
usual equitable provisions on- like occasions, allowing all vessels which had departed without knowledge of such suspension, to complete their voyages,
or with penalties for importation, we may well sulipose the taking effect of the law would have been
restrained to its due notification at the proper office:

OF THE UNITED STATES.

or, to show the same principle in another .point of
view, it may be asked whether the penalties of the
embargo laws attach before notice of their passage
at the naval offices in the respective districts ?
The constitution of the United States has not, in
express words, prohibited Congess from passing laws
impairing the obligation of contracts; but the prohibition is so strongly implied, and such laws, as well
as expost facto laws, are so contrary to justice, that
it is presumed an act to that effect would be declared void: such a law, for instance, as should go to resell any tract of land which had been legally sold.
That the entry of a tract of public lands forms a
perfect contract will not be denied; neither, that under the. supposed form of the act of March 3, 1803,
an entry at Marietta, before it was possible that notice
could reach there, would come fully withing the spirit and meaning of an equitable contract. Now, the
established course in the administration of justice,
protects equitable contracts equally with those which
are strictly legal. The operation of a criminal or
penal law, under the construction contended for on
the other side, would render it, in its practical effects,
as perfectly ex post facto, as one made to take effect
before its passage; and by parity of reasoning, that
construction virtually implies a breach of contract,
and so is contrary to the constitution of the United
States, as well as contrary to reason and justice.
The pardoning power of the executive in a criminal
case, might afford a remedy for the injustice which
would follow; but in a civil one, the only remedy
mhst be found'in the reasonable and equitable con-

and convenience to the

best and truest uses. a

But it may'be said that the general promulgation
of all laws, in this country, is sufficient notice ; and
that from the passage of th act of March 3d, until
the plaintiff's entry, or even application in February,
there was ample room for notice. It is true, that iu
this country all laws have a general promulgation;
but it is equally true, that many laws are, notwithstanding, strictly local: such is the act in question,
and considering the established usage, and the reason for that usage, the Register of the Marietta District cannot .be supposed to be bound to have acquired a knowledge of the act in the general way.
A striking analogy exists between the land laws
and those for the collection of duties on impor.tations.
The two leading points in the public policy are the
same in both, that is, national strength and prosperity, and revenue ; and however deeply laid in the nature of political society the right to carry on trade
and commerce may be, we have, it is conceived, sufficiently shown that the right to settle and improvo
neW land enters as deeply into the nature of political
society in this country ; and has, too, all the force of
prescription of which the right is susceptible. "The
government, acting for the people, have no more
claim to the price of the public lands, than to a part
of the price of merchandize imported, and therefore
have no more exclusive and arbitrary control over

the former than the latter; and, repeating what has
been before mentioned, an attempt to suppress the
settlement of new lands would be as sensibly felt by
the community at large, as an attempt to suppress
trade and commerce: at the same time, both require
to be regulated by law. Now, suppose some newly
acquired territory were to be brought within the operation of the revenue laws, and, for this purpose, it
should be found expedient to annex it to a part of a
former district, making a new district, and that preparatory measures were necessary before the new
district could be organized, and that acts should be
passed with analogous provisions to those found in
the laws in question; would they be construed to
suspend the collection of duties in, and the right to
import into, the old district ?
We have before mentioned, that the case of Wilson v. Masona was cited at the first trial in the Supreme Court of Ohio, to show that notice of an illegal act was void; a position which, we also mentioned, was not disputed : but that case, and the opinion
of the Court in itsuggests some considerations for
direct and hypothetical illustration, which we beg
leave to introduce. In the opinion it is said, "But
if this opinion should be too strict, if an act entirely
equivalent to an entry could be received as a substitute for one, a survey does not appear to be such an
act," &c.-and then the opinion goes on to show the
reason why ; hat is, that the entry is the necessary
notice of the appropriation of any part of the waste
landsi and the only way to prevent others, with equal

rights, from being misled and injured ; that the entry
was, i, fact, the very remedy the law had provided
against a previously existing evil. Now, in the present case, supposing suspension of sales at Marietta
some how entered into the general provisions of the
law-an entry at Marietta would be an 11 entire equivalent" to an entry at Zanesville ; for it is clear, that
before sales could begin at Zanesville, notice must be
given what tracts had been sold at Marietta. This
too, would have been a general notice; general, at any
rate, to the extent of the object; not an individual
notice merely, which the Court would not, in the case
of Wilson v. Mason, suffer to take place of the. general rule.
A case may readily be supposed, under the land
laws of the United States, offering arguments and
objections parallel to those in the case of Wilson v.
Mason. Suppose A. purchases in one district land
lying in another ; discovering his mistake, and that
B. is about to enter the same land in its proper district, he gives notice of his previous entry : here A.
might say, that as between him and the public, a purchase in one district was the same as in another, and
that B. had notice. In such case a court would
doubtless say, that to permit entries in one district,
of land lying in another, would create confusion ;
that a person with equal rights would never know
when he made a safe entry, and that a particular exception, notwithstanding personal notice, was inadmissible; but, as just shown, the objection would not
lie in the present case; so that whatever the " if;" in
the opinion of the Court amounts to, may fairly be
placed to our side of the question.

OF THE UNITED STATES.

. But the point we propose to illustrate principally,

187
1822.

by the case of Wilson v. Mason, is the rightto pur-

chase, by considering that case hypothetically. The
right of every individual -holding a warrant to appropriate to himself waste lands, was not more substantially, or forcibly given, by the laws of Virginia,
than the right to purchase any vacant tract of the
United States land is given, by the act of May 10,
1800. It is true, that in Virginia, money was advanced on obtaining the warrant, but no priority of
claim grew out of the prior date of the warrant, except, in the instance of an accidental competition;
and having money to pay, and applying to enter,
puts the applicant under the laws of the United
States on as good ground in law and equity as he
stood Ion who came forward to enter under the laws
of Virginia. Besides, by a provision in the act of
May 10th, before noticed, money may be paid to the
Treasurer of the United States : this corroborates
and strengthens our reasons for this equality of right.
The right to appropriate extended also ;ver the
whole of the waste lands in the state, though the act
of appropriation must be performed in some one
county. Now, let it be supposed that the question
had been between Wilson and Mason, whether Mason's right to enter, in such county as he thought proper, was to be suspended for fifteen months, in con-sequence of similar legislative provisions to those
found in the acts of March -, 1803,and March 26, 1804,
and with constructions and doings of the proper exedutive officirs, parallel to those in the present case;
can it for -a moment be imagined, that the better
right would have been decreed to Wilson ?

Mr. Hammond, for the respondents. The first
point made for the respondents, is, that this Court
has no jurisdiction.
The alleged contract and fraud of Zane constitute the sole ground for the interference of a Court
of Equity. They are the gist of the plaintiff's case,
and in respect to these, this Court has no supervising control over the State Court. Whether the
contract alleged was one, the obligation of which

Zane.
was such, that a Court of Equity would relieve
against it; and whether making general propositions
of compromise, and delaying more than ten years
before a tender of money was made, and a performance specifically required was such diligence, on the
part of the plaintiff; as to entitle him to the aid of a
Court of Equity, are all questions over which the
State Court has- complete control. In a Court of
Equity the right of the plaintiff to the relief sought
depends upon the decision of the questions here enumerated, and not upon the correct construction of the
acts of Congress.
Let it-be conceded, that the plaintiff's construction of the acts of Congress is correct, and the consequence is, that at the time of the sale at Zanesville, he held a legal right, imperfect to be sure, but
purely legal in its character. The allegations iq the
bill show that the plaintiff lost this right by the
misconception, or misconduct of the Secretary of
the Treasury, and the officers of the land office at
Marietta, and not in consequence of the alleged
agreement with Zane. If the plaintiff had a right,
and that right had been duly regarded by the public
officers, neither the alleged contract with Zane, nor
Zane's subsequent purchase could have impaired it.
Upon what principle, then, does he come in equity
to set up that right against Zane and M'Intire ? Is
it under colour of an agreement with Zane to impeach-the conduct of the Secretary or Register, and

Receiver ? Can it be said that a decision against tho
relief sought, in such a case, is a decision against a
right or title claimed inder an act of Congress ? Is
it not a more rational inference that the
decision
was against the party upon the ground that the contract did not entitle him; or upon the ground that
he could not have relief in equity ? or -that if eniitled
to redress, it must be against the officer. for damages, upon the principle suggested by this Court ?1
Suppose that this Court, upon an examination of
the, case, shall adopt the plaintiff's construction of
the different acts of Congress, does it follow that
they must, or can reverse this decree ? Can they do
it, without examining the obligation and extent of
the alleged agreement with Zane? Can they do it
without inquiring into the subsequent conduct of
Matthews, and determining how far the whole case
entitles the party to the aid of a Court of Equity ?
It seems to us that they cannot. And we insist that
in this Court these inquiries cannot be made: the
25th section of the judiciary act expressly forbids it.
Again; upon the construction of the acts of Congress insisted on by the plaintiff, the certificate of
purchase granted to him by the Register of the land
office at Marietta, on the 16th of May, 1804, vested
in him a legal right to the possession of the lands in
dispute. Such certificates have always been received in Ohio as evidence of title in. ejectment.The bill shows no reason why this legal remedy
was not pursued. If the party by his own laches

of Equity for relief? Does the bill show any circumstance that prevented him from diligently purit was
suing his legal remedy, or does it allege that

Court examine these allegations, or determine whether upon this ground the bill was, or. was not, properly dismissed ?
But last of all, the case made in the bill shows,
that this is the same case, and between the same
,parties, decided by this Court, in 1809.b That was
an ejectment; the facts were agreed ; the pointsubmitted for decision was, the true c-onstruction. of the
acts of Congress referred to, and the decision was
against the plaintiff's purchase. If the true construe.lion of the acts of Congress constitutes the essential
poiattto be decided in this bill, then it must be considered as a Bill in Chancery brought in .th State
Courts, to review the decision of this Court in ejectment. Can it be maintained that to dismiss such a
bill is to decide against a right or title set up under
an act of Congress ?-We-conceive that upon an examination of this record, it will be found immaterial
whether the acts of Congress separate.ly, or the alleged agreement and conduct of Zane separately, or
whether these conjointly, combined with the other
circumstances of the case, constitute its material
points ; the general dismissal of the bill makes no
case upon which the jurisdiction of this Court can
be made to operate.

Zane.

Zane.

The act of May, 1800, which originated and settled the present plan of selling the public lands, directed that lands, within certain specific boundaries,
should be sold at land offices established at certain
places. The uniform understanding and construction of this law has been, that the power to sell at
each of the Land- Offices was confined to the lands
directed by law to be sold there. The officers at
Chillicothe could not sell lands below the Little
Miami, nor lands in the seven ranges. They had
no power to effect such sale, and no right could be
acquired by a purchase so made.
A new, and fifth land office was established at
Zanesville, by the 6th section of the act of March,
1803*; and it was directed that the lands within the
11 th range, and east of it wituin the military tract,
and all the lands north of the Ohio Company's purchase, west of the seven first ranges and east of the
district of Chillicothe, should be sold at Zanesville.
The act containing this provision consists of eight
sections. The first three are intended finally to make
provision for settling claims for military bounties.The fourth authorizes warrants to be issued to General La Fayette. The fifth provides fbr surveying
the unappropriated lands within the military tract,
and directs that so much of these lands as lie west of
the 1Ith range shall be made part of the district of
Chillicothe, and shall be sold there,, "under the same

193

OF THE UNITED STATES.

-regulations that other lands are within the said district." The sixth section creates the new district
at Zanesville, including a large body of lands within
the military tract, and a large body, also, of the lands
before that time directed to be sold at Marietta.The seventh section gives longer time to the purchasers of lands within J. C. Symmes' purchase to complete their payments: and the eighth section relates
to warrants, and platts and certificates of survey,
within the Virginia military tract. This act was
approved the 3d of March, 1803. No time is fixed
for it to take effect; and hence a question is mooted,
as to the time when the sixth section commenced its
effective operation, so as to put an end to the power
of making sales, at Marietta, of the lands formerly
within the Marietta District, but directed by the 6th
section to be sold at Zanesville.
It is not pretended but that the act in question, for
all its general objects, took effect from its passage.
There is nothing in its terms to except the 6th section from the general operation. The other seven
sections speak from their passage, from the general
taking effect of the act. The 6th section says the
lands "shall be offered fot sale at Zanesville."
When? From this time; for no other time is designated. And it is a settled maxim, that where no
time is appointed, by thd act itself, for it to take
effect, its operation commences from its passage. We
have nothing to do with cases that may be supposed,
of acts committed or rights commenced before the
passage of a law that affects them was, or could be
known. All such cases stand-Upon their own circumVOL. VII.

stances, and are exceptions to the general rule.

The

V.
Zane.

Zanesville, and as no time is appointed for commencing the sales there, the act, in the natural import of
its terms, according to settled rules of construction,
must be understood to direct the sales to commence
immediately, and by necessary .consequence, annuls
the power to sell the same lands at Marietta, that
existed before the act was passed, from the same
period, of time. Such' being the plain import of the
words used, when interpreted. by a standard maxim
of interpretation, those who undertake to render the
6th section inoperative for an indefinite time, by connecting it with the preceding laws, and with other
circumstances, take upon themselves the burthen of
proof, and are bound to, make but their case. It is
not maintained by any one, that lands within the
Zanesville District could be sold at Marietta, after
the taking effect of a legal provision, directing them
to be sold at Zanesville. The true point in dispute
then, isthis : When did this 6th section take effect ?
The proposition of the plaintiff, if I have been able
to comprehend it, seems to be something like this:
The 6th section of the act of March 3d, 1803, ought
not to be construed as containing any determinate,
positive operative provision; but should be regarded
as merely provisional, or inchoative, dependent upon
some future act of legislation to give it force and effect. To sustain this position, various arguments
are urged, all of which appear to be predicated
upon three principles:
First. A construction which would withdraw any

OF THE UNITED STATES.

part of the public lands from market is against the
public policy.
Second. It is against the right of every individual
to purchase,
Third. It is inconsistent with the practical construction given by the Secretary of the Treasury.
If the truth of every one of these dogmas were admitted, it would seem a sufficient reply, that the positive provisions of positive law never can be made
to yield to any such considerations. When determining upon the construction to be given to an ambiguous provision, they ought to have their influence.
But they cannot be legitimately used, first to render a plain provision ambiguous, and then to determine its meaning.
The sixth section, as I have already insisted,
stands clear of any ambiguity, and to decide that it
takes effect from its passage, does not necessarily
determine that, its operation must be to withdraw
any part of the public lands from market.
So far from being merely inchoative, the sixth
section was capable of being carried into immediate
practical effect, according to its terms. The officers
might have been immediately appointed and furnished with. platts and surveys of the unsold lands within
the lands taken from the Marietta District; sales
might have commenced immediately, and so soon as
the military lands were surveyed, they, too, might
have been brought into market. Certainly it cannot
be contended, but that the lands within the military
tract, attached to the Chillicothe District, by the fifth
section, might have been brought into market as soon

as surveyed, without any additional legislative provision. The plaintiff is, therefore, totally mistaken, as to the legitimate consequence of giving to
the 6th section an immediate operative effect. Such
construction tends to bring the public lands into
market, not to shut them out. That the officers were
not, in fact, appointed, and that the sales did not commence, are matters that have no bearing upon the
argument. The true meaning of a statute must be
determined by an examination of its provisions ; 'not
by the conduct of those appointed to carry it into execution. This view of the subject is also a satisfactory answer to the allegation respecting the rights of
individuals to purchase. If that right exists, in the
extent contended for, it could not be impaired by
giving the 6th section immediate effect. So far as
it was affected, it was by circumstances of a character very different from giving to the law a correct
construction.
But the principles assumd, both with respect to
the public policy, and the individual right to purchase, are not admitted to be correct. Of the public
policy the legislature are exclusively the judges, and
the individual right to purchase is also, before its actual application to any particular tract, entirely subject to legislative regulation. Now, I can well conceive, that it might be deemed good policy to withdraw, for a time, a portion of the public lands from
the market. And if the legislature should do so, it
is conceived that their act would be, at once, decisive
of thepublic policy of the measure, and, so far, must
absolutely control the individual right to purchase.

OF THE UNITED STATES.

If, then, the just construction of the 6th section should
have the effect alleged, of withdrawing from the
market a portion of the public lands, that circumstance would furnish no ground whatever upon
which a court of justice should, or could, properly
interpolate a fanciful construction of their own.
They could not rightfully assume a course of policy
different from that prescribed- in the law, and make
their own imaginations a standard of construction.
In fact, it was a part of the public policy, until
long after 1803, to withhold- a portion of the public
lands from market. The three sections in each
Township reserved for future disposition, was kept
back by this policy, and sold at a much higher price
in consequence of it,
when actually offered for sale.
Can it be pretended, that any citizen had a right to
purchase these reserves, until their sale was authorized. by law, and the terms of the purchase defined ?
We are required to examine whether the Zanesville
District is erected, established, or settled by that section. We'maintain that the Zanesville District was
fully and completely established by the 6th -section.
If it was not, it is not yet established. It is recognized
as an existing district by subsequent acts : but is, in
no other way, authorized or established. It could
not be essential to the existence of 'the district, that
a time.for commencing sales should be fixed, or that
the Register and Receiver should be appointed. 'Indeed, until the district was established, no such appointment could be made. The perplexity in which
the plaintiff involves his own propositions : at one
time considering the section as designating the

limits of a new district; at another, regarding it as
providing that a new district should be erected,

at some time indefinitely future; and again declaring
it inchoate and inoperative; telling us, in one breath,
that some subsequent legislative provision is required,
fixing the time when it should be established and in
the next, fixing that time upon a speculation of his
own, without any such legislative act, is, of itself,
very strong evidence that he is in error. The terms
of the statute are simple and unambiguous. All this
glossing is not required to find out their obvious import. It is not an effort to elucidate, but to establish
an hypothesis.
For the defendants, it is contended, that from the
passage of the ac of March 3d, 1803, the Zanesville
District was est- olished, and the power to sell at Marietta- determined. We have shown that this construction involves none of the inconveniences suggested by the plaintiff; but that if they actually existed, it resulted not from the provisions of the law ;
but from other causes. Our interpretation is founded upon a plain, palpable, and consistent doctrine, in
every respect definite and certain. Its only possible evil, a suspension, for a short period, of the sales
of a small portion of the public land. The construction insisted upon by the complainant is desiitute of
all certainty, and calculated to involve the Whole
subject in perplexity and doubt. There is a district,
the lands within which must be sold at Zanesville,
Was it established by the 6th section of the act of
3d March, 1803? No, says the opposite argrument,
that section only defined the limits to enable the Sur-

OF THE UNITED STATES.'

veyor General t6 prepare the platts and surveys. No,
says the opposite argument again,- that act was
only inchoative and inoperative, it provided that the
Zanesville District shouldbe erected at some time indefinitely future. Was it established by the act of the
26th of March, 1804, appointing the time of the commencement of the, public sales ? No, again, says the
opposite argument, that act "in relation to the present question, only fixes the future- time when it
shall be established." Was it established by. the appointment of the officers? No, says the complainant,
the new district 'was not established and settled by
appointing the officers. And this negative involves
the very singular circumstance, that officers should
be appointed for a district not established and settled.
By the strict terms of the law, the complainant insists that the Zanesville District was not erected,
legally established, and settled until the 19th of May,
the Saturday before the sales commenced on the
Monday, 21st, following. But by a reasonable construction, he concedes that the Zanesville District
might be considered as established and settled after
the 12th of May. At what time after, and before the
19th, he ha's not informed us, and, no doubt, foi this
very good reason, that after he made his entry, on
the 12th of May, he had no interest in the question.
We have the voluminous bill and the elaborate argument of the complainant before us, ao they show
how the Zanesville District was established, and
whei it was established ? There are, undoubtedly,
a multiplicity of allegations, to show that it was not
established until after the 12th of May, but all the

rest is left in obscurity. We have not been able to
perceive one single sound reason for' considering the
12th of May an era of any importance, except that it
was the day upon which the plaintiff made his entry.
Ought a court of justice thus to depart from the direct and plain import of unequivocal terms.

Another point laboured in the bill, and strongly
urged in argument, is, that the whole conduct of theSecretary of the Treasury, as superintendant of
the sales of public lands, was in accordance with the
hypothesis maintained by the complainant. The act
in question, March 3d, 1803, was never specially
promulgated at the Marietta offices. No instructions
with respect to it were ever sent to the officers ; and
sales made at Marietta within the tract directed to be
sold at Zanesville, after the passage of the act were
confirmed by the Secretary.
One general observation must be made with respect to all these allegations. The Secretary wits
the agent of the law, and was subject to its provisions, which he could neither restrain nor extend.-If
he fell into error, that error can iavail nothing in a
court of justice, bound to declare their own interprenot to adopt that of others.

We think
we have shown that the three principal
propositions opon which the plaintiff rests his construction of the act of 3d March, 1803, are equally unfounded in fact, and untenable in ar.:ument;
our interpretation of that act is not shaken by them:

that this is the old question, in a new dress. -The
power to sell at Marietta was created by the act of

to sell at Zanesville, given by the act of March, 1803,
is a complete, not an inchoative power. Although
no time is fixed at which that power shall be execiited, yet the power itself is created, and if it exist,
then it is repugnant to the previous power, given to
sell at Marietta, and repeals that power. It is impossible that the Court cannot at once perceive the
distinction between creating the power to sell, and
providing for the immediate execution of that power.
It is because the complainant has not regarded the
distinctive character of these two circumstances, that
he has involved his argument in so much perplexity.
And here, if it were essential to the argument, it
might be shown, that should it be conceded that
Congress did not intend to suspend the sal. s, and
that such is the effect of our construction, yet it reVoL. VIU

sults from the .force of the terms used, contrary to
the intention. They created a complete and perfect
power to sell at Zanesville,* and omitted to provido,
that the legal effect of-that power should be
suspended, until measures were arranged for its immediate
execution. So that the question still recurs, when
was the power to sell at Zanesville, under the act
of March, 1803, actually created ? If, as we contend, that power existed the moment the act took
effect, it was from that moment repugnant to the
power of making sales of the same lands at Marietta.
The two acts are, in no single view, affirmative of
each other on' this point, although they both relate
to.the sales of public lands. The legal power to
sell at Zanesville must have existedi, separately and
substantively, before any measure could be taken to
carry that power, into effect. This consideration
alone exposes the fallacy of connecting the power to
sell, the appointment of the-.officers, and the conmencement of the sales, as all essential io the erection
of the district.
Mr.*Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinior of the Court.
his suit was brought in the State Court of Ohio
for the purpose of obtaining a conveyance of a tract
of land to which the complainant supposed himself
to have the equitable title, founded, on an entry prior
to that on which a grant had been issued to the defendants. The State Court decreed that the bill
should be dismissed, and that decree is now before
'.

OF THt.UNITED STATES0

this Court, on the allegation that the'Court of the
State has misconstrued an act ot Congress.

The plaintiff has stated several equitable circumstances in aid of the title given by his entry; but
unless his entry be in itself valid, there can have
been no misconstruction of an act of Congress in
dismissing the bill, and this Court cannot take into
consideration any. distinct equity arising out of the
contracts alid transactions of the parties, and creating
a new and independent title.
- The validity of the plaintiff's entry depends on
the land laws of the 1nited States.
In May, 1800, Congress passed -an act dividing
an extensive territory northwest of the river Ohio,
into four districts ;, and establishing a land office in
each, for the sale of the public lands within that district. This act prescribes the time, place, and manner, in which the lands of each district shall be offered at public sale; and directs, also, the manner
and terms in which those not sold at public sale may
be disposed of at private sale. The lands of the
district comprehending the tract in controversy were
to be offered for public sale at Marietta, 'on the last
Monday of May, 1801.
On the 3d of March, 1803, Congress passed an
act, the 6th section of which creates a fifth district,
and enacts that the lands contained within it "shall
be offered for sale at Zanesville under the direction
of a Register of the land office and Receiver of public
moneys, to be appointed for that purpose, who shall
reside at that place."
This district includes the land in controversy.

Zane.

On the 26th of March, 1804, Congress passed an
act entitled, " an act making provision for the disposal of the public lands in the Indiana territory, and
for other purposes.")
This act comprehends the lands directed to be
sold under the act of 1806, and 1803, as well as the
lands in Indiana.
The 5th section enacts, that ," all the lands aforesaid," (except certain enumerated tracts, of which
the land in controversy forms no part,) " be offered
for sale to the highest bidder, under the direction of
the Surveyor General, or Governor of the Indiana
Territory, of the Register of the land office, and of
the Receiver of public moneys at the places respectively where the land offices are kept, and on such
day or days as shall, by a public proclamation of the
President of the United States, be designated for
that purpose."
On the 7th of February, 1804, Matthews applied
to the Register of the Marietta District, and communicated to him his desire to purchase the land in controversy. The office ofReceiver being then vacant,
no money was paid, and no entry was made; but
the Register took a note or memorandum of the application.
The counsel for the plaintiff insists, that the title
of his client commences with this application.
The law authorizes the respective Registers to sell
at private sale all the lands which may remain unsold at the public sales, and says the sales " shall be
made in the following manner, and nder the following conditions, to wit:

OF THE UNITED STATES.

. " At the time of purchase, every purchhser
shall, exclusively of the fees hereafter mentioned,
pay six dollars for every section, and three dollars
for every half section he may have purchased, for
surveying expenses; and deposit one-twentieth part
of the amount of purchase money, to be forfeited if
within foTty days one fourth part of the purchase
money, including the said twentieth part, is not
paid.
The payment of the money required by the act
is obviously indispensable to the purchase. Without
such payment, the sale prescribed by law could not
be made ; and certainly no sale, had the Register attempted to make one, could be valid if made in opposition to the law. But the Register has not attempted to sell, nor could- Mr. Matthews have so
understood the transaction. He took a note of die
land the plaintiff intended to purchase; and, had the
receipt of the Receiver been produced, might, perhaps, have made the entry. In so doing he would
have acted in the double character of Register, and
agent of the liurchaser.
That there was no Receiver was undoubtedly not
the fault of Mr. Matthews; but this circumstance as
completely suspended the power of selling land in
the Marietta District as if there had been neither
Register nor Receiver ; as if there had been no land
office.
The trausactions then between Mr. Matthews and
the Register on the 9th of February; 1804, may be
put entirely out of the case.

ceiver had entered on the duties of his office, Matthews paid the sum 6f money required by law, and
made an entry for the land in controversy with the
Register of the Marietta District.

The 12th section of the act of the 26th of March,
1(04. directed that "1the lands in the District of
Zanesville should be offered for public sale on the
thirdMonday of May."
In pursuance of this act, and of instructions from
the Secretary of the Treasury, the sale of the lands
in the. District did commence on that day; and, on
the 26th day of that month, the defendants became
the purchasers of, the lind in controversy.
This Court conThere are many charges of fraud in the bill. and

title set up under the act of C
cannot look into those
circumstances, unless

they. had induced the Court of Ohio to determine
against the person having the title under the laws of
the United States. As this case stands, the opinion
of the State Court on the fraud and the contract, is'
conclusive ; and the only question to be discussed
here is, the title of the plaintiff under the acts of
Congress." This depends entirely on the validity of
his-entry made on the 12th of May, 1804.

the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction,bot4 as to

the Congress shaU make."
The judiciary act of 1789, c. 20. s. 25. provides, "that a
fisial judgment, or decree, in any suit, in the highest Court of
Law or Equity of a State, in which a decision of the suit could
be had, where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty
or statute Of, or an authority -exercised under, the'UnigedSates,
and the decision is against their validity," &c.; "or where is
drawn in question the construction of any clause of the constitution, or of a treaty, or statute oJ, or commission held-under,
the United States, and the decision is against the title, right,privilege, or exception, specially set up by either party, under such
clause of the sai4 Constitution, treaty, statute, or commission,
niay be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme
Court of the United States, upon a writ of error," &c. "But
no other errorshall be assigned or regarded as a ground of reversal, in any such case as aforesaid, than such as appearson
theface oj the record, and immediately respects the beforementioned questions of validity or construction of the said comtitution,
treaties, statutes, commissions,'or authorities, in dispute."
Under these 'provisions, with a view to the questions of
jurisdiction in the above case, (Matthews v. Zane and others,)
the following points -have been determined by this Court. In
an action of ejectment between two citizens of the same State,
in the State Court, for fainds within the State, if the defendant
sets up an outstanding title in a British subject, which he contends is protected by the 9th art. of the treaty of 1794. between .the United States and Great Britaino, and that therefore,
the title is out of the plaintiff; and the highest Court 'of Law
or Equity of the State decides against the title thus set up, it
is not a case in which a writ of error lies to this Court. The
words of the judiciary act must be restrained by the, constitu-

tion, which extends the judicial power to all cases arising uuder treaties made by authority of the United States. This is
not a case arising under the British treaty; and whether an

outstanding title be-an obstacle to the plaintiff's recovery is a
question exolesively for the decision of the State tribunal.
But it,must be understood that4his Court has appellate juris-!
diction where the treaty is drawn in question, whether incdentally or directly. Whenever a right grows out of, or is protected by a treaty made under the' authority of the United
States, it is sanctioned against all the laws and judicial decisions
of the respective States ; and whoever may have this right
under such treaty, is to be pl'tected. Thus, if the British
subjecti in whom was supposed to have bebn vested the outstanding title protected by the treaty, or his heirs, had claimed
in the cause, it would have been a case arising under the
treaty. But as neither his title, nor that of any person claiming under him, could be altected by, the decision, it was held
not to be a case arising tinder a treaty. Owings v. Norwood,
5 Cranch, 344. But, where the decision- is against the validity
of the treaty, or against the title, specially set, up by either
party to the cause, under the treaty; this Court has jurisdiction,
to ascertain that title, and determine its legal validity, and is
not confined to the mere abstract construction of the treaty
itself. Smith v. The State of Maryland, 6 Cranch, 286. Martin v. Hunter, ante, vol. L p. 304. 357. The last clause in

the 25th section of the judiciary act, which restricts the
grounds of reversal to such as appear on the face of the, record,

and immediately respect the construction of the treaty or statute
.in dispute, applies only to cases where the parties claim under
various titles, and assert various defences, some of which may
and others may not regard the construction of a treaty or

material circumstances which are
9• now disclosed, did b~
not appear in that case. But the Court is of api- rtnedca .
nion, that the additional circumstances relied on in
argument can, in no degree, affect the point decided
in that case, which was, that the power of selling at
Marietta ceased when the new district was estabished, so far as respected the land in that district.
This point has been re-argued with great labour
and talent, and has been re-considered by the Court.
The result of that re-consideration is, that the original opinion is correct. We still think, that on the
passage of the act by which the District of Zanesville was created, and the land within it directed to
be sold at that place, the power of selling the same
land at Marietta necessarily ceased.
It is, we think, impossible to look at these acts
without perceiving that the lands lying in one district could not be sold in any other. Their words
and their policy equally forbid it. The land in controversy might have been sold at Marietta by the
Register and Receiver of that place, previous to the
statute, and was intended to limit what would otherwise unquestionably have attached to this Court, the right of revising
all4he points in dispute, and to confine it to such errors as respect the. questions specified in the section. Alartin v. Hunter,

3d of March, 1803, because it 'lay in the districty
the lands of which were directed by law to be st)ld
at that place by those officers. Had the land been
out of that District, it could never have been sold
at that place, or by those officers. When, by law, a
new district was formed, comprehqnding this land,
and its sale'was directed at a different place, and bydifferent persons, the land is placed as entirely with.!
out the District of Marietta, as if it had never been
withinit. The power of the officers of the land
office at Marietta to sell, is expressly limited to the
lands within the district; and land which ceases to
be within the district, is instantly, withdrawn from
that power.
That the effect of this construction is to suspend
the sales of land in the pnew district until the proper
officers should be appointed,. does not, we think, operate against it. An immense quantity of land was
in the market ; and the laws furnish no evidence in
support of the opinion, that the eagerness to keep
the whole continually within the reach of every purchaser, was so great as to hazard the confusion which
might arise from any uncertainty respecting the office
at which any portion of it might be acquired. If this
intention had been so predominant, the legislature
would certainly have provided that the lands in the
Zanesville District might still he sold at Marietta
until some day to be fixed in the lai by.which it
might be supposed that the office at Zanesville
would- come into operation. The omission- to make
such a provision forbids the opinion that Congress

those who possess the power of appointment immediately to appoint necessary officers to carry on ihe
sales at.Zanesville, and 'Congress did not think proper to provide for continuing the sales at Marietta
until such officers should be appointed.
This Court, then, retains its opinion, that, independently of the act of the 26th of March, i804,
the entry diade. by.Matthews on the 12th of May,
1804, would be invalid. That opinion is still fur,ther strengthed by the act last mentioned. That
act, considering its 5th" and 12th sections together,
directs all the lands in the Zanesville District to be
sold under the authority of the proper officers on
the third Monday of the ensuing May. Consequently there could be no power to sell, any of the
land within that district at Marietta.
The case of the plaintiff may b6, and probably is,
a-hard one. But to relieve him is not within the
power of this Court.. We think the plaintiff is not
entitled under the laws of the United States to the
land le claims ; and that the decree ought to be
