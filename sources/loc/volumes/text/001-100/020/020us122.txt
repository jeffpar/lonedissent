tion of the bar. It appears to us, therefore, that the
jury ought to have been instructed, that if they were
satisfied, that Joseph's possession was adverse to that
of the other heirs, and under a dlaim of title distinct
from, or paramount to that of' his father, during his
26 years of exclusive possession, the entry of the
purchaser, under the administrator's sale, was not
congeable, and that the power of the creditor over
the estate was extinguished. There was therefore
error in the opinion of the Court to the jury, that as
against the creditors of William Dudley, neither Joseph nor the tenant had gained any title to the land
in controversy by possession.
For these reasons the judgment of the Circuit
Court must be reversed, and the cause remanded,
with directions to the Court to order a venire facias

from the Circuit Court of Ohio.
This suit was brought by the appellants, who were
plaintiffs in the Circuit Court, to obtain a conveyance
for twelve nineteenths of a tract of land lying
in the state of Ohio, containing 1900 acres, for which
a patent was issued in December, 1814, to the defendants, the heirs of Nathaniel Massie. The other defendants were purchasers from him. The survey
on which the patent was founded was made as to
1200 acres, part thereof on a military land warrant
No. 2675, granted by the Commonwealth of Virginia, to Robert Jouitte for 2666A acres of land, of
which 20514 acres were alleged to have been assigned to Nathaniel Massie by Robert Jouitte. The
plaintiff Alice claimed as heir of Robert Jouitte, and
denied this assignment: on the existence and valididity of which the whole cause depended. The assignment itself could not be produced, and was supposed by the defendants to have been consumed with
the other papers of the war office, in November, 1800.
Under these circumstances, the defendants insisted
that the patent was primafacie evidence that every

satisfactory and legal proof of the assignment was
made; and they relied on the testimony in the cause
as supporting, instead of weakening, this presumption.
The plaintiffs contended that the papers filed in the
Land -Office did not justify the emanation of the patent; and that the absence of the assignment, and of
any proof of its destruction, justified their requiring
from the defendants the most complete proof of its
existence and loss.
The papers on which the patent issued, were a
copy of the original warrant, a copy of the platt and
certificate of survey made in the name of N. Massie,
as. assignee, on the 24th of December, 1796, and recorded in the surveyor's office on the 9th of June,
1797, to which were annexed the following certificate and affidavit: "I do certify that the within survey was made on 1200 acres, part of warrant No.

The testimony of Anderson was taken in the cause
for the purpose of proving the assignment from Jouitte to Massie, and the substance of his evidence will
be found in the opinion of the Court. In confirmation
of his testimony, the defendants also relied on a grant
madeto Massie, on the 2d of January, 1802, on a survey made the first of April, 1797, forMassie, as assignee of part of the same warrant. The entry was made
on the 27th of January, 1795, and the patent contains a recital of the assignment of 205 and - acres,
part of Jouitte's warrant.
A decree, dismissing the plaintiff's bill, was entered by the Circuit Court, pro forma, by consent, and
the cause was brought by appeal to this Court.
Mr. Hammond, for the appellants, argued, that Feb. 21wf.
the defendants stood in the same situation that Massie was at the time he made the sales, and it was
incumbent upon them to prove the assignment of the
warrant to Massie.

In every case, the person claiming as assignee,
must establish his right by proof. If the endorsee
of a promissory note, bill of exchange, or other writing made assignable at law, sue in his own name
upon such note, bill, or writing, he cannot recover
without making proof of the assignment. The person who claims to be the assignee of a warrant or
platt and certificate of survey, until after a patent is
issued to him, cannot assert in his own name,
against third persohs, a right arising under such
warrant or survey without proving his purchase.a If
this is the law where the original owner asserts no
claim, and is no party before the Court, there is
much stronger reason that it should be so when
such original owner is pursuing his right in the
hands of a third person, whose claim he contests. It
has, indeed, been decided, that when a grant once
issues, such grant is prima fade evidence that every
intermediate act necessary to authorize the emanation of the grant has been regularly transacted b But
that was at law, and tlhe Court, in the opinion delivered, plainly intimate, that the fact, whether the
incipient right had actually been assigned, might be
contested in equity. Upon whom the burden of
proof should rest, in such a case, is not' noticed.
But the Kentucky Court of Appeals -has decided,
that where there had been no actual assignment of
the warrant, the owner might recover the lands in

the hands of the pretended assignee, after the grant,
or in the hands of the purchaser with notice.' And
they seem to have required the claimant to adduce
proof that no assignment ever wps made.

In these

cases, the assignment was actu ,il; endorsed upon
the warrant, which it is conceived is a material circumstance.
Warrants for land, and plats and certificates of
survey were not assignable upon the principles of the
common law.

They were subjects of contract, and

might be sold and purchased: but without the aid
of statutory provisions, the purchaser could not
have acquired an absolute legal interest in them.
The first statute of Virginia, that provided for
granting land warrants, and executing surveys,
enacted that 11 all persons, as well foreigners as
others, shall have a right to assign and transfer warrants and certificates of survey for land." To assign
or transfer, that is, to vest in the purchaser an absolute legal title to the warrant or platt and certificate
of survey, can only be done by endorsing such assignment or transfer upon the warrant or platt itself, or
by making it in writing, and attaching such writing
to the document transferred: so that the subject assigned or transferred, and the act of assignment and
transfer shall be inseparable. The owner of a land
warrant may sell it, either by parol or written contract. Such sale would vest in the purchaser an
equitable right to the warrant; a right which a Court
of law would respect, and a Court of equity enforce;

but it would not constitute him the legal owner. It
not operate as an absolute assignment or

transfer of the legal ownership. So the obligee of a
bond, made assignable by law, may dispose of it by,
contract; but if nn assignment be endorsed upon it,
or absolutely attactied fo and connected with it, the
purchaser, it is conceived, could not sustain an action upon it in his own name as assignee. Ile would
be compelled to sue in the name of the original obligee, and upon establishing his purchase, a Court
of law would so far respect it as to preclude the
nominal plaintiff from interfering to control the
suit.
This position is sustained by the subsequent le-,
gislation of Virginia on this subject. Provision was
made by law for returning warrants in part located,
or otherwise, and receiving new warrants in exchange. The propriety of issuing new warrants to
assignees where the name of the original owner was
merely endorsed on an assignment executed without
the attestation of witnesses, was doubted. To provide for this case, the act of the Virginia Assembly
of February, 1809, was enacted. It recites the
provision authorizing the assignment of warrants in
general terms, and that there are "many warrants
outstanding which have been transfeyred, sometimes
by the mere endorsement of the names of the holder,
and at others by assignment without attestation, and
doubts have arisen whether, in such cases, it would
be proper for the register of the land office to grant
to the present holders new warrants, in exchange
for the warrants so transferied and assigned. It

rant hisown affidavit; stating that so far as he knows
or believes, the endorsements or assighments appearing on such warrant have beein made fairly and bona
fide, and that he, or those in w hoge' name or names
such. exchange is sought, is or are the true and -rightful proprietor or proprietors of such warrant." The
act provides that-'this affidavit, with the original warrant, shall be preserved, and that the right of the original owner, or other, to the original- warrant, shall
not be affected by this Droceeding. And it directs,
that thereafter warrants shall only be assigned by
Written-asignment on the back, attested by two or
more witflesses. : It is insisted that ihe framers of
this statute recognised no mode of assignment, to
vest a legal interest, inthe warrant, that existed distinct
and separate from the warrant itself. -They contemplated that in every case the warrant should carry
with it the evidence of ownership. And because in
all transactions with third persons, claiming to be
owners, the evidence might be insufficient or fabricated,' the law requited the preservitioh of the warrant itself, that-with it this evidence might be preserved. Lest by exchanging the warrant this evidence
should be lost, and the relative rights of the- parties
changed, or otherwise affected, the provisions just
recited were enacted.
In'this case, the warrant never was so assigned
or transferred, as to vest a legal interest in Massie,

and it certainly cannot be incumbent upon the complainants to disprove that which does not exist. Had
an assignment of any kind, subscribed with Jouitte's
name, been endorsed upon the warrant, there would
be something to which the complainants could direct
their proof. They might attempt to negative the
fact, that Jouitte had actually subscribed the paper ;
and the actual existence of such endorsement might
b6 considered, at least after the grant issued, as primafacie evidence that it was genuine. But this
presumption cannot be raised, without some foundation for it to rest upon.
Where the assignment is made upon a separate
paper, as is claimed here,.the defendants must establish the existence of this assignment, before it can
avail them any thing. When the existence of such
separate assignment is established, its genuineness
and operative effect are to be examined.
The deposition of Anderson does not sufficiently
prove that any such assignment ever existed. He
evidently testifies, not from any distinct recollection
of the fact, but from a knowledge of what ought to
have existed to justify him in allowing entries in
Massie's name as assignee. His testimony is as to
the general course" of business in the office, from
which he infers that an assignment must have existed. And when the defendants put the question
direct as to the character of the assignment, wheiher endorsed upon the warrant, or made on a separate paper, his answer is not positive as to the fact;
but is clearly an inference from other facts. sc On
a separate piece of paper, I presume, as the entries

OF THE UNITED STATES.

in. the first instance were in Jouitte's name." This
presumption, deduced by the witness from the fact
thatthe warrant was deposited in the office by Jouitte,
unassigned, and various locations-made upon it in the
owwr?s name, is but slender evidence upon which
to establish any fact. The foundation on which
the witness makes this presumption is before the
Court. Can it be said that the inference is of that
irresistible character that amounts to proof? If the
witness were present, his testimony could not be received as competent to-establish the fact that such
paper existed, unless he were able to state, and did
state, that he had such knowledge of Jouitte's handwriting, as, upon well settled principles, would enable
him to testify to it. Nothing is shown in his deposition of his knowledge of Jonitte's haidwriting.
For this reason alone his testimony isinoperative.
Were the existence of the paper clearly established, its contents and effect could not be proved, without first proving its loss. The testimony shows that
this assignment was delivered to Massie. It is thus
traced to his possession. His own affidavit, made
with a view to obtaining the grant for the lands in
question, is wholly silent as to its loss or destruction,
and there is no evidence what has become of it. In
such case it is not competent for the defendants to
prove its contents.
The testimony of Anderson is liable to some exceptions. He is positive that he never made but one
entry without an assignment of the warrant; that
Jouitte's first entries were made by Massie ; that the
assignment was taken out of the office with the platt

and certificate, and that the assignment was first
produced by Massie. He is, with respect to other
facts equally material, unable to recollect. He is
not certain that the assignment was on a separate
paper; does not recollect when it was produced;
its date, or whether attested by subscribing witnesses;
nor is he positive whether it was executed by Jouitte
personally, or by an agent. It is manifest from all
this, that he does not state facts from a distinct recollection of circumstances and transactions; but
from inference only. His official papers show, that
certain facts ought to have existed, and hence he
supposes that they existed, and so testifies.
The certificate of Anderson, on the 10th of May,
1801, that the warrant had been taken out of the
offi.a by mistake on the 14th of June, 1797, is incorrect in point of fact; because, both his subsequent
certificate of the 20th of April, 1802, and his deposition, show, that it was delivered to Massie with
the original platt and certificate of survey to be returned to the war offive, that a patent might issue.
As the warrant was wholly appropriated,,the last
survey upon it being made upon the first of A pril
preceding, it was regular and proper, if not absolutely
necessary, to return the warrant to the war office.
The law required the warrant to he returned to the
office where the patent issued, or a cerificate to be
adduced from the surveyor that a part remained unappropriated in the office, before a grant could issue.
As the warrant was wholly appropriated, this certificate could not he made ; there was, of consequence,
a propriety in returning the original warrant. There

OF THE UNITED STATES.

could be no mistake about it; and this certificate was
found of great practical convenience to Massie, who
was relieved by it from the necessity of returning
the warrant without an assignment, or the warrant
with the assignment, to be preserved as evidence
against him.
The act of Congress, of March 3d, 1803, c. 343,
which provided what evidence should supply the
place of a warrant or certificate lost or'destroyed,
directed that a certified copy of the warrant or platt
and certificate of survey, with satisfactory proof, by
affidavit or otherwise, of the loss or destruction of
the warrant or platt and certificate of survey, should
be sufficient. The warrant never was in 1htet returned. No evidence was ever produced of its loss.
Massie, in his affidavit made in 1806, in conformity
with the provisions of this law, is silent as to the
loss of the warrant, and confines himself to the platt
and certificate of survey. It is by means of this
certificate that the warrant was taken out of the office by mistake that the omission to return the warrant is supplied; although a careful examination of
the whole documents would have shown that this
certificate did by no means account for keeping the
warrant back. It is thus demonstrated from the
documents themselves, that the grant issued to Massie's heirs was upon incompetent and insufficient evidence.
By depositing his warrant with the surveyor, and
procuring it to be located, Jouitte did all he could to
secure his own rights, and to prevent imposition upon
others. The warrant no longer existed a mere float-

ing evidence of a right to land, which circulated
through the country, and upon which any person might
forge an assignment, and thereby deceive and prejudice others. After the location, the warrant was no
longer assignable until withdrawn; and it was by the
unauthorized act of Massie, in withdrawing the warrant, that it was again in a condition to be assigned.
The owner of a warrant, who has thus acted, stands
in a situation different from one who has not thus
been careful. From him and his representatives the
same degree of proof ought not to be required of a forged or unauthorized assignment, as might properly he
exacted from one whose warrant by his own act, or
his own neglect, was thrown afloat into the market.
Indeed, it is deemed doubtful, whether, after the owner had entered the warrant, and thus put an end to
its assignable character, that character could again
be restored by the unauthorized act of another.
Upon the whole, we insist that the evidence does
not make for the defendants even aprima facie case
of assignment; that when its competency and effect
are examined by settled principles of law, it amounts
to nothing : of consequence, there is nothing for the
plaintiffs to disprove. The right of their ancestor is
vested in them, and they must recover.
Mr. Doddrige and Mr. Scott, contra, stated, that
whether the burthen of proof of the assignment be
cast on the respondents, who claim under it, or the
appellants, who deny it, was a question of vast importance to those who hold lands any where under the
laws of Virginia. The cases cited from the Kentucky

OF THE UNITED STATES.

Reports furnish precedents in favour of the respondents, especially as the proofs of the assignments claimed were yet in being, which is not the case here.
It is insisted, on the other side, that the evidence of
the contract of assignment ought to be written on
the warrant, or on some paper attached to it; inseparably attached to it, to use the language of the
counsel.
A warrant for land under the Virginia system may
strictly be termed a chose in action. It is the mere
evidence of executory contract between the State and
a citizen. Bounties - in land had been promised to
the army, by various laws, as a reward for military
services. Where the services were performed, the
relation between the parties was that of debtor and
creditor. It is immaterial whether 'the debt thus created was payable in money, or in land at a particular place, and at a future time. When, by the act
of 1779, warrants for the bounties were created, like
all other evidences of debts due from the State, they
would have been subject to the policy of the common
law, and not assignable, but for the policy of that act.
The statute made warrants and the certificates of
survey assignable ; but the words 11shall hav- right
to, assign and transfer warrants and certificates of survey for lands," do not import any particular mode
of assignment. They give to the document its assignable quality, leaving the parties to choose their
own mode of evidencing the contract. Whether
they adopt the ancient policy of the common law,
requiring all assignments to be made by deed of indenture, or the more easy mode of endorsement or

If proof of

an assignment on paper, either attached to the wrlting or not, were now required, the'rightsdf assignees
would, at this time fail for millions of acres : for. if positive proof of an assignment must be made, in all
cases, by those claiming under it, 'the mere ink nd
paper importing the assignment would not be gufficient. Proof of the execution would be required :
in a great majority of cases, it could not be produced.
These papers passed from-hand to hand like coin; they
were owned by all classes of people ; as well by the
poor and illiterate, as by men oft business.
Warrants, in many cases, were left with the principal surveyors, for safe keeping, and a letter addressed
to him from the owner, to let another have so many
acres of warrant, was received as sufficient authority to make an entry for the assignee. These letters
could be produced in but few cases , but if required
at all, the mere production would not be evidenc-e.
Proof of the handwriting would be called for on the
appellant's principles. As to the cases cited from
the Kentucky Reports,: in onie of these, an assignMent was endorsed ; in the othera breach of trust existed. As against the patentee or those claiming under
him with notice, proof was admitted, in the one case,
that the assigninent was a forgery; in the othor, that

the confidence of the owner was abused. But this
proof was given by the owner of the warrant, not by
the claimants under the patent. In these cases the
nature of the claim could yet be traced ; in ours it
cannot.

From these cases, and the reason of the thing, it is

y
to be admitted on the other side, that it has been so
decided. But this admission is qualified. It is insisted that where the patent office contains the warrant, assignment, and survey, all in regular order,
there claimants of the warrant will be held to disprove
the derivative claim. If this be the rule, the patent is
but primafacieevidence of its own existence only, and
of nothing necessary to its existence. This notion
is fanciful, but not sound. The patent is prima facie evidence of an assignment, or it is not. If it is
primafacie eyidence, the appellants must wholly fail.
We have a patent to Massie's heirs, and which they
claim ]legally, and the other defendants, at least, equitably, (for we are in a court of equity,) and the appellants have no proof.
The act of 1809, referred to by the appellants'
counsel, gives him no aid. It recites that assignments
were sometimes made in a loose manner, and that
there was a consequent hazard in granting exchange warrants; and its provisions are prospective,
and all of them are merely directory to the register.
But if the claimants are held to the proof of an
assignment, in fact, they have made that proof. Anderson states that he came intQ office in July, 1784,
the commencement of the official duties in Kentucky;
has ever since held the office. At the commencement,
a few entries were made by another person; in 1812,
eight or ten by his daughter, while he was sick; bnd

entry on his records was Inade by himself. All those
on Jouitte's Were so made. They were all directed
by Massie.

He considered him agent at first, but

never saw a written power. Before the 27th January, 1795, Massie produced a written assignment, on
which he made the entry in question of that date.
He further states, that on the 14th June, 1797, he
delivered the assignment and warrant to Massie, with
the survey in question.
An attempt is made to discredit this testimony by
its intrinsic demerits. It is said to be wonderful, that
he should not recollect whether there were any witnesses to the assignment, what its date, and when
delivered to him. But the assignments in his office
are so numerous, that if at the distance of twentytwo years le should feign to recollect such particulars, that would, indeed, discredit him. It is further
objected to him, that he states that he never, but in
one instance, made an entry for an assignee, without
having the assignment, and that was not in the present case ; and that he pretends to recollect delivering
out the warrant in question, to whom and when. But
it is to be remembered, that upon delivering out official papers, entries are made, which assist the memory. As to the particular case of an entry, without
an assignment, it would be strange if he did rhot recollect it. That was the only case in an official life
of nearly forty years in which he suffered such an indiscretion to pass him. He was uneasy about it, and
made immediate inquiry of the owner. The attempt
to discredit'Anderson, from his own examination,
therefore fails.

OF THE UITED STATES.

So much .for Anderson's testimony under the
commission. Is it supported or defeated by the official evidence ?
Some apparent confusion occurs, which is cleared
up by an attention to dates. His second certificate
relates to the first transaction in point of time.
It was his practice to forward the assignment with
the first survey, in order that they might lay in the
patent office, to be referred to when other surveys
should be returned: and called thence a reference
paper. The warrant with the last. But lie delivered both the assignment and warrant to Massie,: with
the survey in question, being the first, which, as to
the latter, was a mistake. It was not recollected
that one or more surveys were yet to come. Of such
delivery an entry is made. The time and the occasion can, therefore, be recollected. If our hypothesis be right, Massie may be well supposed to have
delivered all-the papers into theWar Office, when ney
were destroyed by fire on the 8th of November, 1800.
After the destruction of the War Office, the surveyor is applied to for the last survey of 851 acres;
then it was that the warrant should have been delivered with the survey. But the warrant was not
found, and the memorandum book would show what
had become of it. He could not refer to the assignment
or warrant as reference papers, for they were destroyed. He, therefore, states what was the amount
of the assignment, and that the warrant was taken
from his office, by mistake, on the 14th of June,
1797. On these papers a grant issued for the 851

acres. Although Anderson might have stated in hig
certificate by whom the warrant was taken, and on
what occasion, the omission to do so is unimportant.
By a law of Congress, patents can be had upon
lost papers, by taking a copy of the warrant from the
Register, or a copy of the plait and certificate from
the surveyor, and satisfying the officer of the loss of
the papers by his own oath,, or otherwise. Massie
made affidavit on the copy of.the platt and certificate,
that the original, of which that was a copy, had been
filed in the War Office, and that it had been lost or
destroyed. The omission to state that the warrant
and assignment accompanied the plat, and were destroyed with it. He got them all in order to procure
a patent. It was his interest to file them ; and it is
incredible that he did not.
But supposing the assignment not to be clearly
proved, the Court will presume one from the circumstances, in order to support the possession.
On the subject of such presumptions, generally,
reference may be had to the authorities cited in the
argument of another cause at the present term.. To
these may be added some of the decisions in the local
tribunals. Thus the Court of Appeals of Virginia
have determined that, though the presumption arising from the lapse of time may be repelled by circumstances, yet those circumstances must be clearly proved, which, in the present case, they are not.'

lands of another on the opposite side, against which
to abut his dam, may acquire it contrary to the will
of the owner. He procures a writ from the County
Court in nature of a writ ad quod damnum, to value
the land. The law provides, that upon paying that
value, the party shall be seized of the land condemned. In the case in question, the condemnation
had taken place in 1777. The money had not been
paid ; the land had been sold ; possession had gone
with the condemnation, and a mill had been built.
The statute period of limitation had not elapsed, yet
the Court presume the fact of payment: the very
fact which devests one man and invests another with
the inheritance.a In another case a testator had appointed several executors, and impowered them fo"
sell. Some had qualified, and some had not. They
who qualified, sold and conveyed. Time had not
elapsed to bar a writ of right. The case was decided under the stat. 21 Hen. VIII. c. 4. The deed
was absolutely void ; it passed no estate in law or
equity, unless it appeared that the other executors
had renounced. The Court determined that the
renunciation was a fact, which admitted of proof in.
pais as well as by record ; but that in favour of the
possession it might be inferred from circumstances."
The presumption sustained in the cases quoted,
vastly exceeds what is required in ours. In our case
the circumstances are unanswerable.
The appellants cannot rely on any supposed difference between an imperfect legal title and an equitable one, as to the question of either presumption or

owner of a land warrant, who has never parted with
his right to it, may regard the person, who intermeddies with it, as acting for him; and thus claim and
hold the land appropriated, although he never directed the location.
It is also said, that as the legal title was invested
in Massie's heirs by the patent to them, that tide
enures to the benefit of those to whom Massie had
previously conveyed without title, and that therefore
the defendants are invested with a legal title. This
proposition cannot be sustained. It is true, that in
certai'n cases, where a person conveys without title,
and the same person afterwards obtains title, as between such person, and the person to whom a conveyance was made, the after acquired title cannot be
set up to prejudice the purchaser. But this proceeds
upon the doctrine of estoppel, and can have no application to a case like this, where the person with
whom the title first commenced, is seeking to assert
it against those who have unfairly got possession
of it.
It is conceded that a warrant for lands is made
assignable by the statute that authorized it to issue;
and it is said, that it is the mere evidence of an executory contract betweerr the State and a citizen.
The contract is for a grant of land, hereafter to be
made, and the warrant is evidence of that contract.

land when granted: but the evidence of right before

fer is, therefore, not a power to make a sale of the
-:Rouldia j subject; and it is apprehended that a deed of indenv.
ture was never used at the common law to transfer
Massid's
to a purchaser a legal tight in any written evidence
ffeir,.
of an executory contract.
The warrant, or platt and certificate of survey, is
the subject that is to be transferred by the act of asisignment, and it seems indispensable that there should
be some direct connection between an act and the
subject ujion which it operates. Hence we insist,
that an assignment can only be made as before suggested.
It is not pretended, that a purchaser of a warrant
cannot hold, unless it be thus assigned. The principle is applied to the evidence that ought to be xequired. If the assignment be endorsed upon the
warrant, or be executed upon a separate paper, and
connected with the warrant, these facts might be
considered prima' facia evidence of a sale, sufficient
at least to put the claimant upon some proof to impeach.them. But where nothing of this kind exists,
and a purchase be claimed, such purchase is wholly
matter -in pais, and he who claims under it must furnish the proof of its existence. Until such proof be
furnished, there is nothing for the other party to
impeach.
This might be insisted -upon even after the patent
emanated. The law requires the warrant and platt,
and certificate upon which the grant emanates, to be
carefully preserved. And this is not without object.
That-object would seem to be a preservation of the
evidence upon which the grant was obtained, that

the fact of ownership, decided exparte by the officers of the land office, might be fairly open for investikation. But certainly this matter of fact cannot be presumed against an original owne'f, before
.the patent issues, and we insist that this case stands
as if the patent had not issued. And, besides, it is
conceived, that this fact ought not to be presumed

against an owner, in a case standing as this does,
where the proof is clear that the patent was issued
upon evidence that did not authorize it.
That a very loose method of transferring land
warrants was adopted and practised, cannot vary the
law, nor. has it been considered- to have had that consequence. The cases cited show, that property in
these warrants could not be acquired by delivery as
in the case of other chattels. The mischiefs apprehended do not exist. We do not claim that the warrant can be followed into the hands of an innocent
purchaser of the legal title. But we conceive that
the patentee is not such a purchaser. It is incumbent upon him to know that he is fairly owner of
the intermediate evidence of title; and if he is not,
he ought not to-hold the land. This is the policy of
the act of 1809, and though prospective as to its enactments respecting future assignments, it plainly intimates, by its provisions for existing cases that its
authors contemplated no such thing as an assignment,
distinct and separate from the subject claimed to be
assigned. If any mischief results from the doctrine
asserted, it can only fall upon those, who have possessed themselves of the rights of others, without

takinz proper precaution to be certain, that they were
not aiding to do injustice.
?
It is also insisted lbr the defendants, that, although
an assignment in fact may not be' proved, yet from
the circumstances, the Court will presume an assignment to support the possession.
All presumptions stand upon their own particular
circumstances. But presumptions are never resorted
to where the facts are otherwise understood. Hero
the nature and character of the pretended assignment
is fully in evidence. It stands surrounded with many suspicious circumstances. Proofs as well as
presumptions are strong against the fairness of
Massie's conduct. In such a case it would surely
be very unsafe to found a title upon presumption.
In all the cases cited, the parties were all residents in the same neighbourhood. The claimants witnessed daily the acts of ownership exercised,
and improvements made by the other party. From
their omission to assert any right, the presumption
naturally arose, that they had no right to assert.
Here the case was different. After commencirg his
title the original proprietor died. His heir knew nothing of what was done. She resided in the interior
of Virginia; the land office was in Kentucky; the
lands in the'wilderness of Ohio. It is going too far
to say, that she was bound to take notice of the entry in the office, in Kentucky, and of the improvements commenced and carried on in Ohio. It is
palpable that she was in fact unacquainted with the
whole subject. The Court are asked to presume
first, that she was apprised of that of which she was
really ignorant, and from that presumption to presume

OF THE UNITED -STATES.

again, that she knew there was a sate, or assignment,
and for that reason forbore~Bouldin
to assert her pretensions.
The time, in this case, under its circumstances,
would not bar a recovery on ejectment, in Ohio ; an
inchoate legal title ought not to be destroyed by presumption in- a shorter period. It is believed, that
none of the cases go so far.
The certificate of the Court of Albemarle County
is sufficient, in this case, to prove the heirship of the
plaintiff, Alice, and her intermarriage with the other
plaintiff. The .fac. are evidently denied in the answer, proforma. The defendants assert only their
igdorance, and ask proof. The certificate in question is exactly thatkind of evidence, which is taken to
establish the primfacie right of the-party to a warrant,platt, and certificate, andpatent as heir, or representative, and ought to be sufficient to satisfy those,
who profess only that they know nothing, and therefore call for proof.
The surveyor's certificate that the warrant was assigned, has been received in the-land office, as evidence of such assignment, and when the commissioner
has acted upon it, and issued the grant, the defendant's counsel has strongly urged, that he who claims
against it, must disprove it. We ask no more in the
case of the certificate of the County Court. There
is no act of Congress directing such certificate to be
received for any purpose.
In respect to this the
counsel are mistaken.

CASES IN THE SUPREMDIE COURT

It may be doubted whether the act of the 10th of
1790, authorized the issuing of a patent in
SAugust,
the name of an assignee. This doubt however is entirely removed by the act of June 9th, 1794, c. 238,
which enactsthat every officer and soldier, his heirs or
assigns, entitled to bounty lands,&c. according to the
laws of Virginia, "shall, on producing the warrant, or t.
certified copy thereof, and a certificate under'the seal
of the office where the said warrants are legally kept,
that the same or a part thereof remains uncertified,
and on producing the survey agreeably to the laws
of Virginia, for the tract or tracts to which he or they
may be entitled as aforesaid, to the Secretary of the
Department of War, such officer or soldier, his or
their heirs or assigns, shall be entitled to and receive
a patent for the same, from the President of the United States, any thing in any former law to the contrary notwithstanding."
This act recognizes the right of the assignee to a
patent, without prescribing the manner in which the
assignment isto be proved. It requires the production of the warrant, or a certified copy thereof, and of
the plat and certificate of survey, but gives no rule respecting the proof of the assignment.
It is admitted that the assignment may be endorsed on the warrant, or may be connected with it, and
that the warrant may remain in the surveyor's office,
since a patent may be issued for a part of it, as was
done in this case, while a part remains unsatisfied ;
and may be issued on a certified copy of it. It would
seem, from these circumstances, that proof of the assignment might be received by the surveyor.

OF THE UNITED STATES,

If the warrant were assigned by endorsement before the entryor if the entry were assigned and trans.
â€¢
ferred before the survey, the survey would be made
and certified to the land office, in the name of the assignee. The law does not, in terms, require that the
original assignment, or a copy of it, should be transmitted to the office with the survey. It would seem
then, that in ordinary cases, proof of the assignment
might be made in the surveyor's office, and certified
to the land office.
Unquestionably, if notice were given by any person claiming title against the certificate of the surveyor, the fact would be examinable before the emanation of the patent ; but, as no law requires that the
assignment should be submitted to the person who
issues the patent, or be always examined and decided
on by him, nothing seems to oppose the practice of
relying, in ordinary cases, on the surveyor's certificate. If such be the rule of the office, the Court
ought not to disregard it; and that it is the rule, is,
we think, to be inferred from the fact that this patent
has been issued to the assignee in this case on such
testimony, and that the bill does not charge it to have
been issued irregularly. It denies the assignmentbut not-that the usual proof of it was made in the
land office. In this case the survey was made in the
name of the assignee, and the surveyor certifies that
the warrant was assigned to the extent of the survey.
We must suppose that the usual proof of the assignment was received.
By the act of the 3d of March, 1803, c. W43, it is
enacted, that "1where any warrants granted by the

platt and certificate of survey frQrt the office of the
surveyor in which the same was recorded, andziming
satisfactory proof-to the Secretary of War, by his atfidavit, or otherwise, of the loss or destruction of said
warrant, or platt and certificate of survey."
This act has been literally complied with, except
that instead of "a certified duplicate of the warrant
from the land-office of Virginia," we find a copy of
the warrant, certified by Richard C. Anderson, the
principal surveyor, dated the 30th of April, 1796,
when the warrant was in his office, and the certificate regularly and officially given, and written on
the back of a survey, No. 1629, for 400 acres, part of
the said warrant, on which a patent was issued to
Robert Jouitte, dated the 28th day of October, 1799.
The purpose for which a certified duplicate from
the land office of Virginia was required in the case of
a lost warrant, undoubtedly was to protect the United
States from fraudulent claims on warrants alleged
to be lost, but which never existed; not to settle controversies between the original holder and those
claiming under him by assignment. The land office
of the United States being in possession of pan official copy of that warrant, on which a patent had
been issued, no motive existed for requiring a dupli-

OF THE UNITED STATES.

cate from the land office of Virginia. The original
existence of such warrant could not be more fully
proved, and the evidence of it which was in the offlee was such as the law deemed satisfactory at the
time it was received. But if this were an irregularity, it is one which could only affect the United States,
and is of no consequence in this cause, since all parties admit the existence of the warrant and claim under it.
This patent then must be considered as having issued regularly, on the documents required by the
rules of the office ; at least so far as concerns the parties.before the court. The title of the person who
has obtained it is undoubtedly examinable, but no
presumption exists against him.
The testimony of Anderson, the principal surveyor, has been taken, for the purpose of proving the.assignments from Jouitte to M assie. He deposes that
the office was opened for making entries on the
north-west side of the Ohio, on the 1st day of August, 1787, and that he had continued ever since to
transact the business in person, with the exception of
a short time which he mentions, and which does not
comprehend the making of the entries in this case.
He has never, except in one instance, which was not
Jouittels, made entries in the name of an assignee,
without having previously received the assignment,
and in that instance he was informed by the original
proprietor of the warrant himself, that he had sold it.

on the 19th day of November, 1784, (he thinks'by
Robert Jouitte himself,) and that the witness made

all the entries on it. He has no hesitation in saying
the -assignment was prior to the entry on which this
survey was made, or he could not have made the entry. On being asked whether the assignment was
on the warrant, or on a separate piece of paper, lie
answers, on a separate paper, he presumes, as the
first entries were made in Jouitte's name. On being cross-interrogated by the plaintiff, he says, that
he does not recollect the precise time when the assignment was produced in his office, but it was not
prior to the 27th of January, 1796, (the date of the
first entry in the name of Massie,) and to the best of
his recellection, purported and appeared to be made
by Jouitte himself. He does not recollect its date,
nor whether i' was attested.by a subscribing witness.
It was lodged in his office by Nathaniel Massie, and
taken out with the platt and certificate of survey of
the assigned part of the warrant, by him, on the 14th
of June, 1797.
In corroboration of the testimony of Anderson,
the defendants rely on a grant made to Massie, on
the 2d of January, 1802, on a survey made the 1st
of April, 1797, for Massie, as assignee of part of the
same warrant. The entry was made on the 27th of
January, 1795, and the patent contains a recital nf
the assignment of 2051 acres, part of Jouitte's warrant.
It is impossible to read the testimony of the principal surveyor, or to credit it, without believing that
an assignment purporting to be made by Jouitte,
was produced by Massie, and deposited in his office.

that instance, his admission of entries in the name of
MVassie, as assignee, in the life-time of Jouitte, his
averment that the assignment was placed in his office, and taken out with the platts and certificates of
survey by Massie, prove that there must have been
. such a paper. But the proof of its being executed
by Jouitte, is certainly not so explicit as it might or
ought to have been. Colonel Anderson does not say
that he was acquainted with the handwriting of
Jouitte, and believed the assignment to have been
written by him. But he acted as a public officer on
the full conviction of this fact and his whole tcstimony proceeds upon the idea that he was entirely
satisfied of the verity of the instrument. Jouitte
and himself having been officers in the same service,
it is not improbable that the handwriting of the one
was known to the other; and to the question whether the assignment purported to be made by Jouitte
himself, or by an agent, he answers that it 91purported and appeared to him to be made by Jouitte himself, to the best of his recollection." The word
"a1ppeared," which is introduced by the witness in
his answer to this interrogatory, and which is not in
the question, seems intended to indicate that he had
formed an opinion on the handwriting. Had the
plaintiff suspected that Anderson wag not acquainted
with the handwriting of Jouitte, or not perfectly satisfied that this assignment was in his handwriting,

some question would have been propounded indicating this suspicion. But no such question is propounded; and we can make no other justifiable inference from his whole testimony and conduct, than
that he was acquainted with the handwriting of
Jouitte, and was satisfied' that the assignment was
written by him.
Oil the character of the principal surveyor no imputation is cast. His office is a proof of the confidence reposed in his integrity by those who knew
him. His testimony is incorrect, is studiously calculated to establish an untruth, and his official conduct
fraudulent, if he had no sufficient knowledge of the
verity of the assignment. That his testimony is less
explicit than it ought to have been ; that it omits the
express averment of a fact, implied by all lie says,
and which is necessary to its fhirness and its truth,
will not, we think, justify a presumption against that
fact. We understand Colonel Anderson's testimony
as implying a knowledge of the handwriting of Mr.
Jouitte, and of the verity of the assignment.
There is still another defect in the testimony
which is by no means inconsiderable, and which has
"been strongly pressed by the counsel for the plainti. The assignment itself is not produced, and there
is no direct proof of its loss. Its absence depriving
the plaintiffs of the power of disproving it, is a circumstance calculated to excite suspicion, and ought
to be accounted for. The rule that the loss of a paper'ought to be established before its contents can he
be proved, is well settled, and ought t6 be maintained. Yet there are difficulties in applying it to this
case whieh are not to be surmounted.

specting it therefore cannot be demanded, which
might be required were it relied on as composing
part of the title.. It was not absolutely incumbent
on, the assignee to preserve it after the emanation of
-the patent ; and he could not, unless, the transaction
be presumed fraudulent, foresee this controversy. He
died before any claim on the part of the plaintiffs was
asserted, before any denial of the assignment was
made, and therefore coild not be expected to prepare
testimony in its support, or to dceountfor its loss.
Had-the assignee been living he might be-expected
to show, at least by his own affidavit, supported by
probable circumstances, the loss of the assignment;
but he died before the occurrence of any circumstanstance which might suggest the propriety of such an
affidavit. The defendants have done all in their power. They aver their belief that the assignment was
real, their total ignorance of its present existence,
and their belief of its destruction, and they state the
probability that it was burnt with the papers of the
war office.
Under all the circumstances of the case, the probability of its being consumed in the war office is
great. The assignment was delivered with the warrant, and the platt and certificate of survey, to Alassie, on the 14th of June, 1797. It might be supposed proper to deposit it with those papers in the war
office for the purpose of obtaining the patenf. There

there deposited, and consumed with the other pa-

pers of the office.
We think, too, that the length of time which was
permitted to elapse before any inquiries appear to
have been made respecting this property, furnishes
strong evidence of the opinion that Mr. Jouitte had
parted with his interest in it. So early as January, 1795, between one and two years before the
death of Jouitte, Massie claimed a part of the warrant as his own, and made entries on it in the publie office, in his own name as assignee. It is not probable that a property which constituted no inconsiderable part of the estates of the officers, should have
been neglected by this officer in his life time, or by
his family after his death. Inquiries respecting it
would naturally have been made, not by the daughter, who may be supposed to have been an infant, but
by her mother, her guardian, or other friends. The
omission to make these inquiries may be accounted
for if it was known that the warrant was assigned:
not otherwise, without imputing to those relatives of
the infant, a considerable degree of negligence.
We think that under these circumstances the nonproduction of the assignment ought not so to operate
against the defendants as to defeat their legal title.
But the plaintiffs deny the validity of the assignment, because it was not made on the warrant, nor
annexed to it.
The law which authorized the assignment of warrants did not require, that it should be made by endorsement, or by any instrument annexed to the war-

case, the assignment could neither have been endorsed nor annexed without great ir. o lvenience. The
warrant was filed in the office of the Surveyor General, with the entries. This would occur in every
case where the entries in whole or in part were made.
The original proprietors resided generally in Virginia. The warrants were deposited in the office of the
Surveyor General, in Kentucky. These warrants,
thus deposited, and the entries made on them, were
transferrable. It is obvious that the transfer, if no
law forbid it, would be made on a separate paper. If
any particular mode of authentication was necessary,
the law ought to have prescribed that mode. This
not being done, the mode was left to the parties.
The subsequent act 6f the legislature of Virginia,
rather shows the mischief which had grown out of
this state of things, and of the practice under the
law, than that the practice under the law was contrary to the legislative construction of it.
This is one of those cases in which the equity of
the plaintiffs is not, we thinks sufficiently proved to
deprive-the defendants of their legal title.
