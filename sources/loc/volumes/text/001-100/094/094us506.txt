So ordered.
M_ JUSTICE STRONG dissented.

ALLORE v. JEWELL.
1. Whenever there is great weakness of mind, though not amounting to absolute
disqualification, arising from age, sickness, or any other cause, in a person
executing a conveyance, andkthe consideration given for the land is grossly
inadequate, - court of equity will, upon proper and seasonable application
of the injured party, or his representatives or heirs, interfere and set the
corveyance aside.
2. When a person, from infirmity and mental weakness, is likely to be easily
influenced by others, transactions entered into by such person without independent advice will be set aside, if there is any unfairness in them. The
principle upon which courts act in such cases, applied to a conveyance of
land obtained from a woman advanced in years, of doubtful sanity, living
entirely by herself, without friends to take care of her, and confined to
her house by sickness.
8. The lapse of time, six years, before bringing suit to cancel a conveyance so
obtained, cannot avail the defendant where he has had possession of the
land, and a reasonable rent therefor is equal to the value of his improvements thereon, and there has been no loss of evidence preventing a full
presentation of the case.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Michigan.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.

Hr. Alfred Russell for the appellant.

MR. JUSTICE FIELD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is a suit brought by the heir-at-law of Marie Genevieve
Thibault, late of Detroit, Mich., to cancel a conveyance of
land alleged to have been obtained from her a few weeks before
her death, when, from her condition, she was incapable of understanding the nature and effect of the transaction.

ALLORE V. JEWELL.

,507

The deceased lied at Detroit on the 4th of February, 1864,
intestate, leaving the complainant her sole surviving heir-at-law.
For many years previous to her death, and until the execution
of the conveyance to the defendant, she was seised in fee of the
land in controversy, situated in that city, which she occupied as
a homestead. In November, 1863, the defendant obtained from
her a conveyance of this property. A copy of the conveyance is
set forth in the bill. It contains covenants of seisin and warranty
by the grantor, and immediately following them an agreement
by the defendant to pay her $250 upon the delivery of the instrument ; an annuity of $500 ; all her physician's bills during
her life ; the taxes on the property for that year, and all subsequent taxes during her life; also, that she should 'have the use
and occupation of the house until the spring of 1864, or that he
would pay the rent of such other house as she might occupy
until then. The property was then worth, according to the
testimony in the case, between $6,000 and $8,000. The deceased was at that time between sixty and seventy yeaxs of age,
and wag confined to her house by sickness, from which she never
recovered. She lived alone, in a state of great degradation, and
was without regular attendance in her sickness. There were
no persons present with her at the execution of the conveyance,
except the defendant, his agent, and his attorney. The $250
stipulated were paid, but no other payment was ever made to
her; she died a few weeks afterwards.
As grounds for cancelling this conveyance, the complainant
alleges that the deceased, during the last f.w years of her life,
was afflicted with lunacy or chronic insanity, and was so infirm
as to be incapable of transacting any business of importance;
that her last sickness aggravated her insanity, greatly weakened
her mental faculties, and still more disqualified her for business; that the defendant and his agent knew of her infirmity,
and that there was no reasonable prospect of her recovery from
herisickness, or of her long surviving, when the conveyance was
taken; that she did not understand the nature of the instrument ; and that it was obtained for an insignificant consideration, and in a clandestine manner, without her having any
independent advice.
These allegations the defendant controverts, and avers that

ALLORE V. JEWELL.

[Sup. Ot.

the conveyance was taken upon a proposition of the deceased;
that at the date of its execution she was in the full possession
of her mental faculties, appreciated the value of the property,
and was capable of contracting with reference to it, and of selling or otherwise dealing with it; that since her death he has
occupied the premises, and made permanent improvements to
the value of $7,000; and that the complainant never gave him
notice of any claim to the property until the commencement of
this suit.
The court below dismissed the bill, whereupon the complainant appealed here. The question presented for determination
is, whether the deceased, at the time she executed the conveyance in questioAi, possessed sufficient intelligence to understand
fully the nature ana effect of the transaction ; and, if so, whether
the conveyance was executed under such circumstances as that
it ought to be upheld, or as would justify the interference of
equity"for its cancellation.
Numerous witnesses were examined in the case, and a large
amount of testimony was taken. This testimony has been carefully analyzed by the defendant's counsel; and it must be admitted that the facts detailed by any one witness with reference
to the condition of the deceased previous to her last illness, considered separately and apart from the statements of the others,
do not 'show incapacity to transact business on her part, nor
establish insanity, either continued or temporary. And yet,
when all the facts stated by the different witnesses are taken
together, one is led irresistibly by their combined effect to the
conclusion, that, if the deceased was not afflicted with insanity
for some years before her death, her mind wandered so near the
line which divides sanity from insanity as to render any important business transaction with her of doubtful propriety, and to
justify a careful scratiny into its fairness.
Thus, some of the witnesses speak of the deceased as having
low and filthy habits; of her being so imperfectly clad as at
times to expose immodestly portions of her person; of her eating with her fingers, and having vermin on her body. Some of
them testify to her believing in dreams, and her imagining she
could see ghosts and spirits around her room, and her claiming
to talk with them; to her being incoherent in her conversation,

passing suddenly and without cause from one subject to another;
to her using vulgar and profane language; to her making immodest gestures; to her talking strangely, and making singular
motions and gestures in her neighbors' houses and in the streets.
Other witnesses testify to further peculiarities of life, manner,
and conduct; but none of the peculiarities mentioned, considered
singly, show a want of capacity to transact business. Instances
will readily occur to every one where some of them have been
exhibited by persons possessing good judgment in the management and disposition of property. But when all the peculiarities mentioned, of life, conduct, and language, are found in the
same person, they create a strong impression that his mind is
not entirely sound; and all transactions relating to his property
will be narrowly scanned by a court of equity, whenever brought
under its cognizance.
The condition of the deceased was not improved during her
last sickness. The testimony of her attending physician leads
to the conclusion that her mental infirmities were aggravated
by it. He states that he had studied her disease, and for many
years had considered her partially insane, and that in his opinion
she was not cmpetent in November, 1863, during her last sickness, to understand a document like the instrument executed.
The physician also testifies that during this month he informed
one Dolsen, who had inquired of the condition and health of the
deceased, and had stated that efforts had been made to purchaso
her property, that in his opinion she could not survive her sickness, and that she was not in a condition to Make any sale of
the property "in a right -way."
This Dolsen had at one time owned and managed a tannery
adjoining the home of the deceased, which he sold to the defendant. After the sale, he carried on the business as the
defendant's agent. Through him the transaction for the purchase of the property was conducted. The deceased understood English imperfectly, and Dolsen undertook to explain to
her, in French, the contents of the paper she executed. Some
attempt is made to show that he acted as her agent; but this is
evidently an afterthought. He was in the employment of the
defendant, had charge of his business, and had often talked
with him about securing the property; and in his interest be

ALLORE V. JEWELL.

[SLIP. Ot

acted throughout. If the deceased was not in a condition to
dispose of the property, she was not in a condition to appoint
an agent for that purpose.
The defendant himself states that he had seen the deceased
for years, and knew that she was eccentric, queer, and penurious.
It is hardly credible that, during those years, carrying on business within a few yards of her house, he had not heard that her
mind was unsettled; or, at least, had not inferred that such
was the fact, from what he saw of her jconduct. Be that as it
may, Dolsen's knowledge was his knowledge; and, when he
covenanted to pay the annuity, some inquiry must have been
had as to the probable duration of the payments. Such covenants are not often made without inquiries of that nature; and
to Dolsen he must have looked for information, for he states
that he conversed with no one else about the purchase. With
him and with his attorney he went to the house of the deceased,
and there witnessed the miserable condition in which she lived,
and he states that he wondered how anybody could live in such
a place, and that he told Dolsen to get her a bed and some
clothing. Dolsen had previously informed him that she would
not sell the property; yet he took a conveyance from her at a
consideration which, under the circumstances, with a certainty
almost of her speedy decease, was an insignificant one compared
with the value of the property.
In view of the circumstances stated, we are not satisfied that
the deceased was, at the time she executed the conveyance,
capable of comprehending fully the nature and effect of the
transaction. She was in a state of physical prostration; and
from that cause, and her previous infirmities, aggravated by
her sickness, her intellect was greatly enfeebled; and, if not
disqualified, she was unfitted to attend to business of such
importance as the disposition of her entire property, and the
securing of an annuity for life. Certain it is, that, in negotiating
for the disposition of the property, she stood, in her sickiess and
infirmities, on no terms of equality with the defendant, who,
with his attorney and agent, met her alone in her hovel to
obtain the conveyance.
It is not necessary, in order to secure the aid of equity, to
prove that the deceased was at the time insane, or in such a

state of mental imbecility as to render her entirely incapable of
executing a valid deed. It is sufficient to show that, from her
sickness and infirmities, she was at the time in a condition of
great mental weakness, and that there was gross inadequacy of
consideration for the conveyance. From these circumstances,
imposition or undue influence -will be inferred. In the case of
Hardingv. Wheaton, reported in the 2d of. Mason, a conveyance
executed by one to his son-in-law, for a nominal consideration,
and upon a verbal arrangement that it should be considered as
a trust for the maintenance of the grantor, and after his death
for the benefit of his heirs, was, after his death, set aside, except
as security for actual advances and charges, upon application
of his heirs, on the ground that it was obtained from him
when his-mind was enfeebled by age and other causes. "] xtreme weakness," said Mr. Justice Story, in deciding the case,
"1will raise an almost necessary presumption of imposition, even
,when it stops short of legal incapacity; and though a contract,
in the ordinary course of things, reasonably made with such a
person, might be admitted to stand, yet if it should appear to
be of such" a nature as that such a person could not be capable
of measuring its extent or importance, its reasonableness or its
value, fully and fairly, it cannot be that the law is so much at
variance with common sense as to uphold it." The case subsequently came before this court.; and, in deciding it, Mr. Chief
Justice Marshall, speaking of this, and, it would seem, of other
deeds executed by the deceased, said: "If these deeds were
obtained by the exercise of undue influence over a man whose
mind had ceased to be the safe guide of his actions: it is against
conscience for him who has obtained them to derive any advantage from them. It is the peculiar province of a court of conscience to set them aside. That a court of equity will interpose
in such a case is among its best-settled principles. Rardivg v.
Handy, 11 Wheat. 125.
The same doctrine is announced in adjudged cases, almost
without number; and it may be stated as settled law, that
whenever there is great weakness of mind in a person executing
a conveyance of land, arising from age, sickness, or any, other
cause, though not amounting to absolute disqualification, and
the consideration given for the property is grossly inadequate.

ALLORE V. JEWELL.

[Sup. Ct.

a court of equity will, upon proper and seasonable application
of the injured party, or his representatives or heirs, interfere
and set the conveyance aside. And the present case comes
directly within this principle.
In the recent case of Xempson v. Askbee, 10 Ch. Cas. 15,
decided in the Court of Appeal in Chancery in England, two
bonds executed by a young woman, living at the time with her
mother and step-father, -one,
at the age of twenty-one, as
surety for her step-father's debt, and the other, at the age of
twenty-nine, to secure the amount of a judgment recovered on
the first bond, - were set aside as against her, on the ground that
she had acted in the transaction without independent advice;
one of the justices observing that the court had endeavored to
prevent persons subject to influence from being induced to
enter into transactions without advice of that kind. The principle upon which the court acts in such cases, of protecting the
weak and dependent, may always be invoked on behalf of
persons in the situation of the deceased spinster in this case, of
doubtful sanity, living entirely by herself, without friends to
take care of her, and confined to her house by sickness. As
well on this ground as on the ground of weakness of mind and
gross inadequacy of consideration, we think the case a proper
one for the interference of equity, and that a cancellation of
the deed should be decreed.
The objection of the lapse of time- six years -before bringing
the suit cannot avail the defendant. If during this time, from
the death of witnesses or other causes, a full presentation of the
facts of the case had become impossible, there might be force
in the objection. But as there has been no change in this
respect to the injury of the defendant, it does not lie in his
mouth, after having, in the manner stated, obtained the property
of the deceased, to complain that her heir did not sooner bring
suit against him to compel its surrender. There is no statutory
bar in the case. The improvements made have not cost more
than the amount which a reasonable rent of the property would
have produced, and the complainant, as we understand, does
not object to allow the defendant credit for them. And as to
the small amount paid on the execution of the conveyance, it
is sufficient to observe, that the complainant received from the

administrator of the deceased's estate only $113.42; and there
is no evidence that he ever knew that this sum constituted any
portion of the money obtained from the defendant. A decree
must, therefore, be entered for a cancellation of the deed of the
deceased and a surrender of the property to the complainant,
but without any accounting for back rents, the improvements
being taken as an equivalent for them.
-Deeree reversed, and cause remanded with directions to enter
a decree as thtus stated.
MR. JUSTIOE STRONG, -with whom concurred MR. Omarx
JUSTIoE WAiTF and MR. JUSTICE BRADLEY, dissenting.
I cannot concur in the judgment given in this case. Were
there no other reason for my dissent, it would be enough that
the complainant has been guilty of inexcusable laches. He
knew every thing of which he now complains, in February,
1864, when the grantor of the defendant died, and when his
rights as her heir vested; and yet he waited until six years
and nine months thereafter before he brought this suit, and
before he made any complaint of the sale she had made.
Meanwhile, he accepted the money the defendant had paid on
account of the purchase, and he stood silently by, asserting no
claim, while the defendant was making valuable improvements
upon the lot, at a cost of $6,000 or $7,000, a sum about equal
to the value of the property at the time of the purchase. To
permit him now to assert that the sale was invalid, because the
vendor was of weak mind, is to allow him to reap a profit from
his own unconscionable silence and delay. I cannot think a
court of equity should lend itself to such a wrong.
