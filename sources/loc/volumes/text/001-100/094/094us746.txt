TATE v. NORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

TATE v. NORTON.
1. In Arkansas, the real as well as the personal estate of the intestate is assets in
the bands of an administrator; but neither species of property can be sold
without an order of the Probate Court.
2. A claim admitted by the administrator, and allowed and classified by the Probate Court, has the dignity and effect of a judgment.
8. There can be no devastauit which will sustain an action against an administrator until be has violated an order of the Probate Court to pay creditors;
and his accounts settled by that court cannot be collaterally attacked, but
are conclusive, until, by a direct proceeding in equity instituted for that purpose, they are impeached for fraud or mistake.
APPEAL from the Circuit Court of the United States for the
Eastern District of Arkansas.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
Submitted on printed arguments by .Mr. W. H. Rose and
H1r. A. ff. Garlandfor the appellants, and by Jfr. Albet Pike
and Mr. Robert W. Johnson for the appellees.

MR. JUSTICE SWAYKE delivered the opinion of the court.

A brief statement of the facts of this case is necessary to
render intelligible the conclusions at which we have arrived.
Joseph W. Clay, of the State and county of Arkansas, died
intestate in May, 1853. He left a widow, Sarah G. Clay, since
deceased, and three minor children, - Joseph W. Clay, also
since deceased; Mary S. Clay, slice married to Thomas G.
Tate; and Caroline Clay, since married to Raynor W. Whitfield. The four parties last named are the appellants.
Thomas Fletcher, the brother of the widow, was appointed
by the Probate Court of the proper county administrator of
the estate, and qualified as such in July, 1853. Immediately
after qualifying he took possession of all the property which
belonged to the intestate at the time of his death. It consisted
of lands, stock, farming utensils, slaves, and a small amount of
money. The value of the lands at that time does not appear.
The appraisers estimated the other property at $129,445.54.
The slaves were an important item. They were inventoried
at $113,400, leaving the balance of other assets $16,045.54.
The indebtedness of the estate represented by the claims pre.

sented and allowed by the administrator amounted to $103,
436.62. According to the law of Arkansas, the widow was
entitled to the p6ssession and use for life of one-third of the
lands and of one-third of the slaves, irrespective of the claims
of creditors. She was also invested with the absolute ownership of one-third of the personal property.
The condition of the estate as regards the means of meeting
its liabilities is thus clearly presented. It requires no argument
to show that forced sales by the administrator to pay the debts
would have involved disaster, if not ruin, to the family of the
deceased. Such is the teaching of all experience. The intestate
had been largely engaged in raising cotton. The administrator
put hbimself, as it were, in the place of the deceased. Every
thing was carried on and conducted as before his death. Payments were made to the widow from time to time, the children
were supported and educated, the taxes were paid, crops were
raised, the cotton was sold, and the debts were discharged as
fast as the circumstances permitted.
In 1855, the legislature passed a law whereby the probate
courts were empowered to authorize administrators to do as
the administrator in this case did, provided that the time
limited for the settlement of estates, which was three years,
should not be extended. The administrator here claims that
he received such authority pursuant to this act. This. fact does
not appear. But it does appear that he made five full settlements with the Probate Court, - the first one in 1855 and the
last in 1870. The accounts are in the record. They exhibit
all his receipts and disbursements, and fully the manner in
which he was discharging the duties of the trust. It does not
appear that exception was taken by or in behalf of those concerned, nor that the Probate Court interposed any cheek or
objection. The administrator made no charge for compensation, and was allowed none. By the year 1858 he had paid
nearly all the debts. Before the late civil war began he had
paid them all but the debt upon which this suit is founded.
The commencement of the war was the beginning of the
troubles of the trust. The State was a battle-field. Troops on
-both sides were there. The slaves were sent to Texas for
safety. The mules and other live-stock were swept away by

TATE V. NORTON.

[Sup. 0t.

the advancing and receding tides of the conflict. The lands
hardly paid the expenses of cultivating them. Finally the
slaves as property were stricken out of existence. This involved a loss to the estate, according to the original inventory,
of more than $113,000 of the assets. The administrator became wholly unable to pay this debt. The answer avers, that,
but for the war, he could, by the year 1863, have extinguished
this demand also, and have then handed over to the heirs a
large and unincumbered estate for distribution among them.
The record shows that this was not an over-sanguine calculation. The calamity was unforeseen, and one for which the
admiinistrator was not responsible. The claim sought to be
collected by this proceeding was an account due from the intestate to Sweeney, Greene, & Co. They became insolvent,
and assigned it to Hewitt, Norton, & Co. They also became
insolvent, and assigned it to the creditors for whose benefit this
suit was instituted. The object of the bill is to subject the
lands of the intestate to the payment of the debt. It is alleged
that all the other assets have been exhausted.
It appears in this connection, that, after the claim was assigned to Hewitt & Co., they became the factors of the administrator for the sale of the cotton which he should raise, and
furnished him with money and supplies to carry on the business in which he was engaged for the benefit of the estate. It
was agreed that the accounts of the parties should be settled
annually, and that the balances found due upon such settlements to the administrator should be applied as credits upon
the assigned indebtedness. This was done, until the dealings
of the parties were put -an end to by the war. For several
years thereafter the administrator rented out the lands. Whether
leased out or cultivated, they yielded but little. There being
no prospect of the voluntary payment of the original debt, the
complainants filed their bill, as before stated, to enforce its
liquidation.
The appellants filed an answer and a cross-bill. They set
up, amongst other things, that the accounts of the dealings
between .the complainants and the administrator contained
overcharges in behalf of the former; that the proper credits
had not been given on the original debt; that the conduct of

Oct. 1876.]

TATE V. NORTON.

the administrator in the management of the estate was unwarranted and illegal; that he was guilty of a devastavit; and that
the entire proceeds of the cotton transmitted by the administrator to the complainants should have been applied by the
latter in satisfaction of the original debt of the estate. The
accounts and the original demand were referred to a master.
He revised the accounts, allowed further credits, and ascertained
the amount still due. Both parties excepted. The exceptions
were overruled. The court adopted the finding of the master
as to the amount due upon the demand in question, decreed
that it should be paid within the time specified, and that in the
event of default the lands described in the bill should be sold
as directed, and the proceeds applied as prayed by the complainants.
The appellants thereupon removed the case to this court ior
review. '
Our- further remarks will respond to the several objections
withoat naming them specifically, taken here to the decree
below.
The power of courts of equity in this class of cases is ample.
Their flexible jurisdiction is always applied as the substantial
interests of right and justice may require. Rook v. Payne,
7 Wall. 425; Yates v. Hambly, 3 Atk. 363; s. P. 2 id. 263;
Thompson v. Brown, 4 Johns. (N. Y.) Ch. 631.
The conduct of the administrator in the present case, though
without the sanction of strict law, did not involve a violation
of duty for which a court of equity will hold him responsible,
nor the commission of a devastavit.
In Thompson v. Brown, supra, the intestate had been a member of a trading firm. The administrator permitted his capital
to remain in the concern. He also put in other capital belong.
ing to the estate. The survivors failed, and became insolvent.
It was sought to make the administrator liable for both the capital which he left in and that which he put in. In an able and
learned examination of the subject by Chancellor Kent, he was
held bound for the latter, but not for the former. In his opinion,
the Chancellor remarked: "It is said that a court of equity will
sometimes appoint a person to carry on a trade for an infant
partner. Montague on Partnership, 187, and Sayer v. Bennet,

TATE V. NORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

there cited. 'And Lord Mansfield, in the case of Barker v.
Parker, 1 T. R. 295, observed, that he remembered many instances of trade being carried on under the direction of a court
of equity." See also WFedderburne v. Wedderburne, 22 Beav.
84, and Ryves v. Coleman, 3 Atk. 489. In Thompson v.
Brown, the Chancellor quoted with approbation the language
of Lord Hardwicke, in Knight v. The Earl of Plymouth, 3 Atk.
480, Dickens, 120, as follows: "If there was no mala fides,
nuthing wilful in the conduct of the trustee, the court will
always favor him. For a trust is necessary in the concerns
between man and man, and which, if faithfully discharged, is
attended with no small degree of trouble and anxiety. It is an
act of great kindness in any one to accept of it. To add hazard
or risk to that trouble, and to subject a trustee to losses which
he could not foresee would be a manifest hardship, and would
be deterring every one from accepting so necessary an office."
The same rule was applied by this court in 0lfarkey et al. v.
Langley et al., 92 U. S. 142.
A clearer case for the application of this principle can hardly
occur than is presented by the one before us. Throughout the
record there is not the slightest imputation, nor apparent
ground for any imputation, against the administrator. Even a
want of care, diligence, or good judgment is not alleged. His
management was eminently successful, until the war occurred.
That could neither be foreseen nor averted. It fell with crushing weight upon him. His plan for the redemption of the
estate was at once broken up. The means of prosecuting it
further were -inally lost. In the wreck, nothing was left but
the lands, and they without the means of turning them to any
account. To hold him responsible for these e6nsequences
would be alike contrary to the dictates of reason and justice,
and to the settled law of equity. Remonstrance or objection
from any quarter, until after the institution of this suit, is nowhere disclosed. In the light of this record, nothing that he
did can be lawfully challenged.
According to the laws of Arkansas, there can be no devastavit which will sustain an action until an order to pay creditors
has been made by the Probate Court, and violated by the administrator. Oatlaw v. Yell, 5 Ark. 478; G(ordonv. The State,

TATE V. NORTON.

11 id. 12; BBaker v. Te State, 21 id. 405; Brinkley v. Willis,
22 id. 6. Here no such order is shown. .De non apparentibus
et de non existentibus eadem est ratio. In that State, a claim
allowed by the administrator, and allowed and classified by the
Probate Court, has the dignity and effect of a judgment.
Gould's Dig., c. 4, sect. 115; Cossit v. Biscoe, 12 Ark. 95;
MeMorrin v. Overholt, 14 id. 244. Such was the status of the
claim here in question.
No discrimination is made by the law of that State between
real and personal property as assets. Both are in the hands of
the administrator, under his control, and liable to be subjected
to the payment of debts. Neither can be sold, unless the will
of the testator or an order of the Probate Court so direct. Dig.
Stat. of Ark., 1848, sect. 62, c. 4; id., p. 122, sect. 96, c. 4.
The accounts of an administrator settled by the Probate
Court cannot be collaterally attacked or questioned. They are
conclusive, until impeached for fraud or mistake in a direct proceeding in equity, instituted for that purpose. Dig., sect. 111,
c. 4; Clarke v. Shelton, 16 Ark. 480; Dooley v. Dooley, 14 id.
124.
Henry Paige acquired the entire interest in the estate of
Joseph W. Clay, Jr., deceased, in his lifetime, by proceedings
in bankruptcy. Paige made himself a paity to the suit by obtaining leave to file an answer. The answer does not appear
in the record; but that does not render the entry of his
appearance the less effectual.
The debt was sufficiently proved as. against the heirs, as well
as against the administrator. The action of the Probate Court
gave it the effect of a judgment as to both. The amount due
upon it was found by the master. The correctness of that
finding was not questioned here by the counsel for the appellants.
The exhaustion of all the assets except the lands is clearly
shown by the record. The accounts of the administrator, as
settled by the Probate Court, cover this ground. In the state
of the record they are conclusive. There is also proof of the
original amount of the debts and assets, of the amount of the
former which had been paid, and of the loss of assets by
the manumission of the slaves. In this view, also, it is clear

TATE v. NORTON.

[Sup. Ct.

there could have been no personal assets in the hands of the
administrator.
The validity of the administrator's dealings with the complainants has been already sufficiently considered.
The administrator was a trustee for the creditors, as well .as
for the heirs and distributees. Payne v. Hook, supra; Baker
v.. Grimes, 21 Ark. 405; Brinkley v. Willis, 22 id. 6. The
administration of the estate was in progress. There had been
no order by the Probate Court that the debts should be paid and
a final settlement made. The administrator had done nothing
in hostility to the claim. On the contrary, besides allowing it,
he had made payments upon it from time to time. The Statute
of. Limitations can have no application.
The assignment by Sweeney, Greene, & Co. to the complainants is admitted by the answers of Tate and wife, and by that
of the administrator. The evidence on the subject was not
objected to in the court below, and, therefore, cannot be objected to here. The assignment could have been well made by
parol. Ford v. Stewart, 19 Johns. (N. Y.) 844. The point
was not made before the master, when he found the amount
due, nor, so far as appears otherwise, in the court below. The
report was excepted to by the appellants, but not upon any
ground affecting this subject.
The assignment was made in New Orleans, and appears to
have been according to the law of Louisiana. Morgan's Code,
sect. 2288; Griffin v. Cowan, 15 La. Ann. 488; Scott v.
iHte.Dougall,14 id. 810 ; Dennison v. Duplissis, 12 La. 9.
It rested in the discretion of the court to order the sale of
the whole or of a part of the lands. It is not shown that the
sale of less than the whole will yield a sum sufficient to meet
the requirements of the decree. Error is never to be presumed:
it must be made clearly to appear. The execution .of the decree will be under the control of the court below; and care
will doubtless be taken that no wrong in this respect is done to

the appellants.
