MI. CHEEF JUSTIOE WAITE delivered the opinion of the
comt.
The only question presented by this record is whether a railroad company in Wisconsin can recover for the transportation
of property more than the maximum fixed by the act of March
11, 1874, by showing that the amount charged was no more
than a reasonable compensation for the services rendered.
What we have already said in _Peie v. Chicago &I Northwestern Bailway Company, and Lawrence v. Same, supra,p. 164,
is applicable to this case. As between the company and a
freighter, there is a statutory limitation of the charge for transportation actually performed. If the company should refuse to
carry at the prices fixed, and an attempt should be made to forfeit its charter on that aeccunt, other questions might arise,
which it will be time enough to consider when they are presented. But for goods actually carried, the limit of the recovery
is that prescribed by the statute.
Judgment affirmed.
