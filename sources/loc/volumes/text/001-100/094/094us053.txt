UNITED STATES v. BOSTWICK.

UNITED STATES v. BOSTWICK.
1. In this case, no formal lease of the property was executed; but the court holds
that the correspondence under which the United States entered into occupancy constituted a contract of letting for one year, with a privilege of
three, at a rent of 500 per month, without restriction as to the use to which
the property might be put.
2. Unless excluded by the operation of some express covenant or agreement,
there results from the relation of landlord and tenant an implied obligation
on the part of the latter not to commit waste, nor, by his failure to exercise
reasonable care, permit it to be committed.
8. In the absence of an express covenant to repair, a tenant is not answerable
for accideiital damages, nor is he bound to rebuild, if buildings are accidentally destroyed by fire 6r otherwise.
4. The destruction of ornamental trees, fences, walls, &c., and the quarrying and
removal of stone and gravel, is voluntary waste, within the prohibition of
the implied agreement, for which the tenant is answerable.
5. In this case, the property having been rented by the United States "1for all purposes," no recovery can be had on account of its use for a small-pox hospital.
6. The obligations of the United States relate to the condition of the premises
at the time the term commenced. For damages done before that time by
the army engaged in the suppression of the rebellion, no action can be maintained in the Court of Claims.
7. The acceptance, without objection by the lessor, of reduced rates of rent after
the expiration of the first year is conclusive evidence of his assent, in consideration of the continued occupancy by the United States, to a modification of the original agreement in that particular.

APPE AL from the Court of Claims.

This was a suit by Thomas R. Lovett, trustee of Mrs. Louisa
Fletcher, against the United States, to recover the rent of and
for damages to certain real estate and premises situated in the
District of Columbia, and known as Kalorama.
The Court of Claims found the following facts :Thomas R. Lovett, as trustee of Mrs. Louisa Fletcher, was, on
the seventeenth day of August, 1861, seised in fee of said premises, containing about ninety-one acres, a dwelling-house with
wings, measuring in all one hundred and fifty by forty feet, a large
stable, and a frame building, with a garden, lawns, and walks,
a fence all around the premises, and a substantial wall, about a
quarter of a mile long, from Rock Creek to the lodge gate on
Boundary Street, and trees of various kinds, and shrubbery.
In consequence of application made to him for the lease of
the premises to the United States for a hospital, by General
Mansfield, Lovett authorized the following writings, marked
1 and 2:-

trees and shrubbery on the grounds shall be strictly protected, and
any unnecessary injury to the same to be compensated for by the

While the United States occupied the premises from Aug. 23,
1861, to Sept. 30, 1867, the main house was burned; the flowergarden and shrubbery were destroyed; three and one-half miles
of fence torn down; a brick wall fifty feet long, nine feet high,
and fourteen inches thick torn down, and the bricks used, partly
for pavement and partly for building a lime-house, where the
United States put clothes for purifying them. Some sheds were
torn down. The part of the house not burned, about fifty feet
long, was greatly damaged, and the glass, with the sashes, was
carried away. Ornamental and shade trees of various kinds
were cut down; a stone wall was taken down, and most of it
carried away; and stone quarried and gravel dug from a quarry
and a gravel-pit on the premises, and carried away. The premises were left in a dilapidated condition, and the house unfit
for occupancy. To restore the building and premises to their
condition when leased, reasonable wear and tear excepted, would
have cost $20,000.

'Kalorama,' in this city, and for gravel, stone, &c., stated at
$32,493.25, referred to this office from the War Department for
further report, in connection with the additional evidence presented, and to invite your attention to the full abstract of the case
herein.
"I consider the order of General Mansfield taking possession,
and directing a monthly payment of $500, and the fact of the
claimant receiving and receipting for this amount, sufficient evidence of a contract or lease, and therefore recommend that rent
be paid from Aug. 23, 1861, to Oct, 1, 1867, 73 months, 8 days, at
$500 per month, amounting to $36,633.38, subject to the deduction
of all sums which were paid the claimant for the use of the premises
during United States occupancy.
"It is evident from the abstract that injustice was done the
claimant in the previous recommendation of Acting Quartermaster-General Rucker, as to the allowance for gravel taken and
used.
"I recommend that Mr. Lovett be paid for 2,777 yards (60,250
bushels) of gravel, at the same rate as that allowed by the War

This report being examined by an officer of the War Department, he made a report to the Secretary, concluding with
the following recommendation :"As to the items mentioned in Mr. Lovett's proposition as being
in the house, a fire-proof safe, copper boiler, hall-stove, &c., and for
which an aggregate charge of $218 is made, Messrs. Allen and
Yeatman say that they are unable to determine whether the
responsibility for these rests with the Quartermaster's or Medical
Department, and the Quartermaster-General does not ask authority
to pay them. It is considered, however, that, the responsibility of
the Medical Department being a matter of doubt, they should be
paid for by the same Department as the rest.
"It is recommended, therefore, that the Acting QuartermasterGeneral be directed to make the payments recommended in his
letter of Nov. 11, 1869, and to pay, in addition, the sum of $218
for the items last referred to."
Upon which the Secretary of War indorsed as follows : "Approved :

UNITD STATES v. BoSTWICK.

WArR delivered the opinion of the
court.
In'the determination of this cause, it is necessary at the outset to ascertain definitely the terms of the contract under which
the United States occupied the property of the petitioner. On
the one hand, it is claimed that the proposition of Mr. Lovett
was accepted by General Mansfield with modifications, and that
all the stipulations suggested by him are included in the contract as finally entered into, unless modified or rejected in terms
by the note of General Mansfield. On the other hand, it is
contended by the United States that the note of General Mansfield, instead of being an acceptance of the proposition, was
a rejection of it, with an offer of new terms, which, when acceded to by Mr. Lovet, embraced all there was of the contract
as made. The latter, we think, is the true construction of the
correspondence. We know that, when a contract is entered
into by correspondence, the whole correspondence must be considered in determining what the parties have agreed to; but we
also know that both parties must assent to a proposed agreement before either is bound by it. Here General Mansfield
has nowhere indicated a willingness to accept any of the terms
offered him, but, rejecting all, has made a new offer of his own.
No reference whatever is made by him to any of the special
stipulations suggested by Mr. Lovett. All these are laid aside,
and he states the terms upon which the United States will hire
the property. The words "as above," where they ,ccur in his
note, are used to designate the property, not to extend the offer.
In short, Mr. Lovett proposed his terms, and General Mansfield
his. Mansfield's were accepted, but Lovett's were not.
This being the case, the contract is one by which Mr. Lovett
agreed to let, and the United States to hire, the premises described for the term of one year, vith the privilege of three, at
a rent of $500 a month, and without restriction as to the use
to which the property might be put. The United States agree
to nothing in express. terms, except to pay rent and hold for
one year..
, But in every lease there is, unless excluded by the operation
of somd express covenant or agreement, an implied obligation
on the part of the lessee to so use the property as not unneces.

sarily to injure it, or, as it is stated by Mr. Comyn, "to treat the
premises demised in such manner that no injury be done to the
inheritance, but that the estate may revert to the lessor undeteriorated by the wilful or negligent conduct of the lessee."

language. It results from the relation of landlord and tenant
between the parties which the contract creates. Eoiford v.

Brown v. Crump, 1 Marsh. 569.
There are in this contract no stipulations to take the place
of or in any manner restrict this implied obligation on the part
of the United States growing out of their relation to the petitioner as his lessees. They had the free and unrestricted right
to use the property for any and all purposes, but were bound to
so conduct themselves in such use as not to cause unnecessary
injury. Whatever damages would necessarily result from a
use for the same purpose by a good tenant must fall upon the
lessor. All that the relation of landlord and tenant implies in
this particular is, that the tenant, while using the property, will
exercise reasonable care to prevent damage to the inheritance.
His obligation rests upon the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum
non ldas If he fails in this, he violates his contract, and
must respond accordingly.
The United States, when they contract with their cititens, are
controlled by the same laws that govern the citizen in that behalf. All obligations which would be implied against citizens
under the same circumstances will be implied against them.
No lease in form was ever executed in this case; but the contract, followed by the delivery of possession and occupation
under it, is equivalent for the purposes of this action to a lease
duly executed, containing all the stipulations agreed upon.
Such being the agreement of the parties, it remains only to
consider the questions arising under it, as they appear in the
record.
1. As to the rent. The United States hired for a year absolutely, at the agreed rent of $500 a month, and occupied during

the whole of that term. They therefore, by their agreement,
were expressly bound to pay rent at that rate for the whole of
the year. This they have paid ii full to June 30; but after
that, until the end of the year, Aug. 23, 1862, their payments
have been only at the rate of $250 a month. Payment by a
debtor of a part of his debt is not a satisfaction of the whole,
except it be made and accepted upon some new consideration.
It is not found that there was any new consideration in this
case. All that appears is, that an accoiint was made out for
the rent from July 1 to Sept. 30, at the new rate, and that
ihis account was receipted by Mr. Lovett after payment.
Upon this finding, therefore, in the absence of any thing more,
showing that the reduction in the rent of the first year was
part of the agreement to continue the lease beyond the year
upon new terms, the petitioner will be entitled to judgment for
rent at the rate of $250 a month, from June 30 to Aug. 23,
1862, that being the balance remaining after deducting payments made.
After the end of the first year the case is different. The
United States were not bound absolutely to keep the premises
for a longer term than one year. After that, they could make
new terms, or leave. The acceptance by Mr. Lovett of the
reduced rates from that time, without objection, is conclusive
evidence of his assent to a modification of the original agreemen t in this particular, in consideration of the continued
occupancy by the United States. Having thus secured the
occupancy, he cannot now object to the agreement under which
it was obtained.
2. As to the use for a small-pox hospital. Mr. Lovett originally offered the property to the government 11for the purposes of-a hospital;" and all the receipts for the rent expressly
state that the property was being so occupied. No objection to
such an occupaqncy was ever made; and, if there were nothing
more, the presumption would be that the lessor expected the
property was to be used for any and all hospital purposes that
the necessities of the government for the time being might require. But the note of General Mansfield is broad enough to
cover such an occupancy, for he expressly states that the hiring
is to be "for all purposes." No recovery can be had upon this
specification of claim.

3. As to the destruction of a part of the buildings by fire.
There was, as has been seen, no express' agreement to repair in
the lease. The implied obligation is not to repair generally,
but to so use the property as to make repairs unnecessary, as
far as possible. It is in effect a covenant against voluntary
waste, and nothing more. It has never been so construed as to
make a tenant answerable for accidental damages, or to bind
him to rebuild, if the buildings are burned down or otherwise
destroyed by accident. In this case it has not been found,
neither is it claimed in the petition, that these premises were
burned through the neglect of the United States. No judgment can, therefore, be rendered against the United States on
this account.
4. The destruction of the trees and fences, and the digging
and carrying away of gravel and stone. Whatever injury was
done to the property during the occupation previous to the
agreement for the lease cannot be recovered for in this action.
Mr. Lovett's proposition included an undertaking on the part
of the United States to make good this loss; but his proposition
was not accepted, and the case stands as if it had never been
made. The obligations of the United States under the lease, as
to the preservation of the property, relate only to the condition
of the premises as it was when the term commenced. All damage done before that is clearly "damages . . . by the army
and navy . . .engaged in the suppression of the rebellion,"
and on that account not recoverable in the Court of Claims.
13 Stat. 381. But damage after the lease commenced, and
while the United States were actually in possession under it,
occupies a different position. That comes within the contract
by which the rights of the parties in this action are to be determined, As has been seen, that does not bind the United States
to make good any loss which necessarily results from the use
of the property, but only such as results from the want of reasonable care in the use. It binds them not to commit waste, or
suffer it to be committed. If they fail in this, they fail in the
performance of their contract, and are answerable for that in
the Court of Claims, which has jurisdiction of "all claims
founded upon any contract, express or implied, with the government of the United States, which may be suggested to it by a

Oct. 1876.]

UNITED STATES v. BoSTWICK.

petition filed therein." Rev. Stat. Â§ 1059; 10 Stat. 612, Â§ 1. If
there had been in this lease an express agreement to repair,
certainly it could not have been successfully claimed that the
Court of Claims would not have had jurisdiction to award
damages fox a failure to rebuild after the fire, even though the
fire was cqused by the soldiers while in the hospital for treatmen b. But the implied obligation as to the manner of the use
is as much obligatory upon the United States as -it would be if
it had been expressed. If there is a failure to comply with the
agreement in this particular, it is a breach of the contract, for
which the United States consent to be sued in the Court of
Claims. All depends upon the contract. Without that, the
jurisdiction does not include actions for damages by the army;
with it, damages contracted against may be recovered as for a
breach of the contract.
It appears in the finding that during the occupancy under
the lease ornamental trees were destroyed; fences and walls
torn down, and the materials used for sidewalks and the erection of other buildings, or carried away; and that stone was
quarried and gravel dug from a stone-quarry and gravel-pit on
the premises, and taken away. This was voluntary waste, and
within the prohibition of the implied agreement in the lease.
For this the Court of Claims can award compensation in this
action. The amount of this damage has not been found
5. The account, as stated in the quartermaster-general's office.
This does not conclude the United States. It was a*mere adjustment of the accounts by one of the bureaus in one of the
departments of the government, rejected by the accounting
officers of the treasury, and never paid. Certainly this can
have no binding effect upon the United States.
The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded,
with instructions to render judgment against the Unite&States
for the rent of the premises from June 80 to Aug. 28, 1862, at
the rate of $250 per month, and for the damages done to the
property other than the destruction of the house by fire during
the occupation of the United States under their lease, except
to the extent that the same necessarily resulted from the use
of the premises by the soldiers of the army of the United States
for the purposes of a hospital and camp-ground, and it is
So ordered.
