Better proof to show that persons claiming title to the premises were notified that her possession was adverse and hostile to
their claim can hardly be imagined than what is exhibited in
the case before the court. Thirty years before the present suit
was commenced, a common-law action of ejectment was instituted for the same premises, in which the father and the grantors
of the plaintiffs were described as the lessors of the fictitious
plaintiff in the suit, and it appears that the suit was defeated
by the testatrix of the defendant, aided by her second husband,
then in full life.
Viewed in any light, we are all of the opinion that there is no

Judgment affirmed.

COCnRAN- v. DEENE .
1. The powers and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia,
in patent cases, are the same, as well in equity as at law, as those of the
circuit courts of the United States; and whether a case, involving the validity or the infringement of letters-patent, shall be first tried at law is a matter
of discretion and not of jurisdiction.
2. The improvement in processes for manufacturing flour, for which reissued letters-patent No. 6,841 were granted to William F. Cochrane and his assigneea,
April 21, 1874, being a reissue of letters-patent No. 37,817, granted to him
Jan. 6, 1863, does not consist in using drafts or currents of air, but in the
process as a whole, comprising the application of the blast, and the carrying
off the fine impurities whereby the middlings, after being separated from
the other parts, are purified, preparatory to regrinding.
8. A process may be patentable, irrespective of the particular form of the instrumentalities used. If one of the steps of a process be that a certain substance
is to be reduced to a powder, it may not be at all material what instrument
or machinery is used to effect that object, whether a hammer, a pestle and
mortar, or a mill. Either may be pointed out; but, if the patent is not confined to that particular tool or machine, the use of the other would be an
intringement, the general process being the same.
4. A process is a mcde of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result.
It is an act or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter, to be
transformed and reduced to a different state or thing. If new and useful, it
is just as patentable as a piece of machinery. In the language of the patent
law, it is an art.

O CHRANE v. DEENER.

5. The machinery pointed out as suitable to perform the-process may or may not
be new or patentable, whilst the process itself may be altogether new, and
produce an entirely new result. The process requires that certain things
should be done with certain substances, and in a certain order; but the tools
to be used in doing this may be of secondary consequence.
6. The court holds that reissued letters-patent No. 5,841, bearing date April 21,
1874, for improvements in processes for manufacturing flour; No. 6,030, bearing date Aug. 24, 1870; No. 6,594 and No. 6,595, bearing date Aug. 17, 1875,
for improvements in machines for bolting flour, and issued to William F.
Cochrane and his assignees,-are valid, and were infringed by the defendants,
in using machines constructed according to reissued letters-patent No. 5,346,
bearing date April 1,1873, being a reissue of letters-patent No. 135,953, bearing date Feb. 18, 1878, and granted to Edward P. Welch and his assignees,
for improvements in middlings-purifiers, and being for improvements upon
machines patented to Jesse B. Wheeler and Ransom S. Reynolds; but that
letters-patent No. 37,319 and No. 37,320, bearing date Jan. 6, 1863, issued to
said Cochrane, for improvements in bolting flour, were not infringed.

delivered the opinion of the court.
M. JUSTICE BRn
This is a suit in equity, instituted in the Supreme Court of
the District of Columbia for injunction and relief against an
alleged infringement of various patents belonging to the complainants. The bill was dismissed, and the complainants have
appealed.
The patents sued on are six in number, originally five, granted
to the appellant Cochrane on the 13th of January, 1863, and
numbered respectively 37,817, 87,318, 37,819, 37,320, and
37,321. They all related to an improved method of bolting
flour, the first being for the general process, and the others for
improvements in the different parts of the machinery rendered
necessary in carrying on the process. Three of the original
patents, Nos. 37,817, 87,318, and 37,321, were surrendered, and
reissues taken in 1874, which reissues were numbered 5,841,
6,029, and 6,080, the first being for the process, and the other
two for portions of the machinery. Reissue 6,029, being in
place of the original patent numbered 37,321, was also subse-

COCHRANE v. DEENER.

[Sup. Ot.

quently surrendered, and two new reissued patents substituted
therefor, numbered 6,594 and 6,595.
The case has been mainly argued on the question of infringpment, the defendants using a bolting apparatus constructed
according to letters-patent issued to Edward P. Welch in April,
1873, for improvements upon machines patented to Jesse B.
Wheeler and Ransom S. Reynolds, which, as well as the process employed, they contend, are radically different from the
apparatus and process of Cochrane.
A preliminary question is raised with regard to the jurisdiction of the court below to hear the case on a bill in equity,
before a determination of the rights of the parties in an action
at law.
The powers of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia in patent cases are the same as those of the circuit courts
of the United States. See Revised Statutes relating to the
District of Columbia, sects. 760, 764.
The circuit courts were first invested with equity jurisdiction
in patent cases by the act of Feb. 15, 1819, which declared that
these courts should have IIoriginal cognizance, as well in equity
as at law, of all actions, suits, controversies, and cases arising
under any law of the United States, granting or confirming to
authors or inventors the exclusive right to their respective
writings, inventions, and discoveries; and upon any bill in
equity, filed by any party aggrieved in any such cases, should
have authority to grant injunctions, according to the course and
principles of courts of equity," &c.
This law was substantially re-enacted in the seventeenth section of the patent law of July 4,1836, and the fifty-fifth section
of that of July 8, 1870, special powers to assess damages in
equity cases being also conferred by the latter act.
Before the act of 1819 was passed, the circuit courts had
cognizance of actions at law brought to recover damages for
the infringement of patents, but not of suits in equity in relation thereto, unless the parties happened to be citizens of different States. Phillips on Pat. 379; Livingston v. Van Ingen,
1 Paine, 54; Sullivan v. Redfield, id. 447. Under that act
and the subsequent acts in which it became incorporated, bills
in equity for injrnction, discovery, and account have constantly

Oct. 1876.]

]COCHRANE

v. DEENER.

been sustained, frequently without any previous action at law.
As said by Mr. Justice Grier, in a case decided at the circuit,
"It is true that, in England, the chancellor will generally not
grant a final and perpetual injunction in patent cases, when the
answer denies the validity of the patent, without sending the
parties to law to have that question decided. But even there
the rule is not universal: it is a practice founded more on convenience than necessity. It always rests in the sound discretion of the court. A trial at law is ordered by a chancellor to
inform his conscience, .not because either party may demand it
as a right, or that a court of equity is incompetent to judge of
questions of fact or of legal titles. In the United States, the
practice is by no means so general as in England." Goodyear
v. Day, 2 Wall. Jr. 296. Subsequently, in the case of ickles
v. Gloucester Manufacturing Co., 3 id. 196, the same judge
said: "The courts of the United States have their jurisdiction
over controversies of this nature by statute, and do not exercise
it merely as ancillary to a court of law."' And, afier quoting
the statute, he proceeds: "Having such original cognizance,
.. . the courts of the United States do not, in all cases, require
a verdict at law on the title, before granting a final injunction,
or concede a right to every party to have every issue as to
originality or infringement tried by a jury."
The position of Mr. Justice Grier is undoubtedly true, that
whether a case shall be first tried at law is 'a matter of discretion, and not of jurisdiction; and in this matter the courts of
the United States, sitting as courts of equity in patent cases,
are much less disposed than the English courts are to"send parties to a jury before assuming to decide upon the merits.
But the counsel for the defendants suggest that the Revised
Statutes have not preserved in entirety the previous enactments
on this subject, but have omitted the vesting of original cognizance in the circuit courts sitting as courts of equity in pateut
cases. From a careful consideration, however, of all the sections of the Revised Statutes on the subject, we think that no
intention is evinced to 3hake any change in the law. The original enactments are separated into distinct parts, and somewhat
condensed; but the subststice'of them is retained. By sect.
629, the circuit courts are invested with jurisdiction, among

Coci AE v. DEE.Sp

[Sup. Or.

other things, "Ninth, of all suits at law or in equity arising
under the patent or copyright laws of the United States."
And, by sect. 4921, it is declared, that "the several courts
vested with jurisdiction of cases arising under the patent laws
shall have power to grant injunctions according to the course
and principles of courts of equity," &c., following precisely the
language used in th%. act of 1870, the last previous revision of
this branch of the law. The grant of jurisdiction is as broad
and general as it could well be, and the mode of exercising
it is prescribed in precisely the same terms as in previous
statutes.
In the present case, we see no special reason for sending the
case to a court of law or to a jury for trial. There are no such
issues depending upon the credibility of witnesses, or on the
intricacy of machinery, as to make the case susceptible of easier
solution or greater certainty as to the truth before such a tribunal than it admits of when presented to the consideration of
a chancellor. It would, perhaps, be desirable if all cases of this
sort could be referred to a commission of intelligent experts
and practical men to report their opinion thereon, with their
reasons, for the final action of the court. A proceeding of this
kind was probably in the mind of Congress in passing the act
of Feb. 16, 1875, authorizing a reference to a jury of five persons. Neither courts nor ordinary juries are perfectly adapted
to the investigation of mechanical and scientific questions. .The
court below, however, exercised its discretion to decide the case
upon its merits, without the aid of a jury of any sort, and their
action is not a ground of appeal. If we were convinced, however, that the case was not properly decided, and could not be
properly decided without such a reference, we might undoubtedly, in the exercise of our own discretion, remand it to the
court below for that purpose. But we see nothing in the questions raised which require that such a course should be adopted.
The principal patent sued on in this case was granted on the
21st of April, 1874, being a reipsue of a patent granted to
William F. Cochrane on the 6th of January, 1863. The original patent was numbered 37,317, and the reissue 5,841. The
alleged invention is for a process in manufacturing flour. The
patentee, in his specification, says: "The object of my inven-

Oct. 1876.]

Cocwwa

tion was to increase the production of the best quality of flour;
and my improvement consisted in separating from the meal
first the superfine flour, and then the pulverulent impurities
mingled with the flour-producing portions of the middlingsmeal, so as to make 'white' or 'purified' middlings, which,
when reground and rebolted, would yield pure white flour,
which, when added to the superfine, would improve the quality
of he flour resulting from their union, instead of deteriorating
its quality, as had heretofore been the case when the middlings
flour was mingled with the superfine." The process employed
for producing the result here indicated is then described. It
consists in passing the ground meal through a series of boltingreels clothed with cloth of progressively finer meshes, which
pass the superfine flour and retard the escape of the finer and
lighter impurities; and, at the same time, subjecting the meal
to blasts or currents of air introduced by hollow perforated
shafts furnished with pipes so disposed that the force of the
blast may act close to the surface of the bolting-cloth; the
bolting-chest having an opening at the top for the escape of
the air, and of the finer and lighter particles therewith, through
a chamber where the particles are arrested, whilst the floor and
sides of each compartment of the chest are made close, so as to
prevent the escape of the air in any otherdirection than through
the said opening. By this means, the superfine flour is separated,
and the fine and light specks and.impurities, which ordinarily
adhere fo the mizdlings and degrade the flour produced therefrom, are got rid of; and when the middlings are now separated from the other portions of the meal, they are white and
clean, and capable of being, reground and rebolted, so as to
produce superfine flour equal in quality and even superior to
the first instalment.

This is the p ocess described; but 'the patentee claims that
it is not limited to any special arrangement of machinery. He
admits the prior use of' currents of air in the interior of the
reels, introduced by means of hollow, perforated shafts, for the
purpose of keeping back the speck, and increasing ° the quantity
of superfine flour; but not for purifying the middlings preparatory to regrinding. His improvement, therefore, does not consist in using drafts and currents of air, but in the process as a

[Sup. Ot.

whole, comprising the application of the blast, and the carrying off of the fine impurities, whereby the middlings are purified
preparatory to regrinding after being separated from the other
parts.
The defendants deny that they use this process. They
purify the middlings of the flour, as before stated, by means
of machines constructed according to letters-patent issued to
Edward P. Welch, in April, 1873, for improvements upon
machines patented to Jesse B. Wheeler and Ransom S. Rey
nolds.
In this process, reels are not used for purifying the middlings,
but a flat and slightly inclined vibrating screen or sieve is used
for the purpose; over which the ground meal is passed, and
whilst passing is subjected to currents of air blown through a
series of pipes situated close underneath the screen; which
currents pass up through the screen and through an opening at
the top of the chest into a chamber, carrying-with them the
finer and lighter impurities, whereby the middlings are rendered clean and white, and capable of being reground into
superfine flour. The bolting-chest is made tight and close on
all sides except the opening at the top, so that the currents of
air may be forced to escape by that exit.
Now, except in the use of a flat sieve or screen in place of
reels, it is difficult to see any substantial difference between
these two methods. The defendants use, in addition, brushes,
which revolve on the under side of the screen, so as to keep the
meshes thereof constantly clean and free; but this is merely
an addition, which does not affect the identity of the two processes in other particulars. We have substantially the same
method of cleaning the middlings preparatory to regrinding by
means of currents of air passed through them whilst being
bolted, and whilst being confined in a close chest or chamber,
said chamber having an opening above for the escape of said
currents of air and the impurities with which they become
loaded. The middlings being thus purified are reground and
rebolted, producing a superfine flour of superior grade, - a new,
useful, and highly valuable result.
The use of a flat screen instead of a revolving reel for bolting and cleaning the middlings is a mere matter of form. It

Oct. 1876.]

cOCRAxE b. Dmnm.

may be an improved form, and, perhaps, patentable as an
improvement; but it is at most an improvement.
The forcing of the air-currents upward through the screen
and film of meal carried on it and against the downward fall of
the meal, instead of forcing them through the bolting-cloth in
the same direction with the meal, is also a mere matter of
form, and does not belong to the substance of the process. The
substantial operation of the currents of air in both cases is to
take up the light impurities and bear them away on the aggregate current through the open flue, and thus to separate them
from the middlings. This, too, may bb -n improvement on
Cochrane's method; but it is only an improvement.
The defendants admit that the process has produced a revolution in the manufacture of flour; but they attribute that
revolution to their improvements. It may be as they say, that
it is greatly due to these. But it cannot be seriously denied
that Cochrane's invention lies at the bottom of these improvements, is involved in them, and was itself capable of beneficial
use, and was put to such use. It had all the elements and circumstances necessary for sustaining the patent, and cannot be
appropriated by the defendants, even though supplemented by
and enveloped in very important and material 'improvements
of their own.
We do not perceive that the patent of Cogswell and McKiernan, if valid at all as against Cochrane (a point which will
be more fully considered hereafter), affects the question in the
least. That patent is not at all for the process which Cochrane claims. If valid, and if, in using his process, Cochrane is
obliged to use any device secured to Cogswell and McKiernan,
it does not detract in the slightest degree from his own patent.
One invention may include within it -many others, and each
and all may be valid at the same time. This only consequence
follows, that -each inventor is precluded from using inventions
made and patented prior to his own, except by license from the
owners thereof. His invention and his patent are equally
entitled to protection frbm infringement, as if they were independent of any connection with them.
That a process may be patentable, irrespective of the particulax form of the in.0rumeutalities used, cannot hedis]umred. If

COCHRANE

[Sup. Ct.

one of the steps of a process be that a certain substance is to be
reduced to a powder, it may not be at all material whatinstru
ment or machinery is used to effect that object, whether a
hammer, a pestle and mortar, or a mill. Either may be
pointed out; but if the patent is not confined to that particular
tool or machine, the use of the others would be an infringement, the general process being the same. A process is a
mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given
result. It is an -act, or a series of acts, performed upon the
subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different
state or thing. If new and useful, it is just as patentable as is
a piece of machinbry. In the language of the patent law, it is
an art. The machinery pointed out as suitable to perform the
process may or may not be new or patentable; whilst the process itself may be altogether new, and produce an entirely new
result. The process requires that certain things should be
done with certain substances, and in a certain order; but the
tools to be used in doing this may be of secondary consequence.
The machine patents come next to be considered.
As to number 6,030, which is a reissue of the original patent
number 37,318, the defendants clearly infringe, at least, the last
claim, which 'is in these words: "In combination with the
screen incased in a chest, the perforated blast-pipe and the suction-pipe, arranged to operate on opposite sides of the screen,
substantially as set forth."
As to the patent next in order, namely, the original patent
number 37,319, which relates specially to the use of what the
patentee 6alls the pump for introducing the meal into the chest
and reels. whilst the valve arrangement used by the defendants
may be an equivalent in the general combination with the said
pump described by Cochrane, yet, taken by themselves, as
separate pieces of machinery, they are not the same, and the
use of the one is not an infringement of a patent for the other.
Curtis, sect. 382; Foster v. Moore, 1 Curtis, C. Q. 279. Nor
can we perceive that the defendants infringe the next patent,
number 37,320, which is for certain combinations of machinery,
including the bolting-reels,' dead-air' chambers therein, slotted
shaift, and reciprocating board for discharging the meal, &c.,
which it is unnecessary to describe moie particularly.

6OCHRANE v. DEENER.

The two remaining patents, numbered 6,594 and Q,595, being
reissues of original patent number 37,321, are for combinations
of essential parts of the machinery required for bolting flour
and purifying the middlings according to the general process
described in the first patent. The principal claim of the original patent was for the condensing or collecting chamber,
through which the currents of air, on leaving the bolting-chest,
make their escape, and where they leave the fine particles with
which they become loaded. This claim, it is said, was found
to be too broad, inasmuch as a collecting chamber, somewhat
similar, had been used in another connection, though not in the
combinations presented in Cochrane's bolting process. The
original patent, therefore, was surrendered, and the two patents
now under consideration were issued in place thereof, claiming
the use of the collecting chamber in combination with the various material parts of the bolting apparatus. The reissue,
number 6,594, contains three claims, and number 6,595, one
claim.
The first claim of reissue number 6,594 is for the collecting
chamber (used for the purpose aforesaid) in combination with
the bolter, air-pipes, and valves for feeding and delivering the
meal without allowing the air to pass therewith. Now, although
the defendants use a flat bolter instead of a reel, and use different
kinds of valves for feeding and delivering the meal without
allowing the air to pass, yet they employ the combination of
devices described in this claim. They use the collectingchamber for the same purpose as that pointed out in the patent,
and use it in connection with a bolter, air-pipes, and valves
for feeding and delivering the meal without allowing the air
to pass therewith, each effecting the same separate purpose,
and all combined effecting the same general purpose, which
the like parts are intended to accomplish in Cochrane's bolting
apparatus. Though some of the corresponding parts of the
machinery, designated in this combination, are not the same
in point 6f form in the two bolting apparatuses, and, separately considered, could not be regarded as identical or conflicting, yet having the same purpose in the combination, and
effecting that purpose in substantially the same manner, they
are the equivalents of each ofher in that regard.. The claim

COCHRANE V. DEENER.

[Sup. Ot.

of the patent is not confined to any particular form of appa
ratus, but (in regard to the valves, for example) embraces generally any valves for.feeding and delivering the meal without
allowing the air to pass through. We are of opinion, therefore, that the combination here claimed ii infringed by the
apparatus used by the dtfencjants.
It is unnecessary to make a separate examination of the
other claims embraced in the two patents under consideration.
They are all susceptible of the same observations which we
have made with regard. to the first claim. In our opinion, the
defendants do infringe them.
But a question is raised with regard to Cochrane's priority
of invention. A patent was granted on the 12th of June,
1860, to Mortimer C. Cogswell and John McKiernan for improvements in ventilated bolting-chests, which, it is contended,
antedates and nullifies Cochrane's apparatus as patented to
him in the original patent 87,321, and in the two reissues
"thereot before mentioned. This patent (of Cogswell and
MeKiernan) we have examined, and find that it does contain
five of the elements embraced in those reissues; namely (besides the bolting-chest and bolter, which are always used), it
contains the perforated air-pipe extending inside of the boltingreel, the fan for producing a blast of air therein, and a collecting-chamber for arresting the flour carried off by the blast.
The purpose was simply to cool the meal and keep the boltingcloths dry. The flour which collected in the chamber was
returned to the chest. The parts contained in this apparatus
are those which are patented in combination in Cochrane's
reissue 6,595, which was separated, it is said, from reissue
6,594 on account of this patent of Cogswell and McKiernan.
The combinations patented in reissue 6,594 embrace other
parts not contained in, Cogswell and McKiernan's patent; and
the defendants contend that this reissue is void, as not being
sustained by the'original patent 37,321.
The latter position, we think, is untenable. Cochrane's apparatus, as exhibited in his model, and described in his original
patent, and in the series of patents taken out at the same time,
all having relation to the same general process, and referred to
in patent 87,321, contained all the parts which go to make the

,Oct. 1876.]

COCHRANE

v. DEENER.

combination claimed in reissue number 6,594. We see no
reason, therefore, why such reissue was not properly granted
to him by the Patent Office, the claim being, in fact, a much
narrower one than that of the original patent.
The same observations apply to reissue number 6,595. But,
as to that, as before stated, the particular elements of the combination claimed in it are found in Cogswell and McKiernan's
machine; and if this is entitled to the precedency over Cochrane's, reissue number 6,595 is void. He contends that it is
not entitled to such precedency; but that, in fact, Cogswell
and McKiernan surreptitiously obtained a patent for his inven-"
tion. We have examined the evidence relating to this matter,
and are satisfied that the improvement claimed b.y Cochrane
was his invention; that Cogswell and McKiernan obtained
their knowledge of it from -him; and that there is nothing
connected with their patent which ought to invalidate the reissued patent in question.
A French patent, dated 27th of September, 1860, granted to
one Perigault, is also referred to as anticipating the combinations in these patents. But it being shown that Cochrane's
invention was actually made before that date, the point was
not pressed in the argument. , By the act of 1870, a foreign
patent, in order to invalidate an American patent, must antedate the invention patented.
Our conclusion is, that the patent for the process, being reissue number 5,841, and the several reissued patents for combinations of mechanical devices, numbered respectively 6,030,
6,594, and 6,595, are valid patents, and are infringed by the
defendants; and that the other two patents named in the bill
of complaint, numbered respectively 37,319 and 37,320, are
not infringed by the defendants.
-Decree reversed, and cause remanded with directions to enter
a decree for the complainants, and to proceed therein in
conformity with this opinion.
