HURST v. HOLLINGSWORTH.

HURST V. HOLLGS-WORTH.
Where a party sued out a writ of error, and obtained the allowance of an appeal,
and duly filed a transcript of the record here, the court will not, on motion,
dismiss the cause, but, when it comes on to be heard, will determine whether
it is properly here by appeal or by writ of error, and proceed accordingly.

Ox1 motion.
Mr. JV. P. .Baflingerfor Hurst.
M21r. James Lowndes, contra.
MR. CMF TUSTICE WAM delivered the opinion of the

court.
Hurst, the plaintiff below, being in doubt whether his case
was one to be brought here by appeal or by writ of error, took
the precaution of suing out a writ of error, and also of obtaining the allowance of an appeal. At the proper time he filed
a transcript of the record, and the cause was docketed by the
clerk as upon a writ of error; thereupon the defendant moved'
to docket and dismiss the appeal. Hurst now appears and asks
leave to docket his appeal. The defendant does not object to
this, but, treating it as an election for Hurst to proceed here
-upon the appeal, moves to dismiss the writ of error.
These motions are all denied. There was but one action in
the court below, and there is but one record. When the transcript of that record was brought here by Hurst, his cause was
docketed. It is not necessary to enter it twice, because, out of
abundant caution and to guard against a possible chance of dismissal, he has brought it here in two ways. He has but one
cause; and, when we come to examine it, we will determine
whether it is properly here by appeal or by writ of error, and
will proceed accordingly.
.Motions denied.
