COmmISSIONERS OF DOUGLAS COUNTY

v.

BOLLES,

1. Where a railroad company has been a corporation de facto from the date of
its organization, its existence and its ability to contract cannot be called in
question in a suit brought upon evidences of debt given to it.
2. Under the act of the legislature of Kansas, to authorize counties and cities to
issue bonds to railroad companies, approved April 10, 1865, and that of Feb.
25, 1868, the board of commissioners of a county is authorized to determine
whether the condition precedent to the lawful issue of such bonds has been
complied with.
8. A recital by the board in the bonds, showing that such condition has been
complied with, is, when they are in the hands of a bona fide holder for value,
binding upon the county; and he is bound to look !or nothing behind the
recital except legislative authority for the issue of them.

E.RRoR to the Circuit Court of the United States for the
District of Kansas.
This was an action by Matthew Bolles and M. Shepard
Bolles against the board of county commissioners of the county
of Douglas, Kansas, upon sundry coupons attached to certain
bonds issued by the county. The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
The following questions of law arose, upon which the judges
of the court below were divided in opinion 1. Whether, as respects the bonds dated July 1, 1869, and
the coupons in suit originally attached to said bonds, there was
authority and power in the board of county commissioners of
the county to issue said bonds under the act of Feb. 10, 1865,
recited in the bonds and other acts of the legislature of the
State of Kansas, including the act of Feb. 25, 1868.
2. Whether the bonds mentioned in the preceding question
are void in thu hands of a holder for value without actual

notice, because the vote on the question of subscribing stock
and issuing bonds was had Sept. 12, 1865, before the organiza,
tion of the dompany known as the St. Louis, Lawrence, and
Denver Railroad Company was made in 1868, to which company the stock wds subscribed in 1868, and the bonds were
issued and delivered in 1871.
3. Said bonds having been issued upon the facts as found,
was the issue of them illegal and invalid in such a sense as to
devolve upon the plaintiffs the burden of showing that they, or
those whom they represented, were holders of them for value?
4. Whether, as respects the bonds dated July 1, 1872, and
the coupons in suit originally attached to said bonds, there was
power and authority in the board of county commissioners of
the county to issue the same.
5. Whether, upon the facts found, said bonds and coupons
last named are void in the hands of a holder for value without
actual notice of the orders for and facts connected with the
election therefor, and with the organization of the said rail
road company.
6. Said bonds having been issued under the facts as found,
was the issue of them illegal and invalid in such a sense as to
devolve upon the plaintiffs the burden of showing that they, or
those whom they represented, were purchasers or holders of
them for value?
7. Whether the facts found constitute or show a defence to
the bonds of July 1, 1869, or the said bonds of July 1, 1872,
the said bonds or coupons attached thereto in suit being in the
hands of the plaintiffs, without affirmative proof that they were
holders thereof for value without notice of said facts.
There was a judgment for the plaintiffs below; whereupon
the defendants brought the case here.
Submitted on printed arguments by Mr. William . .evison
for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. John S. Abbott, contra.
MR. JUSTICE STRONG delivered the opinion of th- court.
Whether the St. Louis, Lawrence, and Denver Railroad Company was lawfully a corporation, capable of contracting with
the defendants below, is a question that cann6t be raised in
this case. The findings of the Circuit Court establish that a

[Sup. Ot.

majority of the persons named as corporators in the certificate
filed in the office of the secretary of state on the eleventh day of
May, 1868, published a notice that books would be opened on
a designated day for subscriptions to the stock of the company.
The books were accordingly opened, subscriptions to the capital stock were made, a meeting of the stockholders ensued, and
directors were chosen, together with a president, vice-president,
secretary, treasurer, and an executive committee. This was on
the 28th of July, 1868; and from that time corporate meetings
have been regularly held, and the company has built and operated a railroad from Lawrence to the Missouri State line, and
has exercised the usual functions of a railroad corporation. It
has been a corporation de facto, at least, if not de jure, from
the date of its organization. Its corporate existence, therefore,
and its ability to contract cannot be called in question in a suit
brought upon eiidences of debt given to it.
It was after the organization of the company that the defendants subscribed, on behalf of Douglas County, for $125,000 of its
capital stock, stipulating that the subscription should be paid
with the county bonds, payable to bearer in thirty years, and
that the stock and bonds should be issued and delivered when
the railroad should be completed and in full operation from
Lawrence to the eastern boundary of Douglas County. The
road was thus completed and put in operation; the county received the $125,000 of stock; and the bonds were sold by
the railroad company to the contractor for building the road,
and, after its completion, delivered to him by direction of the
defendants.
The bonds were executed by the board of county commissioners of the county of Douglas, who by law are constituted
the financial agents of the county. They were made payable
to bearer, and each contains the following recital: "This bond
is executed and issued by virtue of and ina-cordance with the
act of the legislature of the State of Kansas, entitled IAn Act
to authorize counties and cities to issue bonds to railroad companies,' approved April 10, 1865, and the other laws of said
State, and in pursuance of and in accordance with the vote of
a majority of the qualified electors of said county of Douglas,
at a special election, regularly called and held on Sept. 12,
1865."

COMMSSIoNES, ETC., v. BoLLEs.

This recital, it will be perceived, asserts legislative authority
for the issue of the bonds, found in the statute of April 10,
1865, and other laws of the State. Referring to the act of
1865, it is there enacted. that the "board of county commissioners of any county to, into, through, from, or near which, whether
in this or any other State, any railroad is or may be located,
may subscribe to the capital stock of any such railroad corporation, in the name and for the benefit of the county, not exceeding in amount the sum of $300,000 in any one corporation, and
may issue the bonds of said county in such amounts as they may
deem best, in payment for said stocks, provided that said bonds
shall be issued only in payment of assessments made upon all
the stocks of such railroad company, which bonds shall bear
interest at a rate not exceeding seven per cent per annum, and
shall be payable within thirty years. But no such bonds shall
be issued until the question shall be first submitted to a vote of
the qualified electors of the county at some general election or
at some special election to be called by the board of county commissioners, . . . and, in submitting such question, said board
of commissioners shall direct in what manner the ballot shall
be cast. If a majority of the votes cast at such election shall be
in favor of issuing such bonds, the board of commissioners of
the county shall issue the same." Stats. of Kansas, 1865, p. 41.
This statute plainly gives to the board plenary authority to
subscribe for stock of a railroad corporation, and to issue county
bonds in payment of the subscription, though whether such au-thority in any case may be exercised or not is made to depend
upon the collateral question whether the result of a popular
election has indicated an approval of the proposed issue. And
the board of commissioners is the tribunal contemplated by the
laws to determine whether the contingency of fact has occurred,
-a determination necessary to be made preparatory to their
issuing the county bonds.
The act of 1865 was followed by the act of Feb. 25, 1868,
which was in force when the stock subscription above mentioned was made, and when the bonds of Douglas County were
executed and delivered. This later act was even more liberal
in its grants of authority than the former was. It referred to
elections held before its passage, and to irregular elections, which

COMBUSSIONiERS ETC., V. BOLLES.

[Sup. Ct.

might not have been in compliance with the statutes. It
enacted, in substance, that whenever there had been an election
called by the board, at which a majority of the persons voting
had voted in favor of subscribing stock and issuing bonds to
any railroad company or companies, the board might subscribe
and pay the subscription, by issuing to each company the bonds
of the county, whether such orders and elections, or either of
them, had been in compliance with the statutes in such cases
made and provided, or not, or whether the proposition submitted at the election was for the subscription for stock and
issuance of bonds to one or more railroad companies. The purpose of this act was evidently to cure irregularities and invalidities of prior elections, and to enlarge the powers of county
boards. Still, under this act, as under the former, the board
was to judge whether the precedent condition had been complied with in substance. Gen. Stats. of Kansas, 892.
Such, then, having bedn the authority of the board of commissioners of Douglas County when the bonds now under consideration were issued, what must be the effect of the recitals
they contain ? The question has been frequently before us for
decision, and it is no longer open for debate. In the late case
of Town of Coloma v. Eaves, 92 U. S. 484, we considered it
fully, and reviewed many of our former judgments. We there
held that when, by legislative enactment, authority has been
given to a municipality, or to its officers, to subscribe for the
stock of a railroad company, and to issue municipal bonds in
payment, but only on some precedent condition, such as a popular vote favoring the subscription, and where it may be gathered from the enactment that the officers of the municipality
were invested with power to decide whether that condition had
been complied with, their recital that it had been, made in the
bonds issued by them and held by a bona fide purchaser, is conclusive of the fact and binding upon the municipality, for the
recital is itself a decision of the fact by the appointed tribunal.
The recitals we have now before us are that the bonds were
executed and issued not only in virtue of, but in accordance
with, the acts of the legislature, and in pursuance of and in
accordance with the vote of a majority- of the qualified electors
of the county. They are untrue, if the board had not followed

Oct. 1876.]

COMISSIONERS, ETC., v. BOLLES.

the directions of the law, and if there had not been a popular
vote at an election, approving the issue of those bonds. The
truth or falsehood ot the assertion cannot be inquired after here;
for, as we have said, the recitals are practically an annunciation of the judgment of the board, that all the steps required
by the law had been taken.
Behind such a recital, as we have seen, a bona fide holder for
value paid is bound to look for nothing except legislative
authority given for the issue of municipal bonds "to railroad
companies. He is not required to examine whether the conditions upon which such authority may be exercised have been
fulfilled. He may rely upon the decision made by tie tribunal
s lceted by the legislature.
Dt. then, the plaintiffs below stand in the position of bona
fide holders for value paid, and without nobice of any defect or
irregularity in the proceedings anterior to the issue of the
bonds? In view of the findings of the Circuit Court, very
plainly they do. They are the holders of the coupons in suit.
taken from those bonds, some of which they purchased without notice of any defence. The residue of those held by them
are owned by other persons, who deposited them with the plaintiffs for"collection, taking a receipt. There is no evidence when
or ror what consideration those other persons purchased, an d no
evidence of actual notice to them or to the plaintiffs of any of
the facts anterior "to the issue of the bonds. The findings of
the court exhibit no fraud in the inception of the contracts, nor
any thing that casts up6n the holders of the bonds or coupons
the burden of showing that they are bona fide holders for value.
The legal presumption, therefore, is that they are. But the
plaintiffs are not forced to rest upon mere presumption to sup.
port their claim to ba considered as having the rights of purchasers without notice of any defence. They can call to their
aid the fact that their predecessors in ownership were such
purchasers. To the rights of those predecessors they have succeeded. Certainly, the railroad company paid for the bonds
and coupons by giving an equal amount of their stock, which
the county now holds; and nothing in the special facts found
shows that the company knew of any irregularity of fault in
the issue. And still more: the contractor for building the

COMMaISSIONERS, ETC.. v. BOLLES.

[Sup Ct.

railroad received the bonds from the county in payment for his
work, either in whole or in part, after his work had been completed. There is no pretence that he had notice of any thing
that should have made him doubt their validity. Why was he
not a bona fide purchaser for value? The law is undoubted,
that every person succeeding him in the ownership of the bonds
is entitled to stand upon his rights.
It is, therefore, manifest that the plaintiffs have the rights
of bona fide purchasers, even if the burden of showing it be
regarded as resting on them.
What we have said is sufficient to show that the coupons of
the first class of bonds, viz., those dated July 1, 1869, are valid
evidences of debt as between the plaintiffs and the defendants,
and that the former are entitled to a judgment for the amount
of them.
It is unnecessary to remark at length upon the second class
of bonds and coupons, those dated July 1, 1872. The considerations we have suggested respecting the first apply in full
force to the second, and the defendants have no defence to a
suit for their recovery brought by the plaintiffs. The first and
fourth questions certified from the Circuit Court are, therefore,
answered in the affirmative, and the remaining questions in the
negative. This leads to an affirmance of the judgment.
Happily, such a result is in accordance with the plainest justice. The case is not one in which the municipality has
incurred a debt, without securing the object sought by it.
Popular votes approved the issue of the bonds to further the
construction of the railroad, which has been completed, and
which the county now enjoys. The bonds have not been misappropriated or squandered. They have been applied to the
purpose for which they were made. By direction of the county,
they were paid to the contractor who built the road, after his
contract was completed, and, as intended, they have gone into
the hands of remote purchasers. In addition to this, the county
received in exchange for them an equal amount of stock of the
railroad company. So far as appears, it holds that stock still.
It has acted as the owner, by assenting to a consolidation of the
company with another. Common honesty demands that a debt
thus incurred should be paid.
Judgment affirmed.
