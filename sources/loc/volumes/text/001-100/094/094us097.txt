SMITH V.UITED~ STATES.

If he fails to do this he acquires no title, and his invention
or discovery, no matter what it may be, is lost to him, and is
henceforward no more his than if he had never been in any wise
connected with it. It is made, thereupon, as it were by accretion, irrevocably a part of the domain which belongs to the
community at large. The invention here in question is within
this category.
Decree affirmed.

delivered the opinion of the

JUSTICE WAT

court.
It is clearly within our discretion to refuse to hear a criminal
case in error, unless the convicted party, suing out the writ, is
where he can be made to respond to any judgment we may
render. In this case it is admitted that the plaintiff in error
has. escaped, and is not within the control of the cofirt below,
either actually, by being in custody, or constructively, by being
out on bail. If we affirm the judgment, he is not likely to
appear to submit to his sentence. If we reverse it and order a
new trial, he will appear or not, as he may consider most for
his interest. Under such circumstances, we are not inclined to
hear and decide what may prove to be only a moot case.
This cause was docketed here Dec. 29, 1870. In due time
a brief was filed on behalf of the plaintiff in error, and the
cause has been regularly continued at every term since, no one
appearing here in person to represent the plaintiff. At this
term we dismissed the writ, on motion of the United States,
for want of prosecution, but have since reinstated At on motion
of the counsel for the plaintiff in error, who now moves to have
it set down for argument. This motion we deny, and order
