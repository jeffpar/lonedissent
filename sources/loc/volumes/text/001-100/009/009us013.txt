6. Sinnts, for the plaintiffs in error, suggested that
this court must be satisfied by evidence (other than
the declaration) that the sum in demand exceeded
100 dollars, exclusive of costs; and cited the rule
made in the case of Course v. Stead's Executors,
ante, vol. 1. p. 17.
But MARSHALL, Ch.J. said, that that rule applied only to. cases where the property itself (and
not damages) was the matter in dispute--such as
actions of detinue, &c.
If the judgment below be for the plaintiff, that
judgment ascertains the value of the matter in dispute; but where the judgment below is rendered
for the defendant, this court has not, by any rule of.
practice, fixed the mode of ascertaining that value.
The poit
ntarising upon the bill of exceptions was
submitted without argument-,
MARSHALL, 'Ch.J. after stating the case as it appeared in the bill of exceptions, observed.

That the court had-iome difficulty upon the point.
The-general rule of evidence is,that the. best evidence must be produced which the nature of the
case admits, and which is in the power of the party.
In consequence of-that rule, the testimony of the
subscribing witness must be had if possible. But
if it appear that the testimony of the subscribing
witness cannot be had, the next best evidence is
proof of'his hand-writing. In the present case it
does not appear to the court that the tesimhony of
the subscribing witness could not have been'obtained
if proper diligence had been used foi that purpose.
It does not appear that tbe witness had ever left
Norfolk. It is not stated that any inquiry concerning him had been made there. If such inquiry had
been made, and he could not be found, evidence of
hi hand-writing might have been permitted. But
