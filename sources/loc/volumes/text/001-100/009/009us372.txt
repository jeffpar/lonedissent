SUPREME COURT.

S.

In all cases too where additional duties have leen
imposed, the construction of the treasury has awayc
been, that the additional dutieo are to be paid if the'

vessel arrived at.theport after the day fixed by law,"
although she arrived withiu the districtbefore that
day.
-March 15.
MARSH, L, Ch. J. delivered the opinion of the
court to the following effect:

The distinction taken by the counsel for the defendants in error, between a- distict and a port of
entry, is correct. The duties did not accrue in the
fiscal sense-of the term, uritil the vessel arrived at
the port of entry. If the question had been doubt"ful, the court would have respected the uniform con.
struction which it is understood has been given by
the treasury department of the United States upon
similar questions. It is understood that in case of
an increase of duty, the United States have always
demanded and received 'the additional duty if. the
goods have not arrived at the port of.entry before
the tim-e fixed for the commencement of such additional duty, although the vessel may have arrived
within the collection' district before that time, The
same rule of construction is to be' observed when
there is a diminution of duty.
Judgment affirmed.

C. Lee, contraj contended, that there was a repugnapiee between the act of 1789a, and that of 1803, the
latter declaring that appeals in such cases should be
directly to the supreme court.
But the Court was of opinion that this not being
