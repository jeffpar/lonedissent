rally; leaving Auld to his -remedy upon the warranty
of the complainants 'for any defect of title which
might appear. Auld, perhaps, thought it would be
a good speculation, and had stipulated for a general
warranty.
He acquiesced, however, in dismissing the bill,
because he considered the judgment in the.action
at law brought byAuld against the complainants,
as equivalent to a decree for a specific execution
of the agreement, inasmuch as it prevents him from
obtaining satisfaction in any other way for the sum
awarded.
MARSHALL, Ch. J. declared the opinion of the
court, in the action at law, to be, that the tender of
the assignment of Graham's contract, and the power
of attorney, was good as pleaded, and that Auld
ought to have accepted it.

Judgment reversed.
