SUPREME COURT U. S.

YATOX
The following sentence was then pronounced by
V.
M., . s, the court:
Thii cause came onto be heard on the transcript
of the record, and was argued by coun sel; on consideration whereof' the court is of opinion, that an
appeal from the sentence of a court of admiralty
brings the whole case before the appellate court unaffected by the sentence of condemnation from
which the appeal is made, and that a sentence
of condemnation cannot be pronounced on account
of a forfeiture which accrued under a law not in
force at the' time of pronouncing such sentence, unless, by some statutory provision, the right to enforce such forfeiture be preserved.
The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the sen.tence pronounced in this cause by the circuit court of
the district of Maryland, affirming the sentence of the
judge of the district court in this cause, be reversed.
and annulled; and the court, proceeding to pronounce the proper sentence, doth direct that th
libel be dismissed, and the property libelled be restored to the- claimants, they paying the duties
thereon if the same have not been already paid.
And, on the motion of the attorney-general, it is
ordered to be certified that in the opinion of this
court, there was probable cause of seizure.

Th following facts were admitted, viz. that the
defendants imported a .certain quantity of round
copper plates, under the denomin~tioh "fat bottoms ;" round copper plates turned up at the edges,
under the denomination of "raised bottoms;" and
square and oblong copper plates, under the denomination of" sheets." That the round copper plates, and
the round copper plates turned up at the edge, are
never used, nor imported for use in the form in which
they are imported, although they are capable of being
used, but not with convenience or advantage, in that
form; but are worked up by the manufacturers in this
country into vessels of use after importation.' That
the round copper plates, as well as the square copper
plates, are cut from large sheets which are made by
'pressure under a roller, but are ever imported in
the size or .shape in which they come' from tfie
roller. That it is a great convenience and saving to
the manufacturer here that the sheets of copper
should come in a round rather than in a square
shape, avoiding great waste by clipping and repeat&dheats. That all the said articles are sold and
bought by weight, and the same price paid for the
round plates, and the -round plates turned up at the
edges, as for the square or oblong plates. That
the round copper plates turned up at the edge
are raised at the edge from four to five inches. That
copper plates of this description are sold for elghteenpence sterling per pound, and that copper
wrought up into vessels or implements of any kind,
are sold at two shillings and fourpence to two shillings and sixpence per pound. That there is no
copper imported into this country, under the denomination of plates; but that the square and oblong
plates, 'vhich are commonly called copper plates,
and are admitted to be free of duty, are imported
under the denomination of sheets.

,It appears to'have - een the policy of the United
