to refer.

"This act, or any of its allegations, has no'.influence on my opifiion.. Let this opinion. be erroneous or correct, a proceeding, in some of its parts,
indecorous, and, in others, unjustifiable, can have
no. operation in rectifying supposed errors, or convincing my judgment. But from prudential, more
.than'other motives,. I deemed it best to avoid embroiling the government of the United States and
that of Penns) Ivania (if the latter government sho'uld
ehoose so to do) on a question which has resie.d on
my single opinion, so far as it is touched by my decree:, and, under .the influence of this sentinent, I
have withheld thv process required. If this be not
considered a legal cause, it must be deemed a candid acknowledgment that I do not invariably obey
a x:ignrous dictate of duty, or follow an inflexibly
strict construction of law.
"9I entertained a hope that,,a legislature succeeding that by which the act before mentioned was
passed, would, under a more temperate view of the
subject, have repealed it; and enabledrand directed
the executive of the state, or some other authority, to
put this case in a legal train of investigation: So that
the final judgment and decree of the superior tribunal
bf the United States might have been, in a proper
course, obtained , and thereby any erroneous opinion,
or decree, given or ma'de by me, might have been
rectified (if. any o4inion-or decree should have been
*found illegal or erroneous) in' a manner more becoming the real dignity of a state, more suitable to
the. situation of those who execute the duties of a
branch of the governme'nt of the United States, and
more consistent with the good order and peace of
the community. This hope was cherished by- the
proceedings of the legislature of Pennsvlvania, in
'other cases wherein the state claimed ,interests.
This expectation has been disa "ointed. There be"Ingno other legal mode of obtainiig the decision of

TUE U. S. the superior tribunal of the United States, (the only.

jurisdiction by which the judgments of inferior

under all circumstances, fully justifiable, to obtain
that decision, by placing. the case under the cognisance of your honoiurable court, in its present form.
" On the merits and justice of the claim of the
libellants, I have no doubt; but remain of the
same opinion I have mentioned in my decree.
" As to the juiisdiction; I have never conceived
that the allegations on. this point, contained in the
act of ass.embly last mentioned, had legal 'foundation. It is well known to your honourable court,
that third persons claiming interes ts in pais, cannot,
by such claims, constitute themselves, or be judidially considered, parties in suits pending in ihe

legal mode of interpleading, or compelling states to

But if, on the

sloop to New-York, then in ppssession of the Bitish, with- a cargo of supplies for "the fleets and armiesif Great Britain. During which voyage, about
the- 6th of September, .1778, they rose upon the
master and'crew of the sloop, confined them to tile
cabin, took the command'of-the vessel' and steered'
for Egg .Harbour, in the state of New-Jersey. On
the. 8th of September, when in' sight of'that harbour they were'pursued, and forcibly taken possession of by Captain Thdmas, Houston, commander
'of the armed brig Convention,.belon'gihgto the state
of Pennsylvania, and, on the 15th 'of Septe iber,
brought into the port cf Philadelphia-; -when Houston libelled the ve'ssel as prize to the Convention. A

The finding of the jury, alluded to in the above
order, was in these words:

".Ip the cause wherein Thomas Houston is libellant, and Olmstead and others first claimants, and
James Josiah second claimant, we find as follows:
1-4th of the net proceeds of the sloop Active and

3-4ths or tne net proceeds of said sloop and her
cargo to the libellant and to th6 second claimants,
as per agreement between them.

,issued to the marshal to make sale of the *vessel
and cargo, in pursuance of the above order, and
which was accordingly issued on the 28h of December, 1778, afterreciting the proceedings in this

On which day at 8 olcloc/.A. M. the court of appials

of nine on that morning for the marshal to pay into

Active .and cargo; which suggestion was supported by the oath of the registrar of the admiralty;
whereupon it was prayed that an injunction might

keep the, moaey in his banhr, until the further orde"

The certificates were afterwards funded in the
name of David Ritienhouse, and among his papers
was found a list of the old loan-office certificates,
and, of the new funded stock, at the foot of which
was written, in the hand writing of Mr. Rittenhouse
thetiollowving memorandum:
"Note. The above certfi cates will be the property of 'the stats of PenIIs- Ivania, when the state
releases me from the bond I gave in 1778, to indemnify George Ross, Esq. judge of the admiralty,

treasury as the stae's share of the "prize."
In the year 1801, the legislature of Pennsylvania
passed an act requiring the treasulier to call upon the
executrixes of Mr. Rittenhouse for the certificates bf
stock, and to give them a bond of indemnity, but they
refused to deliver. thtm up, being atdvised that they
would not be safe in so doing.

judge of the state court of admiralty, the sums mentioned in the libel, which were invested in the certificates of stock as stated therein. Mr. Rittenhouse,
on ieceiving these certificates, whichi were proceeds
of the sales of the said sloop and cargo, gave'a bond
of indemnity to' Mr. Ross, which is now offered,
livhenpavment of these proceeds is made, to be. delivered- up. The suit- is instituted for the purpose.
of carrying.int 6 effect a decree of the court of appeals established under the old. cbnfederation, a copy
whereof appears among the exhibits. In the answer it is alleged that the moneys wire received for
the state of Pennsylvania. In the rtplication this is
in'a memorandum made by Mr. Rittendenied.
house, at the foot of the abcbount exhibited, it appears
that he intended to 'pay over these proceeds to the
state, when indemnified. .No such payment ever has

been made, and the certificates and moneys are yet
in the hands of the respondents."It appears to me that Mr. Ritten'house cbnsidered
himself,' as I conceive he was, a stakeholder, liable
to' pay over -the deposit to those la*fully entitled
thereto. His executors conceibe 'themselves in the
same predicament, and have declined paying over
the certificates and interest. No counsel'have ap.peared, and requested to, be heard on the part.6f
the respondents,- -and 'I am left to judge fron the

certificates and interest being now in the hands of
the respondents is granted by them in their answer.
It has been determined by the supreme court of the
United States that this court has power to effectuate
the decrees of the late court of appreals in prize
causes, and this court has, on several occasions,
practised agreeably to that decision. There i. no
doubt in my mind (the authorities in the books being
clear on this'point) that the process and jurisdictioiq
of this court.wiIl reach and extend over the proceeds
of all ships, goods and articles" taken as lawful prize,
found within the district, and legally proceeded
against therein. These proceeds are under the
same legal disposition, and subject.to the same responsibility, under whatever shape they may appear,
as the original thing from which they were produced.
It is conceded -that the certificates and moneys in
question are proceeds of the sloop and cargo in the
libel mentioned." These werb decreed to the libellants by thee judgment of the late court of appeals.
I am, therefore, of opinion, and accordingly decree,
and' finally adjudge and determine, that the certificates be transferred and delivered, -and the interest
moneys paid over by the respondents to the libellants, in execution of the- judgment and decree of
the court of appeals, as stated in the proceedings in
this cause, with costs. tmake it, however, a condition that the bond of indemnity be cancelled or delivered to the re'pondents, on their compliance with
this decree.

In the early part of the war between the United

others, citizens of Connecticut, who- say. they had
been carried to Jamaica as prisoners, were employed as part of the crew of the stoop Active, bound
from Jamaica to New-York, and laden with a cargo
for the use of the British army in that place. Oh
the voyage they seized the vessel, confined the captain, and sailed for Egg Harbour. In sight of that
place, the Active was captured by the Convention,
an armed ship belonging to the state of Pennsylvania, 'brought into port, libelled and condemned as
'prize to the captors. From this sentence Gideon
Olmstead and others, who claimed the vessel and
cargo, appealed to 'the court of appeals established
by congress, by which .tribunal the senten'ce of condemnation was reversed, the Active and her cargo
condemned as prize to the claimants, and process
was directed to issue out of the court of. admiralty,
.commanding the marshal of that court to sell the
said vessel and cargo, and to pay 'the net proceeds
to the claimants.
The mandate.of the appellate court was produced
in the inferior court, the judge of which admitted
the general jurisdiction of the couit established b'y
congress, ab an appellate cotirt, but denied its power
to control the*verdict of a jury whicfi 'had been rendered in favour et the captors, the officers and crew
of the Convention; and therefore refused obedieie
to the mandate: 'but directed the marshal to make
the sale, and, after deducting charges, to bring the
residue'of the money into court, subject to its future
order.
The, claimants then alplied to the judges- of aipeals, for an injunction to prohibit the marshal froni,
payiing the money, arising from 'the sales,'intto the
court of admiralty; which was awarded, and s rved
upon him: in contempt of which, on 'the 4th of
January, 1778, he paid the money to th judge, who
acknowledged the receipt thereof at the foot of the
marshal's return.

~ Pennsylvania, the sum of 11,4961. 9s. 9d. in loahoffice' certificates; 'which was the proportion of the
prize money to..which that state would have been entitled, had the sentence of the courwf admiralty rdmained in force. On the same day, David. Wgittenhoude executed a bond of indemnity to George Ross,
in which, after reciting that the money -was paid to
him for the use of the state of Pennsylvania, he
binds himself to repay the same, should the said
George' Ross be thereafter comfelled, by due
course of law, to pay that sum according to the decree of the court of appeals.

These loan-office certificates were in the name ot
Matthew Clarkson, who was marshal of the court
of admiralty, and were dated the 6th of INovember,
1778; *Indents were issued on them' to David
Rittenhouse, and the whole principal and interest
were afterwards funded by him, in his own name,
under the act of congress making provision for the
debt of the United States.
Among the papers of David Rittenhouse was a
memorandum, made by himself at the foot of a list
of the certificates mentioned above, in these words :
" Note. The .bove certificates will be the property
of the state of Pennsylvania, when the state releases
me from the bond I gave in 1778, to indemnify
George 'Ross, Esq. judge of the admiralty, -for paying the 50 original certificates into the. treasury, as
thd'state's share of the prize."

The state did not release David Rittenhouse fro i
the lVond mentioned in. this memorandum. These certificates remained in (he'private possession of David
lRitteihouse, who drcw the interest on them during
his life-, and after his 'death they remained in possession of his representatives; against whom the libel
in this case was filed, for the purpose of carrying
into execution the decree of the court of appeals.

-While this suit was depending, the state of Penn- TiE U. S..
sylvania forbore to assert its title, and, in January, pv-.
1803, the court decreed in favour of the libellants;

soon itfter which, the legislature passed the act which
has'been stated.
It is contended that the federal courts were deprived of jurisdiction, in this cause, by that amendment of the constitution which exempts states from
being sued in those courts by individuals. This
amendment ddclares, "that .the judicial power of
the United States shall not be construed to extend
to any suit, in law or equity,' commenced or pt'osecuted against one of thv United States by citizens
f another state, or by citizens or subjects of any
foreign state."
The right of a state to assert, as plaintiffs any interest it may have in a subject, which forms the
matter of controversy, between individuals, in one
of the courts of the United States, is not affected by
this amendment; 'nor*-can it be so construed as ..to
oust the court of its jurisdiction, should such claim
be suggested. ' The amendment- simply provides,
that no suit shall be commenced or prosecuted
against a state. The state cannot be made a defendant to a suit brought by' an ihdividual; but it remains the duty of the courts of the Unite4 States
to decide all cases brought before them by citizens of
one state against citizens of a different state, where
a state. is not necessarily a defenaant, In this case,
the suit *as not instituted against the state or its
treasurer, but against the executrixes of David Rittenhouse, for the proceeds of a-vessel condemned 'ifx
the court of adtniralty, which were admitted to be'
-in their possession. .If these proceeds had been the
actual 1r6perty of Pennsylvania, however wrongfully acquired, the disclosure of that fact would have
presented a ease on which it was' unnecessary to
give an opinion; but it certainly can never be alleged, that a mere suggestion of title in a state to
property, in possession of an individual, must arrest
the proceedings of the court, and' prevent their.

lidity of the title.
If the suggestion in this case be examined, it is
-deemed perfectly clear that no title whatever-to
the certifcates in.-question was vested in the state of
Pennsylvani
By the highest judicial-authority of the nation it
has been long since decided, that'the court of ap-peals erected by,congress had full authbrity ta revise and correct the sentences of the courts of admiralty of the several states,.in prize catises. That
question, therefore, is at rest. Consequently, the
decision of -the court of appeals in this case annulled the sentence of the courtof admiralty~atid extin-.
guished the interest of the state of Pennsylvania in
the Active and her.cargo, which was acquired by that'
sentence. The full right to that property was immediately vested in the claimants, who might rightfully pursue it, into whosesoever hands it might come.
These certificates,' in the hadds. first, of Matthew
"Clarkson, the marshal, and afterwards of. George
Ross, the judge, of the court of admiralty, were the
al golute property'of the claimants. Nor did they
change their chuxacter on coming into the possession
of David Rittenhouse.
-Althoughi Mr. Rittenhouse was treasurer of the
state of Pennsylvania, and the bond of indemnity
which he executed states the money to have b.den
paid to him for the use. of-the state of Pennsylvainia, it is apparent that he hld them in his own
right, until he shbuld be-completely indemnified by
the state. 'The evidence to this point is conclusive.
'I he original certificates do not appear to'have been
deposited in the state treasury, to have been designated in any manner as the -property of the state,
or to have been delivered over to the successor of
David Rittenhouse, They remained in his possession. The indents, issued upon them for interest,

part of the debt of the United States, they were TuE 'U. 8.
funded by David Rittenhouse, and the interest was

drawn by him. The 'note made'by himself at the
foot of the list, jvhich he preserved, as explanatory
of the whole transaction, demonstrates that he held
the certificixtes'as security against the bond he had.
executed to George Ross; 'and that bond was obligatory, not on 'the state of Pennsylvania, but on
David Rittenhouse, in his private capacity.
These circumstances demonstrate, beyond the
possibility of doubt, that the property, which represented the Active'and her cargo, was.-.( possession,
noi of the state of Pennsylvania, but of David Rit* tenhouse as an individual; after whose-death it passed, like other property, to his representatives.
Since, then, the state of Pennsylvania had neither
possession of, nor right to,'the property on which
the sentence of the district court was pronounced,
and since.the suit was neither commenced nor prosecuted against that state, there remains no pretext
fpr the allegatiofi that the-case is within that amendment of the constitution which has been cited; and,
consequently, the state of Pennsylvania can possess
no constitutional right -to resist the legal process
which may be;directed in this cause.
It-will be readily conceived that the order which
this court is -enjoined to make by the high obligations of duty and of law, is not made without extreme regret at the necessity which has induced the
application. But it is a olenin duty, and therefore
must be performed. A peremptory mandamus muwt
be awardrd.
