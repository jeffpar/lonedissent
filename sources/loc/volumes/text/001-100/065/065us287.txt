DECEM1BER TERM, 1860.

Bisse etal. v.CiCy of J'eronviZle.

We do not doubt that the act applies to this suit. The bill
prays that the equity of redemption be foreclosed, or that the
undivided interest, to the extent of twenty acres in the quarter
section alleged to be covered bythe mortgage, be sold, and the
proceed appropriated towards paying the debts secured. As
neither of these modes of relief are cognizable at law, and the
only remedy is in equity, it is manifestly barred by the terms
of the act.
By .a previous provision of the act of 1839, (section 37,)
where there are concurrent remedies at law and in equity, the
remedy in equity is barred in the same time that the remedy
at law is barred; and what we mean to say is, that the remedies demanded to -be enforcedby the bill have no corresponding remedy at law, and therefore fall-within the 40th section
of the act.
As respects the other' defendants to the bill, no relief can
be had against them. By his purchase of the bankrupt's title,
Rogers took the equity of redemption, and cut off all claims to
the land the defendants had, assuming the statements in the
bill to be true.
We forbear to express any opinion on the defence relied on
by Rogers in his answer, namely, that he had purchased and
had deeds for the said quarter section from several tax collectors, which.he alleges are valid: and if not valid, that they are
confirmed by adverse possession and the operation-of the three
years' act of limitations.
It is ordered that the decree of the Circuit Court dismissing
the bill be affirmed.

GEORGE B. BISSELL, DAVID T. ROBINSON, AND CALVIN DAY,
PLAINTIFFS IN ERROR, V. THE CITY OF JEFFERSONVILLE.
The common council of tie city of Jeffersonville, in Indiana, had authority t6
subscribe for stock in a railroad company, and to issue bonds-for such sub.
scription, upon the petition of three-fourths of the legal voterg of the city.
The statutes of the State examined by which such authority was conferred.
Under one of these acts, the common council determined that three-fourths had

so petitioned; and under a subsequent act, authorizing them to revise the
subject, they again came to the same conclusion, and issued the bonds.
Jurisdiction of the subject-matter on the part of the common council was made
to depend upon the fact whether thq petitioners whose names'were app6nded
constituted three-fourths of the legal voters of the city, and the common council
were made by the laws the tribunal to decide that question.
When sued upon the bonds by innocent holders for value, it was too late to
introduce parol testimony to show that the petitioners did not constitute -threefourths of the legal voters of the city.

It was an action of assumpsit, and was instituted by the present plaintiffs against the corpnra'tion defendants, to recover
two instalments of interest which had accrued upon certain
bonds, purporting to have been duly issued in the name of
the defendants, for stock subscribed in their behalf by the
common council of the city to the Fort Wayne and Southern
Railhoad Company. Assuming to act in behalf of the city,
the common council subscribed two hundred thousand dollars

to the stock of the railroad company, and on the twenty-fourth
day of April, 1855, issued two hundred bonds, of one thousand dollars each, in the name of the city, and subsequently
delivered the same to the railroad company, in payment for
the stock previously subscribed. Interest on the whole amount
of the loan was to be paid semi-annually ii the city of New
York, at the rate of six per cent., and coupons or warrants for
the same, payable to bearer, were annexed to each separate
bond. Plaintiffs became the holders, for value, and in the
usual course of their business, of thirty-seven of these bonds;
and the suit in this case was founded on thirty-seven of the
coupons for the first instalment of interest, and thirty-six
coupons for the second instalment. As amended, the declaration contained'a count for money had and received, and a
special count upon each of the seventy-three coupons. De-'
fendants pleaded the general issue, and also filed -a special
plea, in bar of the cause of action set forth in the several
special counts. More particular reference to the special- plea
is unnecessary, as it was subsequently held bad on general
demurrer, and at the same time the parties went to trial on
the general issue.
To maintain the issue, on their part, the plaintiffs, in the
first place, introduced one of the original bonds, which is set
forth at large in the record. Among other things, it recites,
in effect, that it was issued by authority of the common council of the city, and that three-fourths of the legal voters thereof "petitioned for the same, as required by the charter." They
also gave in evidence, without objection, the several coupons
described in the declaration. All of the coupons, as well as
the bonds given in evidence, were signedby the mayor of the
eity,, and were countersigned by the city clerk, and the defendants admitted their execution.
Presentment and protest of the coupons for non-payment
were also duly proved by the plaintiffs; dnd to show that the
bonds were duly and legally issued, they introduced the
records of the common coumil of the city, and the minutes
of their, proceedings upon that subject. From that record it
appeared that on the twenty-third day of August, 1853, a

petition of certain legal voters of the city was presented to
the common council, representing that the construction of the
beforc-mentioned railroad would be of great benefit to the
public generally, and especially to the commercial interests of
the city, and praying that the board to which it was addressed
would subscribe stock in the railroad to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, and contract a loan for an equal amount,
through the issue of city bonds, for the payment of the subscription. That petition purports on its face to have been
signed by four hundred and sixty-seven persons, and it recites
that they constituted at that time three-fourths of the legal
voters of the city. On the day of its presentation it was referred by vote of the common council to three members of the
board, who reported in effect that they found, upon examination of the petition, and of the poll-book of the last charter
election, that the names of more than three-fourths of the
legal voters of the city were appended to the petition, and
they also reported a preamble and resolution to carry into
effect the prayer of the petitioners. Evidently the report of
the commitlee was entirely satisfactory, as the record shows
that the resolution was immediately adopted, without alteration or amendment, by the unanimous vote of the board.
Without reproducing the document, it will be sufficient to
say, that the common council thereby resolved, in case the
road came into the city, to subscribe two hundred thousand
dollars to the stock of the railroad company, and the prQamble,
which was adopted as a part of the resolution, expressly
affirmed the fact reported by the committee, that more than
three-fourths of the legal voters of t6e city had petitioned for
that object. Pursuant to that determination, the parties having met, and arranged the terms and conditions of the proposed agreement, a contract was made with the railroad company, that the common council should make the subscription
thus authorized, and execute and deliver the bonds of the city
to the company for an equal amount in payment for the stock.
Throughout the period when these proceedings took place, the
parties to them, it seems, had acted upon the supposition that
the fifty .sixth section of the general law of the State for the

DECEMBER TEIRM,. 1860.
Bisell etal. v. City of Jffersonville.

incorporation of cities fully authorized the defendants, through
their common council, to make the subscription and issue the
bonds. Before the bonds were issued, however, the Supreme
Court of the State decided, in an analogous case, that no suich
authority was conferred upon cities by that section. 1 Rev.
Stat., 215; the City of Lafayette v. Cox, 5 Ind. R., 88.
Some delay ensued in issuing the bonds, apparently in consequence of that decision; but on the twenty-first day of February, 1855, the Legislature of the State passed an additional
act to enable cities which had subscribed for stock in companies incorporated to construct works of public utility to ratify
such subscriptions. By the first section of that act, the common council of any city which had contracted such obligations
or liabilities upou the supposition that they were authorized so
to do under the provisions of the former act might, "at any'
time after the passage of this act, ratify and affirm such subscription;" and upon such ratification it was expressly enacted,
that "such subscription, and the obligation and liabilities;and
the corporate bonds or obligations issued or to be issued therefor by such city, shall be valid." Sess. Acts 1855, p. 132.
To prove such ratification, the plaintiffs introduced the record
of the subsequent proceedings of the common council of the
city, showing that at their meeting held on the ixth day of
April, 1855, it was resolved by the board, then in session, that
the former contract between the city and the before-mentioned
railroad company, "for two hundred thousand dollars; be and
the same is hereby confirmed and ratified."
In this connection, the plaintiffs also proved by the same
record, that the common council, on the thirteenth day of
April of the same year, authorized and directed the mayor of
the city and the city clerk to procure and sign two hundred
bonds, of a thousand dollars each, in the name of the city, and
deliver the same to the railroad company, reciting in the resolution upon the subject that the proceeding was in accofdance
with the statute of the State, and the contract and arrangement previously made with the railroad company.. Prior to
the trial, the court, by the consent of parties, appointed a commissioner to take such evidence as either party might direci

to have taken, and to report both the evidence and his finding
of the facts proved' by it, subject to all exception as to the
competency of the testimony, and the correctness of his finding. He reported that three-fourths of the legal voters of the
city had not signed the petition to the common council, which
constituted the foundation of their action in making the subscription to the stock and issuing the bonds. This'report was
accompanied by the several depositions on which it was founded, and'the transcript shows that certain portions of the testimona of the deponents tended to prove the fact reported by
the commissioner. Defendants offered the report, with the
several depositions, in evidence, to prove, among other things,
that the petition in question was not signed by three-fourths
of the legal voters of the city. They aTso offered oral evidence
to prove the same fact. To all such testimony the plaintiffs
objected, and also moved the court to suppress all such portions of the depositions taken by the commissioner as tended
to prove that a less number than three-fourths of the legal
voters had petitioned for the subscription to the stock and for
the issuing of the bonds. But all of these objections of the
plaintiffs were overruled by the court, and the report of the
commissioner, with the depositions as taken by him, and the
parol testimony, were admitted to the jury, and the plaintiffs
excepted to the several rulings in that behalf. Further testimony was then given by the plaintiffs, showing that the bonds
in question were negotiated to *themfor value by the agent of
the railroad company; and that the agent, at the time they
were received, exhibited to them the certificate of the city
clerk, under the seal of the city, giving a condensed statement
of the proceedings of the common council from the presentation of the petition to the delivery of the bonds, and affirming,
in effect, that all those proceedings appeared of record in the
o)ffice of the city clerk; and they further proved, that he also
exhibited to them at the same time another certificate, signed
by the mayor of the city and city clerk, showing that the bonds
had been exchanged with the railroad company for an equal
amount of their capital stock, and affirming that tne exchange
ws authorized by the contract between the parties and the

resolutions of the common" council of the city.

After the tes-

timony was closed, the court instructed the jury to the effect
that, .if they found from the evidence that three-fourths of the
legal voters of the city fiad petitioned for the subscription to
the stock, and for the issuing of the bonds, their verdict should
be for the plainttiff; but if they found that three-fourths o~f
the legal voters had not so petitioned, then their verdict should
be for the defendants. Under the rulings and instructions: ofthe court, the jury returded their verdict In favor of the defendants, and the plaintiffs excepted to the instructions.

voters of the city did not petitibn for the subscription to the
stockand the issuing. of the bonds. That question is raised,as well by the exceptions-to the rulings of the court in admitting such testimony as by those taken to the instructions given
to th6 jury.

Some further reference, however, to the law under which
the'common council acted, in making'the subscription and in
issuing the bonds, becomes necessary before we proceed to the
examination of that question.. It is conceded on both sides
that the defendants had adopted the general law of the State,.
entitled an act for the incorporation of cities, before any of
these proceedings were commenced. Prior to the adoption
of that law by the corporation, the charter of the city authorized the common council to subscribe, in the name of the city,
for any amount of stock in railroad or turnpike companies
formed, or to be formed, for the purpose of constructing any
railroad or turnpike from the city to any other point, provided
the stock so held by the city did not, at any time, exceed one
hundred thousand doltars; and with that view, they were
authorized to borrow money or issue bonds to pay for such
stock. But it is admitted by the plaintiffs that the corporation, at the date of the proceedings in question, was duly

organized under the subsequent general law for the incorporation of cities, which provides, ineffect,-that the acceptance
of that act by any incorporated city shall be deemed a surren-

SUPREME COURT.

der by such city of its prior charter. By the fifty-.sixth section
of the last-named act it is also provided, that no incorporated
city, under this act, shall have power to borrow money, or
incur any dpht or liability, unless three-fourths of the legal
voters shall petition the common council to contract such debt
or loan. All of the proceedings in question which led to the
contract for the subscription to the stock tobk place under
that provision of the charter; and we have already adverted
to the fact that the Supreme Court of the State decided, before the bonds were issued, that, by its true construction,. it
did, not authorize a subscription to the stock'of a railroad
company. At the argument, the construction adopted by the
State court was controverted by the counsel of the plaintiffs.
But suppose it to be correct; still the limitation. or restriction
was one created by the Legislature which granted the charter,
and certainly it was competent for the same authority to repeal
it altogether, or to substitute some other in its place.
Municipal corporations are created by the authority of the
Legislature, and Chancellor Kent says they are invested with
subordinate legislative powers, to be exercised for local purposes connected with the public good, and such powers are
spbject to the control of the Legislature of the State. 2 Kent's
Com., p. 275.
Whatever may be the true construction of that section of
the charter, it is nevertheless certain that it was under that
provision that the.petition for the sukscription was presented
to the common council, and it is equally certain that it was
under the same provision that they heard and determined the
question whether the petition actually contained the signatures
of three-fourths of the legal voters of the city. Bad faith is
not imputed to the board, nor is it denied that they acted
"upon the supposition" that they were authorized by that
provision, on "the written petition of three-fourths of the legal
voters of the city," to subscribe for the stock and contract to
issue the bonds. Having ascertained and determined that
three-fourths of the legal voters had petitioned, they adopted
the resolution reported by the committee, and entered into the
contract with the railroad company. Clearly, therefore, the

Bissell et al. v. City ofTeffersonville.

common council had contracted the obligation to take the
stock; and in case of refusal,. would have been liable in damages for a breach of the contract. Other cities in the State
had contracted like obligations under similar circumstances;
and to remedy the anticipated difficulty, and to remove the
doubt first suggested by the decision of the Supreme Court of
the State, the Legislature passed the explanatory act of the
twenty-first of February, 1855, to which reference has been
made.
Sufficient has already been remarked to show that the circufistances of the case exhibited in the record bring it within
the very terms of the act; and if so, then the common council
might lawfully ratify and affirm the subscription; and upon
such ratification it is expressly declared that the bonds issued
or to be issued shall be valid.
Mistakes and irregularities in the proceedings of municipal
corporations are of frequent occurrence, and the State Legislatures have often had occasion to pass laws to'obviate such
difficulties. Such laws, when they do not impair any contract, or injuriously affect the rights of third persons, are gen'erally regarded as inobjectionable, and certainly are within
the conpetency of the legislative authority. 'Unlike what is
sometimes exhibited in laws of this description, the Legislature did not attempt to ratify the subscription, but left the
matter entirely optional with the common council, as the representatives of the city, to accept or reject the proffered remedy. They elected to ratify and affirm the subscription; and
by so doing, gave the same effect to the contract to subscribe
for the stock, and to all the prbceedings that led to-it, as if
the authority to make it had been coeval with the presentation
of the petition on which those proceedings were founded. No
injustice will result from this conclusion, as it is obvious that
the contract had been made in good faith, under the full be.
lief that they were duly authorized to subscribe" for the stock,
and issue the bonds in the name of the city, so that the only
operation of the confirmatory resolutiOn was to give the very
effect to the proceedings which they had intended, but which,
troni the defect in their authority, had not been accomplished.

Watson v. Mercer, 8 Pet., p. 111; Wilkinson v. Leland et al.,
2 Pet., p. 661.
Authority on the part of the common council- to subscribe
for the stock, and to issue the bonds on the petition-of threefourths of the legal voters of the city, is therefore shown to
have existed, and must be assumed in the further consideration
of the case. With this explanation as to the authority.of the
common. council, we will proceed to the examination of the
main question discussed at th bar.
2. It is insisted by the plaintiffs that the defendants had nc
right to disprove the verity of their own records, certificates,
and representations, concerning the facts necessary to give validity to the bonds. On the other hand, the defendants controvert that proposition, and insist that it was competent for
them under the circumstances to prove, by parol testimony,
that the records given in evidence did not speak the truth, and
that, in point of fact, three-fourths of the legal voters had not
petitioned, as required by the charter. Unless three-fourths
of the legal voters bad petitioned, it is clear that the bonds
were issued without authority, as by the terms of the explanatory act it could only apply to a case where the common
council of a city had contracted the obligation or liabilities
therein specified upon the petition of three-fourths of the legal
voters of such city; and if no such petition had been presented,
or if it was not signed by the requisite number of the legal
voters, the law did not authorize the common council to ratify
and affirm the subscription. That fact, however, had been
previously ascertained and determined by the board to which
the petition was originally addressed.
After the explanatory act was passed, the common council
were fully authorized to revise the finding of the former board;
and if it did not appear, upon inquiry and proper investigation,
that it was correct, it was their duty, as the representatives of
the city, to have refused to ratify and, affirm the contract fo!
the subscription. Such an inqu*iry might have been made
through the medium of a cornyiittee, as it had been when the
petition was presented, or in -any other mode, satisfactory to
the board, which would enable them to ascertain the true state

DECEMBER TERM, 1860.

297

Bissell et al. v. Citj qfJefersonvule.

of the case. By the terms of the explanatory act they were
authorized to ratify and affirm the subscription, if the obligation or liability incurred had been contracted on the petition
of three-fourths of the legal voters of the city; and, of course,
the necessary implication is, that they must be satisfied that
the requisite number bad petitioned. In making that investigation, however, it was not required that there should be.a
new petition, and the law is eutirely silent as to the manner
in which it was to be conducted. If the common council was
composed of the same persons who had. already passed upon
the question, further investigation was unnecessary, provided
they were satisfied with their.former determination. Such of
the members as knew the record of the fact to be correct might
safely act upon their own' personal knowledge, without further
inquiry; and if there were any who had not been members of
the board when the prior determination was made, they might
ascertain the fact in any mode which was satisfactory to themselves and their associates. Nothing appears in the record to
show whether further information upon the subject was necessary or desirable, or, if so, what means were adopted to obtain it; but it does appear that the board unanimously resolved to 'ratify and confirm the contract with the railroad
company, and subsequently issued the bonds, reciting in each
that it was issued by authority of the common council of the
city, "three-fourths of the legal voters of the city having petitioned for the same as requited by the charter. ' Taken together, we think the -record of the resolution ratifying and
confirming the contract, and the recital.ih the bonds, furnish
conclusive evidence in this case that the common council did
readjudicate the question, whether the requisite, number of the
ldgal voters of the city had signed.the petition. Fraud is not
iimputed in this case, and it does not appear that it was even
suggested at the trial in the court below that the board neglected that duty at the time. the contract was confirmed; but
the defence was, that tle finding was erroneous, because the
petition, as matter of fact, did not contain tbree-fourths of the
legal voters of the city.
3. It only remains to consider the effect of that determiua

.SUPREME COURT.
.Bissellet al. v. aity of.Tffersonvill

tion as between the defendants and the holders for value of
the bonds, without notice of the supposed defect in the proceedings under which they were issued, and put into the market. Two hundred bonds, with twelve hundred interest warrants, or coupons, were issued in the name of the city, and the
coupons, as well as the bonds, were payable to bearer. Interest was payable semi-annually, but the redemption of the principal was postponed for a period exceeding twenty-five years.
Capita'ists could not be expected to accept such paper, and
advance money for it, unless the authority to issue it was put
beyond dispute. They certainly would not pay value for such
securities, with knowledge that the question under consideratiorn would be open to litigation whenever payment, either of
principal or interest, was demanded. Purchasers of such
paper look at the form of the paper, the law which authorized
it to be issued, and the recorded proceedings on which it is
based. When the law was passed authorizing the common
council to ratify and affirm the contract with the railroad company, it must have been understood by the Legislature that
the bonds were to be received by the company in payment for
the stock, and used as a means for borrowing money for the
construction of the road, and it could hardly have begn expected that the object could be accomplished, if, by the true
construction of the act, it contemplated that the*bonds should
be issued before it was conclusively determined that the requisite number of the legal voters of the city had petitioned the
common council But a much stronger reason why that construction cannot be adopted is, that it would involve an absurdity, as it would render the law altogether inoperative, or
else it would admit that the bonds might be issued without
authority.
Whether three-fourths of the legal voters had petitioned or
not, was a question'of fact; and if not ascertained and conclusively settle& before the bonds were is sued, it would remain
open to future inquiry, and might be determined in the negative; and clearly the coj?1fmon council could not lhwfully ratify
and affirm the subscription, unless that proportion of the legaO
voters had petitioned; and without such ratification, the bonds

would be invalid. Beyond question, therefore, that construetion must be rejected.
-Jurisdiction of the subject-matter on the part of the common
council was made to depend upon the petition, as described in
the explanatory act, and of necessity there must be some tribunal to determine whether the petitioners, whose names were
appended, constituted three-fourths of the legal voters of the
city, else the board could not act at all. None other than the
common council, to whom the petition was required to be addressed, is suggested, either in the charter or the explanatory
act, and it would be difficult to point out any other sustaining
a similar relation to the city so fit to be charged with the inquiry, or one so fully possessed of the necessary means of information to discharge the duty. Adopting the ladguage of
this court in the case of the Commissioners of Knox county v..
Aspinwall et al, 21 How., 544, we are of the opinion that
"this board was one, f'omn its organization and general duties,
fit and competent to be the depositary of the trust confided to
it." Perfect'acquiescence in the decision and action of the
board seems to have been manifested by the defendants until
the demand was made for the payinent of interest on the loain.
So far as appears, they never attempted to enjoin the proceedings, but suffered the authority to be executed, the bonds to
be issued, and to be delivered to the railroad company, witi,out interference or complaint.
'When the contract had been ratified -and affirmed, and the
bonds issued and delivered to the railroad company in exchange for the stock, it was then too late to call in question
the fact determined by the common council, and afortioriit is"
too late to raise that question in a case like the present, where
it is shown that the plaintiffs are innocent holders for value.
Duly certified copies of the record of the proceedings were
exhibited to the plaintiffs at the time they received the bonds,
showing to a demonstration that further examination upon tie
subject would have been. useless; for, whether we look to the
bonds or the recorded proceedings, there is nothing to indicate any irregularity, or even to create a suspicion that the
bonds had not been issued pursuant to a lawful authority; and

we hold that the company and their assigns, un'der the circumstances of this case, had a right to assume that they imported
verity.
Citation of authorities to this point is unnecessary, as the
whole subject has recently been examined by this court, and
the rule clearly laid down that a corporation, quite as much as
an individual, is held to a careful adherence to truth intheir
dealings with other parties, and cannot, by their representa'tions or silence, involve others in onerous engagements, and
then defeat the calculations and claims their own conduct has
superinduced. Zabriskie v. the Cleveland, &c,, Railroad Co.,

For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the parol testimony was improperly admitted, and that the instructions given
to the jury were erroneous. The judgment of the Circuit
Court is therefore reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded, with directions to issue a new venire.
