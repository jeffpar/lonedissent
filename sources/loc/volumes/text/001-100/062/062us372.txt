RUMBALL LIBELLANT.

In a collision between a sailing vessel and a steamer, which took place at sea,
near the shore of Long Island, where the course of the sailing vessel was converging to the track of the steamer, the sailing vessel being then close hauled
upon the wind, the evidence shows that the steamer was in fault.
The sailing vessel did not change her course, and her whole company, including
the master and mate, were on deck.
The rules of navigation are obligatory upon vessels approaching each other, from
the timethe necessity for precaution begins, and continue to be applicable as
the vessels advance, so long as the means and opportunity to avoid the danger
remain.
These rules require sailing vessels, when approaching a steamer, to keep theh
course; and steamers, under such circumstances, as a general rule, are required
to keep out of the way.
Under this rule, the steamer must of necessity determine for herself, and upon her
own responsibility, independently of the sailing vessel, whether it is safer to go
to the right or left, or to stop; and in order that she may not be deprived of
the means of determining the matter wisely, it is required that the sailing vessel shall keep her course, and allow the steamer to pass either on the right or
left, or to adopt such measures of precaution as she may deem best suited to
elnable her to perform her duty, and fulfil the requirement of the law to keep
out of the way.
Exceptional cases may be imagined; and where the rule could not be followed
without defeating the end for which it was established, or without producing
the mischief which it was'the design of the rule to avert, of course it would not
be applicable, and, in such a case, a departure from it wuid be both justifiable
and commendable.
But this not being such a case, the steamer must be responsible for the loss occasioned by the collision.
The cases decided by this court referred to.

THIS was an appeal from the Circuit Court of the United
States for the southern. district of New York, sitting in admiralty..
The case is fully stated in the opinion of the court.

It was argued by Mr. Potter for the appellants, and by Mr.
De Forest for the appellee. -

New York and Lireryoo U. S. Mail Stcamship Co. v. JRumball.

In cases of collision, it is difficult to make an abstract of the
arguments of counsel, because the whole evidence is before the
court, and resorted to by both sides in suppot of the positions
which they respectively take. The reporter can only state the
points which were made, without the arguments to sustain
Lhem.On the part of the appellants, it was contended:
1. The collision was caused by the brig. She changed her
30ourse, and ran into the steamer.
2. But if it be considered that the brig did not change her
course, still she ran into the steamer while endeavoring to get
out of her way, when she could easily hqve avoided it.
3. In any event, the steamer was not in fault, every effort
an her part being used to avoid the collision.
4. There are two points on which the proofs differ. 1. The
general course of the brig. 2. The time the brig showed a
light previous to the collision. Both these are assumed, by
the decree, to be as. claimed by the libellant, N ow it is, we
think, mathematically demonstrable that, if ihese matters are
as claimed, a collision could not have occurred.
5. The libellant has the burden of proof. To recover, he
must make it appear that the steamer was in fault, and not
leave the question of fault in doubt.
6. In any event, the damages were excessive. The libellant
was only entitled to the actual damage caused by the collision,
viz: the cost of bringing the brig into port and-refitting her.
The counsel for the appellee made the following points:
1. The steamer's course was east half south it the time the
brig's light was reported. The wind was free for the steamer;
all her sails and studding-sails were set; her speed was about
12J knots.
2. There is 'a slight disagreement among the witnesses as to
the direction of the wind, out the difference is not material.
3. The brig was sailing on the wind, northwest by west,
close hauled, on the larboard tack, her track converug toward
that of the steamer, and her speed about three to four knots

SUPREME COURT.
.New York and LiveTool U. S.Mail Steamship Co. v. RumbalZÂ°

4. The position of the brig, when her light was first discovered, was somewhat to the southward of the original track of
the steamer.
5. There is no substantial difference between the witnesses
as to the state of the atmosphere and weather, at the time of
the collision. The night was not unusually dark, and the atmosphere not thick.
6. It appears very clearly, from the testimony on both sides,
that the vessels were several miles apart when the light of the
brig was first displayed. -This is proved directly, and is to be
inferred from -various independent facts.
Mr. Justice CLIFFORD delivered the opinion of the court.
This is an appeal in admiralty, from a decree of the Circuit
Court of the United States for the southern district of New
York, in a cause of collision, civil and maritime. It was commenced in the District Court on the twenty-fourth day of September, 1851, by the appellee, in behalf of himself and the
other owners of the brig "Alfaretta." According to the case
made in the libel, the Alfaretta sailed from Millbridge, in the
State of Maine, on the tenth day of August, 1851, fully laden
with lumber on freight, and bound on a voyage to the port of
New York. She was-a tight, stanch, strong vessel of one hundred and sixty-three tons burden, and in every respect well
manned, tackled, apparelled, and appointed, with a competent
master, and sufficient crew; and was totally wrecked by the
collision which occurred on the sixteenth day of the same
month, without any fault of her officers or crew, and while she
was lawfully pursuing her voyage from the place of departure
to her place of destination. At the time of the disaster she
was fifteen or twenty miles off the southern shore of Long Island, sailing close hauled on the wind, with her larboard tacks
aboard, and all her sails set, and was heading about -northwest
by west. While sailing on that course, with a light wind from
southwest by west, her master and crew discerned a light bearing from them about west half south, which they judged to be
the light of a steamer; and the libellant, who was the master
of the Alfaretta, immediately caused a light to De hoisted in

the fore rigging of the brig. That vessel proved to be the
steamship Pacific, and it is alleged that she had such a large
number of lights that the libellant was not able to determine
what direction she was steering, and kept his vessel on her
course, without any deviation, until the collision took place.
It occurred between eight and ten o'clock in the evening, as
alleged in the libel, and about fifteen minutes after the light
was placed in the fore rigging of the brig, when the steamer,
with great force and violence, ran into and struck the brig on
her larboard bow, cutting her down to the water's edge, and
carrying away her foremast, so that she filled in a few minutn
and became a complete wreck.
On the fourteenth day of October following, the claimants of
the steamer filed their answer' to the allegations of the libel.
Among other things not necessary to be noticed, they deny
that the steamer had such a large number of lights at the time
referred to, that the libellant was not able to determine what
direction she was steering; and they also deny that the brig
kept her course, without any deviation, until the collision occurred; or that the steamer ran into and struck the brig in the
manner above stated. Their theory is, and they accordingly
allege that the steamer started from New York on the day of
the collision, on her intended voyage to Liverpool, well manned
and equipped for the voyage, and in every respect seaworthy;
and that the look-put of the steamer, who was stationed at the
forecastle, while she was proceeding on the voyage, between
seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the weather being
cloudy and the night dark, the wind southwest by south, and
the steamer steering east half south, with her usual lights displayed, discovered the light of avessel about two and a half
points on the starboard bow of the steamer. Whereupon the
helm of the steamer was immediately put to the starboard, and
she at once swung off to east-northeast, and at or -about the
same time her engines were stopped. That vessel so discovered was the brig Alfaretta. She was close hauled on the wind
at the time, and was steering to the westward, as the respondents allege, in a course nearly parallel to that of the steamer;
but, instead of keeping her course, as she should have done,

SUPREME COURT.
New York and LivarooZ U. S. Afail tegmsip Co. v. RumbaL

she suddenly and unexpectedly put her helm to port, and kept
off, and came with her bows on to the steamer, striking her a
little forward of her starboard wheel, which passed over the
bows of the brig, cutting her down and damaging the steamer
to the amount of two thousand dollars. And they explicitly
allege, that if the brig had kept her course, and had not put
per helm to port, the collision would have been avoided. This
statement, derived from the pleadings, exhibits very fully the
real nature of the controversy between the parties, and the
grounds assumed on the one side and the other in the prosecution and defence of the suit. Testimony was taken on both
sides, in the District Court, and, after hearing, a decree was
entered that the libel be dismissed, each party paying their
own costs, and the libellant appealed to the Circuit Court.
Both parties appeared by counsel in the Circuit Court, and,
after a full hearing, it was ordered and adjudged that the decree of the District Court dismissing the libel be in all things
reversed, and that the libellant do recover the damages sustained by reason of the collision, together with costs in both
courts, and that the cause be referred to a commissioner to
ascertain and report the damages. Additional testimony was
taken before the commissioner, who reported that the sum of
seven thousand one hundred and seven dollars and nineteen
cents was due to the libellants, to which report the respondents excepted; and, after the hearing upon the exceptions,-the
report was confirmed by the court, and a decree entered that
the libellant recover the sum reported with costs. Whereupon
a final decree was entered, in pursuance of the report, and the
respondents appealed to this court. Many of the facts and circumstances attending the disaster, as well as those which preceded it, are so fully proved that they cannot properly be regarded as the subject of dispute. As alleged in the libel, the
collision took place in the open sea, on the sixteenth day of
August, 1851, some fifteen or twenty miles off the southern
shore of Long Island. It occurred a little past eight o'clock in
the evening, after the officers in charge of the respective vessels
had been fully apprised of the approaching danger, and under
circumstances which make it manifest that it ought to have

been prevented. both vessels had proper lights at the time,
and competent and sufficient look-outs; and it is clearly proved
that the duties of the look-outs were vigilantly and promptly
performed. Lights had not been set on the brig when her lookout first discerned the light of the steamer from the forward
part of the vessel. One had been prepared, however, and
lighted by the steward, and was-in the galley forward of the
house on the deck, ready for that purpose. On seeing the light
of the steamer, the look-out bf the brig at once reported the fact
to the master, who was then walking the deck, and he immediately caused the light, which was burning brightly, to be
hoisted in the fore rigging of the brig, and it was kept there,'
in full view of the hpproaching steamer, until the vessels came
together. Coffin, who hoisted the light, and was the look-out
on the brig, -testifies that he tied the light just under the foreyard, and renained standing in the rigging, watching the light
of ihe kteamer as she approached, until she was so near that
he-had just time to descend to the deck and take a few steps
aft when the vessels struck. He says it was about fifteen minutes after he reported the light of the steamer to the master of.
the brig that the collision occurred; and, in this particular, he
is strongly confirmed by the mate of the steamer, who admits
that the brig was about three miles distant when her light was
-reported to him, as the officer of *the.deck, by the look-out on
the starboard bow of the steamer. At the time the light of
the steamer was first seen.by the look-out, the brig was sailing
on a course of northwest by west, close hauled on the wind,
with her larboard tacks aboard, and all her sails set. She was
converging towards the track of the steamer, and was going
through the water only three .or four miles an hour, the wind
being light, and blowing from the southwest by west.
Several witnesses describe the character of the night as overcast, and some speak of it as cloudy, with intervening stars ;
but all agree that it was not unusually dark. They all concur
in saying that the surface of the sea was smooth, and there was
no hize or mist on the water; and the mate of the steamer
testifies that objects could be seen without lights at ihe distance
of three miles.

SUPREME COURT.
New York and Live2yool U S. Aail Steamship Co. v. Rumball.

When the steamer discovered the brig, she had all her signal
lights displayed, and was on a course of east half south, and
was moving through the water at the rate of twelve or thirteen
miles an hour, using all her sails as well as her engines. Her
mate and look-out first saw the light of the brig, and they testify that the bearing of the light was some two and a half
points off the starboard bow of the steamer. Their statements, however, do not entirely agree with the testimony of the
master. He was in his room at the time, calculating the position
of the steamer, and did not hear the light of the brig reported.
While there, he heard the mate call out, '"hard a-starboard,"
and instantly went up on to the paddle-box of the steamer.
liis~account of the bearing of the brig is not entirely clear,
as given in the record, or very satisfactory. At first, he says
he saw the brig two and a half to three points off the starboard
bow of the steamer, but finally fixes it at two points; and adds,
to the effect that she was not over one-third of a mile distant.
lie admits, however, that the steamer was then swinging off
rapidly towards Long Island shore; and of course, if the bearing was only two points when the master reached the paddlebox, it must have been much less than two and a half points
at the time the light was first discovered, as the vessels were
then three miles apart, and the order of the mate, to starboard
the helm, had not then been given; and of course the steamer
did not.commence to swing off to port till after that order was
given and executed.
According to the testimony of the mate, his first order, after
seeing the light of the brig, was to starboard the helm, and
then, he says, the vessel began to swing off; and it was not
until after he left the position he then occupied, and went
on to the paddle-box, that he gave the order, hard a-starboard.
After that order was given, and the usual response received
from the wheelsman, then, he says, the master came by his
side, and repeated the order, adding that "the vessel will be
into us-stop her;" and the mate says that the steamer had
then swung off about three points; and yet the master says
that the bearing of the light of the brig was still two points off
the starboard bow of the steamer.

New York and Liverpood U. S. .Mtail Steamshp Co. v. RumbaZ.

Statements so conflicting and uncertain do not fuinish any
definite elements which can safely be made the basis of a reliable mathematical calculation as to the precise bearing of the
brig when her light was first seen, and are not entitled to much
consideration in determining the question how the collision
was produced.
Some uncertainty also exists as to the precise bearing of the
steamer when her light was first discovered from the brig. It
is stated in the libel as about west half south, and the testimony of the witnesses is equally indefinite. One witness estimates it at about three points off the larboard bow of the brig;
another says it was about two points in the sam e direction;
and a third, witness says it was about west. Such indefinite
statements cannot afford much aid in determining the principal question involved in this controversy.
Whatever may have been the precise position of the vessels
with respect to each other at the time the light of the steamer
was first discovered by the look-out of the brig, it is certain
that the course of the brig was converging towards the track
of the steamer, and that they came together in the course of
fifteen minutes after the light was reported to the master; and
the brig was run down and lost. It was the starboard bow of
the steamer which came in. contact with the larboard bow of
the brig, forward of the fore-swifter, and slewed her round,
carrying away her bowsprit, foremast, and main-topmast, and
cutting her down to the water's edge; and -suph was the headway of the steamer at the time, that she swept on for a considerable distance, without any apparent abatement of her speed,
notwithstanding her engines were stopped and reversed just
before the collision took place.
All the circumstances tend to show that the disaster might
have been prevented, and that there was fault somewhere, for
which the offending party ought to be held responsible. Both
parties appear to have so understood the matter when they
made up their pleadings, as -well as in the subsequent conduct
of the capse.
It is alleged in the libel that the brig kept her course after
the lighit of the steamer was seen, without any deviationi until

the collision occurred. On the part of the respondents, that
allegation in the libel is denied; and they allege that the brig,
when her light was first seen, was steering to the westward,
close hauled on the wind, and in a course nearly parallel to
the steamer; but instead of keeping her course, as she should
have done, that she suddenly and unexpectedly put her -helm
up, kept off, and came with her bows on to the steamer.
Such is, the issue, as made up by the parties in the pleadings,
and it presents the principal question of fact to be determined
by the court.
Our views upon the point cannot be stated in a manner
which would be satisfactory to those interested, without some
brief reference to the evidence on which they are based.
When the disaster occurred to the brig, her whole company,
consisting of seven men, including the master and mate, were
on the deck of the vessel, and witnessed the events. Four
were examined as witnesses; and the mate testifies that it was
the watch of the master, who, being the libellant and one of
the owners of the vessel, was not examined. His watch commenced at eight o'clock in the evening, when the preceding
watch closed. From six to eight o'clock, the mate had charge
of the deck, and he says that the course of the brig at sunset
was northwest by west; that she was sailing close hauled
on the wind, and continued on the same course until eight
o'clock, when he went below. He remained below until he
heard a light reported, when he immediately went on deck,
and at first saw only one light, but, as the vessel approached
nearer, he saw more, and supposed it was a steamer; and he
testifies positively that the brig did not change her course, after
he went on deck, until the steamer struck her. On his return
to the deck, he did not look at the compass, but says the brig
was on the wind, with her larboard tacks aboard, and, in his
judgment, was going the same course as when he went below.
Three of the seamen were also examined, and their testimony
is equally full and explicit, and to the same effect. One of
them was the look-out, who first discovered the light of the
steamer, and reported it to the master; and the other two, on
hearing his report, immediately went on deck, and remained

DECEMBER TERM, 1858.

381

througho-t, watching the light as it approached, and with
every opportunity to see and observe whatever transpired on
the deuk of the vessel. Some one or more of them testifies
that the master twice gave the order "to keep her full and by,"
as the steamer advanced, and they all concur that the brig did
not change her course, and that no danger was apprehended
until just before the collision took place. All must admit that
they had ample neans of knowledge upon the subject of their
testimony; and if their statements are incorrect, they must
have wilfully perverted the truth, which is not to be presumed.
Several witnesses, however, examined on the part of the respondents, testify that the brig did change her course before
the vessels camae together; and among the number is the mate
of the steamer, who beyond doubt describes the events truly,
as they appeared to him at the time of the occurrence.
His testimony, as it is exhibited in the record, furnishes conclusive evidence that the two vessels were very close together,
if not in actual contact, when the supposed change of course
-was made, and presents some ground of inference that the jibboom of the steamer, or the rigging connected with the bowsprit, as they swept over the stem of the brig, or pressed against
her fore rigging, may have produced the state of things which
induced him to think that the brig bad ported her helm. At
first he said the change was made just before the collision, then
immediately before it; but, upon further interrogation, he said
it was before the jib-boom of the brig had touched the steamer,
and .finally added that the brig might have been twice the
leigth of the ship off All of his statements, however, are
based upon the theory that the brig ran into the steamer, when
it is satisfactorily shown that the real state of the case was the
reverse. It was the bow of the steamer, near the cat-heads,
which struck the jib-boom of the brig, and carried it away; and
the evidence furnishes strong reasons to conclude that the brig
had been partly slewed round just before that occurred. Be
that as it 'may, it is certain from the evidence that the brig kept
her course until just before the collision took place. When
the mate of the steamer first saw her light, he says itwas about
three miles distant, and he admits that her direction then was

.882

north of west, and that he did not notice any change of her
course, except the one already mentioned, when the vessels
were close together. When the master went up on to the
paddle-box of the steamer, and repeated the order previously
given by the mate to put the helm hard a-starboard, he says
the brig was then sailing close hauled on the wind, and that the
two vessels were not more than a third of a mile apart. His
account of the change of course is, that it was made after that
order was given, and he says the brig instantly turned directly
across the bows of the steamer, and came right into her, thus
showing conclusively that the alleged change, however produced, was made at the moihent of collision. These references
to the testimony of the witnesses must suffice, and they are
believed to be amply sufficient to show what the state of the
evidence is, as it is exhibited in the record. One remark is
applicable to all of the witnesses introduced by the respondents; and that is, they had not the same means of knowledge
respecting the matter in dispute as the witnesses for the libellant possessed, who had charge of the brig, and governed her
course; and in weighing the evidence, and determining its force
and effect, that important consideration cannot be overlooked.
It must be admitted that the witnesses on the part of the libellant speak from actual knowledge, and, unless they have wilfully stated wihat they know to be false, their statements must
be correct. They were on the deck of the vessel, interested,
so far as their personal safety was concerned, to observe everything that transpired as the steamer approached, and they cannot well be mistaken in respect to the matter under consideration.
Those on board the steamer appear in the record under very
different circumstances. They only infer what they have affirmed as to what transpired on the deck of the brig, and at
best their statements respecting the matters in question are of
the nature of opinions, and it is not difficult to see that they
may be in error. In the excitement and confusion of the moment,
they may have mistaken what was occasioned by the momentum
of the steamer or the pressure of her bowsprit or jib-boom upon
the stem or fore rigging,of the brig, for a change of course pro.

-

duced by an alteration of her helm. All the testimony tends
to show that the two vesselscame together at an obtuse'angle,
and there is much reason to think that the brig had been
pressed out of her course before the bows of the vessels came
together. At all events, such an inference from the evidence'
is far more reasonable than would be the conclusion that all
the witnesses for the libellants have wilfully perverted the
truth. Other grounds of reconciling the testimony consistent
with the integrity of all the witnesses might be suggested, but
we think it unnecessary, as the evidence clearly shows that the
-brig kept her, course, without any change whatever, until the
peril was impending and the collision inevitable.
An error committed by those in charge of a vessel under such
circumstances, if the vessel was otherwise without fault, would
not impair her right to recover for the injuries occasioned by
the collision, for the plain reason that those who produced the
peril and put the vessel in that situation would be chargeable
with the error, and must answer for the consequences.
Our conclusion, however, on this branch of the case, is' that
the respondents have failed to support the allegation of the
answer, that the brig changed her course after the light of the
steamer was discovered, and that the evidence satisfactorily
shows that she did not change her course in any sense which
can b6 regarded as a fault. Sailing vessels when approaching
a steamer are required to keep their course; and steamers, under
such circumstances, as a general rule, are required to keep out
of the way. Many considerations concur to show that all those'
engaged in navigating vessels upon the seas arebound to observe the nautical rules recognised and approved by the courts,
in the management of their vessels oi approaching 6 point
where there is danger of collision. Those rules were framed
and are administered to prevent such disasters and to afford
security to life and property exposed to such dangers; and public policy, ap well as the best iiiterest of all concerned, requires
that they should be constantly'and rigidly enforced in all cases
to which they apply. Few cases can be imagined where it is
more needfu.l that they should be observed than when a steamer
and a sailing vessel are approaching each other from opposite

directions, or on intersecting lines, for the obvious reason that
the negligence of the one is liable to baffle the vigilance of the
other; and if one of the vessels under such ciicumstances follows the rule, and the other omits to do so, or violates it, a collision is almost'certain to follow:
Rules of navigation, such as have been mentioned, are obligatory upon vessels approaching each other, from the time the
necessity for precaution begins, and continue to be applicable
as the vessels advance, so long. as the means and opportunity
to avoid the danger remain. They do not apply to a vessel
required td keep her course after the approach is so near that
the collision is inevitable, and are equally inapplicable to yes.
sels of every description, while they are yet so distant from
each other that measures of precaution have not become necessary to avoid a collision. Sailing vessels approaching a steamer
are required to keep their course on account of the correlative
duty which is devolved upon the steamer to keep out of the
way, in order that the steamer may know the position of the
object to be avoided, and may not be led into error in her endeavor to comply with the requirement.
Under the rule that a steamer must keep out of thc way, she
must of necessity determine for, herself and upon her own responsibility, independently of the sailing vessel, whether it is
safer to go to the ' right or left, or to stop; and in order that
she may not be deprived of the means of determining the matter wisely, and that she may not'be defeated or baffled in the
atempt to perform her duty in the emergency, it is required
in the admiralty jurisprudence of the United States that the
sailing vessel shall keep her course, and allow the steamer to
pass either on the right or left, or to adopt such measures of
precaution as she may deem best suited to enable her to perform her duty and fulfil the requirement of the law to keep
out of the way.
Repeated decisions of this court have affirmed the doctrine
here laid down, and carried it out to its logical conclusion, and
in so many instances that the question cannot any longer be
regarded as open to dispute. Accordingly, it was held in the
case of the steamer Oregon v. Rocca et al., (18 How., 570,) that

DECEMBER TERM, 1858.

885,

New York and Liverool U. S. HfaiZ Steamship Co. v. RumbaZ.

when a steamer approaches a sailing vessel, the steamer is required to exercise the necessary precautions to avoid a collision;
and if this-be not done, primafacie the steamer is chargeable
with fault., That decision was founded upon the rule previously established in St. John v. Paine et al., (10 How., 583,)
"where-the whole subject is elaborately'considered, and the reasons of the rule fully explained. "Similarviews are also maintained in the case of the Genesee-Chief, (12 How., 461,) and in
various other cases to the lresent time. Exceptional- cases
may be imagined in a crowded thoroughfare, where the rule
would not be applicable, but those will be considered when
they arise. Such precautions as are inculcated in the rule referred to are enjoihed, as before remarked, to prevent collision
and afford security t& life 'and property; and in a case whfere
the rule could not be followed Without defeating the end for
which it was established, or without producing the mischief
which it was the design of the rule to avert, of course it would
not be applicable,.and in such a case a departure from it would
be both justifiable and commendable. Extreme cases, such as
are supposed, will rarely if ever occur, and in referring to them
it must not be understood that the rule will be relaxed to any
extent whatever in other cases to which it properlir applies..
Applying these principl6s to the case under consideration,'it
is obvious what the result must be. It is not denied that the
collision took place, and that the brig was run down and lost;
and such being the fact, and the evidence exhibited failing to
satisfy the court that the brig was in fault, or the disaster inevitable, it necessarily follows that the collision was the result
of fault on the part of the steamer, and that the steamer is answerable to the libellant for the damage.
Our attention was also drawn, 'at the argument, to the amount
of the damage as reported by the commissioner, and iA was
insisted that it is excessive. .On that point it will be sufficient
to say, that after a careful examination of the testimony before
him, we see no ground to doubt that bis duty was rightly performed.
'The decre6 of the Circuit Court, therefore, is atrmed, with
