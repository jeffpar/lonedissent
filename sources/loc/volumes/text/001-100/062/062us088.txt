action of ejectment the case was submitted to the court upon
the evidence, without the intervention of a jury, leaving it to
thd court to decide the fact, as well as the law, upon the evidence and admissions before it. The case, therefore, is the
same in principle with that of Guild and others v. Frontin, 18
How., 185. And the doctrine in that case was reaffirmed in
Suydam v. Williamson, 20 How., 428, and the grounds upon
which it rests fully set forth. It is unnecessary to repeat here
what was stated in these two decisions. It is sufficient to say
that the agreement of parties cannot authorize this court to revise a judgment of an inferior court in any other mode of proceeding than that which the law prescribes, nor can the laws of
a State, regulating the proceedings of its own courts, authoize
a district or Circuit Court sitting in. the State to depart from
the modes of proceeding and rules prescribed by the acts of
Congress.
The judgment of the Circuit Court must therefore be af.
firmed.
ROSS WINANS, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, v. THE TEW YORK AND
ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY.
Where objection was made, during the trial of a cause, to the reception of the deposition of a witness, which had been taken under a commission, it was properly
overruled, because the rules of practice in the Circuit Court of New York give
time and opportunity to move for a suppression of'the deposition or a re-examination of the witness.
The paper which the witness referredto, but did not annex to his deposition, was
not in his power.
In the trial of a suit for the violation of a patent right, the court cannot be compelled to receive the evidence of experts as to how a patent ought to be construed. The judge may obtain information from them, if he desire it.
Winans's patent for "a new and useful improvement in the construction of cars or
carriages intended to travel upon railroads," was for the manner of arranging
and connecting the eight wheels of a railroad carriage for the purpose of enabling burden and passenger cars to pursue a more smooth, even, and safe
course over the curves and irregularities of a railroad. And it was proper to
instruct the jury, thatif they found, from the evidence, that before the time when
Winans claimed to have made the discovery, carriages with eight wheels, arranged and connected substantially in 'the same manner and upon the same
mechanical principles with those described in the patent, were known, and
publicly used, Winans was not entitled to recover.

.DECEMBER TERM, 1858.
Winans v. New York and Ene BRtiroad Company.

THIS case was brought up by writ of error from the Circuit Court of the United States for the northern district of
New York
It was an action brought by Winans against the railroad
company for a violation of his patent for a new -aid useful improvement m the construction of cars or carriages intended to
travel upon railroads.
In order that the reader may understand the nature of the
inprovement, the description of it, as given by Winans himself; is here inserted, because it is remarkably clear and well
drawn up.
The following is the schedule referred to m the letters patent:
"To all whom it may concern. Be it known, that I, Ross
Winans, civil engineer, of the city of Baltimore, in the State
of Maryland, have invented a new and useful improvemeni in
the construction of cars or carriages intended to travel upon
railroads; which improvement is particularly adapted to passenger cars, as will more fully appear by an exposition of the
difficulties heretofore experienced in the running of such-cars
at high velocities, which exposition I think it best to give in
this specification, for the purpose of exemplifying the more
clearly the object of my said'improvement.
"In the construction of all railroads in this country which
extend to any considerable distance, it has been found necessary to admit of lateral curvatures, the radius of which is sometimes but a few hundred feet; and it becomes important, therefore, so to construct the cars- as to enable them to overcome
the difficulties presented by such curvatures, and to adapt them
for running with the least friction practicable upon all parts of
the road, the friction to which I now allude is that which
arises from the contact between the flanclies of the wheels and
the-rails, which, when it occurs, causes a great loss of power,
and a rapid destruction of; or injury to, both the wheel and
the rail, and is otherwie injurious. The high velocities attained by the improvements made in locomotive engines, and
which are not only sanctioned, but demandedby public opinion, render it necessary that certain points of-construction and

SUPREME COURT.
Winans v.,New York and .,re.ailioad Company.

arrangement, both -inthe roads and wheels, which were not
viewed as important at former rates of travelling, should now
receive special attention.- Thegreater momentum of the load;
and the intensity of 'the.,sho ks and. concussions, which are
unavoidable, even under the best constructions, are among
those circumstances which must not 'be neglected, as the liability to accident is thereby not only greatly increased, but the
consequences to be apprehended much more serious. The
passenger and other cars in general use upon railroads, have
four wheels, the axles of which are placed from three and a
,half to ,five feet apart; this distance being governed by the na
ture of the road upon which they run, and other considerations. When the cars are so constructed that the axles retain
their parallelism, and are at a considerable distance apart,
there is a necessary tendency in the flanches of the wheels to
come into contact with the rails, especially on the curvatures
of least radius, as the axles then vary more from the direction
of the radii. From this consideration, when taken -alone, it
would appear to be best to place the axles as near to each
other as possible, thus causing them to approach more nearly
to the direction of the radii of the curves, and the planes of the
wheels to conform to the line of the rails. There are, however, other circumstances which must not be overlooked in
their constructions. I have already alluded to the increased
force of the shocks from obstructions at high velocities--and,
whatever care may be taken, there will be inequalities in the
rails and wheels, which, though small, are numerous, and the
perpetual operation of which produces effects which cannot be
'disregarded. The greater the distance between the axles,
while the length of the body remains the same, the less is the
influence of these shomks or concussions; and this has led, in
many instances, to the placing them in passenger cars, at or
near their extreme ends. Now, however, a compromise is
most commonly made between the evils resulting from a considerable separation and a near approach, as, by the modes of
construction now iw use, one of the advantages must be sacrificed to the other. But it is not to the lateral curvatures and
_nequalities of the road alone that the foregoing remarks ap

ply. The incessant vibration felt in travelling over a railroad
is mainly dependent upon the vertical motion of the cars in
surmounting those numerous though minute obstructions
which unavoidably exist. The nearer the axles are placed to
each other, the greater is the effect of this motion upon the
passengers, and the greater its power to derange. the machinery and the road. It becomes very important, therefore, both
as regards comfort, safety, and economy, to devise a mode of
combining the advantages derived from placing the axles at a
considerable distance apart, with those of allowing them to be
situated near:to each other. It has been attempted, and with
some success, to correct the tendency of. the filanches to come
into contact with the rails, on curved and other parts of the
road, by making the tread of the wheel conical, and if the,
travelling upon railroads was not required to be very rapid,
this would so far prove an effectual corrective, as the two rails
would find diameters upon the wheels which would correspond
with the difference in length, the constant tendency to deviation being as constantly counteracted by this construction,
but at high velocities, the momentum of the body in motion
tends so powerfully to carry it in a right line, as to cause the
wheel on the longer rail to ascend considerably above that part
,of the .cone which corresponds therewith. The consequence "of
this is, a continued serpentine motion, principally, but not entirely, in a lateral direction, nor is this confined to the curved
parts of the road, but it exists to an equal -or greater extent
upon those which are straight, especially when the axles are
near to each other, the irregularities before spoken of constantly changing the direct course of the wheels, whilst there
is no general curvature of the rails to counteract it. To avoid
this effect, and the unpleasant motion and tendency to de,rangement consequent upon it, an additional motive is furnished for placing the axles at a considerable distance apart.
"The object of my. invention is, among other things, to
make such an adjustment or arrangement of the wheels and
axles as shall cause the-body of the car or carnage to pursue a
more smooth, even, direct, and safe course, than it does as cars
are ordinarily constructed, both over the curved and straight.

SUPREME COURT.
Winans v. New York and Ere Rai7-oad Company.

parts of the road, by the before-mentioned desideratum of
combining the advantages of the near and distant coupling of
the axles, and other means to be hereinafter described. For
this purpose, Cconstruct two bearing carriages, each with four
wheels, which are to sustain the body of the passenger or
other car by placing one of them at or near each end of it, in
a way to be presently described. The two wheels on either
side of these carriages are to be placed very near to each other;
the spaces between their flanches need be no greater than is
necessary to prevent their contact with each other. These
wheels I connect together by means of a very strong spnng-say doable the usual strength employed for ordinary cars--the
ends of which spring are bolted, or otherwise secured, to the
upper sides of the boxes, which rest on the journals of the
axles, the longer leaves of the-springs being placed downwards,
and surmounted'by the shorter leaves. Having thus connected two pairs of wheels together, I unite them into a four-wheel
bearing carnage, by means of their axles, and a bolster of the
proper length extending across, between the two pairs of
wheels, from the centre of one spring to that of the other, and
securely fastened to the tops of them. 'This bolster must be
of sufficient strength to. bear a load upon its centre of four or
five tons. Upon this first bolster I place another of equal
strength, and connect the two together by a centre pm or bolt
passing down through them, and thus allowing them to swivel
or turn upon each other in the manner of the front bolster of
a common road: wagon. I prefer making these bolsters of
wrought or cast iron, wood, however, may be used. I prepare each of the bearing carriages in precisely the same way
The body of the-passenger or other car I make of double the
ordinary length of those which run on four wheels, and capable of-carrying double their load. This body I place so as to
rest its whole weight upon the two upper bolsters of the two
before-mentioned bearing carriages or running gear. I sometimes place these bolsters so far within the ends of the body
of the car as to bring all the wheels under it, and in this case
less strength is necessary in the car body than when the bolster is situated at its extreme ends. In some cases, however;

DECEMBER TERM, 1858.

98

Winans v. .N'w York and BRe Railroad Company.

I place the bolster so far without the body of the car, at either
end, as to allow the latter to hang down between the two sets
of wheels or bearing carriages, and to run, if desired, within a
foot of the rails.
" When this is done, a strong frame-work projects out from
either end of the car or carnage body, and rests upon the upper.bolsters of the two bearing carriages. This last arrangement, by which the body of the 'car is hung so low down,
.manifestly affords a great security to the passengers, exempting'them in a great degree from those accidents to which they
are liable when the load is raised. .Several bodies may be connected, or rest on a common frame, and be supported on the
bearing carriage, in a manner similar to that of a single body
When the bolsters of the bearing carriages are placed under
the extreme ends of the body, the relief from shocks and concussions, and from lateral vibrations, is greater than it is when
the bolsters are placed between the middle and the ends of the
body, and this relief is not materially varied by increasing or
diminishing the length of the body, while the extreme ends
of it continue to rest on the bolsters of the bearing cars, the
load supposed to be equally distributed over the entire length
of the body
"Although I prefer the use of a single spring to a pair of
wheels as above described, instead of the ordinary spring to
each wvheel, and consider it as more simple, cheap, and convenient than any other arrangement, the end which I have in
view may nevertheless be obtained by constructing the bearing carriages in any of the modes usually practiced, provided
that the fore and hind wheels of each of them be placed very
near together; because the closeness of the fore and hind wheels
of each bearing carriage, taken in connection with the use of
two bearing carriages coupled remotely from eachpther as can
conveniently be done, for the support of one body, with a; view
to the objects and on the principles herein set forth, is considered by me as a most important feature of my invention, fo,
by the contiguity of the fore and hind wheels of each 'bearing
carriage, while the two bearing carriages may be at any desirable distance apart, the lateral friction- from the rubbing of the

Winans v. New York and Ens Baileoad Company.

flanches against the rails is most effectually avoided, whilst at
the same time all the advantages attendant upon placing the
axles of a four-wheeled car far apart are thus obtained. The
beong of the load on the centre of the bolster, which also is
the centre of each bearing carriage, likewise affords great relief
from the shocks occasioned by the percussions of the wheels
on protuberant parts of the rails or other objects, and from the
vibrations consecluent to the use of coned wheels; as the-lateral and vertical movements of the body of the car resulting
from the above causes are much diminshed. The two wheels
on either side of one of the bearing carriages may, from their
proximity, be considered as acting like a single wheel, and as
these two bearing carnages may be placed at any distance from
each other, consistent with the required strength of the body
of the car, it is evident that all the advantage is obtained which
results from having the two axles of a four-wneeled car at a
distance from each other, whilst its inconveniences are avoided.
Another advantage of this car, compared with those in common use, and which is viewed by me as very important, is the
increased safety afforded by it to passengers, not only from the
diminished liability to breakage, or derangement in the frame
work, but also from the less disastrous consequences to be apprehended from the breaking of a wheel, axle, or other part
of the running gear, as the car body depends for its support
and safety upon a greater number of wheels and bearing points
on the road. I do not claim as my invention the running of
cars or carriages upon eight wheels, this having been previously done, not, however, in thlemanner or for the purposes
herein described, but merely with a view of distributing the
weight, carried more evenly upon a rail or other road and for
objects distinct in character from those which I have had in
view, as hereinbefore set forth. INor have the wheels, when
thus increased in number, been so arranged and connected
with each other, either by design or accident, as to accomplish this purpose. What I claim, thefore, as my invention,
,and for which I ask a patent, is, the before-described manner
of arranging and -connecting the eight wheels, which constitute the two bearing carriages, with a railroad car, so as to.

principles.
The patent was originally issued in 1834, and continued reg7ilafly until.1848, when it was extended by the Commissioner
of Patents for seven years from the 1st of October, 1848.
The defendants pleaded the general issue3 and gave notice
under the statute that Winans was not the original inventor,
but that, substantially, the- same contrivance was described in
many books, known to many persons, and used in many-places.
Other grounds of defence were also.mentioned. The case came
on for trial in June, 1856, when the jury found a verdict for
the defendants.
The first exception was to the admission of the testimony of
Conduce Gatch, a witness for the defendant, who had been examined under a commission. The questions and answers were
as follows:
"One hundredth cross-interrigatory Did you, before answering the said -direct interrogatories, or the said cross-interrogatories, or any of them, see or read, or hear read, or hear
stated, any pare of, or the substance of any part of, any testimony given or affidavit made. by you, or by any other person
or persons, in the case of Ross Winans against the Eastern
Railroad Company, or in the case of Ross Winans against Orsai us Eaton and otherg or in the case of Ross -Winans against
the New York and Harlem Railroad Company 9 And, if yea,
in what case was such testimony or affidavit given, and by
whom was the same read or shown, or stated to you, or to any
other person or persons in your presence or hearing?"
To this, Gatch answered:
"X 100th. To the onehundredth cross-interrogatoryhe saith

interrogatories, when I was before him for the purpose of giving my d-epositibn in this case,, it struck, me forcibly that the
questions, if not identically the same, .were the same in substaice of those I had answered in the cas- of Winans against
the lew York and Harlem Railroad Company, ani'upon ascertaining that the commissioner had a copy of the answers I

Winans v. New York and Erw Railroad Company.

then gave, and for the purpose of facilitating the execution of
this commission, I adopted the answers before referred to, altering them in some particulars so as to be more explicit, and
I-now declare that, independent of seeing the copy of my
answers, the facts I have herein testified to are true."
The one hundred and second cross-interrogatory was too
long to be inserted. 'It inquired whether he had heard, read,
or stated, any paper, &c., &c., and if any suggestion had been
made in writing- &c., to annex a copy of such writing.
To which Gatch answered.
"To the-one hundred and second cross-interrogatory he saith
I refer to my answer to the one hundredth cross-interrogatory"
Upon the trial, the counsel for the plaintiff moved to exclude
the whole testimony of Gatch, because he did not annex the
writing to his answer. - But the court overruled the objection
and'admitted the evidence, which constituted the first exception.

After this, there were thirty-one exceptions taken, viz. nine
to the refusal of the court to allow the plaintiff to prove certain matters whch he offered to prove, fourteen to various
parts of the charge of the court, and eight to refusals by the
court to charge the jury in accordance with the prayers of the
plaintiff.
As the first class of exceptions is particularly noticed in the
opinion ofthis court, it is proper to mention the circumstances
under which they were taken.
After the defendants had rested their case, and after the
plamtiff had thereafter put in a part of his evidence in reply,
the plaintiff made to the court the following offer to prove the
facts and matters stated in said offer, namely"1. The plaintiff, by his counsel, offers to prove that the
action of coned wheels, specified in the patent, requires the
wheels to be fast on, and turn with their axles. That at the
time the plaintiff's patent was granted, it was the general practice, in constructing cars for running at high velocities, to construct them with coned wheels, fast on and turning with their
axles, and that non-coned wheels, or coned wheels turning on
their axles, are not equivalent for,. and cannot produce, the

effects described in the patent as peculiar to the use of coned
wheels."
The defendants objected to the proving of any of the facts
and matters stated in said offer, on the ground that all of said
facts and matters were immaterial and irrelevant, and the court
sustained said objection, and. refused to allow the plaintif to
prove any of the-facts and matters stated in said offer, to which
sustaining and refusal the plantiff then and there duly and in
due time 'excepted.
The plaintiff then made to the court the following offer to
prove the facts and matters stated in said offer, namely"2. The plaintiff, by his counsel, ofers to prove, that the
end proposed in the specification of the plaintiff's patent cannot be ,efected by a car having two swivelling four-w eeled
tracks connected with a body-or platform, unless the wheels of
the bearing carriages are coned on their treads, and are fast on,
and turn with their axles."
The defendants objected to the proving of any of the facts
and matters stated in said last-mentioned offer, on the ground
that all of said facts and matters were-immaterial and irrelevant;
and the court sustained said last-mentioned objection, and re
of the facts and matfused to allow the plaintiff to prove iany
ters stated in said last-mentioned offer, to which last-men.
tioned sustaining and refusal the plaintiff then and there duly
and in due time excepted.
These two offers of proof by the plaintiff sufficienty show
the character of the proof offered, and which the court ruled
out. The remaining seven were similar in their character.
The exceptions to the charge of the court when construing
the patent are too voluminous to be inserted, as are also the.
prayers to the court on behalf of the plaintiff.
.Uponall these exceptions the case came up to this court It was argued by -Hr Bktckford and Ar Kelkr for the plain
tiff in error, and .Mr Dams and MrM Whiting for .the defendants.
In the argument of a pAtent ease, it. is impossible to .give to

Winans v. New York and Erte Railroad Company.

models were produced, without which all attempts at explanation would be superfluous.
Mr. Justice GRIER delivered the opilion of the court.

The patent which the defendants are charged to have infringed purports to be, "for a new and useful improvement in
the construction of cars or carriages intended to travel upon
railroads,"
The specification comunences with an enumeration of the
difficulties attending short curves in 'railroads from friction,
and the consequent necessity of placing the wheels, where four
only are used, near together. But in high velocities the shocks
from obstructions or inequalities on the rails are thus greatly
increased, so that a compromise is usually made between the
evils consequent on too great a separation and too near approach, wherein the advantage of one is necessarily sacrificed
for.the sake of the other. The incessant vibration felt in travelling on railroad cars is mainly imputed to the minutezobstructions which unavoidably exist, and the approximation of the
wheels necessary to avoid frietion tends to increase the effect of
this motion, and its power to derange the machinery of the rodd.
The important object which the plaintiff's invenition seeks
to obtain, as regards comfort, safety, and economy, "is to devise a mode of combining the advantages derived from placing
the axles at a considerable distance, with those of allowing
them to be situated near each other."
' The specification then states the methods heretofore used to
remedy these difficulties, such as making the 'track wheels
case of slow travelling, has been found an
conical, which, in,
effectual correction. But in high velocities it oauseda serpentine motion, -not only on curves, but where the track was
straight. To avoid this effect, an additional motive is furnished
for. placing the axles at a considerable. distance apart.
For this purpose the-patentee proposes to construct two bearing carriages, each with four wheels, to sustain the body of
the carsone at or near each end thereof; the two wheela on
either siae of these carriages to be placed verynear each other.
These wheels may be connected by a strong spring, double the

usual strength employed- for ordinary cars. The use of this
spring, though preferable, is not absolutely required, as the end
in view may be obtained by constructing the b'earingcarrages
in any of the modes usually practiced, provided the fore and
hind wheels of each of the carriages be placed near together;
because the closeness of the fore and hind wheels of each-bearing carnage, coupled remotely from each other, is considered
as the most important feature of the mv'ention.
On each of these carriages a bolster is placed, on which the
car body rests, connected with each by a centre pin or bolt
passing down through them, thus allowing them to swivel or
turn upon each'other.
After this description of the improvement contemplated, and
the objects to be gained by it, .(of which we have given a brief
summary,) the specification concludes with the-following disclaimer and statement of what the patentee claims to have invented
"I do not claim as my invention the running of cars or carriages upon eight -wheels, this having. been previously done,
not, however, in the manner or for the. purposes -herein described, but merely with a view of distributing the weight carried more evenly upon a; rail or other road, and for objects distinct in character from those which. I have had in View, as
hereinbefore set forth. -Nor tave the wheels, when thus increased in: number, been so arranged and connected with each
other, either by design or accident, as to accomplish this putpose. What I claim, therefore; as my inventioni and for which
E ask a patent; is, the before-described manner of arranging
ana connecting the eight wheels, which constitute the two bear'
ing carriages, with a railroad car, so as- to accomplish the end
proposed by the means set forth, or by any others which are
analogous and dependent upon the same principles."
'The defence set up iii the pleadings does not de'iiy that de.
fendants use cars constructed as described in the patent, but
takes issue on the originality of the invention, averring, among
numerous other matters, that the same, or substantially the
same, improvement had been previously made and used on the
Quincy railroad, near Boston.

SUPREME COURT.
Winans v. New York and Erze Railroad Company.

The first bill of exceptions taken on the trial is to the refusal
of the court to Teject a deposition taken on interrogatories,
because the witness had not annexed to it a copy of a formet
deposition, which, in answer to a previous interrogatory, he
admitted he had seen and had used to refresh his memory
There are two sufficient reasons why this exception cannot
be sustained. 1. By the rules of practice in force in the Circuit Court, such an objection cannot be made on the thal of a
cause, when the party, as in this case, had full time and opportunity to move for a suppression of the deposition or a re-examination .of the witness.
And, secondly, the paper was not in the- power of the witness, but in that of the commissioner, or the plaintiff himself;
who might have used it if he thought proper.
After the parties had each given evidence tending to prove
the issues between them, and the defendants had closed their
testimony, the plaintiff's counsel made nine distinct offers of
proof, which were severally overruled as irrelevant, and exception taken.
They then proposed eight -several instructions, which they
requested the court to give to the jury, and took exceptions to
the court's refusal. Besides all this, the charge was parcelled
out into fourteen paragraphs, and an exception taken to each.
To state each one of these thirty-one propositions at length,
and discuss them severally, would be a tedious as well as an
unprofitable labor.
There was in fact but one question to be decided -by the
court, viz. the construction of the patent; the question of novelty being the fact to be passed on by the jury
The testinony of expers which was rejected had no relevancy to the facts on which the jury were to pass, but seemed
rather to be intended to instruct .the dourt on some mechanical facts or principles on which the court needed no istruction, or to teach them what was the true construction of the
patent.
Experts may be examined to explain terms of art, and the
state of the art, at any given time. They may explain to the
court and jury the machines, models,. or drawings, exhibited.

DECEMBER TERM, 1858
Winanw v. New York and Erw Railroad Company.

They may point out the difference or identity of the mechanical devices involved in their construction. The maxim of
"cuzque in sua arte eredendum" permits them to be examined to
questions of art or science peculiar to their trade pr profession,
but professors or mechanics cannot be received to prove to the
court or jury what is the proper or legal construction of any
instrument of writing. A judge may obtain information from
them, if he desire it, on matters which he does not clearly comprehend, but cannot be compelled to receive their opinions as
matter of evidence. Experience has shown that opposite opinions of persons professing to be experts may be obtained to any
amount; and it often occurs thdt-not only many days, but even
weeks, are consumed in cross-examinations, to test the skill or
knowledge of such witnesses and the correctness of their opinions, wasting the time and wearying the patience of both court
and jury, and perplexing, instead of elucidating, the questions
involved in the issue.
If the construction given by the court to the spbcification be
correct, and in fact the only construction of which it is capable,
as we think it is, it would be wholly superfluous to examine
experts to teach the court, what they could clearly perceive
without such information, that the necessity for coned wheels.
to avoid friction on curves was a consequence of the fact that
the wheels were fixed to -the axle.
The improvement claimed by the patent being a device to
remedy, among other things, the serpentine or wabbling motion
of such wheels in high velocities, the testimony offered concerning them, if it would have any effect -at.all, would tend
only to mislead both court and jury from the only issue in the
case.
The following extracts*from the charge will show that the
judge has given the only construction' which the language of
this specification will admit, and one which had been previously given by Mr. Chief Justice Taney in 1839, and again.by
Mr. Justice Nelson: "According tQ the import and true construction of the plaintiff's patent and specification, he claims to be the first inventor

and carriages .intended to travel upon railroads,' which improvement consists in the manner of arranging and connecting the
eight wheels, which constitute the two bearing carriages, with
a railroad car, the object of which is to make such an adjustment of the wheels, axles, and bearings of the car, as-shall enable a car with a comparatively long body to pass curves with
greater facility and safety, and less friction, and as shall at the
same time cause the body of the car to pursue a more smooth,
even, direct, and safe course, over the curvatures *and irregularities, and over the straight parts of the road.
"The manner of such arrangement and connection is to place
upon.the upper bolsters of two bearing carriages, each having
four wheels, with the flanches of each pair of wheels very near
together, the body of a car, so as to rest its weight .and have.
the bearing of the load upon the centre or central portion of
'the bolsters, being also the centre or central portion of the
bearing carriages, the bolsters of the bearing carriages and
car body, respectively, being connected by centre pins or bolts,
so as to allow them to swivel and turn upon each other, in the
manner of the front bolster of a common road wagon, and the
bolsters being placed at, near, or beyond, the ends of the body
"And the closeness of the fore and hind-wheels of each of
the two bearing carriages coupled as remotely from each other
as may be desired, or can conveniently be done,- for the support of one body, is a most important feature of the invention,
with a view to the objects and on the principles set forth in
the specification.
"The patentee does not claim to be the inventor of a car

aimed"at, is, that by the contiguity of the fore and hind wheels
of each bearing carriage, and the swivelling motion of the
trucks or bearing carriages, the planes of the flanches of the
wheels conform more nearly to the line of the rails, and the
lateral friction of the flanches on the rails, while entering, passing through, and leaving -curves, is thereby diminished, while

burden car, by means of the -king bolts or centre pins and
bolsters, placed as remotely from each other as may be desired
or can be conveniently done, and with the weightbearing upon
the central portion of the bolsters and bearing carriages, the
