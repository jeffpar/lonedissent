STEPHEN V. R. A .BLEMAN,PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V. SHERMAN M.
BOOTH; AND THE U1ITED STATES, PLAINTIFF IN ERROR, V.
SHERmAN M. BOOTH.
1. The process of a State court or judge has no authority beyond the limits of the
sovereignty which confers the judicial power.
2. A kabeas corpus, issued by a State judge or court, has no authority within the
limits of the sovereignty assigned by the Constitution to the United States. The
sovereignty of the United States and of a State are distinct and independent of
each other within their respective spheres of action, althotigh both exist and
exercise their powers within the same territorial limits.,
S. When a writ of habeas corpus is served on a marshal or other person having
a prisoner in custody under the authority of the United States, it is his duty,
by a proper return, to make known to the State judge or court the authority
by which he holds him. But, at the same time, it is his duty not to obey the
process of the State authority, but to obey and execute the process of the
United States.
4. This court has appellate power in all cases arising under the Constitution and
laws of the United States, with such exceptions and regulations as Congress
may make, whether the cases arise in a State court or an inferior court of the
United States. And, under the act of Congress of 1789, when the decision of
the State court is against the right claimed under the Constitution or laws of
the United States, a writ of error will lie to bring the judgment of the State
court before this court for re-examination and revision.
5. The act of Congress of September 18, 1850, usually called the fugitive slave
law, is constitutional in all its provisions.
6. The commissioner appointed by the District Court of the United States for the
district of Wisconsin had authority to issue his warrant and commit the defend.
ant in error for an offence against the act of September 18, 1850.
7. The District Court of the United States had exclusive jurisdiction to try and
punish the offence; and the validity of its proceedings and judgment -cannot
be re-examined and set aside by any other tribunal
THESE two cases were brought up from the Supreme Court

of the State of Wisconsin by a writ of error issued under the

25th section of the judiciary act.
The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.
They were argued by Mr.Black (Attorney General) for the
plaintiffs in error, no counsel appearing for the defendant.
Mr. Chief Justice TALNEY delivered the opinion of the court.
The plaintiff in -error in the first of these cases is the maishal of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, and the
two cases have arisen out of the same transaction, and depend,
to some extent, upon the same principles. On that account,
they have been argued and considered together; and the following are the facts as they appear in the transcripts before
us:

Sherman M. Booth was charged before Winfield Smith, a
commissioner duly appointed by the District Court of the
United States for the district of Wisconsin, with having, on
the 11th day of March, 1854, aided and abetted, at Milwaukee,
in the said district, the escape of a fugitive slave from the
deputy marshal, who had him in custody under a warrant issued by the district judge of the United States for that district,
under the act of Congress of September 18, 1850.
Upon the examination before the commissioner, he was satisfied that an ofence had been committed as charged, and that
there was probable cause to believe that Booth had been guilty
of it; and thereupon held him to bail to appear and answer
before the District Court of the United States for the district
Lf Wisconsin, on the first Monday in July then next ensuing.
But on the 26th of May his bail or surety in the recognisance
delivered him to the marshal, in the presence of the commissioner, and requested the commissioner to recommit Booth to
the custody of the marshal; and he having failed to recognise
again fof his appearance before the District Court, the commissioner committed him to the custody of the marshal, to be
delivered to the keeper of the jail until lie should be discharged by due course of law.
Booth made application on the next day,-the 27th of May,

SUPREME COURT
Ableman v. Booth and United Statea

v. Booth.

to A. D. Smith, one of the justices of the Supreme Court of
the State of Wisconsin, for a writ of habeas corpus, stating
that he was restrained of his liberty by Stephen V. R. Ableman, marshar of the United States for that district, under the
warrant of commitment hereinbefore mentioned; and alleging
that his imprisonment was illegal, because the act of Congress
of September 18, 1850, was unconstitutional and void; and
also that the warrant was defective, and did not describe the
oflnce created by that act, even if the act were valid.
Upon this application, the justice, on the same day, issued
the writ of habeas corpus, directed to the marshal, requiring
him forthwith to have the body of Booth before him, (the said
justice,) together with the time and cause of his imprisonment.
The marshal thereupon, on the day above mentioned, produced Booth, and made his return, stating that he was received into hiis custody as marshal on the day before, and held
in custody by virtue of the warrant of the commissioner above
mentioned, a copy of which he annexed to and returned with
the writ.
To this return Booth demurred, as not sufficient in law to
justify his detention. And upon the hearing the justice decided that his detention was illegal, and ordered the marshal
to discharge him and set him at liberty, which was accordingly
done.
Afterwards, on the 9th of June, -in the same year, the marshal applied to the Supreme Court of the State for a certiorari,
setting forth in his application the proceedings hereinbefore
mentioned, and charging that the release of Booth by the justice was erroneous and unlawful, and praying that his proceedings might be brought before the Supreme Court of the State
for revision.
The certiorariwas allowed on the same day; and the writ was
accordingly Lssued on the 12th of the same month, and returnable on the third Tuesday of the month; and on the 20th the
return was made by the justice, stating the proceedings, as
hereinbefore mentioned.
The case was argued before the Supreme Court of the State,
and on the 19th of July it pronounceI its judgment, affirming

DECEMBER TERM, 1858.

609

AbZeman v. .Boot and UnTzd States v. Boot&,

the decision of the associate justice discharging Booth from
imprsonment, with costs against Ableman, the marshal.
Afterwards, on the 26th of October, the marshal sued out a
writ of error, returnable to this court on the first Monday of
December, 1854, in order to bring the judgment here for revision; and the defendant in error was regularly cited to appear
on that day; and the record and.proceedings were certified to
this court by the clerk of the State court in the usual form, in
obedience to the writ of error. And on the 4th of December,
Booth, the defendant in error, filed a memorandum in writing
in this court, stating that he had been cited to appear here in
this case, and that he submitted it to the judgment of this court
on the reasoning in the argument and opinions in the printed'
pamphlets therewith sent.
After the judgment was entered in the Supreme Court of
Wisconsin, and before the writ of error was sued out, the State
court entered on its record, that, in the final judgment it had
rendered, the validity of the act of Coongess of September. 18,
1850,. and of February 12, 1793, and the authority of the marshal to hold the defendant in his custody, under the process
mentioned in his return to the writ of habeas copus, were respectively drawn in question, and the decision of the court in
the final judgment was against their validity, respectively.
This certificate was not necessary to give this court jurisdiction, because the proceedings upon their face show that these
questions arose, and how they were decided; but it shows that
at thattime the Supreme Court of Wisconsin did not question
their obligation to obey the writ of error, nor the authority of
this court to re-examine their judgment in the cases specified.
lAnd the certificate is given fqr the purpose of placing distinctly
on the record the points that were raised and decided in that
court, in order that this court might have no difficulty in exercising its appellate power, and pronouncing its judgment upon
all of them.
We come now to the second case. At the January term of
the District Court of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, after Booth had been set at liberty, and after the transcript of the proceedings in the case above mentioned had been

SUPREME COURI.
Ableman v. Booth and United States v. Booth.

returned to and filed in this court, the grand jury found a bill
of indictment against Booth for the offence with which he was
charged before the 6ommissioner, and from which the State
court had discharged him. The indictment was found on the
4th of January, 1855. On the 9th a motion was made, by counsel on behalf of the accused, to quash the indictment, which was
overruled by the court; and he thereupon pleaded not guilty,
upon which issue was joined. On the 10th a jury was called
and appeared in court, when he challenged the array; but the
challenge was overruled and the jury empanelled. The trial,
it appears, continued from day to day, until the Ith, when
the jury found him guilty in the manner and form in which he
stood indicted in the fourth and fifth counts. On the 16th he
moved for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which motions were argued on the 20th, and on the 23d the court overruled the motions, and sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned
for one month, and to pay a fine of $1,000 and the costs of prosecution; and that he remain in custody until the sentence was
2omplied with.
We have stated more particularly these proceedings, from a
sense of justice to the District Court, as they show that every
opportunity of making his defence was afforded him, and that
his case was fully heard and considered.
On the 26th of January, three days after the sentence was
passed, the prisoner by his counsel filed his petition in the
Supreme Court of the State, and with his petition filed a copy
of the proceedings in the District Court, and also affidavits
from the foreman and one other member of the jury who tried
him, stating that their verdict was, guilty on the fourth and
fifth counts, and not guilty on the other three; and stated in
his petition that his imprisonment was illegal, because the fugitive slave law was unconstitutional; that the District Court
had no jurisdiction to, try or punish him for the matter charged
against him, and that the proceedings and sentence of that
court were absolute nullities in law. Various other objections
to the proceedings are alleged, which are unimportant in the
questions now before the court, and aeed not, therefore, be par'ticularly stated. On the next day, the 2"th, the court directed

Ablerman v. Booth and United Sates v. Boot&

two writs of habeas corpus to be issued-one to the marshal, and
one to the sheriff of Milwaukee, to whose actual keeping the
prisoner was committed by the marshal by order of the District Court. The habeas corpus directed each of them to produce the body of the prisoner, andmake known the cause of
his imprisonment, immediately after the receipt of the writ.
On the 80th of January the marshal made his return, not
acknowledging the jurisdiction, but stating the sentence of the
District Court as his authority; that the prisoner was delivered
to, and was then in the actual keeping of the sheriff of Milwaukee county, by order of the court, and he therefore had no control of the body of the prisoner; and if the sheriff had not received him, he should have so reported to the District Court,
and should have con.Veyed him to some other place or prison,
as the court should command.
On the same day -the sheriff produced the body of Booth
before the State court, and returned that he had been committed to his custody by the marshal, by vitue of a transcript,
a true copy of which was annexed to his return, and which
was the only process or authority by which he detained him.
This transcript was a full copy of the proceedings and sentence in the District Court of the United States, as hereinbefore stated. To this return the accused, by his counsel, filed
a general demurrer.,
The court ordered the hearing to be postponed until the 2"4
of February, and notice .to be given to the district attorney 6f
the United States. It was accordingly heard on that.day, anal
on the next, (February 3d,) the court decided, that the imprisonment was illegal, and ordered and adjudged that Booth be,
and -he was by' that judgment, forever' disclharged from that
imprisonment and restraint, and he wqs accordingly set at

liberty.
On .the 21st of April next following, the Attorny General
of 'the United States presented a petition to the Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court, stating briefly the facts in the case, and
at the same time presenting an exemplification, of the proceedings hereinbefore stated, duly certilled by the clerk of the State
court, and averring ija his petition that Lhie State court had no.

jurisdiction in the case, and praying that a writ of error might
issue to bring its judgment before this court to correct the
error. The writ of error was allowed and issued, and, according to the rules and practice of the court, was returnable on the
first Monday of December, 1855, and a citation for the defend
ant in error to appear on that day was issued' by the OL.ef
Justice at the same time.
No return having been made to this writ, the Attorney General, on the 1st of February, 1856, filed affidavits, showing that
the writ of error had been duly served on the clerk of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, at his office, on the 30th of May,
1855, and the citation served on the defendant in error on the
28th of Jutie, in the same year. And also the affidavit of the
district attorney of the United States for the district of Wisconsin, setting forth that when he served the writ of error
upon the clerk, as above mentioned, be was informed by the
clerk, and has also been informed by one of the justices of the
Supreme Court, which released Booth, "that the court had
directed the clerk to make no return to the writ of error, and to enter
no order upon the journals or reco)rds of the court concerning the
same." And, upoi these proofs, the Attorney General movbd
the court for an order upon the clerk to make return to the
writ of error, on or before the first day of the next ensuing
term of this court: The rule was accordingly laid, and on the
22d of July, 1856, the Attorney General filed with the clerk
of this court the affidavit of the marshal of the district ot
Wisconsin, that he had served the rule on the clerk on the
7th of the month above mentioned; and no return having
beeii made, the Attorney General, on the 27th of February,
1857, moved for leave to file the certified copy of the record of
the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which he had produced with
his application for the writ of error, and to docket the case in
this court, in conformity with a motion to that efHct made at
the last ter&. And the court thereupon, on the 6th of March,
1857, ordered the copy of the record filed by the Attorney General to be received and entered on the docket of this court, to
have the same effect and legal operation as if returned by the
clerk with the writ of error, and that the case stand for argu-

ment atthe next,ensuing termn, without further notice to either
-party.
The case was accordingly docketed, but was not reached for
argument in the regular order. and practice of the court until
the present term.
This detailed statement of the pr6ceedings, in the diffetent
courts has appeared to be necessary in order to form a just
estimate of the action of the diffeient tribunals in which it has
been heard, and to account for the delay i the final decision
of a case, which, from its character, would seem to have demanded prompt action. The first case, indeed, was reached
for trial two terms ago. But as the two cases are different
-portions of the samie prosecution for the same offence, they unavoidably, to some extent, involve the same principles 'oflaw,
and it would hardly have beeft proper to hear and decide the
first before the other was -ready for hearing and decision.
They have accordingly been argued together, by the Attorney
General of the United States, at the present term. No counBel has in either case hppeared'for the defendenfin error. But
we have the pamphlet -arguments filed and referred to by
Booth in the first case, as hereinbefore mentioned, also the
,)pinions and arguments of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin,
and of the judges who compose it, in full, and are enabled,
therefore, to see the grounds on which they rely to support
their decisions.
It will be seen, from the foregoing statement of facts, that a
judge of the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin in the
first of these cases, claimed and exercised the right to supervise and annul the proceedipgs of a commissioner of the United
States, and to discharg'e a prisoner, wh had been committed
by the commissioner for an offence against the laws of this
Government, and that this exercise of power by the judge was
afterwards, sanctioned and affirmed by the Supreme Cou of
the State.
, In the second casei the State court has gone a step furtner,
and claimed and exercised jurisdiction over the proceedings
and judgment of a District -Court of the United States, and'
upon a summary and collateral proceeding, by habeas'corpra,VOL.

"'I.33-

SUPREME COURT.
Ableman v, .Booth and United Staes v .Booth.

has set aside and annulled its judgment, and discharged a prisoner who had been tried and found guilty of an offence against
the laws of the United States, and sentenced to imprisonment
by the District Court.
And it further appears that the State court have not only
claimed and exercised this jurisdiction, .but have also determined that their decision is final and conclusive upon all the
courts of the United States, and ordered their clerk to disregard
and refuse obedience to the writ of error issued.by this court,
pursuant to the act of Congress of 1789, to bring here for examination'and revision the judgment of the State court.
These propositions are new in the jurisprudence of the
United States, as well as of the States; and the supremacy of
the State courts over the courts of the United States, in cases
arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States,
is now for the first time asserted and acted upon in the Su.
preme Court of a State.
The supremacy is not, indeed, set forth distinctly and
broadly, in so many words, im the printed opinions of the
judges. It is intermixed with elaborate discussions of different
provisions in the fugitive slave law, and of the privileges and
power of the writ ofhabeas corpus. But the paramount power
of the State court lies at the foundation of these decisions; for
their commentaries upon the provisions of that law, and upon
the privileges and power of the -writ of habeas corpus, were
out of place, and their judicial action upon them without authority of law, unless they had the power to revise and control the proceedings in the criminal case of which they were
speaking; and their judgments, releasing the prisoner, and
disregarding the writ of error from this court, can rest upon
no other foundation.
If the judicial power exercised in this instance has been reserved to the States, no offence against the laws of the United
States can be punished by their own courts, without the permission and according to the judgment of the courts. of the
State in which the party happens to be imprisoned; for, if the
Supreme Court of Wisconsin possessed the power it has exercised in relation to offences against the act of Congress in ques-

Abeman v. Booth and .Uni.d St

•515

v. Booth.

tion, it necessarily follows that they must have the same judicial authority in relation to any other law of the United States;
and, consequently, their supervising and controlling power
would embrdce-the whole criminal code of the United States,
and extend to offences against our revenue laws, or any other
law intended to guard the different departments of the General
Government from fraud or violence. And it would embrace
all crimes, -from the highest "tothe lowest; including felonies,
which are' punished with death, as well as misdemeanors,
which are punished by imprisonment. And, moreover, if the
power is possessed by the Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin, it must belong equally to every other State in the
Union, when the' prisoner is within its territorial limits; and
it is very certain that:the State courts would not always agree
in opinion; and it would .ofti happen, that an act which was
admitted to be an offence, and justly punished, in one State,
would be regarded as-innocent, and indeed as praiseworthy, in
another.
It would seem to be hardly necessary to do more than state
the resdlt to which these decisions of the State courts must
inevitably lead.- It is, of itself, a sufficient and conclusive
answer; for no one will suppose that a Government which has
now lasted nearly seventy years, enforcing its laws by its own
tribunals, and preserving the uhion of the States, could have
lasted a single year, or fulfilled the high trusta committed to
it, if offences against its laws' could. not have been punished
without the consent of the State in which the culprit was
found.
The judges of the Supreme .Court of Wisconsin do not distinctly state from what source they supiose they have derived
this judicial power. There can" be no such thing as judicial
authority, unless it is conferred by a Government or .soverSeight . ; and if the judges and courts of Wisconsin possess the
jurisdiction they claim, they must derive it either from the
United States or the State. It certainly has not been conferred on them by the United States; and it is equally clear it,
was not in the power of the State to confer it, even 'if it had'
attempted to do so; for no State can authorize one .of its judges

SUPREME COURT.
Ableman v. Booth and United States v. Boot.

or courts to exercise judicial power, by habeas corpus or otherwise, within the jurisdiction of another and independent Government. And although the State of Wisconsin is sovereign
within its territorial limits to a certain extent, yet that sovereignty is limited and restricted by the Constitution of the United States. And the powers of the General Government, and
of the State, although both exist and are exercised within the
same territorial limits, are yet separate and distinct sovereignPties, acting separately and independently of each other, within
their respective spheres. And the sphere of action appropriated to the United States is as far beyond the reach of the judicial process issued by a State judge or a State court, as if
the line of- division was traced by landmarks and monuments
visible to the eye. And the State of Wisconsin had no more
power to authorl e these proceedings of its judges and courts,
than it would have had if the prisoner had been confined in
Michigan, or in any other State of the Union, for an offence
against the laws of the State in which he was imprisoned.
It is, however, due to the State to say, that we do not find
this claim of paramount jurisdiction in the State courts over
the courts of the United States asserted or countenanced by
the Constitution or laws of the State. We find it only in the
deciions of the judges of the Supreme Court. Indeed, at
the very time these decisions were made, there was a statute
of the State which declares that a person brought up on a
habeas corpus shall be remanded, if it appears that he is confined:
"1st. By virtue of process, by any court or judge of the United States, in a case where such court or judge has exclusive
jurisdiction; or,
"2d. By virtue of the final judgment or decree of any competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction." ' (Revised Statutes of the State of Wisconsin, 1849, ch. 124, page 629.)
Even, therefore, if these cases depended upon the laws of
Wisconsin, it would be difficult to find in these provisions such
a grant of judicial power as the -Supreme Court claims to have
derived from the 8tate.
But, as we have already said, questions of this kind must

DECEMBER TERM; 1858.

always depend upon the Constitution and laws of the United
States, and not of a State. The Constitution was not formed
merely to guard the States against danger from foreign nations,
but mainly to secure union and harmony at home; for if this
object could be attained, there would be but little danger from
abroad; and to accomplish this purpose, it was felt biy the
statesmen who framed the Constitution, and by the people
who adopted it, that it was necessary that many of the rights
of sovereignty which the States then possessed should be ceded
to the General Government; and that, in the sphere of action
assigned to it, it should be siipreme,. and strong enough to
execute its own laws by its own tribunals, without interruption from a State 'or from State authorities. And it was evident that anything short of this would be inadequate to the
main objects for which the Governmant was established; and
that local interests, local passiozis or prejudices, incited and
fostered by, individuals for sinister purposes, would lead to
acts of aggression and injustice by one State upon the rights
of another, which would ultimately terminate in violence and
force, unless there was a common arbiter between them, armed
with power enough to protect and guard the rights of all, by
appropriate laws, to be carried into execution peacefully by its
judicial tribunals.
The language of the Constitution, by which this power is
granted, is too plain to admit of doubt or to need comment.
It declares that "this Constitution, and the laws of the United
States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all
treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of
the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, arc
the judges in every State shall be bounil thereby, 'anything in
the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."
But the supremacy thus conferred on this Government could
not peacefully be maintained, unless it was clothed wit judicial power, equally paramount in authority to carry it into execution; for if left to the courts of justice of the several States,
confficting decisions would unavoid1ably take place, and the
local tribunals could hardly be expected to be always free

from the local influences of which we have spoken. And the
Constitution and laws and treaties of the United States, and
the powers granted to the Federal Government, would soon
receive different interpretations in different States, and the
Government of the United States wouid soon become one
thing in one State and another thing in another. It was essential, therefore, to its very existence as a Government, that
it should have the power of establishing courts of justice, altogether independent of State power, to carry.into effect its own
laws; and that a tribunal should be established in which all
cases which might arise under the Constitution and laws and
treaties of the United States, whether in a State court or a
court of the United States, should be finally and conclusively
decided. Without such a tribunal, it is obvious that there
would be no uniformity of judicial decision; and that the supremacy,- (which is but another name for independence,) so
carefully provided in the clause of. the Constitution above
referred to, could not possibly be maintained peacefully, unless
it was associated with this paramount judicial authority.
Accordingly, it was conferred on the General Government,
in clear, precise, and comprehensive terms. It is declared that
its judicial power shall (among other subjects enumerated) extend to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that in such cases, as
well as the others there enumerated, this court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as Congress shall make. The
appellate power, it will be observed, is conferred on this court
in all cases or suits in which such a question shall arise. It is
not confined to suits in the inferior courts of the United States,
but. extends to all cases where such a question arises, whether
it be in a judicial tribunal of a State or of the United States.
manifest that this ultimate appellate power in a.tribuAnd it is'

secure the independence and supremacy of the General Gov-.
ernent in the sphere of action assigned to it; to make the.

Ableman v. ooth and United

dtates v. Booth.

inevitably arise from conflicting opinions between the courts
of a State and of the United States, if there was no common
arbiter-authorized to decide between them.
The importance which the framers of the Constitution attached to such a tribunal, for the purpose of preserving internal tranquillity, is strikingly manifested by the clause which
gives this court-jurisdiction over the sovereign States which
compose this Union, when a controveisy arises between them.
Instead of reserving the right to seek redress for injustice from
another State by their sovereign powers, they have bound them:
selves to submit to the decision of this court, and to abide by its
judgment. Andit is not out of place to say, here, that experience has demonstrated that this power was not unwisely surrendered by the States; for in the time that has already elapsed
since this Governmefit came into existence, several irritating
and angry controversies have taken pla. between adjoining
States, in relation to their respective boundaries, and which
have sometimes threatened to end in force and violence, but
for the powei vested in this court to hear them and decide between them.
The same purp6ses are cjearly indicated by the different
language employed when conferring supremacy upon the laws
of the United States; and jurisdiction upon its courts. In the
first case, it providbs,thaf "this Constitution, and the laws of
the United States dich shall be made in pursuance thereof, shall
be the supreme law of the land, and obligatory upon the judges
in every State." The words in italics show the precision and
foresight which marks every clause in the instrument. The
sovereignty to be created was to be limited in its powers of
legislation, and if it passed a law not authorized by its enumerated powers, it was not to be regarded as the supreme law of
the land, nor were the State judges bound to carry it into
execution. And as the courts of a State, andthe courts of the
United -States, might, and indeed certainly would, often differ as to the extent of the powers conferred by the General
Government, it was manifest that serious controversies would
arise between the'authorities of the United States and of the
States, which must be settled by force of arms, unless some

SUPRE ME COURT.
Ableman v. Bootk and United States v. Booth.

tribunal was created to decide between them finally and with
out appeal.
The Constitution has accordingly provided, as far as human
foresight could provide, against this danger. And in conferring judicial power upon the Federal Government, it declares
that the jurisdiction of its courts shall extend to all cases
arising under "this Constitution" and the laws of the United
States-leaving out the words of restriction contained in the
grant of legislative power which we have above noticed. The
judicial power covers every legislative act of Congress, whether
it be made within the limits of its delegated powers, or be an
assumption of power beyond the grants in the Constitution.
This judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable,
not merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United
States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment
upon their reserved rights by the General Government. And
as the Constitution is the fandamental and supreme law, if it
appears that an act of Congress is not pursuant to and within the
limits of the power assigned to the Federal Government, it is
the duty of the courts of the United States to declare It unconstitutional and void. The grant of judicial power is not confined to the administration of laws passed in pursuance to the
provisions of the Constitution, nor confined to the interpretation of such laws; but, by the very terms of the grant, the
Constitution is under their view when any act of Congress is
brought before them, and it is their duty to declare the law
void, and refuse to execute it, if it is not pursuant to the
legislative powers conferred upon Congress. And as the final
appellate power in all such questions is given to this court,
controversies as to the respective powers of the United States
and the States, instead of being determined by military and
physical force, are heard, investigated, and finally settled, with
the calmness and deliberation of judicial inquiry. And no
one can fail to see, that if such an arbiter had not been provided, in our complicated system of government, internal tranquillity could not have been preserved; and if such controver
sies were left to arbitrament of physical force, our Government, State and N'ational, would soon cease to be Governments

of laws, -and revolutions by force of arms would take the place
of courts of justice and judicial decisions.
In organizing suc:4 a tribunal, it is evident that every precaution was taken, which human wisdom could devise, to fit it
for the high duty with which it was intrusted. It was not left
to Congress to create it by. law; for the States could hardly
be expected to confide in the impartiality of a tribunal
created exclusively by the General Government, without any
participation on their part. "And as the performance- of its
duty would sometimes come in conflict with individual ambition or interests, and powerful political combinations, an act
of Congress establishing such a tribunal might be repealed in
order to establish another more subservient to the predominant political influences or excited passions of the day. This
tribunal, therefore, was erected, and the powers of which we
have 4poken conferred upon it, not by the Federal Government, but by the people of the States, who formed and adopted
that Government, and conferred upon it all the powers, legislative, executive, andjudicial, which it now possesses. And in
order to secure its independence, and enable it faithfully and
firmly to perform its duty, it engrafted it upon the Constitution
itsel, and declared that this court should have appellate power
in all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the
United States. So long, therefore, as this Constitution shall
endure, this tribunal must exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial proceeding the angry and irritating controversies between sovereignties, which in other countries
have been determined by the arbitrament of force.
These principles of constitutional law are confirmed and
illustrated by the clause which confers legislative power upon
Congress. That power is specifically given in article 1, section
8, paragraph 18, in the following words:
"To make all laws which shall be, necessary and proper to
cary into execution the foregoing powers, and all other
powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the
United States, or in any department or'officer thereof."
Under this clause of the Constitution, it became the duty of
Congress'to pass such laws as were necessary and proper to

carry into execution the powers vested in the judicial department. And in the performance of this duty, the First Congress,
at its first session, passed the act of 1789, ch. 20, entitled "An
act to establish the judicial courts of the United States." It will be
remembered that many of the members of the Convention
were also members of this Congress, and it cannot be supposed
that they did not understand the meaning and intention of the
great instrument which they had so anxiously and deliberately
considered, clause by clause, and assisted to frame. And the
law they passed to carry into execution the powers vested in
the judicial department of the Government proves, past doubt,
that their interpretation of the appellate powers conferred on
this court was the same with that which we have now given;
for by the 25th section of the act of 1789, Congress authorized
writs of error to be issued from this court to a State court,
whenever a right had been claimed under the Constitution
or laws of the United States, and the decision of the State
court was against it. And to make this appellate power
effectual, and altogether independent of the action of State
tribunals,, this act further provides, that .upon writs of etror
to a State court, instead of remanding the cause for a final
decision in the State court, this court may at their discretion, if the cause shall have been once remanded before,
proceed to a final decision of the same, and award execution.
These provisions in the act of 1789 tell- us, in language not
,to be mistaken, the great importance which the patriots and
statesmen of the First Congress attached to this appellate
power, and the foresight and care with which they guarded its
free and independent exercise against interference or obstruc.
tion by States or State .tribunals.
In the case before the Supreme "Court of Wisconsin, a right
was claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United
States, and the decision was against the right claimed; and it
refuses obedience to the writ of error, and regards its own
judgment as final. It has not only reversed and annulled the
judgment of the fDistrict Court of the United States, but it has
reversed and annulled the provisions of the Constitution, itself,

and theact of Congress of 1789, and made the superior and
appellate tribunal the inferior and subordinate one.
We do not question the authority of State court, or judge,
who is authorized by the laws of the State to issue the writ
of habeas corpus, to issue it in any case where the party is imprisoned within its territorial limits, provided it does not appear, when the application is made, that the person imprisoned
is in custody under the authority of the United States. The
court or judge has a right to inquire, in this mode of proceeding, for what cause and by what authority the prisoner is confined within the territorial limits of the State sovereignty.
And it is the duty of the marshal, or other person having the
custody of the prisoner, to make known to the judge or court,
by a. proper return, the authority by which he holds him in
custody. This right to inquire by process of habeas corpus,
and the duty of the officer to make a return, grows, necessarily,
out of the complex character of our Government, and the existence of two distinct and separate sovereignties within the
same territorial space, each of them restricted in its powers,
and each within its sphere of action, prescribed by the Constitution of the United States, independent of the other. But,
after the return is made, and the State judge or court judicially apprized that the party is in custody under the authority of
the United States, they can proceed no further. They then
know that the prisoner is within the dominion and jurisdi6tion of another Government, and that neither the writ of habeas
corpus, nor any other process issued under State authority, can
pass' over the line of division between the two sovereignties.
He is then within the dominion and exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States. If he has committed an offence against
their laws, their tribunals alone can punish him. If he is
wrongfully imprisoned, their judicial tribunals can release him
and afford him redress. And although, as we have said, it is
the duty of the marshal, or other person holding him, to make
known, by a proper return, the authority under which he detains him, it is at the same time imperatively his ddty to
obey the process of the United. Statea, to hold the prisoner in
custody under it, and to refuse obedience to the mandate or

process of any other Government. And conseq.uejitly it is his
duty not to take the prisotner:o-ni suffer.him to be taken, before a State judge or court upoh ahakey eorpu-issued under

him, or to require him to be brought before them. And if the
authority of a State, in the form of judicial process or otherwise, should attempt to control the marshal dr other authorized officer or agent of the United States, in any respect, in
the custody of his prisoner, it would be his duty to resist it,
and to cill to his aid any force that might 'be necessary to
maintain the authority of law against illegal interference. No
judicial process, whatever form it may assume, can have any
lawful authority outside of the limits of the jurisdiction of the
court or judge by whom it is issued; and an attempt to enforce
it beyond thes boundaries is nothing less than lawless violence.
Nor is there anything in this supremacy of the General Government, or the jurisdiction of its judicial tribunals, to awaken
the jealousy or-offend the natural and just pride of State sovereignty. Neither this Government, nor the powers of which
we are speaking, were forced upon the States. The Constitution of the United States, with all the powers conferred by it
on the General Government, and surrendered by the States,
was the voluntary act of the people of the several States, deliberately done, for their own protection and safety against
injustice from one another. And their anxiety to preserve it
in full force, in all its powers, and to guard against resistance
to or evasion of its authority, on the part of a State, is proved
by the clause which requires that the members of the State
Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers of the several States, (as well as those of the General Government,) shall
be bound, by oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution.
This is the last and closing clause of the Constitution,' and inserted when the whole frame of Government, with the powers
hereinbefore specified, had been adopted by the Convention;
and it was in that form, ind with these powers, thai the Con-

stitution was submitted to the people of the several States, for
their consideration and decision.
Now, it certainly can be no humiliation to the citizen of a
republic to yield a ready obedience to the laws as administered
by the constituted authorities. On the contrary, it is among
his first and highest duties as a citizen, because free government cannot exist without it. Nor can it be inconsistent with
the dignity of a sovereign State to observe faithfully, and in
the spirit of sincerity and truth, the compact into which it voluntarily entered when it became a State of this Union. On
the contrary, the highest honor of sovereignty is untarnished
faith. And certainly no faith could be more deliberately and
solemnly pledged than that which every State has plighted to
the other States to support the Constitution as it is, in all its
provisions, until they shall be altered in the manner which the
Constitution itself prescribes. In the emphatic language of
the pledge required, it is to support this Constitution. And .no
power is-more clearly conferred by the Constitution and laws
of the United States, than the power of this court to 'decide,
ultimately and finally, all cases .arising under such Constitution and laws; and for that -purpose to bring here for revision,.
by writ of error, the judgment of a State court, where such
questions have arisen, and the right claimed under them denied by the highest judicial tribunal in the'State.
W\Te are sensible that we have extended the examination of
these decisions beyond the limits required by any intrinsic difficulty in the questions. Bat the decisions in question were
made by the supreme judicial tribunal of the State; and when
a court so elevated in its position has pronounced a judgment
which, if it 6ould be maintained, would subvert the very foundations of this Government, it seemed to be the duty of this
court, when exerdising its. appellate power, to show plainly the
grave errors into whi~h the State court has fallen, and the consequences to which they watild inevitably lead.
But it can~hardly be necessary to point out the errors which
followed their mistaken view of the jurisdiction they might
lawfully exercise; because, if there was any defect of power in
the commissioner, or in his mode of proceeding, it was for the

526

tribunals of the United States to revise and correct it, and not
for a State court. And as .regards the decision of the District
Court, it had exclusive and final jurisdiction by the laws of the
United States; and neither the regularity of its proceedings
nor-the validity of its sentence could be called in question in
any other court, either of a State or the United States, by habeas corpus or any other process.
But although we think it unnecessary to discuss these questions, yet, as they have been decided by the State court, and
are before us on the record, and we are not willing to be misunderstood, it is proper to say that, in the judgment of this
court, the act of Congress commonly called the fugitive slave
law is, in all of its provisions, fully authorized by the Constitution of the United States; that the commissioner had lawful
authority to issue the warrant and commit the party, and that
his proceedings were regular and conformable to law. We
have already stated the opinion and judgment of the court as
to the ex(lusive jurisdiction of the District Court, and the appellate powers which this court is authorized and required to
exercise. -And if any argument was needed to show the wis4om and necessity of this appellate power, the cases before us
sufficiently prove it, and at the same time emphatically call for
its exercise.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin must
therefore be reversed in each of the cases now before the
court.
