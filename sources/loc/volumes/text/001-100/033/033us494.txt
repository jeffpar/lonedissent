SUPREME COURT.

THE

UNITED STATES, APPELLANTS V. WILLIAM GIBSON ET AL.
HEIRS Or FRANCIS

P.

FATIO, DECEASED.

Confirmation of the decree of the superior court of East Florida, in favour of
a grant of land to Francis P. Fatio.

APPEAL from the superior court of East Florida.
The case was submitted by Mr Call, for the United States;
and by Mr White, for the appellees.
Mr Chief Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the
Court.
This was a grant made by governor Grant, of East Florida,
for ten thousand acres of land whilst that province was under
the dominion of Great Britain, and another grant made by
governor Tomyn, to Francis P. Fatio, for seven hundred and
sixty acres. The first tract was conveyed by regular deeds to
the ancestor of the petitioners.
The same questions are involved as in the zase of the heirs
of Francis P. Fatio. It is therefore considered by the court,
that the decree of the superior court of East Florida be affirmed.

This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the
record from the superior court for the eastern district of Florida,
and was argued by counsel; on consideration whereof, it is
ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court, that the decree of
the said superior court in this cause be, and the same is hereby
affirmed in all respects.
